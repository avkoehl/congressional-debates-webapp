APPENDIX TO THE CONQ-EESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 17,
Ho. of Beps.
Seduction of the Army—Mr. Butler.
40th Cong....3d Sess.
Mr. O'NEILL. During the war the Marine
■corps, owing to the wants and necessities of
%he serviee, was increased to three thousand
men and a sufficient number of officers to com-
mand them. The corps still exists as it was
■organized then, and hence there is a brigadier
general.
Mr. BUTLEB, of Massachusetts. In my
judgment the proposition should be to cut
■down that corps—although I have a high
respect for the marines—to about eight hun-
dred, or at the most twelve hundred men, which
is a fair colonel's command.
Passing from this, however, I am only speak-
ing of the number of brigadier generals that
we should have in the Army. We have dwelt
•upon this part of the subject too long. The
.proposition is to/educe the number of briga-
dier generals to six, and to cut the chiefs of
staff departments down to colonels. Now, there
is this objection raised, and it is fair for the
Army and for everybody else to say that in this
■country from the beginning there has always
fceen a general at the head of the quartermas-
ter's department. Sometimes that general was
•a major general; and that officer was the only
•brigadier general of the staff department before
tlie war. All the rest of the chiefs of staff
■departments were colonels ; some of them only
colonels by brevet. But from October 1, 1776,
there has always been either a major general
•or a brigadier general at the head of the quar-
termaster's department; and if gentlemen, out
•of respect to the traditions of the Army, still
desire to retain a brigadier general at the head
■of that department I shall not have much
difficulty in regard to it.
But passing from that, the next proposition—
3ind here comes the struggle—is to cut down
the staff of the Army one half. This staff is
now as large as it was when we had all our
armies in the field during the rebellion ; I mean,
of course, the Army staff proper, not the med-
ical staff or the assistant adjutant general's or
the paymaster's. Under the present circum-
stances, I think if we have a staff which is
acknowledged to be sufficient for an army of
fifty thousand men, it may bo cut down "one
half when we reduce the Army to twenty-five
thousand men. It is proposed, therefore, that
the staff department shall be cut down one
half in each grade, to be selected by the Pres-
ident in the manner hereafter to be stated. At
this poipt will come the contest over this bill,
and here is the first great departure I make
from the bill of the Committee on Military
Affairs. The bill of the Military Committee
■does not provide for the mustering out a sin-
gle man or a single officer—not one. And if
you pass it you will not thereby get rid of a
man or an officer or save a dollar of expense.
My friend, the chairman of the Committee
■on Military Affairs, [Mr. Garfield,] says that
by the bill of the committee the Army will be
gradually reduced. I beg his pardon, not so.
Under his bill it will be reduced only by the act
•of Almighty God and the vices of the officers,
and in no other way. Every man or officer is
left by it to remain in the Army until he dies
or resigns.
That leads me to remark just hero upon
what is termed the consolidation of the supply
departments. My friend from Ohio [Mr. Gar-
field] says that he has consolidated sixty-five
■officers out -of the supply departments by con-
solidating the eommissary and quartermaster's
and pay departments into one. I agree that
there is a consolidation provided for, but it is
■simply a consolidation -ot departments, leaving
the officers now in them doing nothing and
drawing full pay. Do I misstate the bill of
the committee? If so, I am willing to be cor-
rected.
Mr- GARFIELD. The gentleman does mis-
state it most deeidedly.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Very well;
how? . J 1
Mr. GARFIELD-. The bill to which the gen-
tleman refers provides that the President of
the United States shall, as rapidly as the pub-
lic service will permit, proceed to consolidate
the officers of those departments. It is pre-
sumed that so important and radical a change
as that cannot be made in a day or even in a
month, but it must be done gradually and care-
fully; and by the time it is fully accomplished
we believe the gradual process of absorption
will have reduced the number of officers.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I have
heard the gentleman's explanation, and repeat
what I said, I have not misstated his bill. Not
one officer is cut off by his bill. That is to be
done only by "absorption." And if the bill
of the committee is to be passed I want to have
the title of the bill changed so that it will read
"A bill to reduce the Army by absorption."
That is to say, not one of these officers is to
be required to go out of the Army until he
goes by death or resignation.
I propose to strike out of the six hundred
and fifty-one officers of these staff departments
one half of them. Out of the two departments
proposed by the committee's bill to be con-
solidated I propose to take out ninety-one
officers, while the bill of the committee pro-
poses to take out sixty-five officers, when they
are ready to go. Therefore I ask if I am not
right when I say that all the bill of the com-
mittee proposes to do is to let the President
consolidate these departments, turn these offi-
cers out of the departments, but not out of the
Army, leaving them nothing to do and drawing
full pay.
The whole question resolves itself into this:
shall we muster out the supernumerary officers
of the Army ? And, gentlemen of the House
of Representatives, I look upon this as the
most vital question which has ever come before
this House ; for if we cannot muster out the
supernumerary officers of our Army, then, in-
deed, are our liberties placed at the footstool
of the armed forces of the Republic.
What is the argument against mustering out
these supernumerary officers ? Why, sir, we
are told that we must not muster out officers
of the Army because they have made the Army
a profession, because they have received a mil-
itary education at the public expense, because
they have pursued that profession almost from
their boyhood, and it is not right to muster
them out in their old age. Now, I want the
attention of this House to a table showing some
facts with reference to this argument, which'I
think members will be surprised to learn ; and
I refer for the verification of these facts to the
official Register.

Thus it will be seen that in the cavalry the
total number of officers is 440, of whom 63
are from West Point, 377 from civil life, only
fifteen per cent, being from West Point. Now,
sir, if these cavalry officers from West Point
must not be turned out to be dependent upon
their own resources, we had better pension
them for life, and turn out the volunteer offi-
cers, the men who, like the rest of us, went
into the Army, making it their profession only
as we made it a profession, and who ought to be
ready to go out as we went out. We shall thus
save a great expense to the country. Of the
artillery officers 194 are from civil life, and 141
from West Point, or about forty-two and a half
per cent, of the whole number. The total num-
ber of infantry officers is 1,489, of whom 171,
or eleven and a half per cent, only, are from
West Point. Now, if we can get on in no other
way, I, for one, am in favor of pensioning
these 171 West Point officers, if that be ne-
cessary in order to get at the officers who have
not made the Army a profession. Did these
volunteer officers make the Army a profession
any more than the volunteer soldiers ? Many
of these men went into the Army side by side
with us ; and they are no more entitled to con-
tinue therein for life than the rest of us. And
it was the glory of this country that the volun-
teer army, without, a murmur, suffered them-
selves to be mustered out; and many of them
returning to civil life found their homes deso-
lated, their old associations broken up, their
business ruined, so that they were obliged, as
it were, to start life anew. But we heard from
them no murmur. And shall these, our com-
rades, who fought as well as we but no better;
who suffered with us as much, and no more ;
who left their homes and their business as well
as we did, and no more; and who are no better
than we are, insist that they have made arms a
profession, and are better than we are; and
that, therefore, they who by grace and favor
or by political influence or otherwise have been
put into the Army shall remain a burden upon
the country forever, when their services are
not longer wanted ?
Again, among the field officers, I find that of
the whole number, 349,135 are from West Point
—thirty-nine per cent. Of the general officers,
25 in all, 21 are from West Point, and 4 only
from civil life. Of the Army staff, numbering
681, 207 are from West Point and 474 from civil
life, those from West Point being thirty and a
half per cent, of the whole number. Of the
staff department proper, however, embracing
the Adjutant General's office, the engineer
corps, &c., 249 officers in all, 229 are from West
Point, and only 20 from civil life. Thus all the
soft places in the Army are in possession of
West Point, and they are naturally averse to
giving them up.
It will be found that while of the cavalry offi-
cers fifteen per cent, are from West Point,
while of the field officers thirty-two and a half
per cent, are from West Point, in the artil-
lery there is only forty-two per cent. You will
find among the higher officers fifty and a half
percent., while in the infantry there is only
eleven per cent, of West Point officers. Let the
country mark these facts, and see if we need to
expend $30,000,000needlessly upon these men.
