GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF TENNESSEE,
 Florence, Ala., November 20, 1864.

Numbers 35.

The commanding general announces to the army that on the march we are about commencing there may be a scarcity of the bread ration. He confidently appeals to the officers and men to meet this privation, should it come, in a cheerful, manly spirit with which they have heretofore encountered similar and greater hardships. The privation, at most, will be of short duration, and while it lasts the meat ration can be proportionately increased. The fruitful fields of Tennessee are before us, and as we march to repossess them let us remember that the country we traverse, perhaps with hunger, was a rich and bountiful land till wasted by the enemy, that similar desolation awaits every portion of our country relinquished to the invader, and let the privation be to us not a cause of murmuring, but an incentive and an occasion for the exhibition of a most determined patriotism.

By command of General Hood:

A. P. MASON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
