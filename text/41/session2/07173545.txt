Hair,.'the gentlewaa from Wisconsin [Mr.
WashbursTsaid that' not atfl jwas" the pay of
the officers of lie Nivy: increased iu 1860, but
again in 1862; now in this latter statement the
gentleman who is jisuaUy so"accurate ia clearly
Wong. The act of July IS, 1862, established
grad'es in tlfe uaval service as follows: nine
rear admirals, to-rank with major generals of
the Af o jr; eighteen commodores, td rink with
brigadier generate0f the Army ; "thirty-six cap-
tains, to rank with colonels of the Army ; eev-'
only-two commanders, to rank-with lieutenant
colonels of the Amy; oae-hunctred and forty-
four lieutenant tfommaodeM, to tank with
majors of the Army '; one hundred and forty-
fotlr lieutenants, to rank with eapt&ins of the
Army. . , '
Now, although these new offices were cre-
ated, yet we find the pay" of all these officers
under thataet was less than under the act of
I860, as the following table shows:
9 rear admirals, at #5,000    §46,000
18eommdtfo^3, at S4.00J  72.000
36 captains, at $3,500.:  126,l)0p
72 copnnanders, at $2,8U0  201,600
144 lieutenant commanders, at $2,84U.    336,'JOO
144 lieutenants, at 81 ,875....   270,POJ
Total pay under act of 1862. '. $1,051,500
Having reductiop'tp the amount of $225,140
per annum, instead of an increase,-.^ stated by
the gentleman iroiji Wisconsin. This heavy
reduction was made in the pay of those officers
of the line who alone from their age and ex-
perience in the service had to be relied upon
tp take ch^igg pi' and fight the vessels:of the
Navy in the midst of a most sanguinary war,
. . ... ,. hardships and ris^s of health,
when Ine currency of the country was only
; worth from about one third to one half its
: nominal value, and when every necessary of
. life for themselves and families were bringing
fabulous prices. It will be observed that the
change of titles of nine captains out of the
seventy-eight to that of rear admirals carried
, with it no mcrcase of pay; while eighteen of
the same, captains called commodores had
had their pay reduced from $4^200 to $4,000
per annum, at sea, thirty-six of the remaining
j captains had tjieir pay reduced from $4,200 to
$3,500 per annum., and the whole number of
'i captains was reduced from seventy-eight to
sixty-thrpe,'or a total reduction of nearly one
fifth., 'Of the one hupdred and t>yelve com-
manders but seventy-two were retained at a
, reduced rate of pay, namely, from $3,150 to
$2j80Q per annum. The lieutenants com*
; ina.nders w.ere increased from twelve at $2,550
; to one hundred and forty-four at $2,340 per
auuum. The lieutenants, whose highest pay
was S3,250 and lowest $1,509, were fixed at tho
yniform.pay of $1,875 per auuum.
Tlie'reduction in the pay of captqins palled
.. commodores and of those captains who re*
! t'ained the game title, jn the on,e case of $200
and in the other of $700,per year, and of the
commanders from $3,150 to $2)800, was a gr.eat
, hardship and caused much pecuniary distress
to the greater part of them. Few.qf these have
, yet recovered from the embarrassment this
caiiseU. It may be said that, the prize-money
received in a measure compensated for this;
. that relief, however, extended only to a few^the
, other officers occupying equally responsible
positipns receiving nothing from that source.
When this reduction in pay took placs it was
on the plea that it was to enable the Govern -
; ment to carry on the war, and that they were
: told that the increase of rank must be regarded
t as a compensation, or, in other words, that
' they must be content to live on one fifth less
in currency than they had previously received
in gold without taxation. I do not think that
the officer? of the Navy are mercenary, nor are
they oblivious or indifferent to the fact that the
1 people of the cqimi'ry are burdened by an
enormous taxation. They pay their five per
cent, by a deduction from their pay without the
1 benefit that othershave in regard to house rent,
repairs, &c., and at one time during the war j
had eight per centMand at another {.nine ten pgr j
cent, deducted from their pay. The sight per j
cent, .was all paid at one time, although it was
a levy for two years, and the tep per cent, was j
paid' at another time for two other years, the
lav/ having been made retroactive in its effect. |
It was thus that matters stood when the Stat- 1
utes:at-Laj:ge, volume fourteen, page 38, state ,
I that a section of the naval appropriation bill,
which passed April 17^1856, enapted the fol*
lowing: ■ ' . ' • ;
' AiuL be -kfarilier cuiicted, That, so much of the see- 1
ond section of Ten act' 'entitled 'An'act to regulate !
ttfo'payofthoN"aVy of the United States,' approved
Mareh^il, l&i-i, as prohibits ajiy allowance to amy ,
: officer in" (,hq naval service for rent of quarters or for ■
furniture; 01* fo'r lights, or file], or transporting bag-
gage,and all acts and parts! of acts authorizing the
apppintmput <jf ?ft Vy ageuts, be, and the same are
hereby, repealed.'' '
; So stands the l^w? if the Statutes-at-Large
are to be tjikep as evidence; but'the Cpngres- i
sional Glqbe states, on page 1448, volume fifty- ;
seven, that Senator Grimes offered as amend- |
; ment Ijo', 11 to.|lo^ge bill No. 122 (being the
, naval appropriation |iili) the following words : .
'' Jle it farther enqct&J, <fce., That tho second Beetion :
of an act catitled" An act to regulate tho pay of tfie
IfaVy of th« United Btate?l!'appi'oved March 3,1635, :
and all aets or parts of aits authorizing the appoint-
ment of Navy agentaj, h$, and tUe  fvmo are hereby, ;
repealed-." ' .
Which words w.ere^doptesdaa an amendment ■
1 tp the bill. The bill was' passed by the Sen-
ate, came back to the Hqu^e, and the House re-
fused to concur iu severed amendments, among !
which was the aniendment of Mr., Grimes, ;
known as No. U. Conference committees were 1
then ^ppoiiited. On the part of the Senate 1
were Messrs. Grimes, Morgan, and Hendricks;
and on the part of the House were Messrs.
Baxics, Farnswoutii, and C. E. Phelps. The
result of this conference committee was the
adoption of the amendment of Mr. Grimes,
known as No. 11, which amendment totally
repealed section two of the act of March 3.
1835. Now the difference between the Stat-
utes-at^Large and the records of Congress as
kept h,i the Globe is that the statutes partially
repeal, if the gentleman from Wisconsin be
right in his construction of the law, section two
. of tlje act of 1835, and the Globe shows an
: entire (repeal oi* that section.
• The g,entletpan from Wisconsin [Mr. Was 11-
EUBjrJ states that after the disagreement of
the House to the Senate amendment the con-
ference committee .agreed to the partial repeal
; of gection twq, and he states this after having
stated thjit he had " lqojced over the Congres-
: sional Globe." The Glolxj states ;w such thing,
; but gives the report of the conference commit-
tee in full, in which report, signed by all six
| of thp conferees above named, (tj^9 whom
: are now members of the House,) that amend-
; ment No. 11 of the Senate was agreed to.
| But if the $tal;utes-at-Large and the gentl^pian
from Wisconsin are right, and the Congressional
Globe is ^rong, I would respectfully state that
110 suel} forced construction as that contended
for by tliQ gentleman can be maintained. IL3
won Id have us believe tjjat although the act
! of 180G stated - that so njuch of the act of
I 1835 as prohibits allowance to any officer it
, the naval service for rent of quarters, or for
| furnitureror for nghts, or for fuel, or for trans-
portation of b^gage is hereby repealed," than
110 such act could be'made, because that act
stated— "
"It is hereby expressly declared, that tho yearly
allowance provided in this act is all the pay,"com-
pensation, and allowance (!hat shall 'Ijo received
under any circumstances whatever hyrsucb officer
or person^ except fof traveling expenses," &c. ■
How, Mr. Chairman, can any fair-minded
 ng.ii say that such a construction is possible?
H would i>e jpgt; as reasQrtable to say that,
although the act- of J.860 bii4 18G2 fis.ed dif-
ferent j>ay-rolls, yet thoa  ^p«y-&>WS could  o-
be enfbrcedibecanse a foregoing elftflgerof the
 ct'of 1835 "onee stood on thp statuto-book.
Thus stood the' liw yhen B^eretary Welles
issued General Qrder No. 75;
Navy Department, May 23,1866.
Congress having, in view of tho call for increased
GQippiensatiou to oncers of tbe' }STavy-, repealed tho
law whign prohibited any allowance to them "for

hibition, deems'it propfer to establish a fi^edi-ate Of

of midshipmen and mates, the allowance hereby
