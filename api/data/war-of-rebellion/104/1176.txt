HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, March 30, 1865.

Colonel GARNER,

Chief of Staff, Mobile:

I urgently request that you send me the men I telegraphed for Lieutenant Artemus O. Sibley. One hundred cavalry are hovering around us, trying to join the enemy's force here, and it is important that they should be intercepted.

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MARCH 30, 1865.

Colonel GARNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Mobile, Ala.:

General Liddell and I both think that no men should be taken away for a few days. This is a school of instruction for the Reserves; they are daily improving as soldiers and are well pleased. The enemy presses at all points, especially my left flank. I have a great deal of work to do there upon the main line and I must re-establish my skirmish line. For these reasons, I hope you will let matters remain as they are.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.
