Mr. LOGAN. I have had in my desk for a
month a bill from the Senate (S. No. 512) for
the relief of Captain Phelps Paine, which I
desire to put upon its passage. Having passed
the Senate, it was reierred to the Committee
on Military Affairs of the House, and the com-
mittee reported unanimously in favor of it.
The bill was read. It provides for the pay-
ment to Captain Phelps Paine of $2,030 30, in
full payment for services rendered as sergeant
major in the months of November and Decem-
ber, 1861, and as first lieutenant and aid-de-
camp from the 1st day of January, 1862, to the
25:li day of March, 1863.
The SPEAKER. The question is on order-
ing the bill to be read a third time. Is there
objection?
Mr. COX. 1 object. The House is about to
adjourn, and the bill is not understood.
'Mr. LOGAN. If the gentleman will allow
me I will explain it in one or two seconds.
This gentleman was aeommissioned officer who
served during the war, but who has never drawn
his pay on account of some informality in his
muster ; and this is to pay him according to his
commission and his services.
Mr. COX. Why is he not paid by the Depart-
inent?
Mr. LOGAN. On account of the inform-
al]! y in his muster they refused to pay him.
Mr. RANDALL. It will not establish any
vicious principle?
Mr. LOGAN. Not at all.
Mr. COX. You are sure that it is not a bad
precedent?
Mr. LOGAN. It is not.
Mr. COX. Then I withdraw the objection.
The bill was ordered to a third reading; and
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. LOGAN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
