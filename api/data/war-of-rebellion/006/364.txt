With great respect and esteem, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS,Coosawhatchie, December 31, 1861.

General S. R. GIST,

Adjutant and Inspector General South Carolina:

GENERAL: General Ripley, commanding in Charleston, reports that the line of intrenchments for the defense of that city may be considered as completed except those between the Cooper and Ashley Rivers. He also reports that he is entirely without troops to defend them, those not required at the forts and batteries being advanced on James Island and beyond the Stono to check the approach and marauding parties of the enemy.

The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Regiments South Carolina Volunteers, as soon as equipped for the field, will be sent to General Evans for similar service. Will you be kind enough to inform me when you can place in the field the other regiments of the State you have called into service?

It will give me pleasure to meet you in Charleston, as proposed in your dispatch of yesterday, after my return from Savannah, where I shall go to-day.

R. E. LEE.
