THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 1,
chair,) and proceeded to the consideration of the
bill to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1848.
Me, ROCKWELL, of Connecticut, being en-
titled to the floor, rose and addressed the commit-
tee as follows:
When the loan bill, with the pro-posed amend-
ment of the minority of the Committee of Ways
and Means, was imcler discussion, it was my pur-
pose to have addressed the House in relation to
those measures, and especially the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury on the finances. I failed
to do so at that time, but suppose it to be quite
pertinent to the bill now before the House to pre-
sent my views in relation to that report.
In common with the public at large, I was aston-
ished. when it was announced, after the lapse of
more than a month from the time when the Sec-
retary made his report to Congress, that he had
discovered an error of about seven millions of
dollars in his original estimate. It seemed incredi-
ble that so gross and disgraceful a mistake should
have been made, in any form, by any head of the
Treasury Department. It was supposed that, at
least, the error must have been one of estimate
merely; but when it appeared, on the examination
of the supplemental report of the department, and
the tables m the report, referred to, that it was a
misstatement of the amount of funds actually re-
ceived into the treasury, of the avails of treasury
notes during the first quarter of the present fiscal
year; that the Secretary had in his hands seven mil-
lions of available means more than he was aware
of, and that the amount of the loan asked for by
him could be reduced to that amount, the amaze-
ment of the intelligent business portion of the
public was unbounded. After such an exhibition
of gross ignorance of the condition of the depart-
ment; after so grievous an error in the statement
of the matter which was the very gist of his report,
which remained undetected for a month and ten
days after the report hnd been sent to Congress,
I came to the examination of this document with
the utmost distrust m its accuracy, which has been
fully justified, as I think, m the result; and I expect
to substantiate the following propositions:
1. That, deducting the actual and estimated re-
ceipts for the two years ending 30th June, J848,
(including the entire amount of treasury notes au-
thorized by the acts of July 23, 1846', and January
28, 1847,) from the actual and estimated expendi-
tures for the same period, there remains, on the
basis of the report itself, an amount to be provided
by loan—an excess of expenditures over receipts—
greater by more than $1,132,000 than the amount
shown by the Secretary or provided for in the loan
bill.
2. That this amount is shown by a subsequent
statement, furnished me by the Register of the
Treasury, to be larger than the above sum, as a
portion of the expenses charged under the head of
redemption of treasury notes and loans, during the
last fiscal year and the first quarter of the present
fiscal year, was for payments made on account of
prior 1 (Kins and for interest; and that by these two
reports, taken together, it will appear that the ex-
cess of expenditure on the 1st July, 1«48, would
be, instead of £1,132,000, more than $1,500,000
more than the amount of the estimates of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury.
3. That the amount of avails of treasury notes
actually received for the last, and the first quarter
of the present, fiscal year, and the amount esti-
mated as available, exceed by more than five mil-
lions the whole amount authorized; and if from
this is deducted, as it should be, the amount of
treasury notes redeemed during the same period,
there is still an exccss of more than #1,500,000 of
avails of treasury notes, actual and estimated, over
and above the amount authorized to be issued, on
the supposition that the amount of treasury notes
actually redeemed is truly stated in the tables for
the first quarter of the present fiscal yonr.
4. That the explanatory statement of the Regis-
ter of the Treasury furnishes no satisfactory ex-
planation, and is shown on its face to be erroneous
to an amount exceeding $135,000 m the result at
which it arrives.
5. That the amount of treasury notes for the
first quarter, as stated in table B, attached to the
report, is not correctly stated; that the whole
amount actually received during the quarter from
customs, as shown by table IvK, and from public
lands, as shown by table X, was the sum of
$39,350; that the amount stated in table B, for re-
demption^ treasury notes, of $2,385,329, includes
the amount of notes funded, which is m no sense
a redemption of the notes, and in no way reduces
the amount of the avails of the notes previously
received, as stated on the other side of the account;
that this appears from other tables attached to the
report; thus showing that in this statement there
was an error of more than $2,300,000; and if the
statement is correct, of the avails of treasury notes
during this quarter, the mistake of the Secretary
is more than $3,300,000.
6. That, according to these tables, the amount
of treasury notes available for the residue of the
present fiscal year, after the first quarter, instead
of being, as stated by the Secretary, $6,285,294
55, would be only about §2,800,000, thus showing
an over-estimate of the available means of about
three and a half millions of dollars.
7. That the statement of the amount of public
debt and interest paid during the year ending De-
cember 1,1847,is more than $10,400,000,as shown
by table E, and less, as shown by table &, than
$9,300,000 for seventeen months, embracing the
period mentioned in table E.
I am aware, sir, that I am making a very serious
charge, and one which, if sustained by the papers
to which I shall refer, will show the head of this
department to be i^ost grossly incompetent to the
station which he fills, ft is made with great sin-
cerity, at least, and after a careful examination. If
I did not suppose the results to which I have ar-
rived demonstrable as well as true, I should not
make any such assertion, and 1 am quite desirous
that the members of the Committee of Ways and
Means, or any other gentleman in the House who
shall suppose that I am wrong, should, while I am
speaking, correct any statement which I may make
if in his opinion erroneous.
The main problem to be solved is, upon the
basis of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury
of the actual and estimated expenditures and means
of payment for the two years ending July 1,1848,
what will be the amount to be provided for on that
day by the way of loan ?
This proposition appears to me to be a very
simple one, and to the solution of which it is not
at all difficult to arrive. The amount of actual and
estimated expenditures is given in the report of the
Secietary of the Treasury for the two years. The
amount of the actual and estimated receipts is
given also during the same period. These means
of payment are from three sources only: 1. The
balance on hand on the 1st of July, 1846, the com-
mencement of the two years. 2. The ordinary
receipts from the customs, public lands, and mis-
cellaneous sources. 3. The amount of the- loans
authorized during the same period by Congress.
It is evident, therefore, if you leave out of con-
sideration the loans of 1846 and 1847, and the
amount to be received from that source, deducting
the amount of notes redeemed, the amount of the
balance on hand added to the amount of actual and
estimated receipts being deducted from the amount
of expenditures actual and estinated during the
same period, will give the balance to be provided
for on the 1st of July, 1848. If from this amount
you deduct the total amount of the two loans au-
thorized, the balance must necessarily be the sum
to be provided for at the end of the year.
In this view of the matter, which I begin by
placing in its most simple form, it is perfectly cer-
tain that nothing more in any way can be made
out of the loan of $33,000,000 than, if sold at par,
the precise amount; or, if s^ld at a fraction above
par, the trifling amount in addition; and no process
of ciphering, no combination of figures, no mathe-
matics, cither m the Treasury Department or else-
where, can vary the result In this view of the
subject, it is quite unimportant whether the loan
has been negotiated or not, whether it is all in the
form of money in the treasury, or m the form of
scrip or treasury notes in the hands of the Secre-
tary, which may be made available for the use of
the treasury. The result is the same; nothing
more can be made out of this loan, at par, than the
sum of $33,000,000.
It appears, however, by the report, that the
avails of treasury notes and loans durino- the year
ending 1st of July, 1847, was $25,679,199 45. It
also appears, on the other side of the same state-
ment, that there was paid for the " redemption
of treasury notes during the year," the sum of
$2,361,397 07, which, being deducted, leaves the
net amount of avails of treasury notes during the
year to be the sum of $23,217,702 38; and if this
is deducted from the amount of the two loans, the
whole amount of available means from treasury
notes for the present year would be only the sum
of ^782,297 62.
This was the whole amount of treasury notes
available at the end of the fiscal year ending June
30,1847. If from this you deduct in the first place,
the amount of avails of treasury notes and loan
for the first quarter, less the amount redeemed an&
returned into the treasury, you have the whole
amount, on the Secretary's own showing, of the
treasury notes available for the residue of the pres-
ent fiscal year.
In order to present this matter at the glance of
the eye, I give the statement, as shown by the re-
port of the Secretary, for the two years, m a sum-
mary presenting the results of the Secretary's own
figures:

Error of the Secretary in underestimating
the excess of expenditure8, and under-sta-
tin? the amount of loan, as appearing hy
his report    1,132,845 30-
This amount, however, should }
be increased, as in the j
amount of "redemption off
treasury" notes above, is !
included notes under other [
acts, as by statement of the
Iipsjister of the Treasury, |
viz: 1,537,143 09
It thus appears that, deducting the receipts and
available means from the expenditures, there re-
mains on thdiist of July next an excess of expend-
itures over the receipts greater than the sum re-
ported by the Secretary by $1,132,845 30. This
amount is shown by the report of the Secretary;
and, in order to arrive at the result, I havs deduct-
ed from the statement of the expenditures during-
the last year and the first quarter of the present
fiscal year the amount of treasury notes said to
have been returned into the treasury, as .contained
in schedules A and B. But sine* the *last report
of thedepartment, the Register of the Treasury has
furnished what purports "to be a precise statement
of these treasury notes, (to which I shall have oc-
casion to refer, and to show that even that state-
ment is erroneous from the statement itself.) From
this statement it appears that there were embraced
in these two entries the sum of #404,298 70, which
was for expenditures in redemption of other loans
and interest. As this amount, therefore, should
not, in the view we have taken, have been deduct-
ed from the expenditures, of course the balance of
the excess of expenditures over receipts would be so
much greater—that in, §1,537,143 more than stated
by the Secretary, or provided for by the loan bill.
In the foregoing statement we have estimated the
precise avails of the loan at $33,000,000. The
small advance on a portion ofit would slightly vary
the result. It seems to me that nothing can be
