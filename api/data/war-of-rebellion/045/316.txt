General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your orders to Pleasonton and Meade, sent by signal, did not reach them, the signal officers having broken up their camps at Howard's, and the officer sent with them over to Howard's has brought them back here; so if you depended upon their receiving their orders by signal alone, it has failed. There was also a communication from General Ingalls to Pleasonton.
