treaty of Chicago, with various Ind.an tnbes, in
1832 The Committee of Ways and Means liad
given the subject a most rigid examination
Mr LOVE said he had given this subject a
most rigid examination also, and he was well con
vmeed that if the House was in possession of all
the facts, they would never adopt it He was
well convinced that frauds existed, (not on the part
of persons in Washington,) which should induce
its rejection The Indians had, to say the least
of it, made a good bargain, and they might wait
anothei year He would not vote for so large an
appropriation as a million and th rty odd thousand
dollars, brought forward for the first time on the
last day of the session Mr L then moved to
non concur with eo much of the Senate's amend-
ment as provided for the removal of the Indians
beyond the Mississippi
Mr POLK again explained, by making arefer-
ence to the vauous treaties The Committee of
Ways and Means had taken up each item sena'tm,
and compared it with the provisions of the tiea-
ties He was himself indisposed to recommend
so large a sum, but after a most careful examina-

Mr  EVAISS moved to amend the amendment
of the Senate, so as to provide that the appropria
Hon should not be "pphed unless a minster should
be first appointed by and with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, which was disagreed to
Mi   J  CI  ADAMS said this amendment  pio-
posed to introduce a new principle     The Presi-
dent had   hi'herto uniformly appointed   foreign
ministers of all grades, when he deemed such ap-
pointments necessary     This was a most import-
ant and necessary power reserved to him under
the Constitution     The amendment was an as-
sumption on the part of the Senate, thata minister
should not be appointed without the consent of
that body     This, if adopted, would Leone of the
mobt pernicious alterations which the Constitution
could endure     It was one among o her instances
of an at'empt to alter the Constitution in an ap-
propriation   bill      If this   punciple   should   be
adopted,  we should  have  other amendments of
the Constitution n troduced in a s milar wav , and
the President might be compelled in conseq lenco
to veto the general applanation bill     K was in-
cumbent upon the House to pi event any encioach
ments of the Executive upon the prerogatives of
the Senate     In   like manner, tie House  was
bound to resist the encroachments of ihe S°nate
i' upon the constitutional powers of the Executive
'I It was also the province of the Senate to check
I and contiol the action of this House, which was
quite as likely as the other branch, he would not
I say now, but in other times, to infringe upon the
!   lust lights of the Executive      The Constitution
provided three   powers,  who weie to cooperate
together in the management of the public aiiiirs
I Tiey formed checks upon each othei, and were
j so constituted that when one or the three attempted
' to   transcend  us constitution-!! sphere the other
two would interfere to prevent it
|     In conclusion Mr A   said, that the amendment
| of the Senate proposel  to lntioduc a punciple
, wnich was contrary to the pi a   K e of the Govern
I ment f om its corrmencement     Eveiy Pi evident,
| fiom Washington down, had pursued a different
1 piactice fiom   that pioposcd in  the amendment
It was true, the Senate did not assume dnectly to
| decíate t1 at a minister should not he- appointed by
I the Pi side>"t, unless pieviously confirmed bythat
body, but the means of such appointment were
withheld, and the Senate had deteimned not to
pay a minister unless appointed according to the
terms of then   proviso     He  hoped the House
would disagiee to the amendment of the Senate
Mr BAtlRINGER sa'd he was opposed to the
amendment of the Senate, and should vo e against
it     He be'ieved the Piesident had the power oí
appointment dunng the i ece^-s, where a vacancy
occuied  in that recess, and  he held that it made
little  d fference whether he wer  a ehaige   or a
minister    Tkie Piesident mightequally take upon
himself to inciease the pay, or to anpomt a mm
ister plenipotentiary instead of a charge, or vice
nm«, duung the recess    Mr B did not concur
with   the   geitleman from Massachusetts   [VIr
Adams]  n  his leasoning, although  he said he
should i or cui with him m the vote heintended to
give     He (Mr  B ) denied the right of the Presi-
dent of tie United States, upon former practice or
precedent, to appoint a ministei during the recess,
when the vacancy originated, or existed during the
-ession of thp Senate, rnd the President might
have nominated     He was aware tint it was a
contested question, as long ago as under the first
aJmimstration of tins Govemmen'   Butoneprac
tic  had been generally recognised, that of con
suiting with the S°iate whether they would ag'ee
t) institute diplomatic illations with any country
it vvvs so during the administration of Washing   I
ton and  the eldei Adams, even down to the time
ofMr  Jefferson      Ihe Piesident had never ¡ re-
sumed  until after th  administration of the last,
to open d'plomatic relations with a country with   ¡
out first advising with the Senate    Mr B said he
should vote for the appropriation                              |
T he ques'ion was then taken by yeas and nays,
and resulted as follows—yeas 114, nays 43
So the House cot cur-ed with the amendment of
the Committee of the Whole, and disagieed to
the Senate's amendment                                             ¡

The amendment re'ative to the Missouri land
claims having been read,
Mr R M JOHNSON renewed the amend-
ment he offered in Committee of the Whole
Mr C 4.VE JOHNSON hoped the House would
not agree to the onginai amendment, and that the
cla,ms should be referred to the Secretary of the
Treasury
Mi ASHLEY advocated the justice of these
claims II  believed theie were not more than
thieeorfcur that would not obtain a favorable
decision in the Supreme Court They had been
before the Secretary of the Tieasury ever since
last June, and he had íefused to ojudicate upon
them He denied that tnose claims were founded
on fraud
Mr MANN, of New York, was disposed to
place confidence in the chauman of the Cimmit-
teeon Private Land Claims-, [Mr Cave Johnson,]
and in the absence of more uirect information on
the sutject, he should vote against the amend-
ment
\ Mr PLUMMER hoped the House would not
give the amendment the go by, for it was a prop-
osition founded on justice, and ought to be
adopted
Mi HAMER thought these claims shou'd be
I confirmed
1 Mi CAVE JOHNSON aga'n spoke m opposi-
tion to the amendment The claims req ured more
investigation than if waspessibl  for the Secietary
of the Treasury to give them He knew the
grosses frauds and perjury would be found to exist
in i elation to a number o' these claims
Mr  WILLIAMS said it was impossible to go
I into a legal adjudication of cla.msat that late hour,
I and ti e better way would b' to let the subject he
ovei to anotner Congress
M- ASHLEY agvin advoca'ed the claims,ard
■ defended the charactei of the claimants
Mr WILLIAMS again expiessed a hope that
the subject should be left to a future session
Mr   POLK demanded the previous  question,
and exiphined that he did so fiom a wish to save
the bill, if possible
I     The previous question was seconded, and the
mam question ordered to be put
I     The question was then put, and the amendment
of the Senate was disagreed to, without a division
