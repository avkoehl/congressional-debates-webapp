Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., March 12, 1865.

SOLDIERS OF THE THIRD BRIGADE:

Circumstances make it necessary that, at least for a time, I must be separated from you. Before leaving allow me to thank you, officers and men, for the high soldiery bearing you have manifested since under my command. No more gallant, brave, and willing soldiers for the performance of every duty need any commander ever desire. Parting with old comrades and associates that I have been with upon so many trying occasions, who have never failed to obey all orders and discharge their whole duty to their country, is with me no small matter. Sons of Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana, and formerly in my command Ohio and Kentucky, have alike willingly vied with each other in the perils upon many bloody fields, seemingly to see which could most daringly be foremost in the fight and discharge most ardently their whole duty in the common cause for their Government. Many of them have been fallen heroes together, and await the final roll-call in the same tomb. From present indications the close of your dangerous toils and fatigues cannot be very distant if all perform well their part,
