FRANKFORT, KY., December 22, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

GENERAL: The New York Herald of the 12th instant contains what purports to be your report on the late operations of the armies of the United States.

I would most respectfully call the attention of the General-in-Chief to the following sentences contained in this report referring to the Army of the Cumberland:

Our right and part of the center had been completely broken, and fled in confusion from the field, carrying with them, toward Chattanooga, their commanders, Generals McCook and Crittenden, and also General Rosecrans, who was on the part of the line.
