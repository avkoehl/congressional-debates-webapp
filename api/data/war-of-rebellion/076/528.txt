HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 16, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

Have you any objections to putting Johnson in command of Louisville! I do not think he would like to serve in the Army of the Cumberland any longer, as he regards the placing of Davis in command of the corps as a personal insult.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Davis is here and is the bearer of a request from General Johnson to have command at Louisville or Nashville. I have telegraphed to General Schofield as to the former. He, General Johnson, came to see me yesterday on the same subject, but so many people were present that he did not have a chance to speak to me privately, and asked General Davis to see men, and General Davis is now here for that purpose. He says he thinks General Johnson would rather have a local command that none in the field.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

We will commence the movement against the railroad about Jonesborough Thursday night unless something occurs in the mean time to mar the plan. I will make my orders, and the preliminary preparations may be begun. If Wheeler interrupts our supplies, we can surely cut off those of Hood, and see who can stand it best.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.

(Same to Generals Schofield and Howard.)

Have you heard anything from General Garrard since he started out!

Have not heard anything. Will send down to his headquarters and see if they have any information from him.

Major- General.
