manufacturing; and third, the magnates of
this combination, comfortably seated at the
Astor or the Continental, figuring out, in the
language of the address, a uniform scale of
prices, and Congress is to be on duty on the
borders of the country to see that there are no
invasions by foreign manufacturers to disturb
the scale.
The proposition that Congress shall legis-
late to give the domestic manufacturers a
monopoly of the American markets is no less
than a proposition that Congress should join
with them and compel all the people in this
country to buy of these manufacturers, and
that, too, at their own prices. If this propo-
sition also embraced a requirement that they
should sell their wares to the people at cer-
tain prices, there would be a little equality in
it; and still more, if it contained a reciprocal
provision that while those engaged in agricul-
ture should be compelled to purchase of the
manufacturers on the scale of prices to be fixed
by their associations, they should be required
to purchase an equal amount of the farmers'
products at prices to be fixed by associations
of farmers.
now PKICES ARE DETEEJII3TED.
Legislation to create a monopoly of the
home market is unequal and unjust. It en-
ables the manufacturer to say what lie shall
have for his commodities, while it leaves the
-farmer to obtain what he can for his. When
a manufacturer sells an article, the process of
ascertaining how much shall he paid com-
mences first with the price established by him-
self, which is such as affords him a profit that
he deems adequate, and then there is to be
added all charges in making delivery. But
when the farmer is to make a sale, the process
is reversed ; it does not commence with liim,
but at the other end of the transaction. The
pricc in Now York is first ascertained, a price
over which he has no control, and then, sub-
tracting a sum sufficient to pay for transport-
ing the article' to that place, he receives what
is left. He is also, in the manner above stated,
made to bear the charges of the delivery of the
manufactured article he purchases as well as
the produce he sells—charges that are greatly
enhanced in consequence of increased cost of
building and running railroads and vessels,
resulting from present duties.
The farmer is compelled to sell his com-
modities on a level with the prices of the
world. The prices in New York are gauged
by those in Liverpool, where the produce from
the western prairies meets and competes with
like produce from France, Kussia, and all
parts of Europe. If there is any labor in
Europe which should be denominated pauper
labor, the farmers of this country are con-
stantly competing with it, and obtaining not
one penny more for their grain than the pau-
per-labor grain brings in the same market.
HOME MAKKETS.
It is said, keep up the duties and thus build
np manufactories and make a home market
for all the farm products. But these duties
prove to be obstacles in the way of sustaining
and enlarging the mechanical and manufac-
turing industries of the country. Several that
formerly were prosperous, among which may
be mentioned the important one of sbip-build-
ing, are destroyed by the present tariff.
The foreign market for the manufactures
of this country is also being lost. The cost
of articles made under this tariff is so great
they cannot be sold in other countries in com-
petition with foreign goods.
Were the manufacturers of this country
able to control the entire domestic market,
and were the manufacturing force sufficiently
increased to supply this market, there would
still remain a surplus of agricultural products
that must find a market in other countries.
The consumptive power of manufacturers and
their employes would need to be greatly en-
larged to enable them to consume all thebread-
stutfs and provisions that are annually exported;
and they must beeome very destructive of
clothing in order to use the cotton, to the
amount of more than fourteen hundred million
pounds, exported the last fiscal year.
The manufacturers are not able, under
present duties, to secure the home market.
The tariff proves to be a much more effective
barrier to keep our own fabrics from getting
out of the country, than to prevent foreign
coming in. By giving extra profits to all
classes of manufacturers under shelter of the
tariff, the result is not only that by the time
an article is completed its cost is so great it
cannot be sold abroad, but foreign manufac-
turers can import and sell in this country most
articles, with the duty added, at a price to
compete with our costly goods. Foreign sales
of American goods are being lost, while im-
portation of foreign is not prevented. The
tables of exports prove that instead of the tend-
ency being to enlarge the home market for
farmers' commodities, it is the other way, and
their exportation is increasing. In support
of the above positions some facts are given
from statistics of the Treasury Department:
Exports of the leading farm products for the fiscal years ending June 30,1870 and 1871, showing quantities and values.

By comparing the above with the table for
1870 and 1871, it will be seen that the farmers
are becoming still more dependent on foreign
markets, and their exports are increasing at a
rapid rate.
Let us see what the domestic manufacturers
are doing in tbe way of sustaining their sales
abroad. I take their exportation for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1800, under a low
tariff1, and for the year ending June 30, 1871,,
under a high tarilf:

It thus appears that in nearly all in-
stances the manufacturers are falling behind
in their foreign trade, and that the amount
in dollars of such sales is less with the
present high prices and in currency than it
was in 1860 in gold. How is it with domestic
trade?
