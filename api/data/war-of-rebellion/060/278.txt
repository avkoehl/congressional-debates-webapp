SIR: I have received communication that the enemy have attacked Plymouth in considerable force; thus far have been repulsed. their iron-clads have not yet come into action. I have directed General Peck to make such disposition of the forces in his district as best to repel this movement. I have taken from him a single cavalry regiment and a light battery. He must have 10,000 men under his command. Shall I do anything more?
