It is estimated that from the commencement of the rebellion up to June 30, 1865, there has been constructed and operated about 15,000 miles of U. S. military telegraph-land, submarine, and field lines.

From May 1, 1861, up to December 31, 1862, $22,000 per month sufficed to construct and maintain U. S. military telegraphs. For the year 1863 about $38,500 per month was required for the same purpose. During the year 1864 the military telegraph was greatly extended and required about $93,500 per month. From May 1, 1861, to June 30, 1865, $2,655,500 has been received by me from the U. S. Treasury, and disbursed or transferred by me for the construction, maintenance, and operation of U. S. military telegraphs.

Herewith please find statement of public moneys received during the year, and From A, embracing all the articles of property received by me during the same period. I have no occasion to use Forms D, C, CC, D, E, F, nor G.
