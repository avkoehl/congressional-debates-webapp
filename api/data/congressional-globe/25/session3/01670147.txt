THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
147
have been reported to the House of Representa-
tives at the present session, in answer to another
resolution, except as respects the old cases of
many yeais' standing, and which remain not very
materially alteied
3 The last part of the resolution requests " the
eoirespondenee touching defalcations of receivers
and collectors of the public money «unce the De-
partment furnished document No 297 "
This portion of the call is presumed to extend
only to the correspondence which is in my own
office, otherwise, a difficulty would exist m an-
swering it early, similar to that which occurred
in the document No 111, as it would require a
transcript of almost the whole records of the office
of the Solicitoi of the Treasury, during the period
specified, and which, though able to be given with-
out much delay in any particular case, might not, in
all cases on record, be completed seasonably The
present call may likewise be presumed to extend
to the correspondence in my own office, received
as well as sent, since the íequest is foi all " cor-
respondence touching defalcations "
But none of the letteis received, offering rea-
sons for megularities and delays in several in-
stances, were given in document No 297, because
that resolution was confined to " letters written
by" this Department Another difference is, that
the eoirespondenee now called foi and submitted
relates to defalcations alone, while the request in
document No 997 was for all the letters written
by the Department, as to " omissions to comply
with the laws and regulations established for their
government and other irregularities," as well as
defalcations It deserves notice that veiy little, if
any, of the eoirespondenee then or now submit
ted, relates to<ie/aicaiio)tsatt°rthey have been as
certained by the accounting officeis, or after they
appear on the appio] nate books, m thetr chaige
In that stage of the case, if let'ers aie written,
they are confined chiefly to the Comptrollei 'sand
Bohcitoi 's offices, where all def utlts art geneially
investigatt d and piosqeuted The reasons for any
preuous eoirespondenee aie bnefly these it some
times happens that, before defaults are legally as
certained on the books of the Comptroller, suspi-
cions are excited in the office of the Secietaiy of
the Treasurv, by letteis ieceived,oi other mfoim-
ation from third persons, or by delays and irreg-
ularities in complying with orders or legulations
of the Department These last happen weekly, if
not daily, m such a widespread country, paits
of it so new and remote as is much of ours, and
with such a vast number of officers connected with
the collection, keeping, and disbursing of gieat
amounts of public money It would, then, seem
prudent, or at least it is \igilant and useful, not
to wait foi the quaiteily settlements in the ac-
counting offices toascertun the fart whether a cul
pable default has happened oi not, but to cause
an ínqmiy into the subject, nifoimally, before
hand In such cast s, thetefore, this Dcpaitmi nt
has of late years, if not always, been in the habit
of immediately addressing letteis of inquiry and
of advice concerning informalities, niegulauties,
and any acts of a doubtful character Bv the íe-
phes obtained—sometimes qui k, though often
tardy, being from great distances, and some new
regions where the mails aie unfiequent, occasion
ally inegulai, and the retuins slower thin fiom
some foreign eountues—it has at times, befoie
the accounts weie quaiteily settled in the pioper
offices, succeeded in discoveimg wheihei a ieü
defalcation existed oi not, and whetlie i tl  money
aoparently due could not be obtained without the
expense  md delay of a suit
Not seldom, I owever, such co icspondence is
fiom necessity pi oti acted thiough sen ral months,
and then teiminates, sometimes in the removal
of all suspicion of wiong, sometimes is a satis
faetoiy payment of the money in doubt, some-
times in a correction of all niegulauties oi in-
formalities, and sometimes in a conviction that
there has been a willful default
Hence this practice has opeiated usefully It
is courteous, as would seem pioper, towaids
public officers not yet legallj shown to be in dc
fault, and it is conducive to the pub'ic security,
by leading, frequently, to moie prompt payments
Under a system of gieaterhatshness in ascertain-
ing defaults, by piesuming thur existence on
slighter giounds, and before tested by the quai
teily settlements, more lemovals fiom office, and
more fiequent suits, would take place, but they
would often prove to be undeserved, would oper-
ate at times oppressively, and add nothing to
eventual safety Nor could they in any íespect
be beneficial compared with that increased sever
lty m the law which has so fiequently been rec-
ommended, and is so desirable in a moral as well
as fiscal view, for punishing defaults after they
are cleaily ascertained
During these preliminary inquiries, it is cus-
tomary foi the Depaitment to keep the President
advised of their progress, so that if the con espond-
ence terminates unfavoiably, the officer found
guilty of a deliberate wrong, if not in the mean
time resigning, may be promptly removed by the
appointing power, without waiting for a defalca
tion to appear by the quartcily settlements The
President is in a habit of doing this when fully
satisfied that the default has been willful, and that
the money will not be paid over in conformity to
instructions, and without a suit and its accom-
panying cost and delays All the correspond
ence in such cases may be considered as " touch-
ing defalcations," and theiefoie in this report, as
well as in document No 297, has been given in
all cases where the supposed defalcations turned
out in the end to be real If in either instance
this has been doing moie than was necessaiv, it
was consideied better to furnish everything that
could possibly be embraced w ithin the resolution,
than to omit anything pertinent
But m neither instance has such correspond-
ence with " othei depositaries " been given,
though vei y extensive, with the deposit banks in
default, because othei depositaiíes are omitted to
be specified in this branch of the lesolution, which
they expressly enumerated in the first bianch
of it
Smei the document No 297, no correspondence
by this office with any collectoi, except the late
one at New York, and none with  any receiver, ,
except in  six  cases, has taken place wheie the '
p uty appealed, in tin end, to have been guilty of
a defalcation  to any amount whatevei      When
other cases of defalcations have been detected,]
they have been, as is customary, ascertained by |
the accounting officers at the legulai settlements, j
and  all communications concerning them have
been had with those officeis or the Solicitor     In I
some few instances, when doubt aiose, and the j
conespondence has, fiom abundant caution, been
instituted in this office before the quarterly settle
ments took place, it has resulted in satisfictoty
explanations   and no real defaleafion is known
or believed to have occuireil     In one case the
investigation   has   not yet terminated,   conse-
quently, copies of neither of these last aie sup-
posed tobe lequired under the present lesolution
Veiy íespectíully, youi obedient servant,

Helena Ameuca Vespucci, a young lady of Flor-
ence, descendant of the celebrated AmencusVes-
pucc.us, one of the íenowned navigators of the
fifteenth century,and whose name this continent
beais
Mr B said, this petition states the leason
which has induced, or rather constrained, this
young lady to leave her own country and to seek
an asylum in the United States, ital o states her
reasons for making the requests which the peti-
tion contains foi the rights of citizenship and a
giant of land He would pass the petition to the
table, and ask that it migh be lead by the Secre-
taiy
Ihe petition was tnen icad by the Secretary
Mr B said that the petition which had just
been lead, ot lathei translated by the Secietary,
foi it was in the French language, was entirely
the composition of the petitioner herself He had
seen it in the fiist draft, and had recommended
that nothing, in point of form even, should be
alteied, and that the petitioner should present her
own case in her own language It was not pre-
cisely in the style of petitions drawn up by our own
citizens, but what it lacked in parliamentary form
it might make up in the more essential qualities
ofpiecision and simplicity The young lady had
certainly piesented hei case delicately and power-
fully She touched with bievity and with feeling
the events and cmumstances which had thrown
her upon this continent, ind brought her to solicit
the aid of theCongiess of theUnited States Polit-
ic il leasons had caused hei to uithdiaw from her
own countiy, and in that íespect she stood on a
footing with otheis who had heietofore received
the fi lendly aid of this Government She did not
go into a detail of these political reasons—deli-
cacy of ft eling, and the bievity of a petition pre-
vei ting it, but they weie known to history, and
might be venfied bj those who should be charged
with the inquiiy She was the descendant of one
of those renowm d navigatois—old fathei man
neis, as she felicitously teims them—whose cour-
agi, skill, and enteipnse illustrated and illumin-
ated the fifteenth centuiy, and, in the course of a
few years, changed the face of the world She was
the descendant, and bore the name, of that one of
these patriarch tl man nets who christened the
¡New Woild with his own appellation,and caused
w¡ to be called Ami i cans She lnhents the blood
of th it Amencus Vcspue i is whose nami has
re&teel'ot thice oentuiicsund ihalf upon this quar
t( i of the ^lobi , and which will lemam upon it
foievei She do s not coll him the disroveier, but
the chiisienfi and baptisei of the New Woild
She is nowwithiut a countiy, without piOtec-
tion, with nit foitun nil she asks foi a comer
in that ¡and which beais the name of her family,
and foi th i iglit of citi/et ship among those who
weal the title of Ameucans
Mr B said it was due to the young lady her-
self, it would go fai towaids piosenting hei in a
piop i point of view before the Senate, that he
should say th it, befoie her amval in this city,
befoie he had seen her oi heaid anything fiom
