RICHMOND, February 28, 1865.

JOHN SCOTT:

General Maury is much in need of funds. Endeavor to sell 10,000 bales cotton with privilege of free exportation in any direction. Price 20 cents or more in specie or equivalent. Convert funds derived therefrom into Treasury notes and deposit with Guirot and Sanford to meet drafts of disbursing officers. If such sale cannot be made, and it becomes necessary sell for Treasury notes at market rates without privilege of exportation. Consult with Clapp.

G. A. TRENHOLM,

Secretary Treasury.

Colonel E. SURGET,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of Ala., Miss., and East La., Meridian, Miss.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to send inclosed a statement of negroes in this district, for the information of the lieutenant-general commanding. Also a statement of engineer implements likely to be needed in a siege. By putting the tools now in the hands of negroes into the hands of troops I can send 200 negroes to Choctaw and Oven Bluffs, but would much prefer not to do so until the last moment. The negroes at Enterprise Captain Morris can dispose of as the lieutenant-general may see fit. They might go to the bluffs if they can be furnished with tools from any other source. The work at Choctaw and Ove Bluffs has been much retarded by bad weather and extreme high water. Ten rafts were reported on 1st of the month s requiring but slight work to finish them. The water has risen over the banks upon which they were being made, and has almost entirely stopped works. One is finished, two more nearly complete, and seven more framed, but in the water, and the principal labor has been to keep them from floating off. I would like to keep at least 200 or 300 negroes here for siege labor in engineer service. The other departments might dispense with many that are now in their employ.

I am colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. H. LOCKETT,

Colonel and Chief Engineer, Department of Alabama, &amp;c.
