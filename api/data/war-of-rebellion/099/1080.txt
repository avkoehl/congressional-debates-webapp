HEADQUAETERS HUME'S DIVISION CAVALRY,

February 2, 1865.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: The enemy are now in one mile of our headquarters. General Humes moved early this morning to the Salkehatchie road to meet the enemy. He left only one regiment (Fith Tennessee) here. We cannot stop the enemy long. General Humes ordered the bridges destroyed across Salkehatchie Swamp. This will be done, if possible. The enemy are pressing very hard. I sent General Humes a courier informing him that he could not return by way of his old headquarters. His wagon trains are moving toward Duck Branch Post-Office. I thought proper to inform you of this.

Very respectfully, lieutenant, your obedient servant,

CHAS. A. ELDER,
