Bvt. Major General M. D. LEGGETT,

Commanding Third Division, Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I expect to leave to-morrow for Washington City, and will rejoin the corps upon its arrival at Alexandria, and in my absence you will assume the command. I will see you in the morning before I leave. I wish you to take command as soon as the corps goes into camp to-morrow evening. If there are any promotions you wish made in your division by way of compliment to officers who have served faithfully and well, I will charge myself with the duty of presenting attention. I have the papers which General Howard gave recommending the appointment of your son to a cadetship at West Point, and upon which I have procured the indorsement of Schofield, Slocum, and Sherman. I will present this personally to the President, and do what I can to secure the appointment.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant Colonel A. HICKENLOOPER,

Assistant Inspector-General, Seventeenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: The general wishes me to say to you that he does not wish to have a formal review of yourcorps to-morrow. The general will be stationed near the Jarratt Hotel, and he desires to have the troops march by him by the flank, with colors flying and bands playing, and simply come to a shoulder arms by regiments as they pass. Let the troops move through the city at a right shoulder shift. I think they make a better appearance.

Very respectfully,

WM. E. STRONG,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
