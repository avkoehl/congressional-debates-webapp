In the report, to the President they state they
liave laid 762,903 yards at $3 oO, equal to
$2,670,160, an excess of almost $2,000,000
over the appropriation. The species of work
was iu all cases set out in the plau, which con-
tained separate columns for that purpose, and
where there was a pavement to be laid its kind
was specified. In the matter of concrete pave-
ments the disregard of law is still more flagrant,
for there is no concrete whatever provided for
under the act of the Legislature, actually no
column for it in the " comprehensive plan,"
and yet they have laid sixteen miles of it
according to their own report. This is a
monstrous assumption of power and abuse of
trust. An attempt is made to justify it under
the report of a board of engineers which iu a
qualified way indorses concrete against the ex-
perience of every city in the United States.
But. who gave any body of such experts author-
ity to change an act of the Assembly, or make
legal what was otherwise prohibited? That
report, however, will do t.hem little good ; it
eomcs at once too soon and too late. It is
dated May 15, 1872, before which time they
had been laying concrete extensively, and
since which time they liave laid wooden pave-
ments. That report condemns wooden pave-
ments ; and if it is to be authority, no more
woodet) ones should be used, and yet two con-
tracts for them have been entered into since
November 1, 1872, as appears by the sup-
plementary statement made to the Committee
lor the District of Columbia by the Board of
Works, that for Second and Third streets east,
November lfi, Phillip's wooden pavement,
§10,310, and November 18, De Golyer wooden
pavement, $33,250.
The fact is, as was proved in the investiga-
tion last year, that concrete pavement laid as
it is here only costs about seventy cents a yard,
leaving a clear profit for somebody of $2 50.
That it is utterly worthless needs no board of
experts to prove. A man with a stout pair of
boots could with them alone dig up half the
concrete pavement iu Washington before he
wore the heels off. The model piece in front
of the Arlington Hotel, which was laid at
great expense, and by its endurance brought
so much evil on the city, has been extended
by the same partiee through Scott square under
the authority of the Board of Works, but so
badly that on a dry day it is like a country
road, and the foul and injurious dust is what
would be popularly called aukle deep. In
windy weather this dust, driven into the houses,
will ruin everything it touches ; it will fill cur-
tains, carpets, and furniture; and then melting
under the heat of fires, will run like tar, and
defile whatever may come in contact with it.
As for wooden pavements, the Board of Works
have themselves given their opinion about
them in their notes to their original compre-
hensive plan, as follows:
"The board is satisfied,upon careful consideration,
that as a rule the value of property m the District
will not warrant the general introduction ot wood
or other expensive pavements, and that, if at all
used they should be confined to a few of the princi-
pal avenues of communication. It is believed that
road-beds of stone, more duraole and equally tree
ironi dust and mud, can be constructed at less cost
than has usually been paid for the most ordinary
kind of stone pavements."
In disposing of this subject I warn residents
in this District not to be deceived by appear-
ances; nothing is more beautiful than a con-
crete plaster when first put down. It is as
handsome as a mustard-plaster, and both are
about equally nasty when they have been
applied for a short lime. The improvements
made by the board are like life: '' life is all a
fleeting show,'' and so arc they. In two years
every concrete abomination will have returned
to dust, and in two more the wooden affairs
will have resolved themselves into typhoid
fever.
The Delegate from the District has stated
in his speech that the certificates of assess-
ment have been tested before the supreme
court of this District and pronounced valid.
Iu this he is mistaken. Actions were com-
menced by property-holders for injunctions,
and the court merely decided that these suits
were premature andunnecessary,on theground
that there was a good defense at law if an
attempt should be made to enforce them.
Had the gentleman been a lawyer he would
have beeu acquainted with the familiar rule of
practice, that no application can be made to
the equity side of a court where there is a legal
defense which is broad enough to cover the
requirements of the case. Otherwise a pers,on,
instead of defending a suit on a note, might
ask the court to enjoin the holder from suing
it, and thus practically do away with legal
jurisdiction. So far from these certificates
being held valid, it was strongly intimated in
the opinion of the court, if I am not mistaken,
that they were void; and such would certainly
bo the opinion of lawyers generally.
I cannot follow the gentleman through all
his other vagaries of assertion, and point out
his omissions or mistakes ; as where he quotes
the opinion of Mr. Blair in favor of improve-
ments, but does not add that Mr. Blair stated
he expected the improvements to cost $30,-
000,000; or where he says that the taxes have
not been increased, but does not add that they
never are, so long as a city is borrowing money
and can pay its interest from its principal. As
an evidence of the expenses of the District
government, I will, however, quote a table
from a speech made by me last year which
settles the matter of economical administra-
tion :

He has introduced into his speech a most
outrageous and uncalled for attack on a gen-
tleman ill this city who has given me some
assistance, and to whom I am and the District
ought to bo obliged for it, and I now speak in
order to defend him as a matter of justice.
He has stated that Mr. Crane was accused in
a criminal trial in court of being unworthy of
belief, and that a number of witnesses were
called to testily to this fact. That is true, but
is it Hie whole truth? On the contrary, is
it not a clear case of what lawyers cab sup-
pressio writ It is true, some dozen of wit-
nesses were called from among the followers
of the Board of Public Works or contractors,
who had been denounced by him for fraudu-
lent practices when he was in official position,
who said they would not believe him under
oath. He did not add, however, that this so-
called criminal trial was a prosecution insti-
tuted by Mr. Crane for libel, and that when his
character was attacked he summoned eighty-
five of the leading gentlemen of this city,
every one of whom testified to his character
as being above reproach. Among these were
Mayor Wallach, Mayor Emery, George \V.
Biggs, John D. Blake, and other gentlemen
of the highest standing, who sustained him
so strongly, that before he got through with
calling them as witnesses the judge stopped
him, and told him it was no longer necessary.
Bear in mind that this reflection is made on
an honest man by the Board of Works. See
how they strike at him because he opposed their
operations. Judge, then, why I do not, receive
more public assistance from residents in this
District. Yet 1 assure you residents came to
meprivatcly, enough of them ; not Democrats,
but Republicans, nine out of ten of them, for
I have always said fraud was no question of
party ; not whites alone, but very often negroes;
especially men of no great wealth, who seethe
certainty of the property they have accumu-
lated passing out of their hands into the hands
of this grasping Board of Public Works.
Shall I desert these men ? Shall I sit silent
as a member of a committee before which such
things come and allow them to go on without
my protest? It is true my constituents are
not robbed, but they are largely of Irish and
German birth or descent, and I can answer for
the generous sympathy of the Irish heart and
the strong Teutonic hatred of dishonesty, that
they will thank me for my efforts almost as
much as though they had been made in their
behalf. To show how downtrodden and intim-
idated the citizens of Washington are, I will
read a letter 1 have just received:
Washington, February 10, 1873.
DkauSir: As a taxpayer of this District I have
been much interested in the discussions in thellou^c
of Representatives in regrard to the expenditures of
the Board of Public Works of thiJ Disi lief, and hav-
ing accidentally got hold of a leaf of a, pamphlet
winch I suppose to he p,<rt of the reportof theBoard
of Public Works to Congress at tlio first of the pres-
ent session, T thought I would call your attention
to what seems to mo very strange items m the " ex-
penditures ot James A. Mugruder." This leaf being
pages 63 and 61. On page 63, dated, I believe, Octo-
ber 15,1872. (this is page 159 of tbc report of the Board
ot Public Works,) was the following item : ' lo 
Buckley, S streei south, from First to Seventh streets
wt\st, £1,300." Now, a glance . t any map of the cuy
will show you that S street south does not exist be-
yond Four-and-a-half street on the west, and as the
arsenal wall comes up to P street, all of S street wcot
of the James Creek canal is three souarcs within the
