mitted the following resolution:
Unsolved, That the Committee on Commerce he
directed to inquire in-to the causes which have pro-
duced the present depression of tho shipping inter-
ests of the United States, aud whether our maritime
interests do notrequirca remission of internal duties
on the materials entering into the building of vessels,
or some legislation to facilitate the transfer of foreign
vessels to American owners, and to report by bill or
otherwise.
Mr. GARFIELD. I would ask the gentle-
man to include in his resolution an inquiry
whether a resumption of specie payment would
not be valuable to the interests of commerce.
. Mr. ELIOT. No, sir.
The resolution was adopted.
ZEPIIANIAU KNAPP.
Mr. WOODWARD, by unanimoas consent,
introduced a bill for the relief of Zephaniah
Kuapp, of Pittston, Luzerne county, Pennsyl-
vania ; which was read a first and second time,
and referred to the Committee on Revolution-
ary Pensions and of the War of 1812.
AUDITOR OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
, Mr. BEAMAN. I ask unanimous consent
to offer the following resolution:
Resolved, That tho Committee on Agriculture be
instructed to inquire into the expediency of creating
an officer, to bo denominated the auditor of the de-
partment of agriculture, whoso duty it shnll be to
pass upon ail accounts' of and claims against said
Department, and to report by bill or otherwise.
Mr. HOLMAN. I object, and call for the
regular order of business.
PUBLICATION OF POSTAL CONVENTIONS.
Mr. LAFLIN, from the Committee on Print-
ing, reported a joint resolution in regard to the
publication of postal conventions made with
foreign Governments; which was read a first
and second time. The joint resolution author-
izes and directs the Secretary of State to cause
the several postal conventions made with for-
eign Governments, under the provisions of
the act of March 3, 1851, or which may here-
after be made, to be published in the same
mantier and upon the same terms as is pre-
scribed for the publication of the treaties and
. laws of the United States.
Mr. MAYNARD. I would like to inqnire
of the chairman of the Committee on Printing
[Mr- Laflin] whether it is contemplated by
this joint resolution that these postal conven-
tions shall be printed in the " Statutes-at-
Large," now published by Little & Brown?
Mr. LAFLIN. The intention of this reso-
lution is to .provide an omission in the act of
March 9, 18(57. That act simply provided for
the publication of the treaties and laws of the
United States. By a decision of the proper
authorities these portal conventions do not come
under the head of treaties. It is deemed de-
sirable by the Post Office Department that a
special enactment should be made by Congress
authorizing the publication of these postal con-
ventions. It is proposed to have them pub-
lished in the same way and by the same author-
ity that our treaties and laws are to be published.
No power is given to any one that he does not
now possess in relation to the publication of
; treaties and laws. I do not see how any one
can object to it.
1 Mr. BANKS. Will the gentleman allow me
i to make a statement?
Mr. LAFLIN. Certainly.
Mr. BANKS. I desire to say that the Post
. Office Department has entered into an agree-
ment or sort of treaty with the North German
Union, Swiss Confederation, and colonial gov-
ernment of Hong Kong, to carry letters at a
freight charge of five cents instead of fifteen
cents as formerly. There is no authority to
. publish these postal conventions, because they
are neither treaties nor laws. They cannot
therefore be published by the Stiite Depart-
ment. No additional appropriation is neces-
sary. All that is required is authority to make
the formal publication. I trust the resolution
will pass.
The joint resolution was then read the third
time, end pass'&d.
Mr. LAFLIN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the joint resolution was passed ; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
i laid on the table.
| The latter motion was agreed to.
LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
Mr. BUCKLAND asked and obtained in-
definite leave of absence for his colleague, Mr.
Hamilton, on account of sickness.
ORLAF E. DREUTZER.
Mr. MYERS, from the Committee on For-
eign Affairs, reported back, with a recommend-
ation that the same do pass, Senate bill No. 80,
for the relief of Orlaf E. Druetzer, late consul
of the United States to the kingdom of Norway.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be read a third time.
The bill was read at length. It directs the
Secretary of the Treasury to pay to Orlaf E.
Dreutzer, late consul at Bergen, the sum of
$837 47 in coib, for consular salary from No-
vember 4, 1865, to May 24, 186(5, less the
amount of consular fees received by him dur-
ing that time.
Mr. MYERS. I ask that the report accom-
panying the bill be read.
Mr. HOLMAN. As this bill proposes to
make an appropriation, I reserve the right to
make the point of order on it that it must first
be considered in Committee of the Whole.
The report was read.
Mr. HOLMAN. I raise the point of order
that this is an appropriation bill, and must first
be considered in Committee of the Whole.
The bill was accordingly referred to the
Committee of the Whole, and placed on the
Private Calendar.
