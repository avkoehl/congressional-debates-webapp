THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 17,
property, and that Congress cannot take from the j
Executive the control of the public money Is this
the possession of the public purse, or is it not?
Gentlemen heie admitted,on thedepositequestion,
that Congress had the control of the public moneys,
but now the Presiden' tells us that the Constitu-
tion gives him the possession and control of them
And with all this, what further ? «Why, the gen-
tleman fiom Mississippi said that the Piesident
had no power to send such a message to Congress
But the gentleman did not observe that this power
was claimed in a part of the Constitution never
before claimed by any other President, to wit his
oath of office He gives this as the foundation
from which he derives his power, and claims it to
be his duty to seethe Constitution p eserved invi-
olate He says the Senate has violated the Con-
stitution, and that it is hisduty to go to theSenate
and correct that violation With the sword and
the purse in his hand, and his oath to see that the
Constitution is not violated, where is the bmit of
h s power' And he is to sustain the Constitution,
under his oath of office, as he understands it not
as the judicary may expound it, or as Congress
may declaie it, but as he indiwdually undeistands
it And because theSenate have passed a resolu-
tion expiessive of then opinion, he says that it is
a violation of the Constitution and actmejjudieially,
and that he cannot be touched but by impeach-
ment Impeachment of 'ne Executive with all the
powers he claims' The expression of opinion by
the Senate the Piesident tianslates into ajudicial I
sentence, passed without tml, and yet the same
President has passed the same opinion on the :
Senate, and we have not heard that this is uncon-1
stitutional In the execu'ive message sent to the
Senate in March, 1832, he says thai, the Senate
have acted unconstitutionally, and yet the Senate
can do no act restiainmg his power We cannot
say he has used the money of the neople Ouis
is only a judicial powei Is not the document
saturated thioughout with denunciations of the
Seriate, charging this body with having violated i
the Constitution? And now it is a matter of gie-
vious compLint that the Senate have dared to
express similar opinions I he resolution offeied
by Mi Bianch, of Noith Ciiohna, when a Sen-
ator here, \v¡ s not complained of as an unconfti-
tutional exeici^e of power, and yet the lesolution
of the gentleman fiom Kentiuky is compHined of
as an unconstitutional lesolution, because it is not
jojnt,and not intended as the foundation of legisla
uve action how did the Presidentknow that it was
not intended as the foutdation of the bill foi the
lestoiation of the dej osites? Yet, he as^unes it, I
ami says the Senate cmnot pass the resolution i
Ihe pieamble decíales that it is asseited, lest it
should b°drfv nit to p.ectdent, and was ¡t not the
duty of the Senate to declare it, to pi event a silent
acquiescence
Mr S said he might cite the resolution relative
to the Seminole war, and the lcsolu ion in the
House oí Reoresenta'ivcs lelative to the P^nan a
mission, but it wasunnecessaiy There was o e
thing, however, upon which he wou'd ray a word
The Piesident had seen fit to set fouith in this
document ceitun legislative proceedings, for the
purpose of having a bearing on ceitain individual
members of the Senate, end he had dona him (Mr
"5 ) the honor to refer to lusvoteon the passage of
the resolutions, and then detailed the lesoluaons
of the Lt-'islatuie of M n t
;iv ng
him
tions on that sub]ect Now, all tlm he (Mi S)
need siy to the tenant of the White House was,
that if the Sfretary of the 1 rea=> u y was his Sec
relary, he (Mi S ) was not las Senator He
reeognsed nj right in Ihe President to lecture hin
upon Hs duty as a Senate i heie Whatever power
lie might have ovei /us offueis and men, aid the
cm ers of /as Givernmei t, ne was not his cfiirei,
and so long as the Government was cor fided to him
to theex cntof the pu the took m if, it she ild not
be ftis Government Mr S said he recognised i o
right in the Piesident to say whether he shoakl ac'
in aceoidance with his will or otherwise In his
spirit of dif union, what had we h «aid ? Membeis
had sail they wete elected as Jacksonmen, and
tleiefore tl ey had no discretion but to vote as
J icbsonirei He was not so situated He owed
no fealty to Piesident Jackson he was not elected
as a Jaeksonman He submitted to no control of
his—he never bowed the knee to Baal     He was
elected to act on his convictions of doty, upon
mature deliberation, upon such sul jects as should
come before him He never would acknowledge
the right of the Executive, or of any individual, to
dictate to him, or to rebuke Senators here He
was aware there was a disclaimei accompanying
this part of the document, that he said he gave it
only as a matter of history, and he was the mere
historian But he might have given something
more interesting, for this had been nothing more
than what was in the official journal for the last
three months
The President closes this paper by an appeal to
his own services in behalf of the people, the same
process by which the peoplfc have Leen called on
in all ages to confer unlimited power He points
to his wounds, to his past sei vice-, and appeals to
the people if they can refuse anything to sucn a
benefactor And how (Mr S asked) is " mi/
Government" now felt 1 ke the dews of heaven ?
Look abroad through the land, cast your eyes
over the countiy, behoid youi green fields with-
ued, listen to the cries of distiess of the widow
end the orphan, rising almost in execiations of
the exercise of that power which has blasted their
hopes and reduced them to despair *• And yet,
^ays this document, Government is only to be
1 nown as the dews of heaven in its opeiations
Such is the moial—such is the example
Mr rRELl^ulIUVSEN considered this asa
most ext aordmaiy proceeding—one which would
•oim an era in Amencan his'oiy When th° busy
hum of industry was s lenced, when tne laboiei
was in v ant of employment, when banks weie
bieakiog in every diieotiori, and thecneu foi lehef
from the w leleiiting hand of power were heaul
evei ywheie around us, what did we see befe re us ?
A lecture of an houi and a 1 alf to the Senate foi
dating to mtet'eie with the Evecutive power and
-uthonty—an mteifeience which, he says, has a
duect tendency to interiupt the haimony which
should subsist between the vinous c^oiJinate
branches of the Government He charges us with
having nscnbed to him encioachmeii's upon the
Cinstitution, and yet in eveiy sucessive page he
has charged th" Senate with the same thing And
now (Mr I' thought) ouroi ly coui e to pieseive
that harmony was, to letuse to rei eive tl e paper
He viewed tus is n unauthoi ?ed Executive m
teiference witn the'egiditive action of the Senate
The Piesident allies, th t these reso'utions lead
to no legisla ion How does no know this? Why
does he oijectuie what maj or may not be tl e
ac'ion of Con°'iess ? We allege nhf t the Secietary
ot theTi asuiy wasresoonsible to Congiess, that
if he íemoved the deposites, he was bound to
lepoit his leasons to Cong ess ¥/ell, he did
lemove them, ai d g ive his i caso is for the act, and
o i theirvtiy face it appears that tl e Secietary was
irduced to do the act by tne order of the Presi
dent, and vnui the act íe ers him over to Con
gress and we find that the Secretary may found
himself on his own reasons or the exec it ve
oiders, have we no light to expiess oui opinion,
and s-y that the Executive had noauthonty,orthat
the íe sons aie insufficient? PheHou^eof Repre-
sentatives lit d not come up to the qu°st on vh° her
the leasons for the removalof tl e deposites were
suffi lent and satisfactory, and what do we now
find I it Piesident inteifermg between us and
oui f„tuie legislation He fo mds him elf on 1 is
powei of removal, ind while he leases himself on
foity yeais con tructior, hp forgets trie courtry's
expcnence fo forty yeais of the neets ity and
u ihty of the Dank of 'he ün ted Sti es The legis-
lative eon^equenc s of our action were direct and
immediate, 'or until Congiess appiovtd of the

Gut Ml r maintained that we hadangnt to

popu'anty to destioy the liberties of the people,
we have a right to -ay tl at tne Piesideitis on the
way to it, mil if those liberties «i e not i e«cueJ by
the ballot boxes they will mevitil ly be lost He
could not consent to lece ve thi papci if fir this
leason alone The allusion to the resolutions of
the Legislature of I\ew Jeisey were nwoithy of
the Cmef Mag strate of this gieat nat on as the
chromclei of the times     And if four Senators here
have dared to meet the fiowns of 'hen constituents
in their zeal for their countiy and the love of hb-
eity by voting against these usurpations of execu-
tive power, it was some ev dence of the existence
of these evils He did not bow his knee to these
msti actions, and he appealed to tne great Judge of
all tnmgs for the honesty and upnghuiess of his
intentions He had but one word to say of these
instructions Thepeooleof New Jersey have their
servants at home, and they have their seivanta
here, and they have distinctly said that they con-
sidei it puie arrogance in their servants at home to
dictate to their seivants heie
Mr BEATON lose and said that the public
mind was now to be occup'ed with a question of
the verv fust moment and impoitance,and identi-
cal in all its features with the gieat question glow-
ing out of the famous resolutions of the Engl sh
House of Commons in the case of the Middlesex
election in the year 1768, and which engrossed the
attention of the Bntish empire for fouiteen years
befort it was settled That quest on was one m
which the Plouse of Commons was judged and
condemned, foi adopting a resolution which was
hele' by the subjects of the British Crown to be a
' violation of their Constitution, and a subveision
rf the lights of Englishmen Ihe question now
before the Senate, and which will go before the
Aneiican people, g-ows out of a resolution in
w! ícli lie (Mr B ) believed that the Conni'ution
had been violated—the privileges of the House of
Representatives mvaJ d—and the lights of an
American cit z=n, in the person of the Presiden',
ubverted Ihe resolution of the House of Com-
mons, after fourteen yeersof annual motions, was
expunged from tne journal of the House, and he
fledged himself to the American people to com-
mei es a sitmlai series of motions with respect to
th s resolution of tne Senat  He had made up
hie mind to do so without consuliation with any
h mun being, and without deigning to calculate
the el anees, or the time of success     He tested
i  under the firm conviction that the resolution of
the Senate, which had diawn from the President
I    tne calm, temperate, and  d gmfied Piotest which
1 ad been read it the talle, \ as a resolution which
I ought tobe expunged fiom the louinal of theSen-
ate aid if anjtnmg was neces aiy to stimulate
his sense of dufy in making i n otion to that effect,
a Hi m encouiagmg others aftei   he was gone, m
II  fil owing up that motion to success, it would be
| found in tne hptoiy and termination of the simi-
I   lai motion which was made in the English House
of Commons to which he had referied Tnatmo-
| Hon was tenewed for fourteen years—-fiom 17b8
to ]782—befoieitwas successful For the first
seven years the lofty and md gnant raajonty d d
1 not condescend to reply to the motion Ihey
■ sunk it under a dead vo'e as often as presented
The second seven yeais they reohed, and at the
end of the term, and on the assembling of a new
i Par'iament, the veteian motion was carried by
more than two to one and the gratifying spec'aele
was beheld of a public expurgation, in the face
of the assembled Commons of England, of the
obnoxious resolution fiom the journal of the
House The el^c ions in England v/eie septen-
nial,and if took two teims of seven years, oi t*o
genen ['elections, to br ng the sen«e of the king-
dom to bear upon then representatives, the elec-
tions of the Senate were sexem ml, with inter-
calary exits and entrances, and it might take a less,
oi a longer pcnod, 1 e would not presume to say
which, to bring the sense of the American people
'o beai upon an act of the Amencan Sena'e Of
tiiat, he wiu'd make no calculation, but the final
succesiof tie motion in the English House of
Commnn„, a iter fouiteen years'perseverance, was
a si fficient encouragement for him to begin, and
doubtless would encouiage others to continue,
until tne good work "iiould be crowned with suc-
cess, a d the only atonement made, which it was1
m th  Senate's power to make, to the violat J
rn |esty of thtConsti ution, the invaded privileges
of the House of Representatives, and the subverted
rights of an American citizen
in bnngingthis great question before the Ameri-
can people, Mi B should consider himself 09
addieosmg the calm intelligence of an enlightened
community He behevd the body of the Ameri-
can people to be the most enlightened community
upon eaith, and, without the least disparagement
