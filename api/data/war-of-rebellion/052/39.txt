Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD:

The following telegram has just been received from General Lytle at Bridgeport:

BRIDGEPORT, August 15, 1863-7.30 p.m.

The rebels have been very busy this afternoon. Just before dark we discovered what may be working parties, with three wagons, on edge of timber at 1 8/8 miles from our batteries; could not make out their purpose with our glasses. If erecting works, they must have brought down a siege piece or two on train this morning.

Dispatch from old Kelley, brought by negroes, reports rebel cavalry to-day 4 or 5 miles east of Jasper. Kelley says 200 or 300. Information so indefinite I hesitate to send out, say without orders from yourself. Rebels may be too strong for Second Tennessee. Large bivouacs this evening at locality of supposed working party.

W. H. LYTLE,

Brigadier-General.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WINCHESTER, August 15, 1863.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Stevenson:

Tell General Lytle to have the fires counted and watched to see if they are not a humbug. Have you anything to confirm your suspicions of last night as to enemy's leaving.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

General J. A. GARFIELD:
