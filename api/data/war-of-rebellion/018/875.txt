HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., April 29, 1862.

Major General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding Department, &amp;c., Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Lee to say that there is an urgent demand for more light artillery for service with the army in advance near Fredericksburg, and to ask if you cannot spare Captain Thornton's, Captain Latham's, or some other battery from your department? He hopes that by this time some of the artillery companies in South Carolina which were without batteries when he left the department have obtained their pieces, and that you will have it in your power to forward one or more of the Virginia companies for the above mentioned purpose.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Major General THOMAS J. JACKSON,

Swift Run Gap, Va.:

GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your letter of yesterday's date. From the reports entitled to credit that have reached me the force of the enemy opposite Fredericksburg is too large to admit of a reduction of our army in that quarter. By so doing it would not only open an attack upon Richmond, but might jeopardize the safety of the army in the Peninsula by threatening its rear. I very much retreat my inability to send you the re-enforcements you desire and which might enable you to make an advantageous movement. Unless a sufficient force can be obtained by a union of the commands of Generals Banks, I think you would at least be able to disperse such troops as may be in the vicinity of Warrenton. Should, however, the enemy have evacuated that region, them a portion of General Ewell's force could be detached to Fredericksburg, where he might be able to strike a successful blow at the enemy still north of the Rappahannock. It may be necessary to detach General Ewell with one of his brigades in any event from his present position and assign him to the command of the troops in the Aquia District. The enemy seems to have concentrated his forces on his two flanks, leaving his center open, and we shall have to do the same to oppose him. Please inform me whether General Ewell, with one of his brigades, can be spared for this service. you could hold the upper country against Banks.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Brigadier General JOSEPH R. ANDERSON, Fredericksburg, Va.:

GENERAL: Your report of to-day of the enemy's movements I think indicates an intention to withdraw from his position at Chatham. If
