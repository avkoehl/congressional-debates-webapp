WHEELING, December 22, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have information from Colonel Higgins, at New Creek, that Rasser with 3,000 cavalry left Petersburg on the 20th instant by way of Northwestern Virginia turnpike in the direction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, in Preston County; supposed to be advancing upon Grafton and the western part of this State.

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.

CUMBERLAND, December 22, 1864.

Major General GEORGE CROOK,

Comdg. Dept. and Army of West Virginia, Kernstown, Va.:

The following is telegraphed by Colonel Higgins from New Creek to Captain Melvin, assistant adjutant-general:

Rosser, White, Woodson, and McNeill, with 3,000 cavalry, moved from Petersburg, at 11 a. m. 20th instant, in the direction of West Union. Henry Bokre, scout of First Illinois Light Artillery, reports having seen the columns pass, counted the number from off the mountain. No artillery.

JAC. HIGGINS,

Colonel, Commanding.

The West Union spoken of in this dispatch is in Preston County. They are probably moving toward Rowlesburg, if this be true. I will telegraph any further information. Rosser has undoubtedly been in that section of the country foraging for several days.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WHEELING, W. VA., December 22, 1864. (Received 4 p. m.)

Colonel HIGGINS,

New Creek:

Have you any further news of the enemy? When did the scout see the column? Put your post in the best possible state of defense; you may be attacked.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

POST HEADQUARTERS, New Creek, W. Va., December 22, 1864-6 p. m.

Brevet Major-General KELLEY,

Wheeling, W. Va.:

No later news for the enemy. The point at which they were seen passing was one mile and a half from Petersburg on the Seneca Gap road. I now have scouts out and expect news hourly.

JAC. HIGGINS,

Colonel, Commanding.
