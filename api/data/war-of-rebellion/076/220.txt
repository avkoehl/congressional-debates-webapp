Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

Brigadier-General Garrard's cavalry is ordered on an expedition by Major-General Sherman which will occupy them at least two days. This will leave Decatur defenseless, and the way open for a small body of the enemy's cavalry to dash into our rear. You will therefor send one brigade of Fuller's division to occupy the place, and to picket strongly the roads to the south and east until the return of the cavalry. You will also have your pioneer companies open a road through to General Schofield's position in rear of our present line so that we can communicate quickly if necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
