upon the man who would skulk from the
defence of his country when it was m danger
The fiaaocratio party, however, knew too well on
whose shoulders the defence of the country would
fail, should a war ensue
He understood the gentleman from New York
[Mr. Hontj 10 say tfeat President Van Bctren was
justly ch&rgtable with the burning of t v> Caroline,
and all the misfortunes which arose ou of it He
understood Mm spec fically to charge that the Pre-
sident, for his own base political purpose , and
with the view of obtaining the vote ct New York
for his own tnends, had forborne to issue his pro-
Uamat on of neutrality until it was 'oo late to pre-
vent mischief, and that if he had issu-d it, it
would have prevented those occurrences which led
to the burning of the Caro'me Now, sir, let me
tell the gentli it an that he is paying hi-, own no-
ble ¡ante a very shabbv compliment, when he tells
us" that hfr f>w nn be won by such unworthy
mean . I>! íne ai o tell him that precisely a di'
fer^nt charge was, a ide against Mr Van Bureri
duung the same time by members on this floor,
for ejtt-catittg the lavis with too much rig r. He
would ask, however, if Mr Van Brucn was at
thibpemd <o hard puvacdl He wouui if-k if his

whtdi that patty was composed when i irramphed
at the late election, was still m i's on • u-1 c laos
Tn« Northern Abolitionist and the Sot to. slave-
holder had not yet been drilled to pull m the sama
harness toj<e the"-, and the shreds and pa ches of
vhich the p>\s nt Whig pirty was compised had
not been collected t gether Mr B sa d he would
point th  geniicman t > what Mr Van Burea did
do. He vvoi Id point him to h ^ orders to the Dis-
trict Attorney to pn ¡,ecvte with the ut i o t ngois
o! the law any infractions of the neuoa'ity of the
country. He would point the g< ntiem n to an au-
thomy which he, and tho e which took the B.itish
side ot the question, would not gainsay. It was
that of Lord Palmerston himself, who^e statement
of the affair telieved Mr. Van Buren from any im-
putations. All that the gentleman ha! said was
the levered dreams of his own iroagmat o i, and he
would leave him to settle the m .iter v ith his con
stituents. He would now turn to th<- gontltman
from Massachusetts, [Mr, Cdshino ] He com
pUmed that the gentkman from P i isy v„nia,
[Mr lNorttsoiL,] not content w ih Dieting M
Webster in a fair and manly a'gurreru on nan >n 1
law, had made an ungenerous attack o i his pa-
triot ¡>-m Now he had a ruht to exptct that the
g'n'leman from Massachusett would have avoid-
ed the tault that he imputed to another
He expected from the gentleman a discussion on
national lav, but how much was he as omshed the
next day, on  reading his speech m  the InHli
gencer, and finding him making a most virulent at
tack on the conduct and reputation of Mr. Van
Buren.   The gentleman referre I to  the 1 tier of
instructions of Mr. Van Buren to i ur Minister at
the Court of St James, and compared it «iththe in
strueuona of Mr. Webster to the Atotney Grere-
ral; speaking of the latter as brtathn if the state

CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ihe letter of Mr. Van Buren, but the beautiful
composition of Mr. Webster, written forty days
after complying with the Buttsh Mims'er's insult-
ing demands, and inknded to cover over the in-
structions to Mr. Crittenden; after which he cha-
racterizes Mr. Van Buren's letter as a monument
of ignominy. Now Mr, B said he would mine
the same reply that a dignified farmer of Kentucky
did to a lawyer. The lawyer proiecuted the
farmer for a slander, and in the course of the trial
tot k occasion to heap on h m all the abuse and in-
vective of which the bilingsgate vocabu'ary is
capable Yet the jury, without leaving their box,
pronounced a \erdict of acquittal The verdict
of aa honest ¿ad intelligent jury, sa d the
farmer, is a ufficient answer to all your abu-e.
Just so it wai with Mr Van Buren His letter
hsd made a great noise in the country; had been
extensively circulated and read, and ha 1 been as-
sailed with the ulmist virulence by the opposite
pjrty. Yet the highest jury o i tarih, the Amen
can people, had pronounced the acquittal of Mr
Van Buren by electing him to the Chief Ma i-
tr cy The gentleman comolatn d tnat Ihe pa
tno'ism ot Mr. Web>ter not on'y had been as-

lud had the temerity to attack that most beiutiful
or lettir which the patriotic Secre ary wrote to
Mr Pox. Kow heCvír B ) would admit that it
wis a boaun'nl piece of composition, and he
knew oí but one that would cot pare with
