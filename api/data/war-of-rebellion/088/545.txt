Having taken part in all the battles (with but a single exception) of the Army of the Potomac, and having a record which any organization may be well proud of, he hopes that after having sen their friends at hone they will soon return again to remain until this rebellion is crushed and peace and quietness once more prevail throughout the whole Union.

DAVIS HOUSE SIGNAL STATION,

August 27, 1864-9.40 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy shows a strong line of men this a. m. loitering behind the works in front of lead-works. About 300 yards left of lead-works I see through an opening in the trees a double line of works, the second about 200 yards behind the first. At intervals through the woods, for a quarter of a mile right and left of lead-works, I can see breast-works thrown up. I do not know whether any of these works have been before reported. I see no guns in any of them, nor nay unusual activity of working parties.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. L. DAVIS,

Captain and Signal Officer.
