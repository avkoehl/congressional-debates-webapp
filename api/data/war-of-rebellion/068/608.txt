Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy are reported throwing up rifle-pits in front of my left (General Mott), and my skirmishers on the center have come upon rifle-pits occupied. I have given orders to take immediate measures to determine in what force these entrenchments are held. A battery of probably two guns opened on us a few minutes since in front of my center. It fired but a few shots; I answered with artillery.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Corps.
