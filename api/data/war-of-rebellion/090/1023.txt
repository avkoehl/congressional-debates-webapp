The infantry soon came up and Wharton was moved in line to the right and Gordon to the left of the turnpike. Ramseur was moved to the Middle road. Gordon engaged the enemy in front while Wharton turned their left flank and they retreated in confusion. Johnson had engaged their cavalry on the Front Royal road, and Rodes was moved across toward Mrs. Hamiton's to cut off the retreat of the cavalry, but most of them escaped. They made several attempts to stand, but were pressed vigorously by Rodes on the right of the pike and in it, below Winchester, and by Gordon on the left. Rodes continued the pursuit to Stephenson's and the cavalry to Bunker Hill, causing the enemy to burn over seventy wagons and twelve caissons. Gordon pursued to three miles beyond Winchester.
