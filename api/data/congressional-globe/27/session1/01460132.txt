the law. They submitted the question to no less an authority
than Chancellor Kent and James V Ogden of New York,
whether the act-changing the southern boumtaiyof Michigan
was or was not constitutional And what waa their opinion i
Did they asseit that there was no obligation rating on Con
gress m relation to the pub'ic lands'* That ihey bed these
lands unconditionally, to do respecting them just whit they
pleased1* No, sir, no These eminent jurista sanctioned no
suck doctrine
Mr CLIFFORD here interposed, and inquired whether the
gentleman from Michigan assumed that Mr C had advanced
the doctrine that the Constitution authonzedCongtess to vi
olate  the contract made between the old Confederation and^-he
States?
Mi HOWARD replied in the negauve
Mr CLIFFORD If the irentlemanassumcs that I said that
Congress might violate any contiact whatevei, he has entirely
misunderstood me
Mr HOWARD I unders'ood the gentleman to advance
the doctrine that undei that c ause of the Conn tution which
authorizes Coneress to make rules respecting the teintory ef
the United States, Congiess may dispone of the public lands,
just as it thinks fit, altogether irrespective of the deeds of
cession
Mr CLIFFORD Not at all I advanced no such
opinion
Mr  ÍÍ  Then I confess I did not understand what the gentle
man did mean    I now understand him as conceding the law of
the case, and admitting that Oongi ess cam ot depose of the pub
lie domain foi any and all puiposesitmay pleabe, but that there
is a controlling force iff* the provisions of the deeds of cession
Now I insist that, according to Democratic doctrine, it is the
duty of Congress to pay the debt^ of the United fe>rate>,and pi o
videforthe common defence and general welfare,  not out of
funds raised from the sale of the public lands but raised in the
mode the Constitution itself prefer be? foi rai mg them name

sider as the basis of the whole Gentlemen tell u  it is o bring
great relief to the indebted States, and Indiana i^ one of them
Now, we have contracted our own debts, and we ask none of you
pay them Gentlemen need not tell me th-u this is not a pro
positu n to pay our debts, and then to make us pay you back
agam I do no ask the othti States, J do not ask the American
people to pay the debts of indiana, or to aid us m paying them
It is not light, it is not fair Tf it was injudicious in us to con
tract the debt, let the burden fall on us
It is admitted, if I understand the matter, that the public
lands and all will not pay the current expenses of the Govern
ment    And, if so, is not the bill a plan just to takeout of the
pockets of the American people all the money you give to the
States1   If you give it to Indiana m the first place, you will
make all the Union aid to pay it back into the Tt^asury     It is   !
admitted on all hands that there is no surplus     You must,   |
theipfoie, gathei tht   money from out of the pscketsof the
great mass of ihe people    I do not ask favors    We are able to
pay oui own debts     If this money is to be collected from our   ,
own citizens alone, ^ e are no ganters bee mse we must pay it   '
again m another shape     But worse than that so far from be
1112: a benefit to us it is an eternal damag    liom the exptnses   ¡
of collection and disbursement, so that, in fact, you will take   ,
out of our pockets a dollar, a )d pay us back but eighty cents    I
This is not the sort of relief our constituents want    On the   I
principles, therefore, of eternal justice, I consider the proposi
non as iniquitous, and it shall never have my vote
Then theie is another feature in thf bill that I object to    Tt
proposes to give ten per cent over and above then share to the
States where the lands he    Now I say if Indiana is entitlpd to
any more than her regular share in the distnbution,shp is, enti
tied to moie than ten pei cent over    I will answer the gentle-
man from Michigan, [Mr Howard] Hosaysitis very stiange
that the General Government shall find the public land a bur
den, instead of being asource of revenue    ISow I do not be
lieve it  evei wis intended to make the public land a source of
revenue at all    There 1* no other Go\ ei nment on God's toot
stool but this tnat ever thought of selling out its public domain.
No   it was the original intention to have your public domain   ¡
settled by hdtdy independent freemen, it was meantso topar     '
eel out the lands as to give the right of soil to a population that   ¡
should tenant the vast region of rich land m the West and make
it look like a garden, and all the Government should have col    I
lected fromlhem ought to have been just enough to pay its out    j
lay    This shows why the public land never should be treated
asasouice of revenue    But adopt this b 11, and you hold out
in inducement to alltheStates that have got no ne.v lands m   j
their own bounds to raise the price of public lands in the West
that the> mike itasomcc of revenue    Uutthey wan* toscaie

agunst any such consequence    Yes-   and how ta=iy will it bp

w    got  m  debt as we now are   I should have   felt little re
spe t for the honesty of him who made it    But they know that
a few of us are over head and ears in debt, and now they
think they can seduce us    That does not speak much for their
honesty Though I may be the only man throughout the
whole of the ¡states whom it is thus attempted to bribe, who
will reject the bill, 1 shall take pride in thus standing alone, and
I am ready to die in the last ditch before I vote for anv such
bill The old doctrine of the subdivision of this Government
io fast dwindling to nothing Time was, as has wtll been said
by the gentleman írom Maryland, [Mr W C Johnson,]
when the Governor of a Sfate was looked up to with almost as
much reverence as the Piesident, but, during the last four or
five years, the dignity of that office has been fading fast.
Everything is to be merged in the General Government
Every State enterprise is to be managed with reference to this
Government No man can be appointed to office in a State
but he must first be asked whom he goes for as President I
say it is humiliating, and if it is suffered to go on, it willsooa
destroy all State pride and in effect abolish all State boundary
lines When that is done you will practically have destroyed
the etates, and this whole vast country will be consolidated un-
der one grand Government This bill is to be a link m the
chain It will compel the States to come here and ask of this
Governmentto pay the mteieston their debt, apd thus chain
them forever to the wheel of the General Government I am
against it Let us alone, and we will pay our debts Why
make thn* Government a collecting mart for all the States?
Why not let the .States collect their own dues1 But do I ask
why? Here is the secret Many men in the State Legislatures
have gone on with such headlong extravagance, and have run
their constituents so deeply in debt, that now they want tn whip
the devil around the stump, and get somebody else to tase them
(A laugh )
It is a ci aven spmt, they have not nejrve enough to meet the
consequences of their own acts, and therefore, theyiry to
skulk out the difficulty, but their names will dwindle into ob
scunty, and after ages will hisa at their cowardice The gentle
man frem Michigan tells me that he is anxious to pay his debts,
yes, but he does not go to the proper place to pay them He
says that he puts the t laun onihe ground of light Well, lam
glad at any late to hear that it saves us from our humiliation,
not to put it on the ground of bounty, but -tell him his claim
ot right will dwindle to nothing By and by, these lands will
be exhausted, and then the same spirit which now asks for dis-
tribution w 11 come here and ack for a high tariff, and the next
step will be to beg for direct taxation I warn gentlemen this
thing will not stop, it will go on and on until it makes this
House a place for directly taxing all the Union Now is the
time to cut up this =ys'em by the roots Let the oohcy go on,
and it will accumulate debt upon this Government till it -will
reel and tottei under the weight Some gentlemen I know,
hold a national debt to be a national blessing I say it is ana
tional curse, and the heaviest of curses Ot all the base, vile,
contemptible forms of aeivihty, bave mt fiom that of mere
money, which comeseiawhng and crouching, lowei andlower,
cent by cent, chink by chink, till it licks the very earth It
makes my soul sick to think of it W bat' to have States come
here fiom yeai to year and beg of this Government, crying
"give us some of your dollars to help us, and if you have'ntgot
any, do borrow foi us some twehe millions "
1 have said these things now lest, when the bill sets into the
House, I should b cut off by the previous question But I
wish you to keep it in mind then just as if it had been spoken
in the House
I would go foi the last part of the bill if it was not for the
hibtpait I would go foi tail with pleasure if I could but get
the head cut off    [ -v laugh J
I go for pre emption—it to fair and nsrht The gentleman
from Georgia talked about the people of the West getting a
monopoly of these lands Yes,-and how do they monopolize
them? By giving the hardy pioneers, whogo in advance of socie-
ty, and open the wilderness, who bt e 1st every difficulty and bi ave
evtiy danger till they turn the wilderness into hui'ful fields, and
spread it into a spectacle that is beautiful tor the eye to look
upon And aftei they have done all and suffered all aftei
they have been exposed to the tomahawk, and been wasted by
the diseases of a new climate, are they to be treated with con
tumely, and repioaclted becau&e they asked tobe secured in the
fruits o I their labor? I hope not Ihe bill gives us pre emp
tion, it istrue,butitjoins to it distnbuiion I could swallow
the tail, but I choke upon the head of the monster, and the pre-
emption doea not tempt me, bemuse we have got a very good
pie emption bill alreauy
Mr PAYNE of Alabama ro^e and sent to the Clerk's
table a series of sections, when he said he desired
to offei as a substitute for the bill now befoie the Com-
mittee
The CHAIRMAN said that the pending motion was that sub
muted yesterday by the gentleman fiom Maine, [Mr Clif-
ford,] to strike out the enacting clause of the bill, and that, in
osmuch as that motion involved the very exigence of the bill
itself, it was not in order topiopose a substitute or an amend
ment until that notion had been finally disposed of
After some conversation, the proposed substitute was read
foi mforrrration
Mr PVYNB said that it was not his intention togointo
an aigument on the subject, hit  object being merely to submit
a proposition to the committee, for thtir consideration He
did not intend to occupy the attention of the eommittee at this

he might present his viewb in relation to the proposition that he

presented This, however, he rendeitd impossible for some
time, as, scarcely a be itente could be heaid When hn voice
became audibh he was observing that, in his opinion, this mea

the loco Foco  could and would manufacture out of it a splen

that it was, in every ie^pect, in had ta«te
