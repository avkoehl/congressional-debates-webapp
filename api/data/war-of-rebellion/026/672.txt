SUFFOLK, VA., April 30, 1863.

General DIX:

Our gunboats ought not to leave Elizabeth City, as they can command the lowest approach from Carolina by Camden. That route turns South Mills.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

April 30, 1863-6 p. m.

General Dix requests that six 30-pounder Parrott guns, implements, and equipments be sent to him as soon as possible. The enemy are bringing up heavy guns against the works at Suffolk, and these guns, with some 100-pounders that I will get from the forts here, are deemed necessary to meet them.
