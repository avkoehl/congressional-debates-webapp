The corps will keep up communication with each other from time to time, if necessary. The routes and places are by the McDowell map of January 1, 1862. In this, as in all future marches, the corps will, in case of attack, march to the sound of heaviest firing. The Third, Sixth, and Second Corps will follow to-morrow p. m., the Second Corps following the Twelfth; the Fifth Corps following by Germantown and Frying pan; the Third Corps following by Gum Springs. Each corps commander will guard and care for his trains. The Reserve Artillery will follow with the Twelfth Corps, General Slocum. It is suggested to corps commanders that easier marches for the commands will be made by lying by in the middle of the day, and marching early in the morning and late at night. By command of

Colonel MULLIGAN,

Commanding New Creek, W. Va.:

General Kelley is on his way to you. Will reach you to-day from the north. Concentrate all at New Creek. Reconnoiter on the railroad eastward. You can have a stand made, perhaps, at North Mountain. Prevent enemy from getting far westward from Martinsburg. But still get all stores away westward from New Creek, as ordered. Telegraph me until Kelley joins you. Harper's Ferry is held against the enemy.
