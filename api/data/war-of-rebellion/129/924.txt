amount have not yet been obtained, but there will be no difficulty in procuring them. This large claim should no longer be neglected, but to some one should be assigned the special duty of settling and collecting it. Its payment would greatly relieve the treasury.

The statement of the treasurer is herewith submitted, characterized by its usual intelligence and perspicuity. * It requires no comment.

The second auditor's report will also be laid before you. It exhibits a clear and lucid condition of the public debt.

Under the operation of the tax laws of the Confederate Government the right is asserted to tax the stock of the State in her various corporations. This claim was made during the administration of my predecessor and was then abandoned, but is now revived. It is not property, but it is insisted that her property in banks, railroads, and other corporations being in the form of stock, she has merged her sovereignty, and consequently that she has only the rights of private corporations, and is subject to the taxation imposed upon them. This distinction is merely technical, and I forbear criticizing it as I might. The opinion of the attorney-general is strongly against it. As the amount involved is large it should receive prompt attention.

A strong disposition has been evinced from time to time to suppress distillation of grain, &amp;c., but unfortunately the distillation of undried fruit was not included in the prohibition. The recent crop of apples was the most abundant we have had for many years, and would have furnished a large amount of healthy succulents and an ample supply of vinegar, so essential as an anti-scorbutic for our soldiers. But a frenzy almost seems to have seized upon the people for converting this fine crop into brandy, which in its effects upon Army is most pernicious. I earnestly recommend that the law may be enlarged so as to comprehend an inhibition of the distillation of all fruit.

Difficulties still exist in connection with the State salt-works, and the transportation to and from them. It is very much to be regretted that this gift of God to man cannot be enjoyed in peace. The States of North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, through their agents, complain of their treatment in relation to their trains, and believe that they do not obtain that liberal justice which they think the comity between the States could give them. this impression originates, from what I can learn, in the manner in which transportation is conducted on the Virginia and Tennessee road, and in the belief that the private salt of the State superintendent is transported thereon contrary to the spirit of the acts in relation thereto. Be the law as it now stands it is expressly declared "that whenever the manufacture or sale of salt his office shall be declared vacant. " by a contract between the board of supervisors and said superintendent they hire from him 121 negro men, at ten bushels of salt each per month, and twelve negro women, at five bushels per month, each, making an aggregate of nearly 1,300 bushels of salt per month, which necessarily must find a market or be useless to the owner. the right as well as the policy of such a contract may well be questioned. Undoubtedly it nullifies the restriction referred to, and moreover inspires an impression on the part of those interested in the production and transportation of salt that it is to the interest of the super-
