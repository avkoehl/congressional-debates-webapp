THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Aprils,
if he mads a speech on this question, he would
publish m the Globe the speech which he (Mr
M ) made in 1816 against the bank.   Having due
notice, he might as well explain that matter now,
for if he was handled in the Globe,as the Senators
sometimes were, he was fully awaie it would not
be with silk gloves     He did oppose the incorpo
ration of the Bank of the United States, because
he considered its capital as too large, and because
he apprehende 1 that it would nave a baneful influ-
ence on thelibeitiesof the country, and the purity
of our institutions   His fearful forebodings had not
been realized     The bank hid refused to become
a political tool to any party    It had been attempted I
(he said) to render the bank subservient to the
views of the Administration in the same manner |
as the Post Offi e Department was     He spoke of
the number ot mail contractors, &c , under the
influence of the department, forming a disciplined
corps, every member of which wore a collar, with
the inscription of " Andrew Jackson, his dog "
The bank alone had stood out, and the vengeance
of the party—not of the party, for nine tenths of
them were as respectable as any men in the woi Id—
but the vengeance of some or the paity managers
■was poured out upon the bank, because it would
not do—what?   Because it would not contribute
its aid to the plan of merging all the powers of the
Government in the executive power     His fears
had not been realized     Few men, when taken up
to the top of a high mountain, and tempted with
the oifer of wealth and power, would say, " Get
thee behind me, Satan "   None but Diddle and
Duane had withstood Inetemptei      He had voted
against the bank in 1816, because he then thought
it unconstiiutional      X hen, he was a young and
inexperienced member     He had since reviewed
that opinion, and íeveised it     It afforded him
pleasuieto retract the opinion, and he wished to
God that General Jackson could find th  same
pleasure in retracting Ins steps and restonngthe
deposites     He had no prideof opinion to sustain,
and no interest to pi omite, in deciding the ques
tion     lie had never had any connection with the
bank in anyway     lie had been employed in one
or two causes against the binlc, and in one for it
He retracted Ins opinion because he believed it
was an enoneous opinion, and because he believed
that his constituents and State wished the bank to
be recharteied
Mr II then proceeded to discusi, at length, the
expediency oí lechaiteiing the bank, asameasuie

Mi PRESTON said I am sure the Senate will
sympathize with me in those emotions of profound
sonow wi h which I rise to propose the customary
resolutions upon such an event The sudden death
ot Geneial Blair, hi the vigoi of life, and in the
midst of us most strenuous pursuits, cannot fail to
impiess all minds with the most solemn feelings,
which to us are enhanced by his association with
us in the same pursuiis, and by the fact that this
is the second instance tl is session of such an awful
and budden dispensxtion of Piovidence We, his
colleagues of the South CaiohnadeleEa'ion, lament
nil lobs—not the íess that he has diffeied with us
in some points of public policy Such differences
liuvi. nevei extended to personal sepaiation, for
eicli U i excused the zeal of the other by a mu-

HOUSL OB REPRESENTATIVES
Wldve«day, Afiil 2, 1834
After the Journal wt s read-
Mr McDUITJE said
Mr Silaklr I rise to discharge a painful and
melancholy duty, by announcing the death of Gen-
eral J\mls Blair, a Representativefiom theState
of South Carolina The occurrences of the few
last weeks furnish to us all an impressive and
awful ad monition of the pi ecanoustenuie by which
we hold this fleeting and feverish existence, while
we are but too prone to act as if it would never
have an end Scarcely have our feelings recovered
from the violence of the shock pioduced by the
extraordinary and unexampled spectacle of one of
our number falling dead before our eyes, while in
the act of addressing the House on a great ques
tion of deep and absorbing interest, when we are
summoned to pay the last me'ancholy offices of
humanity to another, whose death was equally
sudden
Mr Speaker, I never have been able to fee!,
that on occasions of this kind, panegyric is an
appropriate tribute to the memory of the dead
They are beyond the reach of praise, and u i& not
by this that they are judged, either in this world
or the next Biographical details, however brief,
are, in my opinion, notmoreappropiiate Where
the deceased is ununown, they are seldom of any
interest His name should be his epitaph and
however blank it may appear to the vacant eye of
the passing stranger, it will always have power to
call up the recollection of his virtues in the bosom
of friendship, and the tear of undissembled sorrow
in the eye of affection—offerings more grateful
and congenial to the disembodied spirit than the
proudest monument which human ait can erect,
or the most pompous eulogium which human
eloquence can pronounce Without saying more,
sir, I now ask the House to bestow upon the
memory of the deceased the customary testimo-
nials of respect, by adopting the resolutions I hold
in n y hand
Resolved, That the members of this House will
attend the funeral of the late James Blair, at four
o'clock, this afternoon
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to take
order for superintending the funeral of James Blair,
deceased late a member of this House from the
Slate of South Carolina
Resolved, That the members of this House will
testify their íespect for the memory of James
Blair, by weanng crape on the left aim for thirty
days
The resolutions were adopted
The usual notification thereof having been or-
dered to be sent to the Senate,
On motion of Mr  MeDUFFIE,
The House then adjourned
Messrs MeDUFFIE, WHITTLESEY of
Ohio,SPEIGHT,THOMAS of Louisiana, GIL-
MER, BOON, and BRIGGS, were appointed a
committee to conduct the funeral ceremonies

Chittenden, Vermont, praying a restoration of the
public deDosites to the Bank of the United States,
which was leal, referred to the Committee on Fi-
nance, and ordered to be printed
The VICE PRESIDENT presented the follow-
ing communication fiom the Secretary of the
Treasury, responsive to Mi Clay's resolution of
the 31st March
Tteasury Departmpnt, >
JlpnlZ, 1834     5
Sir In obedience to the resolution of th° Senate
of tne 31st ultimo, requiring the Secretary of the
Treasury " to report to the Senate what amount
of public money is now on deposite in" the Union
' Bank of Maryland, when and on what account it
' was def osited, and also, whether any treasury
' drafts, contingent, or other, have been, during
' the month of March, 1834, furnished to the said
'bank, or at any time heretofore to the Bark of
'Maryland for any and what purpose, and that
'he likewise report what amount of stock n the
' capital of the said Union Bpnk was held by R B
' Taney, Esq , when the said bank was selected as
' one of the banks to receive on depositethepublie
' money, and what amount of the said stock he
•now holds," I have the honor to transmit here-
with a statement (marked A to U) of the public
money deposited in the Union Bank of Maryland,
showing when it was deposited and on what ac-
count The difteience between the balance to the
credit of the Treasurer, in his statement, and in
that furnished by the bank, arises from warrants
which have been issued by the Treasurer on the
bank, but which have not yet been presented for
payment, and a deposite to his credit since the last
weekly return
