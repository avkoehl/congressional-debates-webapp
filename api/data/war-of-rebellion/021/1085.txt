GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DIST. OF TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ., No. 66. Corpus Christi, Tex., May 20, 1863.

The major-general commanding takes this opportunity to express officially to Colonel [A. M.] Hobby, and the officers and men under his command, his high sense of the heroic gallantry which has rendered successful their efforts in repelling the attempts of the enemy to effect a landing on this part of the coast,* and of their activity and energy exhibited in the recent brilliant affair which resulted in the capture of a launch, with 5 of the enemy, and the death of 12 or 15 others. This gallant feat was performed by 28 men of Captain [E. E.] Hobby's company. Major-General Magruder feels sure that those od the troops who have been ordered to Louisiana bore with them willing hearts and strong arms to assist their sister State in expelling the ruthless invader, and begs to assure those who remain that he feels confident that Texas will be only defended while her sons stand between the enemy and their loved homes.

By command of Major-General Magruder:

E. P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
