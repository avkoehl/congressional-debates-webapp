Major-General BUTLER:

Captain Low, quartermaster of the Naval Brigade, has arrived from Norfolk with the information that the gun-boat Shrapnel sunk in the canal two days ago, while on her way to Norfolk for repairs. As the accident has arisen through the unauthorized interference of General Shepley with the boat, which has extended to giving leaves of absence to engineers and taking her captain and crew from her without consultation with me, I request you will telegraph General Shepley to discontinue his interference, and I will send Captain Low immediately to Fort Monroe to make arrangements with Colonel Webster for raising the vessel and saving the property.
