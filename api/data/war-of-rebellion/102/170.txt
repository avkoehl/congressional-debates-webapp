HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, April 24, 1865.

Admiral THATCHER, or

COMMANDING OFFICER U. S. NAVAL FORCES,

New Orleans:

The telegram from Donaldsonville received this morning seems partially confirmed by the subsequent one carrying intelligence that the telegraph wire was cut at Orange Grove (short distance below Donaldsonville) by a boat's crew from a gun-boat this morning. There may be some probability, therefore, that the enemy have planned a method of destroying our shipping or of getting their gun-boat to the sea. I feel it my duty to inform you that we have no guns at any point bearing upon the river except at Forts Jackson and Saint Philip, they having all been removed last spring in obedience to orders from Washington.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,New Orleans, April 24, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICERS FORTS SAINT PHILIP AND JACKSON;

Information is received that a rebel ram passed Donaldsonville. If the report has foundation it must be their intention to run the mouth of the river. You will be in readiness for any movement of that kind if it should occur.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,New Orleans, April 24, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICERS FORTS JACKSON AND SAINT PHILIP:

Have you received any orders about preparing for the rebel steamer said to be coming down the river with the intention of escaping to the Gulf? Reports at once your preparations.

By command of Major-General Banks;

J. SCHUYLER CROSBY,

Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Asst. Adjt. General
HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, La., April 24, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER FORTS JACKSON AND SAINT PHILIP,

Fort Saint Philip, La.:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs me to inform you that it is reported that a rebel ram is coming down the river, and that she passed Donaldsonville this morning at 4 o'clock. It may be that she will try to run into the Gulf. Be prepared, therefore, to sink her with your 15-inch guns and 100-pounder Parrotts. The general desires that you will make the whole of your armament as useful as possible. Acknowledge receipt.

P. J. MALONEY,

First Lieutenant, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
