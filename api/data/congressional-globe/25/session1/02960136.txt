the gold and s lver coinage of those coun-
tries by more than a fourth, and that the mines
are constantly poming in new sjpphes, which
are capable ot still further increase Take
these facts into considetation, ami there is every
reason to believe that the supply of these metals
•would be adequate to our purposes, if Governments
would abandon their contrivances for furnish-
ing a paper money currency The general tendency
of the metallic currency, through a ser es of ages,
has been to increase somewhat faster ihan the ma-
terial wealth of the woild, so that experience would
here seem to support me independently of theory.
This very circumstance has sometimes operated to
affect seriously those contracts which embrace a
long period of time in their execution, as is the case
in some of the English leases But this change has
been so gradual, that the great mass of contracts,
which were for a shorter time, have been adjusted
by this measure of value without serious inconve-
nience If any improvement upon this metallic
currency has been suggested m modern times, it is
parhaps to be found in some such expedient as that
of the bank of Amsterdam, a system which, upon
an actual deposit of specie, issues a like amount of
paper, for the actual return of w hich specie, upon
the demand oí the beaier of the paper, the faith of
the State is pledge 1, or some security, equally un-
doubted, is given The advantage of this circula-
tion is, that it vanes piec sely tilth gold and silver
as astandard of v-ilue, thatitsaves the loss by wear
of these metals, and renders them in effect as portable
as paper
If the State Governments will have a paper cur-
rency, this is undoubtedly the safest mode in which
they can put it forth But a paper currency put
forth by Government on any other principle, will
always have the unfortunate effect of contuvtrlly
changing the mc sine of value by which contracts
are to be adjusted Diffeient Governments adopt
different rules of issue The proportion of paper
currency to material wealth, is different m each.
A man contracts, expecting to deliver by one
standard, and owing to its change is forced to de-
liver by another He receives, perhaps, m ounces,
and is forced to return m pounds This injurious
change in the relations between debtor and creditor,
Isids to disasters and snfTeungs, so often witnessed
thit I need not depiitthem Other Governments
ha-.3 means of palliating the evils of this sudden
change m ihcmtdsure of value, not vv ithin our reach
When a demand is made ior a sudden adjustment
in specie, ofcontracts formed under the expectation
that they are to be redeemed in paper, these Go-
vernments can, and alvv a>> s do, interfere to prev ent
this change in the rtlalions between debtor and
creditor They make the piper a legal tender be-
tween man and man Indeed, the Engl sh Govern-
ment teems to be well aw are of the necessity of
making paper curiency a tender, ifter it is once is-
su d, it sees «o clearly that contracts will always be
made under the evpeolation of redeeming them in this
paper, and that it would be impossible to force their
adjus ment m specie, that it has made the paper of
the Bank of England a legal tender by a standing
law of the land Here we can resort to no such expe-
dient Noihmg but gold and silver can be •made a
legal tender, a p->mt of difference which no Ameri-
can statesman should lose sight of What folly is
it, then, to introduce by legislation a standard of
measure in the formation of contracts, which can
always be altered by the creditoi a his pleasure, m
despite of our law-,1 How vast and complex is the
fraud which we thus practice upon our citizens,
when we mdrsctly force them to contract by one
standard, uhi'st the Constituiion requires them to
pay by another1 If a law were passed requuing
every man who had contráete I to deliver a bushel
of corn to deliver two, the injustice would not be
greater, nor the mischief more, than our paper cur-
rency has often produced So much, Mr Chair-
man, for the operation of our banking syviem upon
file eurrenej, let us twe no  its f T cts upon credit
What is credit! and what i  the real law which
regulates its expansion and contraction? Credit,
sir, is the contrivance bv which we translate future
resources to onr present use and employment, or m
other words, «affords ih  mean* by a hich we obtain
the present use of capital by a pledge of future
r sources—of resources which exist either in mind
or matter—of resonrces to be found, sir, either in
our skill and mdustrv, or m capacities yet to be
developed in our material possessions. The fabric
of credit, to enduie, sir, must rest on the solid rock
of responsibility, and not upon the fleeting sands of
mere confidence or, sir, if I may change the figure,
credit is the venoussystem through which the stream
of capital flows, to visit every part of the body
politic wi h its life-dispensing power Disturb for
a moment the free and natural course of its circu-
lation, and you derange every function of social
life Leave it to follow its natural course , and it
will quicken anew the «pint of enterprise, impart
more vigor to the arm oí moustry, and dispense
health and freshness to the frame and spirit which
it supports and vivifies.
1 have said, «ir, that it was the pledge of future
resources, for the present use of existing cap tal
To make the operation beneficial, this pledge must
be upon real resource*, so that the borrower may
not only return the principal and interest of the
capital employed, but also retain a profit himself
If his employment returns him an amount just
equal to, or a less amount, than the principal
and interest of this capital, there is a clear
loss to society of his labor, at least, and perhaps of
more It is manifest, then, that this operation, if
beneficial to society must be founded upon íeal
resources, and new capacitiesfor producing wealth
There is a certain amount of capital in the world,
to which Government can not add by any of its
regulations This is all which can Le distributed,
and if the credit system exists m a sound condi-
tion, this capital will be distributed between the
differents parts of the world, and amongst different
individuals in society, m the relative proportion of
their comparative resources That country which
can give most for the use ot capital will be first
supplied, according to the laws of trade, and any
community which, directly ormdirectly, gets posses-
sion of more capital than its relative resouices enti tie
it to enjoy, receives it upon the terms of paying for
the use of more capital than it can advantageously
employ. This, sir, could never be the case if Go-
vernment were not to interfere, but, unhappily for
mankind, it too often happens that a Government,
under the vain hope of benefiting its people, pur-
sues a sj stem of measi res which disturbs the natu-
ral level of capital For an instance of this, I need
only refer to the currency operation of our bank-
ing system I hav e shown, sir, that the operation of
this system has a tendency to increase the currency
of the country, m which it exists, fai beyond the
basis of the metallic, which is the currency of the
world The nominal amount of money is in-
creased, and its real value diminished Suppose,
for instance, that two dollars represent the same
amount of the neeessanes of life which were for-
merly represented by one The capital which is
borrowed at this nominal rise in its money price,
must be returned when the nominal price falls, and
the real value is raised In other words, the com-
munity which boriowed in half dollars must return
in dollars. The reason of this is obvious The
credit system of any country, when it is sound,
rises or falls with its relative resources This is
the true and single law of its valuation But Go-
vernment interposes and alters the measure of va-
lue It doubles, foi instance, the proportion be
tween the paper currency, and the ma'enal wealth
of the country, by forcing every addition made to
cted't, through the banks, to produce a like adeli-
tion m cmrency The country, then, which has
fewest resources in comparison with others, may
have the laigest nominal credit system, on account
of the moidmate expansion of the standard by
which its value is measured
The credit system being thus expanded, Jet us
look for a moment into the mode of redeeming the
obligations thus incurred This debt can only be
discharged by a sj sters of exchange, uneler which
one debt is made *o off et another, so as to saye (he
necessity for cuirency, or else by redeeming the
obligations in money So far as the exchanges ad-
just the balances due on a certain day throughout
the country, the operation is beneficial and the re-
lations between elebtor and creditor are not ruin-
ously affected, notwithstanding the inflation of the
currency. But in this diseased state of affairs, the
operation of the conversion of that portion of the
credit system which must be ledeemed by money
is terrible The obligations w ere contracted upon
the paper standard, but they must be redeemed m
specie, if the creditor chooses to demand it, and
this he will do, if the paper curre ncy exceeds its just
proportions, because then it will be to his interest
to exact this mode of adjusting contracts So far
then, Mr Chairman, I have endeavored to prove
to this committee that our banking system pro-
duces, first, an unjust distribution of capital be-
tween the different sections of the same country
and the different classes of the same society and,
secondh, •' af the connection which it instiluted
between cuuency and ctedit caused them both to
expand and contract, according to laws different
from those w hich nature had prescribed for their
regulation If I have been successful in my effort,
I have shown that these effects must flow from the
very laws of their cieation, and that this was the
original sin of them both
I know, sir, that some advantages have also
resulted from their operation, but none, in my
opinion, which compensate for these evils The
advantage of adjusUnglhe balances, due undei the
credit system, by exchange oi offset, so as to avoid
a direct result to currency, is immense, and it is
true that a large capital is necessary for this busi-
ness It is necessary, because the gieatei the va-
riety of exchanges commanded by any one institu-
tion, the greater the facility for offsetting the one
debt against another The limit to this advantage
is only to be found when the amount of capital
employed in this way, by any one institution, is so
gr<=at as to preclude competition It w as the opinion
of Mr Baring, howsver, one of the most intelli-
gent of English merchants, when examined before
a committee of the House of Commons on this
subject, that the important business of exchange
could be effected more readily through private
dealers than by banking institutions, and there
seem to exist strong reasons for his opinion Be
this as it may, however, and let us suppose, for
argument's sake, that m a young country like ours
we can only raise capital enough to deal m ex-
changes, domestic and foreign, by means of corpo-
rations, still I maintain, sir, that these corporations
snonld be single in their end and aim They
should be confined to the business of dealing m
exchanges, and all power of issue should be denied
them If the banking system of this country is
ever reformed, the change must be conducted in that
spirit of analysis whichhaseffected most of the mo-
dern reforms m science If currency be the object of
the Constitution, I have already intimated the model
upon which I think it should be moulded If the re-
gulation of exchange and the diffusion of loanable
capital be the object, the institution should be con-
fined to this end alone A currency bank should
exist for currency alone, without the power to dis-
count, and a bank oí discount should be confined
to that purpose without the power to issue The
true secret, I believe, sir, of regulating the ma-
chinery of corporations so that it shall work the
piecise end intended for it, and no other, is to
cieate them with a single purpose, upon which they
will then be sure to move But, sir, unite m them
incompatible iuretions, and you are opt to íntio-
duce a complexity into then operations, which w ill
often produce results entnely unexpected at then
creatio i, and contrary to the public good
I believe, sn, that the history of our system
of paper currency connected vv ith credit, as we
have instituted that connection, would illustrate
the truth of my views, if there were time to enter into
this inquiry I will r-ot raise an issue of fact, how-
era, when my purpose is satisfied by dealing with
first principles I will not enter into the history
of that early struggle between the colonies of Mas-
sachusetts and Rhode Island, for the field of circu-
lation which each was endpavonng exclusively to
occupy with its paper issues , a contest which
waxed so warm as to make a reference of their
disputes to the Crown necessary for the preserva-
tion of peace Neither will I occupy the commit-
tee with the history of that continental money,
whose improvident issue was said by one who
both felt and knew its consequences, to have caused
