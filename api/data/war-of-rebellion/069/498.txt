General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I did not get into my camp until after daylight, and was waiting for connection by telegraph before reporting. In the mean time Colonel Platta rived, and has returned to you with all necessary information. Our fight last night was more serious than I reported, but the attack was handsomely repulsed. Prisoners taken this mooring show that A. P. Hill is in front of our right in an entrenched position, about where I indicated to the general commanding yesterday. In what respect is General Warren's position changed since yesterday morning? Where are his headquarters?
