Major-General BURNSIDE:

You will move forward to Chilesburg the moment you can get the trains started. If you can find another road in supporting distance of the one you have been directed to move on, and by which other troops have not been ordered to march, so as to double your train, you will do so.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

General Burnside wishes to know whether a pontoon train has been ordered to report to him with engineers. He says he will follow the trains as quick as they can move. I shall start for headquarters in a little while, unless something turns up to keep me here.

Yours, &amp;c.,

O. E. BABCOCK.

I have sent pontoon trains in the train you convoy, but you will not need one.
