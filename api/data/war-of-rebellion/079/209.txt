ROME, October 11, 1864-10. 20 a. m.

General SHERMAN:

As soon as I get my bridge across the Oostenaula I will throw all my cavalry across, to feel toward Dirt Town and Summerville. There must have been a considerable force went up toward Summerville, because they were passing from 8 o'clock until 12, when I drew my pickets in and took up the bridge. I had a man come in from about Cave Spring early this morning. He lay in the bushes near the pickets; heard infantry moving WEST from Cave Spring; nothing definite as to who or what they were. I don't think all of Hood's army has crossed the Coosa yet. A negro from Cedartown this morning says that there are large wagon trains there yet, left there by the army crossing the Coosa.

General CORSE:

It is better I should get the whole army into shape and watch the distant points. I may come down if facts indicate Hood's moving between Rome and the Tennessee, but I rather think he will do nothing of the kind, save to send cavalry up to Dalton or Ringgold. He will not attack Rome. He may swing back to Georgia. Keep me well advised, and I will come down the moment it is proper.

General CORSE:

I have an official report* from General Kilpatrick, at Van Wert. He attacked and whipped Ross and Ferguson badly, and to-day would push to Cedartown and toward Rome. I think all the cavalry of the enemy south of the Etowah will be fully occupied, and I want you to look WEST with cavalry and south with scouts. He reports possibly the rebel army moving for Blue Mountain.

General CORSE,

Rome:

As a rule, don't accumulate much supplies, but only what you can haul. You know what I contemplate. If Hood goes up between Rome and the Tennessee, I will be at him; but if he go to Blue Mountain, why let him go.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
