these movements of the enemy, constraining the withdrawal of the forces from Powell's Valley, will deprive you of the support it was contemplated to render you, should it become necessary. Will therefore have to rely upon your own resources in the event of being attacked. Should the enemy be defeated at Chattanooga, the command will return and give you such aid as it may be in the power of the commanding general to render you. If defeated, then General Smith will fall back in this direction, that he may effect a junction with your command. Colonel Allston has instructions

to watch the approaches over the mountains, and to give you prompt information of any demonstration which may be made from that quarter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel BENJAMIN ALLSTON,

Commanding First Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding instructs me to direct your attention to the importance of watching the approaches to Knoxville. In addition to the general directions lately given you, he desires that a sufficient force for this purpose should be placed at the crossing at the confluence of Powell's and Clinch Rivers, and also at the intersection of the Fincastle road with the road to Cumberland Gap from Knoxville, 4 miles beyond Maynardsville. You will make such disposition of your force as will accomplish the objects communicated to you now and in the last letter from this office, giving prompt intelligence to these headquarters and to Brigadier-General Stevenson of any advances which may be made. Brigadier-General Barton has been ordered to the terminus of the Kentucky Railroad,from which point orders will be given him to proceed to Chattanooga. He is to leave a small battalion at Clinton which it is intended shall support you. In the event retreat before superior force should become necessary you will fall back for the protection of Knoxville. It is believed that Clinton will be your proper line of retreat, but of course you must be governed by circumstances surrounding you at the time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
