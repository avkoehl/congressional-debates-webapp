If, therefore, we were to regard the aforesaid,re-
solution as designed by you to mstiust us, and con-
trol our votes, we csuld not, consistently with what
we believe to be due to the known principles ©f the
majority m the Stale, consider ourselves, bound by
it, because we must regard It as an unauthorized
aet on > oui part, and a violation ofthe-nghts of
your constituents, who hold us as responsible te
them, and not to you, who do not admit that we
can avoid the responsibility which belongs to our
stations by any act of yours
We have endeavored to show what are the opi-
nions of your constituents in respect to the doctrire
of instruction, but we are at a loss to discover what
your principles are on that subject. You have voted
down a proposition which asserted the right of in-
struction, and have nevertheless passed a resolu-
tion which purports to instruct us The only in-
terpretation we can put on conduct so inconsistent
and extiaordinaiy is, that you regard the doctrine
of instruction as unsound in punciple, and yet are
willing to use it against Senators who may be poli-
tically opposed to jou, eilher to control then ac-
tion, which you admit you have no right to do, or
to force them to resign Such a proceeding, so i ,-
consistent with the character of an honorable and
e (lightened Legislature, we have witnessed with
the deepest regret, as we cannot but regard it as.
deiogatoiy to the character of the State, which must
suffer when Us legislative councils so far forget
what is due to their high functions as to practise
the most p-Uiry artifice and trickery to effect selfish
pirtv pirp<ses It you d-iy the principle of in
st uction jou are piecluded from passing any valid
instructing resolution, and any attempt to do it can
hive no binding force, as the obligation to obey
rests entirely on the right to instruct.
With ditto uews of the subject, we would re-
spectfully mlormyou that we cannot consider the
.iforesii I resolution as having any binding force
a1- an instruction, intended to control eur action,
even if such was the fair import of the language, as
you disclaim the right to instruct.
The only light, therefore, in Tihich we can re-
gard the resolution, is as an expression of the will
or opinion of the Legislature In this view of it,
the lespect to which it is entitled depends, in part,
upon the reasons which appear to have influenced
the action <f the General As embl), and all we
know on this point is contained in the preamble
to the icsohuion We presume that the act re-
ferí ed to is the Sub-Treasury or Independent
Tioisury b II, is the bill which passed the Senate,
entitled "An act to impose additional dulies on
ceitarn public officers," etc From the terms,how-
e\er, in which you speak of this bill, we should be
almost led to believe that you could not be ac-
quainted with its provisions, and that you must
h ive foimed your opinions concerning it from the
polluted sources of the Bank presses of the country
If the provisions of ihe bill had been examined,
we are persuaded that neither prejudice or perver-
* ty of judgment, however great, could have led
the Geneul Assembly to express the opinion that
Hi s aJ "is, m its character and tendency, contrary
lo the spun of our fiee institutions, dangerous to
our liKrties, and de tractive to oui dearest inte-
rests " You do not inform us what provision or
what pi maple there is in ihe act which is pregnant
vviih such dreadful consequences We are left
entirely m the dark on this subject If you hul
only pointed out what there is in ihe act fraught
with such consequences, it would have afforded us
great relief, as we should have been as ready to
oppose and to denounce it as were the majority of
the General Assembly
The principle of the act is, that it is the right and
the duty of the Government to manage its own
revenues, hrough the agency of its own officers
This is the principle of the bill, all the rest is mit-
ter oí detail Do you •nean to assert ihat this
principle is, "in i s charac'er and tend' ncy, con-
trary to the spirit of our free institutions and dan-
gerous to our liberar-?" Do s ou believe that the
liberties of the country would be endangered by
entrusting the revenues of the people to the sworn
officers of the Government, subjected to the strict-
est accountability' What would you have- the
Government uo?   If it cannot trust its own pflicers,
pray whom can it twistí Can it confide with more
safety in the officers of moneyed corporations? Is
there  o danger to liberty from a paitnership be-
tween the Government and the banking institutions
of the country, whether State or National1?
We are equally at loss to perceive what there is
In this bill which should have led the General As-
sembly to believe that, should it become a law, "it
would still further derange the currency, prostrate
business, spread rum and desolation through all
clases of society, and change the present distress
into a settled and deep-rooted despair." This ¡s
truly a most gloomy and horrid picture of distress,
and we can hardly imagine how the General As-
sembly, penetrated with such fearful apprehensions,
could have adjourned without having adopted some
measures to have averted from the people of the
State a threatened calamity, which could only be
equalled by the "pestilence which walkeih in dark- ,
ness, and wasteth at noonday " Foi tunately, these
terrible calamities exist no where, unless it be m the
minds of the enemies of this measure, and whether
they exist theieornot—whether they are feigned,
or the lesulls of a diseased imagination—we leave
for the world to decide, by contrasting the w rds
with ihe notions of all these pi >phets ot wo
The bill has not become a liw, but us puno pics
have been practically camel into opuat on in Ihe
management of ihe finances, for more than a jeai,
and instead of the cuirency becon ing "still fuuher
deranged," it has been giadually improving, and
instead oí "business being prostrated, and desola-
tioi and mm spread through all classes of society,'
business has been steadily reviving, and is now
nearly recovered /rom the severe revulsion occa-
siojcd by the explosion ot the banks, and an un-
precedented course of over-trading fot the two pre-
ceding years And as to the desolation and ruin,
we believe that they exist no where in our fair and
piosperous land, except in the jeremiads of ihe
panic orators
We are, therefore, happy to be able to inform
you that these apprehended calamines to the peo
pie of Ihe State and counuy are enlire'y ground
less
Another reason assigned is, "that, if said lull
should become a law, it will provide one enrrencj
foi ihe oflice holders, and an inferior one for Ihe
i people " Tins objection, we are persuaded, cannot
I luve been den vid írom an examination of the b 11,
but nas, probably, been received fiom the sperohes
of the opponents of th  measuie in ihe Stnate,
where it has figured largely The objection w ouUI,
undoubtedly, have great weight in it, was it true,
but, unfortunately for those who use it, there is not
one particle of truth in it
The bill, as it passed the Senate, provides no
currency either for office holders or the people It
has nothing to do with the question of currency,
even so far as respects the public revenues, a« ihat
depends on existing laws As the bill containi no
provisions whatever, in relation to the currency, it
is certainly a great mistake to say that "it provides
one currency for ihe office holders, and an inferior
one for the people "
And in íespea to other laws, the Federal Govern
ment provides but one cuirenci, and toat is go'd
anl silver, which is both for oflice ha deis and the
people    The  inferior currency to which we pre-
sume you allude, we suppose must be the paper
,    emissions of the banks, which we would beg leave
to inform you are Hot "provided" by the Federal
Government, but by State legislation    Of this ím-
I   portant fad, we presum  the majority of th  Gene-
|   ral Assembly were not ignorant, yet H would seem
that it did not occur to them when urging the last
I objection to the measuie under consideration
I      As  the friends of a sound currency, and to i
much greater extent than now exist  of a meii'lio
currency,  we are  rej need  to  perceive that the  I
General  assembly, are of the opinion, that bank
l   paper is an "infer or currency" lo gold and s Iver
j   This sound and highly important opimo-i, promises
'    well for the interests of tne Stit^, and we hope and
I   trust that it w ill be carried out m its future k¿is-
|    lation
' With these views of the reasons assigned by the
Legislature, and with the strong convictions which
ne entertain of  the necessity, justice, and   im-
portance of the measure m question, we must
respectfully inform you, that should the bill
again come before the Senate, we shall feel it our
duly to give it oui support, although we regret to
differ on so important a measure with  be General
Assembly, and perhaps with the majority of our
consumer  ts.
Here we might stop, having said all that is ae-
cessaiy to explajn our course, and the reasons for
it, but an apprehension that we may be charged
with having studiously avoided an expression of
our own op ntons, regarding ihe doctrine of instruc-
tion, induce* us to go something farther, ihat the
particular case seems to require
We do not wish to disguise oar opinions on th 
or any other subject, as our constituents have a
right to know what they ate. The doctrine of m-
stiuction rests on a popular principle, and w e are,
and ever have been, fully persuadid that ihe just
and proper Administration of our Government,
both Stale and National, counted in giving a lull
development to, and justly and fan!) cirrying out,
nil the populai principles m the system Con^idct-
in^ the right of instruction as one of tnese prin-
ciples, wg respeel it, and feel boon I to canj it out to
the u most hunt of the Constitution Farther than
this, wo cannot go as long as the Cuistnut on re-
in ins ,is it is If it is deemed necessaiiy to citry
this, or any other popuhr principle farther, it must
be done by chingmg Ihe Constitution When
the question arises in that lorm, thete can be no
embanassmentfrom existing institutions, andevery
one is left free to follow out this or any other popu-
lar principle, so far as, in his judgment, will best
conduce to the safety, liberty, and happiness of the
people—the j tst ends of all Government We be-
lieve in, ai a will sustain, the i ght of instruction,
so far as it is consistent with ihe Cons i vmon, and
no farther, s>s that is the supreme law ot the land,
which we have swiin i support To viola e it,by
pushing to an exlieme, a popular principle, is sti 1
a violation and-^though the end may be good, the
means cannot be justified
\s ihe pnnc iple of instruction is understood m
some the States n appears to be dnectly in ¡on-
(lict with the spirit, if not the Icitei, of the Consti-
tution , and to the extent tint it is so, it appears
to us to be on unsound and even a dangerous
doUnne It is held ihat the light of the Legisla-
ture to instruct carries with it the unqu^luied obli-
gation on the part of the Senator to obey or resign.
This is substantially lo change the Constitution,
•it (1 lo alter the tenure oí the office of Senator
Under the Constitution, a Senator holds his oflice
f< r six years, and as it has prescribed no restr c-
tun, limitation, or qualification wha'soever, it
buomes a constitutional light, andequallj a con-
stitutional obligation, to exercise his own jt dg-
ment on al! questions that come before the Scaate,
and to ft free fiom compulsion or coercion in my
form To hold, ther,- ore, that t ie Legislature
have a right to absolutely con ol U'P \ ote of a
Senator, or force him to res gn, is incnis stent
wnh the Constilulion , for if he obejs against Ins
judgment, the vo e he s*ivts is not his own, out
t idt of the Legislature, which has no constitutional
neht to ¡jive a vote in the Senate, an 1 is given by
him by compulsion, in -violation < f ihat freedom oí
action which the Constitution gin-antees, not only
tohnn, but to the whole body oí his constit i ts,
as well the minority as t'tt majority If he refuses
to obej, and resigns his seat by coihputsi-m, that is,
changing the tenure oí his oflice, and instead of a
term of six vears, he holds s dur ng the pleasure,
of the Legislaluie, not to exceed six jear*-, whica
is mcoisis c i   wuh the Constitution
