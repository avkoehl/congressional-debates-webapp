commanding District of West Louisiana, has been directed to give you every assistance in his power. You can therefore consult with him in carrying out your plans. The staff officers designated by yourself can all accompany you, except Colonel Brent and Major Mason. Their services are too essentially necessary in the administration of the District of West Louisiana to admit of their being dispensed wit. Major- General Walker, commanding District of West Louisiana, and Brigadier-General Thomas, commanding the brigade of exchanged Vicksburg prisoners, report the condition of that brigade so reduced in numbers and so disorganized that it is not effective for service. To attempt its crossing would be a serious loss of men and be detrimental to the interests of the service. Many of the men have not been exchanged and are not in camp. It is but a few days since notification was received of the exchange of any portion of the brigade. Under these circumstances I shall retain the brigade in the department, continue the collection and organization of the men, and when effected (if the necessities of our armies there require it) will order it across the river to your command. I have ordered the Crescent Regiment, stationed at Shreveport, immediately down, and believe it will join you before the crossing is effected. This regiment is large and will render you as much service as the disorganized command of General Thomas could possibly have done.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.

Major General J. G. WALKER,

Commanding &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I inclose a copy of a letter* to Lieutenant General R. Taylor with regard to the crossing of the troops under his command. I desire you to select four batteries of light artillery to accompany General Taylor's column, and suggest that the selection be made from the following batteries: Nettles' Valverde Battery, H. C. West's Arkansas battery, Boone's Louisiana battery, Cornay's Louisiana battery. The four batteries selected to be commanded by a major of artillery. You will perceive from my letter to General Taylor that I have directed the immediate crossing of the troops. The collection of material and the preparations necessary for throwing a bridge across the Mississippi River necessitate a delay of at least thirty days, and I believe is of doubtful success. This delay would neutralize any good results which might come from the crossing of this column.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
