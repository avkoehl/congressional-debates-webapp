confinement and in irons at Wheeling, W. Va., by the State government of Western Virginia.

For what cause Gandy and Dusky are in confinement we are not informed. I inclose the written communication from Major Turner, commandant of this prison, stating the cause why we were taken out of the general prison and placed in solitary confinement.

I would further state that we have both of us been general prisoners of war for several months. That we are in consequence greatly debilitated physically; are now quite unable to bear imprisonment of this character. We have been in close confinement for the last six days. Therefore, in view of the great suffering we have already endured, we pray that our Government will not leave us now in our new and greater peril as our physical energies must soon be destroyed, but that we may be speedily released and exchanged and restored to our respective commands.

Your obedient servant,

DANIEL R. BOICE,

Captain E. Company, Third New Jersey Cavalry.
