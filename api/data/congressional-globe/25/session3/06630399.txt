25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Defaulters—Mr. Wise.
Ho.,of Reps.
tioiler and Solicitor, Barker and Gilpin, dated at
Ne«v Yoik, Nov. mber 8, 1S3S, (page 19, of this
Document No   13,) we leain the following fact:
' It appeared that the last settlement of his accounts at
tl c Ti eu uní vv ii up to tne 31si Deeemler la't, (Dccembm,
183< ) and that, though lio was called on by the First Aud-
¡loi.aid nonce ~ub equently givm to hi  sureties by the
Comp'iollet, hv, accounts and touchers from that time to fie
2oí i of Match, 1833, uhen his teim of office expired, had
neier been J ui nuked "
Indeed, su, it fully appears that he was never
made to ittuin his accounts and vouchers at all;
they weie not íetuined, as you see by the letteis
lead lona; after his escape. Now, why was this >
Whet was the balance against him lnDecember,
1837'    The same íepoit infoims us:
" The state-l b dance iigunn bun on the 31st of Decern
ber, 1837 was $9,678 984 56 ; this however, was known to
include all the uncollected bonds not due, bonds m suit &.c
rl .lis made it necessary, as the accounts and \oucbers weie
not furnished, that immediate sti pi should be taken to as
eer'ai i the sum really due is aceur itely as possible "
Were such steps taken ' None, none' Time
aftei time was Mr Swartwout requested and
thanked to return his accounts. Time aftei time
he failed. It was left, as it weie, optional to fui-
nishlns voucheis oi not; he chose to furnish none;
he eloped on the 16th of Ausust, 1838, and no
such step was taken at all until the oí ders toTJndci-
wood in Novembei, 1838—twelve month's after it
wasiiecessuu/foi "immediate steps to be taken"—
to proceed to New Yoik '
But again, sn. From this repoi t, pages 33,34,
it docs appear that the accounts of Swartwout,
for the term commencing Octobei l,and ending
December 31, 1837, incie made out at the First
Auditoi 'sofficcaseailyasMay, l&38,showingthe
balance due the United States to be <>9,678,984 56.
Here is this statement in full, icpoitcd by the
First Auditor, and ceitified by the Comptioller,
and ceitified by theRegistei and Woodbuiy him-
self. Why was this delay fiom December, 1837,
to May, 1838, and why, when reported jn default,
was Swartwout permitted to escape as late as Au-
gust, without accounting at all '
Again, sir; it further appears, from the second
report of Barker and Gilpin to Woodbury, dated
New York, November 15, 1S38, that one of the
funds in which there is a deficit is the fund of
" foifutures and penalties "
" The ' forfeúui es and penalties' belonging to the United
States constitute the second fund in which theie is a deficit
It amounts, in the aggregate, to $¿9,823 12
" Ot this there occurred—
In the year 1832, the sum of  ................539,632 46
In the year 1833, the sum ot...............    3 674 04
In the year 1834, the sum of  .................     1,1/3 09
In the year 183d, the sum of..................    5 313 53
$39 813 10
" By the provisions of the eighty-mnth section of the act
of the 2d of March, 1799, the collector is to receive trom
the court all sums received on account of fines, penalties,
and forfeitures, for a breach of the revenue laws, and he is
to account for them quarterly to the Treasury The sum
above stated belonged to the United States, as their portion
of various penalties and forfeitures, and was received by
Mr Swartwout under the above provision It was not,
however, debited in his own cash account; and though ad-
mitted in his accounts rendered to the Treasury, it has
never been paid over "
These sums you see were received by the col-
lector from the courts of record. Now, if proper
supervision had guarded his official conduct, was
it not the easiest thing m the world to detect his
deficit in this fund by inspection of the court's
records' Was there ever such inspection'  None.
Again: Another fund in which was a deficit was
that consisting of" three Tieasmy wmrants:"
" Three Treasury warrants, amounting m the aggregate
to $39,240 05, were received by Mr Swartwout during the
years 1834 and 1835. They were for the following sums
respectively •
1834,  August 23, No 9,677.....................$7,637 21
183i, May 2, No  837    .........................81,895 15
1835, June 23, No. 993  ....................  9,707 69
$39,240 05
"Mr Swartwout received these warrants under the an-
thoiitj of the second section of the act of the 27th of June,
1834, to make up an alleged deficiency m the fees and emol
uments ot his office to meet the compensation due to lus
clerks. Their receipt appears by his books, but the pio-
ceeds have never been debited in Ins eash account, and
their whole amount still remains entirely unaccounted for "
Now, sir, from uhence did Swartwout teceive
ese warrants' From the Secretary's Depart-
ment— fiom Washington!   The Secretary himself
knew that he had íeccived these wairants,, of
course. Swaitwout, it seems, did chmge hunic(f
with these wauants, as then receipt appeais by lus
books, but then pioceeds weie new i debited m
his casli account Now, sir, how could the Sec-
letaryfail to detect this deficit' Yet it appeals
to have continued fiom August23,1834, thiough
May and June, IbSo, up to .[November, 1838,
without a suspicion !
Again: Su, it appeals another item of deficit
was for "Jecs and emoluments of office over-
diawn:"
'* Cash was withdraw n for ihe alleged purpose of paving
the espouses of the otficc. bciond tneaclu U amount ot the e
expenses, as exmbiied bv Mr bwartwout's own accounts
and vouehei s 'I he aggregate ot tins excess is $60,291 42,

ter of 1815, and extended down to the last quarter of Ills
official term It is thus distributed through the several

§60 291 4"i  
Did not Mr Secretary know what should have
been the eouect chaigesfoi fees and emoluments'
This, it seems, peivaded thiee years, and was
nevei suspected until the defaulter had run away
with a million'

Here is the sum of §110,000, in tound num-
bers, abstiacted foi yeaus, which Mi Sccretaiy
must have known was embezzled, unless he was
blind in his eyes, or perfectly senseless in his ol-
factoiy nerves, yet he nevei suspected ' Sir, vigil-
ance in supei vising the accounts of Swartwout
would have detected,to a ccitainty, either one of
these deficits during the yeais 1834, 1835, 183G,
and 1837, and would have saved the sum of
$1,225,000, lost in March, 1838'
But, sir, I have been proving, so far, gioss neg-
lect only I will nowproceed to show something
woise thanZctc/ies in this case, on the part of Mr.
Secietary Woodbuiy.
On ptge 2 of his íeport, Mr. Secretaiy says:
"While Mr S remained collector, suspicions do not
seem to have been excited at the Department that be was
gud'y of any default "
Were suspicions excited anywhere else than at
the Department'    lie says, page 3:
" Subsequent disclosures [disclosures subsequent to
Price & letter of the 25th, which ought to have excited sus-
picions at the Depigment] made to the Department xn No-
vember, excited suspicions," &c.
Not until Novembci, then, three months after
Swatlwout's depaiture fiom the country, were sus-
picions excited at the Depaitment! Novemher 5,
1838, as soon as suspicions were excited, Ihe
Secretary wrote to theSohcitoi,Gilpin, inclosing
a memorandum from Hoyt, Swartwout's suc-
cessor, which memorandum is without a date, no
mention being made as to when it was communi-
cated, and is in the following words and figuies:

Gilpin is ordered, for the first time, to see
•whether there weie not mistakes m Swartwout's
holding over so large a balance in his hands to
cover his liabilities loi suits and protests. Incase
of defalcation, a distress warrant was sent. Gil-
pin and Barker both then pioceeded to New
York, and made two reports, one of November
8th, and one of November 15, 1838, and Gilpin
made two separate reports of the 10th and 13th
of November, ascertaining the facts of the defal-
cation as they now appear.
Now, sir, I should like to know when this
memoiandum of Hoyt was sent to the Secretaiy.
Why is it sent to us without date ? Was this sent
before November, when suspicions were fiist ex-
cited ' When did Hoyt know the seciet? It was
his memoiandnm, rnaik you, which stalled Gil-
pin with disnatches to New York, pumed them
November 5th, for the fiist time, with plenary
'poweis to catch a flying defaulter or seize his
effects.
Sir, the Secretary tells us, page 3:
"The circumstances which led to most of those diselo-
suri s transpired in the couise of preparing the first quar-
teily accounts ot Hoyt, the successoi, ioi settlement, and
the Department was hist indebted for thein, m agrcat meas-
ure, to his cm cotí.' 14£1Í1UCC "
Hoy t's cat eandvigilan.ee then caught the logue,
and the disclosures weie made in the course of
piepaiinghis/tniquaiterlyaccounts Maikthese
two facts, and beat them in mind. When did
Iloyt's/usí r/imito cxptie? He came into office
in Mai eh, 1838, his fiist quaiter expired in Julie '
How did suspicion sleep, then, until November 1
Moie than four months! Hoy t's second quaiter
had expned, it seems, before suspicions wore
awake; yet it was duiing the prepaiation of his
jirsi quaiter's accounts that the disclosuies were
made!
But again, sir. Swartwout's whole defalcation
amounts to $1,225,705 69: thepnncipal item being
his deficit on the "bond account," amounting to
$646,754 83. Gilpm and Baifecr, m their report
to the Secretaiy of the 15th of November, say:
" The remaining fund, the deficiency in winch makes up
the whole debt of Air Swartwout, is the bond account By
Mi. Swartwout's return to thoTreasuryDepartment, it ap-
pears that when his term of office expired he was chargeable
with $8,994,666 59 of bonds for dutiis not paid into the
Treasury Of these, he transferred to his successor, the
"present collector, ®b,045 386 13, constituting the portion ol
these bonds not yet due, or unpaid He also accounted for
a lurtber portion, amounting to 82,302,523 63, as having
been sent to the distnct attorney (or suit This leaves tha
sum of $646,754 83, being the aggregate of the deficit m Mr.
Su artwout's bond account On examination, we ascer-
tained tint of this aggregate the amounts that became due
weie as follows

Thus it appears, at the expiration of his term of office,
Swartwout was clnrgeable with..........$8,994,666 59
Ol the bonds constituting that sum, he trans-
ferred to Hoyt  .......§6,04)386 13

Leaving deficit .     ................   $646,754 83
Why did not Hoyt know then of this deficit on
the bond account as soon as the transfer was made
to him' He did know it, for see what Gilpin
says in lus report of November 10:
" All the abstracts, vouchers, and oth< r documents, re-
lating to the collector's account for the first qu irl< r of 183S,
(being the last of Mr Swartwout's term,) which h id nevei
been furnished, have been now transmitted to the First Aud-
itor. These documents, however, want tlic suiiiature ot
Mi Swartwout, though prepared by the officer who trans-
acted tint branch of Ins otiicnl business The cause of
their being thus incomplete appears to have been the desne
ot Mr Swartwout that they should not be furnished to the
accounting officers until lus return from abroad By that
time, according to the statements ol Mr. Ogden, he hoped
to be able to make arrangements for ihe settlement oi the
whole defalcation The want of them, however, delayed the
present collector in the completion ot lusownaecounts, as
it was necessary to include therein an accuiatc statement of
the balances in cash and uncollected bonds, handed over by
Mr Swartwout and that the same should aeree w ith the
final accounts of the latter, as rendered to the Treasuiy De-
partment. The urgentdemandfortius madeby the present
collector upon the officer h ivmg charge of these accounts,
and the difficulty ot obtaining it, first led to the suspicions
communicated by him to the Department, which were ren-
dered more certain by the subsequent examinations he im-
mediately instituted."
Here, it seems, Hoyt was first put upon the
scent. When ' When the transfer was made—
when he, of course, was, upon coming into office,
looking after what was to be transferred by his
predecessor. Yet we are still told there weie no
suspicions until November, 1838!
Again, sir, we are told by the repoit of Gilpin
and Barker, of November 15, that—
" When Mr Svvartn out's term expired, on the 28th March,
1838, .t appears, hy his own account, that he was charge
able with $201,096 40 of cash retamed to meet ' protests,'
and with $164,01.0 60 of cash 'deposited with him to meet
