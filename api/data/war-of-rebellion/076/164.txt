than half a mile in your front where the Roswell Factory road comes in on the left, by which road General McPherson's force, or part of it, may be expected. A road runs off to the right a mile from here, near Wade's house, following the ridge down between Island and Nancy's Creeks. Some rebel cavalry are on this road, which is a mere cross-road. Report any information you may get, either, as to roads or the enemy. I have not yet received definite orders as to the position the division shall assumed. Do not display more force than is necessary.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Colonel Reilly is about one mile and a half in front at the forks of the Atlanta and Cross Keys roads. The former leads along the ridge between Island and Nancy's Creeks, and unites with the one you are moving Hascall on at Burdett's, about three miles from Sandy Creek Camp-Ground, and a little more from Reilly. The road Cameron moved out on is only a plantation road. Some cavalry of the enemy are in Reilly's front on both roads, and some are seen in front of Cameron also. I have halted Reilly, ordering him to send smaller reconnaissances on both roads before him. The Roswell road comes in about a mile in front of him, but the best Roswell road is said to be that which comes in here. The triangle of roads from Burdett's is about two miles base on this road, three miles on your road, and three and a half or four from Reilly. This information is from a citizen here, who seems honest. No ones of McPherson.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Junction of Atlanta and Cross Keys Roads, July 17, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Our skirmishers have occupied the ridge on the other side of Nancy's Creek, as have General Dodge's also, connecting with ours. I have ordered Reilly to support the skirmishers with a regiment and hold the rest of his brigade in rear on this side, near the creek. The other two brigades I have stationed as I mentioned to you. An officer of General Hascall's staff came over from him and informed me that his position is where you left it,near the Pace's Ferry road, which he says runs into this Atlanta road, making the whole distance two miles and a half. I have ordered a regiment of Byrd's command to go out a mile and have a scouting party connect with General Hascall. My headquarters are a little beyond the forks on the left of the road.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
