HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,May 9, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD, Commanding:

GENERAL: General Van Dorn has moved his entire command forward, leaving no force in his works. I have ordered a regiment to occupy the works. There should be a battery of artillery there also, which, if you deem it proper, I request may be sent from the reserve.

Respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Corinth, Miss., May 9, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Near Corinth:

GENERAL: As there is a strong probability of Buell and Halleck arriving to-day on our left, we must not commit the error of exposing our flank to them. Hence, after driving back the enemy from Farmington, we had better, on account of the lateness of the hour, resume our positions in our lines, to await the movements of the enemy. Their fractions are too near together for us to be able to strike a great blow. Please indorse this and send it to Van Dorn, to whom you will communicate the order to fall back to his lines, or to the best position near them, at the proper moment.

Yours, truly,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Corinth, May 9, 1862.

Major General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Commanding Army of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: In case we have to retire from this position your army will follow the best road in the direction of Kossuth via the Female College, and when about 2 or 3 miles from that town a part of your forces, say one corps, will move to Danville, and another will go on the road to Kossuth until it meets the one to Rienzi, thence on to Booneville. The rest will continue on the road to Kossuth until it meets the road to Carrollville, when it will move on to the latter place.

Depots of provisions, &amp;c., have been made at Okolona and Columbus.

One of your division or corps can continue to Ripley, thence to Oxford, and thence to Grenada, for the protection of that depot. A stand will be made wherever practicable, destroying all bridges, to impede the movements of the enemy.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

Major Gen., EARL VAN DORN,

Commanding Army of the West, near Corinth, Miss.:
