[SIR:] A rebel force of cavalry and artillery, variously estimated at from 1,000 to 5,000, came around our right flank last evening, attacked and (Irove in a picket guard of two squadrons of cavalry stationed at Old Church; thence they proceeded to a landing 3 miles above White House, where they burned two forage schooners and destroyed some wagons. Then they struck the railroad at Tunstalls Station, fired into a train of cars, killing some 5 or 6. Here they met a force of infantry which I sent down to meet them, when they ran off. I have several cavalry detachments out after them and hope to punish them. No damage has been done to the railroad. GEG. B. MCCLELLAN, Major- General. Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War. No. 2.
