COMMISSARY DEPARTMENT, FIRST ARMY CORPS,

November 12, 1863.

Captain L. B. NORTON,

Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac:

It is with pleasure that I attest the great utility of the signal telegraph as used in this army under your direction. I recollect one instance where the line was more than twenty miles in length and where I transmitted messages by it with perfect success. Corps headquarters were at Guilford, and army headquarters at Fairfax at the time. The flags could not be used owing to dense woods and the want of positions, but the line worked like a charm. In my opinion it is of great benefit to the army as now conducted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. McCLURE,

Captain and Actg. Chief Commissary of Subsistence, First Corps.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,November 13, 1863.

I have frequently used the field telegraph lines of the Signal Corps of this army and have noticed the remarkable rapidity with which they have been run out, and that they are skillfully worked. I regard them as a very important auxiliary to the equipment of the Signal Corps and of great value to the service.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 13, 1863.

Captain L. B. NORTON,

Chief Signal Officer:

DEAR SIR: I should be very sorry to see the field telegraph separated from the Signal Corps as, I understand from you, is now proposed. I would prefer the consolidation of the magneto field and signal telegraph all under one head, as being the plan most certain to render each most efficient.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FIRST ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 13, 1863.

I take pleasure in saying that I am satisfied with the rapidity with which the telegraph lines run out by the Signal Corps of this army are established, and the skill displayed in operating them. I regard them as a valuable acquisition to the service, and important to the proper equipment of the Signal Corps.

JNO. C. ROBINSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding First Army Corps.
