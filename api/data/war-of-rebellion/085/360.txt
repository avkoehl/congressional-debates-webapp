General ROSECRANS:

The following has just received:

IRONDAL, September 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Mineral Point:

The scouts from Big River bridge have returned. They went in sight of Framington; saw forty rebels moving out on the Potosi road. Think from what they learned that there were 200 or 300 of them.

H. H. WILLIAMS,

Major, Commanding.

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

MINERAL POINT, September 25, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I am going to Irondale where are four stores, which the rebels from Farmington may send a force to take. My force here is now 400 and on bridges 200. I order from Do Soto one regiment more. There is now at De Soto four largest regiments of infantry and battery. I will open telegraph office at Irondale. Have you any advice or orders?

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

MINERAL POINT, September 25, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

A cavalry force operating from De Soto south would better develop the course of the rebel than Major Wilson can. I hear nothing new or of interest in any direction. Have ordered Wilson to push out his cavalry with more nerve.

THOS. EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

MINERAL POINT, September 25, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Nothing new. I will probably go back with the 400 infantry to De Soto or Pilot Knob to-night as information may lead me or your instructions or General Smith's direct. I am strongly inclined to think nearly the whole force of the rebels are heading toward Cape Girardeau and not toward this line, though I have no information to-day, except in dispatches from Lieutenant-Colonel Hiller and Major Wilson, forwarded to you from here by me.

THOS. EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, September 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Mineral Point:

Scouts just in report that in addition to Shelby's command that Marmaduke passed up Cedar Creek the same day with a force of 3,000 men, all moving in the direction of Fredericktown on parallel roads. It
