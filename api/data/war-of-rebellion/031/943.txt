Alexandria, while troops are sent from Fredericksburg either against Yorktown or Suffolk; it is believed the latter. Accounts differ as to intended point of attack, but agree in regard to movements of the enemy. The Upper Rappahannock seems to require your particular attention, unless the enemy should be so occupied as to prevent his crossing in force.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

Cannot General Cox, with about half of his forces in the Kanawha, be sent upon the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad? That line requires re-enforcements, and we have none to send from here without weakening General Burnside. Is there any danger of a raid into the Kanawha Valley at this season? Those here acquainted with the country say not.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Va.:

A body of rebels has appeared at Moorefield, South Branch of the Potomac. It is reported that troops from Richmond have been sent to reenforce Bragg in Tennessee. Doubtful. General Kelley thinks that a force is moving from Staunton into Western Virginia. Very probable.

January 4, 1863-2 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

I think my movements will prevent the enemy from making any raid upon Alexandria or Harper's Ferry. If you think it advisable, I will send General Sigel to you. I cannot move as quickly as I could have done before I was stopped in my last movement. It is known that the President telegraphed me, and I am surrounded with greater difficulties than before. I will do my best.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General, Commanding.
