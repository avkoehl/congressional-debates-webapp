RALEIGH, April 26, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

I have sent Colonel Holmes to take command of coast defenses, with full instructions. I regard the Cape Fear as perfectly secure. He can judge of that, however.

JOHN W. ELLIS.
HEADQUARTERS COAST DEFENSES,Wilmington, N. C., April 29, 1861.

Secretary WALKER:

Can you authorize the transfer from Norfolk navy-yard of twenty old pattern carronades, to be used for flank defense guns and against boats? Respectable merchants just from New York report the preparation of number of light steamers for North Carolina sounds. Carronades greatly needed. Plenty in Norfolk.

W. H. C. WHITING.

RICHMOND, April 29, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

I am instructed by the governor to say that some days since he furnished to an agent of Governor Ellis such ordnance as he asked for. Do you want the twenty [old] pattern carronades, in addition to what was sent governor of North Carolina, forwarded to Major Whiting at Wilmington?

S. BASSETT FRENCH,

Aide-de-Camp to Governor of Virginia.

RALEIGH, May 1, 1861.

JEFFERSON DAVIS:

Convention bill passed; also a resolution authorizing me to send troops to Virginia at once without limit. Our mint at Charlotte will coin for the Confederate Government if desired. Ships of war are hovering on our coast near the Cape Fear. Design unknown. I am preparing to manufacture percussion caps. Will succeed. More troops are offering than we can provide for.

JOHN W. ELLIS.

RALEIGH, May 17, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

I have already sent nine thousand five hundred muskets to Richmond. Cannot possibly spare more. Virginia has already more guns than men. North Carolina has not. I must beg of you to accept four regiments of twelve-months' men. They are now in camp. Two regiments are on their was to Richmond. Please answer.

JNO. W. ELLIS.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., May 17, 1861.

Gov. J. W. ELLIS,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Will take your four regiments. Please advise when they leave. Order them to Richmond without delay.

L. P. WALKER.
