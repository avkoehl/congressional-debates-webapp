Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the confidential communication relating to names of forts, &amp;c. The garrisons I have assigned to Forts M and N make one brigade, under General Baxter, about 1,400 strong. Fort M requires about the same force as Fort N. The outworks to it, which are very good, accommodating the men and the lines of defense and field of fire, give it about the same requirements for strength of garrison, although the interior space is considerably less. This is a fault in the trace of the work. This brigade might also furnish a little garrison for Fort O. I have removed the guns at Battery 31 into Fort N, which does the same work, and torn the battery down. As soon as this fort is finished (which it is now nearly) Battery Numbers 30 can be dispensed with; also Battery Numbers 27. Battery Numbers 29 is not located correctly on the map. I propose to rectify somewhat the line between Forts N and M when the parts we are now working on are completed, and in this way I think a I can make one battery do the work of 29 and 29; but before doing this I wish to finish an extensive slashing which I am now working on. The whole line, however, is in very good condition to trust to itself at once, should a sudden movement be necessary.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 22, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have the honor to report that no movement of the enemy worthy of notice has been observed and all has been quiet along our lines. The picket-line in our rear connects with the Second and Fifth Corps. The location will be changed somewhat to-day in order to straighten the line, and as soon as properly located the line will be strengthened by slashing, &c.
