CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT, Montgomery, May 25, 1861.

His Excellency JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Governor of Georgia, Milledgeville:

SIR: Understanding your resolution not to permit any troops in Georgia now armed by you to leave that State with their arms, and the immediate necessities of the public service requiring troops that are armed, while this Department has but a limited supply of muskets at its disposal, I have to say to Your Excellency that all the regiments you will present armed and equipped will be received into the Confederate service for twelve months, although it is highly desirable they should be enrolled for the war. I trust Your Excellency, with your usual promptness of action, will respond to this overture.

Respectfully,

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, May 25, 1861.

Governor THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans:

How many regiments for the war can you arm and equip, and if not for the war for twelve months?

L. P. WALKER.

NEW ORLEANS, May 25, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

I have three regiments for the war. My twelve-months' companies were disbanded yesterday. Let me know how many twelve-months' regiments you want. I may be able to stop my disbanded companies. Call on me for twelve-months' men-one, two, or three regiments, if you want that many. Whatever I can furnish I will. I am sure I can furnish three, unless the men are so demoralized by the necessity I was under to disband them that they may refuse to go; but call for what you want. Answer immediately.

THO. O. MOORE.

MONTGOMERY, May 25, 1861.

Governor THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans:

I am much obliged for the three regiments for the war. Will take any number armed and equipped for twelve months. Want of arms necessitates this change. Troops for the war you will order to Richmond as fast as they are mustered into the service. I leave for Richmond Monday night.

L. P. WALKER.
