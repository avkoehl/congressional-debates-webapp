P. S.-There are at Cowan nearly 1,200 convalescents of the Army of the Cumberland. Most of them I am informed, fit for duty; but 150 armed. I shall order Colonel Ross to make a special report in the case. These men should be sent to their regiments. They are of no use at Cowan, and I imagine are suffering for discipline and drill.
