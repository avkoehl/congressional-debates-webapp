spectacle of war and carnage which this continent has, for the last three years, exhibited to the eyes of afflicted humanity, deem the present a fitting occasion to declare the principles, the sentiments, and the purposes by which they have been, and are still, actuated. They have ever deplored the necessity which constrained them to take up arms in defense of their rights and of the free institutions derived from their ancestors; and there is nothing they more ardently desire than peace, whensoever their enemy, by ceasing from the unhallowed war waged upon them, shall permit them to enjoy in peace the sheltering protection of those hereditary rights and of those cherished institutions.

The series of successes with whit it has pleased Almighty God, in so signal a manner, to bless our arms on almost every point of our invaded borders since the opening of the present campaign, enables us to profess this desire of peace in the interests of civilization and humaner of having our motives misinterpreted, or of the declaration being ascribed to any unmanly sentiment, or any distrust of our ability fully to maintain our cause. The repeated and disastrous checks foreshadowing ultimate discomfiture, which their gigantic Army, directed against the Capital of the Confederacy, has already met with, are but a continuation of the same providential successes for us. We do not refer to these success in any spirit of vain boasting, but in humble acknowledgment of that Almighty protection which has vouchsafed and granted them.

The world must now see that eight millions of people, inhabiting so extensive a territory, with such varied resources, and such numerous facilities for defense as the benignant bounty of nature has bestowed upon us and animated with one spirit to encounter every privation and sacrifice of ease, of health, of property, of life, rather than be degraded from the condition of free and independent States into which they were born, can never be conquered. Will not our adversaries themselves begin to feel that humanity has bled long enough, that tears and blood and treasure enough have been expended in a bootless undertaking, covering their own land, no less than ours, with a pall of mourning, and exposing them far more than ourselves to the catastrophe of financial exhaustion and bankruptcy, not to speak of the loss of their liberties by the despotism engendered in an aggressive warfare upon the liberties by the despotism engendered in an aggressive warfare upon the liberties of another and kindred people? Will they be willing, by a longer perseverance in a wanton and hopeless contest, to make this continent, which they so long boasted to be the chosen abode of liberty and self-government, of peace and a higher civilization, the theater of the most causeless and prodigal effusion of blood which the world has ever seen, of a virtual relapse into the barbarism of the ruder ages, and of the destruction of constitutional freedom by the lawlessness of usurped power? These are questions which our adversaries will decide for themselves. We desire to stand acquitted, before the tribunal of the worlds, as well as in the eyes of Omniscient justice, of any responsibility for the origin or prolongation of a war as contrary to the spirit of the age as to the traditions and acknowledged maxims of the political system of America. On this continent, whatever opinions may have prevailed elsewhere, it has ever been held and acknowledged by all parties, that government, to be lawful, must be founded on the consent of the governed. We were forced to dissolve our federal connection with our former associates by their aggressions on the fundamental principles of our compact of union with them, and, in doing so, we exercised a right consecrated in
