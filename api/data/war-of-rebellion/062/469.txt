FORT LARAMIE, February 29, 1864.

Colonel J. M. CHIVINGTON:

Colonel Collins had the opportunity of arresting or notifying those parties previous to their leaving the agency. I notified the colonel that they were lawfully licensed traders and were going to start out; asked him if he had any orders to give them; said not. I notified the traders accordingly. The Indians are all quiet and well disposed toward the whites at the points where the traders were going, and need small quantities of ammunition for small game. The traders, under my advice, have taken but a small proportion of ammunition to the amount of goods they have. The traders' invoices filed at the Indian Department call for double the amount I allowed them to take out, I knowing nothing of Order Numbers 29. There not being any condemned provisions at the post, and not having any provisions of my own, the Indians must necessarily have some ammunition, or will soon be in suffering condition. I know of no other way of supplying their wants. Should you know, please make the suggestion. I respectfully ask the discharge of the parties.

JOHN LOREE,

U. S. Indian Agent.
