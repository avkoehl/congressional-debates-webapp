FORT HAMILTON, New York Harbor, February 17, 1862.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

SIR: Inclosed you will receive papers containing information ordered by you in your letter of the 13th instant. I had but little else to guide me own judgment in designating those prisoners who were not prisoners of war. The lists may therefore want more or less correction at the Department of State. There are now (assumed by me) at Fort Lafayette 112 prisoners of war and 51 prisoners other than prisoners of war; total, 163. It will be seen that there were no prisoners at Fort Lafayette until the 22nd of July, 1861, There have been no prisoners of war or state kept at Fort Hamilton. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
