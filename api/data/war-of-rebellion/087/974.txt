Major-General BUTLER,

Fortress Monroe:

Richmond papers of the 10th show that on the 7th Sherman was east of the Ogeechee, and within twenty-five miles of Savannah, having marched eighteen the day before. If you do not get off immediately you will lose the chance of surprise and weak garrison.

What is the prospect for getting your expedition started? It is a great pity we were not ten or twelve days earlier. I am confident it would then have been successful. Have you heard from Palmer? The Richmond papers give no account of any Federals on the Roanoke or Weldon road south of Weldon.
