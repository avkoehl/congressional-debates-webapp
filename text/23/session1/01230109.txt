THE PENSION IAH¡>.
The íesolution submitted by Mi Chilton, to
appoint a select committee to inquiie into the ex-
pediency of so extending the general pension law
os to embrace within its provis ons those peisons
who were engaged in the Indian wars down to
1794, with the amendments thereto submitted by
Mr. Bouldin, to appoint a committee to inquire
into the moral effects of the pension system,
comirg up as the unfinished business—
Mr ALLEN, of Virginia, rose and advocated
the ougmal resolution submitted by Mr. CpiL-
ton The pension system having been established,
he thought equal justice required that those per-
sons embraced under the resolution of Mr C were
as fully entitled to participate in its benefits as
many others who had been placed upon the roll
The íesolution, at all events, being only for m-
qun y, whether a class of citizens who had encoun-
tered many dangers m the service of their country,
shou'd have any claims to it, it was with much
regiet h° observed that his colleague [Mr. B ] had
embairassed the resolution with the amendment
proposed by him. Had that gentleman proposed
his amendment as a distinct proposition, as it was
the right of every representative to have the policy
of the laws discussed, he would not have objected
to it, although he could not concur with him in the
propriety of abandoning the pension bystem, which
he took for granted, the nation having after due
consideration established, they would not now
retrace their steps The inquiry proposed by his
colleague went to establish a new principle of
legislation, which, if once sanctioned, it would be-
come as necessary to have the same inquiry made
into the moral effects of all the laws heretofore
passed, or to be passed, or they may as well be
dispensed with.
It was doubtless true there were abuses on the
Eension system, as there would be on any other,
ut the Congiess which adopted it must have been
aware of the abuses to winch this, in common
with any other law, was liable, and they preferred
risking that lather than leave what toey consid-
ered just claims on the country undischarged He
did not agree with the opinion of the member from
Rhode Island, [Mr Bukges,] who objected to the
inquiry on the ground " that pensions had been
' gianted on account of the justness of the claims
'which the applicants had upon the nation, as
' arising from the circumstance that they had been
' paid for their services in a depreciated currency,
1 and therefore had not received that which the
'Government ought to have paid " For if this
was so, he asked, how it happened that there was
as much paid to those who served only twelve
months as to those who served a longer period?
If that gentleman's principle was correct, it would
follow that the pensions ought to be in proportion
to the time of service, and it it was a payment ac-
tually due as a debt, it would be deciding that
there was still a larger proportion who were en-
tit'cd to it, if we regarded the national fauh or
common honesty, viz tnose, or rather the hens
of those who had since depaited this life, equal
jus ice required, if this construction was to be put
on the quesuon, that the principle should be so
cai ned out He, howevei, thought that the piin-
ciple upon which the pension system was founded
had been more correctly laid down by the gentle-
man from Kentucky, [Mr C ,] that it was not
stnctly so much an act of jus'ice, as it was an ap-
peal to the nation, and who chose in this way to
testify their gratitude, and thus evince to the world
the nation'b deep sense of the services of those
coming under its pious ons
The member fiom Rhode Island was not ]usti-
iied in term ng the conflicts had with the Ind ana
on the" iiontiers ''as a mere p*-fcdatoiy warfare
from tune to time," for it wm i continual wai,
kept up with tnem dowi to 1794, aid undei cir-
cumstances which conferred upon the people en-
gaged m it the strongest possible claims tQ the relief
now sought for. It would be recollected by those
conversant with the his'ory of those times, that
the Indian frontiers weie m a state of comparative
quiet, after the treaty made in 1765, with Hie In-
dians, by Su W Johnson, and that qu et remained
uiitU 1774, when the tea was destioyed in Boston
But alter the occurrences of that day, the Regal
Government instigated (hese fiontier Indi ins to
commit hostilities, doubtless to di\ert and distract
the attention with which the Commonwealth of
Virginia viewed the enci oachments of the Govern-
ment, and prevent the measui es which they had
undertaken, in concert with the Confederacy.
This, according to the traditionary histoiy of the
country, was the motive in which the Dunmoie
campaign originated; and notwithstanding the
treaty wi'h Great Britain, by which our mde
pendencewas acknowledged, these hostilities con-
tinued on the frontiers down to the treaty of Gren-
ville, in 1795, the period to which the proposed
inquiry is limited. This inquiiy was sought, as
by the present law it was«ecessary that the ap-
plicants, under its provisions, should have been
emolled for six months, but it happened that
scarcely any of these were enrolled at all, the
State of Virginia, then, as well known, had an
extensive frontier to the west, and she wisely
determined not to call upon the inhabitants scat
tered over that part for their services to be enrolled
along with the others whom she sent to join the
confederate force, preferring to leave the care of
the frontier settlements to them, and well did they
take care of them, every field was tilled by them
with the rifle by their side. Every block-house
was afoitressto impede the incursions of the sav-
ages Under such circumstances, he contended,
they were entitled equally with others as coming
within the spmt if not the letter of the law, which
gave the rewards of the nation to others for ser-
vices during the revolutionary war. Mr. A. went
at length into the history of the war, and contended
that it was by the exertions of the frontier men,
with a detachment under the command of Rogers
Clark, a great and valuable domain in the West,
which was now possessed by the several States,
had been acquired, and for which they never
had leceived any pioportion of the bounty which
had been given to others He therefore trusted
that Congress, considering they had not been
heretofore importunate beggais knocking at
their doors, would consider them, under all the
circumstances detailed, as entitled to participate
in it even at this late hour Mr A then con-
cluded fby expressing his hopes that the amend-
ment of his colleague [Mr Bolldim) would not
prevail
Mr PEYTON rose, and indignantly repelled
(as he was understood by the reporter) some ex-
pressions used on the previous day by the honor-
able member from Rhode Island. He denied that
the persons engaged in these Indian wars, as
termed, were "merely bands of armed plunder-
ers," and insisted that it was owing to their in-
trepidity and daring in penetrating into the west-
ern forests in pursuit of the Indians that the quiet
subsequently enjoyed, and the public lands, now
the object of so much desire, had been seemed
He eulogized the leadeis of various detachments
in these conflicts, and pirticularly the exertions
of Boon, Wickliffe, and Lewis The histoiyof
Robinson and his warlike deeds would fill a vol-
ume He had been to Vngmia what Boon had
been to Kentucky, the pioneer of the West
Spencer, too, was a mme which would have lm-
peribhable íenown He had been the pilot of all
the&e daring bands for yeais, until at length he
fell, gallantly fell, ooveied with wounds, and his
flesh, with that of many of his gallant compan-
ions, devoured by the wolves No monument had
yet been i aised by the nation for such services, but
nature had raised a prouder monument to his tame
than man could raise It stood in the fai West,
he gave a name to a bill which wou d last to all time
Even the women in those times aided their hus-
bands, casting bullets and supplying them for their
conflicts with means to outam victory over thesav-
a«-es, whilst the tomahawk was uplifted over their
heads And thus, as they had all contributed their
share of seivices to secare the benefits of civihzi-
tion to ti e coumry, he hoped they would be pei-
mitted to enjoy some share ol the common boun'y
Thedebatewas cut off a'one o'clock, in accoid-
ance with the íesolution adopted on the 14th in-
stant, and the House proceeded to the ordeis of
the day, being the
RrMOVAL Or THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
motion to íefer the íeport of the Secietary of the
Tieisuiyon the deposites to the Committee of
Ways and Means, the question  being on the
amendment submitted by Mr. Jones, as an amend-
ment to that previously submitted by Mr. McDuf-
fie, viz: to add to the motion for reference the
following instructions to that committee: "Inquire
' into the expediency of depositing the revenue
' hereafter collected in the State banks in thediffer-
' ent States where the same is col!eeted,in propor-
' tion to their respective capitals paid in, and to
' prescribe the terms on which the same shall be
' deposited, and to report by bill or otherwise "
Mi. BE ARDSLEY, of New York, commenced
his remarks bv adverting to the posture in which
the United States Bank now stood before us. The
bank had gathered a golden harvest from the ex-
clusive use which, for many years,it had enjoyed
of the public money, and it was never to have
been expected that it would use, on any occasion,
all its efforts to prostrate the interests of the coun-
try. The tranifer of the deposites to other banks
mcieased the ability of those banks to the same
extent thatit diminished the resources of the United
States Bank It was to be expected some tempo-
rary and inconsiderable derangement of the usual
tiain of bank business would have been the con-
sequence of the removal, but, if all had acted with
a view to the general good, no serious disaster
would have occurred. The removal of the depos-
ites was an act unquestionably legal and valid. The
expediency of the measure wasa distinct question,
and onewhich thebank had no right to judge upon
under any circumstances. But the measure had
been met by the bank with a general and oppres-
sive system of retaliation. He believed that the
effect of those measures had fallen short of their
object The whole fury of the institution had been
poured out upon the devoted heads of citizens of
the sea-board Where men congregate in cities
they are easily brought to move in masses, and
any derangement of the currency is immediately
and generally felt. The bank, with cool delibera-
tion and design, set about the production of the
greatest possible amount of distress and embarrass-
ment, and its whole coercive energies had been
applied to the object with a considerable degree of
success. A diffei ent course would have gained to
the bank many friends from among those who had
been enemies But the couiseadopted by thebank
bore equally upon fuends and enemies; it was
prosecuted with a view to coerce a'l to the support
of us own views. The pressure having now some-
what subsided, and the cities which were lately
wiithmg under its effects, being now restored toa
comfortab'e condition, it remains for us to do our
duty. We have seen that the credit of oui local
institutions is based on a safe foundation,and that
public confidence in them cannot be easily shaken.
Letus go forwaid and do our duty, remembering
that " the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the
church," and complete byiiur success the entire
overthiow of this dangerous institution.
For two months previous to the meeting of Con-
gress it was notorious that the deposites were
removed from the bank to the State institutions.
The Secietary, not sheltering himself under the
authority of the President, had officially announced
the act a=> his own, but the truth of his annuncia-
tion is disputed It has been chaiged here in de-
bate that the President did the act through the
Secretaiy, who was the passive instrument of his
tyranny, and to enable him to gratify his icvenge
against the bank he had hurled" the foimer Secre-
taiy of the Treasui y from office To the=e charges
he should look somewhat in detail. In fairness to
theoffirer, so fai as he was peisonally conceired,
we ought to consider the act asdone by him. This
was required in jus ice to the Secietary, but, m
íefeience to the act itself, was wholly unessential.
It was proper also to adveit to the fact, that before
the present Secretary came into the Depaitment,
his views on this subject were known to corre-
spond with those of U e Piesident If he undei-
stood thecharacter of the Secretaiy, he was nota
man to be driven from bis purpose This repoit
was a monument of the vigor of his understanding.
His disinterestedness was shown m the acceptance
of an office which he knew he must hold at t'ie
pleasme of his political foes, while he gave up an
office which he held upon a tenuie as permanent
as the peisonal regard and confidence of a friend.
As to the lemoval of the former Secretary, he
would take leave to deny that he had been dis-
missed because he refused to transfer the depositee.
