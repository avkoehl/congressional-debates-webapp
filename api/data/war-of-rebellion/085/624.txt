KANSAS CITY, October 4, 1864.

Major C. S. CHARLOT:

I can get no reliable information as to Price. Small parties of bushwhackers are traveling through this and Cass County. My new horses will be shod and issued to-day. Shall move south in the morning, leaving two companies here and same number at Independence, but they will be ready to move at any time your order.

FORD,

Colonel.

INDEPENDENCE, MO., October 4, 1864.

Major C. S. CHARLOT:

Have sent scouts from here east and south, also sent from Pleasant Hill east and south, to give all information possible. Raining very hard. Shall probably move to-morrow.

FORD,

Colonel.

KANSAS CITY, October 4, 1864.

Major CHARLOT:

We have not Government stores at Independence. Had I not better take all troops from that station when I move south? Shall leave two companies at this station under Major Pritchard.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 4, 1864.

Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

Dispatch received. Be prepared to move without leaving stores, except at Kansas City. That place must be held if possible. You are my advance picket as to Price; I am not disposed to move you back or south at present, but may support you if Price approaches. Operator at Sedalia reports Price at Rolla. This is doubtful. If true, he is moving south. Keep me posted.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 4, 1864.

Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

Dispatches received. Bushwhackers and Price are now our most formidable foes. I must have information from below you. You must send out scouts and spies. Also try to get telegraph news through General Brown's headquarters. If raining, as it does here, you better not move to-day.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
