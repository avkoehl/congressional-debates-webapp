the command from New Berne, N. C. The campaign developed so rapidly, however, as to demonstrate the inutility of such a movement. The result would have been to discontinue the only regular means of communication between New Berne and its outposts and to call a supernumerary force to Wilmington some days after the successful termination of the campaign. The signal stations in operation within the department limits upon the 16th of February, 1865, were as follows: At New Berne, N. C., and its outposts, under the command of First Lieutenant Joseph B. Knox, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, connecting New Berne, Fort Anderson, Fort Totten, Camp Palmer, Batchelder's Creek, Neuse Road, Beech Grove, and Red House. (See Appendix A. *) On steamer Spaulding and adjacent points, under the command of Second Lieuts. E. A. Briggs and F. E. Beardslee, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, connecting department headquarters, Major-General Terry's headquarters, Admiral Porter's flagship Malvern, headquarters Brigadier-General Paine, headquarters Brevet Brigadier-General Abbott, Fort Buchanan, Smithville, and the U. S. steamer Keystone State. (See Appendix B, Stations Nos. 1 to 8.) On the morning of February 17 the troops of Major General J. D. Cox, U. S. Volunteers, moved up the west bank of the Cape Fear River, threatening Fort Anderson, then in possession of the rebels. In the afternoon of that day the steamer Spaulding moved over the bar at Federal Point into the Cape Fear River, anchoring nearly opposite the headquarters of Major-General Terry, U. S. Volunteers, upon the east bank. (See Appendix B, Station Numbers 9.) In the meantime the Smithville station, occupied by Lieutenant Ketchum, was moved to the house occupied by Major General J. D. Cox, two miles below Fort Anderson, upon the west bank, and communication was reopened with that officer. (See Appendix B, Station Numbers 10.) Communication was continued between other points as before. Upon the 18th instant Lieutenant Ketchum moved his station to a point upon the river bank as near the skirmish line fronting Fort Anderson as would permit communication between the troops of Major-General Cox, the steamer Spaulding, the fleet of Admiral Porter, and the troops of Major-General Terry upon the east bank. (See Appendix B, Station Numbers 11.) Instructions were sent to the officers signaling upon the east bank of the river to observe and report as accurately as possible the effect and range of the shells thrown at Fort Anderson by the fleet. Communication between other points was continued as before. During the night Sergt. Alfred B. Harris, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, while bearing dispatches from the station of Lieutenant Ketchum to Colonel O. H. Moore, commanding the skirmish line, was captured by the enemy. Fortunately no papers or information of importance were taken with him. Early upon the morning of February 19, the force of Colonel Moore occupied Fort Anderson, the enemy having evacuated that post during the previous night. The station of Lieutenant Ketchum was moved to the fort. (See Appendix B, Station Numbers 12.) Upon receiving a message from Lieutenant Ketchum, announcing the occupation of the fort, the fleet of Admiral Porter moved up the river, followed by the steamer Spaulding, to a point opposite, whence communication was continued as before. (See Appendix B, Station Numbers 13.) The enemy having also abandoned the lines in front of General Terry, the station on the beach upon the right of the lines of Brevet
