General SHEPLEY:

Following dispatch has been received from West Point, June 4, to George D. Sheldon, manager telegraph line:

I have guards stationed day and night at each end of the cable. There are 38 miles line from here to Gloucester Point. It will require 50 mounted men to patrol line properly. There are 20 here now. The balance had better come over line to this point and report to Lieutenant McGee, and he will station them so that they can go over every part of the line each day, and have 10 men in reserve at each end for escort to repairers.

WM. MacINTOSH,

I would recommend that the disposition of the forces asked for be made.
