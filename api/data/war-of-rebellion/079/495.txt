The pickets left behind can join you at that point.

COLONEL: By direction of Major-General Osterhaus I have the honor to report that the Fifteenth Corps obtained possession of the bridge across Coosa River at 3. 30 p. m. The head of the column arrived at a point one mile beyond the fork of the road on the Jacksonville road, and six miles from Cedar Bluff, about dark, where the corps will encamp. It has been detained greatly by the train of the Seventeenth Army Corps. General Osterhaus has remained at the bridge until the column crosses, when he expects to see it effectually destroyed.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

General John E. SMITH, Cartersville, Ga.:

I will send general Schofield's corps to Resaca from here to- morrow, and it will relieve all your men at Adairsville and above. you will then collect your DIVISION at Kingston and Cartersville ready to move. I must here await for the development of Hood. I think Thomas will have enough men to handle him, even if he succeeds in crossing the Tennessee.

Major-General, Commanding.
