HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Hodges, March 17, 1865 - 7 a. m.

Lieutenant HARDEE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that after crossing the river I moved out six miles on the Smithfield road, and went into camp. I have sent scouts to Draughan's Cross-Roads, and to all the points on the river until it gets as low as the point at which it is intersecred by Mingo Creek. None of these scouts have as yet reported.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, on Smithfield Road, March 17, 1865 - 11. 15 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that the enemy's cavalry have made their appearance in my front on this road; force not yet ascertained. I am moving down to meet them. I am about twenty miles from Smithfield, on the new Cut road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, March 17, 1865 - 2. 30 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to say that an officer from my picket, which is four miles from the bridge near which I crossed last night on this road, reports that he saw men with knapsacks, but I am of opinion that the force which has been skirmishing with my picket there are all mounted - perhaps mounted infantry. Firing having been heard in direction of the bridge where the Averasborough and Smithfield road crosses Black River, I shall retire my main body on this road, so as to prevent the enemy gaining my rear in the event of his crossing at that bridge, but shall leave my picket in its present position.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
