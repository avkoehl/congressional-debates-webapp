whom the debt had been contracted, and to that he appealed.
After some furthei forcible lemarks on the above, Mr E
proceeded to examine the report of the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, with a view of t-howing that theie wab no correct data
wherpon to found this bill for a loan of twelve millions He
showM from the report it^e'f, after coirectmg the errors it
contained, that on the first of January next there would not be
a dpficiei cy of more thin ©1,249 806
With a view of showing the peculiar management of the Se-
cre'irym making out the alleged deficiency, Mr E showed
that theie were sums, amounting m all to #215,151, to which the
feecietary had made no allusion at all, and which might be
made subject to his draft, if he chese to make it He argued
that that ofheei had also underestimated the receipts from
bank-- $d50,000, and likewise from customs and lands, at least
SI ^00 000, which m reality, would show a balance in favor
of the Tieasur} on the 1st of January, 1S12, of $615,294 39 He
contended that this was one only of a system of measures
whHi ihe pie^ent Administration would bring forward, and
which, if they ¡should succeed in chartering a National Bank,
would plunge the countiy m debt to the amount of thirty mil-
lions He concluded with expressing a hope that the people
would set then eyes open and ri^e m their majesty and put
down theseattemt t^ to embarrass them and impose upon the
country a national debt, a National Bank, and other schemes
ol hk   character
