General B. F. KELLEY, Harper's Ferry:

Scammon and Roberts report a rebel regiment moving from Lewisburg to the east of Summerville, and five regiments of their cavalry and two of infantry in the neighborhood of Crab Bottom. I do not believe they have any such strength. I can send no re-enforcements to Roberts, who is asking for more cavalry and artillery. You must support, him, as far as practicable, from the railroad, and give instructions to Colonel Wilkinson, at Clarksburg, accordingly. Keep up communication with Roberts.

General B. F. KELLEY, Harper's Ferry:

When Hooker moves, milroy will go up the Valley with his division supported by all you can spare. Get your troops at Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg immediately in condition to be held ready for such orders, looking also to ammunition and supplies of every kind. Send in advance immediately Captain Alexander's battery, Baltimore artillery, to report for duty to General Milroy. The battery is not transferred however, and will continue to make returns through General Kenly to you.

Major-General MILROY, Winchester, Va.:

When General Hooker moves, which will be soon, you will be instructed to move up the Valley with all your force, supported by as many as can be spared from Harper's Ferry, leaving of your troops only enough to make care of your rear and keep open your line of supplies. Make yourself ready immediately in all respects, and have your troops in the best condition for such orders.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,
