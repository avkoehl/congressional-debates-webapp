occasioned to honest contractors who could not
afford to wait so long for their pay. It was
on account of this inconvenience, and as I un-
derstand with the concurrence of the Indian
peace commission, whose great and benefi-
cent duties are continued, that the law was
changed so that the examination of the ac-
counts is no longer a prerequisite to payment.
Mr. NIBLACK rose. '
Mr. SARGENT. Gentlemen interested in â– 
the business of the Committee of Claims insist
that I must close this matter up, and I have
the strongest desire to do so. I will, how-
ever, yield to the gentleman from Indiana
[Mr. niblack] for an inquiry, and then I
shall call the previous question.
Mr. NIBLACK. Since the question of the
expense of supporting the Indians and deal-
ing with them is now before the House, I
would like very much to hear from the gen-
tleman from California [Mr. Sargent] a state-
ment of his estimate of the number of Indians
now in the United States of whom the Gov-
ernment has charge. I think the number i?
greatly overestimated.
Mr. SARGENT. I think the number of
Indians of whom the Government has charge,
outside of Alaska, is about one hundred and
ninety thousand. That is the outside limit.
Mr. NIBLACK. It is usually estimated at
three hundred thousand.
Mr. SARGENT. That estimate is an ex-
aggeration.
Mr. NIBLACK. My own belief has been
that the number does not exceed one hundred
and fifty thousand; but the gentleman is better
informed than I am.
Mr. SARGENT. I now demand the pre-
vious question.
The previous question was seconded and
the main question ordered; and under the
operation thereof the report of the committee
of conference was adopted.
Mr. SARGENT moved to reconsider the
vote by which the report was adopted ; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
