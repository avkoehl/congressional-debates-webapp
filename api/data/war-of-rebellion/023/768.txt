brilliant dash upon a superior force of the enemy, resulting in their utter discomfiture and the capture of 123 prisoners. The judgment and prudence of the previous dispositions exhibit high military skill. The vigor and boldness of the attack is a striking example of the spirit that now animates our cavalry and which is fast making them the terror of our invaders.

I find the country hereabouts almost completely drained of supplies, and I gather from my best sources of information that the enemy [some 7,000 strong] occupies Cumberland Gap, and has rendered it quite impregnable, at least to the force I have.
