COHGRESSIOKAt GLOM.                                         163
Mr Wise     Of half a vote     (A laugh )
Mr A I have no disposition to contest the
right of Messrs Ghols n and Ci ubjkne to re-
present the people of Mississippi (or the whole oi
the Twenty-fifth Congress, when not one of the
people of Mississippi voted for them with any
such intention. Nor do I object to their íeceiving
their pay I desire not to be understood as ob
jectmg, in the slightest manner, to their receiving
their iull pay to the last cent But I call upon
this House (if I am to call m vain upon the gentle-
man from Georgia) to point out the distinction on
which these individuals shall receive it, and the
other  not, who, I say, are as legally the represen-
tatives in this House of the State of Mississippi,
as I am a representative of the State of Massachu-
setts, with this simple difference, that I was admit-
ted without the production or exhibition of any
credentials at all, and these gentlemen did produce
and exhibit full credentials, in due and authentic
fcrm The gentleman, it is plain, rests on the de-
cision of this House that is, upon the election, by
this House, of persons to represent the people of
Mississippi, and I understand tne gentleman,
(though he did not now say so in express womIs,)
from the tenor of his argument w hen this question
«as under discussion before, that the House, being
the judge of the election qualification and returns
of its own members, possesses an unlimited, un-
qualified, unbounded power to admit whom it
pleases, within these walls, whether elected by the
people of a State or not
[The Chair here interposed, and reminded Mr
Adams that the question having been decided yes-
terdaj, was not now open to debate, and that it
would not be in order to answer, now, arguments
which «ere uiged then ]
Mr A resumed Suppose, then, that the gentle-
man from Georgia has given as hi  reason lor
opposing this resolution that the House has powi r
to decide as it pleases, and having decided tor
Messrs Gholson and Clubornj, they art entitled
to their piy, while those «ho were duly cleeted,
but excluded by the fluu>e, are i ot eutiiltd 1
suppose that he holds that until tht decision ot the
3d of October was rescinded, it was binding ot
every man, woman and child m Mississippi and m
the Tinned States     I hold the íeveise
[Heie the Chair again interposed, and reminded
Mr A as beloie, that this question was not now
open to argument ]
Mr. A Well, I will endeavor to keep within
the pale of oidet as well as I c in I ask, why aie
not Messrs. Prentiss and Word entitled to their
pay1 The gentleman from Georgia says because
by a decision ot the House they have not been íe-
cetved as members, while the othcis hive
Mr DAWSON here again explained Uiulei
the Constitution members alone were to receive
compensation the House had eleclaied Messrs
Prentiss and Word not to be members, andtheie-
fore he cou'd not vote to pay them
Mr ADAMS Yes, I still undeisland that he
adhetes to the decision of this House, admitting
Messrs' Ghoison and Claisorm , as the íeason
why they are entitled to their pay, although that
resolution was rescinded, and the House has de-
clared that Ghoi son and Claibornp are not, and
of course never were, members ot this House
Now, I say, that if the resolution of the 3d cl Octo-
ber, declanng them membeis, was a nullity, 'I was
a nullity so lar as to destroy their claim to pay I
1< ok lor an equitable distinction (theie can be none
other) betu een the cases, an equitable reas >n wh)
one shou'd get the pa) and the othei not.
As to whether the gen lemen from M ssrsippi
will receive the mone) , or not, that is not a ques
Hon for this House, it is no question for my con
sideration, that is tneir own afiair What I hai e
to consider is, whether these gentlemen are entitled
to receive it, after they have come up here, sent by
the people of Mississippi, under every provision of
the Constitution and ol the laws, and this House
has refused to admit them1 It would surely be the
most extraordinary thing m the world, if compen-
sation for tneir txpenses and lime, in fulfillm< the
will of the people of their State, shall be refused
.^them, while it is allowed to those -whom this Hojse
has pronounced not to be the Representatives of
the State of Mississippi.
Mr BOULDIN ^aid he should vote to pay both
parties. Whose rights, he asked, were in contro-
veisy1 The lights of the people of the United
Slates, and especially of the State of Mississippi.
At whose expense was this question to be contested'
Surely at the expense of the people If the ques-
tion was of so doubtful a complexion that it was
decided but by a majority of one vole, and the peo-
p'e were contending for their rights, (they asked no
more) the expense of testing those rights ought to
be paid for at the expense of the contendéis, namely,
the people Through whom could they contend,
if not through the candidates for seats here' But if
these candidates were to be saddled with their own
expenses, who would be found willing to run the
risk1 Some gentlemen had asked, was the House
to pay the expenses of any persons that chose to
come here, and claim a seat! Certainly not But
here was a case where the claims were so fair on
both sides, and so evenly balanced, that the matter
was decided by a baie majority of one, (or, as his
colleague said, half a one ) As to the pride of the
gentlemen from Mississippi Mi B trusted in God
that none of the parties would have any pride
about the mattei, sive in contending for the ryhts
eif the people of Mississippi But, pride or no
pride, he h >ped they would be piid One set of
claimants certainly had the form, hut ltwas j.ist as
clear to him that the other set had the substance
His vote had gone for the substance But he woujd
never vote to compel them to pay their own ex-
penses.
Mi WI^E here offered an amendment pro-
viding tint Conguss should pay the people of Mis-
sissippi the expenses of an rlretion which h.'d been
caused by tht error of that House
He then, to prevent misunderstanding, and ob-
viate the idea that he meant to be ¡il-'iauued to the
Speakei, explained vvhnt he had rnemtbysa\ lit;
tint the question last mt,ht liad bien <1< tidul by

tion on the table, relative to the Northeastern bejun
dary, and the arrest and imprisonment of a citizea
of Mame by the British authorities, which had been,
postponed some days ago, and had not yet been
acted upon He would not, at so late an hour of
the day, ask for its consideration, but gave notice
that to-morrow, at 1 o'clock, when it would be in
order, and would have precedence in the orders oí
the day, he ■should move for its consideration
WEsTUlN TFRRlTOkY OF THE UNITED STATES
Mr. CUSHING moved to take up and refer an
Executive message, on the table of the House,
giving information concerning th,e extreme western
teintory of the United States. Mr. C. said that
Great Britain was, at the present moment, pursu-
ing, or at least permitting, a series of gross-en- ,
croachmems on that part of the territory of the
United States, encroachments flagrant, palpable,
monstrous, which it was time the whole nation
should undeistaud
The message was accordingly taken up, and re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
