STRAWBERRY PLAINS, March 23, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel RANSOM,

Acting Chief Quartermaster, Knoxville:

By some blunder the cars loaded with rations were left here when the train went to Mossy Creek to-day. As General Stoneman telegraphs he is entirely out of subsistence for his command, I shall send the train back to him with these stores. This will account for its not returning at usual time to Knoxville.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

Major-General STONEMAN,

Twenty-third Army Corps:

I shall send back the train with the subsistence stores which were left here. Let your commissaries be ready to receive and take charge of them.

By command, &amp;c.:

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

STRAWBERRY PLAINS, March 23, 1864.

Major-General STONEMAN,

Commanding Twenty-third Army Corps, Mossy Creek:

I expect to forward orders to-morrow to send the Sixty-fifth Illinois, Colonel Cameron's regiment, home on furlough as veterans. General Wood's men do not report any more regiments re-enslited and we are only waiting for his official statement on the subject. You may make your arrangements accordingly.

By command, &c.:

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., Memphis 23, 1864.

(Received 2 p. m., 24th.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

Since telegraphing you regarding the state of my command, I sent General Elliott to Nashville to ascertain the wants and condition of the cavalry. He informs me that there are at that place 4,900 men for duty, exclusive of General Gillmen's Tennessee regiments, and only 800 horses there, and the following ordnance stores required in addition to what are there: 2,600 sabers, 3,900 carbines, 3,600 saddles. I spoke to Captain Baylor, my chief of ordnance, concerning this, a few days since, and he showed me an answer to telegram on the subject from Chief of Ordnance, which stated that arms would be furnished as soon as they could be procured, but that they were not to be had.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
