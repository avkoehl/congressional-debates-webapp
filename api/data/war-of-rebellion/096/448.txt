got back to the position you intend them to occupy. It will be advisable to send this order to Warren at once, so as to prevent any further attack, unless promising great advantages to us.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, February 7, 1865-1.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I will go to Washington to-morrow, or as soon as you notify me the troops now out are in the new position they are to occupy. I was summoned some two weeks since to appear before the Committee on the Conduct of the War.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-2.45 p.m. (Sent 4 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Cipher dispatch received. I will notify you as soon as the troops are in position, but I hardly think it will be by to-morrow, as I have some works to erect before I can unmans the forces on the left. As soon as your dispatch of 11.30 was received I forwarded it to Warren, directing him to cease offensive operations unless some very important advantage was to be gained. At 12.20, before my dispatch had reached him, he reported Crawford having carried the enemy's line of skirmish rifle-pits, and that a prisoner reported them in line of battle near Dabney's Mill, where they were yesterday. I expect soon to h ear my dispatch has reached him. I was desirous, for the morale of the command, that the offensive should be taken. Warren has sent in the return of one division, and I hope from it that the losses yesterday will be much less than was at first supposed. Large numbers of stragglers have come in during the night and this morning. A deserter reports Rodes' old division as having been moved from the north of the Appomattox to enemy's right. Has Ord heard anything of this?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

February 7, 1865-5.15 p.m. (Sent 5.22 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have just received a dispatch from Major-General Warren, announcing he had recovered most of the ground he occupied yesterday, and had again drawn the fire of the artillery in the enemy's works. As this accomplishes all I expected him to do I have directed him to withdraw to Hatcher's Run, and shell hold the line from Fort Sampson to Armstrong's Mill with the Second Corps, and post the Fifth Corps from the Vaughan road crossing back toward the Halifax road, prepared to meet a flank movement of the enemy or to support any point threatened in front.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
