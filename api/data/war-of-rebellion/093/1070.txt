The quartermaster's and other stores not absolutely [needed] at Tullahoma will be sent to Murfreesborough. Have you sent surplus wagons there, and when?

The two infantry companies at Shelbyville will be withdrawn and substituted with cavalry, and scouts kept well out to the west. You will be expected to hold your position
