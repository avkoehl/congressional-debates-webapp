There is no definite information from the Rappahannock above Fredericksburg. At that point there is no force excepting guerrillas and a few men on furlough. A scout of 500 cavalry has been ordered to the vicinity of Rappahannock bridge to obtain all possible information as to movements of the enemy. It has been reported that he is picketing the river with the Fifteenth Virginia cavalry, from Fitz Lee's command. Result of the scout will be duly reported.
