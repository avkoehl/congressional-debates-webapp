THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 27.
of the sales of the national domain, the opening
and clearing the forests, and the extension of the
western settlements Another source of expense
to the office, and which is constantly mcieasing
with theaceumulation of its arrears, is the issuing,
m ignorance of the fact, of patents to purchasers,
or to their assigns, aftei the death of the patentees
To remedy this defect in the system of legal grants
for lands sold, which has now become serious and
embarrassing, it is necessary for Congiess to pro-
vide by law that patents issued to persons d eceased,
the legal title shall mure to the heirs and devisees,
to every lawful effect and extent, as if they had
been executed and delivered in the lifetime of the
same
The surveys of the public lands have progressed
to a very considerable extent, a laige poraon of
which, however, are rendered immediately un-
availing, in consequence of the deficiency of aid
provided by law in the offices of the surveyois
general. At the present time I am not able to
make a particular report thereof, but it is expected
that statements in detail of the progress of this
work, and the condition and necessities of each
officeon thefirst of January next, will be returned,
as soon as practicable after that date, by the sev-
eral surveying departments When these state-
ments aie íeceived, they will be communicated m
etlenio, or in a condensed form, as may be íe-
quired It is known, however, that the surveys
of about eight hundred townships have been made
and paid foi, the plats and descriptive notes of
which should he returned to this office, and to the
proper land offices, in the course of six or eight
months. A iaige amount of surveys have been
made and are in progress which will be completed
and paid for, and the returns thereof made, during
the year 1834, if the necessary means should be
provided by Congress. I consider it my duty to
state, in connexion with this subject, that it is
impossible for the public surveys to progiess, and
the sales and disposition of the national domain to
be facilitated and extended with advantage to the
Government, and without mjuty to individuals,
unless more discretionary power is ' ested in the
Tteasury Department to meet unfoieseen evils and
the defects oí legislation, to bring up and pievent
the accumulation of arrears, and to secure a piompt
and efficient discharge of public duty I would,
therefore, respectfully piopose that the Secretary
of the Treasury, on a reported statement of the
facts by the Commissioner of the Geneial Land
Office, be authorized and directed by law to cause
all the arrears of the suiveying departments to be
brought up as soon as piacticable, to require an
authenticated transcupt of the íecords of the field
notes to be transmitted to the Geneial Land Office,
to cause renewed township plata to be furnished to
the land offices, wheie the orig nals have become
so defaced and mjuied, and the entncs thereon
obliterated by constant use, as to be no longer
available, in every particular, as public documents,
and to nake reasonable allowance for the surveys
of the prmcmal and guide meridians and base lines,
and particulai sections of the public lands, in cases
•where they cannot be executed foi the prices
allowed by law, and that the expense theieof be
paid out of the general appropriation for the sur-
veys of the public lands
In making this annual report, I am again le-
quired, by a sense of public duty, to present a
brief view of the an ears of business in this office,
and the means necessary to bring up those arreáis,
in connexion with a propei discharge of current
duty    Under the head of,
1st Private land claims —The printing and pub-
lication ot State papers, by Gales & Seaton, and
Dud Gieen, supersede much of the duty previ
ously required by this bureau The arrears of
this blanch of business can now be brought up by
one competent clerk in one year
21 Million \j bounty lanh—The duties now re-
quired to be perfoimed under this head would
requne the time of thiee clerks for one yeai.
3d Potting the entries and sales of pubha lands,
and adjusting ihe qmrterlj accounts thereof, would
occupy the time, for one year, of six intelligent
ard industrious clerks.
4th Indexes to She records of pa'en's, a work of
the most pressing necessity, and which is almost
entnely in arrears from the commencement of the
public land oales, cannot be accomplished m less
than one year by fifteen active and competent
cleiks
5th. The ovemng of tiact books for surveys al
leady returned to the office, as rendered neces-
sary by the quaitei quaiter section subdivision,
would lequire the service of two clerks foi one
year
6th Willing, recording, and examining patents
for land sold —The amount of arrears under this
h°ad, for lands sold to the first of January next,
will exceed seveí,ty-two thousand jate^ts
To write, record, and examine the same, would
require the services of eighteen diligent clerks foi
a year
7th Suspended casesundei the credit siptem, from
a difficulty of completing the title papers, and the
great labor of examination, willdemand thebervice
of two clerks one year who aie acquainted with
this duty
8th. The D¡aughtsman's Bureau —Therearenow
in the office 926 township plats tobe piotracted
on the maps of the pioper land districts, besides
about 800 other plats, which are expected to be
returned in thecouise of six or eight months, in-
formation having been received that the suiveyb
theieof have been made and returned to the respect-
ive smveyors geneial To make the protractions
and connexions which should be done in the
couiseof the ensuing year, will require the labor
of one competent and industrious diaughtsman at
least twelve months Ihe lands selected by the
States of Ohio, Indiana, I'lmois., and Alabama,
undei grants for canal purposes, and those selected
under grants for ethei purposes, with tne school
lands selected m heuof section sixteen, have ail to
be entered and marked on the township plats and
maps of the pioper districts To perform this ser-
vice, as also that of making similar entries, under
the act of Apnl, 1832, authorizing asubdivision of
the fractional sections into forty acte tracts, would
occupy the time of a draughtsman more than one
year If it is contemplated by the Government
to complete the seivice as far as practicable, re-
qn red by a resolution of the Senate of February
28,18¿3, the labor of one draughtsman acquainted
with the duty would be required foi six years.
The daily interruption to the proper discharge of
publicduty,and theexpensesresultingto theoffice
in consequence of the continuance of these arrears,
have become evils of the most serious character,
and should be done away immediately.
9 h Miscellaneous aneáis, other than those enu
meiated would occupy the time of four clerks one
yeai. These aneáis, now amounting to the ser-
vices of fiity-nine cleiks for one yeai, have been
accumulating fir a long period of time, a large por-
tion cf whii.h existed before the administration of
the office was committed to my han Is, They
have arisen from the physical mipossibility of the
office to discharge all the duties required of it by
lawwith the force piovided foi that purpose, from
the injudicious and unfortunate reduction of six
of its clerks in 1827, from the great increase of
business, arising under the relief laws since 1826,
from the establishment of additional land and sur-
veying districts, from the numerous reservations
made 11 Indian treaties, from the many grants of
public lands for canal, road, literary, and other
purposes, and from the great increase of miscel-
laneous ousiness within the last fouroi five years,
not pieviously demanded of the office
To bring up these arrears, I would respectfully
recommend that the Secretaiy of the Treasury be
authorized to cause the same to be done, and the
expenses the1 eof paid out of any moneys in the
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to such an
extent as, in his judgment, the necessities of tne
Government and justice to individuals may íe-
quire And to enable the office to discharge its
current duties, I propose the employment theiem
of one chief cleik at a salary of $1,700 per annum,
one clerk at §1,500, five at $1 400, ten at $1,150,
and thnteen at $1,000, making, m all, thnty
clerks, and also one draughtsman at $1,150, one
assistant draughtsman at $1 150, one messengei at
$700, and two assistant messengers at |350 For
the reasons of this additional aid,and the increase
of pay to a portion of the same, I refer you to my
leport made to the Secretary of the Treasury on
the 21st of January last, and which has beef
printed as number 50 of the Senate documents of
last session    If, however, it should not be deemed
expedient by Congress to adopt this proposition,
an appropriation of £6 000 per year foi ti e writ-
ing and recording ot patents foi lands sold, and
a like appropriation for six extia clerks in the
office, would greatly facilitate its business, and
very much lessen the embarrassments under which
it now labors*
All which is respectfully submitted

DELAWARE BREAKWATER.
In the Quartermaster General's report,
accompanying the President's annual mes-
sage, is a statement of the condition of
the Delaware bieakwater. General Jesup
pronounces the experiment fairly made
and successful. The work already affords,
a good harbor foi vessels engaged in trans-
porting the mateiials for its constiuction,
as well as for such vessels engaged in
commeice as have found occasion to take
shelter tn time of storm.
The whole length of the breakwater,
according to the plan, is thirty-six hun-
dí ed feet, and the deposites of stone al-
íeady extend two thousand seven hun-
ched feet, in the following propoitions*
about one thousand feet are elevated fivo
feet above the plane of high-water, nine
bundled and fifty feet are nearly level with
high-watei, and nearly seven hundred and
fifty ieet are elevated fifteen feet above
the sea*-bottom.
TIip whole length of the ice-breaker is
to he one hundred and fifty feet, and the
deposite of stone extends one thousand
four hundred feet, of which nearly one
thousand are above high-water mark, three
hundred feet neaily up to that level, and
the íemainder about fourteen feet above
the bottom.
The quantity of stone deposited during
the last season was one hundred and fifty-
fout thousand four hundred and fifty-nine
tons, and as much more could have been
deposited, with but little increase of con-
tingent expenses, if the means had been
prouded to pay foi it.
If adequate appropriations are made,
the work can be completed in  1835.
The estimate, by Geneial Bernard, of
the cost to comp'ete the whole work, was
$2,216,950. Oí this sura, $1,160,000 has
been appropriated, leaving a balance of
$1,056,950.
Among the estimates is $20,000 for a
light-house at the western extremity of
the breakwater, which can be constructed
at less expense while the main work is
going on,,than after it is completed.—Bal-
hmoi e Jlmei icun.
It may be safely estimated that the aver-
age numbei of letters received, dehveied,
distributed, and mailed, in our city post
office, is not less than fifteen thousand
each day—New Yoik Evening Post.
