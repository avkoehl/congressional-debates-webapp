Beauregard 19,000 all told in and about Charleston; no troops left Beauregard except those on furlough; he has 35,000 men.

Five companies of heavy artillery in defenses of Richmond, four light batteries, two companies cavalry, 120 Green's men, City Battalion, 640; 4,000 citizen soldiers could be turned out.
