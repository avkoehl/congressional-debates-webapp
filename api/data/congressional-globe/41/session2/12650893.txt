approved.
CORRECTION OF TUN JOURNAL.
Mr. POMEROY. I notice in the reading of
the Journal, awl I have noticed it two or three
times lately, that it says "After an executive
session the Senate adjourned." It should say
" After an executive session, the doors being
opened, the Senate adjourned;" because if we
adjourn in executive session we must meet iu
executive session when we come together again.
We cannot adjourn iti executive session and
meet in open session. The record should read,
" After executive session, the doors being
opened, the Senate adjourned."

will take notice of the suggestion of the Senator
from Kansas.
