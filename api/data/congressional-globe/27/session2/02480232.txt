Genera] Jackson appointed him because he thought him an
honest man Ail, however, are liable to be mistaken in legard
to public men, and, once finding out our error, all that could
be done w*e to remove the obnoxious officer He, Mr B had
not been convicted oí inconsistency m íegaidtothe authority
by which the commission was appointed, or any commission
He believed the authority was not vested in the Ptesident, and
tbitt it must come fiom Congress His opinion was now, upon
this subject, what it always had been, and no inconsistency had
"been pointed out
Mr CLAY observed that in regard to the officers in the Go
vernment, he would Bay that they had not been long enough in
office to correct all the abuses of the Government which had
existed for so many years They ha i not been lona enough m
office to ferret them out It was known to the whole country
that the relations of the Whig party had not been oí thatconfi
dential character necessary to success It was known too, that
the heads of the present Departments had not been there foi
morethan five months—that changes had been made giowing
out of a difference of opinion among friends. But he would
«ay that the annals of no country had exhibited such a state of
things—such adetei mined adherence to principle as had been
manifested by the Whigs since November last Had it been
otherwise) they would not have refused teims with the Execu
uve They scorred to abandon their principles, and would re
ceive patronage for themselves and their friends upon no such
terms Ana yet gentlemen here who visited the Executive
mansion m crowds, and were piaising him every day, were
calling upon us before there was time to make íeforms to cor
rect abuses which had existed for years This puffing and
praising of the President from whom the Whigs in Congress w ere
most unfortunately alienated, was foi other purpose than to
mislead the President He would not impeach the motives of
gentlemen who made these advances He would not say
«ay what the motives were He would state what wds
his conviction, and that was, that the gentlemen had no
design of supporting the Executive many of his public mea
áurea.
Mi BUCHANAN was not disposed to have the last word in
the discussion, and would not írsist upon it However, he
had a few words to say, and would say them seriously In re

fend the head of U for his two vetoes He believed the Presi
dent to be a very amiable and honest man, but nothing had
been said in. his defence by his Democratic opponents, ex
cept upon these two questions Upon all other questions
there had been a concurrence oí opinion between the President
and the Whigs in Congress He regretted that there was not
more unity of opinion between thtm, and that there seemed
no party in the Senate to defend the President
Mr. CLAY said he regretted also, and most deeply, the state
of relations which unhappily existed between the executive
and the Legislative branches of the Government He could
appeal to the'Senator an 1 the Senator s fnends, that he had
endeavored to avoid it They found asan mheiitance an
empty Treasury, a bankiuft Government, embarrassment

cíes, and how had they been aided in this state of emburras*
ment, by the gentleman mteiested is much a.* thema Ives in
the preservation of the honoi of thecountty? Gentlemen hid
opposed them in all their efforts to relieve theGovernmen in
most of thejmeasmes of the extra srssion He thought, in
this opposition, gentlemen liad not dealt with tiiui opponents
as they had been dealt by, when they weie in powtr, aril

Mr BIH HANAN said that, on a future occasion be woul 1
review the conducto! the two pautes anee the commencement
of the present Administration and would "how js lie thought
he could, that five millions of the experts of rh Government
was brought a out by th Win" pauy in consequence of then
extravagance at tí e extia e 'ion
Mr CLA.1 Viry well, n Come on RIic luff
Mr CALHOUN rose an I ob eived that he w mid not have
said a word had not -illusion oeen ma 'e to him by the feenatoi
from Pennsylvania, nnplymg that he had a vs-iy low estimate
of his plan of economy and ruienchment by me Executive do
partment
Mr BUCHANAN interposed i he re w« i otmng in the
world Amber from his intention than to leil^c upon the t>t,na
tor from South Cirolma He had said s> m pubic and pn
vate, aid upon all occasions Alt he meart n say was, that
leform could never be accompli hed by general discussion
Detail was necessary
Mr CALHOUN had nit so understood the Senator from
Pennsy vaia It was inferred that Ik had by «eneia) duetts
sion sustained the reioimprop std when he 1 ad gone on, an 1
at gieat peisonal hbor, to piotuie and exhibit details foi the
accomplishment of leform He was foi spe< rfr leform and
the only way to accomplish it was to begin by t > reeling erro
neous opinions m regard to the pi oteetive system and the ta\
ing power ard then for the Executive to go t work m detail
to bring down expenditures Until this \\a« done Congte s
lobbed the people in ievyimrtaxes It wae plu iJei and nothing
more, and ref>rm and retrenchment could bt accomplice1
in no tther way than by coiree ing the erroroous doctrines
wnich had giown up here m regard to tax
Mr BUCHANAN said he found himself between two fires—
the Senatoi from Kentucky on the light, and the Senator fr m
South Carolina on the left He had not said that the Senatoi
from South Carolina had made a speech upon mere ^enerali
ties He only said that he remarks of the Senatoi did not
apply the remedies    1 hey pointed out the remedy only
Mr WOODBURY said he io->e to cwrrectsome errors of fict
into which the Senator from Kentucky had fa len from mad
\ertence, without dmbt
In grating the reasons whic i had induce 1 some gentlemen on
tina side of the Hou«e to vote tgimst the tariff 1 ill at the late
extra session—that Senator had imputed o[ po ion to all of
us when only a few reii*te 1 h andíie hadimpu d reasons fot
their conduct, not very charitable and, from m tpprehension
not very near what m fact governed them V* e must be al
lowed to know our own reasons a little better than others do or
can We explained them then, and he for one, would beg
leave to repeat trern now, as the explanations appear to have
been unnoticed orforgott*n.   It is admitted that the tariff bill
raised about three millions more money by indirect taxes on
the people than would have been necessary, if the proceeds of
the lands were not given away Given away, you may say
rightfully, and we wrongfully—thatl shall not now discuss, but
all must ,agree that if not given away, the taxes by thai bill
migh* have been three millions less Hence we contended that
the lands ought to be retained and the duties in the bill re
duced three millions
Yes, sir, reduced on salt, molasses, sugir, or «orne othei great
necessary of life And because you refused to do this, we ie
fused to vote for the bid Was that unpatriotic? Was it un
wise? Was not the Senate told again and asraw, that if you re
tamed the revenue from the public lands, ill the increase of the
tariff reauired to meet any puolic debt and any expenses hUita
ble to an economical a Immistration of the Government would
be cheerfully voted? That course, sn, strikes me quite as com
mendably, and as little deserving reproach now, as the one
pursued on the other side, of first throwing away a permanent
revenue from lands, and then asking us to assent to tu the peo
pie three or four millions more in consequence of such mioro
vi ence, not to say waste and recklessness
So as to the loan bill foi twelve millions, which we are now
taunted with having opposed fiom motives htilo short of fac
tious Why, sir, half at least of that loan—whether to be et
lee ted b/ scrip or Treasury notes—wa=> rendeted necessary foi
the yeai 1841, only in con&equence of the extra session lisell,
and its five to six millions of additional appropriations and the
extiavagant policy which had been pursued sm<*e March of
pushing expenditures to the greatest extent, and in evuy pos
sible direction
¡some of us, to be sure, prefeued Treasury notes toa peima
nentdebt if any thine more was to be bon owed, and facts since
have vindicated the correctness of our opinions and wishes in
that r°spect The Admimstiation has since beer obliged to
abandon the permanent loan, and come here foi the veiy Trea
sury notes they then stigmatized, and refused to substitute ior
the scrip But others voted against the loan fepl foi both causes,
the want of íeason foranyloan if prudence and economy were
pursued and ii any hadbecome indispensable by not pursuing
such safe guide , the evident superiority of Treasury notes fui
such temporary difficulties over scrip
Heie, again, let me ask the Senate anl the world, which
evinced most judgment or intelligence, oreven patriotism, the
want of which list is now so freely imputed to us by the Se
nator from Kentucky?
But, lastly, we ht.ar again from him the third or fourth
time this session, of our wish to withhold supplies, and thus
stop the wheels of Government because we did not vote for
the recent Tiea ury Note bill We stop the wheels of Govern
ment' Why, sir, they weie stopped before we were applied
to—before the Administration came here asking for relief by
means of those veiy notes they had so often and so violently
denounced Did we refuse to aid in setting the wheels in mo
tion asjain, and in plucking up drowning honor by the lock1*?
No su, no Mr Woodbury had for ene, formeily expen
enced too much pain and anx'ety—not from such a condition
actually upon me, or already happened but one an icipated,
if not averted by new means, and one seasonably pointed out,
in older to avert it—not to be ready*to furnish at once what
was now, or «ion would be necessary And I call sir on
you in the chair, and on all the Senate, to bear me witness,
that on the occasion alluded to I, and othets on this side of
the House prnoosed to pas5!, at once, with no delay or change,
the Treasury No e bill as i  come to v.
Wh > then stoppe 1 its pa^sa^e? Who then pos poned íeliefl
Who refused the supplies for days and even weeks in the
manner the House of Representatives proposed them, and as
most of us were willing to v Me them? It wds ti e very eentle
men who now impute the delay to us 1 hey were not content
to give the íehef desired in the foim preferred by the other
Hiiise They would not take enough for the exigency by sub
sntutin**" five millions of Tieasnry notes for five millions of the
permanent loan which could not be usel m the laj form but
withheld all supplies unless five millions of note^ were voted
m addition t > the loan This we opp< sed, and rightfully m ,
because the additional five millions were not neede t fm the im
meliate ex ^ency so sad the "-ecietary oftheTieisury so
we illknew They were not needed till the next quaiter or half
year tnd then would be neede 1 oi not as we in the meantime
made laige or sm ill new appmpnations t ok hack the public
Jindsor not and essentially alteiel the Tariff oi not We,
theieforc si loi that occasion—take yum fivt milln n Treasu
rv notes instead of the loan—all von now need—all von now
ask foi this emergency—but leave aw peimanent addition to
the debt till a few moie months have elap ed and you can as
certain with ceitamty whether it is likely then to be r eeded oi
not
The prudence candoi and liberality the pMiee and patriotism
of this course we are willing to leave t> the judgment of an im
paiual community
Before sitting down sir, and without entering into the pohti
cal portion (1 this debate at all peí nut me to correct a lothei
mistake of the Senator fiom Kentucky asto wiathe supposes
tobe the greatly disproportionate increase of expenses at the
custom house in New York since the days of lonathan Thomp
son He leachcshn conclusions by compaung the per centage
on thepiesent íevenue with that on t iere\pinueihpn
Bui, sn the Stnatoi onrets that the duties then on the im
ports ranged fio n fifty to one bundle 1 peí t ent while in 1833,
many \vere wholly removed and i ice 1833 the others have
been regu arly falling, so that none after this year will be above
twenty per cent
On the con riry if he takes the whole imports, and the co t
ofcollecüon compare! vi 'ithem, then and now, which is much
the fan est test because all the impoits not paying or paving
duty, and with low or high duty must be entered and the ves
seis and merchandise examined to prevent smuggling I "ay
the cost, compared with the imports has probably not increased
a dollar at is ew ^ ork
We hav e not New York exhibited alone in official tab'e^, but
we have the whole Union and we 1 now that the imports at
TSewlork have incieased moie in pioportion than those in
the wholt. Uniou being now neai two thirds of all instead of
half \ et even in the whole Union while the imparts were
884 000 000 «79 000000 and <&88 000 000 m the three last
years (1826-7-H) Mr Thompson was in the custom house
(exclud ng fraction* ) increased to $140 000 000, etl3 000 000
and $lb2000 000 the three last years in the docuaient befoie
me, (18-37,-8-9,) the íatio of expenses to the imports remain
just about the same
Thus(seeDoc No 61 HB lasteession)inthcfirstthreeyear8
the late per cent ot collection on the whole imports was only
one per cent four hundredths in 182b, and 1 11 in 1S97 and 1 06
m 1828 Had it doubled m 1837, '8 and '9^ Had it increased
fifty or twenty five, or ten, or even five per cent ? So Jar from
it, that in 1837 it wab only one per cent live hundredths, m tf e
next year, 1 33, and in the next but 1 Ob, thus exhibiting the
smahest practical increase that is capable of computation
Grant, then, that ther^ may be ai. New York some excesses
now—some m those years, and some formerly grant that there
may have been at all peno Is some impositions and frauds at a
place where merchants of all countries resor.,, and two thirds
of all our imports enter, yet the disproportionate increase of
expenses is chiefly imaginary The records of the Department
will show, likewise,that time a id again eveiy possible effort has
been made to reduce them as low as was  consistent with the
safe collection of Cae revenue, and the incidental protection to
manufactures, which my friend from Rhode Island before me,
L"VIr biMMoa-s,] and his co laborers, would have thought us very
unfaithful had wo entuely overlooked
Mi CLAY hoped the fact that a new opponent had come
into the he d would be an excuse for his continuing the dis
cuBbiou The Suiatoi had &poken of the land bill as a inea
suie which had taken a Urge amou t of revenue from the
Department—an amount equal to three millions of dollars—
when, as the senator must know, and as he did know, there
were not eight hundred thousand dollars which had been do
lived he last year from this souice, or which could bedeiived
fiom it
Mr WOODBÜRY ob&ei ved, that the debire by him and his
fierds. to na^s tho present íesolution calling foi information as
to the New York Custom houce, demonstrated that none of
them wished to ¡suppressor vmdicate any abi-ses there We
ask fir exposure h0ht, facts, and not loope conjectures or inju
nous insinuations. But I rise agam chiefly on account of the
gentl man's suggestion, that I may have taken the largest yeais
of imports to com paie wuh Mr Ihoinjsons >ears, and tnus
that the pe centage may not be lar^ret m them than m his yeais
I thank him for tie ^¿gestión Now, sn, look at the table
and you will =ee that 1 studnu'dy selec irg the largest jeas
The laigestconfcecutive years were 1835 and 1836 and I omit
ted both of them Why, sir, the expense of collection in them
was much less in proportion to the imports than under the
boasted years of 1826, 7 and 8ofMr Thompson Inl835they
were not one per cent on them, but merely 85 100, and in 1836
but 73 100, little more than two thirds the pei cent in his ttuee
la*t years I et the Senate judge, then, of the fairness of the
comparison
In reply to the stnctuiesas to three mil1 ions being too high
an estimite for the revenue from the public lands he observed
that he had u&ed the sum of three millions, as what would pi o
bably have received from public lands la^t year and notas the
sum which had actually been received Why? Because that
wis the sum at the la^t esfinate, which friends as well as fees
con Duttd Because all deemei that not too large a sum even
in the kbate on the Disfubiuion bill and this it was believed by
the chan man rum^eli
Mr W had a right to a«sume that amount also 'or
another reason Becan°e, notwithstanding the revuKions m
comment in 1837-'8,-4 and 1S40 and the derangement in.
the currency, which tne Senatoi from Kentucky says it ought
to be known would prevent so large receipts as three millions,
they di 1 not prevent it many i! those years Ir seven of them
thecurrency wasinaworse condition, and trade as errbairass
edasinlS4I Heie are the tables befoie me, air, n t guessing,
but actual and (ffieial rpturnt, and m 1837 the receipts weie
from land $6 770,236, in 1838, $3,081,939, m 1839, $7 076,447, in
1840 S3 2<>2 285
Yet with each of these embauassed years going above three
million's and two ol them to more than double ihat amount
amito be criticised because saymsthatthiee millions should
have been colleuel from landb m 1  U?
i?>ir the deliberate ndp oincted ipfusal to advertise land in
thela«t ten monti -i of 1 41 and the postponement of the «sales
or even some alvertised befoie last Maich, is the solution of
the whole difficulty Had the lands been advertised as usual,
money mustha^ ebeen co lected m very large additional amounts
because a\l the settlers on the new nacts, offered would have
paid from i ece^sity m ordei to stcuie then pie eruptions

that large numbeis of those industuous ct tiers have fht,mo
ney laid aside, and aie r ady and anxious to pay for their
janlsassion as the sales come on
Is it fair then, in the Senafoi from Kentucky to take theac
tualreceipis in 1841 v ithno advertisements five sixths of the
year as a test of what would have been ieali7ed, had adver
tisements been made of eight oi ten millions moie of acres,
which had been *mveyed?
Again the tai iff bill of last year, about which the three mil
l'ons weie spoken ol, was not to take efiect so as to put any
amoney in the TiKrt&urv till 1842 the duties being for three and
sixmmths credit on all imported under it m 1841 So the
land  weie not to eoto the States till 1842 Hence the three
millions to b" given to the States, and the three millions addi
tional taxes to be colh cted to icpay it, are all m, and for 1842
and not 1841 about which last year, 1 e complains \\ th such
vehemence but with so little foundation What the receipts
will be in 1842 time only can de ermine But as some new ad
veriisemenfs have been made since the 1st of Jinuary, and
moie are expected the proceeds can easily be made to exceed
three miiions ii pioper steps are pursued in íelation to the
sales through tre whole yeai
Mi PÍERCF thought his noor resolution had been lost sight
of   Every thing had been discussed but the resolution
The debate was furthei continued by Mes'is WRIGHT,
MANGUM, LINN aid PIERCE
At length the discussion reverted to the re&olutioi, and Mr
