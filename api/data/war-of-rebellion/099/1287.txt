HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Charlotte, February 27, 1865.

Lieutenant General WADE HAMPTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: In reply to your letter of yesterday General Beauregard directs me to say that he has ordered General Stevenson to send you a section of 12-pounder howitzers, if possible; and, if not, a section of Napoleons, since the Blakely guns have no equipment or ammunition, and furthermore, since the ammunition cannot be obtained this side of Richmond. The railroad bridge will admit of dismounted cavalry crossing in single rank, but, owing to its construction, it will not admit of being floored. Young's cavalry has been ordered, as General Beauregard is informed, to operate from Augusta in the direction of Columbia. However, if it can cross the Santee you are authorized to order it to report to you. I inclose you a copy of the last letter from Lieutenant-General Hardee for your information.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLOTTE, N. C., February 27, 1865-7 a. m.

Lieutenant General WADE HAMPTON,

Fort Mills, S. C.:

Those two pieces are without artillerists and horses. Shall I send them as they are? Answer.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Near Nation Ford, S. C., February 27, 1865-11 a. m.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Aide-de-Camp and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that I am crossing my command over the railroad bridge at this point as rapidly as possible. I learn that I shall have to go up to Morrow's Station in order to get over the streams between this and Lancaster, as the creeks are swoolen and deep. I have already lost much ammunition to swimming creeks. I think it best not to undertake to swim those between this point and Lancaster. After crossing Sugar Creek I shall move toward Lancaster, or so as to join you. Please send a courier to meet me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
