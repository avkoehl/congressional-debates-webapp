I have always been determined to send the Government every man called for, and have felt sure that it had been done, and more, too. The accompanying statement by the adjutant-general, taken from the State records, indicates that and excess of men has been furnished.

I am, with high regard, your obedient servant,

FREDERICK HOLBROOK,

Governor of Vermont.

Major WINCENT:

Will you please look into this and be sure we are right. Massachusetts also claims to have furnished her quota; look over that again. They say they furnished many recruits to old regiments before Antietam, and I see they claim that all their regiments (nearly) went in over a thousand strong. Return.

STATE OF VERMONT, ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE, Woodstock, May 6, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Yours of the 25th instant, giving notice that Vermont has not furnished her full quota of men under the President's calls of July 2 and Augusta 4, 1862, and asking that the deficiency may be apportioned upon the Congressional districts in the State, has been received and has surprised me beyond measure. The State of Vermont has not only furnished all the troops required under the three calls, but an excess over all of 537 men, as you will perceive by the accompanying statement, prepared from the muster-rolls and regimental returns on file in this office, and duplicates of which will be found in the office of the Adjutant-General of the Army.

The State has, as you will perceive, furnished an excess of three-yards" men above her quota under the first call of 500,000 and the second call of 300,000 of 612 men, and is deficient but 75 in nine-months" men, leaving a net excess beyond all quotas of 537 men.

It has been the pride and tho boats of the State that she has furnished every man required from her by the General Government, and with a degree of promptness not excelled by any one.

I can only express my surprise that the records of the War Department either do not show the number of men actually furnished by her, or else that the excess of men furnished by her beyond her quota under the first call has been entirely overlooked.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

PETER T. WASHBURN,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
