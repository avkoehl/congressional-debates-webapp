necessary here to direct and superintend the organization of the troops. If the rebels are moving in force, we are satisfied from all indications that their destination is in direction of Baltimore or Washington. I very respectfully suggest that General Couch be clothed with full power, if it is not already done.

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, July 7, 1864-3. 20 p. m.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

As commander of the department, General Couch is vested with all needful powers for organizing troops and defending it from invasion. If any special power is needed it can be applied for by telegraph. If communication with Washington should be interrupted he will act as he thinks the service requires.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 7, 1864-2 p . m. (Received 3 p. m.)

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

Your dispatch of 3. 10 yesterday to me, and repeated to-day, was received on my arrival at Chambersburg at 9 o'clock p. m., and answered immediately. An intelligent officer is at Waynesborough vicinity endeavoring, by the aid of scouts, to find out about the rebels crossing at Shepherdstown, &amp;c. I have no information of it from any of my scouts or Sigel's who have come into my lines. A dispatch of 12. 45 p. m. to-day states that one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry are in bivouac three miles beyond Greencastle. Any reliable information of importance shall be sent you at once.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

Road from Hagerstown to Greencastle clear of rebels at 3. 10 p. m. McCausland's command, Imboden's old brigade, entered Hagerstown last night, 1,500 strong-cavalry, mounted infantry, and one battery. Levied $20,000 in cash, and a large amount of clothing. Moved off before [morning] on pike toward Frederick. I am every moment hoping to hear from Boonsborough.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
