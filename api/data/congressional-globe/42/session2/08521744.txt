old) rich or poor. The aggregate value in
gold of all imported manufactures of wool in
the last fiscal year, was $42,860,037. These
imports, with the duties and cost of trans-
portation added, may be safely assumed to be
-worth $88,000,000. The duty on all these
fabrics averages about sixty-eight per cent.
ad valorem on the original cost, and it paid to
the revenue last year, $29,024,372, equal to
about seventy-three cents per capita paid by
the people of the United States to the Treasj
ury on the imported fabrics of wool. But there
were domestic manufactures of wool consumed
in the country last year which paid no duty,
worth at least $176,000,000 more, making the
aggregate consumption of the manufactures of
wool in the country at least $204,000,000, of
which one third only paid duty to the Treasury.
But the domestic manufacturers of woolen
goods, by reason of this enormous duty, are able
to keep out effective competition from abroad,
and to charge to the consumers the same prices
as if all their products had paid the same dutyj
Thus this excessive duty is made to cost the
people in a single year for protection alone,
and in addition to what it paid the Treasury)
at least $80,000,000, or two dollars per capita,
in tribute to favored classes and to monopolists,
or in enhanced prices caused by the tariff. It is
absurd, it mocks common sense, to call such
exactions revenue duties. Theyarenot; they
defeat revenue, and are simply and grossly
protective and prohibitory, and are imposed
in the interests of the few, and to enable them
to extort unrighteous tribute from all the
people.
TEA.
Let us take another subject of taxation for
comparison. In the calendar year 1871, the
importation of tea was 59,022,145 pounds,
equal to one and a half pounds per capita,
and the duty is fifteen cents per pound, yield-
ing in revenue $8,943,321, so that the average
cost of this duty per capita is just twenty-two
and a half cents. And every dollar it costs
the people it pays the Treasury. It is pure
revenues with not a cent for "protection,"
monopolies) rings, favorites, or tariff-fed rob-
bers. There is no possibility of imposing any
tariff' tax that will pay so much in revenue
and cost less to the people, it builds up no
ill-gotten fortunes, or powerful corporations,
and does notexpei competition nor violate the
law of fair play. It is impossible to impose a
protective duty on tea or coffee. There is no
domestic producer of them to protect. Hence
the protectionists want them free. They want
no tariff taxes imposed that will not pay them
as much or more than they pay the Treasury.
COTTON.
Another view is afforded by a brief reference
to the fabrics of cotton, also of universal use
and primary necessity. The import in the last
fiscal yeat Was in gold value $26,587,994, wldch
paid the Treasury $10,773,832, the average
rata of duty being forty-one per cent, ad va-
lorem, and the result to the Treasury amounting
to about twenty-seven cents per capita of the
people. The currency value of the imports
of cotton fabrics was about $30,000,000, but
the domestic manufactures of cotton fabrics iti
the same year were worth at the mills about
$170,000,000) making an aggregate of con-
sumption of such goods by all the people of
$200,000,000) ohly three twentieths of which
paid tribute to theOoverhlnent, Yet) by reason
of the tariff, the forty million consumers of
cottoh goods were compelled to pay tribute
upon the other sevetiteen twentieths to the
protected manufacturers in this country, the
gentlemen who devise and dictate tariffs, be-
cause the tariff shuts out competitors, gives
them the command of the market, and thus
builds Up monopolies here at an expense to
the people of not less than $50,000,000. no
part of which the Treasury receives. Does
any gentleman foil to see that such an adjust-
ment of tariff taxes violates bVety principle of
deceht regulation for revenue? Such laws are
demanded only by men—selfish men—whose
moral perceptions have been so disciplined
in the struggle for gain as to enable them to
believe it is just and honest for the Govern-
ment to compel their fellow-men to pay bounty
to them.
SDQAR.
I must ask attention to another illustration
of the practical difference between a tariff for
revenue and one for protection. The total
importation of sugar in the calendar year
1871 was 1,337,656,073 pounds, worth in gold
$72,317,951, and it paid to the Treasury in
revenue about $33,600,000. That shows an
average consumption per capita of thirty-three
and a half pounds in the year, at a cost in tax
to the Government of eighty-four cents per
capita. This tax is in its essential nature also
a pure revenue tax, because the amount of
sugar produced in our country is inconsider-
able in comparison with the total consump-
tion, and the tax therefore tends to foster no
hateful and oppressive monopolies. But in
the practical adjustment of this tax on the
different qualities of sugar great wrong is done
by imposing too high a duty on imported clari-
fied sugars. The result is that the refiners of
imported raw sugars are enabled to erect a
greedy monopoly in their business and rob the
people by charging too high prices for the
refined sugars. A reduction of the duty on
refined sugars would open the door to fair
competition, give the people cheaper sugar,
and increase the revenue. But no protectionist
elamdrs for this reform, because the existing
adjustment of the tax favors a monopoly.
IRON.
I come next briefly to consider iron, one of
the most invaluable products of the earth, a
supreme necessity for civilization in the devel-
opment of resources and capacities, atrd, after
those products of industry which either directly
nourish or protect the human body, this is the
most indispensable necessity for mankind iji
all his struggles for material progress and im-
provement. Every principle of just policy,
every suggestion of enlightened justice, every
sentiment of manly sympathy, demands that,
upon such necessities as iron and steel, and
their innumerable products, the least taxation
shall be imposed that will afford adequate rev-
enue—the minimum on the raw material and
instrumentalities for the successful employ-
ment of labor. Observe how little these great
obligations are regarded or discharged m our
abominable tariff as it exists to-day.
The imports of iron and steel and of their
manufactured products during the calendar
year 1871 were worth $47,849,802 in gold,
and paid in revenue about $20,530,000. The
duty on these imports averages about forty-
three per cent, ad valorem, and amounts to
a tax of fifty cents per capita against all the
people. These imports, reduced to currency
value, amount to about $52,634,980. But in
addition to these imports, it is estimated that
the people of the United States consumed in
the same year of the primary manufactures of
iron and steel the following products of domes-
tic furnaces, rolling-mills, and forges, the tons
being of 2,000 pounds each :
% Toyis ' Value
Pig iron, all kinds 1,906,000 460,710,000
Rails  725,000 45,312,500
Merchant bar and rod  330.000 26,400,000
Sheet and plate  118,000 11,800,000
Hoops  22,000 2.640,000
Nails and spikes  155,000 12,400,000
Axles and other rolled and
hammered iron   75,000 7,000,000
Steel of all kinds  75,000 li,2o0,000
Old rails and other scrap iron.. 500,000 18,000,000
Total 3.906,000 $105 512,500
Adding the imports and domestic products
together, they give the grand total of con-
sumption at $248,147,480. But if you follow
this vast aggregate of consumption of iron and
steel to its final finish by the founderres, ma-
chine-shops, and other subordinate manufac-
tories, and by the million of individual me-
chanics throughout the country, its value would
no doubt attain the magnificent sum of at least
$750,000,000. The exact extent to which these
infinitely diversified products are aggravated
in cost to the consumers, the people, by the
tariff and this protective duty no man may
precisely estimate. But if the imported
$52,034,980 paid in tribute to the Govern-
ment $20,530,000, it is self-evident that the
$195,512,500 of domestic product cost the
consumers, in tribute to the iron-mongers,
manufacturers, and monopolists, or in en-
hanced cost by reason of the tariff, a vast sum,
moderately estimated at $50,000,000. It will
be readily perceived by every one, however
unfamiliar with the teachings of political econ-
omy, that such a mode of taxation sets at
defiance the true principles of tariff adjust-
ment, and is simply protective of the few
favorites, and cruelly and scornfully neglectful
of the rights and welfare of the many. It repels
competition, fosters monopoly, oppresses gen-
eral industry, and retards progress. Itaflects
directly, pecuniarily, and injuriously every
industry in our country. It aggravates all
prices to the damage of all consumers. It
enhances the cost of railroads and all other
modes of transportation, and of all freights,
to the gross and manifest injury of every mem-
ber of society. I will append to these remarks
an interesting table, showing the foreign and
domestic iron and steel consumed in this coun-
try in the year 1871. It is prepared by a very
intelligent protectionist of Pennsylvania. *
