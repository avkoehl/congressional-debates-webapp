I make the above proposition to meet what I consider to be the wishes of the general commanding the Army of the Potomac, under the circumstances.

Respectfully submitted.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, September 8, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report all quiet on my front during the last twenty-four hours. Scouts report the enemy leaving their camps during the night in front of the First Brigade, Third Division, taking everything with them. No changes have been discovered in the position of the enemy in front of any other portion of the line.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, September 8, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to honor to report all quiet on the lines of the Second Cavalry Division during the night. At one or two points a few dismounted men occasionally approach the line. These men are seeking a remount.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Cavalry.

DUTCH GAP, VA., September 8, 1864.

Colonel HENRY L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy have not fired so regularly to-day as yesterday. They invariably cease shelling soon after our batteries open. Major Ludlow seems to think that we ought to stop their fire altogether, a thing utterly impossible, you know. The working party has not been compelled to quit labor a minute during the day. Last night not a shot was fired by the rebels in this direction. All had a quiet sleep.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, September 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am pushing work forward at all points on the redoubts of second line. Have commenced one at Hare house, inclosing the work there.
