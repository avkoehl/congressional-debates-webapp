Numbers 500. Report of Colonel John C. Higginbotham, Twenty-fifth Virginia Infantry.

CAMP NEAR MARTINSBURG, W. VA., July 21, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I herewith respectfully report that at twilight, July 1, in obedience to orders from Captain [R.] Cleary, acting assistant adjutant-general, I threw forward four companies, under the command of Major [R. D.] Lilley, as a picket to cover the front of the brigade, which were deployed as skirmishers the following morning at dawn. At 3 p. m., in accordance with instructions, I deployed the remaining portion of my regiment, and assumed charge of the line. The skirmishing, which had only been occasional, and confined more closely to the center of the left wing, became more general as the line advanced. We were shelled until the base of the line. The skirmishing, which had only been occasional, and confined more closely to the center of the left wing, became more general as the line advanced. We were shelled until the base of the hill occupied by the enemy was reached, but without casualties. The enemy made but feeble resistance until thrown back upon their line of support, well sheltered behind rocks and other accidents, in rear of a small branch, but were dislodged in one charge. Just here my casualties were the heaviest. At 8 p. m. I received a wound that caused me, after the firing had nearly ceased, to surrender my command to Lieutenant-Colonel Robinson. The regiment remained in line of battle that night, with pickets thrown forward, and at dawn, July 3, advanced, throwing 50 men forward as sharpshooters, under the command of Lieutenants [J. G.] McCray and [J. H.] Yancey. These sharpshooters, as well as the supporting regiment, were engaged during the entire day. At 12 o'clock that night, the regiment withdrew with the brigade to the chain of hills in front of Gettysburg. Remained quietly in line during the day of July 4, and, after twilight, with the division, marched in the direction of Fairfield. It is with pleasure that I can testify to the gallantry and skill exhibited by Lieutenant-Colonel Robinson and Major Lilley in lending assistance to me, as well as the same I affirm of the commanding officers of Companies A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, &amp;tc. ; First Lieutenant [Solomon] Poe; Captain [W. H.] Fitchett, Captain [E. D.] Camden, Captains [C. D.] McCoy, [J. H.] Johnson, [J. M.] Berry, [R. E. A.] Stuart, [Wilson] Harper, and [J.] W. Mathews, with their several lieutenants. I never saw men act better. My casualties in killed, wounded, and missing are 70. *

I am, captain, very respectfully,

JNO. C. HIGGINBOTHAM,

Colonel, Commanding Twenty-fifth Virginia Infantry.

Captain SAMUEL J. C. MOORE, A. A. G., Jones' Brigade.
