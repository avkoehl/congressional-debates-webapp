Part of the cavalry on this side of the river was due at Savannah yesterday. Remainder starts to-day from this point and Pulaski. If too late to operate in West Tennessee we can aid you in Mississippi. Please communicate with me at Savannah by a scout from Corinth immediately.

HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Vicksburg, Miss., January 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General ELLET,

Commanding Fleet:

GENERAL: You will immediately come up with your command and cruise between Milliken's Bend and a short distance above Greenville, to keep the river clear of guerrillas, and extend what protection you can to plantations along the bank.

It has for certain purposes been found necessary to break up and remove the posts at Milliken's Bend and Goodrich's Landing, and Skipwith's, and the plantation lessees feel that they are left without any protection. You will reassure them as much as possible, and not let them become stampeded unnecessarily.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
