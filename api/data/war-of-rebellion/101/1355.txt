his views. If the latter troops are left I may possibly be able to hold this point, but it is exceedingly doubtful. As soon as this reduction is known the country will be abandoned by the citizens. One other point of view, which with the Confederacy in a different condition I would not make, is this: That I believe fully one-fourth of the command ordered east will desert. Had we plenty of men I should say let them go. These are the men in a great measure, from whom we are to expect depredations, and I would not even be surprised if they joined the enemy. The other day when some deserters were returned to me by General Mejia, in accordance with an arrangement made with him, 300 deserters are said to have left Matamoras, 125 of whom are known to have fled to the enemy at Brazos. In view of all I have said, I do not believe you could increase the garrison at Galveston even if you should order my whole command in this district, more than 600 or 800. Finally, I would suggest to the commanding general that I be permitted to retain my present force in this district; that no more recruits shall be received. If the plans which I have already inaugurated succeed the question of supplies can be set at rest. I shall hold the remainder of the troops ready to move, awaiting the answer of the general by next mail.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. E. SLAUGHTER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
