Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF Kentucky,Lexington, Ky., May 9, 1864.

Colonel C. S. HANSON,

Commanding THIRD Brigade, Irvine, Ky.:

COLONEL: I understand that two respectable Union men were recently robbed and murdered by guerrillas in one of the counties beyond your post; instruct your scouting parties to ascertain, if possible, the names of parties who were guilty of so great an outrage; endeavor to have them captured or killed. I would prefer, and will insist, that no regular guerrillas be sent in as prisoners; direct your command to deal with such characters in a speedy and summary manner. The usages and customs of civilized nations when at war forbid the extension of leniency or quarters to guerrilla bands.

Very respectfully,

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., DIST. OF Kentucky,Irvine, Ky., May 9, 1864-10 a. m.

GENERAL: Three hundred and fourteen of the FIFTY-second Kentucky and forty-three of the Thirty-seventh Kentucky Mounted Infantry moved at 8 o'clock this morning, under command of Colonel Grider, with eight days' rations. I ordered 400 and was told by the officers that number would be ready to move, but at the appointed time the above number only was presented. I will accompany the command for several days, probably beyond Owsley County, and will keep you posted. Major Martin is left in command, being the ranking officer, Colonels Grider and Johnson being with the scout.

I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. HANSON,

Colonel Thirty-seventh Kentucky, Commanding Brigade.
