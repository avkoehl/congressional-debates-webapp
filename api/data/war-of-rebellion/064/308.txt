MORGANZA, LA., June 11, 1864.

Colonel THOMAS,

Commanding Eighth Vermont:

COLONEL: The commanding general directs me to say that he cannot believe that there are more than 100 guerrillas at Waterloo. You will therefore go down accompanied by the gun-boats, land, and attack the town with vigor by daylight. If it should turn out on getting there that the report is false, you will not land your command or any part of it.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CARROLLTON,Carrollton, La., June 11, 1864.

Major J. LEVERING,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Defenses of New Orleans:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state, for the information of the major-general commanding the defenses, my conviction that the grounds in and about Kenner are much better adapted to the purposes of temporary camps than any in or about New Orleans, Jefferson, or Carrollton. The drainage is better, and I doubt not the health of troops would be better. Convenient access to timber would enable all troops to cover themselves with shade, by the construction of arbors, at little labor. I have examined the ground there myself,
