GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, No. 113. New Orleans, December 20, 1862

Col. John S. Clark, aide-de-camp to the commanding general, is provisionally appointed provost-marshal-general of the Department of the Gulf. All applications for permission to trade or travel within the military lines of the department will be made to this officer. No permits will be given at present to travel or trade beyond the lines.

No fees will be charged, received or paid for the issue of permits either for travel or trade, and no exclusive privileges or monopolies will be recognized or encouraged. It is the desire of the commanding general to re-establish the privileges of intercourse and commerce within the lines upon the most liberal basis consistent with the interests of the Government.

Such regulations as are necessary to maintain the rights of the Government and to relieve well-disposed and loyal people will be promulgated in general orders and printed upon such passes as shall be issued from the office of the provost-marshal-general or his deputies. All such regulations established for the protection of the Government will be enforced with relentless military rigor. Any person who seeks and accepts the favor of the Government and then violates the faith which he has pledged will be adjudged guilty of a flagitious crime and punished without appeal or mercy.

By command of Major-General Banks:

RICH'D B. IRWIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, No. 114. New Orleans, December 21, 1862

Information has been received at these headquarters that publications injurious to the character of soldiers of the United States are circulated in the streets and that anonymous and threatening letters are sent to officers connected with the public service. Such practices are indecent, offensive, and criminal, and must be suppressed.

The troops of this department are instructed to observe a respectful deportment to all persons, and the same deference will be exacted from all person in their favor. Any attempt on the part of any person whatever, by offensive personal conduct, to excite passion, or which tends to personal altercation or controversy and the disturbance of the public peace, will be punished with the sharpest severity known to military law.

The commanding general requests that any violation of this order be reported to these headquarters or to the provost-marshal-general.

By command of Major-General Banks:

RICH'D B. IRWIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.
