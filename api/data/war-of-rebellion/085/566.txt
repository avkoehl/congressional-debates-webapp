Major G. W. KELLY,

MAJOR: The general commanding directs that you will immediately assume command of all detachments of the Fourth and Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia now at this post. Move at once to Castle Rock, on the Osage River, and place yourself in communication with Colonel Philips, who is operating east and south of that point. You will establish strong guards at Bolton's, Clark's, and other fords in that vicinity. The command will take with them 3,000 rations of bread, sugar, coffee, and salt.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BOLTON'S FORD, OSAGE RIVER,

TWO MILES ABOVE CASTLE ROCK,

October 2, 1864--5 a. m.

Captain J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I reached this point at 9 o'clock last night. Had to lie here on account of artillery; miserable road. Sent three companies across river last night to scout and look out. Nothing heard yet. I find this to be the main crossing. The ferry amounts to nothing. I leave a picket of ten men at ferry and thirty men here to watch this and a ford three miles above. I move toward Gasconade at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. F. PHILIPS,

Colonel Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia.

P. S.--I found Lieutenant Stephens' [detachment] Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia at Castle Rock, and leave it here on picket duty.

J. F. P.,

Colonel.

INDEPENDENCE, October 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General BROWN,

Sedalia:

Will troops arrive to relieve us? I have left two companies at Kansas City with Major Pritchard. This place is not safe with less than two companies. If I leave it without troops it will be burned before to-morrow night.
