PULASKI, TENN., November 20, 1864.

Colonel STRICKLAND,

Columbia, Tenn.:

Forrest is advancing from Florence toward Columbia with about 10,000 men. He will doubtless try to strike the railroad between this place and Columbia, or to capture Columbia for the purpose of crossing Duck River. Be prepared to meet him, and hold the railroad and pontoon bridges. Inform Colonel Capron, and tell him to watch and delay Forrest's movements and try to unite with General Hatch, who will move between Forrest and the railroad.

COLONEL: I have just received your report of the 18th. You seem to have entirely misunderstood your instructions, and I except to hear of the capture of your command. Move back at once toward Mount Pleasant as far as the intersection of the Lawrenceburg road, and from that point scout toward Lawrenceburg and Waynesborough and on the lateral roads. General Hatch reports Forrest advancing toward Lawrenceburg yesterday noon. Possibly you may get this in time.

Respectfully,
