of just reasoning and theoretic piopnety would of themselves
teach us that the one ought not to be left at the merry of the   I
Other but ought to possess a constitutional and effectual power

''The pumas y inducement to conferring the power m ques
tion upon the Executive is to enable him to derend himself"
It was "chiefly designed" to provide him with la bhield" against
attacks upon his 'constitu lunal rights "
But, aec mdly, the power was defended on the ground that' it
Wtabll  esa salutary check upon the Legislative body, calm
la ed to guard the community against the effect of faction, pie-
cipnancy, or of any impulse unfriendly to the public good,
which may happen to influence a majoiity" oí the Legislative
body. And it was urged that not only might the love of power
«omstiraes betray the Legislature two a disposition to encroach
upon ihe rights of the other membersof the Government, but
*thataspimof iaction might sometimes peivett its dehbeia
lions—that impressions of the moment might sometimes  hmry
it into measures whieh itself, on matuie leflection, would

Are tne Bank bills passed at the present session of Confess
obnoxious to theobjection that they were carrie 1 throjgu the
two Houses in haste, with precipitmcy, 01 i ndei an impt 'oe
unfriendly to the public good? Did they originate in aspint ot
faction or in theampressions of the mom ut1 It would be a
sufftcientanswer to say thit the Piesi !ent himself has brought
no such accusation against the Legislature and made u the
ground of his objection'o these measures B aides, a Bank of
the United States, Dy whatsoever name it may be called, is no
offspring of a momentary or haaty ímpiession It 11 an inati
tution whose existence is coeval with the fio eminent itself,
anil since the year 1829, when Gen Jackson in his hist mea
sage to Congress, commenced his seven ye us' wai on the late
Bink of IheUnitedStates, the question of the con^ 'lonaliry
and expediency of a B ink has been discussed m every foini by
t>ne or both of the political parties, without a day's inteimis

Executive, by chaigmg his fellow membeis uith ia-*h m on*i-

be essential to the best interests of the whole country It
would beas unjust as unneee^saty for ny pp^ iliar fnenl of

But.si, I will resume the arguments of Mr Hamilton in
favor of clothing the President with power to negative die acts
of Congress    He says
"If a magistrate so powerful mdsowell fortified asa British

Hoff beao'iful thit, i~> m theoiy A British monnich with all

caution "

I h ive s"en a pamphlet on tie veto powei and its exercise,
I repp tlv published in thp city <f New Yotk, in which ihe
! writer defends the pow r in questioi as w se and benpficent,
and denies-that the Piesident's 1'mited in jts exeicise fay any
consideiati ms e-if pt such a^ may anse from his own sense of
duty—asserting that 'the eimpte rula ol du'y becomes the sin-
gle lest of conduct " The wishes of a majority of both

Execu ive power, to have any influence on tie determination
of tho Piesulent' Pubiicopioion, he says, affords no te«f of
the proprip y of the e\erci e of this power, because public
opi ion, at c uding io him is itself 'the subject of jts control "
Ihe Preeidenthas fotmu in ihe author ot this pamphlet an
able an 1 zeal ms defender But, sir, in a contest between pow-
er and the n^nts of th" people, I cmfess my sympathies are

'and bpnreiy and cautiously exorcised We have the high
ev evidence that the powet m question, though obnoxious to
the peonle, wa=> finally adopted by them on the faith of these
assurances
if any additional proof was required to establish the limita
tion of the veto power, lor which I have contended, u will be
found m the danger, which must have been foreseen, of giving
to the Piesident a neganve as compr hensive as the entire field
of egislation I o give such a power would be to subject the
acion of both Houses of Congret-s. and ihe will of the nation,
to the fiat of one man It would invest the President with
power to prescribe for the nation just sucha scheme of rid he
policy as he might devise, regardless alike of the wishes of Con
gre-ss and the wants of the people For it is proved bj tho ex
peuenceofthe past and the present, that the pationage of tre
President is strong enough to defeat any measure that depends
for its success on the votes of two thnds of each House of Con
gress There is no instance on recoid, and nothirg is hazarded
m predicting that there never will be or e, of the recons'dera
tion and pas&age of a bi rl by Congress that had been pi eviousiy
negatived by the Piesident
What do we see now befoie our eyes'* Is there not more
than one membei on tins floor who, notwithstar ding he voted
for both the Bank bilis pa^eJ at this session, takes sides with
the President m this conti ovei=y, am' is rea ly to thank him for
the interposition of his royal pie c -ttive, by which his own
votes in favor of measuiea deemed jnst and necessaiy have
been set aside? No, sir, as long as the Piesident has places of
hoi or and emolument to benow, just co long the provision in
the Consu' ution whicb lequit es a vote of two thirds of each
House of Congress to give a bill the foiv.e rf law will remain
piactic. lly a mere nullity nd just so long the P esident, jf he
have Pe power claimed for him, may control the wnoie legis.
latino of this vast Republic
Tne views of the writei of ihe pimphlet just referred to, I
regret to perceive, have bpen adopted, dndneaily in ¡he same
language, by the Piesidei t, m his menage now uidei Gonsi
deration And this sniidaiity of thought and expre -ion
might justly enough had to the suspicion that the pamohlet
and message had a common origin pi at least'hat a cl ise and
ir tímate íelaiion subsisted between the authois. Ihe President
says
' I readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the
Chief Magistrate is invested, should be regarded, and was in-
tended by the wise men who made a a i ait of the Constitution,
as a ere it conservative punciple of our ^y-tem without the ex
pi lion of which, on important occasions a meie representative
majoiuy rmsrbt uige the Government in its legislation beyond
the lima-fixed by Ms fiameis, or might rxert itsjust powers
too hastily oi oppressively) > * t it is a power which ought to be
cautious y exerred, and peihaps never, except in a case
eminently involving the public inteiest, oi one in which the
oathofihe President, ictn« under his convictions, both mental
and moral, m penously requne3 r& exeici^e ' "Mere regaid
to the will of a majority must not, in a cons ltutional republic
like oun contiol this eaciea aid so cmn duty uf a sworn offi
cpi " ' It must he exerted against the will 01 a meie íeprese 
tative maioi ity, or not at all "
The Piesident leathly admitb" that'he veto power is the
"gie it conservative pnncinlp of oi r system " Well may he
admit what he would have lotuul a very difficult task to
prove For I admit no such thine, but, on the con'iaiy,
a^seit t'i it the veto power has become what it was feare 1 it
would be, the great dbturhmg "principle ol our system,"
and out of al1 harmony wnli is otheiwi^e well adjusted pro
poitions Put, then if the pow r wue nt t exereifed on sreat
occasions the Piesident says tint a 'mere iepret.entative
rridjonty," yeb, a majorit} in boll Houses of Congress, lepre^
6«ntmg the people and the States, mt«ht violate the Con~-ti-
tution And so hey nmfbt but i«í there not as much dan-
gerthat the Executive may overleap the barriers of the Con-
eututmn in exercising the powers vested in him, as th^re IB
that the represen latí ves will violate it in executing the pow*
era confided to them? May not a Piesident employ even the
cherished veto power itself contraiy to the end and design for
which it was given, and in violation of the spirit and intention
of the Constitution? This he may do m the sacred rarne of
duty an 1 conscience, from the want of knowledge and ajust
perception of what is duty in the particular case And cer-
tainly it must be admitted that infiacuous of the Constitution,
committed through lenorance or mistake are not less injunou 
to the public interest than if perpetrated with a criminal de-
sum But whosi likely to stride over the bounds of the fun-
dament d law as those wh' , relying on then own preconceived
opinions, have resolved to administer the Constitution justas
they understand it not caring for the solemn adjudications of
our court-3 of justice, or ti e "views" and examples" of the
fithers? The message enumeiatesseveial cases in which the
veto power may he exerted, and one m which he says, "the
oath of the Pres dent, aciing under hts convictions, both men*
tal and moralt imperi >usly íequires us exetcise "
Well, but do not the Representatives lake an oath to defend
the Const tution and have they not ' convictions, both mental
and mora ," as weM as the Piesident? Do they not act under
responsi11 it es and saicti ns of a cbarac er as <-acrpd and im-
posing as any that ate binding on the President? The language
of the Pi evident seems to say that Congress is not as compe ent
a judge ofthe Constitution, or as safe a depositary of the nublic
trus' and confidence as the Exet utive Whether he means to
«ay this or not, still it is t1 e language of the one man power
ftom the beginning of the world
Now, sir, I do not hesitate ¡o say that the people have been
most grussly imi o-ed upon by the manner m wich the veto
power has been exercised It has been carried to <• . extent ^ind
exerted wnh a frequency not ioreeeto. or expee ed by the
framers ofthe Constitution, and it is time its pretensions were
examined, its arrogance chastened, at d its exereise restrained
within constitutional bounds When royal rreiogativeBpeak6,
the will of a mi?hty i anon is i -dsied, and Congress uself is
brought to the foot of an alien power
I shall now call the attention of ti e House and country, for
a few minutes to the grounds upon which M¡ Tyler has exei
Cised the veto power during the present se sjon of Congress
And, in the first place, let us seem what re'ation he s ands to
tne n easure he has twice vetoed To do this, it will not be
necessary to go Itnther b¿ck than to the lOh of Apal last,
when he published his Inaugural Add esstothe American peo
pie    In that address he u^eu the following language
Ishall promptly give rrv *at ctio Ho any eonsu utionaijjiea*

"In deciding upon the adapfahon of any suchfmeasure to the
