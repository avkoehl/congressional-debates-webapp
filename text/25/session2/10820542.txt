iered for the teim of •— ye it*, should be relinquished to the
States, seveially,in which they aie ¡situated "
On the 22 í oí December, 1 submi ted the tallowing resolution,
to be printed, stating at the tune tnat I should move it eithei as
asubsutineor asan amendment to the resolution offered by the
gentleman from Alabama, when h s resolution should come up
lor consideration, viz
*' Resolved, Thita co umittee of one Itorn each State be ap
pointed by the Chair, to inquire into the propnety of íeporting
a, bill to appiopnate, loi the purposes oí íieetchools academies,
and the puiposes ofeducan n, anmceascd poition tfthe pub
lie lands foi the benefit oí all the ¡sutes and Turneries '
On motion of a member fiom Vngmia, Oil Mercer,) a lew
days  ago, the resolution ol the gentleman Uotn Alaba i a was
referred to the Committee of the Whole on the sta e of tie
Union, and the resolution which I have had the hon-sr oí oí
Jering now takes piecedeuce m the House
Prom this encttmstanco, the whole older of ti e debate be
came changed
I had flattered myself that, befoie I should tiouble the House
with any remark!), í would have ptohted by the aiguments of
the able membei who submi ted the fust, lesolunon,* and of
th >se members of this. House who advocate a induction ol the
puce oí the public 1 mds, and a surrender of them to the Mates
in which they lie, but, in tead oí coming in at the eleventh houi
in support ol what I intended to oflei as a substitute, I am un
espectedly torced to lead m this discussion
I shall not make my lermrks nure laMgumg, by a tre pass
upon the time of the Hotioe with a long apol tjcy for ofiering
Ihem, but, in oidei to present the proposition which 1 have
made in moie definite rum , I must lequest the Clerk to read
the following i evolutions, which I beg leave to o'ler as a mod
jtfication of the i evolution now under consideiation
Resolved^ That each of the United Mates has an equal light
to participate in the benefits of the public lands, the common
property of the nation
Resolved, That each of the States in whose favoi Concriess
has not made appiopnations oi land foi the purposes oí cauca
tion is entitled to such appiopnations as will coirespond, m a
¡ust proportion, with those heieloioic mate m favoi oi othei
S ates
Resolved, That the Committee of--------report a bill mak
mg an increased appropriation ol the public land%the property
of ihe United States, yet unippropuated, to all the & atea and
Territories of ih^Umon, lot u epuiposes of free schools, acad
t mies, and the promotion and diffusion of education m evejy
p trt ol the United States
U is my purpose to be as biief as I may, in the examination
of the subjects embraced m the resolution", and their impor
tance must plead my excuse il I shou'dfatigue the attention of
the House They are of great and impoitant m eiest, am1, m
my apprehension, no propositi ms could be f ubmnted n the
consideration of Congress which would hau hi* ei c «. m lo
urge them upon the earnest attention ol e\eiy menu ei in tms
hall Not only are the gtneial in titsis oleveiy State deeply
conceintd buf Í maintain that the individual in erest ol eveiy
citizen m the Union is most obviously involved 1 hen,as a
question of either individual ctnceinment oi as a subject ol
national policy, the di&tuhuuonof the pub ic lai ds aa r ropo-ied
by the lesolution , addresses lt^eli to he calm andd apasiónate
deliberation of all
Not being allowed the benefit o the < nl aiguments which
may be ofFeied id suppoit ni t!ie pmposu on t ueduce the pine
ef the public lands, I have devoted as much time at,l ctuid con
trol, i  the mufti ariuus labois I have had to peifuim, in ex
amintngthe printed reports which tiw been made .it v uu us
times by the Committeeb on the Public Lands The con-
mitteeof thepiesent Congiesshave already made a shoitrc
pint in the subject, which comprises the views of foi n ei com
matees, and, in some i expects, the piense phuseobg) i d
arguments
1 will first examine the report maOV on this subject by (he
committee oi the 23d t ongress, as it is moie ^ompieber^ive
and elaborate, and waspiepiredby thectuirmm who n« nee
hl'ed the most dis inguished places wi Inn the gilt if jus Mate,

" That the committee have felt it their dut> to look m o the
origin of the claim of the United "states to the public domain,
the better to compie1 end the motives aid inducements to the
various cessions which were made by the "sutes having claims
io Western lands, and the obligations incurred by the Gei eral
Government undfr those compacta    It is from this source that
* After my speech was delivered Mi Lawler obtaine 1 the
floor in support ofhis lesolutioa and tn in&wei to ihobe offeied
by myself, and my remaik-- upon them He occupied a portion
oí the morning hum and the following da) moved that ü e i cs
olutions whith I offeied should take the same direction whith
his hid, and thcietore mo\f d then íefeienct o the Committee
of the Wuole en ihe state oi the I n on ^ that both pioposmo is
r¿ulu be discussed fully it the san e time and withoutsiich fre
quent mteuuptums, when he wou d com] tete his remarks
which motion bygenerii conser t, prevo* el
I deem it due, undet the cncumsa"vJcs md to my own rcel

who was intercepted by death in the must oí hi* publ c career
and before he had concluded hi-, speech which prom s 1 to

The report then illudes to the mannei in \\\ leh the General
Government has acquned ita claim to the Weo em damain, and
fina ly comes to the ^lsmifkant conclusion that the Wet-tern
States would now, perhaps, ' be leluctant to raise the question"
of the Go\ eminent a right to the Y\ estern land

In taking a buef notice of the past, my object will be to present
some substantial pnnci,j w upon which thib bubject iest&, and
to explain, m some degiee, the reasons for the deep interest
which Maryland, as well as others of the old States, has always
taken in the honoiabte and fair adjustment of eveiy controvei &y
relating to the Wt stein land^ It is liesh m the lecoilecnon of
the hibtoricat íead^i, that at one time the en ire country north
ol the Gulf of Mexi o, to the present n Jithern bourida.iy ol the

and hut little known The extent of the grants was unknown,
for the magnitude of thi& continent was not compiehended at
that time in Europe <U the date ol those grants, the South sea
was thought to approach rear the Atlantic and no one i magined
that, hi this latitude, it was some thiee oi four thousand m !es
distant Sir jTiancis Diake had seen the I'acfic and Atlantic

proximity of the two seas was supposed to be tlie sa.nie al msr \

fiom Maine to Florida, tne whole seacoast was (if I may be al

with charters to various individuals and companies fiom dif

the nght of discovery, of possession, or of conquest

By the treaty of 17b3, between England and Fiance, the Mis

and, m a most masurly and irresistible aigument, instructed

lelmqui^h their unjust pretensions In their msuuctions, the
General Assembly of Maiyland say to their delegates that—
Having conieired upon you a trust oí the highest nature,
it is evident we place gieat confidence in your mtegiity, abil
ities, and zeal to promote the general welfare oí the Urued
States, and the particular interest of this state, where the latter
is not incompatible with the former, but to add greater w eight
to youi pioceedmgs in Congress, md take away all suspicions
that the opinions you theie delivei, and the votes you give,

your knowledge of the t>ent,e and dehoerate judgmer t of tie

fortunately, a supposed aifference of interest has product*1 an
almost equal division of sentiment among the several States

ca'arai le , the dread of their contit uarce, irom the appearance
oi disunion, and ^ome other peculiar circumstances, may have
induced some States to accede to the pjesent confederation,
contrary to their ow<? interests and judgment", it requires no
