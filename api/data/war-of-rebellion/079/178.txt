your trains, but leave the regiment working on the railroad. Try and cross the Etowah River to-night. Kingston must be reached to- morrow. Whichever corps reaches the Allatoona Pass first will first pass through. If you overtake any column on the road, find some side road, so that you may pass around it.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Carteresville, October 10, 1864.

General SLOCUM,Atlanta:

I have no objection to your sending a strong force, going toward the south. There is some forage on South River southeast of Atlanta. At least a DIVISION should go, and a hundred wagons will be enough to risk. Hood is crossing the Coosa, twelve miles below Rome, and I cannot yet make out it he intends to go over to the Tennessee or to turn up toward Chattanooga. Nothing from Virginia in.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
