THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 17,
sand tons of foreign iron would then consume
on an average $11,632 50 worth of American
products, the balance of food being of foreign
origin.
In the production of one ton of railroad iron
in the United States there is consumed a value
of $18 68 of agricultural produce, and $10 07
of American manufactures. Apply these figures
to one hundred thousand tons of American
railroad iron, and we find it gives our agricul-
tural and manufacturing interests a market for
$2,865,000; or, in other words, we find that
a hundred thousand tons of American rail-
road iron pay into the national Treasury full
§30,000 more, and to our farmers and manu-
facturers $2,000,000 more than the same quan-
tity of foreign iron. Strongly as this calcula-
tion illustrates our loss, it falls below the actual
fact.
But let us east a glance at England. Great
Britain thought by free trade and cheap labor
she would undersell the world. She did not
forget, however, to protect her beer-makers by
a duty of sixty-two cents per bushel on malt,
and of five dollars a barrel on beer.
Let us see how the free-trade system works
there.
We read in the Manchester Guardian, in the
very seat and center of those views :
•"There is unquestionably a reaction against free
trade. Yes, a remarkable and instructive reaction
is goingon in England; tiio force of hunger is pow-
erful and the working classes are forming associations
against free trade, known as 'revivers of British
industry.'"
A letter in the Sheffield Telegraph says :
"It is no wonder people are complaining of bad
times when wo s'and in the position in winch wo
htand now. In 1854 the total excc?s of imports over
Hiitish exports was £55,204,027. In 1SG0 this excess
had readied £94,539,646, anil m 1-SiiS it had amounted
to the ruinous sum of X116.012,922, more than the
whole of our textile manufactures exported to the
world: giving a balance a:ainst us in our foreign
trade of £116,000,01)0 sterling in one single year.
"At the piesent moment aboufconc in every eight-
een persons \n England and Wales is in receipt of
parochial relief. 'I'herowas paid for pauperism in
18(58 the sum of £7,500,000 sterling." •' 8    
" Since 1S53, upward of three millions of our people
have emigrated and principally to extreme protect-
ive countries, where their labor has found a bettor
1 eward, but at tlio umo time has been the means of
greater foreign productiveness. Wo liavo tried free
trade so long that it is almost tune to protect our- i
selves."
And now a word on wages. Mr. Hewitt,
commissioner to the Paris exhibition, sent by
our Government to examine into iron and steel
matters, says the difference in cost of iron-
making here and in England is in the wages,
which are more than double here. And even
the Special Commissioner of the Revenue
admits in his reportof 18G8 that they are on the
average by more than sixty per cent, higher
than the English wages; but lie attempts to
make out that, considering the cost of living,
the working man is not better off here than
in England. This we believe when we find
as many children in our poor-houses as in
our schools, when the tide of immigration,
made up of working men, ceases to flow,
and when one in twenty of our population is a
pauper.
But such calamities I trust are not in reserve
for our glorious country. Commissioner Wells
presents in his report of 1868 comparative ta-
bles of wages in Great Britain and the United
States; but he neglects to extend his compar-
ison over other European countries, and he is
silent to the fact that his averages, although
they may be bona fide in figures, represent
incorrect results, considering the small num-
ber of laborers receiving high wages and the
much larger number of those receiving low
ones, and also considering the number of re-
turns from which these averages are made up.
Granting, however, even these averages, the
following table comparing the wages paid in
three European countries with those paid in
the United States must inspire every American
heart with pleasure and pride over the more
liberal reward which labor finds in our country
than in Europe.

unskilled labor, excluding foremen, overseers, and
clerks, in eighteen branches of industry in Prussia,

But these figures also fall short of represent-
ing the true difference between the condition
of the laborer, skilled or unskilled, here and
abroad.
Wheii the fact is considered that, with the
exception of a few cases of extraordinary skill
and endurance, the European journeyman
mechanic cannot earn more than his own
scanty support; that he cannot marry and
support his wife without the assistance of her
own labor; that tho combined industry of hus-
band and wife cannot maintain a family not-
withstanding the so-called cheap prices of liv-
ing ; when it is known that in the majority of
these families the lowest comforts of life are
unknown, and food, like meat, tea, coffee, and
sugar, are only extraordinary relishes ; when
it is acknowledged that in entire sections and
regions subsistence means nothing but bad
food, scanty fuel, and scarcely a roof over the
head for weeks, months, and even years ; then
the difference between our country and Europe
may be appreciated by our laboring mechanics
and those there, and the claim for protection
of industry against free trade will be thoroughly
understood.
We are now gradually filling the vacant
spaces which were left in the ranks of our
mechanics by the heroic victims of the late war.
The South, by bountiful crops, is rapidly re-
covering her wealth, and by the blessings of
free and honored labor has already doubled
her energy. If, then, by a healthy tariff we
strengthen our northern and build up our south-
ern industry, there is no doubt that before a
great while we will astonish the world by our
industrial and commercial expansion, as well
as by our political progress and power.
But, having already devoted much of my time
to remarks on interests of general concern for
our national industry, I may be permitted to
say a few words in recognition of the claims of
a staple for which nature has selected Penn-
sylvania as one of its largest depositories, and
which, by its tributary and reciprocalfunctions,
forms one of the most indispensable factors of
'all commercial and industrial pursuits. 1 mean
coal, and will not enlarge upon the versatility
of its use, but simply remind you of the fact
that our steamboats and railways almost en-
tirely depend upon its plentiful and cheap sup-
ply; in brief, that next to labor, coal is the
most necessary requisite of our progress.
Some of the English mines are nearly if not
quite exhausted. Soon we will be called upon
to supply other parts of the world, and even
now we must have more and cheaper coal at
home. There is no article in the world the
demand of which will increase so steadily and
certainly, because there is no agent more pow-
erful for the diversification of industry and all
intercommunication of commerce.
Let us therefore protect and advance itspro-
duction ; let us open new mines on every spot
where nature has placed them, and not impede
its production where it is in encouraging prog-
ress.
It would be as narrow-minded economy and
as injurious a legislation to enact measures
checking the prospects of the iron and coal
industry, beeuase Pennsylvania derives greater
profits therefrom for a time than other States,
as it would be to retard the gold and silver
production because California or Colorado has
now the greatest share of its benefits.
If the tariff must be changed to relieve the
burden of taxation upon our citizens, I am in
favor of reducing it on articles which do not
interfere with the progress of our industry. I
repeat, that I wish to lessen the load forced
upon our tax-payers by the enormous expenses
of our late war, and if our budget should per-
mit, I am in favor of reducing the taxation at
once byfifty millions; but I wish to see the
benefits of such legislation equally distributed
among all classes. I do not want to reduce the
wages of the laborer by taking off a portion of
the imposts protecting him, and therefore would
suggest that at least thirty millions be taken
from our internal revenue taxes, which weigh
oppressively upon all, and more severely upon
the poor.
And conclusively, if the tariff must be re-
duced, let it be done on tea and coffee.
The protective tariffs of 1824,1828, and 1842
extinguished the national debt. The same
result will speedily followprotection hereafter.
The restoration of cashvalues will be accom-
plished without the derangement of business
harmony. There will be a continued apprecia-
tion of tho currency, with financial confidence
and a rapid increase and healthy competition
in the products of coal, cotton, wool, sugar,
and manufactures.
Add to these a careful collection of the rev-
enues, with economy in public expenditure,
aided by a progressive spirit of intelligence
and unity of purpose, and in twenty years wo
shall compete against the world in every de-
partment of art, mechanical ingenuity, agri-
cultural enterprise, and scientific attainment.
Mr. TOWNSEND. I wish to say a few
words on the bill before the committee. I do
not intend to go into the details of the bill, bat
rather to discuss the general principles which
should prevail in this country in raising rev-
enue by levying duties on imported merchan-
dise.
_ The Committee of Ways and Means have
given their earnest attention and intelligent
labor to the details. They have considered
them day by day, week by week, nay, manth
by month, and having patiently heard all par-
ties who had anything to say concerning the
separate articles in tho bill, they have presented
their conclusions to the Representatives of the
people. With those conclusions I agree, except
in a very few and perhaps unimportant particu-
lars, and expect, therefore, to give my support
to the measure; but before recording my vote
T wish to say something in reference to the
principles which have guided the committee to
their conclusions. The chairman of that com-
mittee informed us some time ago, if I remem-
ber aright, that they had kept in view three
principles:
1. The raising of revenue.
2. Such discrimination in levying duties as
to protect and. encourage American industry.
3. Such adjustment of duties as would make
them as light as possible on the consumer of
imported productions.
The principle of protection is as old as man.
It is innate. It is that instinct which induces
the head of a family to succor and protect his
offspring in their early helplessness and to aid
and encourage them in their adolescence. If
the head of a family has work to be performed,
if he gives that work to the members of his
family instead of to a stranger, that family finds
employment at fair wages, the labor is per-
formed at home, and its products and the
wages for it remain within the family. But if
