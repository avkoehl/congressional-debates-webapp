Numbers 137. Report of Surg. Silas H. Kersey, Thirty-sixth Indiana Infantry, Acting Brigade Surgeon.

HEADQUARTERS MEDICAL DEPARTMENT THIRD BRIGADE.

January 9, 1863

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to transmit the following list of casualties suffered by your command in the recent series of engagements with the enemy before Murfreesborough, to wit:*

Before closing this report, permit me, respectfully, to call attention to the faithful manner in which the regimental medical officers of the several regiments composing the Third Brigade have discharged the arduous duties incumbent on them under circumstances the most trying, viz: T. S. Bayse, assistant surgeon Thirty-sixth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, was assigned the duty of administering anaesthetic, which he has so far accomplished in every operation without producing any untoward symptoms in a single case, and at the same time attended to the

dressing of all the slighter wounds of his own regiment, thus performing double duty by day and night since the commencement of the battle.

I would also make honorable mention of A. M. Morrison, assistant surgeon Twenty-third Regiment Kentucky Volunteers, who was appointed to keep the register, which necessarily occupied a large portion of his time, notwithstanding which by constant industry and energy, his wounded have been well cared for.

Assistant Surgeon McDill, of the Eighty-fourth Illinois, had so large a list of wounded that his time has been almost wholly occupied with them: they, too, have been as well attended as circumstances would permit.
