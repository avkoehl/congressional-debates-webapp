What they have purchased has not been paid for, and I suppose never will. We have 40,000 good fighting men that are cut off by the lines of the enemy. Let them be released by driving out the enemy, and I guarantee that we will raise 10,000 troops there to defend that country.

Hoping that you and the President will immediately take this matter under consideration, I am, very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

T. S. HAYMOND.

[Indorsement.]

I reside in the northwestern part of the State, and fully agree with General Haymond in his opinions and concur in his suggestions.
