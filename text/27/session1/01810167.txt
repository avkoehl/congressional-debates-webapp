and South Caí olma, Mr It did not believe that their interests
were in the least degree antagonistic Let each be content to do
as well as it could, and they might long live id harmony and
peace The same was true of the South and the North Their
interests harmonized—the North furnished to the South that
beat of ail markets in the wor d—a domestic market—and
the South furnished them the raw material, nor was
there a man at the South who would not infinitely prefer to
wear a suit of American manufacture to being dependent for
his clothing on any nation on earth provided the Constitution
was not mvad.. I to make him tubutary to the manufac'mer
This was their feeling—it pervaded the whole South, but they
could not give up then rights—their pude, their interest,
their duty, alike lot bade it Give us, said Mi R the Consti
tution, mat is all we ask, we want no more, and we will not
take less
Mi FESSENDEN expressed his satisfaction at listening to
the utterance of such opinions in such a quartet His mind had
been greatly relieved by it, but he legretted to find when the
gentleman came to explain, that all his attachment to the Consti
tution and the Union hung upon this condition, that every body
else mustadopthis peculiar views of the Constitution, and ab
stain from the exeicisc of every powei concerning which he en
tertained a doubt \\ hen c osely looked at, this wasbut nullifi
cation in another foi m Howevei, as the time he had to speak
was so very limited, he would not pursue that subiect fur
ih«
Mi T then wont into asta istical examination of thegrounds
on which the bill tested, and spoke in its defence with much
earnestness, and foice oi argu  . n He called for prool in sup
port ol the leasibility of the 1 m^ 1st oí retienchments wlmh
had been piesented by Mi Picktss He had all piopet re
spect for that gentleman, but could not accept of his naked opi
nion as sufhcitnt evidence on a question of ihls kind Mi F
had no patience for that sou of economy which would save mo
ney by refusms appropriations e obvious and pressing necessi
ty, which would suffei our fortifications to goto decay, our
harbors to remain defenceless and oui navy lo fall into dilapi
dation, lathei than apnropn- e the money necessary to meet the
expense of these gieat and impoiiant public works Should a
war arise, the people would pionounce it a poor and niggaidly
spirit, which toi fear oí asking foi the money necessary lo he
expended, liad left them defenceless to their enemies
Mr F inveighe I with warmth against the couise oí the last
Administration Hi suffering a public debt to accumu ate, and
then denou icing their suocessois because they brought that
d bt to view and took measures to pay it He strongly argued
the necessity of a loan by showing that there was no íeasonabie
prospect of a speedy increase ol revenue—in pmnf of which
he went into an examination of the statistics of Government
receipts, which would not exceed thuteen and a half millions,
while sixteen millions would be wanted to meet the ordinary ex
penses ot Government He went into a compaiison oí the ad
vantages of a loan an 1 of Tteasury notes, waimly advocating
thefouneras avoiding all mystification and pie ennng to the
people a true view ol Iheii affairs He scouted the tflected
horror of gentlemen on the othei side at the idea ol incurring a
national debt while they themselves had cieated it, hidden it
from the eye of the people uli lei peiplexed and unintelligible
repoits fiotn the lieasuiy,and then turned ito\erasa legacy
to the present Administration As to State lights, they were not
in the least danger, the Repiesentatives- of the people would
naturally love the lights of then Riates He had much grea ei
apprehension foi ihe ruhts of Congiess under the Constitution,
ami had indeed been waning to h ai some stiai^ht laced State

Mr. KING called up his motion made «orne days
since to reconsider the vote ordering the document
relating to the commerce and navigation ot the
United States lo be printed.
Mr. K. requested the older would be read which
had been made in the Senate la*t s ssion, in rela-
tion to the printing of the document.
The Secretary of ihe ¡Sena'e read the order.
Mr KING remarked that it was plain the order
was intended to be executed in the customary way,
by the then Printer of th> ¡Senate, during the re-
cess, and two thousand additional copies struck
off. It was supposed, the document being long
and impjuant, that it could not be furnished
by the Secietary of the Treasuiy till sometime in
the recess, it was lor his convenience that the timo
was mentioned in the orler Ii has been ih  uni-
form practice of both Houses of Congress, for the
printer of ihe session at which any order lo print is
made, to execute that printing, even when the time
in which it is done runs into the next session Had
the Secretary of the Treasury delivered the annual
statement of commerce and navigation to the Se-
cretary of the Senate, there would have been to
question as to the right of the Primers ot last ses-
sion being entitled to print, the mere delivery of
ihem to Congress in ss>is on could male no diffe-
rence in principle
Mr HUNTINGTON said that, in justice to
Messr0. Blair and Rives be fell bound to call for

Respectfully,
T.AIR & RI\ ES
Mr HUNTINGTON said he undi r tood the mo-
tion of ihe Senator from Alabama to reconsider ihs
resolution ordering the present Printer of ihe Se-
nate to print the document, had for it* object, thai
m case that resolution should be reconsidered, the
document should be printed by ih: Printers of last
session He would wish the order of last session
to be Egam read, [ft was read by the Secretary
of the Senate as belon  ] It ts supp W the error
consis'ed in the Secretary of the iVcasuty si tiding
the document litre, instead of to the Secreiary of
the Senate This he (Mi H ) considered no mis
take at all The power of the Secretary of the Se-
nate of last Congress to receive ihe document, had
ceased before the day onwnlehtie Secreiary of
the Treasury was ready to forward 't foi printing,
and therefore it would have been improper to hand
them to him.
Mr. KING said he had no other desire m this mat-
ter than that of having the business set right, and of
preventing any precedent being established for
departing from ihe usual course of practice
with regard to the printing. It could not be
di gutsed that the object was to take ihe
pnn mg from the Printers of the last Congress, and
giien it to (he Printer !atp|y employed by tin* St-
nate That ihe printing of these papers belonging
to the Printers of the last Congress, canrot be ques-
tioned, for it was ordered to be printed by theur,
and in the order, the recess mentioned could not
have alluded to a recess between that session and
an exira sess on not then contemplated If the do-
cument had been communicated to the Senate last
sess on, and laid over till now, would tt i ot ot right
be parte i by the Printers of that se won' No one
can believe that when the cder was made it was
intended by Ih.nse who made it, and who had th"
righ' lo make it ihat ihe Printers then employed
weie nit to i xcule that on er
Mr PHELPS exr lamed his understanding of
the difference between ihe two Senato s. He was
fice to confess ihat n his mind, ne, her the oraer
to print, nor the t'elay 11 the delivery 11 the docu
mem for pnnun;, coe, d be construed to give any
riüht to this ses-ion to fake away ihe printing frem
i' e Print..- s of the se sion in which the order was
mad'. There appeared to him to be much
power m the (act that no extra e*ssi n
could be t-ken m'o view, and therefore
the rtces meant was ihat which, ¡n the ordinary
<ase, would have extended to next December.
Bui, in ad 'íuon to ihis.it was a document belong-
irg to the .iroceedmgs of last session, and ire pro-
per place for it to be placed, was in the vo ume ot
those proceedings now preparing He saw no
just reas n to depart from the usual practice m
such ca es. I was ?  unll matter, but even if it
was not, he for one «ould not give the gemleman
op the other side an opportunny for imputing to
his side a decision against equity and upon a
mere technicality.
Mr. WOODBURY referred to the session of
1834 A)i acá e in point.
Mr. HUNTINGTON said he «att no t'te s'lght-
est feeling in thj mat er He had thought ¡t h>s
duty to iake the part he had taken in it, lecause ht
consi 'ered it ímposs-iD e for me Señale of this se -
sion to enteitainany c nnec ion witti iheSenale ol
last C ngress in what w.'s not a bu-'ness of neees
sar ' connet t on.
The question to reconsider was then unammou -
ly  agreed to, and'he question coming up on  tht
motion ot  Mr. Huntington to print,  by gene al
consent he vas perm.tied lo withdraw it
