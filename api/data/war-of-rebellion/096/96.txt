HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,January 11, 1865.,

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: While visiting my picket-line this afternoon I became aware of an attack upon the troops of the First Division of this corps while on their return from a foraging tour. I immediately investigated the affair and received the inclosed reports from Brevet Major-General Griffin, commanding division. The attack took place about one-fourth of a mile beyond Warwick Swamp on the Jerusalem plank road, while the party consisting of about 250 was returning. Information was received from citizens that two camps of the enemy's cavalry were located in the vicinity of the place of attack. The attacking party consisted of about twenty. The affair has been reported to the commanding officer of the cavalry division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Fifth Army Corps

General Gregory, as I understand, passed out subsequently with a party to recover the body. Please call upon General Griffin for a report in regard to this affair.

Respectfully, yours,
