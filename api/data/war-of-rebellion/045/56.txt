HEADQUARTERS, FIFTH CORPS,June 11, 1863-9 a. m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

Telegram received and forwarded to General Barnes. One brigade and two batteries now at Kelly's Ford. General Barnes is ordered to re-enforce them. Don't think the enemy will try to force a passage in the face of this command, when there is no difficulty in their crossing with less opposition higher up. General Barnes was ordered last night to send deserters to headquarters Army of the Potomac. Presume they are now on their way here. Will question them when they arrive, though it is understood Barnes got out of them last evening all they knew. Should like to have the ideas of commanding general if enemy do cross, and some knowledge of the position and proposed movements of General Pleasonton's force.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
