HALF MILE FROM GAYLE'S HOUSE, May 9, 1864-7.15 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Found the enemy's vedettes one-half mile before reaching Gayle's house. They are retiring before my skirmishers.

GAYLE'S HOUSE - 8 a.m.

The enemy show considerable force of cavalry and, I think, infantry, but it is hazy, and I am not sure. Their skirmish lines are deployed as though they meant fight.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.
