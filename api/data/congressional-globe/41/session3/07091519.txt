He came into office as a laborer at $300 per an-
num by the terms of his appointment, did no more
work than any other of the laborers, and received
his pay regularly and promptly. He himself made
no complaint during this period that he was entitled
to any extra allowance, nor does he so claim until
the year 1857 as having done anything more than
was usual and customary.
XJpon what ground, then, the committee extend
their gratuity throughout the term froml850to 1857,1
cannot imagine. The claim, when presented,should
havp been, as is usual, referred to the Department
where Syphax was employed, and in that case these
facts would have been made known to the committee.
Further, the truth of Syphax's memorial isdenied.
He did not have the supervision of the distribution
of documents, as he claims. Mr. Thomson, when the
duty of this distribution devolved by law upon the
Department of the Interior, appointed John II.
Wheeler to perform the duty of superintending this
work, at a salary of a fourth-cla^s clerk, and added
as his assistant Mr. Wallingsford, a first-class clerk.
These gentlemen performed the duty Syphax claims
now to be paid for. This, I am assured by Colonel
Wheeler, is the fact, and Mr. Syphax did no more
than the other laborers who were employed—that is,
he did as Colonel "Wheeler directed him, and the
responsibility rested alone upon Wheeler.
Summon or write to Colonel Wheeler, (who is now
a clerk in the Census Office,) and you will have from
him the exact facts, from his appointment, in 1857,
to his removal in 1861.
This whole matter is nothing to me personally;
but I will not sit quietly and witness the selecting
of one man to receive a gratuity from Congress with-
out making some effort to prevent what is not only
unjust to all the other employes of the Department
of the Interior, but an absolute squandering of the
public money.
I have hastily thrown these facts together thatyou
may the better understand what I previously men-
tioned to you in conversation. You are likewise
referred to the Comptroller's report.
Very respectfully,
WM. HEMPHILL JONES.
Hon. J. B. Beck.
Mr. BECK. I have here also a statement
of the account of William Syphax. I will not
consume the time of the House by having it
read. I ask that it be printed in the Globe.

it will be so ordered.
There was no objection; and it was ordered
accordingly.

Mr. BECK. Last year this_ House passed
an appropriation similar to this, being "for
official pay heretotore withheld from William
Syphax, to equalize his compensation," &c.
At that time the committee and the House were
led to believe that the amount appropriated
had been improperly withheld from him. The
matter was submitted to the First Comptroller
of the Treasury, whose letter on the subject
has been read. The documents which the
House has just heard show clearly, I think,
that Syphax has been paid in full. I would
have laid this matter before the Committee on
Appropriations had I received these commu-
nications in time. I think that this para-
graph ought to be struck out. If on further
examination it should appear to be proper it
can be inserted in the Senate.
Mr. DAWES. Mr Speaker, after the read-
ing of the letter from the First Comptroller, I
do not resist the motion of the gentleman from
Kentucky. The attempt last year was to make
the compensation of William Syphax equal to
that of an assistant messenger at the present
time. After hearing these papers, I have no
doubt that he was paid at the time what he
could get; but it was during a time when a
black man was considered as having "no rights
which a white man was bound to respect."
Yet, after the letter of Mr. Tayler, I cannot
resist the motion of the gentleman from Ken-
tucky.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I had no knowledge of
the letter of the First Comptroller until it, was
read here. Of course I make no objection to
the motion of the gentleman from Kentucky.
Mr. BECK. The letter of the Chief Clerk
was not received by me until yesterday.
Mr. DAWES. 1 do not resist the motion ;
but when the matter is more fully examined,
I think my colleague on the committee [Mr.
Beck] will find that, although Syphax received
all he conld get and all that the Government
had agreed to pay him, it was during a time
when on account of his color he was compelled
to work for a far smaller salary than that paid
to white men for similar services.
Mr. ARCHER. I ask the gentleman from
Massachusetts whether this man, who was a
colored man, did not get exactly the same pay
that white men got who occupied the same
position?
Mr. DAWES. They paid the white men
three times as much.
Mr. ARCHER. I think by an examination
of the records the gentleman will find he is
mistaken.
The question was taken, and Mr. Beck's
amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
To enable the Secretary of the Interior to pay the,
freight on the law libraries authorized to be pur-
chased for each of the Territories of Idaho. Mon-
tana, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, by the act of
July 15.1870, §1,255, or so much thereof as may he
necessary.
Mr. FERRISS. I move to add the fol-
lowing :
For collecting statistics of mines and mining, to
be expended under the direction of the Secretary
of the Treasury, $1,500.
Mr. Speaker, the Secretary of the Treasury,
in his letter of estimates of deficiencies, in-
cludes the following recommendation :
Collecting statistics of mines and mining, to be ex-
pended under the direction of the Secretary of the
Treasury, (appropriated, 16 Statutes-at-Large, page
306. see. 1,) §1,500.
Note.—The Commissioner in his letter transmit-
ting this estimate, says: 4* The most important and
expensive part of my work this year has been the
exploration of the mining regions of Arizona. The
Governor and the Delegate of that Territory have
rendered me every assistance; but the business has
been a costly one, exhausting almost the surplus
funds at my disposal. If I have the means to carry
out the work in progress, the report tor 18/u will oe
as important, though not more than halt as bulk\,
as the one just printed." * * . " VL i
the liberty, therefore, of requesting earnestly that
the sum of $1,500 be inserted among the dchcncncy
estimates. . , li.n .liAi iuUxNIJ, n
Commissioner of Mining btatinticff,
Mr. LAWRENCE. I rise to a point of
order. There is no law authorizing that appro-
priation.
