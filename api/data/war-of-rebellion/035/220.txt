WASHINGTON, April 8, 1863-11.35 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your telegram of 5th, through War Department, has been received. I will be in Nashville in a few days, and will immediately thereafter meet you at any point that may be indicated, for the purpose of conferring with you fully and freely upon the subject and matter of your telegram. This, I think, will be more satisfactory to both. There has been nothing, there will be nothing desired by me but harmony and concert of action to put down this rebellion and restore to the people of Tennessee all their legal and constitutional rights; of this you know I have given assurance both in action and words.
