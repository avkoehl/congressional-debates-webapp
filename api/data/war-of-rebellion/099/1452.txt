General WHEELER:

GENERAL: The infantry is now across the bridge. After you destroy it keep a few vedettes up and down the creek till all is clear between the creek. There is a ford here. You can order Colonel Dibrell either to this point or he can fall back toward Smithfield. Yournote as to the wagon train just received. I should be glad for you to carry out the plan.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: I wish that you would move your command across the river early in the morning, leaving one brigade to coverthe line of march of the infantry. Direct the officer commanding that brigade to report to General Johnston, and when he follows us let him leave small scouting party. I will take Law across the river at once. If Hart's battery is on the road do bring it with you. Allen and Dibrell are on the Clinton road.

Very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Widow Mitchener's, Two miles from Smithfield, March 22, 1865-6. 45 p. m.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: General Hampton directs me to say that from the information he has received it will be necessary for you to move your command across the river as early as you can to-morrow morning. General Law will move down the river to-night on the river road, and General Hampton desires you to go on the road south of and near to the railroad, which road leads from Smithfield to Goldsborough. He desires you to reach and take position on Moccasin River if you can. General Law will endeavor to take position on the same stream on the river road. He also desies you to have some parties out on the north side of the railroad to observe if the enemy moves in that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General Hampton thinks it will be only necessary to keep one regiment on the west side of the Neuse River in rear of our infantry. Let that regiment keep out scouting parties. Cross at Turner's Bridge and take the nearest road to the road leading down the railroad. Bring Hart's battery to this side of the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
