MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., May 31, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

There are 200 men belonging to the Thirty-ninth Indiana and 400 more of Willich's brigade detained at Indianapolis. There are also large numbers in the aggregate now at other parole camps in the North belonging to my command who have been exchanged and yet I cannot get them back. Will you please issue orders to have them returned?

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., May 31, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I understand from the commissioner for exchange that Coburn's brigade and all the prisoners captured at Stone's River are exchanged. Sheridan alone reports 600 men not returned though exchanged. The habit appears to be to let them go home after exchange.

MEMPHIS, TENN., May 31, 1863.

Brigadier-General BUFORD:

Forty-four hundred prisoners and guard of 400 under Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding left here yesterday for Cairo. Provide transportation by railroad to Indianapolis for the whole, not to change cars if possible, and telegraph to officer in charge at Indianapolis at what time they will leave. Half of the men will remain at Indianapolis and half proceed to Fort Delaware, officers to Sandusky. The division will be made and rolls perfected at Indianapolis. Colonel Spaulding's guard will take them to their several destinations. You will see that they are properly provisioned and permit no intercourse between the prisoners and citizens. Give Colonel Spaulding copy of this dispatch.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
