HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 31, 1864.

Captain J. C. YOUNGMAN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that scouting parties sent out to-day found the enemy's pickets occupying light intrenchments in an open field, about three-quarters of a mile from our own picket-line, in front of my left brigade. In front of my right brigade their vedettes were found about a quarter of a mile from our own, with their main picket-line about 100 yards beyond. No firing occurred on either side. Copies of Special Orders, Numbers 32, headquarters Armies of the United States, were shown to the enemy's vedettes and left within a short distance of them in conspicuous places.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. HARTRANFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division,
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 31, 1864.

Brigadier-General POTTER, Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires me to say that General Hartranft will withdraw his left regiment (One hundred and seventy-ninth New York) for the purpose of occupying that part of the line left vacant by the removal of the Second Pennsylvania Provisional Heavy Artillery, and he desires you to extend your right so as to occupy the ground that will be left vacant by the withdrawal of the One hundred and seventy-ninth New York.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. YOUNGMAN,

A scouting party more to the right met their pickets on the further edge of the woods about one mile from our works. Camp-fires and shelter-tents were seen by the former party. I would respectfully suggest that the officer of the trenches straighten out the picket-line of the corps.

Very respectfully,
