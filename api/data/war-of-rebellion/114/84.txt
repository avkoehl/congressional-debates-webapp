Colonel WAITE, U. S. Army, Present.

COLONEL: I understand that Lieutenant E. L. Hartz, Eighth Infantry, visited Captain Lee's company on yesterday and exhorted them to be true to their allegiance to the United States, &amp;c. When I granted leave to visit the company I did not expect such a course would be pursued. I am compelled, therefore, to forbid any visiting, only tin company with an officer of the C. S. Army. When the men are to be visited Captain James Duff will accompany the officer, or some other officer will be detailed by him.

Your obedient servant,

S. MACLIN,

Major Infantry, C. S. Army, Commanding.

Very respectfully, sir, I am, your obedient servant,
