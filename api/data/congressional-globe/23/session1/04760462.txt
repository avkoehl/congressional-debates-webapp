IN SENATE.
Wednesday, June 18, 1834.
A message upon executive business was re-
ceived from thePiesident of the United States, by
Mi   Donelson, his Private Secretary.
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a commu-
nication fi om the War Depai tment, ti ansmitting a
statement relative to Indian tubes, which, on mo-
tion of Mi. TIPTON, was oideied to be punted.
The VICE PRESIDENT also pi esented a com-
munication from the Treasuiy Dtpartment, trans-
mitting, in compliance with a resolution of the
Senate, a statement of the monthly accounts of the
Bank of the United States, and the State banks
where the public moneys are deposited.
Mr. SMITH presented a petition signed by 736
citizens of Tolland county, Connecticut, praying
a íestoration of the deposites to the Bank of the I
United States, and therechaitei of said institution,
oi another, under certain modifications                     I
Mr  SMITH prefaced the piesentalion of the
memorial with a few remarks íelative to the dis- j
tiess complained of, and its causes                            ,
Mr McKEAN said he did not rise to inteifere j
with the prerogative of the honorable Senatorfrom j
Connecticut, nor would he obuude upon the Sen- I
ale his opinions of the merits or dements of the
memorial just presented by the honorable gentle- i
men. He had generally found it to be the best I
policy to mind his own business, butheconsideied I
the present a legitimate occasion, in pailmment-
ary order, as connected with the same subject, to
conect some misstatements which were going the
newspaper iound¡>, in leference to himself It had,
he knew not how, got into print that he should
have said m his place, as a Senator, that a majority
of the citizens of Pennsylvania weie opposed to
the removal of the deposites Now, heaveired,
in the face of the whole Senate, that he had never,
publicly or privately, said any such thing, noi
should he nowpiesume an opinion the one way or ¡
the other. What he had said on the subject was
stnctly confined to the opinions of the petitioneis
whose memonals he was at the time about to pie-
bent, and then only hi cases where he had been
by letter, or othtrwise, lequested todo so. Why,
sir, (said Mr McK ,) it might be consideied pie-
sumptuous, if not impertinent, for a Pennsylvania
Senator to venture an opinion on tins (looi, as to
the geneial political chatacter of that State, when
there are so many other gentlemen on e ther side
of thequesuon who seem to understand piecisely,
not only what the piesent sentiment of the people
of Pennsylvania now is, but wnat it will be in all
time to come, and from these erroneous state-
ments, it had been ungenerously inferred that he
(Mi McK ) was not quite as good a Jackson man
ab he ought to be. It was not, he said, because
lie was apprehensive, if this should leach the ears
of the Executive, that.tv/oul 1 deprive himself and
family of their daily bread, that he noticed it, Lut
he did not like to risk the injurious effects that
might result to his State and constituents, by thus
insidiously frittering away his welt known influence
with the piesenl ¿Mmmisticttion He had, on an-
other occasion, said he would vote to restoie the
deposites, not because he believed the íestoration
would affoid the desired rehef, but because a very
large mijonty of his constituents, who had ex-
pressed any opinion on the subject, had asked for
the restoiatioo of the depooites as a measure of
lelief, and foi so doing hehad been proscribed and
denounced as atraitoi by a certain well disciplined
corp«, who had ceassd not, day nor ni£;ht, to pur
sue him since a ceitam period m 1829 He d.d
not complain of this, veiy fai fiom it He ou ht
rather to rejoice For though he could, in tiuth,
boast of as true and faithful fuends as any man
ever had, he had long been convinced that his
enemies had rendeied him more essential service
than his fuel ds
But, ^said Mr. McK ,) how stands this case?
He held in his hand a statement, made by one of
the under secretaries,from the Senate files, show-
ing the number of individuals from Pennsylvania
who had petitioned that body to restore the depos-
ites, and also the number of those who had le-
monstrated against the restoration.   Th is mclud ed
ail  who had actually signed memonals, on both
sides, which had  been  presented to   the  Senate
during thepresent session fiom Pennsylvania, and
stands 'hus: from the counties of Union,  Cam
I bna, Northampton,  Cumberland, Montgomeiy,
Adams, Mifflin, Northumberland, Bedfoid, Sus-
quehanna, Chester, Delaware, Lycoming, Ilun-
1 tington, Lancaster, Fianklin, Schuylkill, Beiks,
i Alleghany, Philadelphia county and city, Pitts
burg, Moyamensirgand Sou'hwaik,Oxford, By-
I btny,Germantown, Waynesborougb, ramaque,
| Bustol, Pottsville, and Muncy creek, (towns and
I villages,) forty difieientmemonals,signed by thuly-
eiglU thousand and sever hundred «icemen of Penn
sylvania, complaining of distiess, and piaying for
the restoration of the deposites, and opposed to
this,  fiom Pennsylvania, are oix, and only six,
memorials from Philadelphia, Pittsbuig and the
county of Schuylkill, signed by only five hund) ed
and   beienty one individuals,   who   remonstrated
ag-unst the lestoiation of the deposites, exhibiting
a disparity of more thar sixty-seven to one, and an
aggregate majority of thirty eight thousand one
hundred and twenty nine in favor of lestonng the
deposites.    What is the duty of a faithful lepre-
sentative of tne people under such circumstant.ee, ?
Shall he, because all have not complained, lu n a
deaf ear to   thnty-nine thousand, who have laid
their pe itionsathis feet?  In giving hn vete for the
íestoiation of the deposites, he had not cououlted
the mere will of the Executive, nor that of any otn er
individual, nay, he had not consulted his own wil1
He wa3  what ha piofessed to be, the sincere
friend of Andiew Jackson, though he detes'ed
many of the reptiles that were basking in  the
beams of his effulgence,and withoutan authonty,
presuming to act and speak in his name     But
he was also on that flooi the humble representative
in part of the people of Pennsylvania, and if he
undei stood then inteiests, and knew then will on
questions of mere exped.ency, he would advocate
the one, and obey the other, please oi  displease
whom it might     He was a party man as fai as
conscience would permit     He abhorred and con
demned alike, a captious opposition, and a blind
and sycophantic devotion to any Administration
I     He desired to examine this a 1 ttle fin ther     He
had another statement, maae out by the same offi-
I cer, fiom the files of the Senate, which showed
í that theie have also been pi esented to the Senate
I fiom Pennsylvania resolutions and proceedings of
j thirty five meetings of the people in their pumary
assemblies     Also, eleven coiporate bodies, and
I lesolution and  pioceedmgs of one general State
convention, making in all foity seven—all recom-
mending that the  public deposites  be  lestored,
and, on the other side, there have been only reso-
lutions of twelve meetings of citizens opposed to
the íestoration presented to the Senate fiom Penn-
sylvania.
Supposing the question be tested exclusively on
paity ground, and let the friends of General Jack-
son only be heard, he was certainly within bounds
when he said, that of the 38 700 petitions, there
were at least 8,000 of them Geneial Jackson's
sincere friends, and veiy many of them his most
active snpporteis, and several of them, as well as
himself, were members of the electoral college in
1832, and gave him their votes. Then we have
8,0U0 against 571—about fourteen Jackson men in
favoi, to one Jackson man opposed, to the resto-
latton. So, considei it in what light you please,
enhei as a question of general expediency, or as
a puiely party question, his vote was correct—if
the wi'l of the people, as eypiesbtd, was to be
ronsidered at al' binding upon the representative
He had conscientiously 'istened to the complaints
of the peoj le, and if that be tieason, let his ene
mies make the most of it
The memorial was then referred to the Commit-
tee on Finance, and oideied to be pinned.
