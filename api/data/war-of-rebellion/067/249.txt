The battles around Cold Harbor consisted of a series of attacks upon strong lines of earth-works and our loss was relatively large. As the army did not move for several days after the chief engagement the medical department was enabled to properly care for and remove all of the wounded, and to keep the field supply full and unimpaired. The lack of medical officers, although still felt, was somewhat relieved by the return of those who had been left with wounded in the Wilderness and at Fredericksburg, while the facilities presented at White House for the rapid removal of wounded rendered it unnecessary to keep so large a part of the medical staff at the depot hospital as had before been requisite. Forty-eight new ambulances, eight Autenrieth medicine wagons, and the required horses and harness, were received during this period, and more than repaired all the losses experienced since the beginning of the campaign. When the army moved across the James the medical department was better organized and equipped than when it crossed the Rapidan, all the parts of the machine working so smoothly that the account of its operations becomes somewhat monotonous, as no variation or obstruction took place in its movement.

On the 31st of May Dr. Dalton, with the depot hospital staff and supplies, arrived at White House, on the Pamunkey River. Assistant Surgeon Mackenzie, U. S. Army, arrived at the same date, with two steamers and three barges filled with medical supplies, including the three-months' supply which had been required for on the 23rd of April. As the Eighteenth Corps had arrived, and occupied the country in front, Dr. Dalton was able to commence unloading his stores and establishing the hospital immediately, and as the banks of the river at this point are nearly perpendicular, it was found easy to bring the boats close inshore and to commence operations without waiting for the construction of wharves. The tents were pitched on a level plateau just below the ruins of White House, elevated about 20 feet above the surface of the river. The ground was low and flat, with marshy spots scattered here and there, and with few or no facilities for drainage; fortunately, however, the weather continued hot and dry during the time that the hospital continued at this point, and no difficulties arose from the unfavorable nature of the site. Springs in the river bank furnished an abundant supply of excellent water, and the supply boats were but a few yards distant. About 100 hospital tents were pitched by the following day. A train containing about 300 wounded from the
