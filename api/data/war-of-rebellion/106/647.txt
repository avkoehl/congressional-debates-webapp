" It has been the usual custom on the arrival of foreign ships of war in the harbor of San Francisco for the commander to communicate the fact to my headquarters, when arrangements have been made for an exchange of salutes. I can assure Your Excellency that the Government of the United States enjoins upon its officers to treat with the highest respect and courtesy foreign officers arriving on our shores, and this pleasant interchange of official courtesies between the high officers of friendly nations has a tendency to strengthen the bonds of friendship and the maintenance of a good understanding between their respective Governments.

With high respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
