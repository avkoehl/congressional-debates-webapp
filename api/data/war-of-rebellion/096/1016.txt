RICHMOND, VA., January 6, 1865.

His Excellency Z. B. VANCE,

Governor of North Carolina:

DEAR SIR: Your letter asking that General D. H. Hill be assigned to duty in North Carolina, or should it not be the purpose of the Department to assign him, that you propose giving him some employment, was received sometime since;* various causes have prevented an earlier reply. In the meantime General Hill has been ordered to report to General Beauregard for duty at or near Charleston, S. C.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Raleigh, January 6, 1865.

General ROBERT E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL: I have received your letter calling my attention to the dangers to the public service, arising "from the condition and management of our railroads," and asking my assistance in endeavoring t facilitate transportation and to prevent dangerous and injurious delays. I was made painfully aware of the delays of which you so justly complain during the recent attack upon Wilmington, and I assure you that you shall have my hearty co-operation in producing such reforms as can be effected on the North Carolina roads. I have no control whatever over the Piedmont road.

With sentiments of great respect, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.
