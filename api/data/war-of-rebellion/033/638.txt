parties. This will probably be the tactics of the rest. I think there are troops enough north of the Osage, and that your force will do best to remain some distance south of the river, with scouts or advance parties at all the crossings, to give timely information. Look out well to the west. I suspect Shelby will try to escape that way. Advise me often of your movements, so that I may send you information. I have not yet learned in what direction Coffee was running.

Major-General.

EIGHT MILES NORTH OF BOONVILLE,

October 12, 1863-7 a.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

If the enemy has crossed the river, send a steamboat to Boonville immediately. I am out of subsistence. If the enemy turns south, send fifteen thousand rations on road as far as west as possible.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 12, 1863

Major R. H. BROWN, California, Mo.:

The rebels started in retreat from Boonville at 7.30 o'clock this morning. General Brown in hot pursuit. Send out and ascertain, if possible, the direction of their movement. Send this also to commander on train or at Tipton. Keep your command well in hand, and hold them in check if they pass near you until the pursuing force can come up. How many troops have you?

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 12, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Morton reports from Linn Creek, dated yesterday. Command 800 independent of local garrison (two companies of militia). He has sent four companies to Tuscumbia. This was unnecessary, as I have there a battalion of the First Nebraska. I propose, with your approbation, to send Morton up the Osage; his infantry 150 strong, to Duroc, a favorite ford of rebels, about 72 miles below Warsaw, two companies of his cavalry to Warsaw; Morton, with four companies, at Osceola; the rest of his cavalry west of him, watching the fords of the Osage. I await your orders. The two companies of militia at Linn Creek can take care of the fords at that place and Mining Post.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 12, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Cole did not get off from Tipton until 8 o'clock this morning. Railroad all right to Syracuse, and reported so to La Mine River, at Tipton. Says Brown is fighting, at Boonville, rebels under Coffee.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.
