I have been busy all day directing and examining, and the meeting escaped my memory. My non-attendance was known to you. I cannot think I could be supposed to have received any instructions in regard to the movement to-morrow.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

COLONEL: The advance of my division had crossed the Rapidan at Ely's Ford before I received the order countermanding a movement for to-day. There were 7 cavalrymen on picket on the other side. Only one regiment of mine was seen by the enemy. I now have one brigade at Richardsville and one near Ellis' Ford. I have sent my wagon train to Brandy Station to load with forage. A party of 30 rebel cavalry was at Richardsville this morning. My headquarters near Ellis' Ford.

Yours, &amp;c.,
