There are in this department, including those with General Meade, about 20, 000 militia and emergency men, organized and equipped. Shall more militia regiments be raised?

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 14, 1863-9 p. m.

Major-General COUCH,Chambersburg:

The enemy evacuated last night the very strong position he occupied yesterday. I was only able to overtake his rear guard at Falling Waters, where we captured over 2, 000 prisoners, several guns, standards, &amp;c. The rest of the army had crossed during the night. I am about moving down the river to cross at Berlin, and move down the Loudoun Valley. I wish to take every available man with me now with my army. At the same time I think Hagerstown ought to be occupied and the river watched, till we know what has become of Lee. If you can do this with the forces under your command, you will render me an essential service. I have directed General Smith to report to you for instructions, as the time of his men is so nearly out. Please let me know by telegram whether you can comply with my wishes.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Since my dispatch of this morning, I learn from prisoners captured that Longstreet with his corps is within supporting distance of Williamsport. I therefore defer my proposed advance against that place, but will operate against the enemy on his other flank.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
