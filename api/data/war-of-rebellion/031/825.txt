At Cumberland, Md., one battery and 1,600 infantry. Two regiments between New Creek and Ohio River, guarding railroad. Between Cumberland and Hancock, in General Morell's division, there is one regiment of cavalry and one of infantry guarding railroad. At least one regiment should be left at New Creek and one at Cumberland, to guard railroad and stores, in case troops are ordered to move east.
