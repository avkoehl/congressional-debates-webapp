the passengers, he asks them to assist m getting his locomanve
an,d tender on to the tails again and the passenger caid, too,
they ask No, gentlemen, I intend to leave you where you
are I have constitutional scruples What would probably be
the answer of the passengers? He would not apply their an
sweras his answer Before be gave a final answer, he would
ask the chief engineer, Pray, sir, if we do put you on the rails,
how do you propose to proceed' He has aheady answered
Try another experiment, merely by changing my flmtre
wheels to the othei side The unanimous opinion of the pas
songers would be, that at the next turn he would bo oft and
in the ditch on the other side, and entertaining that opinion, he
would not, as one of the passengers, vote lor any measure of
relief to the Government that was unsafe for the people
SPEECH OF MR. WISE,
Of Virginia,
In the House of Representatives, Octobei 13   1837—On the
bill from the Senate to create a Sub Ticasuiy system
Mr WISE said After the nch treat wluci wh have justen

session reviewed the last Message of the 'Gteatest and Best,"
and did I not feel it to be a more nnpoiattve duty to ieview
the fiitot Message of his piotegeand succetsoi, I would not mo
teed a' all But ¡sir, a duty rests up n my shoulders which
most gentlemen seem to shun and I shall dteehaigeit, though
the debate has exhausted tins subject and exhauste t still
more out time and out patience ] mean the duty ol complain

The gentleman fiom South Caiolma (Mi Legate) exhorted
us not to disturb our tempeiaby tianng the cause oí the ills
we endure to their authois—it could lead to nothing but cnmi
nation and rei animation, hebegijed us rather to study out the
remedy and to apply it to our maladies 1 shall not follow the

In the Piesident's Message of December, 1833, he (Tackson)
told us  "I entirely concur m the view he' (theSecietan of the
Tieasury) " has taken of the subject," (the removal of the de
posnes )   What was the view he toolti   The report of the Se
cretaiy of the Treasuiy (Mr Taney) in 18 3, «ays
"The State banks' can, I have no doubt furnish a geneial
circulating medium, quite asunifoim in value as that which
has been affoided by the Bank of the Un ted States Piobably
moie so " " * "But a currency founded on the notes of
State hanks could not be suddenly substituted for that heielo
fore furnished bz the Bank of the United Stites and take the
place of it, at the samp moment, in every pait of the Union It
is essential that the change should he giadud, and sufficient
time should be allowed to suffer it to make its way by the ordi
nary opeiations of commerce, without requiring a hasty and
violent effort "
This v  w was suppoited by the Committee of Wa>3 and
Means m the House of Repre-.ntatives, the chau man (hen (Mi
Polk) the present Speaker The repoit of that committee in
1833-'34 upon the lemoval of the deposites, says
"The question then ames whether the State banks should be
conti iufd as the fiscal agents of the Cover ment The com
in it tee are satisfied tint the State bonks are fully competent to
peifotm all the services which the General Government ought
to íequiie, m the collet tion anl disbuisement of the revenue,
and to afford all the facilities to the internal t ommcrce and t\
changes of the count) y which have been duned from the flank
of the United Slates
"The opinion has dready been expiessed that tin St i e bank 
aie competent to perform all the duties which the Government
or the public conveniente may require and there are many
encutvenames which stiongly lecommend them toa piefeience

"Tht Sute banks lie now fiimly inteiwoven with the insti

the spirit of our institutions fm Congieps to sustain igieitmo

Bv ti e i -p of the State hini s it is a«certamed that the mo evs
of the TTnited States can be collected an I disbursed without
loss onnconvenience, and that all the wants of the community,
in relation to exchange and currency, are supplied as welt as-
they ever have been before If, under cucumistances the most
unfavorable to the steadiness of the money market, it has bafrt
found thrtt the considerations on which the Bank of the United
States rested its claims to the public favor were imaginary and
groundless, it eannot bo doubted that the experience of the fit
ture will be moiedecisiveagainstihem It hasbeenseen th,*t,
without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly, the re* enue
can be collected, and conveniently and safely applied to «ill the
purposes of the public expenditure It is also ascert lined that,
instead of being neces anly made to promote the evils of an un
checked paper system, the management of the revenue can be
made auxihaiy to the reform which the Legislatures of several
of the Stales have already commenced m regard to the sup,p£e&v
sion of small bills, and winch has only to he fostered by propep
regulations, &n the part of Congress, to «ecure a practical rt*.
turn, to the extent required for the secmity of the currency, to
the constitutional medium Seveied fiom the Government as
po meal engines, and not sm>copuble of dangerous extension
and combination, the State banks will not be tempted, not will
they have the power which we have seen exercised, todiveit
the public funds from the legitimate purposes of the Govern*
ment The collection and custody of the revenue being, on the*
contrary, a source ofneht to them, will increase the secuiity:
which the States provide fot a faithful execution, of their trusts,.
by multiplying the scrutinies io which their vperatious andae
counts will be subjected Thud disposed as well riom inteiest
as the obligations of their chaiters it cannot be doubted that
stun conditions as Congress may see lit to adopt it&perting the
deposites in these institutions, with a view to the giadua1 disuse
of the small bills, will be cheerfully complied with, and wes>on
shall gam, mplai e of the Bank ofih- United States, a piactical
leform in the whole paper sy& cm of the country If, by this
policy, we can nltimatt ly witness th" suppression of all bank
bills below twenty dolíais, it is apparent thaf gold and silver
will take their place, and become the principal ciiudatinsr me-,
dium in the common busine s of the farmers an! mechmics-
of the coun i y 1 he attainment of such a result will form an
era in the history ©f our coun íy, which will be dwelt upon,
with delight by every true friend of its liberty and indepen-
dence It will lighten the gieat tax which our paper system
has so long collected from the earnings of labor, and do moie to
revive md perpetuate those habits of economy and simphcitv
which aie so congenial to the ihaiacterof Republicans, than
all the legislation which has yet been attempted '
Mi Secietary Woodbury's leport, of thei-ame date tells us
"This Department takes pleasure in statme that the public
money continues tobe collected and deposited, undei the fie
spiiI system of selected banks, with great ease and economy m
all cases, an I with greater in some than at any former penod
The ttan^fers of it to evmy quarter of the countiy whire it is
needed for di buisement have net ei been effected with moro
p omptitude and have been entirely rep ot expense to the
Tieaamy The paym nts to i reditois, officers, and pensionéis-,
have been punctual and convenient, and the whole fiscal ope-,
rations thioiiffh the State banks have as yet,proved highly sa
tiMfactory Incidental to this the facilities that have been fur
mshed to the commercial community in domestic exchanges,,
were probably nevei greater, or at so moderate rates "
A cam, he says
" It will be seen that the situaiion of the selected banks as a
whole, bears an enviable comparison with the re°t In all
cases deemed propei,they have given collateral secunty, and
are all believed to be entuely safe, to the extent they have
b( en confided in Their discounts Inve been in general some
wh it mcreised, but, though tempted by the emu prising spirit
of the times,not ustia'ly increased in a degrte dispropoitinned
to all iheir available means They have also in some ca-^c^

tions m their nei boot hood bv aslai^eand long halluces and
other m Itdpt ncits as would gmeially ap|eai to have been
panctiomd by correct principles "
Now, -fir '■'■the enteipusinz spirit of the times'is caled
by the bard name of ' improvident speculation'—"oué/^
fiction "
In "the last annual menace,' Decembci, 183G, the Greatest
and Best still continued to say
"Experience continues to leahze tin expeitafcrons entertain
ed as to the capacity of the State banks io peiform t! e duties
of fiscal asrents or the Government at the-time if the removal*
of the deposites it was alleged by th- advocates of the Innk
