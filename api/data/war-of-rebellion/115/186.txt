LOUISEVILLE, KY., January 6, 1862.

Colonel CHARLES WHITTLESEY,

Commanding Twentieth Ohio Volunteers.

SIR: I am directed by the general commanding to instruct you that in future you will make no more arrests of civilians except such as may be engaged in violent proceedings against the Government.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OLIVER D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, January 8, 1862.

U. S. MARSHAL, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, U. S. PASSPORT AGENT, COLLECTOR AND OTHER OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES AT PORTLAND, ME.

The authorities of the United States will permit the British steamer and the officers or agents of the British Government to have all proper facilities for landing and transporting to Canada or elsewhere troops, stores and munitions of war of every kind without exception or reservation.

WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, January 10, 1862.

Hon. GIDEON WELLES, Secretary of the Navy.

SIR: The Secretary of the Interior has referred to this Department a letter addressed to him by the U. S. marshal at Key West asking what disposition shall be made of prisoners brought thither by naval officers and committed to his custody. He represents that there are no proper accommodations there for them and suggests that they be taken to New York by the steamer Connecticut or Rhode Island. I will consequently suggest an order to this effect, and that on their arrival at New York the prisoners be delivered to the marshal of the United States there for confinement in Fort Lafayette.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

LOUISVILLE, KY., January 10, 1862.

It must be done only upon good evidence and will discrimination and must be immediately reported to headquarters. ***

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
