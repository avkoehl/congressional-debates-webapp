obeyed me cheerfully and pushed in. Not being willing to leave the repulse of the enemy a matter of doubt, or to expose the brave fellows to the danger of heavy loss, I ordered up two of Cruft's regiments, and upon approaching the edge of the woods halted them-told them it was my purpose to clear the woods at the point of the bayonet. To inspire them with coolness and confidence, the preparations for the charge were made with great deliberation. To get the proper direction for the line, guides were thrown out and the proper changes were made, bayonets fixed, and these two regiments, Thirty-first Indiana and Ninetieth Ohio, ordered to clear the woods. They went in splendidly. It was done so quickly that the rebels had hardly time to discharge their pieces. They fled with the utmost speed. All these regiments behaved handsomely.

With this report will be forwarded a list of the casualties of my command, and from its fearful proportions demonstrates its had service.
