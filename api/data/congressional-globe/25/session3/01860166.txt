ARMY BILL
The House then resumed the consideration of
the Aimy service bill for 1839
The question pending was the amendment
moved yesterday by Mr Mercer, " foi the pros
ecution of suiveys under the act of the 30th of
Apnl, 1834, «30,000 "
Mr CAMBRELENG moved the following
substitute, " for arrearages of suiveys under the
act of 30th of Apnl, 1824,$4,000,"and p-oduced
a letter from Colonel Abert, chief of the topo-
graphical bureau, showing the latter sum to bt all
that was lequned at present under that act
Mr MERCER opposed the amendment as not
providing foi a further execution of the law, a
law which was still in foi ce Mi M produced
a letter fiom the Secretary of War, recommend-
ing the largei sum Mr M insisted that it was
the duty of the Committee of Ways and Means
to provide foi canying out that law
Mi BLLL complained ot this mode of shifting
responsibility from the Executive shouldeis, by
these private estimates sent in from time to time,
without, in many instances, the slightest pnvity
on the part of the House, and by which membeis
of that House were often held alone responsible
foi appropnations which had been recommended
by the Executive
Mr CAMBRELENG, remaikmg that a bill
having been repoited this morning providing
$10,000 for the cairying on and completing of
militaiy surveys, witrdiew his amendment
Mr HOLSEY made a geneial reply to the po-
sitions assumed by Mr  MiRcERandMr  Bell
Mr PICKENS contended that the act of 1824
only authonzed an appiopnation of «30,000 for
that one year, and not, as Mr Mercer insisted,
from yeai to year Mr P was opposed to the
continuance of the appropnation on constitutional
giounds, because, though if confined to military
suiveys only, they would come within the pale
of the Constitution, but it was notorious that
these suiveys, as they had foi yeais been earned
on, foimed the bases upon which the internal lm
provement sjstem was eonstiucted The amount
of «30,000 was but a tnfle, yet he looked to the
enormous expenditure involved in, and brought
about by, these surveys
>. Mr GARLAND, of Virginia, also opposed
the amendment of Mr Mercer, and regarded it
as both unconstitutional and inexpedient Mr
G then went into a general aigument against the
proposition, as pioductive of woiks of internal
improvement, and involving immense appropri-
ations, often for improvements which, but for
these suiveys, would neverhave been thought of.
Mr G had heaid much about economy and re-
form, and he asked when and wheie were they
to begin > Where could there be a moie fit and
suitable occasion than on these suiveys cspe
cially, too, when the Tie isury was empty? If
these new surveys were authorized, gentlemen
would be asking foi harbois, clearing nveis and
creeks, constiuctmg light houses, &c , and as so
much had been said for some time past on the
necessity of economy, heie was the place to test
the sincerity of men of all parties, because the
inteiest of almost all were involved Toi him-
self, Mi G- had always opposed these propo-
sitions as unconstitutional
Mr EVANS advocated the amendment as
complying with the provisions of an existing
law
Mr MASON, of Ohio, contended that if the
House lejected this amendment, the advocates of
strict construction would not attain their object,
for the surveys, if not made under the law of
1824, would be made in some other way, and as
much money would be indirectly appropriated as
if the matter were openly and avowedly voted for
He denied that the great principle adverted to by
Mr Pickens and Mr Garland was involved in
this proposition, though, if it was, he should vote
for it, though he was not in favor of an extrav-
agant scheme of internal improvements He eu-
logized the law of 1824 as having given birth to
many a splendid woik in the States, that, but for
it, would never, perhaps, have been constructed
Mr TAYLOR said, Decause appropnations
had been made in consequence of the act of 1824,
he did not deem it obligatory upon Congiess to
continue them, for he denietl that that act was
prospective in its opeiation, but was limited to
the yeai of its passage, and he, for one, was not
disposed to continue them Moreover, the prop-
osition was of too general and indefinite a char-
acter, and should notbe adopted unless the House
knew what specific surveys were to be made, so
that they might judge of their nationality He
was willing to go for a suivey of this chatacter,
but for nothing more
Mr HO WARD remarked that the gentleman's
own mle should induce him to vote for this ap-
propriation, for, although it was true that the sum
of «30,000 was asked for m gross, yet the com-
munication of the Secretary of War had specified
the surveys proposed to be made for the coming
year
After some remarks from Messrs GARLAND
and CRAIG, in opposition, and Mr CARTER,
in favor of the amendment, Mr PETRIKIN
obtained the floor, and moved the previous ques-
tion, which the House, by tellers refused to sec-
ond, there being 65 for, and 67 against it
Mr CAMBRELENG expressed the hope that
if gentlemen were determined to have this appro-
priation, it would be done in a separate bill, and
made specific He said the law of 1824, which
this amendment m effect goes to revive, places in
the hands of the President a power which he
wished not to see given again to any person, that
it gave him absolute power to go through every
State of the Union, to make what surveys he
pleased He hoped that there was no pai ty in this
House disposed to do the like act, and if it were
necessary to appropriate this amount to surveys,
that there were other bills in which this amend-
ment might, with more propriety, be inserted
He appealed to the House, therefore, not to ap-
pend it to the Army bill, but to appropriate it by
specific law, and place it upon its own merits
Mr ROBINSON was understood to be op-
posed to the amendment on the ground that it
would revive the act of 1824 He was opposed
to the whole system of internal improvements,
and contended that it was a war upon the Con-
stitution
Before taking any question,
On motion of Mr MURRAY, the House ad-
journed
