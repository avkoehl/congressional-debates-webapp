Major-General WARREN,

Commanding:

GENERAL: It will be very difficult to destroy the railroad, at least the rails. These are connected in such a way that tools will be required. The connection of the rails is such that in turning over the entire tracks and sleepers does not break it. My command has turned over about a mile of the road. Our pickets are about a mile from Jarratt's Station. A very few of the enemy seen in that direction. My horses need water very much, which I will try to find.

Yours, &c.,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Cavalry.

He thinks there were about 500 men there. At Belfield this morning they knew of our having been at Sussex last night and have been sending property away to-day.

Yours, respectfully,

D. MCM. GREGG,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding Cavalry.
