of White River transportation for 5,000 troops. He has ordered the divisions of Smith and Mower, now operating in Missouri, to proceed to Memphis by the shortest route. If they have gone too far in pursuit of Price to be recalled by the Missouri River, they will move by Fort Smith and Devall's Bluff to their destination. When you come into General Steele's department the senior officer will assume the control. General Dennis has been ordered to send a brigade at once to Devall's Bluff, to report its arrival by telegram to General Steele, to send Shaler's brigade so soon as it arrives to Devall's Bluff, and to follow with the remainder of his division. The general's present idea is that the enemy may attempt to break through the line of the Arkansas.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
