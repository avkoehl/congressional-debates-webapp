rear, and advanced as far as my skirmish line, when they opened fire, to which the enemy immediately replied. Rapid firing was kept up on both sides until nearly dark, when the enemy gave way, and their line of works fell into our hands. Several of the enemy's sharpshooters were shot out of tree-tops by some of the regiment. The balance of the regiment were in the charge made by the brigade, but did not suffer as much as those on picket. The loss was 1 man killed and 7 wounded. We were relieved from picket about noon on the 2nd, and rejoined the brigade. We laid on arms all night behind breast-works, protected from the fire of the enemy, which was kept up all the afternoon and most of the night, having 2 men wounded. On the morning of the 3rd an assault was ordered to be made by the Sixth Corps upon the enemy's works. The One hundred and tenth Regiment formed the front line on the right of the brigade, supported on its left by the One hundred and twenty-second Ohio, and connecting on its right with the left of the Second Division. I was directed to keep connection on my right with the left of the Second Division. After advancing about 100 yards, the whole line was halted. I then received orders from Colonel Smith, commanding brigade, to advance my line. I advanced it about 75 yards, the One hundred and twenty-second advancing with me. The Second Division having failed to advance, the right of my line became very much exposed. Finding a farther advance would be hazardous, I gave the order to halt. We remained for about two hours, exposed to a severe cross-fire from musketry and artillery, when we received orders to fall back on a line with the Second Division. We remained exposed to the fire of the enemy from behind their earth-works (about 150 yards distant), which proved so destructive that it became necessary to protect ourselves in some way. The men commenced making excavations, by digging with their bayonets and scooping up the earth with their tin cups and plates. After a short time they succeeded in getting a few shovels, with which they went vigorously to work-the enemy continuing their fire, occasionally killing and wounding one. In a short time they had a line of logs and earth thrown up sufficient for them to lie behind and return the enemy's fire with comparative safety. We occupied this position during the day and until 10 o'clock at night, when we were relieved, and occupied the fourth line of works. During the operations of the day, we had 1 commissioned officer wounded, 4 enlisted men killed, and 34 wounded. The lines had to be relieved in the night, to avoid being seen by the enemy. Every man who passed to the rear line, did so at the risk of his life. We continued to occupy the different lines of works, alternating with other regiments of the brigade, until the night of the 10th, when with the balance of the division we moved to the left to relieve the Second Division, Second Corps. The movement was delayed too long, and daylight came before it could be made, and was consequently postponed until afternoon, when it was accomplished without molestation. We remained in the position during the night and next day, firing at every head that appeared above the works, and having our own fired at in return.*
