entitled "An act to incorporate the Lincoln
Monument Association," approved March 3,
1867, damaged and captured guns and ord-

principle figures surmounting, and to be incor-
porated in said structure ; provided that no
metal as aforesaid shall be thus appropriated
until the voluntary contributions for said pur-
pose, actually in the hands of the treasurer,
shall amount to 5100,000.
There being no objection the bill was con-
sidered.
Mr. VAN HORN, of New York. I have no
desire to take the time of the House unless
some one desires an explanation. It will be
recollected during last Congress we incorpo-
rated what is called the Lincoln Monument
Association. That association has proceeded
in its work, and they only ask now that there
bo placed at their disposal broken cannon
captured from the enemy to make the princi-
pal figures on the monument, when there shall
be $100,000 of voluntary contributions in their
treasury. There are plenty of these broken
cannon on hand, and I think there will be no
objection to the resolution.
Mr. BUTLER. With the consent of the
gentleman from New York. [Mr. Van Horn,]
I move to amend by adding after "1867" the
words, and all other associations of a similar
character."
Mr. VAN HORN. I will allow the amend-
ment. I demand the previous question.
Ihe previous question was seconded and the
mam question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the amendment was agreed to.

nays.

ing the yeas and nays.

by winch the amendment of the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Butler] was agreed to.
