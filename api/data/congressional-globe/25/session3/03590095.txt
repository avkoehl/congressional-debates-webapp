safely in the Treasury, but in some way used for
the benefit of trade, foi the good of the commu-
n ty, for individual accommodation. We deny
it The great patties of the country are m hos-
tility upon this point We hold the practice and
the policy to be radically wrong, essentially coi-
rupt We hold the public money to becoxsE
crated by THE CONSTITUTION, and by every
sound principle of pMte policy to fiblic, ccnsii-
iu^ional uses 0">íly The reverse is maintained
by the Opposition The conttary practice and
policy which we condemn, are advocated and vin-
dicated by them, and because we diffei with them,
they denounce us a'? the enemies of commerce and
trade, and the subverteis of the credit system
Now, sir, I ask, is it not an obvious and neces-
sary consequence, of this principle which has been
sanctioned of using the public money for private
purposes, of these defects m our legislat'on which
1 have pointed out as having their soui ce in this
pnnciple, and of this favorite policy of the Op-
position  so  strongly advocated and so zealously
maintained, that the public officer should persuade
himself, deceive himself, if you pleasp, into the
belief, that this use of the public money foi private
puiposes, upon the whoie, is a very good thing >
that, after all, it is right enough, at least, if he
only promptly settle his account when called upon
to do so? and that the same thing cannot very well
be commendable in one set of public agents, and
deserve the penitentiary in another'   It is not in
the nature of man to make fine spun distinctions
against himself, aga nst his own interests—*o con
demn and disgrace himself in his own judgment
foi what others are deemed benefaetois     Í appeal
to  the experience, the observation, of all  who '
hear me, whether men who would shudder at |
crime and dishonor do not peisuade themselves
that they may use the pub! c money, and when
they have done so, and some unexpected reverse,
the unfortunate issue of some flattering specula
tion, involves them in difficulty and in mm, and i
forces them into the attitude of defaulters towards I
this Government, are they not ready for any sac
rifice to redeem themselves and maintain a charac-
ter for integrity m the  community where they
iive>   Sir, it is the vice of your system, they are
the victims of your  legislation     in  almost all
cases they owe their fall  to the false pnnciple
which you have introduced and sanctioned     We i
have endeavored to cut it up by the roots—to ex-
pel it altogether     We have waged war against it  I,
We will never make an end of the war till there
is an end of the principle     We would mteidict
the application of the public   money to  private
uses      We   would bring the oath of the public
officer to the aid of law      We wou'd uenounce it
as an infamous offense, and  bring the terrors of
the penitentiary to bear upon it     We would bring
the honesty and the honor of every public officer,
at the very outset, in the most unequivocal man-
ner, to confront and arrest him before the first false
step     We would institute the most ngorous and |
frequent examinations, that there may be no hope
to escape detection, no false, flatten ig anticipa
tion of impunity     We would supeiadd all the se-
curity to be derived from the most ample offiual
bonds    This is what we would do     This is what
we have attempted to do      But what has been the
couise of the Opposition '   They have resisted us
every step, heie and elsewhere. They have met us
at every point    They have struggled to maintain
and perpetuate the old, corrupt, defective, broken |
down, unconstitutional systems   They have clung
to the bank and State connection     They have
resisted all reform    They have labored to defeat
the new guards and securities, which we attempted
to throw round the public moneys in times of great
difficulty and embarrassment, when the wholepub-
hc treasure, by the operation of laws which they
assisted to enact, was thrown, suddenly, hy a con-
vulsion, into the hands of public officers     They
have refused any law     They have refused to pro- |
pose any measure of their own, or to modify any I
measuie proposed by us, and twice, when we have I
offered them a law, recommended, by the Execu- I
live, and passed by the Senate, designed to reform
existing ev Is, and to surround the public moneys
with new gua-ds and secunties, demanded by the
exigencies of the times, they have promptly laid it I
upon the table; and these defeetam our legislation,
which are the causes of almost all the defalcations
that have occurred, a>-e still permitted to exist,
and to swallow up yeaily thousands and tens of
thousands of the public money                                  ,
I hope, su, the House will come to the vote    I
am anxious, whatever the result may be, that the
vote be taken     I wibh to probe these defaults to I
the bottom     I know of no one who opposes in- ¡
vestigation      Bu* I am not willing that, contraiy
to the usage of this and of all other legislative
bodies organized as this is, the power of appoint
ment should  be taken from the proper organ of
the Flouse, and committed to the fuends of the
individual who^e misconduct is to be examined
If it be done, let it be done open'y, not by seciet
ballot    I wish to know, and the country will
wish to know, who is responsible for what is
done    But whatever couise shall be taken, our
purposes will be defeated, unless we take it quick- '
ly     Let  the investigation go on, let the facts be
examined thoroughly, let them be presented fully, |
if for no other purpose, at least to enlighten us in
the discharge of our legislative duty, and let no
obstacle bethiown in the way                                    '
rUBLIC LANDS
REMARKS OF HON J. C. CALHOUN,
or  SOUTH CAROLINA,
In Scnate, January 15, 1839,
On the engiossment of the bill for graduating the
puce of Public Lands
Mr C YLHOTJN said   I have no desire, Mi
Piesident, to  retaid, in the smallest degree, the
final action of the Senate on thi^ bi'l, and in older
to avoid unnecessiiy consumption of time, 1 m
tend to state, as concisely as possible, my views
of tne proper policy to be puisued in ¡eference to
the public lands lying within the limits of thenew
States, and my íeasons for voting against the en
gros3ment of this bill
I shall begin with premising that I am under
strong conviction, both from observation and re
flection, that we have arrived at the period when
an entire revolution of our land system, as far as
it is applicable to those States, is unavoidable
They have, in fact, outgrown the system Since
its first adoption, they have come into existence,
have passed through a state of infancy, and have
now amvedat mar hood The system wnithwas
wise and just at first, is neither wise nor just, ap
plied to them in their changed condition
We have heaid much, Mr President, in the
present discussion, ebouf tne giowth of the new
States, but, if 1 may ,udgefiom the various meas-
ures propose! on the present occasion, we have
neither realized its rapidity, nor the unavoidable
changes in our land system whicn must follow in
its tiam I heir wonderful growth is, indeed, one
of those realities almost beyond the grasp ot lm
agination When I go back twenty seven vears,
to the period when I fi st became a membei of the
other House, and compaie what the new Sta'es
then were to what the/now are, Í am lost in won
der and amazement Their growth is without
example Theie is nothing like it in history At
that time theie was but a single newState,(Ohio )
Í exclude Kentucky, Tennessee, and Maine, all
of which have been admitted since the adoption of
the Constitution, and limit my remaiks to those
which have since sprung up on the public domain
Ohio had then but one Representative in the
other House, Jeremiah Morrow, an honest and
sensible man, who wasa' Jiattimeat the head of the
Committee on the Public Lands, and had the con
fidence of the House so completely that his voice
was the law on all subjects connected with them,
■so little interest did they, at that time, excite
There weie then thirty two Senators in all, of
which Ohio had, of course, two, that is, the one
sixteenth of the whole In the electoral college
she had three votes, which made her right about
the one fiftieth in that body—a weight scarcely
ttlt or estimated in the political movements of the
day
Such, at that time was the infant and feeble
condition of the new States Since then, in ape
nod but little exceeding that allotted to a single :
generation to pass over the stage of life, how won-
derful the change ' Instead oí one,as then, there
are now nine new States, and in the place of two ,
Senators in thirty-two, we now have eighteen in
fifty-two, making, instead of one sixteenth, more
than a third of the whole, and already three Ter-
utones, Florida, Wisconsin, and Iowa,aiestrug-
glmg for admission When admitted, which must
be shortly, theie will then be twelve new States,
with twenty four Senators in fifty six, which will
mci ease their relative weight in tins body to three
sevenths of the wh le
But as wonderful as has been the increase in
this body, it will be still more so, after the next
census, m the other It will be taken next year,
and a new apportionment of the members will be
made under the Constitution, when, instead of a
single member, being less than one in a hundred,
as was the case twentv-seven years ago, the repre-
sentation of the new States will then stand to the
I old, at least, os forty to sixty, or two fifths of
the whole, as calculated by a friend familiar with
the subject, and m who=e accuracy I have entire
I confidence The new States having, as they will
then, three sevenths in tms, and two fifths m the
other House, will, of course, havea relative weight
in the electoral college, or the same thing in a choice
of a President, compounded of the two, that is,
five twelfths of the whoie  So much for the past
Now, if we turn to the future, we shall find the
cause of this amazing growth so far from being
exhausted or weakened, ¡s acting with increased
force, and urging forward the growth of those
States with accelerated, instead of a decreasing,
velocity, so much so, that the past changes in the
last twenty seven years will appear as nothing
compared with what will take place in the next
twenty seven, unless some unforeseen occurrence
snould intervene to retard their progress If my
memory serves me, our population, twenty seven
years ago, was about sever millions, and our an-
nual mciease then, that is, the excess of births
over deaths, including emigration, about two hun-
dí ed thousand, estimating oui giowth at three per-
cent compound Since then, our population has
increased not les" than nine millions, making the
present probably about sixteen, which, on the
same data, wul make our annual increase at this
time but little short of half a million, the greater
part of which will find their homes in the new
States
I wul not enter into a minute calculation as to
the effects of this gieat increase on the relative
weight of the new and old States at the next suc-
ceeding census, m 1850 It is sufficient to say,
that it will give a decided majority to the former,
both in the House of Representatives and in the
electoial college, and of course, in the Government,
and thus, in the shoit space of one generation and
a half, the center of political power, as between
the old and new States, will have passed from the
former to the latter
Now, with these unquestionable results before
us, I ask,not whethei ltvvould be wise to continue
the old system, no, sir' a far bolder question—ivdl
it be practicable1} And if not practicable, would ü
be wise to struggle io continue it till overthrown by
thcfoice of unavoidable and irt esisíüU causes ? I ask,
what would be the effects of such a struggle'
Would it not be to excite, in the first instance,
anmosity and discord between the old and new-
States, and, in the end, to overthrow the entire
land system, with the certain loss, uitimately, of
the public domain' I shall not, on this occasion,
attempt a foi mal discussion of these points I
piopose, in order to illustrate, simply to show
how vain and dangerous would be the attempt to
hold on to the present system, under these great
and "Towinr changes by tracing its operation
under a single aspect, its bearing on the presiden-
tial question
To have a clear conception of this, we must
bear in mmd that aftei the next census the new
bti-te? will have live twelfths of the electoral col-
lege, and, of course, compaied to either oe the
o'her sect ons, a controlling voice m the election
of a President He who keeps this m mind, ard
understands the workmss of the human heart and
of our system, mu"t see that in the presidential
contest, Toi such it must ever be,) the great point,
hereafter, wiil be to secure their favor, and that
