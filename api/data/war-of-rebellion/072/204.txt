the last hundred days with ability and constancy, and to them I tender my warmest thanks. All under their command I must leave without special notice, from the fact that otherwise the list would be too extended.

For gallantry, efficiently, unflinching activity, and gentlemanly department I commend the different members of my staff, viz: Colonel F. T. Sherman, chief of staff (captured while reconnoitering, July 7); Lieutenant Colonel J. S. Fullerton, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Colonel H. Hayes, chief quartermaster; Lieutenant Colonel D. Remick, chief commissary of subsistence; Surg. J. Theo. Heard, medical director; Captain E. P. Pearson, Seventeenth U. S. Infantry, commissary of musters; Captain Henry Kaldenbaugh, provost-marshal; Captain Joseph A. Schoeninger, staff quartermaster; Captain H. M. Stinson, aide-de-camp (seriously wounded through the lungs, May 27); Captain F. W. Gilbreth, aide-de-camp; Captain E. H. Kirlin, volunteer aide-de-camp; Captain Lyman Bridges, chief of artillery.

Major Francis Mohrahardt is highly recommended for his carefulness in mapping the country passed over by the troops.*

It may not be inappropriate, now that I am separated from your army, to express my appreciation of the uniform confidence reposed in me by the commanding general, and to acknowledge that I owe any success or reputation I may have gained while in command of the Fourth Corps, in a great measure to himself.

Herewith please find a list of casualties, also of recommendations for promotion.
