SIR: I have just received intelligence from my infantry who left Huttonsville yesterday is a southern direction, and will return to-morrow or next day. No organization has yet been discovered. They have orders similar to those from you, ordering me to send cavalry. Shall I send the cavalry also?

BALTIMORE, April 12, 1865.,

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In view of the peculiar state in this department, and particularly in the city of Baltimore, and the disposition of the people who still insist upon being disloyal, I propose to issue an order that all rebel officers and soldiers who were paroled by Lee's surrender who come to this department to remain until exchanged must report to the nearest provost-marshal and have their names registered, and require them to abandon the rebel uniform while here. Unless some such order is issued the streets will be filled with rebel uniforms, and women parading with rebel uniforms, and women parading with them, and the result will be truble. Will such an order conflict with the terms of their parole or be approved by you?

W. W. MORRIS,

Brigadier-General.
