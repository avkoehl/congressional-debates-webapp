the first to arraign him, and would be wanting m
his duty if he did not Mr C insisted that the
Secretary had given every particle of information
he was required to do, and had included every
fund he had a right to draw upon
Mr. BELL still thought there was a law requir-
ing the investment of the trust fund, but if not, there
should be, and the fault was m Congress
Mr. HALSTEAD moved that the committee
rise lost—88 to 93.
Mr ROBERTSON said he understood the amend-
ment offered by his colleague had been decided to
be out of order, and that the discussion reverted to
the original bill. He would offer an amendment
confined to the first clause of his colleague's amendg
ment, which, he understood, was decided to be in
order, and he assented to the decision that the other
clause was not. He objected to this indirect mode
of raising money, and thought it would have been
better for the chairman of the Commi'lee of
Ways and Means to have come forward fan ly
and candidly, and to hav e slated that t ie
Government wanted money, and must have it
He was willing they should have it, so fai as it de-
pended upon his vote, but not in the way they
wanted it He would assent to a loan, or, if thsic
was no other way to raise money, he would resort
to direct taxation, and let the people feel the condi-
tion of the country. But he thought there were
other means to obtain necessary funds, and he
■would resort to them in preference to the bill now
under consideration
Mr. R then offered an amendment, m substance
the same as the first clause of the amendment of
Mr. Hopkins, as given above
Mr. MASON of Virginia, at half past six
o'clock, took the floor, and said it must be obvious
that they could not gel through this bill to-ni°-ht,
and give it that mature deliberation its importance
merited, and he therefore moved that tin commit-
tee rise
The question was taken by tellers, and lost—63
to 86
Mr. MASON opposed the original bill, and after
proceeding for some time, gave way to
Mr. MENEFEE, who moved that the committee
rise lost—60 to 84.
Mr. MASON again proceeded, and at half past
7, yielded the floor to
Mr HOPKINS, who renewed the motion for
the committee to rise, but they again lefused—ayes
79, noes 89. '
Mr. MASON again proceeded till 8 o'clock,
when he gave way to
Mr, LEG ARE, who made an earnest appeal to
the committee, and moved that it rise, report, and
ask leave to sit again. He remaiked that they had
teen in continuous session for nine hours, and were
all more or less considerably fatigued, and as he
himself should probably be found in the majority
on the bill, he did  hope the motion would pievail
The committee, however, refused to rise, the vote,
taken by the tellers, being ayes 80, noes 88
Mr. MASON resumed, and avowed himself in
favor of the special deposite system for the safe-
keeping of the public moneys, and notified the
House that, m due time, he should submit a piojet
to that effect. With reference to the measure undei
debate, he avowed himself willing to go for such
a limited issue of Treasury notes as would meet the
present exigencies of the Treasury, and when they
were exhausted, meet the further wants of the Go-
vernment bj a direct loan He could not, theie-
fore, vote foi the proposition of his colleague [Mr.
Robertson] unless it wis modified
Mr. STEWART moved an additional section to
the amendment of Mi. ROBERTSON, as follows
Section 2. And be ü further enacted, That, in
order to meet the present exigencies of the Govern-
ment, the Secretary of the Treasury, with the ap-
probation of the President of the United States, is
hereby authorized to cause Tieasury notes to be
issued to an amount not exceeding two million-.
of dollars, according to the provisions of the act of
October last, &c
Mr JOHNSON of Maryland then took the floor,
and proceeded for a short time, when he gave
•way to
Mr. CHAMBERS of Kentucky, who moved
that the Committee rise , which wao refused, ayes
89, noes 88, the- Chair voting m the negative,
rejects the motion
Mr. C H WILLIAMS remarking that as it
appeared to be a drawn battle, he would renew the
motion
It was then disagreed to—ayes 92, noes 94, taken
by tellers
Mr JOHNSON took the floor for a moment
or two, and some confusion arose on the point of the
Chair's previous decision
Mr ROBERTSON insisted that the Chair gave
its vote after he had announced the decision m the
affirmative, and therefore he had no right to vote
The CHAIR ruled that the House, having acqui-
esce I, by consenting to vote a second time, it was
t( o late to íaise that question.
Mr JOHNSON then proceeded for some time,
when he gave way to
Mr CHAMBERS, who moved that the Co n-
mtttee rise, upon which motion the tellers reported
90 in the affirmative, and 89 in the negative
The CHAIR voted m the negative so the Com-
mittee íefnsed to rise
Mr YORKE renewed the motion to me.
The CHAIR decided that no action having been
had by the Committee since the last vote, the mo-
tion w as out of order
Mr JOHNSON again resumed his remaiks, but
soon gave way to
Mr GRAHAM, of North Caiohna, who moved
that the Committee rise, and appealed to the olde t
members of the House to say if they had e\ er
known any good done in the House on Saturday
at midnight
The question was taken, and decided in the ne-
gative   ye is 88, nays 90
Mr JOHNSON" continued his remarks, and pro-
teged against the necessity or expedient y of foi-
cmg a bill thiough the House, m the night, again t
so large a minoiity—when he yielded the floor to
Mi CLOWNEY, who renewed the motion lo
rise The vote being ascertained, was yeas 88,
nays 91, so ths motion was lost, and
Mr JOHNSON again proceeded for a few mi-
nutes, and then gave way to
Mr GRAVES, who renewed the motion to use,
whioh resulted m the negative  yeas 89, nays 90.
Mi JOHNSON again resumed and proceeded
about a couple of minutes, tthen
Mr DUNN asked him to give way for a motion
to rise
Mr JOHNSON, at first, d ssented, unless the
gentleman fieni Indiana would give him an assu-
rance tint the motion would ptevul
Mi DUNN having expiessed bis belli, f that it
would this time,
Mr JOHNSON yielded the floor, and
Mr DUNN renewed the motion, and it was
again rejected, the tellers reporting ayes 87, noes 89
Mr. JOHNSON then said he should not give
way to his inends again, but would make amotion
himself He then instantly renewed the motion foi
the committee to rise and report progres
Mr HARPER of Ohio rising to address the
House,
Mi  JOHNSON wilhdiew the motion
Mi  HARPER lemonstrated against the haste
with which this important measure wat  uiged on
He disclaimed being opposed to relieve the exigen- ,
cíes of the Government, but wished time to dei ise
the best meana of doing so   He then went at same '
length into the subject of finance  and  banking I
generally, and alter some time gave way to his
colleague,
Mr COFFIN, who moved that the committee
rise
The tellers reported ayes 86, noes 87
Mi BRIGGS, one of the tellers, stated that two
gentleinsn appealed after the ayes were counted,
[Messis Ewao of Indiana and Thompson c f South
Carolina,] whereupon,
Mi HOFFMAN moved for a second coum,
which was ordered, and then the tellers reported—
ayes 88, noes 91, and
Mr. HARPER proceeded, and occupied the
floor till 25 minutes to 12 o'clock, when, without
concluding, he gave way to
Mr HAWES, who renewed his motion for th=
committee to rise, but yielded it to
Mr THOMAS, at his request, who remarked
that it was better to come to some understanding
on the subject, and he would suggest that, for the
mutual convenience of all, they adjourn with the
determination to take up the subject on Monday,
at 12 o'clock, and continue in session till the sub-
ject was disposed of    Cries of "no," "no "
Mr TILLINGHAST then addressed the Chair,
who inquired if the gent'eman from Ohio yielded
the flow
Mr HARPER said he should not do so for any
other purpose than for a motion to rise.
Mr H AWES then made that motion, and the
tellers announcing the division to be ayes 85, noes
87, the committee still refused to adjourn, and
Mr HARPER continued his remarks for a short
time, when he yielded to
Mr ROBERTSON, who, after a few remarks m
suppoit of the expediency of adjourning, made a
motion that the committee rise
The question w as then taken at 12 o'clock, and
the tellers repoi ted ayes 80, noes 83
So the committee refused to rise
Mr HARPER again went on for about a mi
nute, when
Mr CHAMBERS raised the point of order, that
it was 12 o'clock at night, and he hoped no one of
his friends would vote theieafter, and let it be seen
whether an equal number of men could control an
equal number
Mr DUNCAN would like also to know whether
an equal number could control an equal number
The CHAIR then cited the decision on a similar
case, the North Caiohna contested election, and
under that decision he would not decide the pro
ceedmgs estopped, but leave it as a question for the
judgment of the committee itsell The Chair read
that eT-e jt length, and íefeired to others embrac-
ing the same question
Mr CHAMBERS requested the Chair to make
a positive decision
The CHAIR accordingly decided according to
the previous decision of the House
Mr CHAMBERS took an appeal therefrom
Mr POPE moved that the committee rise, for
the purpose of having the point decided m the
House by yeas and navs, with the Speaker in the
Chair Though he held that Sunday was not a
legislative day, he was desirous of seeing who
would so declire by then votes
The CHAIR said the Speaker could not take
the ( hair unless the committee ri«e
Mr POPE then moved that the committe rise
Mr DUNCAN asked if the Chair did not un-
dirsiand the motion and the object o) it
Mi POPr. said the object of his motion was
merely to obtain a decision of the House, whether
they were willing to transact basiness upon the
Sabbath, and he would be willing then to go into
committee again, if the House should decide that
it was piopei
The CHAIR said no conditions could be annexed
to the motion, if the committee rose, it must rise
positive^, and the House would have it in their
power to adjeurn, or to proeeed to any other busi-
ness
Mr POPE said he had avowed hii purpose, and
he bad no othei object in view
Tne vote being taken, the tellers announcing the
division to be—ayes 83, nays 82, and ihe
Ciuir voting in the negative, the question was
lost >
Mr REED  said  he had no  doubt the House
mibht, in a case of necessity sit upon the Sabbath,
but he -would ask if this was such  a case of ne
ccsity as would warrant the House in doing so
Mr CUSHMA.Nsaid there could be no appeal
fron the decision of the committee
The CHAIR sail he had decided that it was m
order to set, and he understood there had been an
appeal from that decision
Mr POPE said he had moved that the committee
rise, for the purpose of getting a decision of the
House, upon the question of order The commit-
tee had decided that they should rise, and the
Chair ought not to have arrested ¡hat decision
He would  put  it  to the candor of the Chair
