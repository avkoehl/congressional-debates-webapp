Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: General W. H. F. Lee pursued the enemy's cavalry which advanced along the South Side Railroad. He had a skirmish on the 22nd near Dinwiddie Court-House, and the next day struck their column in flank near blacks and Whites, cutting in two and getting possession of the road by which they were moving toward Nottoway Court-House. The road was held after an engagement which continued from 12 m. until dark, the enemy making repeated attempts to break through and rejoin his advance. He withdrew from General Lee's front at daylight on the 24th, leaving his dead and wounded on the field, taking the road to Hungarytown and Keysville. General Lee is still following them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
