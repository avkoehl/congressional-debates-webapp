road, with orders to proceed cautiously and endeavor to ascertain if the enemy were on the road. This duty was duly performed, proceeding some 3 miles, but no enemy or signs of them could be found. Two negroes werd found, who stated that they had left Richmond that morn- ing. A full company of cavalry proceeded on the New Market road. They found no enemy, but their tracks at an earlier hour of the morning were plain, and it was ascertained from persons living on the road that a small body of rebel cavalry patrolled the road daily; also that some 200 were encamped or quartered at or iii the neighborhood of New Market We reached within 1~ miles of New Market, but did not see any of them. It was also told from credible sources in the same neigh- borhood that no enemy were statione(l or encamped at this time at Turkey Island Bridge. A Mr. Hare, of that section of country, was arrested, for by his own admission he had been enlisted in a rebel heavy artillery company, though he claimed to be discharged. On searching his premises letters were fou~id which proved conclusively that he was the medium of coin- nmunication between the families in that section and Richmond. Major retained him and handed him over to General Casey at his headquarters. I returned to camp with my command about sundown. Yours, respectfully, WM. ~.
