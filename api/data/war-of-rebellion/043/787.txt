Much credit is also due to the gallant and prompt manner with which Captain A. H. Tanner, in command of the One hundred and twenty-third Regiment New York Volunteers, relieved the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers, and took and held possession of the breastworks until the arrival of the other regiments of the brigade. I cannot omit to acknowledge the cordial co-operation of Colonel Sudsbyrg, of the Third Maryland Volunteers; Colonel Packer, of the Fifth Connecticut Volunteers, and Colonel Selfridge, of the Forty-sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers (though my juniors in rank, yet my seniors in military experience), in all the arduous duties to which this brigade was subjected, not only during the battle at Gettysburg, but both before and during the march afterward and the operations near Williamsport. But higher, and above all, appear conspicuous the courage, endurance, constancy, and fidelity of the men of the six regiments composing the brigade, without an exception; unawed by danger, unsubdued by privation, fatigue, and hardships, no duty could be or was required of them but was promptly and faithfully performed. While my command was not brought into as severe action as others, I deem it safe to assume, if not assert, it performed and was subjected, in connection with other troops of the corps, to more varied movement than any other troops on the field. On July 1, it was placed in position upon the extreme right of the general line. On the morning of the 2d, it was placed in another position, still on the right. We were that forenoon moved 1 1/2 miles to the right center, where we built breastworks. In the afternoon of that day we were marched to the extreme left of the line, to return and find our former position occupied by the enemy. In the morning of the 3d, the corps had a protracted and fearfully severe contest with the enemy in retaking our lost position. This being done, my brigade was moved to the left center to re-enforce troops, and for a while was under the most terrible and desperate attack of the battle. While action in battle did not follow all of these movements, troops from the Twelfth Corps seemed to be everywhere present along that whole line of battle of 6 miles in extent, wherever troops were or might be needed, and always in time, ready for any dire emergency. I append a list of casualties to my report, *and, in conclusion, cannot omit

to mention the efficient aid rendered me during the battle by the various members of my staff. Lieutenant [Darwin S.] Gilger, aide-de-camp, was severely wounded during the terrible artillery fire of the afternoon of the 3d. Captain William Cogswell, assistant inspector-general, rendered me valuable aid, and Captain E. J. Rice, acting assistant adjutant-general, distinguished himself by marked fearlessness, and by being ever present where his services were required, and prompt in their discharge.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

A. L. McDOUGALL,

Colonel 123rd New York Vols., Comdg. First Brigadier

Captain S. E. PITTMAN,

Asst. Adjt. General, First Division, Twelfth Army Corps.
