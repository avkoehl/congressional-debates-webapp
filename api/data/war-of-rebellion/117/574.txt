General W. T. Sherman, commanding at Memphis, received this at 8 p. m. September 28 at hands of Captain Chew, C. S. flag of truce. Lieutenant Tolleson was a prisoner at Memphis but escaped. Know nothing about the Samuel Berry matter. Suppose it is one of the many acts of irregularity caused by the guerrillas. Those who began this first are responsible for the natural consequences.

Forwarded to General Curtis.

Commanding U. S. Forces, Memphis, Tenn.

GENERAL: Private Peebles, of Captain Richardson's company, Provisional Army, C. S., is reported to be a prisoner in the hands of the Federal commander at Helena. He was captured on White River by the force under Colonel Fitch in their attempt to ascend that stream. It is stated that he was clothed in Federal uniform and tied or chained on the wheel-house of a gun-boat, exposed to the fire of our troops, and with the intent to cause him to be killed by the hands of his own comrades. Providence defeated even that barbarity, and the shots probably aimed at him passed him harmlessly and many of them took effect upon his inhuman tormentors. I have to request that he be returned to me exchanged for one of the Federal prisoners sent by me to General Curtis, for the majority of whom I have yet received no equivalent. If you have not jurisdiction in the matter I beg that you forward this communication to the proper officer of your army.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. C. HINDMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General W. T. Sherman received this at hands of Captain Chew, flag of truce. Has no knowledge on the subject. Rather amusing to have Arkansas Independent Partisan Rangers told about civilized warfare.
