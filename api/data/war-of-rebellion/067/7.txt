BETHEL CHURCH, VA., May 22, 1864 - 8 p. m.

(Received 8 a. m., 23d.)

The enemy have evidently fallen behind North Anna. Prisoners have been captured to-day from Pickett's division, and there is evidence of other troops having been sent from Richmond also. Besides these, Breckinridge is said to have arrived. The force under Butler in not detaining 10,000 men in Richmond, and is not even keeping the roads south of the city cut. Under these circumstances I think it advisable to have all of it here except enough to keep a foothold at City Point. If they could all be brought at once to Tappahannock or West Point by water, that would be the best way to bring them. They might march across, but if the enemy should fall back of the South Anna this might become hazardous. Send Smith in command, and send neither artillery nor cavalry unless it is deemed expedient to march over to West Point, thence up north side to join this command. I shall be on the Anna to-morrow or meet the enemy this side. Notify me which way they will be sent.

HEADQUARTERS U. S. ARMIES,Near North Anna, Va., May 23, 1864 - 11 p. m.

(Received 4 p. m., 24th.)

The army moved from its position of this morning to the North Anna, following closely Lee's army. The Firth and Sixth corps marched by way of Harris's Store to Jericho Ford, and the Fifth corps succeeded in effecting a crossing and getting a position without much opposition. Shortly after, however, they wire violently attacked, but handsomely repulsed the assault without much loss to us. We captured some prisoners. The Second Corps holds the bridge just above the railroad, and the Ninth Corps is between that and Jericho Ford, on the north bank, in face of the enemy. It is doubtful whether troops can be crossed except where the Fifth and Sixth Corps are. Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us.
