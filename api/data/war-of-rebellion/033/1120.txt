His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President of the Confederate States:

SIR: We have learned with pleasure that the Indian country will again be created a separate department, to be composed of the troops raised in the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole Nations, and believing as we do that the welfare of the soldier depends in a great measure on the conduct of his commander and having served under Brigadier General D. H. Cooper and found him ever active in doing the best for the troops in his command in the Indian country that could possibly be done for them, and believing, moreover, that his extensive acquaintance with the Indian people and their country would enable him to do more for their wants and defense than one not so well acquainted, we heartily unite with our friends the Creeks and others in recommending him for the appointment of major-general, to command the forces in the department when created; and feeling that due consideration will be given the matter by the proper department, we subscribe ourselves the President's most obedient, humble servants,

JOHN JUMPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Seminole Battalion,

Major,

GEORGE PATTERSO,

Adjutant,

We deeply regret having to say to you that our delegate, in whom we placed full confidence and reliance, has, after a period of two years' warfare upon our country, returned to his people from the seat of your Government, after being received and accepted as a delegate from the Cherokee people to your Congress, and proposes for his own interest, and that of some of his friends, that we, the Cherokee people in council assembled, pass some law by which the introduction of white citizens from the Confederate States can be so effected as to give to each and
