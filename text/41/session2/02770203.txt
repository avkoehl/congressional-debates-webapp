THE INTERNAL REVENUE SYSTEM—IT IS EXPENSIVE
AND INQUISITORIAL. AND SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AT
THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DAY.
At a later stage of the debate the genfclem an
from Ohio [Mr. Stevenson] presented his
views on the general subject. He had pre-
viously denounced the protectionists of the
House as a faction, and now deplores the fact
that 14 the beautiful idea," free trade, 11 cannot
be wholly realized until the commercial millen*
mum." He will, however, do aUhecan to hasten
its triumph. In this direction he goes further
than Calhoun or any southern leader ever went.
His is a manufacturing and agricultural dis-
trict. yet he not only echoes the demand of the
gentleman from the free-trade commercial city

of New York for free coal, iron, salt, and lum-
ber, and a general reduction of the tariff, but
leaps beyond him, and proposes to give perma-
nence to the system of internal taxes, which
was established as a temporary war measure,
and which costs annually over $8,000,000,
-maintains an army of tens of thousands of
office-holders, and makes inquisition into the
private affairs of every citizen, and would
simply remove from it " irritating, petty,
useless, and vexatious elements." Sir, the
gentleman cannot be ignorant of the fact that
every dollar drawn from the people by these
taxes is so much added to the cost of the
productions of the farm and workshop, and
operates as a bonus to the foreign competitors
of our farmers and mechanics in common mar-
kets. But even this will not content him. He
grieves that other and more onerous taxes can-
not constitutionally be levied on the farms,
workshops, and homes of the people of Ohio
and the rest of the country. On this point he
gives forth no uncertain sound. He hopes the
Constitution will yet be so amended as to con-
strain every owner of a farm or cross-road's
blacksmith shop to make the acquaintance of
a collector of United States taxes. On this
point he said :
" In fact, I incline to tho opinion that one of tho
errors committed by our forefathers in framing the
Constitution—and sinco wo have amendod it in suoh
material matters lately, we can afford to say that
they did commit some errors in framing it—was in
not permitting direct taxation upon property accord-
ing to its value. And somo day X trust tho Consti-
tution will permit tho Government to levy taxes upon
property according to its valuo. But until that day,
us long as the debt remains a material burden, we
must, m my judgment, retain tho less objectionable
and burdensome parts of both systems of taxation."
Mr. STEVENSON. I want to know whether
the gentleman does not consider that the mate-
rial part of tho internal revenue taxes must be
continued while the debt remains ?
Mr. KELLEY. No, sir. I believe that if
gentlemen will adopt the tariff bill now under
consideration, extended as is its free list and
great as are the reductions in rates of duties,
we can take the internal taxes off all but eight
articles by a law of this session and go still
further in that direction during the next ses-
sion.
Mr. STEVENSON. What articles are they?
Mr. KELLEY. I will come to that in the
course of my remarks. I have a note of them.
While on this subject let me say that I believe
further, that in the interest of the farmers of
the country we should hasten the day when we
can take the tax off distilled spirits.
Sir, the West has grain for which she can
find no market. The Governments of Great
Britain and France, cooperating with our in-
ternal tax system, deprive them of what would
he a generous market. Take the tax of 05
cents a gallon off whisky, and the grain now
rotting in the granaries of the West would be
distilled into alcohol and shipped to the coun-
tries of South America, the West India Islands,
Turkey, and elsewhere. I have now answered
the gentleman as far as I propose to at pres-
ent. I have, however, not yet done with
him.
Mr. STEVENSON. The gentleman is crit-
icising what was drawn out of me by a question
from himself. I ask him in fairness to permit
me to put a question to him.
Mr. KELLEY. Well, go on.
Mr. STEVENSON. I want to know whether
the gentleman is not in favor, before reducing
the tariff on coal and iron, of taking the internal
revenue tax off whisky and abolishing the tax
on incomes entirely?
Mr. KELLEY. I am in favor of abolishing
at the earliest possible day a system that makes
inquisition into the private affairs of every man
and women in the country, and has oost us for
the three last years an average of $8,509,532 77
per annum, and taken probably 10,000 persons
from industrial employments and fastened them
as vampires upon the people. That is what I
am in favor of. But I hold the floor for another
purpose than a mere controversy with the gen-
tleman.
Mr. STEVENSON. Then the gentleman
declines to answer my question. .
Mr. KELLEY. I have answered the gen-
tleman's question, and every gentleman present
will, I think, say I have answered it frankly.
FREE TRADE MEANS LOW WAGES AND ALIMITED MARKET
FOB GRAIN.
Mr. -Chairman, I am not specially familiar
with the gentleman's district. Though I have
visited Cincinnati several times and ridden
through Hamilton county, I have but few ac-
quaintances within their limits; yet I know
something about them. The last annual report
of the Cincinnati Board of Trade informs us
that during the year ending March 31, 1869,
there were produced in the gentleman's district
and the adjoining one, in about 3,000 sepa-
rate establishments, 187 distinct classes of
manufactured articles, of an aggregate value
of $104,057,612. The cash capital invested
in these establishments, the report says, is
$49,824,124, and they give employment to
55,275 hands.
Mr. Chairman, I venture the remark that
there is not among these 55,275 working peo-
ple one who will indorse the opinions advanced
by the gentleman.
Mr. STEVENSON. Will the gentleman
yield to me for a moment?
Mr. KELLEY. No, sir; I must decline.
Mr. STEVENSON. The gentleman- holds
the floor without restriction by the courtesy of
the House.
Mr. KELLEY. I will yield further to the
gentleman during the course of my remarks,
but not at present.
Many of the laboring people of his district are
immigrants and know how small are the wages
of workmen on the other side of the Atlantic,
and how humble the fare on which they live.
They know that free trade means low wages.
Buy labor where you cau buy it cheapest is the
cardinal maxim of the free trader. More than
85 per cent, of the cost of every ton of coal,
salt, and pig iron is in the wages of labor, and
when the gentleman shall have stricken the
duties off these articles, the 1,500,000 peo-
ple who are now earning good wages in their
production must compete with the cheap labor
of Turk's Island, England, Wales, and Ger-
many. Thrown out of remunerative employ-
ment in the trades to which they have devoted
their lives, as they will be, they must compete
with workmen in other pursuits, even though
they glut the market and bring down the gen-
eral rate of wages throughout the land. He
who advocates protective duties pleads the
cause of the American laborer. I will not
amplify this proposition. I regard it as a tru-
ism, and beg leave to illustrate it by inviting the
attention of my colleague [Mr. Allison] from
Iowa, and the gentleman from Ohio, to a state-
ment of the wages and subsistence of families
of laborers in Europe, on page 179 of the
monthly report of the Deputy Special Commis-
sioner oftheRevenue, No. 4 of the series 1869-
70. It refers specially to Germany, and was
translated and compiled from Nos. 10-12 of
the publications of the royal Prussian statisti-
cal bureau, Berlin, 1868.
This paper, gentlemen will remark, was not
prepared for or by American politicians, or by
a faithless officer of this Government,'or by
any representative of a free-trade or protective
league. Its facts are most significant.
The wheat-growers of Iowa, and the West
are suffering from the want of a market for
tlieir grain. Too large a proportion of our
people are raising wheat. We want more
miners, railroad men, and mechanics, and our
present rates of wages are inducing them to
