Major-General THOMAS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 19, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Eastport:

General Grant has directed that no more cavalry horses be sent to your command till the proposed expeditionary force of General Canby is supplied. General Canby has been ordered to collect all his available force at some point on the Gulf and to move against Selma and Montgomery. It is the wish of General Grant that your army should co-operate by moving upon the same points, if you can be ready in time, or that if this cannot be done, that all your troops not required for defense should be sent to the Gulf to operate with General Canby on that line. It is understood that Beauregard has gone west to bring the remains of Hood's army to South Carolina at oppose Sherman. If so, Canby can easily reach Montgomery, and if not, his movement will hold Hood in check and keep him way from Sherman. You will please communicate your views upon these proposed operations, stating what line you purpose to take, looking at Selma as the objective point, and by what date you will be ready to move; or, if you do not propose a winter campaign from your present base, state now many men you can send to the Gulf. This information is necessary in order that General Grant may give his final instructions for winter operations. If Hood come to the coast, he will probably leave behind a part of Forrest's cavalry to make raids and demonstrations, but they will not be strong enough to do any serious injury.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Memoranda for Cavalry Bureau.

JANUARY 19, 1865.

General Grant directs that no more cavalry horses be sent to General Thomas command till General Canby's forces now preparing for the field, are supplied. They will be send down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, or such other points as General Canby may direct. General Canby will send his requisitions to Saint Louis, and also to Cavalry Bureau. In consideration of these orders, it will not be necessary to establish a new recuperating depot at Nashville; that at Louisville will be sufficient for General Thomas' army. Active measures should be taken to supply General Canby as early as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
