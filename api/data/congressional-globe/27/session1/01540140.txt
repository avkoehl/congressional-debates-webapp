140                                             CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Mr. Brown,] and he (Mr. Bidlack) would only
add that, even in his own district, in the county of
Columbia, there was a population having only one
representative in the last Legislature, which was
larger than m several other counties having two
representatives in thebame body
But he was wtlhag 'o take for granted that this
expression of the Legislature was a true index and
criterion of the sentiments of the people And
what was the first resolution on the subject of dis-
tribution?   It was—
"To resist any and all attempts, undei what pretence soevei
the game may be made, to deprive the people of this State
of their just proportion of the common mheiitance in the pub- 
he lands"
Now, even taking it for granted that this was
a true expression of the opinion of the Legislature,
he, if he were a Senator, should not consider him-
self instructed to vote for a bill on the very
ground set forth m this resolution. And when
he came to the details of the, bill, he would show
why.
Here was the second resolution:
"To introduce and advocate the passage of a bill pioviding
for the distribution of the proceeds of the same (public lands]
among the several States, in the ratio of their federal repre
sentative population, under the census of one thousand eight
hundred and tony "
Here was the same idea again It was to be
a distribution in proportion to the Federal re-
presentative population un 'er the census. And
this was not such a distribution; nor was it
such a distribution as the resolution of the chair-
man of the committee contemplated; and he
hoped that that gentleman [Mr. Lawrence]
would be permitted, if no one el¡>e was, to speak,
when this bill came into the House; and t^at he,
or some other member from Pennsylvania, might
tffer such an amendment as wou'd at least
make this bill comply with the wishes of the Legis-
lature of last winter, and with tht principles of
fee resolution which the chairman himself had
offeied.
Mr B. then referí id to the first section of the
bill, which gives (en per cent &c to the nine new
Slates therein named, m addmon to the two per
cent, hereto'oie given And he referred to the re-
port of the Secretary of the Treasury in 1839, to
show that thebu S'ahs had already íeceived twelve
and a half million of acre  of these very lands
In addition to this, (Mr. B. sud,) it appears to
me that th  piovision  of the bill are not only un-
just in their operation on the old States, who knt
their treasure and blood to the acquisition and pro-
tection of these lands, but unjust m their operation
in relation to thet e very Western States themselves,
for the seventh section piovided lhat four hundred
thousand acies of lind were to b> givn to the e
Slates for purposes of internal impioviinents And
for this four hundred thousand, I believe, Jive hun-
dred thou«and is to be substituted
Mr. W C JOHNSON was understood to inti-
mate that such was the intention of the Committee
on the Public Lands
Mr. BIDLACK proceeded to argue the injustice
of this provision upon the t Id States, and entered
into many details with that view He denied that
such a distribution would be in accordance with
equity, or justice, or the solemn terms of the com-
pact. He b'heved that the people of Pennsylva-
nia would never be contented \vtth it, and, looking
to the injustice of the distribution itself, he thought
that every Penns>ivanta Repre entative here,
whatever might be his opinion as to fie principle if
distribution, should oppose thi" bill on account of its
details. Let gentlemen take tit ier side ofthequss
Hon, let them say, on the cne hand, that the 'and be-
longed to the Stales, or, on ihe other, that it be-
longed to the United S a'es, on either groun I, the
distribution, if made at all, should be an equal dis-
tubuuon But he d^n cd that it beionz.ed to tne
Stales If it did, and if they «ere entitled to 't
at all, they were entitled to it in equal shares, ac
coidmg to their proportions in the gentil charge
of expenditure lie d ned that "uch a dts nbu-
tion would be carrying out toe terms- of the co n-
pact,and this, too, even on the ground that the
land belonged to the StiUs
Mr B. then entered into the consti uttonal argu-
ment for the purpose of thowmg ¡hat the 1 nd was
the properly of the United Slates and not of the
State5; including both the ladd ceded and the land
purchased. But, Mr. B contended, whether it was
the property of the United States or o' the State*,
the distribution, if there was any, should operate
on aU alike. He then proceeded to show the in-
compatibility of such a principle with the doctrine
of S ate sovereignty and State rights.
Mr. B. next directed his remarks to the proof of
the fact which he asserted, that there was no excess
of the proceed.* of the sales of these lands beyond
the expenditures A number of estimates, &c
were read on this point, which gave rise to some
explanations from Mr. Howard m relation to esti-
mates submitted by him yesterday on 'hat point
The Reporter cannot at this time follow these esti-
mates out.
Mr. B then contended that, if, as he believed,
thts land was the property of the united States,
Congress had no more right to distribute the pro-
ceeds of the sales of it than to raise a surplus by a
course of legislation affecting the tariff and he im-
posts of the country, and distribute that Bu' even
if that weie to be done, the principle recognised by
this bill wojld only leal to a scramble between the
State  as to who should receive the largest pmount.
And he beseecned tht. gentlemen, if they were go-
ing to recognise the doctrine that tan immense do-
main belonged to the States, and that the proceeds
were to be distributed among the S ates, that they
would at least lay down some general principle
which should be binding upon their futare legisla-
tion; that nothing would be left ambiguous or un-
certain He would acU them to adhere to the prin-
ciples recognised by the deeds of cession. If, on
the other hand, they adopted the sull more start-
ling doctrine that the General Government had a
right to levy trices for the purpjse of pccumulatmg
a fund to be afterwards returned, b; which thp peo-
ple should receive about 75 cents on every dil'ar
they were required to pay, he a^fced them not to
make the burden more onerous noon any one por-
tion of the Union by establishing the precedent that
the distribution wai to depend upi n the mere will
and caprice of the Legislature (or the time being
He asked gentlemen to ponder well before they
acted, and to look well to the serious results which
¡nu>t inevitably follow such a course of legu'ati m
Mr. PICKENS then obtai.ied the fio ir, and it
being within a few minutes of 3 o'clock, moved
that the committee rise.
Which motion prevailing, the committee rose,
reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again.
Mr. W C JOHNSON (a suspension of the rules
havirg been agreed to) introduced the following
resolution
Resolved, That the Committee on the Public Lands be m
stiucted to inquire into the justice ¿n 1 expediency of repoitmg

o ates necessary to the establishment ol branches within their

Mr CHQATE addiessed the Senate at some length in favor
of the amendment While he acknowledged that he had no
doubts in his own mind as to the constitutional power of the
Government Xo establish bratiches m the States, he said the
opinions of others who entertained dlfterentsentlments should be
respected, and thought the mere assertion of the powenmpohtic,
when it was not necessary for the practical efficiency of the
measure, and when its assertion might endanger the success of
the measure He had no doubt, indeed he would say that ho
knew, if this amendment was not agreed to, no bank bill would
pass into a haw during the present session and the country
would be deprived of this important measure of relief so much
needed and expected                                                                          *■
Mr CLAY of Kentui ky begged to be permitted to ask the
Senator fiom Massachusetts a single question The Senatoi
asserts positively, that we are to have no Bank this session,
unless the amendment is adopted—that he teows-it Now he
had every respect for the arguments and opinions of the Sena
tor from Massachusetts, but when he goes beyond an exprés
sion of opinion, and positively asserts that he knows there will
be no Bank bill this session, an inference is lelt to be diawn,
which compelled him to rise and call on him to give grounds on
which he makes this broad asoeition
Mr CHOATB Surely the Senator from Kentucky will al
low me, without interruption, the light of expiessmg manfully
my firm conviction, without being obliged to give reasons
which I cannot give without a breach of piivilege, or violating -
a parliamentary i ule, which I do not feel disposed to violate
Hell the Senator again there will be no Bank this session unless
this amendment prevails
Mr C thenpioceeded mhis remarks, and closed with an ap
peal to the Senator fiom the green island who sat by his side,
[Mr Simmons ] to join m this attempt to reconcile the difFe
re-ices of sen'iment which were honestly entertained by the
friends of the Administration on this question
Mr SIMMONS responded to the appeal, by saying that
while he had eveiy i espect for the opinions of othei Senators,
he could not yield the firm convictions of his own mind on this
subject. He considered the concession asked by the amend-
ment an abandonment of the whole question of the power of the
Federal Government to establish these branches, which he no
more doubted than that it had the power to establish post
offices, land offices, or custom houses
Mi. ARCHER followed and confined his remarks principally
to an analysis of the speech of his colleague, [Mr Rives,] on
the day preceding He considered the amendment proposed as
involving principles much more obnoxious to the Constitution
than the section foi which it was proposed as a substitute He
considered that the amendment hid not a single real friend on
that floor, and not a single argument had been offeied in its be
half except that it was the scheme of the Executive This
kind of argument he repudiated as unbecoming that body, and
he regretted that the distinguished Senator fiom Kentucky had
countenanced it by attempting to draw from the Senator from
Massachusetts [Mr Choate.] ihe opinions of the Executive on
the subject
Mr CLAY asked the Senatoi from Virginia to allow him to
explain what he did say He had intenupled the ¡senator fiom
Massachusetts toasieitain upon whatgiound the assemon was
made, positively mtde, that there could be no Bank but the
thing tendered by Ihe gentleman from Virginia It did not fot
low lhat the flet stated depended on the dcteimiiiaiion of the
Executive If might he lhat the gentleman hid polled one or
the other ol the legislative blanches, and found iha^ the thing
now presented wab the only measuie thatcouldbe earned
Mr CIIOATE made some explanation, not distinctly heard
It wis unueistood to be, that he had not made use of the name
oi official authority of the Executive, but had expressed his
conviction, derived from many facts and deductions, which he
did not think necessary to explain
M' CLAY 1 am satisfied that the honoi able Senator made
an assertion much stronger than that which he now makes He
said he knew there would be no Hank this session, unless this
amendment was adopted I wanted to asceitain how he knew
the fact I might not have been authorized in supposing he
knew it ftom the Executive, he might have derived his know
leaVe from the other blanch bet I wanted to know where he
got the fact from
Mi CHO \ TE It is proper for me to say that I never ex
changed a syllaolc with the Executive, or del ived from his lips
any expiession on thissubject l said that 1 believed this was
the only way we had to get a Bank this session, and 1 stated
distinctly that I had no authority foi saying this from the Exe-
cutive or any one else whom the Senator from Kentucky al
ludes to as my supposed authority I stated my own convic
tions
Mr CLAY Trise, sir, to vindicate myself from the infer-
ence that I had no grounds foi questioning the Senator when I
mteuuptedhim The mfeience lhat I interfeied in conbe
quence of a mere expression of his opinion is not wananted
I did no such thing The gentleman said that he knew we
would have no Bank this session unless we adopted this
amendment He made the assertion most positively, as if fiom
the authority of some competent power to r"ndei the measure ,
nugatory I wanted to know what authority he had for the
assertion, and, for that purpose alone, I interrupted him
Mr CHO ATE I gave my convict on The Senator from
Keiticky asked me what grounds I rested my belief upon, I
replied that I based them on facts and deductions I did not
think propel todisc!o°e I did not, in giving convictions from
a belief I could nor control, mply that I had any Lxecutive
authority for what I stated
Mr CI AY Will the gentleman say that he did not, m an
swer to my direct mterrogit jry sute that he could not disclose
the source of his convictions without a bleach of privilege and
violation of pal hamentary rulei
Mr L BO\TE attempted again to evplain,but wis interrupted
by Mr Ci ay
Mr CI AY That, sir, is not the thing Did you not say
that you could not, without bteach of puvilege, and violation of
puliamentaiy rule, disclose youi authority"*
Mi CIIOATE So 1 insist on my right to explain what I
did siv m my own war Is                                    *
