drove in the enemy's pickets. I have heard but little firing in your direction, and now can hear none at all. Please give me informaiton from time to time what to do. Soon as I get my troops across I shall move on. The ford is growing worse and worse, and citizens inform me that if many troops cross it will become impassable. The force at Dismal Cross-Roads being still there this morning, I have been forced to keep a strong picket on the road leading in that direction.

Respectfully, major, your obedient servant,
