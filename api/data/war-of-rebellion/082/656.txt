General CRAWFORD:

General Burnside has secured a lodgment in the enemy's line. I send you a dispatch just received.* I wish you would take Baxter's brigade and half of Lyle's and make the demonstration indicated in the dispatch, if practicable.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, July 30, 1864.

(Received 8 a. m.)

[Major General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: The lead-works are over one mile from the angle of my picket-line. I do not think an attack upon the enemy's works at or near that point at all practicable with the force I can spare. I can make a demonstration if it is desired. The cavalry are moving and will have the left uncovered.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,
