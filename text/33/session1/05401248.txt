jority.
Mr. MORGAN. Upon the motion of the gen-
tleman from Illinois I demand the yeas and nays.
Mr. CLINGrMAN. 1 submit that that motion
is not in order.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
question of order made by. the gentleman from
North Carolina, and decides the motion to be in
order.
Mr. WALSH. I rise to a question of order.
I now renew the point I madesome time ago, that
motions which are made with the express view,
with the express intention, to retard the business
of the House, are not in order.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
quention of order.
Mr. WALSH. r then appeal from the decision
of the Chair. [Laughter.]
Mr. CLING-MAN. I move to lay themotion
to reconsider upon the table.
Mr. SAGE. I demand the yeas and nays upon
that motion.
Mr. MATTESON. I demand tellers upon
ordenng the yeas and nays.

tlemen upon whom I rely, f withdraw my appeal.

So the Houce refused to adjourn.
The question then recurred upon the motion to
lay the hill upon the table.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I demand
the yeas and nays upon that motion.
Mr. STUART, of Ohio. I made the motion to
recommit the bill to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union.
Mr. CLINGMAN. That motion is not in
order.
Mr. STUART. The Chair ruled that motion
to be out of order. I now renew that motion, and
I call the attention of the Chair to the 120th rule,
with the note thereto.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio
moves to recommit the bill to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, and refers
to the 120th rule. The Chair has read that rule
once or twice to-day, and cannot be mistaken in
reference to its construction. The rule is express
upon the subject.
Mr. STUART. Does not the note say after
the previous question has been seconded? '
The SPEAKER. The Chair has no doubt that
that note was put there long before the present
rule was in existence. At ail events, there is no
note that can overturn a direct rule. It is pro-
vided by an express rule that a demand for the
previous question cuts off all debate, motions to
commit, motions to amend, motions to postpone
to a day certain, and to postpone indefinitely,and
brings the House to a direct vote upon the main
question, first upon the amendment, if there be
one pending-. Under this rule, therefore, a motion
to commit is not m order.
The yeas and nays were ordered upon the ques-
tion to lay the bill upon the table.
The question was then taken on the motion that
the hill do lie upon the table; and it was decided
in the negative—yeas 92, nays 112; as follows:

table.
Pending the above call,
Mr. BUGGsaid: Mr. Speaker,! was not with-
in the bar when my name was called, and I now
ask the unanimoub consent of the House to record
my vote in favor of laying the billup'on the table.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I object to anybody voting
who was not within the bar when his name was
called.
The SPEAKER. Objection being made, the
gentleman cannot vote, if he was not within the
bar when his name was called.
Mr. BUGG. I will then say, that if I had been
within the bar when my name was called, T should
have voted in favor of the motion*that the bill do
he upon the table.
The SPEAKER. The question is now on sec-
onding the demand for the previous question.
