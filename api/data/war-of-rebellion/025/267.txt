BETHEL, October 6, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Seven prisoners from Price's army, General Moore's brigade, are just brought in by scouts, and they report that the whole brigade, five regiments, Forty-second Alabama, Thirty-fifth Mississippi, Second Arkansas Regiments, and one Texas regiment threw away their arms at Davis' Bridge and every man scattered. This occurred when Hurlbut first attacked their rear. They are a miserable, squalid, starved set. What shall I do with them? Lieutenant Grimes, who is in charge of scouts, reports the woods filled with them.

I. N. HAYNIE,

Colonel, Commanding.

BETHEL, October 6, 1862.

General GRANT:

Prisoners from Price's army, brought in this a. m. by my scouts from near Chewalla, say that rebels admit loss of 4,000, and that a General Martin was killed; they saw his body. They report Price's army in a state of starvation. Really the looks of the men confirm it. No news of the rebels' movements this morning.

I. N. HAYNIE,

Colonel, Commanding.

HATCHIE, October 6, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Jackson:

I am compelled to send back for transportation for my wounded. I am out of rations. The enemy have twenty-four hours' start and are flying light and cannot be overhauled by my command. Rosecrans is in pursuit, as I am told, but my command is too much crippled in wounded men and dead artillery horses to follow.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

HATCHIE, TENN., October 6, 1862.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: My battery horses are badly cut, ammunition short, and only one day's rations around. I have not wagons and ambulances enough to move my wounded, and must return to Bolivar.

Your obedient servant,

[S. A. HURLBUT,]

Major-General.

JACKSON, TENN., October 7, 1862-2 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

If possible, have McPherson made major-general. He should be made at once, to take above others who may be promoted for the late battles.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.
