DUTCH GAP, VA., September 21, 1864.

Colonel HENRY L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy have fired as usual to-day, doing but little damage. Most of their mortar shells burst in and around my right battery. As long they direct their attention there I am satisfied, and the labor on the canal need not be interrupted. Their light pieces do no hurt, except to the men, who return their fire.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing of importance on my line. The work on it is progressing with great rapidity. The salute was fired and with considerable effect on the enemy's work. A detailed report will be forwarded. The enemy responded feebly.
