HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 20, 1864 - 9.20 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

The firing last night at 10 o'clock occurred when we changed our pickets and did not result in any great harm on either side. It did not strike me at the time as of sufficient importance to report, but I now see that it should have been reported and in future will report in such occasions. Since that time everything has been quiet along our front except the ordinary skirmish fire.
