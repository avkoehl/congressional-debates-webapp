COLLECTION DISTRICT IN NEW MEXICO.
Mr. HAMLIN. The Committee on Com-
merce, to whom was referred a memorial of citi-
zens of New Mexico, praying for the establish-
ment of a collection district in that Territory, or
in the State of Texas, have directed me to report
a bill " creating a port of entry at Frontera, m
the State of Texas." I ask that the bill may be
considered at this time. There is no officer of the
revenue now in that Territory.
The bill was read a first and second time by
unanimous consent, and considered as in Commit-
tee of the Whole.
It proposes to create the county of El Paso, in
the State of Texas, and the Territory of New
Mexico, a collection district, to be called the dis-
trict of Paso del Norte, the port of entry for which
is to be Frontera. There is to be a collector of
the customs, to reside at Frontera, at a salary not
exceeding $2,000, including in that sum, the fees
allowed by law.
The bill further provides that the district court
of the Territory of New Mexico shall have, and
exercise jurisdiction over all cases arising in the
collection district of Paso del Norte, in the admin-
istration of the revenue laws, in the same manner
as if the district were entirely within the Territory
of New Mexico.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read a third time, and passed.
RAILROAD IN MINNESOTA.
Mr. STUART. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, to whom was referred

in the construction of a railroad therein, to report
the same back without amendment, and to ask fol-
ks present consideration.
The PRESIDENT. The Senator from Michi-
gan asks the unanimous consent of the Senate to
consider this bill now.
Mr. EVANS. I object.
Mr. STUART. I suppose it is in order for
me to submit a motion to take up the bill, as it was
twice read before being referred.
The PRESIDENT. Objection being made, it
goes upon the Calendar.
Mr. STUART. Is it not in order for me now
to submit a motion to take up the bill?
The PRESIDENT. The bill having just been
reported, must lie over for one day, unless by
unanimous consent.

S The collector to be appointed for the district is to

MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
A message was received from the House of

announcing that they had passed a joint resolution
directing the connection of the public surveys in
Alabama, with the boundary line between the
States of Alabama and Florida, in which they
requested the concurrence of the Senate.
ORDER OF BUSINESS WASHINGTON ANt)
ALEXANDRIA RAILROAD.
Mr. MASON. 1 ask leave to present a memo-
rial of the corporate authorities of the city of
Washington, asking for the passage of the bill
now before the Senate " authorizing the extension
of the Alexandria and Washington railroad into
the District of Columbia." That bill was under
consideration on Thursday last, and was then
laid over until the next day. There are reasons
which induce me to believe that the public interest
and the public convenience are involved in its
speedy passage. I therefore ask the Senate now
to take it up and dispose of it.
Mr. PEARCE. I submit to the Senator from
Virginia to allow me to make another motion
prior lo his. 1 am called away by peculiar cir-
cumstances from the city. 1 shall be obliged
to leave this afternoon at an early hour. I am
anxious before I go to induce the Senate to take up
a bill which has been for a long time in my charge,
and in which my State is interested. It is a bill
directing a reexamination of the account between
theUnited States and the State of Maryland.
Mr. MASON. 1 am very reluctant not to
agree to the proposition of the Senator; but I ask
him whether on his return it will not do as well to
take up that bill ?
Mr. PEARCE. I think it is very desirable it
should be taken up now. It has been in my
charge for about three months. I had hoped it
would come up in its turn, but other bills have
been taken up out of their turn, and now I am
compelled to go away, and, therefore, I ask for the
consideration of my bill.
Mr. MASON. I am sorry to decline acceding
to the request, but I hope we shall have the pleas-
ure of the Senator's company back with us very
soon, and the bill which 1 wish to take up is really
a matter of pressing emergency in which his con-
stituents, as well as mine, are concerned.
Mr. BRIGHT. I hope the motion of the Sen-
ator from Virginia will not prevail. It is very
evident that if that question be taken up, the day
will be consumed in discussing it. I should prefer
that the morning business be disposed of, and then
that the motion of the honorable Senator from
Maryland prevail. There is an urgent necessity
for his leaving the city, and I think it is due to him
after the morning business shall be disposed of,
that his bill be taken up.
Mr. PRATT. After what has fallen from my
colleague, I beg leave-to say that I do not appre-
hend the bill which he asks to have taken up will
lead to debate. I think it will only be necessary
to state the grounds on which the Committee on
Finance unanimously reported in its favor to in-
duce the Senate unanimously to pass it. The bill
which the honorable Senator from Virginia pro-
poses to take up, however, will undoubtedly con-
sume the whole day if it be taken up. It can be
of no importance with reference to the Potomac
bridge whether we pass to-day, or to-morrow, or
next day, a provision authorizing a railroad to be
made across it. .
Mr ADAMS. Mr. President, I dislike to op-
pose motions made by my friend from Virginia;
but I beยฐ* leave to call the attention of the Senate
to the fact that the House of Representatives, some
days since, passed a bill fixing the time for the
annual meeting of Congress on the first Monday of
November, in lieu of tne time now fixed the first
Monday in December. We amended their ad-
journing resolution of this session, ant! sent it ba.ck
to them. They cannot act advisedly upon our
amendment to the adjourning resolution until they
see what the Senate does in reference to the bill
which they have passed changing the time for the
meeting of Congress.
