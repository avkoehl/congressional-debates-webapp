Or a yearly average ol 1,757,150 pounds; or five sixths
more than the usual number.
Thus, it will be seen that five sixths of the print-
ing that is done is extra printing. If we abolish
the franking privilege, I believe that extra print-
ing will be put an end to almost wholly. The
documents which 1 have presented, however, do
not show the whole burden thrown upon the mails
by the franking privilege. There is a large num-
ber of speeches and pamphlets and documents of
various kinds that pass through the folding-room
of the Senate and House of Representatives which
do not come under the control of the Superintend- ;
ent of Public Printing. I have been furnished by !
the Superintendent of the Senate folding-room |
with a statement showing the number of such j
pamphlets and newspapers folded in the folding- I
room of the Senate during the last two Con-
gresses:

JOSEPH lIRDRlCK,
Superintendent Senate Folding-Room.
Ihavc no statement showing the number of doc-
uments of this description which has passed
through the folding-room of the House of Repre-
sentatives. 1 called yesterday evening upon the
superintendent of that branch for a similar state-
ment to this, but he informed me that he was a
good deal uneasy, and thought, perhaps, that his
head would be taken off to-day, but said that, if
it'were not, he would furnish me with the state-
ment to-morrow. The yearly average of the state-
ment I have just read, with regard to our own
folding-room, is one hundred and thirty thousand
eight hundred, and twenty-one and a quarter
pounds. I suppose it is fair to presume that four
times the quantity passes through the folding-room
of the other House; adding for that House five
hundred and twenty three thousand two hundred
and eighty-five pounds,'and we have a total an-
nual average of six hundred and fifty-four thou-
sand one hundred and six pounds of matter which
passes through the folding-rooms of the two
Houses. Adding this to the yearly average of
the extra documents exhibited by the statement
of the Superintendent of the Public Printing, and
we have an annual burden of more than two mil-
lion and a quarter pounds thiown upon the mails
in consequence of franking printed matter. Nor
is this all. You must take into consideration the
additional mail-bags and wrapping paper required,
and the salaries of the persons employed in fold-
ing the documents and in carrying them from the
folding-rooms to the post office.
I think, then, I am fully justified in saying that
this measure will effect a saving of $500,000 a
year, at least, in the public printing; but, if I am
not mistaken, it will cause a much larger saving
in the expense of transporting the mails. I find
in the report of the Postmaster General:
"It is well known that the expenses of the Department
for tianspoitation have lapidiy increased wiihin the last ten
years. In J849, they amounted to $2,577,407 71; but for
the yeai ending the 30th of June, 18j9, they reached the
sum of $9,'478,457. This has been piodured by the enor-
mous bulk and weight of the mails, which are principally
due to the va«t quantity of heavy books and printed docu-
ments sent under the Government fiank. Mails which but
recently weighed a few hundred pounds, are now, from this
cause, found weighing tons.
You will observe that in the last ten years the
expenses of mail transportation have increased
to the extent of #6,901,050. I am aware that a
large poition of that increase is to be attributed to
the cost of the postal service required in order to
enable us to reach our Pacific settlements. But I
will deduct the expense of that from the total in-
crease, and then let us see howlt stands. I find
from the Postmaster General's report the follow-
ing statements:
u Pacific Mails,—On taking charge of this Department,
J found established and in full opetation six different routes
for carrying the mails to and fiom California and our other
Pacific po.-session*, namely :
1. From New York and New Oi~ CosL Receipts.
leans, via Panama, to San
Fiancisco, semi-monthly ,$738,250 $299,972 69
2. Fiom New Orleans to fcJan Fian-
cisco, \ia Tehauntepoc, semi
monthly  250,000 5,276 68
3. Fiom Han Antonio, viaE! Paso,
to San Diego, bemi-m«inlhl},
{weekly from San Antonio to
El Pa--o and Fort Yuma).... 196 ^48 601 00
4. Fiom St. Louis and Memphis,
via El Pa%o, to San Francisco, 600,000 27,229 94
5. From Kansas, Missouri, to
Stockton, California, monthly, 79,999 1,255 00
6. From St. Joseph's, Missouri,
via Utah city, to Placerville,
weekly  320,000 5,412 03
"The gross annual disbursements for these six routes Were
thus $2,184,677, and the receipts from them but @339,747 34,
showing a loss to the Department of $1,844,949 66 per an-
num.
** The expenditures for local mail service in the States of
California and Oregon, and in Utah and Washington Ter-
ritories, during the past year,- amounted to $508,697 13,
which being added to the cost of the routes named, gives
a total of $1,693,394 13."
I have deducted from this increase the entire
cost of the transportation of the Pacific mails by
land and water, and the expenditures for local
mails in the States of California and Oregon, and
in Utah and Washington Territories, and there
is still an increase of $4,267,645 16 over the cost
of transportation ten years ago. I then deduct
from that sum, for increased service in other than
the Pacific States and the Territories of Utah and
Washington, $2,207,645 16, and that will leave
$2,000,000, which I hold will be the least that
will be saved in the transportation of the mails
by the abolition of the franking privilege.
I am fully aware that this relief, in the way of
transportation, will not fully take effect tin til the
contracts that are now made by those who carry
the mails shall have expired. I understand, how-
ever, from the Senator from Georgia, thai the
Postmaster General has it in his power to reduce
the service, and in that way, perhaps, relief may
be very speedily granted, to a limited extent at
least. But when the contracts shall come to be
relet, if those who put in bids for carrying the
mails find that this very large amount of extra
trash that is printed by the two Houses of Con-
gress is not to go through the mails, they will, of
course, lessen their bids; and the contracts for
transportation, I venture to say, will indicate, f&ur
years hence, that more than two million dollars
have been saved to the Government by the abo-
lition of this franking privilege.
If 1 am correct, $1,800,000 postage will be re-
ceived from the matter that is now free; there will
be on the printing a saving of $500,000, and on
a asportation a saving of #2,000,000. That will
be an annual saving of $4,300,000 to the Govern-
ment, all of which, I believe, will be effected by
the abolition of the franking privilege.
This amendment proposes an entire abolition of
this privilege. I have heard no objection, as I
before said, to its abolition; but it is said this is
not the time, and that the bill before the Senate is
not the place where this amendment should be put.
The proviso, to which there was some exception,
I think shields members of the two Houses from
any burdens that they might think would be
thrown upon them in answering the correspond-
ence of their constituents. The amendment, as
proposed, requires all the letters to be pre-paid.
That is now the law; it does not alter that. The
proviso only allows those who enjoy the franking
privilege to place their frank upon a letter, and
that will allow it to go without being prepaid, and
the party who receives it must pay the postage
before he takes it out of the office. That cer-
tainly will relieve members of any burden in con-
sequence of keeping up correspondence with their
constituents. If a correspondent writes to a gen-
tleman on his own bitsiness, and he replies, the
reply being upon the business of the constituent,
of course the member will put his frank upon it,
as he now does, and the party in interest will have
to pay the postage when he shall receive it. If&
Senator replicrs on his own business, of course he
will pre-pay the postage.
The reason that has been assigned for the ex-
istence of the franking privilege is that the people
should have every facility to communicate freely
with their Representative, and the Representative
should have a corresponding facility to communi-
cate with his constituents. I think, under this
amendment, the Representative, if he desires to
communicate with his constituents, on his constit-
uents' business, certainly can do it without any
charge upon himself; and the small amount that
the Post Office Department now charges upon
letters is certainlyso insignificant as not to prevent
any man from having free communication with his
Representative, if he wishes it.
Another reason that is urged for the franking
privilege—and that is a reason that was urged in
the debates in 1791, when this matter was under
consideration in Congress—is the dissemination
of intelligence among the people. It was urged,
then, that if the practice continued of loading the
mails with franked matter, it would ultimately
