WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

November 3, 1864.

GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY,

Frankfort, Ky.:

The authority given to raise four infantry regiments is hereby revoked. The men already raised are to be assigned to cavalry regiments, under the direction of Major-General Burbridge.

By order of the Secretary of War:

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DETROIT, November 3, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Unless you can suggest some better mode of raising a regiment for service on the line from foot of Lake Huron to Malden, I recommend that authority be given the Governor of Michigan to raise a volunteers regiment for twelve months, unless sooner discharged. This additional force is absolutely necessary, and should be organized before the Detroit River is frozen over. The adjutant-general of the State informs me that the regiment can be formed at once, and that arms, accouterments, and clothing are now on hand for it. No lesser force can render the frontier of Michigan secure from the incursions of the disaffected in Canada. Please answer as soon as convenient.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, November 4, 1864.

Major General JOSEPH HOOKER,

Detroit, Mich.:

The Adjutant-Genera has been directed to issue authority to the Governor of Michigan to raise a regiment of twelve-months" volunteers, as recommended in your telegram of yesterday.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
