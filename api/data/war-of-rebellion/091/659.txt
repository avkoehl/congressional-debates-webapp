KERNSTOWN, VA., November 22, 1864.

(Received 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just heard from the cavalry in the main valley, at Mount jackson. Only Kershaw's division has gone to Richmond; it is about 5,000 strong. The balance of the rebel force was still a short distance south of New Market, up to Sunday morning, and no indication of a movement. The cavalry had some sharp artillery practice at or near Mount Jackson this afternoon, but I have not yet heard any particulars about it.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
