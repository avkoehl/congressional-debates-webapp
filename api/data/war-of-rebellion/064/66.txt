The general commanding directs me to ask you where Captain Moore is, who commanded the company at Wellington, and if you cannot station the company at Millwood Church at Wellington?

Commanding:

Colonel Philips reports to enemy in the vicinity of Warsaw. It is a canard. All Colonel McFerran's regiment are on the scout, except small squads at Lexington and Warrensburg. Captain Moore's case is as ordered-investigated several days since.
