defenses, having been relieved from command of his corps? He arrived yesterday at about 2 o'clock, but finding in what condition affairs were here with respect to command did not assume command, but telegraphed to General Grant, inquiring what was to be his status. He has not yet received a reply. If without receiving one he observes his orders and assume command here what is to be my status? Do I still report to you or only to him, or to both, and what is the relation between himself and you? He did not desire that you should be informed until he received a reply from General Grant. Under the circumstances, however, I think it best and just to myself to inform you. Please reply immediately.

APRIL [3], 1865.

General DEVENS:

When I order you to move leave your deadbeats and a few garrison for each work. Take two batteries, but have the rest harnessed up, so that you can call for them easily. Take the New Market road with infantry, and let the cavalry go up Darbytown road, sending scouts along Charles city road. I will be with either column and notify you from time to time. I will send you word when to start.
