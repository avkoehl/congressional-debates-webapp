Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Commanding Department, Charleston, S. C.:

Wheeler reported he had gone toward Augusta in obedience to your instructions, leaving 1,400 men to support Stevenson and McLaws. Former officer reports not having yet seen them. Present management of the cavalry surpasses my understanding.
