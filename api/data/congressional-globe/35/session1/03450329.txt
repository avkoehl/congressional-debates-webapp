APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
329
35th Cong....1st Sess.
Special Kansas Committee—Mr. Letcher.
Ho. of Reps.
and that this would be an article in the Demo- '
cratic creed. ;
The day but one after the inauguration of P^s- 1
ident Buchanan, Dred Scott was decided; and the
position ot the party to day, on this Lecompton
constitution, vetifies but too well the other pait ;
of the prediction. And, sir, if the Adnunistui- ,
lion, in this gross and violent outiage upon their I
rights, is sanctioned and sustained by the Amer-
ican people, I will ventureanotherprediction:that
when the Lemmon case, now before the courts ,
in New York, shad find its way to the same tri- ,
banal which decided Dred Scott, slavery, by vir- |
tuc of it, will be planted m every free State of the
Union.
That this statement, Mr. Chairman, is no mere
bugbear, with no foundation on which to base
it, and as additional evidence tending to show ■
which way the Demos uitic cuirent is dufiing
in this particular, 1 quote from an article jn the
Washington Union, of November 17, 1857, but
a few days before the President's was
sent to Congress, The quotation which i have
made from the message contains, in elfect, though
expressed in terms a little morn ambiguous, the ;
same sentiments which are more boldly avowed j
in this article from the Government orjjan. <

Let the honest masses of the Democratic pai ty
in the free States ponder well the position occu-
pied by their party on this most vital quotum !
Sir, i oppose this measure, and piotest against
H, because 1 r contains tins an h- re publican fra'ut e, ■
which, I belie\e, has never bofote found a place !
in any constitution, that the " right of propctty
in slaves is higher than any constitutional sanc-
tion." Slavery, m other const: tut ions and 10 b-il-
lative enactments, any hive been lecoonized as
an existing imrimuoir but never before, to m\

that by v  loch other pr..p.-i ty n-5 'held fS.)\ this

(')inmon law, and upon the tno^ress, phiLinfhro-
py, civilization, and spirit of the n;r^ hi winch w e
live. It is a waiiton departure from the e.uly Kuril
of the falliers <>{ the Ib-pubnc Oil (he («uesiion of !
slavery, and will be a sn^tr 1 and a reproach upon
rho country m all coming time.
Sir, it js send by iho niie.nan from CU or^ja,
| Mr. Hill,] who, m a v. rv c.ihn and modulate
manner, has advocated tin ^ ui, -isure, thai, in op-
}iosing- it, not one woi d should ha\ e been saitl by
men of the ISorh about the institution of si.ivory i
in connection wuh it. YVhy,sn\whafoverdoctrme >
is applied to temtory south of the Missouri com-
promise line, all north of it was, by a solemn com-
pact, consecrated and s- t apart to freedom and t<> ■
free labor. Th«it terntoi v was enrs, by agreement
of patriots South as well as No: th. Wchaw&.en <
that compromise ruthlessly \i<dated and \n-(>k> n
cioWii; and there has not been a moment, since ;
that fell measure wa*? sprung up.nn tho counrry} i
thnt, tlie prime and secret movers in it have not :
I'Mit all their energies to snake it a slnve State 1 1
Tne whole scheme was " conceived m sin and >
brought forth in iniquity;" it was reared and imr-
Uned m falsehood, violence, and fraud, and it has ,
been baptized in innocent blood, until now it is 1
attempted to be crowned by this Lecompton con- j
f-titmion, which is only the concluding au 111 this j
a rent drama of outrage and wrong upon the rights !
of the people of Kansas and of the free States! !
Sir, when we cease to talk about slavery in con- '
neetion with this Territory, u will be but with :
our Uyu- ! !
But i)efore I sit down, Mr. Chairman, X desire
to advert briefly to one other matter relied upon
by the friends of this measure, to smooth its
passage through this House. It is said, that al-
though this constitution provides the terms of its
own amendment, among which is the provision
that it shall not be interfered with till after 1SG-1,
nevertheless, in defiance of the mode pointed out
in the instrument itself, the people of Kansas may,
at any time, as well before as after the year 18G4,
alter, amend, or abolish it, at their pleasure ' Sir,
1 regard this doctrine as utterly illusory, and as
entirely subversive of those principles of " law
' and order," the championship of which is the pe-
culiar boast of the present Democratic party.
Sir, when this constitution has received the
sanction of Congress, and Kansas is admitted un-
der it, if it has any binding force at all, it is at once
tiie supreme and fundamental law of the new State.
It is, so far as outward forms are concerned, the
h gitimate government: and, like all other gown n-
ments and constitutions, there aie but two mod'-«
by which it ran be reformed—the one throni' ii the
mode provided m the instrument itself; the other,
by revolution.
Mr. Chairman, in all the speeches that have been
made m both 1 louses of Congress m favor of this
measure, the gieat burden of them all, nnd the
gist, of every argument brought forward to sustain
it, amounts to pist tins: that tlx' Lecompton con-
stitution has all tim ins of legality," and that
we cannot £>0 behind these " forms," to inquire
j'nro the actual facts, however much disputed thos^
facts may be. And here we hav<  the snnrniar
xpeetnrie presented, of the same men, who nt one
breath contend tint the constitution is valid and
binding because <01 the " forms" appear to ln\e
been complied with, in the next maintaining lhat
it may fie, at any mom- nt, altei ed, amended, or
absolutely repudiated, and a new one nv.d" m Us
pi a e e, 111 subveision of all 'Mb;ms,"and a^anibt
aU law.
Sir, let me illnstiate this point by a reference to
mv - wn Slate. The peopb. of Nt.-w ifempslnre
have «i ntten eonstitution That constitution ;
piovkb"> the mode by which it may he revised or ■
amenfled Accoidmg to the doctuno sot up here,
however, th" people are not confined {o the mode
of n'visuni 1 >resciibed in the constitution. Hut
how are they to accomplish their purpose outside i
the constiiutir.n J IMirough nn act of the Lrgislu-
ture ? That cannot lie done, for' ach mun is sworn

And ihio is the reason why, by 1 o vote of mine,

IhU, Mr. Chairman, now, as 011 fonvi'T occa- i
sions,the liydra of'di'unnon is dragged m hereto !
help force this measure through Congress. Sir, let '
lifcompton be defeated, and then let the 1< aders 1
of the Democratic party m the southern States i
make the disunion issue on tlie dt feat of it, if they !
d.ue, It will, in that event, not merely he the ,
Democratic party in the North th.u will be shiv-
ered to atoms, but the same party South, on such '
an insane issue; for such a cause would, by the pa- !
t>aotic sentiment of the southern Stales, be driven |
like ch'-.if before the whirUvi.id. ml-urnm, vou -
' you failed. Try it again; and of two things you
may be sure: first, that the Union will notbedis-
■ solved; and second, that whatever party combi-
1 nations may rise on its ruins, the present u Na-
, tional Democratic party" will be known no more
: forever.
I Sir, 1 know not how it may he, but T trust that
on to-morrow this measure 13 to be defeated , and
if it should be, 1 hope that those who make these
threats will attempt to put them into practical op-
eration. That, at least, would piesent an issue
where all true and patriotic men, both of the
North and the South, could stand together; and
the result would be the final overthrow of the fac-
tion which threatens disunion and nullification, if
every mad scheme it invents is not carried out.
3t would result, too, m the complete extinguish-
ment of that sham Democracy, which, being the
firm And steadfast ally of southern nullification
and disunion, if not put down by the American
people, will finally subvert the liberties of the
country.
SPECIAL KANSAS UOM.VllTTJBE.
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN LETCHER,
OF VIRGINIA,
Int tiie House of Representatives,
March 31,1858.
Tlie [Iou-e lu'ttig 111 the Committee of the Whole on the
-state o! tlie ('tuoii-
IVIr. T-.P/JVLIRtt said:
b Mr. (""iiainmv.v: I do not propose to go into
any general diseus^on of the merits of the Kan-
sas question. My sole object in seeking the floor
is to reply 10 some icmarks made bv three geii-
; tlemen in the ju-ogie^s of this debate, in refer-
b mice to the action of the committee of fifteen, of
' 1 which L was a member. The first gentleman who
p alluded to it was the gentleman from New York,
j | [ Air. ]jL:Nrs*ETf;] the next was tlie gentleman from
■! Michigan, [Mr, Walbridc.e,} both of whom were
1 j members of the committee; and the last was my
j, friend fjom North Carolina, [Mr. Giimer,] in
1: the remarks submitted by him this morning.
1 These gentlemen have undertaken to say that the
majority of the committee wme satisfied of the
fact that these frauds had been committed m the
: Ten 1 tory of Kansas, that great wrongs and great
1 outrages had been perpetiated; and that, knowing
tins tact, the committee determined not to exe-
cute l he order of the II ou.se, but to dodge the in-
structions wlneh had been o!Ven to the committee
at tin- tune of its appointment. So far as I am
concerned, theie is nothing in my action con-
nected wiili that committee which I consider re-
quites any dehm^e, either before my constituents
or before tlie country. I pursued that course
which my own convictions of duty pointed out
as the proper one, and which, under similar cir-
cums'ances, with all the lights now before me, I
would pursue again.
ft)s my [ ut pose to show that the majority of
the committee of fifteen di^chareed their duty
. faithfully, as that duty wa« enjoined upon them
■ by the order of the House It will he recollected
1 lhat, on tlie "2d day of February, the gentleman
.from Illinois, [Mr. HulrisJ whose illness I
. irreatly ie'.{ret, introduced into tins House a res-
olution winch contained ten specifications in the
nature of instt urtions to the committee which he
pi oposed to raise.
J V'lil now call attention to each one of these
mstriH tions, bn ausc I desire to have them im-
pn ?.aed upon tiie minus of such as are present,
nod such as may read my remarks, in order that
the resolution, as 'hen presented, may be con-
trasted with the resolution as it was finally
adopted. On reference to the Journal, it will be
found that the resolution, as originally proposed,
instructed the committee that he then designed to
raise, m the first place—
'•To impure into <■!! the lac^ coimccn-d with the forma-
tion o. -,u-l con amnion, and the law-; if any. under which
