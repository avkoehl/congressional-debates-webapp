Military commanders, I have found from an experience not very limited (and to which the General has been pleased to refer), sometimes sacrifice forms to impending necessities. On the subject of the expenditure of ammunition, the General has not been more solicitous as to its economical use than I have constantly been. Thus far it is well known that the naval batteries are under the exclusive command of the naval officers, and I have had only to assist in locating them, to furnish the men and most of the materials to build them, and (when erected) to man and protect them at all times, much to the prejudice of my volunteer organization, and have never ordered the firing of a single gun from one of them.

I have reason to regret that the General should have, apparently, judged as to the character of our operations from information possibly derived from irresponsible. I trust that the General will believe that so far as depends upon myself personally, I shall make the best use of such force and material as may be furnished me and as I can raise and collect.

It is to be observed that, although our forces have not suffered, I should not be willing, trusting to rumor and observation, to assure the enemy so readily for loss sustained.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Colonel, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.
