APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 1838.
25th Cong *"2nd Sess.
Indej endent Treasury~~Mr. Rives.
Senate.
before men loned, some paper medium of highet character,
and other th 11 what now exist  in pnvate bills of exchange, or
notes of Sl'tio banks, no doubt exists that any benefits which
may occasionally be derived fiom its employment can be reach
ly -toured, without treading on the debateable ground of either
Hit, power or the policy of chartering a National Bank Certi-
ficates, not on interest, but payable m specie to bearer or order,
as well as being receivable for all public dues, could be autho-
rized to be given in payment to the public creditor, whenever
prefered by him, and sufficient specie existed in the Trea
sury Thi = kind of paper would be very convenient m form,
and would differ little from the drafts now m use on banks,
except being diawn on a known specie fund, and exprés ng on
its face not only this, but its being receivable, m the fir&t in
stance for ail pubhr dues It would possess the highest credit
attainable m society" %,The common drafts of this Depart
ment, m the piesent convenient form, possess one advantage,
•which could be imparted to the cemhcates When used at
places against which the balance of trade exists, but draw non
places in vho«e favor it is, the former da now, and may here
after, not only facilitate essentially the domestic exchanges,
but, it the same time, supersede numerous bank transfers,
and the more expensive transportation of specie itself *'
" Tne Mint ceuificates, heietofore given on the deposite of
bullion and specie for coinage, might be easily made 1 unning
to bearer or order, and receivable for all public dues, and, m
that way, would contribute to the same desirable ends "
"It mu¡ t be obvious that the paper of any bank would be less
safe and useful m being received for public dues, m proportion
as it may want sUch solid securities and foundations as the cer
tifica'es belore described "
My purpose is not now to discuss the supposed advantages
of th s Government paper currency, so much lauded by thr Se
cietary Thegteat lecommendaüon of it, m his ey^s, is that
it wouldrest upon a specie basis coextensive with the i&siits
But as the certificates would be rarely returned for redemption
nothing would be more likely to happen than what occuned
m the case of the Bank of Amsterdam that, in the mean time,
large portions of the spene would be withdrawn anddiveited to
other puiposes Bui " intention was simply to'how thit an
losueof a Goveinn t              i cnr ency, in some form or other,
ia one of the m ufi oj           i ui    new financial scheme    In
looking a the ¡ a ■= c jí^j „ed, and otheis of similar ím
port in the lepoi  o+            L        * of the Treasury, itisimpos
•MÜleto wmk soh *j<~    u             ihat the design is to supply a
paper medium, t'uru                  ^1 operations of this Govt in
ment, which, it i„ lopi      %          ultimately cupersede the State
currencies, and the oig„n Au i pioposed in this bill is the in
sti ument by whidi Jut le u ■$ to be accomplished That it
would be a bank rf uncu un unquestionable, and I have
3lread> siownthuit waul J i ^ k bank both of discount and
daposite
The Secretary oi tne uta ay, however, seems tu think
th/re would be no 7? ml m all this, because 'here would be no
znc o i potation But ir un por? ion Is not necessary to cons 1
tute a Lank, whrh den* e¡> its cl atacter wholly from the nature
of its business and function i lie Government bank of Russia
is not incorporated, neuhei is the Government bank of Austria
They are both constituted of and managed by officers of the
Government, precisely as the machinery created by this bjll is
proposed to be managed and duected So in regaid to the pn
vate and joint stock banks of T><i> i They aie not ineoipo
rated, but nobody ever supposed ium tobe the less banks on
that account Some thirteen ci n c n years a£ro, the cele
bratedMr Ricardo proposed tr^ plan oi "a National Bank" m
fingí nd which, among en r hn £,s, wes to have the exclusive
privilege of ibsuing the whole p p i cu.iency oí the kingdom
It wii to be a Government instituí rn, consisting of fire com
m s^iomrs, re&idmgm London, to be Tppomted by the Cro.vn
and íemovable by Parliament, and tobe assisted by agents and
officers established in the leading country towns The phn of
this bill bears, m some íespects, so close a resemblance to that
of Mr Ricardo, that itisdiihcult to resist the lmpiession that the
one must have buggestedthe other The organization proposed
by Mi Ricaido consisted, like that of this bill, of public officers,
having certain duties and functions assigned to them, connect
ed with the collection and management of the public revenue,
as well as wita tbe issue of a paper currency Noactofmcoi
poration was pioposed or deemed necessary, but he did not, on
that account, the less consider his scheme a "National Bank,"
under which name it was expressly presented to bis coun
try men.
But th°re isanothei authority on this head still more in point
It remounts to the first suggestion ever made in this country of
a Government oi Treasury Bank, lallude of course, to Pie^i
dent Jackson, who, m his firsi, annual me °age to Congress,
(1Ó23) threw out the idea of a Bank, founded on the "credit and
resources of the United States " Th s suggesuon became the
subject of very able and eUboiate examination by the Com
minees on Finance in thi^ ind the other House, by both of
which though e m&istmg ol warm friends of the President, the
bugííestion was repudiated and exploded The Pres dent, m
lug Menage it the commencement of the following session ol
Congress, (December, 1830,) thought proper to recur to the
subject, and to define more precisely what he meant by a Bank
founded on "the credit and resources of the United State? " The
si. heme he then brought forward was identical, m evo y re
spect with that contained in the present b 1!, and yet, v ith the
soldierly frankness wh ch characterized him, he did n t hesi
tate to call it by its propei name—ua Bank of the United
States "   Let us see what he said on that occasion
"In thespmtofcompiomiseand improvement which distin
guished our country and it* institutions, it becomes us to inquire
■whether it be not possible to secure the advantage* afforded by
the present Bank, thiough the agency ofa Bank of the United
¿States, so modified in vs punciplesandstructuieas to obviate
constitutional and other objections It is thought practicable to
organize such a Bank, with the necessary oílicers, as a branch
of the Treasury Department, based on the public and tnditidu*
al deposite11, (without power to make loans or purchase pro
perty > which shall remit the funds of the Goi eminent, ard
the expenses oí which may be paid, if thought advisable, b\ al-
lowing its officers to sell bills of exchange to private mdividu
als, at a moderate premium, &c &c In times of pnthc emer
gency, the capacities of such an instiitttiott might be enlarg-
ed by legislative provisions "
The bank which General Jackson proposed was to be or a-
nized, with the necessary officers, as a branch of the Treasury
Department, to be based on the public and tnditzdual depo
sites, W remit the funds of the Government, and to deal tn
bills of exchange    The organization pitmded by the bill un
der consideran n,iste po^ee^s every one of thesealtributes, and
to perform othei banking functions m add tion, such as the issue
ofpapei, wh'Ch was not then contemplated Yet, while the
former plan was boldly avowed to be a bank, this is dented to
be one Gen Jackson, with all his popularity and energy of
purpose, we? not able to commend his plan to the favor of ibe
country, and even his volonte de fei, (iron will) as it was called
by a foreign representative, on a snemoiable occasion, obeying
thegreat lav* of Republicanism, bent beneath the force ofpublic
opinion, and abandoned the scheme Yet the same scheme is
now re produced, amid the confusion of the times, in an sggra
vated form, but without ti e name
It is a remarkable circumstance, Mr President, that the mo^t
ancient and celebrated bmkmg institutions of Europe have
grown up fiom precisely such beginnings as are contained m
this bill The Bank of Venice, for example the oldest and most
celebrated tank m Europe, commenced as a fiscal institution
The Republic, pres&ed b) it->foieico wars was compelled tore
sort to a forced loan Ii ordn to secure the pajment of the in-
terest on this loan it set apxit certain branches of the public
levenue, and minuted a board of commissioners called the
Chamber of Loans, who *vere ch n-ged with the collection and
management of those branche&of the revenue, and theapphca
tion ol their proceeds to the punctual payment of the interest on
the loan 11 the ti ansae Lion uf tho bu&me*s ronfided to them,
they had occasion sometimes to buy find sell bills of exchange,
as I have«hown the officer  of the Treasury, under the organi
7ati®n oí this bill, would do Havmg frequently surplus iunds
on hand, they began at length to employ then more extensively
m the operation of buying and selling exchange, and under
thispowei actually advanced money onmeicantile paper,or,
in other words became a bank of dn>wunt The eredit and
responsible/ of the institution being estab'inhed, the merchants
of Venice began to make use of it ior the safe Keeping of their
funds, and so it became a baiik oí deposite al&o I mail}, a ere
dit on the books of the institution foi money deposited being
equivalent to cash, payments m the couise oí tiade came to be
made by transfers of these ci edits from one to another, oi by
what are now called checks, which per funned the office, and
preceded die introduction of notesyaxiá to the Chamber of Loans
became also a bank or aicnlalion We see, in this example,
by what natnralanuei^giadations the most celebrated bank-
ing institution mFurope that whiUi he<4 been the model of all
the rest, «new out of the simple Í unci ion of collecting and app'y
mg the public revenue, associating to itself a collateral and m
cidemal action in the commerce and cunency of the country,
all of which functions, I ha e «uown, are to be vested by the
new financial scheme in the orficeis of the Tieasury Depart
ment
The "ame m every material respect, wei e the ousin and pro
grees of the Bank of Geno i which, next to that of Venice, was
the oldest, ami, in it* day, the most acciedited, banking wetitu
tion m Europe in England, too, the mint, at one tiruej in being
made the depository of the funds of individuals, as the Secre
tary of theTreasuiy proposes that our mint and its blanches
should be, became virtually a bank— ' die gieat centre of mo
ney transactions and lemittances for England and foreign na
tions," till Charles I, in iu40, impelled by his necessities, vio
lated the piivale funds deposited there, and "happily," as
Burke says, put an end to both its credit and use as a banking
establishment.
The testimony ofhMoiy, then, as well as the nature of things,
proves that the organization instituted by this bill would work
as a great Government bank—buying and selling exchanges
—undei that foim, at least, discounting mercantile paper, re-
ceiving devosites public and private, and ci?culating a. yy&pei
money of its own Nov., I appeal to every friend of che liber
tiet of his country ?od ask him if he would willingly see «o
form.dabl^a union of the moneved and political power consum
mated in the handb of the Government Vv id he put sopo
tent an engine, an instrument so efiicaciou  of operating on the
hopes and fears of men, of enlisting h « interests, of control
ling then foitunc, into the hands of a department of the Go
vernment alieady armed with a patronage and power of fear
ful extent?
The honoiabl Senafoi from New Yoik, [Mr Wright]in a
portioiof hsiemaiks which seemed to be intended especially
for the benefit of tho^e of ua who are still for employing the
State banks as depoMtoiies, and whon he describes as a very
small fraction, said that the real and only alternative before the
country is the Sub Treasury scheme or a National Bank
Now, sn, unless the ob ervatioas I have made on the practical
operation of the Sub Tieasury of the Sub Preasuiy scheme are
founded m the eio^ c~,t delusion, that^cheme, instead of being
antagoniitical toa Nationü Bank m, m eveiy íespect, identical
with it It would be a National Bank under the \\ or^-t possible
form—a National Bank in the hands of tre Executive, con
trolled and managed exclusively by Executive agents If,
then, the honorable Senatoi will insist upon making up an issue,
to which the gho&t of that thrice slam monster the Bank of the
United Males must be a party, he mu^t mend his pleadings,
according to the iea' btate of the caw. and submit to the countíy
this qne&tion Wi1! you hive a ?ipat Go\prnment Bank in the
handb and Uttdei the contio( of F\ cutive officeis or will you
have an incorporated TSntional Bank designed to be a business
concern and not a political engine* When this issue shall be
presente 1, if, indeed, itevei shall be, let me tell the honoiable
senatoi that theie are these whose opposition to a National
Bank i^ as tine as his, oi that of any other man who would
pause Ion  beioie they would peimtt the terror of any alterna
live to drive them imo the support of a -ch^me like that of the
honorable senator, which they belie\e tobe fraught with <he
most serious dan^ei to the hbcities and certain destruction to
the b^st interests ol their country I shall heieaflei endeavor
to show that the ti ue and only means of averting either an in
corpoii edNationa'Bank or a great Government Bank is to
sustain t Stafe institutions and to employ their agency, with
such m r aborts and securities as experience ma> ha\e
shown +o e her necessary or desirable
I wish hi ever, foi the r ie&ent to p irsue the remaikh which
the honoral c Senator, wuh "so mnrh chani\ " to use his
ovio exprés or^ addie sed to that small bactionof erri*g and
obstinate lit" bren ometurtes >cl ped Conservantes The
name, I bd ^ e si i h is rmt been of their o%\ n choosing, but
gentlemen who an1 \«e1l reíd n the histoiy of pai ie^ ^iii not
lad to remei ei that the i lost od oi s apd reprt a-^híul de^igna-
nationb app dto then bv their advei^ancb have become en
dearpd by tht rjersecutions ot political intolerance and those
who at first felt injurui and insulted by the application of a
political nickname have at last proudly appropriated it, and
come to glory in it as a mcmonal oí their struggles and a eym
bol of their principles Now, air, I do not Jmow that Jxereis
any thing m this name of Conservative, as appled to Amen-
can institutions, which an American patriot ought: to wish to
disown. It implies devotion to the existing institutions of his
country; a desire to preserve and defend them, a willingness,
and even zeal, to reform, as the only effectual njeans ot pre
serving, but an unconquerable resistance to schemes ofwild
innovation and -destruction If this is what is meant fey a
Conservative, (and such is the true and proper import of the
term,) then, sir, I proudly avow myse?f a G&nser-vtaive—d,
Conservative of Republican institutions, of Republican prm
ciples, of Republican practices as illustrated and Interpreted
by the great champions of the Republican faith
But, sir, to pursue the remarks of the honorable -Senator, ad
dressed to this small fraction of his political brethren. He
tells them that their plan, has very few supportersin either
House of Congress, that ther-e" are two great fsarues in Con-
gres$,one foi tbe Sub Tna^ury «cheme, and the other for a
National Barjk; and he sees, tnereiore, no prospect of success
for any middle ground lie then assumes that the state of pub
lie sentimert among the people corresponds to this, division
of opinion in Congress I must say, *i*h all my respect for
the gentleman's knowledge and skill in the statistics of party
that this assumption is not warran'ed uiuW tí e circumstances
of the rase, nor does it seem to me to be sound m principle
If imphes that the organization andarra> of paities here is to
give law to public opinion and that pul he opirion is not to
shape and control tbe action of } artie* here Sir, I go for ¿he
voice of the people, and the people ha\espoken forihemselves
They have not left us to tnfei their sentiments from anyacci
dental or temporary relation of parties here. They have pro
nounced judgment on the gentleman's screrre; and I should
like to know w here the honorable gen Jt ma i finds, in these ex-
pressions ©f public opinion, any ev idetíce d*at there is a gr#at
party m this counliy m favor of the Sib Tieasury project,
rsevei before has any propo^iüon. Leen o signaííy rebuked and
condemned by the \oice of die people I refer to these things,
Mr President, with no pleasure i contributed mybestexer
tionsto the elect on of the p^esimt Chiuf Magistrate, honestly
anticipating from his prudence his abilities, and his j atnotism,
a wite and successful administration ' f the public a^ain* Ño
one has felt a more sincere d-nre 101 his= success than I have
done The unfavorable manifestations of public sen iment,
therefore, upon the first leading measliie of his administration,
(though I foiesaw and foietold them from ti e fir moment that
tha* measure was sua^ested,) have been tome the source of
any thing rathei man pleasure TÍSey ha>e hjw, however, be
come matteis of public history, andas the Sena'oi fiom ?iew
York seems disponed to confne our view here for second hand
proofs of public* opinion on the merits of the different financial
measures which have been proposed, I must f>eg lease to invite
his attention to those xnoie majestic displays of public sentí
ment which have been piesented on tne great theatre of the
nation Let him loot at the elections which have taken place
in the seveial States since this fatal measure was first broached
m the official j jurnal, and say how many of them have even-
tuated m fa^or of the Administration \Vith one or two ex
ceptions, they have all terminated against it, and mainly, there
is leason to believe, on account of this very measure
Where, then, does the honoiable Senator find the evidtnce
that there is any great body of popular sentimtn' in tin country
m favor of his schemed Theevidence is all die other way and
o f the most overwhelming force So as o th" other great alter
native of which the honorable Senator speaks, (a JSational
Bank,) a large majority of the people have repeatedly declaied
against it, and without imputing to them a degree of fickleness,
of which I, at least, do not suspect them, they must siill be op
posed to it What plan, then will Ihey rally to, asa safe and
practical substitute ior the Sub lieasuiv on die one haDd,ora
National Bank on the othei7 It is the emplíymemoí the State
banks institutions intimate]} connected wuh then domestic in-
terests, lesponbible to, and supeiusedlv tneir domestic autho-
uties, (-nd exempt from all danger of political combnatton the
en ploy ment of these institutions ui dtc legula ions which shall,
at the same time, cecine their efficiency an! guard against
abuse Such, I am firml> peiauaderi, would be, at this moment,
the unbiassed decision of a large majorii) of the American peo
pie And even if we appeal to the criterion ^etup by diehono-
lable Senator from New "iork—the slate of parties m Con
gre-s—I think we may deduce from that conclusions far more
favorable to tbe State bank depoMie s\srei i than be has drawn
If there be butasmnll partj mCongie^ v. ith whom tbe State
bank deposite system is a first choice, he mu-t admit that it is
the second choice oí a laige majorifv Tbe &uh Treasury party
would, I piesumc, prefer it .,0 a Nation il Bank, and the National
Bank party n ould prefer it to the >uv Treasury Now, sn the
honorable gentleman will permit me to reiresh his early read*
insi, by reminding him of an mciaei t lelattd bj Plutarch After
the battle of Salami-, in wnich the pou erof tne Ferian monarch
was crushed b> the combined Giecianfieet the different com
manders ol the squadion repaired to the ahai of Neptune, and,
according to a custom of the co intry and tht, times, each one
put on a ticket the names ol tho<=ewho had rpjidei ed the most
important sen ice in the action E\ r> officer put upon his
ticket his own name first, but all put the name of Themistocles
next This has been held, m aij future traecas conclusive

evidence of its merit m being *\w ^teond chuice of both oí the
parties which respectively advocate he Sub Treasury and a

adhere to that system, however &n a 1 tney may appearm the
