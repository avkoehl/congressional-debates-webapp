better than it had been at Fredericksburg. The roads by which the wounded were brought from the front, a distance of about 10 miles, were good and generally level, so that little suffering or exhaustion was caused by the trip. Supplies of every kind wee abundant and readily accessible; ice was freely supplied from ice-houses in the vicinity; soft bread was furnished after the 5th of June, and straw supplied on and after the 7th. No hospital gangrene made its appearance, and very little erysipelas.

When this hospital had become fairly established, and it was apparent that its organization would be somewhat permanent, the magnitude of the interests involved rendered it necessary that special officers should be assigned to duty in it, in charge of the commissary and quartermaster's departments, respectively. The state of the case having been represented to General Meade, an order was issued on the 10th, directing Captain Jones, assistant quartermaster, U. S. Volunteers, and Captain Talbot, assistant commissary of subsistence, U. S. Volunteers, to report to Dr. Dalton for duty connected with their respective departments. They entered upon their duties on the 13th, and their subsequent labors contributed largely to the success and prosperity of the hospital. On the 11th, preparations began for a move. As fast as the tents could be emptied they were taken down, and by the 14th the hospital was packed and ready to move. Each corps organization was kept separate, and had a separate barge allotted to it for its transportation. The depot hospital boats and barges, together with those of the medical purveyor, moved on the 15th, passing first to the vicinity of Jamestown Island, and finally reaching City Point without accident on the evening of the 17th. The depot at White House was not entirely broken up, however, the train of the Cavalry Corps, and rations, forage, ammunition, being retained, guarded by the force under General Abercrombie, until the Cavalry Corps should return from its Gordonsville expedition.
