the scene of action, and after the partial pursuit so entirely exhausted as to have disabled them from any active movement.

The enemy we fought were General Thayer's command, from Fort Smith and Roseville, including parts of thirteen regiments, and comprising 500 or 600 negroes-supposed to be in all 2,500 men. probably 300 of these negroes were killed and 75 white Federals. But few prisoners were brought in by my command, because their work was in the heat of contest and not in pursuit. I carried into action---

Part of the Twenty-ninth was on detached service; also, Captain Hiead's unattached company. A portion of each of the commands still in the Indiana country. One-fourth of those in the field were holding horses and 27 acting as infirmary corps. Without an exception that I know of every officer in my brigade acted gallantly and nearly every man. I exhorted them to coolness and deliberate aim before advancing, and the testimony of their immediate commanders is, that they had never before seen such shooting in action, the men firing as though hunting squirrels. Major Carroll, as usual, exerted himself to do the full duties of a commander. Lieutenant-Colonel Battle was forward in the advance. major Looscan was prompt, active, and gallant. Captain Krumbhaar entirely cool, quick, and importantly useful. Captain Welch's unattached company, their captain being absent, was temporarily under control of Lieutenant-Colonel Battle. To Captain M. L. Bell and Lieutenant S. l. Anderson, of my staff, I am indebted for valuables services promptly rendered.

The killed and wounded of the brigade, as shown by recapitulation rendered heretofore, were as follows, viz: Killed, 3; wounded, 28; missing, 3; total, 34. Of these there were----
