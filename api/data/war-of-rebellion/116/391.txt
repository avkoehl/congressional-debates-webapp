HEADQUARTERS DIVISION,
Baltimore, Md., March 19, 1862.

Captain WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE.

MY DEAR CAPTAIN: Do you keep any record of prisoners exchanged or paroled who come by way of Fort Monroe? I ask this for the following reasons: One Arthur Dawson, a young man of the Home Guard (Confederate) was taken prisoner by Colonel Geary's men early last summer. He was finally sent to Fort Warren. Efforts were made for his exchange and one Beriah Pratt, of Geary's regiment, was brought to Manassas to be exchanged for Dawson, but for some reason was returned to Richmond (about July 10) and from there by boat of truce to Fort Monroe. Pratt did not rejoin his regiment but went to his home in Luzerne County, Pa., and Dawson after waiting at the Point of Rocks to be exchanged with Pratt as had been agreed upon was finally sent to the Old Capitol in Washington where he still remains a prisoner. This much I gather from a letter from his mother (Mrs. Dawson) brought here by a good friend of our cause. If you can assist me I will be much obliged to you.

Yours, truly,

D. T. VAN BUREN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
