Brig. General G. M. DODGE,Comdg. Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps, Corinth, Miss.:

GENERAL: Upon my arrival to-day, I found the following communication from Major-General Hurlbut to Brigadier-General Carr, then in command of the Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:
HEADQUARTERS, Memphis, October 14, 1863.

Brig. General E. A. CARR:

Sweeny's movements have not pleased me. He should have placed his infantry in rear of Chalmers, toward Chulahoma, and cut off his retreat toward Wyatt. As it is Chalmers now has effected retreat on Oxford, to the disgrace of our arms.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

This is a very serious charge to make before General Hurlbut has seen my report, and I therefore request that a court of inquiry be called immediately to investigate the matter thoroughly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
