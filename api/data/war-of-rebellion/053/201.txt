LA GRANGE, October 9, 1863. (Received 10th.)

Major-General HURLBUT:

The cavalry which have returned from the front have exhausted their ammunition, owing to which fact I shall not be able to move upon the enemy until the morning of the 11th October, 1863, when I will move south with what forces I can safely spare from this post. I still keep a force at Davis' Mills, but continue to scout the country to the right and left of me. The enemy are reported finely armed. Colonel Ben. Spooner's brigade is detained here in order that I may move a larger force to the front. No news of importance this evening.

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel BEN. J. SPOONER,

Commanding Second Brigade:

COLONEL: The emergencies of the occasion require the detention of your command at this place for the present. I have sent a dispatch to General Hurlbut in reference to the matter. Please report to these headquarters, as I desire to confer personally with you.

By order of Brig. General T. W. Sweeny:

Colonel EDWARD HATCH,

Assemble your cavalry and with General Sweeny's infantry and artillery move upon the enemy firmly. They will probably break the road somewhere to-night. Report to Generals Sweeny and Carr so as to have perfect co-operation in the movement.

Colonel EDWARD HATCH,

La Grange, Tenn.:

Issue orders for all cavalry to meet you at such place as you appoint. Follow them sharply and strike heavily. The Seventh Kansas is on its way to La Grange. The Third Michigan is coming in from New Albany, having stampeded their reserve under Richardson. The Fifth Ohio not yet in at Corinth. Call upon Carr at Corinth for what you want and move sharply until you drive them on their infantry supports if they have any. Pursue with vigor and break them up thoroughly.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
