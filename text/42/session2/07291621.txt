1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1621
The only time when this Government at-
tempted to subsidize a line of steamers, the
great Collins line, we uot only lost our money,
bat we ruined those whom we undertook to
aid. That has been the history of subsidies
so far as this country is concerned. And, so
far as confidence in my judgment may induce
any man to regard my words, I warn my friends
not to embark here and now this great Gov-
ernment in'any such undertaking, when we
.have two thousand millions of debt- and taxes
more grievous than are upon the necks of any
other people. These burdens, I agree, they
are quite willing for proper purposes to bear,
but 1 say they are not willing to bear those
burdens for the sake of enabling the Govern-
ment to go into commercial speculations, how-
ever roseate their hue or however grand the
conception. It is no part of our business, it
is no part of our duty to go into such things.
TH"e money is not raised from the people or
put into our hands by the law for any snch
purpose. I repeat that it is put into our hands
in trust for a single purpose, and for no other.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I withdraw the
amendment.
Mr. DAWES. I renew it. In continuation
of the remarks I made last Friday, and as
auxiliary to the purpose which I then had, I
lend my feeble voice in support of this prop-
osition. In looking over the means by which
we are to realize the anticipations of the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Brooks] and the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley,]
I know of no such just and proper appropri-
ation of money as that which will open up the
channels of trade, and gather in at the custom-
house of this' country those revenues which
will otherwise go to other nations to enrich
their treasuries and their households and their
people.
No man can stand on the wharf at San Fran-
cisco and see on e of these magnificent steamers
come in with its treasure from the Bast, which
would otherwise go round the other way to
European parts, and then see it going out
bearing the products of the manufactures and
the industry and the enterprise of this country
into those new markets, without being im-
pressed with the great truth that commerce is
not all on one side, that every dollar that we
take to foreign ports comes back to us and
enriches us, that commerce, when sustained,
enriches those who sustain it on one side and
the other.
What has been the result of this trade ?
The one single article of tea brought in for
local consumption at the port of San Fran-
cisco itself, since 1864, amounted to 17,016,-
020 pounds, bringing into the custom-house
at San Francisco SH,240,793.
I invite the attention of the committee to a
detailed statement of imports from China and
Japan.

Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Will my
friend allow me to ask him a question?
Mr. DAWES. Do not interrupt me in a
five-minutes speech. I am in favor not alone
of this class of appropriations, but I am in
favor of a judicious expenditure of money,
even for bounties for fishermen, to build up
and strengthen this country in all its parts
and in all its arms, and in all its enterprises,
whether it be the fishermen of the eastern
coast, or the men who are struggling for com-
merce on the western coast of this country.
Sir, there is, as the gentleman from New
York [Mr. Brooks] has said with great pro-
priety, a mighty struggle upon the Pacific
ocean whether all these treasures_ shall come
through our ports, a large proportion of them
to he distributed among our people in return
for all that we can produce for that market,
and then carried through our country to Euro-
pean ports, or whether they shall go round to
European ports.
Sir, I cannot agree with my honorable friend
from Indiana [Mr. Kerr] that we should make
no roads, construct no harbors, erect no cus-
tom-houses ; that we should expend no dollar
of money that shall contribute to increase the
commerce of this nation; that we should look
to nothing but perfect emancipation, such as
the Indians in their primitive state enjoy, of
all regulations, all rules.,of trade, and of all
laws of commerce and industry. Sir, I can-
not go back to that state and condition of
things, even under the cogent arguments of
my friend from Indiana.
Mr. HOLMAN. Mr. Chairman, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] lec-
tured the House but a day or two since on the
subject of economy, and now he supports this
pioneer subsidy bill, involving the most per-
nicious form of public extravagance, the, end
of which cannot be foreseen. This is a pio-
neer measure. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts well knows that a flood of measures
of this character have been originated, appro-
priating millions of the public money for sub-
sidizing special interests.
Mr. Chairman, I tremble when an influen-
tial corporation comes before this House
demanding money out of the Treasury. The
demand is generally irresistible. But here are
not only the influential gentlemen owning this
Pacific mail steamship line which is to receive
the direct subsidy of $500,000, but two other
great corporations, the Central Pacific Rail-
road Company and the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, whose business this â–  subsidy is in-
tended to enlarge. Here, sir, is a combination
of absolute power, a power created by Con-
gress by its system of subsidies and now used
in demanding more. You have given these
gentlemen $500,000 a year to add to thfe
profits of their business ever since 1866, in
this China trade, and instead of being after
these six years satisfied with the $3,000,000
you have paid them, they demand a sum out
of your Treasury actually exceeding the value
of their entire exports. Their entire exports
are less than a million a year, as shown by the
revenue reports.
The gentleman says, and I am astonished
at the proposition, that by the facilities of
transportation of this Pacific line, sustained
by money drawn from the Treasury, we are
increasing our revenue. Does not the gentle-
man know that the articles of tea and silks to
which he refers can come, aud do come, as
cheaply by way of the Isthmus or around the
Cape or by the Suez canal, as by this Pacific
route, and that just as much of these articles
would come by these other routes as will como
by way of the Pacific ocean and San Francisco
under this subsidy? You do not increase the
revenue at all; you but change the routes for
the importation of the articles on which the
tax is imposed, and the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts knows that. It is not a question
of commerce, but a mere question of the ear-
ryingtrade. The amount of tea consumed and
silks used in this country will be neither more
nor less whether you give or refuse this sub-
sidy. Whether it comes through one channel
or another is a matter of no consequence to
my constituents or to the gentleman's constit-
uents.
Sir, there is no defense for these subsidies.
I see in the early future anew and well-defined
line of division between the political parti.es
of this country, between those who would sub-
sidize special interests and build up princely
fortunes at the expense of the common indus-
try of the whole people, aud those who will
demand that the revenues drawn from the
people by taxation shall be applied for the
legitimate purposes of Government and for no
other purposes ; that labor shall not be taxed
on the specious pretense of public enterprise
when private fortunes and individual aggran-
dizement are the real purpose. That line
of division is being distinctly drawn.
Here is but a purpose to increase and en-
hance the wealth of a favored few, organized
into two or three corporations of ship-carry-
ing and railroad-carrying interests, who are
demanding this half a million annually. This
is the pioneer bill of the series for money sub-
sidies, and upon the vote on this bill the future
policy of gentlemen will be clearly indicated.
This is the least plausible of the subsidies pro-
posed. Gentlemen who are willing to build
up the wealth of a handful of people, who have
the hardihood to ask it, by taxing their con-
stituents and the whole people, aud those who
demand thai their constituents shall bear no
other burdens than the legitimateburdens of
Government, will clearly define their positions
on this vote.
This is the entering wedge, the pioneer of
this system of money subsidies. These adven-
turers who seek to amass fortunes out of other
men's labor have pretty well exhausted your
public lands and now turn upon the Treasury.
