printed.
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
business has concluded, and the bill called up
by the Senator from Oregon is now before the
Senate.
Mr. CORBETT. I ask to have the bill read
as I hare amended it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
not call up the unfinished business until after
the Senator from Oregon has concluded, unless
it is insisted on.
Mr. WRIGHT. While I do not wish to
interfere with the remarks of the Senator from
Oregon in any way, I shall deem it my duty to
insist on the regular order promptly at one
o'clock.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
then call up the unfinished business at one
o' clock.
Mr. CORBETT. I hope the Senator will
not count the time he occupies.
The Secretary read the bill (S. No. 807) to
facilitate specie payments as proposed to be
modified by Mr. Coiiisett, as follows:
Be it enacted, That each national bank now
required to keep its reserve in leg-al-tender notes
shall, on tlio 1st day of July, 1872, have on hand at
least three per cent, in gold coin of its amount of
notJS in circulation; on Lit e 1st day of January, 187>.v,
each of such banks shall have on hand at least six
per cent, in gold coin of its' amount of notes in cir-
culation ; on tnc 1st day of July, 1873, each of such*
banks shall have on hand at least nine per cent,
in gold coin of its amount of notes in circulation; on
the 1st day of J anuary, 1874, each of such banks shall
have on hand at least twelve per cent, in gold coin
of its amount of notes in circulation; on the 1st day
of July, 1874, each of such banks shall have on hand
not less than fifteen per cent, in gold coin of its
amount of notes in circulation, and thereafter each
of said banks shall keep its reserve in gold coin in-
stead of legal tender notes upon the amount of notes
in ciiculation : Provided, That said re&erve shall at
all times be kept on hand in each bank subject to
use at its counter.
Mr. CORBETT. Mr. President,, this is a
bill which in my opinion is very important
for us to adopt in order that we may take one
step at least toward specie payment. I believe
that we have all desired this, but I wish to
show that we have not made very great pro-
gress since the close of the war toward that
much-desired condition.
The amount of our imports during the last
year of the war (1865) was $238,745,580.
Now we have an import of $533,000,000. A
statement I have had prepared shows that in
1866 we had in the national banks and the
Treasury of the United States $94,009,201 51
iu gold. We had at the close of the year 1871,
on an average, in the banks of the country
and in the Treasury of the United States,
$150,112,043 45 in gold. I herewith em-
body this statement in detail.
Amount of specie in the United Slates Treasury and in the national banks at the following
periods.

* December 31.
It will be observed not quite as much specie
in proportion to the amount of imports as wo
had in 1865. Consequently it shows that the
only specie which is used now is used for the
purpose of paying for imports, and we have
only increased the specie according to our
actual wants for that purpose, and if we ever
intend to return to specie payments we must
distribute this gold throughout the country,
and for the purpose of making this distribu-
tion through the country I have introduced
this bill, so as to compel not only the banks in
the cities, but the banks throughout the coun-
try to keep their reserve in gold upon their
circulation that is issued to them ; not, upon all
their deposits in addition thereto, but simply
upon the amount of circulation that they have
been allowed according to law.
This is as mild a provision as can possibly
be prescribed and extends over the time of
two and one half years. Consequently there
can be no objection by the banks to requiring
them simply to keep the specie that is paid
them upon their bonds by the Government and
to hold it in reserve, so that at the close of two
and a half years we may have distributed
throughout the country this fifteen per cent,
in the country banks and twenty-five per cent,
in the city banks, thereby making an average
of eighteen and three fourths per cent, upon
the aggregate circulation of the banks of the
United States.
The question is, when shall we commence
to take this step? I introduced a bill some
three or four years ago for this purpose. We
have adopted no measure looking to specie
payment. I believe it is incumbent upon this
Administration that we should take some steps
in this direction. We have had an unusual
degree of prosperity since the war, and the
banks have all participated in this prosperity,
and it is no hardship to them to compel them
to keep their reserve on their circulation in
gold.
Mr. President, I have statistics here to
show the amount of specie in the banks in
the redemption cities and also in the country
banks, and I desire to call the special atten-
tion of the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate to this statement. In the city of New
York in 1871 the average circulation of the
banks was $31,586,335. The average specie
held by these banks in that year was $13,-
252,231, or 41^ per cent, of their circulation.
This was therefore largely in excess of the
twenty-five per cent, that they would be re-
quired to hold according to law if this bill
should pass. If this bill should become a law
they would only be required to keep on hand
$7,896,581. All the banks in the other re-
demption cities—Boston, Albany, Philadel-
phia, Pittsburg, Baltimore, Washington, New
Orleans, Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee—
had an average circulation of $71,595,170,
specie only to the amount of $2,781,414, or
3^j per cent, while they would be required to
hold by this bill twenty-five per cent. There-
fore, they would be required to hold $17,-
898,792. The other banks of the United States
not in cities of redemption had a circulation
on the average, in 1871, of $204,494,697,
and the whole amount of specie held by
those banks was $2,226,413, or only 1^ per
cent,. They would be required to hold hl'teen
per cent, by this bill. Consequently they
would have to hold at the end of the two and
a half years $30,674,201. Now, the whole
amount of specie under this hill would average
18:f percent, on all the bank circulation, and
would amount to $56,517,094, whereas they
only hold now $18,612,251. I will annex the
table carefully prepared:

I desire also to show that these banks at
various times, immediately after the payment
ol interest, held largely in excess of this
amount, and they simply dispose of this gold
