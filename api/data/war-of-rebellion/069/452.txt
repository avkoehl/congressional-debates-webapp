I have not yet got him back. All this time the firing should have quided him at least. He is too incompetent, and too high rank leaves no subordinate place for him. I earnestly beg that the may be at once relieved from duty with this army. Major Roebling has not yet returned.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 1, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Wright and Smith will renew the attack to-morrow, so soon as Hancock gets up in supporting distance. Hancock will also attack. I desire you should join in this attack with all your available force, and have directed General Burnside to hold his command ready to re-enforce you if required. I suppose it will be 6 or 7 o'clock before Hancock can get up. If we can strike a concerted and vigorous blow to-morrow, it may most materially affect our position. Ricketts carried Longsteet's rifle-pits this evening, taking over 500 prisoners.

An order will be sent in the morning relieving Brigadier-General Lockwood from command. You can now make a good division for Crawford.
