that selections of the best mounted men from the different commands be made for the purpose. In such service as the troops are called upon to perform in a raid or in covering a retreat, every man who is dismounted by his horse giving out falls into the hands of the enemy and swells the list of our losses. They very best horses should, therefore, be used on this service.

Should a raid be contemplated at this time in the direction of James River or Lynchburg, a strong diversion in its favor should be made by an attack of the enemy in force, or a demonstration to his opposite flank, for he is watching us closely; his cavalry force at this time is considered as large-and by some of the division commanders larger-than ours, and no raid could succeed if attacked and compelled to fight at its outset.

To prepare and start a raiding party after a general action has commanded, and when the enemy's attention is diverted, would be much more favorable for its success.

I am, very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
