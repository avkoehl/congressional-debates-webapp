Scout from my front arrived. He reports 600 cavalry from Bragg moving through Northern Alabama. Their destination is reported to be Okolona; they are moving in that direction. Bragg's forces are stationed from Knoxville to Bridgeport; appear to be scattered promiscuously along the railroad. Could not ascertain where the main corps was.
