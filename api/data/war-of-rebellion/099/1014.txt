not send any cavalry here; there is no necessity for it. Keep communication open by way of Broxton's Bridge. The enemy have a bridge at Port Royal Ferry.

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

You will please confer with Commodore Tucker as to present employment of the naval force at Charleston. I have this day sent a suggestion to him in that connection.

RICHMOND, VA., January 15, 1865.

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Yours of yesterday received. * I hope General Butler's division of cavalry will soon be with you. Have nothing from General Beauregard which enables me to say when or with what force he will reach you. I have called on the governor of Georgia, invoking his aid to sustain you in holding the line of the Combahee as better for defense than any you can take in the rear of it. I hope you will be able to check the advance of the enemy, and to be re-enforced before he can construct works to operate against your position.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., January 15, 1865.

Commodore TUCKER,

Commanding, Afloat, Charleston, S. C.:

The movements of Sherman render it important that you should, if practicable, attack the enemy's force off the harbor. I trust that you can do so, and, if successful, that you may be able to destroy his depot at Hilton Head and render the most valuable aid to General Hardee.

January 15, 1865.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The movements of the enemy indicate a serious advance either up the Salkehatchie, by which, crossing the river at Broxton's Bridge or higher up, they will reach the railroad at Midway, or some other point between Augusta and Branchville, or, by forcing a passage near the railroad bridge over the Salkehatchie, they will be able either to advance directly on Charleston or on Branchville. It is important that you should send a force at once to Broxton's Bridge to watch the enemy and to oppose his progress. I have not been able to obtain any information to-day respecting the movements of the enemy which is satisfactory. I have re-enforced McLaws at this point and have ordered
