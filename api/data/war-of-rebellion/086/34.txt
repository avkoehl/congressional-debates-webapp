Very respectfully,

JOHN M. THAYER,

P. S.-I have no news from the enemy.

MEMPHIS, TENN., October 17, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

GENERAL: Dispatches received from Generals Washburn and Thomas, also information received through reliable scouts, shows that Forrest is about to attack Memphis in heavy force. There are only about 5,000 effective men here, including the Enrolled Militia. Can you spare any of the troops sent to you from here, even for a short time? Two thousand men sent at once may save the city of Memphis, and the amount of Government property here is so vast that the most strenuous efforts should be made to save it.

MORGAN L. SMITH,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
