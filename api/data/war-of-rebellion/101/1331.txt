Fort Smith being either evacuated or left with a small garrison. I think also that his veteran infantry are being sent down the Mississippi River, and that he proposes an invasion with his cavalry into Northern Texas, either by this route or the Line road. the remainder of Shelby's cavalry cannot consequently be safely sent farther than Red River, Titus, or Upshur Counties. I inclose you a letter from General Shelby, complaining that the officer at Clarksville refused to issue supplies to his troops. In view of the facts that the corn, fodder, and other supplies in Sevier County, Ark., have been used by troops not belonging to this district, and also that a large quantity of subsistence stores, which had been accumulated at Laynesport for the use of General Price's army, was taken an consumed by Gano's command, and which, if they had not been taken, would have been ample to supply Shelby for a considerable time, I would respectfully ask that these officers be instructed to issue to General Shelby's command such supplies as may be required. I have no engineer to place in charge of the works on Red River. Captain Mackey, Engineer Corps, is here, and as he is thoroughly acquainted with the country, I desire that he should be retained here to take charge of this work.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Washington, January 15, 1865.

Major General T. J. CHURCHILL,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you distribute the recruits of your command at once to the different companies. You will arm them and make them ready with ammunition and equipments, as far as you can, for the field at once. Hold three brigades in readiness to march at a moment's warning to Dooley's Ferry and Fulton, each bringing all their axes, spades, &amp;c., for working upon fortifications.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Washington, January 15, 1865.

Major General, J. F. FAGAN,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that your order General Shelby to hold his command in hand to advance by way of Fulton, get ammunition there, and proceed to the front via Washington to meet the enemy. If he hears of the enemy via the Line road he will cross at Laynesport, if possible. The ammunition is at Fulton, say 90,000 rounds of all kinds. It must be sent at once to Shelby by empty wagons returning to Clarksville. You will get ammunition for Clark's and Cabell's brigades from Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, ordnance officer of this district. A battery for each division of cavalry will be turned over ready for service with appropriate ammunition at once by Major Magruder, chief of artillery.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. M. KIMMEL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
