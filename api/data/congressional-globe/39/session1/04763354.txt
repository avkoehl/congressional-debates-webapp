PENSIONS TO SOLDIERS OF 1812.
Mr. PERHAM. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Invalid Pensions to report adversely
upon House bill No. 168, granting pensions to
soldiers of the war of 1812 with Great Britain.
The SPEAKER. "The question is, Shall
the bill be laid on the table ?
Mr. MILLER. I move that the bill be re-
committed, with instructions to the committee
to report it with a recommendation that it pass.
Mr. SPALDING. I hope this motion will
be adopted.
Mr. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, on the 22d
of January last I presented to this House the
bill now under consideration, entitled "A bill
granting pensions to soldiers of the war of 1812
with Great Britain," and asked that it be re-
ferred to a select committee, in order that
speedy action might be had thereon ; but the
honorable gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Wash-
burns] interposed an objection and had it re-
ferred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions,
and the result is, at this late day, a verbal re-
port with a negative recommendation. This
extraordinary report, it seems to me, can only
be accounted for on the ground that the ardu-
ous duties of that honorable committee pre-
vented them from giving the subject-matter
due consideration, for no written report has
been presented, and I cannot well see how one
could be, resting upon a sound basis, embra-
cing such a recommendation. The bill, Mr.
Speaker, provides that the surviving commis-
sioned and non-commissioned officers, musi-
cians, and privates of the Army and Navy of
the war of 1812 with Great Britain, who have
received an honorable discharge and are now
in necessitous circumstances, and the widows
of such as are deceased who are in like circum-
stances, shall have their names placed on the
pension-list of the United States, and be paid,
out of any money in the Treasury not other-
wise appropriated, the sum of eight dollars per
month, to be computed from the 1st day of
April, 1865. The sum proposed to be paid
by this bill is very small, and confined exclu-
sively to those in indigent circumstances.
A bill passed this House during the first ses-
sion of the Thirty-Fifth Congress by a majority
of fifty-five, giving pensions to the soldiers of
the war of 1812 without confining it to those in
"necessitous circumstances," and among the
honorable gentlemen that are members of the
present Congress who voted for that bill, I
find the names of Messrs. Thayeu, Bingham,
and our distinguished Speaker, [Mr. Colfax.]
That bill seems, for some cause, perhaps for
want of time, not to have been taken up in the
Senate. Trouble was then about coming upon
the country, and our old heroes were willing to
let their claim rest for a time ; but as the dark
cloud that was hovering over our country is
now dispelled they renew their request, and
call upon this Congress to give a pittance to
enable them to procure a little food and rai-
ment in their old age and declining years.
After the space of thirty-five years from the
treaty of peace by which our independence was
recognized the soldiers of that war were placed
on the pension-roll, only two of whom survive,
to wit, Samuel Dowling, of New Hampshire,
and James Barnham, of Missouri. A few years
more and these two veterans will also be taken
from us, and none will be left to relate the
doings of those dark days; but their works will
live. And now that more than fifty years have
passed since the war of 1812, sometimes de-
nominated the second war for independence,
was ended, justice requires that the names or
the surviving veterans of that war should be
placed on the roll of pensions, so that speedy
relief may be had to alleviate those that are in
indigent circumstances.
These old veterans have passed their three-
score years and ten, and yet they are brave.
I remember, Mr. Speaker, of being at Harris-
burg at the time General Lee invaded Penn-
sylvania with a large rebel army, and seeing
some of these old soldiers crossing the bridge
over the Susquehanna at double-quick, with
their rifles on their shoulders, ready and willing
to face the enemy. They will not honor the
nation with their presence much longer. They
are rapidly passing away, many having left
us since I had the honor of presenting this bill,
and if Congress intends to do anything for these
old heroes, action ought to be taken immedi-
ately. I will read, Mr. Speaker, a circular
addressed to the members of Congress by a
committee appointed on the 18th of February,
1858, at a meeting of the Veteran corps of the
city of New York, which is as follows:
At a meeting of the Vetera corps of the city of
New York, held on the 18th day of February, 1858, it
was
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to address
a letter to each member of Congress, asking their
support of a bill to provide for the militia who were
enrolled in actual service during the last war with
Great Britain, and to forward the same without de-
lay; and that Henry Raymond, James B. Murray,
William liuttree, I. M. Phyfe, Thomas D.Howe, John
C. Howard. Daniel Whitney. Henry Baker, Harlow
Porter, Charles IC, Crowley, and William (#. Monell
compose said committee.
