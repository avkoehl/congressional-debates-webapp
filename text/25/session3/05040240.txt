Abolition Petitions—Mr. Moore.

then
If the citizens of this District may have one
species of property wrested from them by the
high hand of power, what security have they
that their property, of whatsoever kind, will not
share a similar fate' But this supposition can-
not be tolerated for a moment The doctrine
strikes at the veiy root of all fiee government,
and is, to all intents and purposes, subversive of
the social compact. In the language of the Su-
preme Court—
"There are acts which the Teieralor State Legislatures
ctnuiat do without exceeding their authority Ihere are
certain vital principles in oui free, republican Government,
which will determine and overrule an apparent and flagrant
abuse of legislative power, as to authorize manifest in
justice by positive law, or to take away tint security for
personal kberty or private property, tor ibe protection
whereof the Government was established An act of the
Legislature contrary to the great, first principles of the
social compact, cannot be Considered a rightful exercise of
legislative authority Tbe obligation of a law, in govern
merits established on express compact and on republican
principles, must be determined by the nature of the power
on which it is founded A few instances will sufiice to
efplntn A law tint punished a citizen for an innocent
action or that was in violation oí an exiting \tw , i law
that destroys or impairs the obligation ol ilie lawful ptiv ite
coutneu ol citizens i law that makes a man a jii Il.( in
his own case, or aliw that tikes propirti from A ind
gives it toll J lis against all ieison ami justice lor a people
to intrust a Legislature With such powirs, and thereloie it
cannot be presumed that tin V hive done it The Leerla
ture may enjoin or permit loibid or punish, they m ij de
c! ire nt w crimes, and tst iblisii nib s ot conduct for luluie
cases, but thty cannot chance innocence into guilt, or
punish iimocencp as a crime, or viólalo the n^liis ol an
antecedent lawlul privau contiiet, or the rights of pmate
piopcrly l o maintain that our X cd( ral or Slite Lc„isl i
lures possess sucli powers evt n if they bid not been 11
pre^sly restrained nould be a political heresy altogether
inadmissible m our free, republican Goicrnmcnt "
The principles here affirmed by the Supreme
Court are unquestionably sound, and thty apply
its well to the citizens of this District as to those
of the States Congress, tin rcfoie, can do no
fictaflccting the rights of piopeitym the Dis-
'rict, that they are prohibited lo (loin the States
Willi what propriety, then, can it be coniended
that Congress uie bound to lecene petitions on a
subject upon which thty have no constitutional
right to act' Supposi individuals should pi tin in
Congress to pass a " law K spcctmgnn cstiblish-
ment of h ligion, oi pioliibiting th< fiee c\i rose

or of tlu prtss," would it, 01 could it In rcgaidid

petitions' No sain man will so
because the p( titioncia would, in i fleet, re
to rqect such
aver
quire Congress to violate the Constitution
And
would  it not he equally a violation of the Con
stiuilion for Congiess  to pass an act depriving
individuals of tin u property without " due pin
cess of law"  or to  take  "private propeity"
without "just compensation'"    Most unques
tionably it would     Let us considei, then, lot a
rnoini nt, the nature of the di mand made upon us
by the Abolitionists, and let us see whether that
demand be in accoidance with then  stuidy pie
tensions to piety and  patnotism or not'    They
petition, besiege, and implóle  us—to do what'
Why, sir, to repudiate the pnneiples of the Ted
eral compact    to violate the  national faith,  to
violate the rights of pnvate pioperty, to tiample
upon the Constitution which we have sworn to
support, and consequently to pollute a id blacken
our souls with the terrific cume of-pcijury ' Yes,
su, all this do the Abolitionists íequite at oui
hands, when they ask us to abolish sla\ery—" as
a great moral evil"—in the Distuct of Columbia
But this is not all The Abolitionists design to
cfTect the abolition of slavery in the States also,
and it is worse than idle—it is dishonest and in
solently hypocritical m them to pretend that their
schemes and efforts are limited to the District of
ColumbiaandtheTeiritones Everybody knows,
and many of the Abolitionists themselves confess
that such is not the fact It is as much then in-
tention to accomplish the abolition of slavery in
the States as in the Territories 01 in this District
Such being the case, then, let us examine, for a
moment, the nature and tendency of the abolition
movement It will be acknowledged by all that,
prior to the organization of the Fedeial Govern
ment, the States weie, m all respects, and to all
intents and puiposes, sovereign and independent
States or nations, and, a3 such, no one State, of
course, could interfere with the lights or internal
police of another State, without a violation of in-
ternational law An attempt, therefore, on the
part of Massachusetts, for instance, to abolish
slavery in Georgia, would have been tiuly and
properly regaided by Georgia as an aggression
upon hei national rights, an assault upon her
State sovereignty, and as a vlitual denial of her
independency as a State or nation What would
have been true then, would be equally true now
Any interference on the part of Massachusetts
with the subject of slavery in Georgia, is as cleai ly
wrong—as much an mftaction of mtei national
law—since the foimation of the Federal Govern-
ment, as it would have been prior to that event
The States, under the Constitution are as essen-
tially and as absolutely sovereign — wheie their
sovereignty is not limited by the Constitution—
as they were before the formation of the Consti-
tution And as slavery exists in the States—not
by virtue of the Constitution, but by virtue of
Slate sovereignty alone—it necessanly follows that
it is without and beyond the power of the Federal
Government to abolish it Congress have no
more right to mteifeie with the institution of sla
veiy in the States than they have to mteifeie with
the lutein il institutions of a foieign Powei The
powei to abolish slaveiy in the States never having
been delegated to Congiess, cannot be exercised
iii/Congiess without a violation of the Federal
Constitution On the subject of slavery, the
States aie not only independent of caehothei, but
also of the Gem lal Government The States
having íesiived to themselves all the rights of
soveieiguty, not dnectly and explicitly conceded
to the Fedeial Government, they are just as free
to exercise those íesuved lights as if such Gov
oinment had never been established This pi op
osition I hold to be self evident The right to
hold slaves not having been ceded to the Gtneial
Government, but retained by tlu States, it fol
lows that an attempt on the part of the citizens
of the non slavt holding States, or of Congiess,
to mteifeie with the institution of sliveiy in any
of the slavelioldmg Siatesi, would be a violation
of the lights of sovc icign and indepi ndf nt Stutis
oi nations, and, of consequence, in rj net t and
positive contiuvemion ol nit in itional law
1 lie Abolitionists, bv waning against the
lights and soviicignly ol the Slat s, eneoui ige a
violation of the n itioiml faith, saneiion theinfiac
Hon of law, and endttiigi i the stability and mug
nty of the Ft dual Union "In taking this
giotind, ' to adopt the la iguige of one of the most
ouginal thinkeis and emrgetic wuttis of the
a_'i ,* "they (the Abolitionists) set the law at
dt fiance, and ait eithei a mob oi a band of insui
itctiomsts In taking this ground, the y justify
all the lawless violence against which they have
so vehemently declaimed If one class of tin
community may set the laws at defiance, why
mty not another' If the Abolitionists, may set
at nought the inli inatioial law, which gives the
slavi holding States the exclusive lunsdiction of
the slave question, why may not othei citizens
say thoy hive a light, by mob law, to previ nt
them, it they can, fiom doing it It weie not
difhcult to convict the Abolitionists of pleaching
the very doctnnes the mobociats attempt to le
duce to piactice They ought not, tbeicfoie, to
think it strange that they have been but in too
many instances the victims of lawless violence
When a poition of the community take it into
their heads that they aie wisei than th< law , and
commence the perfoimance of acts in contiaven-
tion of law, they ought to be awaie that they
open the dooi to evei y species of lawless violence,
unchain the tigei, and must be answerable foi the
consequences "
What must be the certain and inevitable tend
ency of the abolition movement, and what its
moial and politics.! íesults, if its prognss shall
beonwaidanditsmarchbe throughout the Union'
The consequences, alas ' must be but too apparent
and appalling to all leflecting men—to all who
prize the Union—all who lo\e Amenca The
effoits of the Abolitionists, whether triumphant
or not, cannot fail to rock the battlements, if not

view
rive the foundations of the Republic In the
name of Liberty, they seek to ovei throw her last
fortress—the American Constitution In the
name of patriotism, they strive to revolutionize
and upioot the very foundations of our Federal
system And in the name of humanity, they
would tear down the pi op and pillai of the last
fond hope of human kind—the sovereignty of these
United States' Such is the political chaiacter and
tendency of the abolition movement But this is
not all There are fearful moral euls involved in
the designs of the Abolitionists—the violation of
law and of plighted faith Nay, moie allied to
abolitionism is blind, reckless, fevensh fanati-
cism The wild, enthusiastic, and impetuous
spmt which kindled the fires of Smithfield, and
strewed the plains of Palestine with the coises of
the Crusaders, stands, with lighted and uplifted
torch, haid by the side of abolitionism, ready to
spread conflagration and death around the land
But to return to the subject of slaveiy, and of
the right of petition as íelates to the District
The question will be asked, no doubt, if the citi-
zens of the States have no legitimate light to pe-
tition Congiess on the subject of slaveiy in the
Distuct of Columbia, and if Congress aie not
bound to receive such petitions, why is it that so
many thousands have signed petitions of this
chaiacter' The íeason is obvious, sir The
pnme movers in abolition pioceedings, and the
great body of the intelligent signers to abolition
petitions, belong to the Fedeial school in politics,
rheyaie consolidatiomsts, and repudiate the doc-
trine of State lights They regaid the powers
of the Fedeial Government asomnipoteot Hence
they believe the Federal Legislatuie not only
have the powei to abolish slavery in the District
of Columbia, but also in the States The Fedi
eial oi national bank party can believe nothing
shoit of this Sn, this whole abolition move-
ment had its origin in a Fed.ial heresy Aboli-
tionism is the ventable oiTspung of Federalism
It looks to centralization foi the icalization of its
hopes, and the consummation of its pui poses
Withdiaw fiom abolitionism the sustaining aim
of us paunt Fedoialism, and it inevitably be-
com s helpless, and in despun falls piostiate in
the dust In confnmation of what I have just
stated, I would appeal to facts—notorious, unde
ninble, mcontioveitible facts 1 would appeal to
tin known and acknowledged principles of the
Tid ml paity I would appeal to the Journals
of Congress—to the recoided votes of the mem-
beis of this House on all test questions touching
the subject of abolition I would appeal to the
histoiy of the recent elections, and especially to
tin election in the ¡state of New Yoik, where it
is will kinwn every Abolitionist and fiee negro
voied the Fedual or Whig ticket Nay, more
I would appesl to the ten thousand abolition peti-
tions with which this Hall has been flooded foi
the last foul years I will hazard the declaia-
tion, and chalk nge and defy successful contiadic-
tion, thatsmongthe bundled thousand individuals
tint have signed pi titions praying foi the aboli-
tion of slaveiy in the District of Columbia, theie
aie not one bundled whoaie known to be friendly
to the piesent Administration Who will, who
can, who date deny the truth of this assertion '
if the Fedeial Legislature have power, under
the  Constitution, to  " abudge the  fieedom of
f speech, 01 of the press,'' as has not only been con-
| tended for, but the exercise of such powei actu-
ally sanctioned by the Federil party m the time
oi the elder Adams, and if they may charter a
national bank, as is also contended, and delegate
to such bank oi coipoiation the power of legisla

banks and other directors, within any of the States
or Terntoues of this Union, in defiance of the
I wishes and in contiavention of the Kws of such
States 01 Teintones,* why, I would ask, should
they not also claim the power to abolish slaveiy,
not only in the Distuct of Columbia, but also ni
the States ' To contend that Congress have the
constitutional powei to do the fiist named acts,
and not the lattei, would be sheer and gratuitous
nonsense I repeat, theiefore, that the only hope
of the Abolitionists is in. the ultimate triumph of
