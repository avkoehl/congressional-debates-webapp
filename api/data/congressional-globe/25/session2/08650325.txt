2¿th Cong-•••2nd Sess.
Noi thcastern Boundary—Mr. Williams.
Senate.
dence of their title have been embodied m reports
andresoluti in wnich were forwarded to Congress,
and the aid of tht General Government urgently
requested to bring about the settlement and esta-
blishment of the line of boundary. More recently,
and since the commencement of the present session
of Congress, (very soon after the rece pt of the last
communication from the British Government upon
the boundary question,) the President caused to be
sent to the Governor of Mame a statement of
the correspondence vt hich had been had between
the Governments of the United States and Great
Britain upon die «subject of the boundary, since the
rejection of the opinion of the arbiter m 1833, wjth
a request that he would adopt such measures as he
might deem n-eessary to ascertain the sense of the
State of Mame with respect to the expediency of
attempting to establish a conventional line, as well
as to additional surveys and explorations with a
view to the sitisfactor} adjustment of the contro-
versy according to the terms of the treaty, or ena-
bling the part es to decide more understanding^
upon the expediency of opening a negotiation *or a
line that would «uit their mutual convenience, &c
The message of the Governor communicating that
statement to the Legislature, and the resolutions of
the Legislature thereupo i, which I had the honor a
few dajs a'jo to present to the Senate, have been
printed, and are in the hands of Senitois Th«y
are a full, unequ vocal, and direct response to the
questions propounded, and speak the language and
determination, not of a partv, or of a mere majori-
ty, but of the v hole Legislature and people of
Mame This, sir, is no  )?itv question in Mame
The whole people oí mat State feel that they are in-
jured, and that t' eir appeals to the General Go-
vernment for the irotect oi and guirantee of lhnr
rights, wlreh th°y believe the Constitution of the
United States was designed to afford them, have al-
ready been too long disregarded, and they now
hope and trust that Congress will adopt such mea-
sure's as will insure the runmnar and marking of
the boundary line between that State and a foreign
Government, accoi ding to the terms of the treaty.
Such measures are not intended by Mame, and
ought not to b- regarded by others, as hostile, but
as means, and pronably the only means, of settling
the question of boundary far many jears jet to
come Theblivvhoh I propose to submit and
urge the passage of, m conformty wth the resolu-
tions of my Sute, proudes that the President shall
cause the boundary ¡me to be run aid maiKed
agreeably to the provisions ot the tieaty of peace
of J 783 The time foi executing this «eivice, and
the rsanuer of doing it, s left entirely to the discre-
tion of the Pres dent, and it is believ ed that it mav
be done without giving just cause of offence to
Great Bntpm What other mode of running this
line of boundary can be pUisued when it is con-
sidered that our Government has íepeatedly pro
posed to the Government of Great Butam mutual-
ly to appoint sun e^ors or commissioner*1 to run
and mark the line accoi dins; to the treaty and th?t
those proposit ons have been deebned on the pre-
tence that the de=ei íption of the line in the treatv is
io imperfect tbit it is impracticab'e to rim that line
so as to confoim to the terms of the treaty, and that
the British Goveminent still Teiuses to assent n
such a snriey an 1 running of the line wiles* tus
Government v ill a%i ec to such pi ehmincnes as iroul I
change, 01 lender mpiuct cable,'!!" swiey of the I ne
of the treaty
It will be seen by reference to the correspondence
between thi« Government and that of Great Bntsin,
since the rejection of the opinion of the arbiter, that
our Gov eminent hav e been constintly endeavoring
to open negot ations with Great Biitainfor the esta-
blishment ot the line according to the lieatv of
1783, 'hat the British Government have declined to
negotiate upon thH basis, and have msis'ed and
still insist, that a conienhcnal line must be snbstim-
for the tualy line That there ma> be no m^t m
upon this part of the subject, th-coi responde '
between the two Governments shou'd be exami ie 1
with care, and it will show that on the 21st ol
July, 13U, Mr Livingston informed Mr Bank-
head nat the decision ot *he arbiter had been re-
jected by the Senate, and that the President, m pur-
suant of the advice of the Senate, piopoed "to
open a new negotiation with his Britannic Majes-
ty's Got ernment for the ascertainment of the boun-
dary between the possessions of the United States
and tboic of Great Britain on the northeastern
frontier of the United States, according to the treaty
ef peace of 1783," and it was further suggested that
if the pai t.es should be unable to agree upon the
establishment of the treaty line, means might be
found of avoiding the constitutional difficulties
that hitherto had attended the establishment of a
boundary more convenient to both parties than that
designated hv the treaty, and that such a negotia-
tion would naturally embrace the right of naviga-
tion of the river St John On the 14th of April, 1833,
Sir Charles R Vaughan replied "that his Majesty's
Government regret that they cannot disccv er in this
proposition any probable means of arriving at a
settlement of tins difficult question It appears to
his Majesty's Government to be utterly hopeless to
attempt to find ou', at this time of day, by means
of new negotiation, an assumed line of boundary
which successive negotiators, and which commis-
sioners employed on the spot have, during so many
j ear-, failed to d scover, &c , that his Majesty's
Government will eageily avail themselves of any
probable ciance of bringing the question to a sa-
tisfactory settlement, and wri! ¡ose no time m en-
deavoring to ascertain from Mr Livingston m the
fir-t place, what is the principle of the plan of boun-
dary which thf  American Government appear to
con emp'ate as likplj to be to he more convenient to
both parties, &.c , whether any, and what irrarge-
m°nt for avoiding the constitutional difficulties
has j et been c ncluded with the State of Mame,
fha* it was necessary that his Majesty's Govern-
iti'nt sho' 1 he infoimed of tne basis upon which it
is prop wi to nesro late before they can either cn-
Iritain the pvow l, or decide upon instructions to
be p ven, that they must be previously assured that
the President w ill possess the power of carrj mg in-
to effect his part of any engagement, &c , and tnat
hio Majesty cannot consent to embanass the nego-
tiation respecting the boundary, by mixing -up with
tt a discussion respecting the navigation of the nvei St.
John "
On the 30th of April, 1833, Mr. Livingston pro-
posed to Su Charles R Vaughan that the disad-
vantages of the modes of settlement heretofore
adopted mght be avoided by appointing anew
commission, consisting of an equal number of
commiss oners, with an umpire selected by some
friend!v soveieign, to oecide on all points on which
they disagree, or ]>y ,i commission entirely com-
posed of sk'fui men in Euiope, so selected, to be
atienden in the suivey and view of the country,
by a^-ei t% ippomled bj the paities. And furthei
suggested that where two natural boundaries are
named, and tunning from one towards the other
on the prescribed course will not touch the other,
the ui'e is not to consider the boundary as one im-
possib'e to be traced, but to pieserve the natural
hound-iij, iml to r^ach it by the nearest direct
course Thus, it after more accurate surveys
shall have been mede, it should be found that the
north c< ar-e from the head of the St Croix should
not reach the h ghl?nds, which answer the descrip-
tion of those des gnated in the treaty of 1783, then
a direct line from the head of the St Croit, what-
ever may be its direction, to such highlands ought
■o be adopted, and the line will still be conforma-
ble fo the treat}, and Mr Livmgton informs Sir
Chirles R Vaughan, tnat the anticipations of an
aTinsreinent by which the Government of the Uni-
ted States mieht be enab'ed to treat ior a more
cinvemmt boundary have not been realized, and
in f-■ piesent stn't of things, they must treat on
thi b"sis pf the establishment of (he bovwlaiy yie-
senttd b¡ Oc iieity
On ll'h o."Mi}, 1S33, Su Challes R. Vaagfnn
replies d""i' he is convinced tiial it is hopeless to ex-
pect a f\\arable lem't liom a renewed necotia-
1 o i i pon I at i «sit, tint with levari to the propo-
sil t a oomfissjo.i of bo ikIt; it wou'd be with
great reluctance taaf the Butish Governmtnt could
consent to h^ve recour-e to such a measure, and
that he does i ot sutiiciently comprehend the other
vic>v which Mi L hris partialh developed, and
stigg^sw that in deviating from ¡he direct north
line might lead to mountains to the eastwmcf of it,
which would trench upon his Majesty's territories
of New Brunswick, and invites Mr. JL. to offer some
more prompt and effectual measure for the settle-
ment of the boundary, than the renewal of a nego-
tiation on an inadmissible basis, or having recourse
again to commissions of boundary, &c.
On the 28th May, 1833, Mr. Livingston informs
Sir Charles R. Vaughan that the American Go-
vernment make no pretensions further east than a
line directly north from the source of the river St.
Croix, but if, on a more accurate survey, it should
be found that the north line mentioned m the
treaty should pass each of the highlands therein
described, and that they shou'd be found at some
point farther west, then the principle would apply,
viz that the direction of the line to connect the
two natural boundaries must be altered, so as to
suit theur ascertained position, and to simplify the
opel&tion, the President is willing that the com-
missioners should be restricted to the single que*,
tun of determining the point designated by the
treaty as the highlands which divide the waters, to
which point a straight line shall be drawn from the
monument, etc
On the 31st May, 1833, Sir Charles R Vaughan
replies, that it appears to him that the question of
boundary can only be set at rest by an abandonment
of the defective description of boundary contained in
the treaty, and the two Governments mutually
agreeing upon a conventional line more convenient to
both parties, that the proposition of Mr. Living-
ston is so restricted to the terms of the treaty, that the
basis of it is the same as that which he has been in-
structed by his Government to inform the Govern-
ment of the United States that it was hopeless to ne-
gotiate upon While the point of departure of the
line to be traced according to the proposition of
Mr Livingston is clearly established, the point at
which it is to terminate is left in doubt, and to be
decided by the special commission, etc. He wishes
to be informed what limitations it is intended to put
upon the course to be followed by the commission;
whether the attention of the commissioners is to be
directed to any particular spot, or whether they are
to be left at liberty to stop at the first highlands
answering the required description, and observes
that the impression left upon his mmd, after a con-
versation with Mr.Xi vingston, and the production of
a map upon a small scale, is, that the highlands to
be sought m the manner he proposed, would proba-
bly be found north of the Si Johns, ¡rut westward
some miles of the river St. Franc's, and that he
would be happy to receive from Mr McLane
some further explanation of the intended coarse to
be pointed out to the special commissioners.
On the 5th June, 1833, Mr McLane replies that
it i" not expected that any Imitations will be put
upon the course to be pu'sued by the special com-
missioners, but such as are required by a faithful
adherence to the description of the boundary in the
treaty of 1783, and proposes to make another effort
to overcome the difficulty, and discarding the due
n^rth line, should that become necessary; to seek
for and fnd, m the first place, the " highlands
which divide those rivers that empty themselves
into the river St Lawrence, fiom those which fall
into the Atlantic Ocean," and when these shall be
found in any part of the disputed territory, north or
south of the St Johns river, to draw a line from
the monument to the said highlands, and to that
point thereof which shall be nearest to a due north
line from the monument
On the 10th February, 1834, Sir Charles R
Vaughan replies, that no satisfactory or useful le-
sult could be obtained from the local survey pro-
posed bv the American Government, until the two
parties are agreed upon certain points mged by him,
and says no doubt can exist that bj s,oius far enough
fo the westward, such highlands as those required by
the treaty could be found, because it is well known
that the high giound m the neighborhood of the
source of the St Johns divides the Kennebec, wh.ch
tails into the Atlantic Ocean, from the C/mwiiere,
which falls into the St Lawrence, and upon a full
view of the matter, his Majesty's Government think
that, in the first place, and previously to any furthei
negotiation, they are eníiífe<f to claim from the Go-
vernment oi the United States an acaiMf¡eence in
the decisions pronoujapi by the arbiter upon all
