motives which induced the chairman (Mr Grundy) to make
the motion to dischaige the committee, are fully indicated by
the debates upon his resolution The session was. near its
Clo e Mr Newton alleged as his reason for moving the poet
ponement, that 'the time rapidly approached at which the
House had resolved to adjourn" —"that but nine days remamed
ol the session," and the journals show that Congress did aujourn
on the 16ih April only eight days afterwards The subj ct
■was not brought up m the Senate but the decided expression oí
the judgment of the Hou->e aeawst a motion tur an indefinite
postponement is tonel usive proof of the solicitude which was
felt by a majrnty of that body that a Bank charter, in some
e pe, should pasa Such is the hftory of the failure of ano'her
of the attempts to which the Senator from Pennsylvania has
alluded

Sir, with all respect for th.e opinions of gentlemen, I am com
polled to say that, in my opinion, such a doctrine i° subversive
of great principles closely connected with the durability oí the
Constitution If the construction ofusd>ubtiu! puwers can
never be established by piecedenf, 'hose powers must
continue to be dangerous souices of collisioi between the de
