near Apache Pass, and two of the men were killed by the Indians; the survivor was purued some forty miles and bately escaped death. He was captured by the Texans near Mesilla and the distapches to General Canby fell into their hands. From these they learned the exact strength of General Carleton's command and the intended movement of the column. On the 22nd of June General Carleton sent forward Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, of the First Cavalry California Volunteers, with 140. This was the advance guard of the column. With the exception of frequent skiemishing with Indians and the loss of three men killed and several wounded at Apache Pass, the party met with no other enemy before reaching the Rio Grande.

Apache Pass is about midway between Tuscon, and the river. The pass is through a spur of the Chiricauha Mountains, about three and a half or four miles long. In this pass is a fine spring of water, and a favorite haunt of the Indians. A company of infantry and a part of a company of cavalry, with two mountain howitzers, fought the Indians at this spring for four hours. A number of the savages were killed in the fight. Our loss was three killed and several wounded. On either side of this pass extends a plain from thirty to forty miles in width. The Indians can see parties approach and lay in wait for them. On the 17th of July, preparations for the movement of the command having been completed, General Carleton issued the following general order: *

As soon as the arrival of Colonel Eyre on the river was known the Texans made a hasty flight. Their army was completely demoralized, and Colonel Eyre's force magnified fourloud. What they could not carry with them they destroyed. One hundred and fifty six and wounded were left in hospital at Franklin, Tex., and above. Colonel eyre crossed the river near Fort Thorn and pushed down toward the retreating rebels. He entered Las Cruses, opposite Mesilla, and raised our national colors. Franklin was also occupied by a detachment of his commaneton, with the head of the column, reached the river on the 8th of August, the time consumed in the march being eighteen days. The sight of this beautiful stream after the many days of toil and suffering gladdened the hearts of all. The last day's march was particularly severe; over forty miles had been made by the infantry without water without a murmur. The desert had been conquered, and the command arrived on the river in good fighting condition. No deaths had occurred between Tucson and the river, and but few remained on the sick list. General Carleton crossed the river at the point where Colonel Eyre crossed. The river at the point where Colonel Eyre crossed. The river was so high that it could not be forded, and the only boats were two small scows, made by Colonel Eyre. First the animals were swum over. This was successfully accomplished; none were lost. A rope was attached to both sides of the boats and extended to eitehr bank of the river. A number of men were stationed on both banks. By this means they were enabled to
