APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 2,
3*7111 Cong. ... 2D SESS.
Report of the Secretary of the Navy.
Senate & Ho. of Eeps.
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
A naval force, auxiliary to and connccted with
the Army movements on the Mississippi and its
tributaries, has been organized, and is under the
command of Flag-Officer Andrew H. Footc, who
is rendering efficient service in that quarter.
The steamers which have been built or pur-
chased for this service by the War Department
arc of a formidable character, and manned by a
class of superior seamen and western boatmen,
who in the preliminary skirmishes already have
done good service, and will, I am confident, ac-
quit themselves with credit in the future. Reports
are appended exhibiting some of the operations of
this command as auxiliary to the military move-
ments on the Mississippi.
PURSUIT OF PRIVATEERS.
It was natural that apprehensions should pre-
vail in regard to armed cruisers commissioned
expressly by the rebel leaders to depredate upon
our commerce. This robbery of merchants and
others engaged in peaceful and lawful pursuits,
by piratical cruisers, is not inconsistent with the
general conduct of those who have violated law
and moral obligations to gratify inordinate ambi-
tion. Our extended commerce presented induce-
ments for piratical warfare, yet but few of our
misguided countrymen have prostituted them-
selves to the purposes of plunder, though thereto
invited, and these few have been in constant flight
to escape the avenging power of our vigilant
naval forces. Such of these cruisers as eluded the
blockade and capture were soon wrecked, beached,
or sunk, with the exception of one, the steamer
Sumter, which, by some fatality, was permitted
to pass the Biooklyn, then blockading one of the
passes of the Mississippi, and, after a brief and
feeble chase by the latter, was allowed to proceed
on her piratical voyage. An investigation of this
whole occurrence was ordered by the Department.
Soon the Niagara and the Powhatan, fiom the
Gulf squadron, followed in vigorous pursuit—the
latter, though long in commission, and with de-
fective boilersand machinery, under her energetic
commander, tracking the pnatieal craft as far as
Maianham. The Keystone State, Richmond,
Iroquois, and San Jacinto, were also in search ot
her at ditleient points and periods. Although a
piratical rover, without license from any recog-
nized or acknowledged Government,and avowedly
engaged in the mbbeiy and plunder of our citi-
zens, 1 regtet to say this vessel has been received,
and her wants supplied, against the remonstrance
of our consuls, by public authorities, in many
foreign ports wheie her charactei was well known.
REBEL EMISSARIES.
Captain Charles Wilkes, in command of the
San Jacinto, while searching m the West Indies
for the Sumter, leceivrd information that James
M. Mason and John Slide!!, disloyal citizens and
leading conspirators, were with their suite to em-
bark from Havana in the English steamer Trent,
on their way to Europe, to promote the cause of
the insurgents. Crusina; in the Bahama channel
he intercepted the Trent on the 8th of November,
and took from her these dangerous men, whom
he brought to the United States. IIis vessel hav-
ing been 01 dered to i rfit forservice ai Charlestown,
the prisoners were retained on board and con-
veyed to Fort Waiien, when' thev wore com-
mitted to the custody of Colonel Dimmick, in
command of that fortress.
The prompt and decisive action of Captain
Wilkes on this occasion merited and received the
emphatic approval of the Department, and if a
too generous forbearance was exhibited by him
in not capturing the vessel which had these rebel
enemies on board, it may, in view of the special
circumstam es, and of its patriotic motives, be ex-
cused-, but it must by no means be permitted to
constitute a precedent hereafter for the treatment
of any case of similar infraction of neutral obli-
gations by foreign vessels engaged in commerce
or the carrying tiade.
TIIE NA\AL FORCE AND ITS INCREASE.
This brief review of the principal operations of
the Navy, under the new and extraordinary de-
mands that were made upon its efficiency, natu-
rally introduces an exposition of the measures
adopted in conformity with the legislative P0^cy
of Congress to increase its available force. The
measures which were adopted by the Department,
in advance of the special session in July, for aug-
menting theNavy,and the recommendations and
suggestions which I had the honor at that time to
submit, received the sanction and approval of
Congress. Immediate action had been rendered
necessary in consequence of events that had been
precipitated upon the country, and for which no
legislative provision had been made. Only a
feeble force of men and vessels, scarcely sufficient
for ordinary police operations, was at that time
available on the Atlantic coast. In order that the
condition of the Navy on the 4th of March may
be rightly understood, it will be well to state the
position and character of each of the vessels at
that dale.
The home squadron consisted of twelve vessels,
and of these only four were in northern ports
and available for scrvice, viz:
Name. Class. Guns. Station
Pawnee Scievv sloop... 8 Washington.
Ciu.sader Steamer  8 New Yoik.

Add to these the vessels on the Pacific coast,
the steam fiigate Niagara, which was returning
from Japan, and four Tenders and storesliips, and
there was a total, as stated in the last report, of
forty-two vessels, carrying live hundred and fifty-
five guns and about seven thousand six hundred
men, in commission on the 4th of Maieh last.
Without waiting the arrival of vessels from our
foreign squadrons, the Department eaily directed
such as were dismotitled and in ordinary at the
different navy-yards, and which could be made
available, to be repaired and put in commission.
When the vessels now building and purchased,
of every class, are armed, equipped, and ready
for service, the condition of the Navy will be as
follows:

Making a total of 264 vessels, 2,557 guns, and
218,016 tons. The aggregate number of seamen
in the service on the 4th of March last was 7,600.
The number is now not less than 22,000.
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW VESSELS.
Most of the public armed vessels being of such
size and draught of water that they could render
only impcrfoct blockading service, immediate
measures were taken by the Department to carry
into effect the policy of the Government, in ad-
vance of the special session of Congress, by con-
tracting for the construction of twenty-three
steamers, which should be of light draught, but
heavy armament. Congress, at the regular ses-
sion, had authorized the building of seven screw
steamers, and as there were four yards, in each
of which two might be built, the Department, in
the existing emeigency, and in anticipation of
the action of Congress when it should convene,
