Mr PRATT, m the course of the above debate,
under the impression that the appeal from the

posing to appropriate #100,000 for a dry-dock at
Brooklyn was still pending, intimated his wish
to address the House upon that subject; but as
he was mistaken as to the question now before
the committee, and holding to the opinion that
I time is money, if the House had no objection, he
would write his views out upon that subject, in-
stead of contributing to its waste at this late pe-
I nod of the session. The House granted him
leave

' delphia certain arrears of salary, or so much of
I that sum as might be necessary, and, in support
i of the claim, said it had been acknowledged by
the  collector and  Secretary of the Treasury as
I JUMr CAMBRELENG said he had no doubt
the justice of the claim, but upon the same prin-
| ciple as the amendment offered by him, pioposmg
to supply a deficiency  in the  salaries of other
custom house clerks, it was out of order     The
Chan decided his amendment was m order, but
the committee thought pioper to reverse that de-
cision     To  be  consistent, the committee ought
to declaie this out of ordei
I      The  CHAIRMAN,  however, again  decided
