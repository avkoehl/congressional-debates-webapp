Will send Lieutenant Brown and an acting quartermaster to receipt for stores. Your division will remain at Atlanta till we are ready to leave the State, unless it should get on the track of J. D., in which case it will go for him to the Mississippi. You can change to Atlanta whenever you think best. When you get there I want you to do your best toward getting bridges over the rivers on the way to Dalton. I will send up a pontoon bridge for the Chatahoochee under direction of Major Hubbard.
