Thisletter(Mr B said) relatesto four letters which he (Mr.
B ) had sent lor publication to St Louis, where the parties who
wrote them reside, and weie accompanied by a letter which
showed whosentthem,andforwhatreasontheyweresent The
four letteis contained untruths m relation to himself and one of
his constituents, and also solicited a change in the St Louis post
office, for unworthy party purposes Mr B read the parts of the
letters which he alleged contained untruths m relation te himself
and one of bis constituents, (the present postmaster,) and also
the part which related to the imposition which had been prac
used upon the President, and which bad led him to do an act
which violated his inaugural address in relation to removals
from office, violated the Presidential orderagamst official in-
terference m polities, and prostuuted the post office to the pur-
poses of faction and party Having read these parts of the
letters, Mr B said that, since the Postmaster General had
mixed himself with this business, and had called upon a Sen-
ator foi an early answer, he would go on to say what he had
not said before, and that was, that the Postmas er General him
self was one of those who had led the President to violate his
mauguial address, to vicíate the circulai against official inter-
ference in politics, and to prostitute the post (ffice to the base
purposes of party, and that he had done this foi the base pur
pose of turning a good man out of office, and putting one of
his own connexions into it
Mr 8 said this was the answer which he gave to the letter of
the Postmaster Cencía,, and he gave it at as early an hour as
possible in the day—for it was not yet one o'clock—as time and
opportunity would permit    He gave it early, and he gave it
publicly, and ''rom his seat in the ¡senate, for the inquiry related
to thmgb depend'ng m the Senate, and which would find a proper
time for discussion, and for ample communication to the puh-
lic    He had much to show and to prove on this subject, and it
should all be forthcoming at the proper time    At present, he
would only say that he had answered the inquiry addressed to
the Senator fiom Illinois, and should send to the press, as part
oi these remarks, the four letters m question, and his own, en
closiogthem, to the editor of the Reporter in St Louis
THE   DIFFICULTIES   IV    RHODE   I*L AND—THREE
COMPAMES OF UNITED STATES TROOPS MARCH.
1NG IN IO 1HAT STATE, BY ORDFR OF THE PRES-
IDEN!, TO   PLT DOWN THE ffUITRAGE PARI Y
AND CONSTITLTION
Mr ALLEN remarke I fhat he had heretofore introduced a
resolution calling on the President of the Uniied States for m-
foimatiou of the state of facts touching the difficulties In Rhode
Isl ind and on which he founded his letter to the Governor of
thit Sta'e Tie several motions he had submitted heretofore
to take this resolution from the table, and to have it adopted,
were voted down In order to show the propriety now of action
on that resolution—the peculiar propriety of its adoption—he
would state to the Senate wha,t he had understood to be the fact,
Iioiti various sources, which1 could be relied on, and which
he believed was tiue
Mi PRESTON here rosetoaquestion of order, whether the
Senator could make allusion to the affairs in Rhode Island on
a motion to take a resolution from the table, which motion
itself wis notdebatablc
Mr ALLEN did not with to debate the cond tion of affairs in
Rhode Island, but merely wished to state a fact, derived from
an o i questionable source, as an additional reason why the reso
lution should be taken up and adopted^
Mr PRESTON persisted in his point of order
Mr ALLE'V then submitted his motion to take the resolution
u p from the table, and demanded the yeas and nays on it, which
weie ordered
The Cletk here proceeded to call the roll, and when the name
of Mi Allen was called—
Mr ALLEN rose, aud without responding to the call, wished
to test the sense of the Senate whether it was not in oi der for
him to state afact which came to his knowledge^withiu the last
thirty s x houis, (which, if true, and of which he had no doubt,
would shake this country to its foundation,) and which would
go to show, conclusively, that the motion to take ihe resolution
Irom the table ought io be adopted He submitted this point of
ordei, founded on the objection of the Senator from South Caro-
lina, [Mr Preston,] for the decision of the Chair
The CHAIR decided that the yeas and nays having been or-
tiered on the motion to take the resolution from the table, the
¡3enatoi could not recur to the point of order raised by the Sena-
tor from South Caio ina, iMr Prestoh ] and demand a de
ci«ion of the Chair on that question, that should have been done
before the yeas and nays were ordered
Mr W RIGHT took an appeal from the decision of the Chair
This appeal was argued at great length by Messis WRIGHT
ALLEN, KING, and WOODBURY, who rontended that there
was no i ule oí the Senate to sustain such a decision of the Chair,
but that the courtesy of khe Senate had alwavs g ne farther—
that it had gone so far as toreimit Sena'ors to deba e aques
tion even a'ter a response had been made to the cah of the Sec
leiaiy on taking the yeas and nays They maintained that the
practice of tie Senate had invariably been to permita Senator
to give his íeasons before a response Co the call of the Secre
tary.
Mr PRESTON maintained that the decision of the Chair
wis correct
Mi BAYARD argued that whatever had been the prac-
tice of the Senate, (which he admi ted was against the
decision of the Chair,) yet the decision of the Chair was con ect,
as founded on the rules
Some diffeience of opinion arose between the above Senator
as to vvhelher the decision ofthe Chan was not two fold, whe
ther he did not a'so decide that it was not in order for 'he Sena-
torfiom Ohio to debate thequestion, on the ground that the mo
tion to take the resolution from the table was not debatable
Mr. HUNTING! ON maintained that such wa3 substan-
tially the decision ofthe Chair
The CHAIR admitted that be had decided, first that it was
notm oider for the Senator to make any remaiksafier the yeas
and nays had beenordeied, and the Secretary had proceeded in
the call, but he modified his decision to cover the giound as.
sumed by Mr Huntington, as that on which his decision had
been founded,
Mr WRIGHT then withdrew his appeal founded on the
Chair'sorigmal decision
Mr. ALLEN recapitulated the matter, and observed that,
when interrupted by the Senator from South Carolina he was
going on to state a fact, or what he believed to be a fact, to show
that the motion which he was about to submit was of such con-
sequence that, if adopted, it might save the Government from
being embroiled in civil war-----
Mr PRESTON called the Senator from Ohio again to order.
Mi LINN rose to ask his friend from South Carolina [Mr.
Preston] not to press this rigid mode of proceeding, as it was
evident that it would not effect his object It was in vain to en-
force a decision made on a specific occasion by the Senate last
session, when political excitement ran so high, as a settled pre-
cedent for action upon other occasions. That decision was not
only in direct contravention of the long established practice of
the Senate for years and yeais, but in the teeth of all par-
liamentary rules The facts of this case cannot be suppressed;
and this mode of attempting thatoojectis so contrary to the set-
tled practice and courtesy of the Senate, that he hoped the Sen-
ator from South Carolina, [Mr Preston ] on reconsideration,
would see the propriety o( withdrawing his point of order.
Mr PRESIÓN ob ived, that no one was more disposed to 
yield both to the practice of the Senate and to the usual cour 
tesy due from one membei to another, upon all subjects in.
themselves properly debatable, but on this subject it had beer 
derided by the Senate, repeatedly, that it was not expedient to
debate it, and therefore he pressed the observance of the rule.
He was sorry he could not accede to the request ofthe Senator
from Missouri [Mr Li\'N J He felt bound to persist in his
point of order
The PRESIDENT pro tern said that the Chair had been
called on for a decision upon this point. Tne Senator from
Ohio had moved to take up the lesolutioii which he had offered"
some dayb ago , and offered to state certain facts asa reason for
taking the matter up Itwas unnecessary for the Chair to go
further back than the last session for the decision of this que*-
tion
Tne President;)™ tern here lead from the journal ofthe
Senate, where it had been decided that, upon amotion to take
up a subject that had been laid upon the table, the quesiion
should he taken without debate.
Mr ALL bN desired I hat the sense ofthe Senate should be
taken as to whether they would now sustain that decision
It was well known that he had, some time ago, submitted a
resolution calling upon the Executive of fhe United States for
information as to the facts m his possession, and upon which
he had taken some action m regard to the affairs of Rhode Is-
land He held it was not the business of this Government to in
terlere with the affairs of that State, and his sole object was to
obtain information as to the facts upon which the Executive
had proceeded [Mr PRESTON here made a point of order,
and insisted that the Senator from Ohio had no right to enter
into any argument or explanation whatever ]
Mi ALLEN 1 he Senate would pel ceive that he was lilus-
tralmg what would necessauly be the effects arising from the
decision of the Chair, if that decision were sustained, for it was
quite as important, in all such cases, to look to the consequences
at wng from the decision, as to the decision itself He had stated
what the resolution was, and what was its object, and he had now
made a motion to take that resolution up and upon making
that motion, he had proposed to submit to the Senate a fact,or
that which he had reason to believe to be a fact, directly refer-
ring to the matter to which the resolution had reference; and
he desired to state this fact as a reason which ought to prevail
with the Senate to induce them to take It up
Mr PRESTON submitted to the d cisión of the Chair
whether this course was correct
The CHAIR responded, that it had been declared by the Sen-
ate at the last session, upon the occurrence of a similar question
of order, to be incorrect
Mr. BUCHANAN rose and remarked that, in his apprehen-
sion, a decision ofthe teenateupon a point of Older was not irre-
versible, it was not like the laws of the Medes and Persians
They certainly had the power of reconsidering the question, and
of determining as to the right of debating a subjec* upon a mo-
tion to take up that subject Court  of justice often reversed
their own decisions He thought that reason and common sense
dictated that the decision of the Senate upon that point of order
should be reversed, and if the Senator had an extreme case to
state, he should most assuredly be permitted to do it argumenta 
tively, to show that the decision of the Senate would be de-
structive of the lnteiests of the country
Mr MERRICK inquired whether, if thedecision oftheChair
were sustained, the gentleman would be restrained from pro-
ceeding!
Mr. ALLEN observed, that he did not consider that he would
be entirely precluded The decision ofthe Chair waB calcula-
ted to circumscribe the range of his observations, but not to
prohibit him from adducing arguments altogether. In hw
view the decision was entirely wrong, it was wrong to pre-
scribe to a Senator what arguments he should use, and what
he should not use By doing so, the very strongest and most
forcible reasons which he had to adduce might be excluded.
What was the object ofthe appeal* It was to enable the Senate
to review the decision of the Chair, and in order that the Sea-
ate might properly review the question, Senators had unques-
tionably the light to give all the reasons appertaining to the con-
sequences resulting from the decision oftheChair Itwas the
practice in courts of justice, even upon thea-nstabstruse points
of law, for the courts to reconsider and reverse their decision;
but it would be absurd to say that counsel should not be al-
lowed to illustrate the justice or injustice, the good or evil
consequences, resulting from the decision against which he
c intends He should say very little more He had already
stated that it was the object ofthe resolution to prevent an in-
terference in the affairsof Rhode Island
Mr MERRICK said he understood the Chair to have decided
that it is nut m ordei to discus the subject of the resolution.
Mr ALLEN The Chan decided that the remarke I made
were not in order Very well, I am willing to consider them
out of order, and I now pi opose to offer some other remarks.
It was well known to every Senator that the resolution had
reference to the affairs of Rhode Island He had proposed to
state only what the Senate knew perfectly well already, morder
to show the propriety of taking up the resolution, and artng
upon it The whole country had been put in possestíns ofthe
fact, that the Pres.dtnt of the United States had-taken-some
action in reference to Khode Is^nd.  He was merely going to
