CITY POINT, August 25, 1864.

General MEADE:

I think it advisable to get all our forces back on the line we now hold, and strengthen it well. When that is done we can detach 15,000 or 20,000 men, and start them early in the morning so as to make a march of twenty miles, and destroy the road that distance. We may be able at the same time to send the army gun-boats up the Chowan with a detachment of troops to destroy the triangle of roads between the Nottoway and Roanoke.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-3 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I send a dispatch* just received from Hancock. I have ordered Mott's reserves and Willcox's division, Ninth Corps, down the plank road to the branching off of the Reams' Station road to watch Hancock's rear, and move up to his support if necessary. If the enemy will only attack either Hancock or Warren we are all right, but he may bother us by maneuvering and getting between the two forces.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

(Same to General Humphreys.)

CITY POINT, VA., August 25, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I think from last dispatches received from General Hancock he had better be instructed to fall back at once to our line.
