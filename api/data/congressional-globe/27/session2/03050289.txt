Mr Bayard then entered into a history of the banks of the
District, and referred to the vauous c arter* and acts ex ending
these charters, fiom time to «mo, and dwelt at con&iderabje
length upon the cneumstances undei which the act of 183S
was pa sed b> Congres  m view of the suspension of the New
iTork banks The la^t of these acts expnedm 1S40 dun tig the
longfaessmn. in which the stiugg'e a id tíiffí uitiesm lelation to
those institutions were ¡aJ cor bpicuous JSearly on the las day
of the expiring chartets a particular act Was passed exttn mg
their exi tenet to 1844 It was under the provisions oí
that rooowal that the certificates of deposite, now com
pla ned of by the Senatoi fiom Ohio, were issue J
He íeai the several provisions of the act, anJ leferred to the
fouuh section as the authority under which these certificates
are issued The banks were prohibited, in this piocess of
winding up, from issuing notes or certificates 'payable to bearer,
butexpreasly aJthonzed to l&sue ceitificate* ol deposite oí mo
ney or property by tho stockholders, under obligation to return
it He read one of toese noes to «how that it was m canfor
mity with the fourth section of the act
He denied that this was any violation of the act, and asked,
was the bank to be blamed if the people of the D str ct, undei
the contingent uicumstancesin which noy found hem-delves
placed with iegaid to the depreciated cuuency \ ith wn chthey
were opmes&e , to take thc3o ceitihcate of deposite hi pre

Mi ALLEN renewed his mo ion to lay the bill on the table,
sndstated that lie would afterwards aak to recommit it with in
s ruction*.
Mr WRIGHT asked the Senatoi to suspend his motion for a
moment
Mr ALLEN explained that it was his desire to obtain the
vote first on his motion to lay on the table He would (hen,
with a view of bringing the whole men ■> of the subject before
the senate, move to recommit the bill Ilecalledfor the yeas
and nays, which weieordeied
Theque«t¡on was'then taken on laying the bill on the table,
an 1 resulted as follow

So the "senaie refused to lay the bill on the table
Mr   ALLEN now moved  to recommit   the bi'I   with m
etructmns   m  conformity   with   the   furegoing   resolution
And Mr Alí en proceeded to say that tne ments of the bill be

Mr   IHHRÜ observed that the ac wismtenleJn be í,i

Mr ALLEN proceeded    That would make no difference.
The banks havenothing to do but send their advocates to the
two Hsuses of Congress, and represent that their interesas re
quire an extension or continuance of their charters.   And if
their reasoning be good now, it would be equally good at any
futuie  period, aidso long as it wag permitted topreva.il, eo
long would they continue to plunder the poorer people of the
District    There was one thing which he had noticed m this
District, with soi low and rogrei   the six banks had been dog
emg Congress for five or six years past, and uigtng to beena
bied to continue their system of plunder, by putting in emula-
tion medeemab'e bank papeis and as often as these applications
had been male they had been seen thronging the lobb.es of the
Senate Chamber, only those who weie interested in the sue
cess of the banks— those peisons who  were seeking ior the
\ lundet of the pooi—not those who were piepared to advócate
tie cause of the plundered community, but exclusively bank
officers and bank retainers     and that winch astonished him
more than all wa"to seethe 40000 inhabitants of this District
remain so perfectly quiet and inert at a time wl en their inte-
rests were so vitally concerned withoutcading a single meet-
ing without piescntinga single memoria', without taking the
smallest step, or making the smallest effort to second tho eser
tionsef those who were struggling to give them a sound in

the absolute dominion which the banks had acquired over the
