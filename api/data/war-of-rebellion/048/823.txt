Numbers 100. Reports of General Robert E. Lee, C. S. Army, commanding Army of Northern Virginia.

ORANGE COURT HOUSE,

November 26, 1863.

Your dispatch received. I should like the assistance of Colonel Lee, if convenient. The enemy's whole force is moving to our right, and will reach the lower fords of the Rapidan to-night. I am making a corresponding movement.

Prepare the troops about Richmond. All should be advanced toward Hanover Junction that can. Forage should be particularly forwarded to us.

R. E. LEE.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS.

*Major-General Early commanded this corps during the Mine Run Campaign, and was probably in command of it at this date.
