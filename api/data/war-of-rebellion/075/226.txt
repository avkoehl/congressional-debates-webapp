General Hooker assures me that the bridge will be at disposal in one hour. He is now crossing his train, or rather a portion of it. Shall I wait here or proceed at once to your position? If I can commence crossing in an hour I can get over with my infantry, artillery, ambulances, ammunition wagons, and enough of subsistence wagons to supply my command from to-night, besides marching the infantry, say, from six to eight miles, perhaps farther. Please advise me if I had better give up attempting to cross here if I find that the crossing of General Hooker's train is to be delayed considerably beyond an hour.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding 2nd Division, 23rd Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Field's Mill, Ga., May 17, 1864-11.10 a.m.

Brigadier General H. M. JUDAH,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: If you have no prospect of crossing your command over the river where you now are at once or in a very short time the commanding general directs that you march your division without delay to this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 17, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

GENERAL: After getting your last note, I issued rations, started rapidly in advance and ascertained personally the condition of affairs at both fords, in time to keep the column moving to Field's Mill. I was not willing to run the risk of further delay at Hooker's bridge. I passed your headquarters, but learned that you were with General McCook, and came on here. I sent for the division to come on, and shall put it into camp between Hovey and McCook, unless your order differently. It is the only available camping-ground this side of your headquarters.

Very respectfully,

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Big Spring, May 17, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. F. BOYD,

Chief Quartermaster, Twenty-third Army Corps:

COLONEL: The commanding general desires you to move the wagon train of the corps by the nearest and most practicable route from where it now is to Calhoun. It is desirable to keep the train near the rear of center of the army, and not have it exposed on the flank as it would necessarily be if it followed in the rear of the corps. Please report to these headquarters as soon as the train reaches Calhoun.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
