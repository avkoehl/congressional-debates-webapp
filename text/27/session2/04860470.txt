CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Me* F said that no man entertained a more profound vene-
ration for the sages who draughted our national Constitution
than he ¿hi Whenever they expressed their opinions on sub
jects connected with Government, they were to be heard with
Very great deference, but he did not, nevertheless, hold himself
lK>una ty those opinions And one reason which the moie
fully reiie/ed his mind from such obligation was, that these
great and patriotic men were kno wn to differ among the mselves,
jsome of them verged attrrosC towards radicalism itself, while
others had a leaning quite as strong to the forms Of monarchy
under which they had been brought up Their individual
opinions were influenced accordingly, and in estimating their
we:gatj this was always to be kept m view The opinion of the
Whole body was one thing, that of individuals was another
MrjMad&on had been supporting, not expounding, the amend
meat in question (Here Sfr-F again quoted a speech of Mr
Madison, in order to show that when the Constitution declared
thai Congress might, "at anytime, by law, make or alter such
regulations" as the State Legislatures had made in relation to
the mode, &c of holding elections, it meant that Congress, if
the States had made improper regulations o i fch a subject,
mightattar them, but the power to "make" regulations was
not to be exercised by Congress, unless the states should neglect
or refuse to mike tiiem In eithei case, the States must fiist
act ?                                     t
Mi F contended that it was as fan to refer to contení pora
neous history for the purposed limiting and restricting a pow
erm the Constitution as of establishing it Ifa power could be
made, by construction, it might be qualified by construction ,
and ¡uat so with contemporaneous testimony
The States must first act they must establish some mode by
which Representatives should be appointed They were to
"prescribe" the times, place", &c , ol holding elections To
prescribe, according to the denvation of the word, was "to
write before " Ii what they wrote was wrong, Congress must
alter it The power to make regulations on this subject was
given to Congress as a conservative power, from necessity, that
the Government might go on, but the power to district the
.States was not thus necessary as a conservative power, because
the Government could go on whether the States were dis
tnctedor not The character of the men, the majority of such
a body as. the Convention, forbade the idea that they meant to
deceive the people by giving them ao instrument containing
¡hidden powers that they never suspected, and which were to be
drawn out of it hy construction, by implication, and by resort
to contemporaneous history Mr ( next adverted, on the sub-
ject of contemporaneous expositions, to the acts of the various
State conventions these wete parties to the instrument, and
then consti uctione of it were oí weight in the question Their
understanding had been very different from what was proposed
Kiting amendment, and, after that exposition had been acqui
esced m for more than halfacentuiy, without remonstrance or
complaint, to call up a latent power by implication to scatter
fir/ebtands among the States, to multiply causes of disunion,
was, to say the least oi it, musv unwise
Mi F diiscUimed all intention of impugning the punty of
the motives of those who had introduced the amendment, or
their sagacity, t ey might be much wiser than he, but he must
still insist that, in expounding the Constitution, we ought to ad
hore to the plain and ordinary use of iw language If a plain
mechanic were asked " what is the mannei of holding elec
Uon \ri your State J" he would descube what passed at the
palls—the tumulus—thedetailsofchoosing the State Reptesen
tattves to Congiess, he would not understand the question aa
rdeuingto the district system 01 the general ticket system
he would go into the modus ope? andi
Gentlemen said it wis quite immaterial what might be the
action of the sítales on this subject the only effect of then
refusing to markoutdistncts would be, that they would remain
unrepiesented in Congress Tins seemed m their eyes a thing
of very hltla weight oi consequence But, suppose ail the
States should thus leiuse—-(and such might be the case, should
State pride uke the alarm, and repudiate this assumption of
Fedeidl power)—then all would be unrepresented, and then—
the Givemment would beat an end Would this, too, be a
email matter? He rather supposed the gentlemen would think
ihm a thing of some little importance
Afr F now took up in suctession, the several reasons given
yea'uiday by Mr IIalsted, as having induced the Committee
of elections to report this amendment to the House, and ar-
gued to show that they had no force As to the first—namely,
the effecting of uniformity to elections throughout the ¡states—
the measure proposed would effect no such thmg I here
would be uniformity neither in the time nor the mode, save in
this one íespect,—that all would elect by districts Had they
propose! a single day for the election throughout the Union,
more of unif >i unity would have been attained, and much good
fjrobably eflet ted the alleged piocessof 'colonizing" would at
I ist have been greitly prevented But they had aimed at uni
i >rmuy m one thine only Neither did their amendment accom-
iiiati an erpufiry >t lights, nor. advance the inftuenceof the
d* n icruic punciple Mr T strenuously insisted that us
e fleet would be the duectcontraty Besides, how could Congress
¡ o&suss the re ¡uisite local knowielge logo into the operation
( f laying off diitncts within the States? Would any enntend
hat they were m circumstanced to do this as the State Legisla
tuies could?
A gentleman from Ohio (Mi Pendleton] had admired the
unanimity of the committee on the expediency oi exei tine the
f j \er of Congres? if such power did exist, in establishing the
1 strict system bciicely a man had contended for electing by
<*eierAl ticket True, but the amendment directed the States,
iterated to a sovereign and independent legislative power ii
< ongress haú powei to do this the uowei ol the States wasj so
idi annulle 1 fl their power wh controlled by a power of su
penoi aufhortty, then it wis comp'etely absorbed in that greater
power, and hid no longer any existence Power implied wiil,
a 11 there coul 1 bo only one operative will in i's exercise The
a ion of Congre^ was only to be put forth when the States did
not act
As to tb* quest on of expediency, Mr F would not go much
inf) it The digfnet system had met with appiobatioo genei
a!/ amo ig the States thoigh there were a few who fo1* pe
rt 'larrea o is a Iruuel to the general ticket mole It dt I not
fo'tow thar hi* fsvne inn i? was always bf-f m the si ie Vale
at o te turn one ol the mo les might be preferable and ar othei
at another 11 ca^es, fur example, whete there wie no sec
*H>naliateres s mvilvei or whereall wer 1 swallowed in a great
ait gSne-al qiestion Irks that of war and peace, and when
pmuptanctun ed action was demanded by the national honor —
tvM f'iegeupral ticket mode of election might, for the time V
most for the public good Or if a State was in danger, from
combinations against Rer, of losing her just weight in the pub
he councils, then the general ticket system might, mselfde
fence, become necessary The States should be left free to
judge and to act foi themselves
The amendment now proposed went injuriously to affect the
district from which Mr F came Owing to a law of popula
tion which governed all great cities in all countries, which was
found operating in all the larger capitals jf Europe, as well as
m the mare populous of our own cities, the inhabitants came
to be distributed in peculiar classes m different parts of the
same cuy, accoidmg to their occupations and condition in life
The commercial portion of the community would establish
itself in one quarter, the manufacturing in another, the fashion
able and wealthy in another
This was the case in New York The four delegates she
now had were chosen from the city at large, so would the six
be to which she would probably bé entitled by the ratio to be
established in this bill But if the amendment should f revai!,
the city must be subdivided and one come from each district
This would operate there with peculiar seventy In country
places H would not so much be felt, but w heiever a dense popu
lation existed, itsopeiation would be very severely /elt Why
should Congiess mteifeie with things as they s ooJ7 Why
venture on a measuie calculated to wound State pude, and
etu up embittered feelings, when there weie already too many
causes for dissension? Why not leave the States in possession
oía power they had held undisturbed foi mote thatr half a cen-
tury, ¿tad which they had never abused*
Aiter thanks for aü indulgent heai„ig, and congratulation in
the good feeling which had marked the whole debate, Mi F
resumed hisse it
Mr AflfDRTON<=aid he should not have ventuied to ob
ti ude himseh on the committee, provided he had not conceived
this to be a question of very great importance, and were it not
one which the estate which he had the honor id part to repre
sent might be considered as pecuhaily interested, inasmuch as
it had pursueda course, in the choice of its Representatives, dif
fetent from many other States He conceived then, in the first
place, that, admitting the power of districting uV States to exist
in Congress, this amendment did not propose an exercwe of that
power, butamounted to adirection to the States to do it This bill
would not district the States He dented the correctness of the
position of Mr Eve&stt, that it would execute itself How
would it execute uselfi Only by depnvtrg non complying
States of their representation in Congiess This was not d =>
trictmg the States it was commanding and threatening them
it was an oidei, and an oider of the most imperious character,
proceeding from a domineering spirit on the part of the Federal
Government
As to the reply that this amendment no more commanded
action by the States than the bill itself did, when it declared
how many constituents should elect a Representative, it did not
apply, because the act of appouionment was requind of Con
gresb by the Constitution, and was to be the guide of the States
m ejecting Representatives To neglect lo apportion Rep
reaentdtives, would be to abandon then duty and violate their
oaths, but the Consutution nowheiereqmrtd Congress to dis
tuct the States, or to declare that, if the state Legislatures did
not do h the Stites must lemain urnepre&ented
fie next adverted toa position of Mr Barnard, that the pow
er to elect Representatives to Congiess was a delegated power,
and would not be possessed by the States unless given them by
this clause of the ( on&tiimiuii He masted that the term ' del
egated pflwtV wismapplictble to a State
Mr ZíaR¡VARI>cxpiamed When up before, (he antio^y
of the powers held by com ts had open in his inir d, and he had
used language borrowed from the language of die court-- He
had said that the powei of legulating the time place, and man
ner of hoIdmg{eíectioíis, tvai oiíírinai n the States that the
powei was also original in the General Government, in addi
lion to which, it was, in the latter,appellate and ultimate Both
the Sutes and the General Government derived it from the Con
stitution alone .
Mr ATHERTON denied this position to be coi rect, and insist
ed that theStates wouldhavehad the powerto «endRepresenta
ti ves to Congress, if this cl&useof the Constitution had nevei been
written There was another clause which covered the cast-, u
was this ' Ihe Houseof Repipstntatives shallbe compobul of
members chosen every second yeai by the people of the several
¡states " This conveyed the powei The States po^essed pie
tiaiy power to i eg u late their own elections in at y marner tluy
pleased, and would continue to possess it, unle^ they delegated
it to the General Government 1 hey haJ not done this save in
an exti erne case, to preserve the Government uom de&tiuction
Dividing the States into district* wis not necessary to the pie
seivation of the Government from dest ucuon, and iherefoie
he nevei could believe that u was the intention of the < onstitu
Hon to confet on Congress any such power He therefote
viewed the powei with caution and jealousy He held there
vvasadistmction between election distncts and Congressional
districts An election district was wherever vote1* weie given
in and several of them might exist within one Congressional
diatrict
He denied that the power of districting was derived to Con
cress fiom the word "time " or the word 'piare" in the clause
bo often quoted, though, if the powei existed n would more
naturally follow from the u--e of the wo*d 'place" than the
word ' mannei " Phewoid "manner," as here used, refen ed
to the moleof pieparing and giving the votes at an election
ind had nothug to do with Congie^sional dia-tncf It teferred
to the mode of electing their Representatives, whelhei by ballot
ot viva voce
After alluding briefly to the remarks of Mr King, reat there
a few days sinee, he read extracts from *the remarks of Mr
l)avie=? m the North Carolina convention for the adoption of
the Constitution, to show that the word "mannei" was undet
stood, as he (Mr Athbrton) now understood u, to mean either
viva voce (lection, or election by ballot He also quoted from
a «peech <f Mr Steel m the same convention, to the same
effect Thus, he contended bnefiy, from the words of the
Constitu loh and the contemporaneous constructions ot thatir
strammt that the power to divide the ¡states into districts Wcs
n it intended ts be included m the powers given to the Geneial
Government
A Imi'ting t >i the pulposo of ir£rument(tiat flm powei was
included m the power ovei the times, places and manner ol
holding elections, he contended still, from the words of the Con
■s itufion itself, that tins power was never intended to devolve
ontheGeneiaf Govt rnment under circumstances like the pres
* nt    Ihe words of the clause implied this evidently, as was
forcibly stated by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr FWb 3
It was intended that the States should have the right to exercise
this power, which they could exercise with so much more con-
vemence and satisfaction to their own people Only in cases of
absolute necessity, the General Government should be obliged
to take it to themselves He laid it down as a settled pimciple,
that power was never to be exercised by an> Government un-
less wheie it was cleaily needed When a Government exer-
cised a power when us exercise was not needed, on an occasion
not contemplated, it was an abu^e of power A power exer-
cised when it wa& not needed, was a doubtful power So far
as any Government depaitedfiom this principle, so far it ap-
proached to a tyrannical Government Most especially vvas
this the case in ahmlted Government, like ourown, where the
exercise of pos\ er operated not only on individuals, but u  sove-
reign States 'Ihe intention of the States in forming this Gov-
ernment, was to give to the Geneial Government only such
poweis as weie cleaily arid indispensably neces=ary!,to its exist-
ence
This was an extreme ard ultimate power (ifthe power rest-
ed at all in this clause) onl> tobe exeicisedin cases of absolute
necessity Thisappeare i n*t only fiom the protests of the
States receiving the Constm ion, but fiom all the deDates m
the conventions of the States If the power existed, the exer-
cise oi lton the present occasion would be such as had never
been con emplated This clause oi the ( or stitution wasview
ed with moie alarm by the eeveial Sta es than any other, and
this alarm was only quieted by the as^eit on ofthefnendsof the
Constitution that this power vvas only intended to be exercised
when it was absolutely necessary to enmrc the perpetuation,
and prevent the di&solution, of the Government, by the neglect
oi the States to choose their Representatives to this House
Ilertfeired to the Federalist and to the debates in the sever-
al conventions of Massachusetts North Carolina, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania, foi rat fymg the Constitution, showing the dan
gerous tendency that was apprehended from this clause to a
consoiidition m the General Government, that it wasconsidei
edanextieme ultimate powei , thatit was absurd to suppose
that Congiess would ever undertake to exercise it, unless the
S ates relumed oi neglected to perform their duty in the election
of Repiebentatives, &c
1 he genileman Uom New York [Mr Barnard] had referred
to Mr Madison's cons rue ion of the Constrution, and had
placed paidcular emphasis on his declaration that this clause
wasdesigned to produce umfcimity and prevent dissolution
Uniformity m lepresentation wa«, that each State should be
lepresented By all the able commentators of the Constitution,
he believed this view wa¡> taken Tudge Story, ex Chancellor
Kent, and all, agreed that this was an ultimate, extreme power,
nevei to be exercised unless in cases of necessity, or for pre
venting the dissolution of the Government for want of repre
sentation, when the States should neglect to peifoim the duty
imposed on them in regulating the times, places, and manner
of holding election^ Should they say to the States, You have
rot failed u per foi m this duty, yet we have cheated you to the
adoption of the Constitution, and now we will exercise this
powei, never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution
to be exercised, and concerning which you were told by the ad-
vocates of the Constitution that it wa& ahsurd to suppose it ever
would be exercised^
But the gentleman from New York [Mr Barnard] could not
avoid the conclusion, from all the debates m the convention,
that this wis an extreme and ultimate power, and yet went on
by met prodigious sti ides, and an ived at the conclusion that
the otates had aiieady failed in such a manner as to justify the
interpos-itior of the power of the General Covfrnment Wag
this (act? What iaiiuie had there bee ? Ihe gentleman had
said it was that the states chose s me of th^ir Representatives
by the ger eral ticket system Had he not as good light to say
that they had failed because son e of them chose by districts,
and not bv the general t cket system1 He had an equal right to
c«nsider this a tailuie on the part of tne States The people
had not calle 1 foi i hat extreme exercise orpower, that issue had
not been made before them
The gentleman horn New Jersey, [Mr Halsted ] it seemed
to him, was in some difficul y m attempting to account for the
various amendmer ts to the C nsti ution which had been offered
relative to thissubject The gentleman had acknowledged that
amendments had been offered to give the General Government
powei to oblige the States to send Representatives by districts,
and had tuidei taken to say that, although Congi ess had the power
to do this, yet these amendments were introüuced because they
w tnted the power peirmnent
The gentleman trom New Jersey had said if the laige States
cho^e by the general ticket system, they wou'd be influenced by
caucu es and diftat on-—that a few would govern these States
His aignment furnished the beat answei to thiq If this would
be the effect, it wa¡a evidence enough to show that it would never
be adopted bet aube ti e people would be < pposed to it If this
was the effect ot the geneial ticket system and they did not dis
trust altogether ihe power or the people to gov* rn themselves,
would they not leave it to them to repudiate the system? There
was n > necessity for the exercise of thia ultimate and extreme
powei
Ihe gentleman fiom Ohio [Mr Pendleton] had said that
frauds were e>eretsed under the present system, and thatthe
dtstnctsystem would remedy them He (Mr A ) had known
fai moie instances of fraud  exposed in elections by districts
thin by the gereral ticket Nothing in the world would more
con luce to rao t abominable frau Is and pipe laying than, for
instance to divide New Ioik city into watd  for election of
members of Congress
if it was so important thar our election1' should be by dis-
tricts with reo-ird to Remesentatives—if it wa° contemplated
by the framers of the Constitution—why was it not of as much
importance with íegardto electors9 It had been =aidby gen-
tlemen that their States were in favor of the di^tuct system
If they were let the n have it But if they under ook to move
and stir up this long dormait rower, (if the power existed )
they would subject then peor Ie to the general tieket 'system
affifnst tneirwil' Let the people of the States vote a3 they
wift^ed
The gentleman fiom New York [Mr Fillmore] had seemed
to supi ose that it would be c<n-sidrred strange that he amern-
ber from one of the large ¡Sfatet,, should be willing to*<*jve up
thi* rcntfer to ihe Genenl Government It appeared that the
large Sia'es had adopted the general distuct system, and, instead
of depriving the large States of their power, « would be but
adoptmgfhe pian they had themselves chosen, and depriving
the small State** of their power
it had been srgued that if the large States chose by distiicfc
