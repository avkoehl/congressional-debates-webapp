HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 24, 1864-1 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have got two most intelligent boys, Northern, about fourteen years old. They ran out of Petersburg yesterday. They saw General Lee and heard him say to General Hill and other officers that he would get us out of here by Saturday night. These boys say they are now wagoning supplies from Stony Creek Station, via the plank road, to Dinwiddie Court-House; thence by the Stony Creek road, and that all their cavalry are out in that direction. The road along the railroad goes into Petersburg at Halifax Creek; next west comes the Vaughan road-they live on it at Flowers'; then comes the Squirrel Level road; then the plank. They say the rumor in Petersburg yesterday was Early was coming back. They also say there was talk that they might charge our line somewhere east of the Jerusalem road Early gets back. These boys are so intelligent that I send them up to headquarters. They say the people of Petersburg are much frightened; that General Lee told as boy that was shut in the town like themselves, and was crying, that he'd have us out of by last Friday night.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General GRANT:

I forward the above. I think General Lee meant last Saturday, when he tried and could not get us away. I hope he will try again. Ord seems to think now he will not be attacked.
