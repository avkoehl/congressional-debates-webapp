CLARSBURG, W. VA., November 30, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. YOUR,

Commanding, Beverly:

The advance guard of the enemy, about 100 strong and dressed in Federal uniform, passed the pickets at New Creek unquestioned and entered the fort before their character was ascertained. The main body followed immediately after. Most of our force was captured; Colonel Latham escaped. The enemy retired by way of Greenland Gap, and, emboldened by their success, may go up the Franklin Valley and endeavor to pay you a similar visit. Be on the alert. Communications with Baltimore are open.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.
