propounded, and n consequence of this a mem-
ber thereof re-assemlled the committee for the
purpose of considering whether they shou.'d report
now, or wait until the regular session of Con-

any conclusion, and an adjourned meeting of the
committee was to be held to morrow morning
The gentleman would therefore perceive that he
could not pieiend to say what would be the course
of the committee on this subject The House had
referred to them th« Message of tie President and
the report of the Seuetary of the Treasmy on this
subject, and he w as not piepared to say w hat would
be the decision of the committee, \vhether they
t'iey would be disposed to pass a general bankrupt
law *o affect that class of citizens alluded to by the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr Bicldle,) or
not On to mouow morning, however, the subject t
would be taken up, and he presumed he would be

into disgrace by the war in Florida The gentle-
man from Massachusetts (Mi Cushmg) had ex-
pressed a great deal of sympathetic feeling for the
Indians, m consequence of the violation of the faith
of treaties on the part of the United States towards
the Indians-, but he took it that the gentleman had
looked on the wrong side of the picture It was the
Indians of Florida who had violated their treaty
stipulations The very arms weie put m their
hands by the United States, on the faith of a solemn
treaty, which were turned against us Then why
this sympathy towards these savages1 He feared
not this investigation, for he ventured to say, that
whenever it should be had, that no department of
the Government would be found m fault m not
sooner having suppressed these Indian hostilities
The gentleman from Massachusetts had called the
attention of the House to the subject of the intro-
duction of savages into oui army to cany on this
war, and pronounced it a disgraceful proc°edmg
This, l owever, Mr H contended, was the course
of policy pursued bj all Governments, and by all
armies In Europe, allies were enlisted into all their
armies, and m thiscountrv, the Indians had been in-
troduced into the armies asalhes both of Englandand
the United States This mode of warfare was adopted
by all nations and by all armies, and had been sanc-
tioned by all Governments Frem the moment
that the white men m this conmry commenced th-
war against the savages, to the present day, Indian
allies had been introduced into the army, therefore
he took it that the gentleman had overshot the
m irk in denouncing this measure It was perhap 
natuial enough that those who were far removed
from scenes of Indian waifare and cruelty mis*ht
have a great sympathy for the suffering of thee
savages, but when they came to bear ihe same
relation to them, which the people of the frontier
bore, they would have diffeient feelings He wish-
ed, most sincerely, to pie-vent Ihe uní eccssaiy
slaughter of this unfoitunat no of people but
Ihe means must lie u<ed ti p eve rit ¡heir r p ed i-
tions, which is best calculated to effeel that object
Mr CUSHING rose lo propose an amendment,
which he hoped the gentleman from Virginia would
accept, but while up, he would take occasion to re-
ply to some of the remarks of the gertleman from
Georgia, (Mr Holsey ) Mr C said his position
was a peculiar one He was condemned at home
m no unmeasured terms, because he íefused m this
House and at home to take the part of the Indian
tribes against the United States, and here he was
chu"ed with entertain ng a sympathy for these Se-
rnmo'e Ir dians artteise to the interest of the United
States He lad no svmpathv for (he Indians as
Indians, but he desited to see the unclm ceable
pnneiplts of justice and right obsened He con-
tended that these Indians stood in the relation of
w aids or pupils to the United Slates, and that the
Florida war was a black and damning blot upon
the Goversment of the United States He would
say nothing of the aimy as an army, of the
officers as officers, or of the soldiers as soldiers
He, with the gentleman from Georgia, sympathised
for the brave men who perished in the pestilential
swamps of Florida It was not those who had
seived in the armv, nor those who w-ie command-
cis in that army, who had been disgiaeed, but ll
was (he nation, it was the people of the United
States, it was the Government of the United States
winch had been oisgrac^d, and he repeated, that it
In l been disgiaeed We ha\e marched men by
the thousands, and the tens of thousands, against a
handful of Indians, and are they subdued? Have
they attained the object foi which we sent
them there'' We well know that the Indians hav e
lematned triumphant on the soil in spite of our sol-
diery Our army has been thrown against this
reck, this handful of Seminóles, as the ocean agam«t
the shoie, and been beaten back again and again
and he hce in his place repeated, that it was a dis-
grace to our arms He agreed, however, with the
aenllcman from Georgia, that the sitialion of those
Indians was peculiar, and that the campaign might
have been more reputable to American arms if they
could have found their enemy, and met him face to
face He contended that the gentleman from Geor-
gia h?d not "mown that it was pioper to enlist the
Ird ans as our alltes, by refeience to the allies en-

listed by the armies of Europe There was no ana-
logy between the two casea, mhis opinion, because,
in the case of the European nations-, their allies
were independent, the foreign allies were all inde-
pendent nations, but our Indians were mere waids
or pupils, under the guardianship of the United
States, and therefore they should not be enlisted to
cairy on a war against their brethren He had bo
sympathy with these Indians, other than that which
he had before alluded to He knew what must be the
feelings of those who resided on the Indian frontier,
as his own countrymen in former years had been
accustomed to the nightly surprise of the Indians,
and his own State was dotted with block-hou'es,
erected in the dajs of Indian waifare, but is it to
be said that because the savages violate treaties,
that the Government of the United States is to be
faitnless, and violate treaties too? Aiewe to learn
whether treaties are to be observed from the In-
dians? and it they are faithless, is it to be set up as
a plea for us to break treaties.? Was this a prin-
ciple for an American legislator to adopt He re-
pudiated the doctune, and hoped it one which
would never be adv anced here He was ready to
give every appropriation which might be necessary.
He was willing to give the people of Florida all
the relief which could be afforded them, and to go
as far m the lemoval of the Indians as he could do
with honor and justice, but he was not willing to
go against all honorable warfare, merel) because
they weie a sav age, and we a c iviiized people He
would suggest respectfully to the gentleman from
Virginia, whether it would not be judicious and
wise to lemove the only feature in the resolution,
which appeared to be a subject of debate He re-
ferred to that part in relation to the appom ment of
the committtee by ballot, and if the gentleman
• tonld not accept it as a modification, he would
move to strike out that pait of the resolution
Mi WISE hoped that the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts v ould not make the motion vhien he
h id sua ested, to stiike out that part m relate n to
the election of the commi tee He preferred the re-
solution going to the House in its present form, and
he flowed the gentleman would permit the question
to be taken m this shape He would merely re-
mark that, by the rules of the House, it was not
considered disrespectful to the Speaker to move to
have a committee elected, as this mode of election
was provided for by the rules The seventh rule
of the House provided that "all committees shall
be appointed bv the Speaker, unless otherwise spe-
cially du ected by the House, in which case they
shill be elected by ballot " It was therefoie contem-
plated by j oui rules that, withont disrespect to the
Speakei, the House could take this powei of appou t-
ment into its own hands He hoped this mode of ap-
pointment would be adopted for another reason,
and that was,that he did not w ish himself to be on
this committee, and ñora the universal custcim of
the House, if the appointment was made by the
Speaker, he would have to be the chairman of the
committee He knew the difficulty and labor at-
tending an investigation of this kind, and therefore
he did not wish to be placed upon this committee.
But, to be bold and candid, his mam reason for
w shmg this mode of appointment was the fact, that
let the disposition of the Speaker of the House be
ever so fan and ipnght, evei so just to tiuth and
the public interests, n was expected and required
of him, in these times, to give us a packed commit-
tee, and God knows he (Mr W ) had had bitter,
bitter experience en theae stocked committees of m-
ve tigatie n Sir, said Mr W let me tell you a
fact that this countiy is not informed of
which w ill serve as a specimen of what
one of these stocked committees will do.
D iring the last winter a committee was ap-
pointei to investigate the Executive Depaitments.
A íepoit was made bj the majority of thai com-
mittee, and will it be believed in Gath, that not one
pari c,e of that report was w ritten by a member
of that majority of the committee Some of the ma-
jority are here who weie on that committee, and Jet
any member of that majority here, rise 11 his place
and say who wrote it I tell you that it was
written by a scavenger—an antimasomc edi-
tor from Boston, who was brought here and
placed on that committee as a clerk by a member
