Brigadier General J. D. IMBODEN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have received your letter of the 31st ultimo, by Captain George W. Stumpt.

I think it very important, in the quiescent state of affairs in your department, to endeavor to drive the enemy from Hardy and hampshire Counties, and break up his position at Romney and Petersburg; but I am unable, at this time, to detach any portion of this army to your assistance. The enemy is reported to be again advancing toward the Rappahannock, and, until I can discover his intentions, I do not think it prudent to diminish my present force.
