Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The Second Division was withdrawn from its position covering the crossing of Hatcher's Run at Armstrong's Mill just before daylight this morning, and is now in position on the new intrenched line, its left resting on the Vaughan road. General Hartranft's division was directed to return to the Ninth Corps last evening. The infantry parapet of the new line assigned to Second Corps is completed; the slashing probably will be by night, as well as the batteries. I shall remove my headquarters this morning to a point between the Claypole and Hetch house, on the Squirrel Level road, about half a mile south of the former house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
