Reports of Major General Thomas C. Hindman, C. S. Army, commanding division.

ATLANTA, GA., October 22, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The report of my operations in McLemore's Cove on September 10 and 11 is forwarded herewith. Many calumnies have been circulated against me in connection with that affair. It has been my habit heretofore to disregard such misrepresentations, but in this country that silence is taken for a confession of misconduct, and an officer's reputation suffers accordingly. I therefore ask leave to publish the report at this time. As no injury to the service can result, I indulge the hope that this request will be granted without delay.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. C. HINDMAN,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, GA., October 25, 1863.

COLONEL: Between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of September 10, I moved with Anderson's, Deas', and Manigault's brigades from Lee and Gordon's Mills to Dr. Anderson's house, on the La Fayette road, and thence through Worthen's Gap, of Pigeon Mountain, toward Davis' Cross-Roads, in McLemore's Cove.

The instructions given me by the chief of staff at army headquarters were to unite at Davis' with Cleburne's division, of Hill's corps and attack a force of the enemy [thought to be 4,000 or 5,000 strong] "at the foot of Lookout Mountain at Stevens' Gap." [See Exhibit A.] I was advised that General Hill was to open communication with me before I should reach Davis.'
