JNO POPE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Louis, August 18, 1861.

Brigadier-General HURLBUT.

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to inform you that he has received a letter* from Mr. Hayward, of Hannibal, stating that the firing into the train occurred before the citizens had time to organize for the prevention of such outrages but that a meeting of the citizens had since been held and men sent out to see what could be done and asking that no steps should be taken until the result of this action of the people was ascertained. The general commanding directs me to say that if you think the citizens of Hannibal and Palmyra have taken hold of this matter in earnest and are likely to bring the offenders to justice you will give them a reasonable time to do so, but if you think they are not moving actively or if after a reasonable delay they fail to deliver up the assassins, you will proceed to collect the levy.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[C. A. MORGAN,]

Aide-de-Camp.
