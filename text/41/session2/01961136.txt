THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 9,
ity on this subject. Mr. Snow represents him,
in a letter which I have read, as primus inter
pares on the subject of the census. In these
statistics prepared by Dr. Hough he shows that
under the law of 1850 the expense of the
schedules would be $33,766 87: but if you omit 1
from the Housebillthehouseholders' schedules,
und let the enumeration be taken directly, the
expense of the schedules will be $13,312 40.
I ask that these detailed estimates may be
printed as a part of my remarks.
Estimate of blanks required for the ninth cen-
sus, under the bill passed by the House of
liepresentatives and now before the Senate; ■
by Franklin B, Hough.
In the New York Tribune of January 18, *
1870, among other items of congressional news
is one in which it is stated that Mr. Kennedy,
former Superintendent of the Census, has pre-
pared an approximate estimate of the cost of j
paper for some of the census schedules. It is I
as follows: j
"By the census bill now before the Senate Mr. !
Kennedy furnishes the data to show that the paper I
necessary for the population and agricultural sched- ;
ules, leaving the remainder of the eight out of the
question, will amount to more than twenty-three
thousand reams of folio-post, and cost $141,000, or
about sixfold the expense of all the schedules used i
for either of the two last censuses. Ho further i
declares that from seven to ten tons of daily mail .
accommodation for two months will be demanded for
tho distribution of schedules and instructions, but t
that all this enormous expense will prove but amere
bagatelle compared with the cost of printing the ,
results as required by the bill." j.
These estimates Mr. Kennedy authorized his ]j
friends to submit to experts for verification, j
Whether this communication be regarded as h
official or otherwise, its manifest object is to Ji
prejudice the prospects of the bill now before j
Congress providing for the taking of the ninth I
census. As the statements and conclusions
are untenable, their fallacy will readily appear
upon careful examination.
Basis of Estimate.
For this purpose we will assume that the
present population of the United States is forty
millions ; that the number of farms has in-
creased fifty per cent, and the number of man-
ufactories three hundred per cent. The num-
ber of trading and mercantile establishments
will be assumed as double that of manufacto-
ries. The paper will be estimated as of the
same size and weight as that used in 1860,
namely: 18X26 inches, weighing 30 pounds to
the ream of 480 sheets, and worth $6 52} per
ream at the present time, or at the rate of 21|
cents per pound, this being the price for which
paper was contracted for last year. The ton
will be understood as two thousand pounds.
The amount of paper actually used in making
one set of returns, where the blanks required
are of the same size, will be assumed to be the
same as that used in 1860 for an equal number
of names.
Blanks printed for census in 1850, and 1860.
As upon both of these occasions the blanks
for the census were printed under the direction
of Mr. Kennedy, it may be proper to place the
result in comparison with his recent estimate.
On page 6 of the quarto report of the census
of 1850 we are told that—
" Three thousand reams of medium paper, woighing
over one hundred tons, were required to print the
schedules of the census of1850, originals and copies."
In 1860 the quantity printed, according to
the books of the Government Printing Office,
was 2,554 reams. A memorandum filed in the
Census Office gives the amount as 2,925 reams;
but as this is not supported by the evidence on
the printer's books, the former, which is an
official statement, will be considered as the true
amount.
The population of the United States was
23,191,876 in 1850, and if assumed to be
40,000,000 at the present time, the gain of
Per cent, should be added to the above
official statement in order to ascertain how
many reams and tons of paper would now be
required under precisely similar circumstances
for the present population. "We find by add-
ing 72.5 per cent, to the 3,000 reams, or 100
tons, that there would be required, according
to this precedent, 5,175 reams, or 172.5 tons.
In 1860 we had 31,443,322 inhabitants, and
the increase (if now 40,000,000) has been 27.2
per cent. The 2,554 reams shown on the books
of the Public Printer would now be 3,248.69
reams or48.73 tons, or, accordingto the mem-
orandum above mentioned, 3,730.6 reams, or
55.81 tons; the conditions in everything except-
ing number of inhabitants being the same.
Estimate for population blanks for 1870.
The bill passed by the House, and now in
the Senate, directs that there shall be provided
a householder's schedule to be left with every
family within twenty days previous to the day
on which the enumeration is to begin, and that
it shall be filled up by the head of the family,
or other competent person, in readiness to
give to the enumerator when called for. It is
to contain the name of each person, and the
statistics concerning age, sex, color, &c., as
required by the law. At the foot of the same
blank is a narrow blank for returningthe names
of persons who have died in the family within
the last year, and certain items of information
concerning them. The householder's sched-
ule will be ruled for about twelve names, and
that of deaths for about three names. As col-
lected by the enumerators, they will be care-
fully examined, corrected, or filled, if ne-
cessary, and from time to time forwarded to
the census office for tabulation. One house-
holder's schedule willbe one quarter of a sheet
of paper, 18X26. The average number of
persons in a family is assumed as five. For
40,000,000 names 8,000,000 blanks would be
wanted, equal to 2,000,000 sheets, or 4,166f
reams, or 62J tons, upon the supposition that
none were lost, and of this more will presently
be said.
The blanks required for the copy will be for-
warded to thedistrictsuperintendents only, and
will be of folio size, one schedule to a page and
four pages to a sheet. Each page will hold at
least forty names when full. For the whole
population there would be strictly required
1,000,000 pages or about 520.8 reams; but in
practice it is always found that some pages will
be only partly filled. In 1860, 27,463,570 free
inhabitants required 444.6 reams for one set
of returns, or an average of about thirty-two
names to a page or one hundred and twenty-
eight to a sheet; a loss of twenty per cent.,
each page being ruled for forty names.
Where the copying is all done at one point
in a congressional district or territory, there
should be a saving in this kind of blank, and
parts of pages unfilled need only to occur at
the end of a town or ward. But for this esti-
mate, we will allow it to be as great as before,
and by the "single rule of three," namely,
27,463,570: 40,000,000:: 444.6: 647.5, we find
that we shall need 647.5 reams or 9.71 tons of
paper for this blank.
It has been suggested by some persons that
the householder's schedule could be used to
great advantage only in cities and large villages,
and that in thinly settled districts it would be
much more economical, and just as well, in the
correctness of the result, if the census were
taken as heretofore, by direct inquiry of the
census-takers. For the sake of estimate, let it
be assumed that one half of the whole popula-
tion, or 20,000,000, be thus returned, while
the other half are reported upon householders'
schedules. There would then be required:
Meant.
Of householders' schedules, for half.  2,083.33
Of large schedules, for half.  971.25
1850, directly by the census-takers, there would
beused for the original and one copy, according
to the experience of 1860, 19.4 tons.
It is to be allowed that acertain waste of blanks
will always occur; but under the plan proposed
by the bill passed by the House and now before
the Senate, it need not exceed ten per cent.
' The householders' schedules would of course
be left only at inhabited places, but some would
be lost or mislaid. Each enumerator would
need an over supply to preventthe risk of short
allowance, but those who finished their distri-
bution first might be instructedto return their
surplus to the district superintendent of their
districts for those who needed further supply.
The proposed plan, that provides for the pre-
paring of the copy by the district superintend-
ents, will only require an over supply to some
two hundred and sixty persons or less, and the
waste might, with careful management, be
readily kept within ten per cent, on each of
the schedules under estimate. We have, there-
fore, according to the preceding data, the fol-
lowing results, which may be stated in three
ways:
1. With householders' schedules everywhere
and one copy:
Reams. Tons.
Householders' schedules 4,583.33 68.75
Blanks for one copy  712.25 10.68
Total (including waste) 5,295.58 79.43
2. With householders' schedules for half the
population:
Beams. Tons.
Householders' schedules for half.. ..2,291.67 34.37
Large blanks for half and copy for
all 1,068.37 16.02
Total.
..3,360.04
50.23
3. With large blanks, and enumerating as
under the law of 1850, without using house-
holders' schedules:
Reams. Tons.
For the original and one copy 1,425.50 21.36
Total  3,054.58
equal to 45.82 tons, allowance being made for
the original and one copy.
If, however, the whole of the population
were enumerated as required under the law of
Estimate for blanks required for mortality
statistics in 1870.
The householders' schedule includes a blank
for deaths, to be printed on the same sheet, and
this will, therefore, not increase the cost of
blanks as already estimated. To be copied, a
blank containing the prescribed heading will
extend across one page; the page will have
forty lines, and one hundred and sixty names
may be entered on one sheet. But allow that
ten lines may, on an average, be blank on
every page, we shall have one hundred and
twenty names to the sheet; an allowance that
may be justly claimed under the bill, although
the experience of 1860 gave but sixty-two names
to a sheet. The number of deaths reported in
1850 was 323,023, and in 1860, 394,153, a
number much below the truth, and from the
crude method of reporting so long after the
death, as would happen in many cases, the
method then used was liable to involve mani-
fold errors and discrepancies, which could
neither be reconciled nor justified. In 1860
13.1 reams were required for one set of returns.
Allow for the present estimate twice the num-
ber of deaths as a nearer approximation, and
the quantity, upon the data above given, will
be 13.7 reams. With ten per cent, for waste,
it would need 15.07 reams, or .27 tons of
paper. If one half of the population were
reported upon householders' schedules, and the
remainder in the old way, the blanks for deaths
would require 30.69 reams, or 0.46 tons. If
reported in the manner required under the law
of 1850, a double set of half-sheets would be
required to each of 15,000 enumerators, and
for the copyes as before, namely:
Reams. Tons
For enumerators    31.25 0.47
For the copy  15.07 0,23
Total  46.32 .70
