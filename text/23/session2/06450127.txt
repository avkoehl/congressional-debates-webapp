AiOUGH, as to the effect of ihe motion, it was

' o   the former appiopr ation, §75,000 "
Mi E gave the reasons whi^h induced the call

by repitsent tg the tmpmtance of the repairs con-
emolated He said there was not now a single
piece of ordnanc  whi"h could be btought to bear,
in Bos ot hai-boi The appiopnation of $8,000,
