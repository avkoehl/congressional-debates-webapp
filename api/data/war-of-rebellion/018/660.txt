marched back to Kelly's Ford last night, for Morell just reported that none of Pope's troops were either at Kelly's Ford or Rappahannock Station.

Porter will look to those places this morning.

GE. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 25, 1862-9.45 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

It now appears that General Reno was not at Kelly's Ford yesterday, nor was there anything of General Pope's there or at Rappahannock Station, except some few cavalry, yesterday or to-day. You may regard this as certain. I learn that Kearny's pickets are at Bealeton.

General Sumner was detained by a gale. His troops cannot be here until to-morrow. General Porter now occupied Kelly's Ford and all below it. He reports the river fordable for infantry and cavalry almost anywhere.

In view of Sumner's delay and the state of the river I propose that Kearny should occupy Rappahannock, General Porter to remain where he is until Sumner comes up to relieve him. If this is not right, inform me at once and I will direct as you wish. I propose this as the best way of defending the Lower Rappahannock, and as I am still, like yourself, ignorant of General Pope's position in detail. I am ready at a moment's notice to push General Porter forward to Rappahannock Station, if you think the lower river in no danger and wish to throw Heintzelman's farther to the right.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have been over all the ground near here with Burnside and find all right. Sumner not yet arrived. Do you still wish him to land here, and do you wish me here or at Alexandria? I await the expression of your wishes as to where I can be of most use to you at present. I do not see that I can do anything here.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 25, 1862-10 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

It is confirmed that General Reno has not been at Kelly's Ford for three days. General Banks is not near Bealeton, but Kearny's pickets are there. We do not know where General Reno or Banks is. Reynolds was at Warrenton this afternoon. Please answer my last telegraph as soon as possible.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
