importance which we can bring into the account
I have alluded more full}, a few days ¡since, in
another debate, to the correspondence of Lord
Palmerston with our Government, recently pub
hshed, in which the Bntish Government solemn-
ly announce to us that they will not heieafter rec-
ognize any indemnity as due us fiom the de-
struction of oiu propeity in slaves, no mattei under
what cncumstances they may fall under Bntish
dominion This decision of that Govern ment ha3
been made m relation to thiee vessels driven by
stress of weather on the Bahamas, bound ftom
Alexandria to New Oileanswith slaves belonging
to our citizens They make a distinction between
the cases oecuinng previous to the Bntish act of
emancipation, passed for their West India islands,
and those occurring since that act They thus
íecognize indemnity as due in the oncease, under
the law of nations, and refuse in the othei be-
cause, forsooth, their municipal íegulatton, as
embodied in their act of emancipation, has upon
that point abrogated the law of nations Their
own civil authorities upon the island, immediately
after the vessel was driven in by the " act of
God," seized upon the slaves, and foiced them
to accept their liberation, and refused possession
to then owners, and yet the British Government
solemnly icfuse to us indemnity, and perempto-
rily announce to us that they will not hereafter
recognize, undei any circumstances, the right of
property in persons it is impossible to conceive
ofamoie direct blow at our independence It
assumes the i ight in the Bi itish Govei nment to de-
clare to us in what our propeity shall not consist,
and, by consequence, in what it shall consist
The whole coriespondence shows the influence
of O'Connellupon a weak cabinet But I foibear
to press this matter, and will only say, that rather
than submit to this an ogant assumption of power
by Great Butain, carried into full effect, I would
piefer to see that noble country stretching itsi If
fiom the Patapsco to the Sabine a howling wil-
derness, or wrapt in conflugiation

Ik («, in, this n a question in which northern
lights aie peculiarly involved, and although we
have be< n tieated ciuelly and unkindly by 1 poi-
tion of that section ot the Union although they
have agitated a lüal question, and made war upon
out dearest rights and upon oui domestic peace,
yet I am willing, foi the moment, to bury all that
in ohlmon, and to look alone to the lights and
the honor of a common country Oui blood and
treasute have been ofTeiod up beloie in a war
waged peculiarly for northern rights, and we will
be prepared again to do our duty, if needs be,
without calculation as to cost
In times that have recently passed, the State
which I have the honor, in part, to represent, has
been traduced and slandered by those who ought
to have felt for us the common sympathy of
brothers. There are those who have coutted
opulanty by singling us out for denunciation,
y way of illustrating their own peculiar patnot-
ism Yes, sir, South Carolina has been unkindly
treated, but her star still twinkles above the hori-
zon, her banner is in the breeze, aMd, thank
God, there never has yet been a stain upon it;
and now let the first tap of the war drum be heard
on the remote confines of either extreme of this
Union, and you will find her sons in the front
ranks, with no other emotions beating in their
hearts but for the glory and the triumph of a united
and a common country
PUBLIC LANDS
SPEECH OF HON. J. ROBERTSON,
OF VIRGINIA,
In the House of Representatives,
rebruary 7, 1839,
On the amendment proposed by htm to the report of the
Select Committee on the Public Lands
Mr JOHNSON, ot Maryland, from the select
committee to which the subject had been referred,
havtng submitted the following leport
Rcsolvel, That the committee report to the Home, and
ask leave to be discharged from the further consideiation

uCthe c jiiiunllet beiipnt d utd published
Uesol el fi Iher I h it the committee deem it me pedí
et t to t ike further steps, on the subject of the public lands
this session
Mr ROBERTSON said that he had concuired
with the committee in the resolution asking to be
dischtuged From the known diveiMly ot opin-
ion existing among its membeis, he was satisfied
fiom the fiist that it would adopt no measure
which could be pioposed No one, he imagined,
was disappointed at the result of its labois In
doing nothing, it had peitoimed its appointed
woik, it had fulfilled its destiny, and, foi him-
self, he was grateful that it had done nothing
woise
But I did not concur, sit, (continued Mi R ,)
in the lesolution declaung it inexpedient to legis-
late upon the subject dining the present session
I   am not satisfied that this important question
shall be thus put aside without one moie etToit,
at least, to procure the action of the House upon
it, and my put pose, in rising, was to move a
recommitment to the same committee, or to the
standing Committee on Public Lands, with in-
structions to report the joint resolution I now
send to the Chair I should prefei, however, sir,
if in order, to oifir the r<solution as a substitute
for those of the committee, so as to supersede the
foi mality of a recommitment, and bring the ques-
tion directly before the lloust
The SPLAKI.R said, it would be in order to
move to stnke out all aftei the word "íesolved,"
and to inseit the joint lesolution pioposed by the
I gentleman fiom Vnjinia
Mr UOBERTfaON accordingly moved to strike
out, and inseit the following joint lesolution,
wlneh was lead by the Ckik

or shall he hereafter, conferred on particular btates, to ex
tend as firns practicable in each and all the Mates, m their
due and ju t proportions, who may require or be willing to
accept them, similar benefits upon the same or equivalent
terms
Mr DUNN moved to amend the amendment
of Mi RoBEitTSON, by inserting before the fiist
proviso—
Fir=t paym? to the States in v. Inch such lands are situate
twelve and a half per cent of the proceeds of public lands
sold within such States respectively
Mr ROBERTSON said The object, sir, of the
joint resolution I have ventuied to present is to
carry into effect the compacts between theongmal
States of this Union, by distributing among all
the States the future proceeds of the sales of the
public domain in the proportions stipulated by
these compacts   A proposition on its face so rea- I
sonable would seem to require no argument or
persuasion to insure its adoption But every sim-
ilar one has been hitherto unsuccessful, and this,
I am well assured, will be strenuously opposed.
I avail myself, therefore, sir, of the oppoitunity
now affoided me—the last, perhaps, I might ever
enjoy—of addressing the House in its defense I
shall endeavor to maintain that the measure pro-
posed is within the plain limits of our constitu-
tional power, that the distribution it contemplates
is not only mtrinsicallyjust, but is in conformity
with compacts as solemn as any ever entered into
among nations, and whose obhgatoiy character
is recognized by the Fedeial Constitution itself,
and by Federal legislation both before and since
that Constitution was adopted, that it has received
the explicit sanction of a laige majority of the
States, and, indeed, dnectly or indirectly, of evei y
State in the Union In othei woids, sir, I hope
to move that the measuie is both constitutional
and expedient, or,m the language of the late Chief
Magistrate, safe, just, and fedeial
It is not my intention to enter into an examin-
ation of the original title to what is now called
the publicdomnin, because I desire, as far as prac-
ticable, to avoid lirelevant discussions Whatever
doubts oi difficulties existed on this point during
the i evolutionary war or pievious to it, they weie
closed and lemoved by the Aitnles of Confeder-
ation,* by the compacts of cession, and by the
Constitution, and, if it were not so, the discus-
sion would still be unprofitable, for no prefeience
is asked foi the old btates, the original piopue-
tors of the whole, and by whatever title this Gov-
ernment now holds, whethei by cession, pur-
chase, oi conquest, none can deny their title to a
just paiticipation I pioceed at once, therefoie,
to the onginal compacts which he at the founda-
tion of the question A brief íefei ence to a single
clause in one of them—the most important of
them all, that of Vnginia—will be sufhcient for
my present purpose It is the often-quoted clause
which, coming after the provisions setting apart
mconsideiiible portions of the vast territory sur-
rendered, dcclaies

I will not repeat the commentaries made on
this clau&e in almost e\ciy discussion which has
occurred on the subject of the public lands foi ten
ycais past But 1 beg you, sn, for a moment,
to call to mind the condition of our country when
this sokmn tt msfer of tule was made and ac-
cepted AConfcdeiacy of States, each retaining
absolute sovt leignty, united by a league—as it
was foicibly e\pitsstd,a rope of sand—no closer
union at the time anticipated nordesned The
wai of independence had but just teimmated,
luu mg ns involved in a heavy debt, and without
available rcsouices Some of the States held or
cl timed an extent of leu itory stietching fiom the
Atlantic to the Pacific Others, less fortunately
circumstanced, íegaided these extensive posses-
sions as dangeious to their future peace, they
urged that they had contributed their blood and
tieasure to acquire and defend them, and they
insisted on a liberal surrender The proposition
was acceded to New York led the way in 1781,
Vnginia followed, and, on the 1st of March,
1784, ceded the extensive region claimed by her
noithwest of the Ohio In this cession she stip
ulated that the territory should be laid out into
States, to be admitted into the Union with the
same rights of sovereignty, freedom, and inde-
pendence, as the other States, that certain por-
tions of it should be reserved for specific pur-
poses, and the residue (as declared in the clause
just quoted) constitute a common fund for the
use and benefit of all the States, m specified pro-
portions.   The payment of the public debt was

State shall be depuvedof territory for the benefit of the
United States
