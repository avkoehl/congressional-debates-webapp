Ins anxiety to speak, and felt a friendly disposition to giatiiy
him If I were sui prised when I heaid him h iw into the \or

this subject, what must have been my icelmg3 when I htaid
him denounct the institutions of the N >rth as meicenaiy md
slavish, and exalt those ol the South as ancient, pitnaichd,
and almobt pptfeet, boldly avow that the hiboiers oi the Noiih
were the subjects of the Northern capitalists put the North

threaten to preach insurrection to the laboréis of the North'1

[M- Pickens explained, and said, in substance, that he had
spoken only of the tendency of Noithern institutions to make
thev-oikiug men of the North tributary to the capitalist, and
to prevent them from rising ftom their labanous situation
That he had not degraded them into a comparison with the
laves, b it h id said that if the people of the Noith would con
untie tomtpifete with the slaves of the South, then he (Mr
Picked) would preach m&uriection to the Northern laboieis J
Mi Nayloríesumed, and said, I have not misunderstood
the honoiabic gentleman That thehonoiabte gentleman doe&
tieat the Northern workmen as Southern slaves i evident from
whit he had just sud If he had not intended io place them in
the hamo degraded situation of slaves, how could he thieaten to
pieich insui rertion among them1 Sir, the honorable gen
tleman has mistaken the tendency of Noithern institutions, as
much as he his misconceived the woith and spirit of Noithem
ohai ictei Oui institutions have no such tendoncy, no, sn,
but ex telly the icvetse They raise up the laborer They
¡ I ice cveiy man upon an equality They give to all equal
lights and equal chaneeb, and hojd out to all equal induce
menls to iction Noithern institutions tend to keep down the
Nor hern laboréis' The whole Imtoiy of the North, from the
landing of the fust pilgum on the rock of Plymouth to this
horn, cotitiadicts this position
I appcil to the ícpiespntativeb from Pennsylvania I ask
vou bits, who i1- Joseph Ritner, that distinguished man, who at
thisvety moment fills th*- executive rhait of yeui gteat State,
a man who in ill that constitutes high moral and intellectual
woith, has lew supenois in this country—one w' o ha* all the
qualities of held and heart necessary to accomplish the great
state man and who po^esses, in the most enlaigetl degree, all
the elfc-mcnts of human gieatness—who, sirs, is he * A Northern
laboicr—a Pennsylvania wagsnei—who for yeais drove his

ovei the mooi," not "whist'ing as he went"—no, sn, but pre

wilh istonifahme it Some of them have gone forth from then
homes, become draughtcis and signers of declarations of inde
pendence, founders ol new empnes, hiealeers of the chains of
de&poiterj ,and the earth, even in then youth, hasdtunk up
their blootl, bhed willingly in the cause of the rights of man
Some nave minis eied to the altai of their Divine Master Some
have led the bar, adorned the Senate, illustrated the judiciary,
and others have wan lered in the flow cry fields of literature, trod
in the cool tranquilh/mg paths of philosophy, delved in the
depths of science, and compassed the world with their enter
prise In a word, civilisation Ins no pursuit that they have not
already honoied and adorned And yet these men are some of
the fruits of those odious institutions against which ti e eloquent
gentleman has attempted his ciusade
Sir, it 13 the glory of the Noithem institutions that they give
to every man, pooi and nch, high and low, the same fan play
They place the honois, emoluments, ¿nd distinctions of the
country before him, and say, "go run youi race for the prize,
the ieward shall encade the br w of the most worthy " Thus
it u that every one feels and knows that he has a clear held
before him, and that with industry, piuetence. and perseverance,
he cancommand success many honoralle undertaking He
knows that his industry is his oicn, his effoits are his own, and
that every bl< w he stuices, whil&t it ledound&lo his own mime
diiteadvm a2e, contnbutpsalso to ÚV good of the community,
and thegloiy and ienown of his countiy All honorable em
ployments aie open to him The halls of legislation are open to
him, th"bar i=< open to him, the fields of science are befoie him,
there is no baniei between him and the object of his ambition,
but such as industry and peiseveiance may overcome
look at the workings of then institutions upon the appear
anee of the Noith    Look at hei mighty cities, hei forests of
masts, her smiling villages, her fertile fiells, hei productive
mine*, her numerous chanties, hei  ten thousand improvp
snents     Behold my own   my nitive State     Pennsylvania is
intellectuahzed under their auspices    Hei soils and hills, and
valleys, and rocks, and everi istmg mountain-* live and breathe
undei the animating influence   of hei  it telhgent ¿nd hard
working population, eveiy stieam feeds its canal, every sec
tion oí countiy has its laibocd, distance is annihilated, the
flmty  libs of  hei   locky mouiituns die liven   asunder,   the
bowels of the eaith yield loilh their treasuieb, and the Íao, of
the earth blooms and blossoms  and fructifies like a paradise
And all il is, all this is the result ot the intelligence, industry,
and enterprise of Noithern laboréis, fostcicd by the genial
influence of their institutions
Nor ue their efforts confined to tins own countiy alone
Then industry and enterpu&e compa&s the whole earth
There is not a wave undei Heaven that thfir kepis have not
paited, not a breeze evet stirred to which they have not un
Juiled the tetany bannei of tin country Go to the frozen
ocean of the North, and you will find them theie, to the ocean
m the extieme South, and vou will find them there Nature
has no difficulty that they have not oveicome—the woild no
limit that they have not attained
In eveiy depaiimcnt of mind do the institutions wf the
Noith e\f it a wholesome, a developing in^utnce Sir, it was
but i ew d ly sjii e >ou atw tin m mbei-3 of this House ga
tht rea around the eleuro magnetic machine of Mr Davenpoit
There they stood mute and motionless, beholding, foi the fitst
time, the becret, sublime, and mysterious principles of Nature
ipplied to mechanics, and theie was the machine, visible to
all eyes, moving with theiapidity of lightning without anv
apparent cause But the genius that made the application of
this sublime and mystenous influence, who is he butalabonug,
haul woikmg blacksmith of the Noith1
Sir, wheiedo learning, literatuie and science flourish, but in
the Nurthi Where does the press teem with the pioducts of
mind, but in the Norths Wheie aie the scientific institutions,
the immense libraries, nvailing almost at this eaily day Eu
rope's vast accumulations, but in the Noith¡ And who, sn,
gives foim and giace, and life and proportion, to the shapi.le&&
marble,but theseulptor of the Noith? Yes, sir, and there, too,
does the genius of the pencil contribute hei glowing creations
to the stock of N<>nbein icnown To Northern handiwork
are you indebted for the magmficenee of this mighty Capitol
And tho-,e noble histoncal jueces now filling the panels of
the Rotundo which display the beginning, piogiess, and
consummation of your Revolution, and give to all postenty
the living founs tnd bieathine countenanus of the fathers of
youi Republic—they, too are the works of a Noithern artist'
But befoie I conclude thismauch of my subject, let me make
one obocivation th it I had ilmost fo gotten The gentleman
seems to think that oui woikmen mu t of necessity be the pas
bivenisirumenis of our capitalists If is idea of the powei and
influence of wealth, controlling the very de^tinied of the man
who labois, must bedenvel i torn the institutions of his own
generous ¡South, where he fruskly avows that the capitalist
doeb absolutely own the laborers His views are, howevu, uf
terly inapplicable to the Noi th W ho are the Northern t a pi
talists of to day, but the pennylesb appientices of yesteiday?
Sn, m the North theie is Mraicely a class of men existing ex
olusively as c iptt tlists The ch iracter of capitalist and labor
er is there united in the same peison in ninety nine cares
out of a hundied be who is a capitalist has become so by his
own industry and perscverencc He begins as an humble "la
boier"—his industry, virtue and integrity his onlv capital He
Gradually icctimulate<= Every day oftoilincieases his means
His means ate then united to his hiboi, and he ícceives the
I list and honest profils of them both Phu^ he f?oe<=on joining
his accumulations with his labor, recenmg the profits of
his capital and his toil scatteiing the fruits of his elfoits abroad
foi the benefit of society living in manly independence, and
laying up a stock of comfort and enioyment foi his declm ng
years Such was the rich Girard, thp ' merchant and man
ner," ashes-tyles himself in his list will lie besan his career
a destitute cabin boy And such are the capitalists all ovei the
North They were all laborers some few years since, ard the
humble operative of to day mu^tand will b*1 the wealthy capí
tahst in some few ye^rs tocóme andsofai aietheir titnuonsof
the Noiihfrom reta'ding his adrante, th t they encourage him,
aidbim, cheer, chen h md sustain him in h * onward career
But, sir there i3no linn' to this «object I will pursue it no
farther I might easily exhaust im°elf but the subject is m
exhaustible What I have said has b«en « ud to vindi ate the
chaiai'erof my constituents fit in mijiiot attacks, and to re
lipve the institutions of the North from the burden of denuncia
tion whuh has been so profusely heaped upon them I have
uttered nothing m a spirit of rii-aiangementto the South No,
Heaven forbid' lam incapable of it The whole country is
