hundred and nineteenth U. S. Colored Infantry, under Captain H. H. Hadley, of that regiment. About twenty mules and as many horses were picked up, and about twenty-five rebels were found along the road who had abandoned the rebel cause and gave themselves up. Colonel Windes effected his escape; under what circumstances I have not yet fully learned. Roddey has about 1,000 conscripts under him, with headquarters at Mount Hope, fifteen miles northeast of Russellville. No other force is believed to be anywhere in the vicinity or this side of Canton, where Forrest is supposed to be. Stewart's and Chalmers' commands have been transferred from the Army of the Mississippi to Charleston. As soon as Major Schnitzer, the officer who commanded the expedition, makes his report, I will forward the result of the expedition. I neglected to say in the proper place that two caissons were found this side of Tuscumbia and burned, and that forage was found sufficiently plentiful to supply the wants of the command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. R. STEWART,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Eastport, Miss., February 24, 1865.

MAJOR: I have the honor herewith to transmit report of Major Gustavus Schnitzer, Second Iowa Cavalry, who had command of the reconnaissance sent from these headquarters February 19, and which returned yesterday evening. I would most respectfully call your attention to the statement of Major Schnitzer in regard to the ability of 500 well-mounted men passing over the country hereabouts without risk. I would also call your attention to the papers* captured with the rebel Lieutenant-Colonel Windes, and especially to those contained in the envelope marked "important." If Major George is to muster his men near Iuka on the 28th of February I believe the whole party could be captured, and I would respectfully request permission to act in regard to him as circumstances may direct. The probability is that no paymaster will venture near Iuka with $ 75,000 Confederate money since Lieutenant-Colonel Windes deserted, leaving this information in our hands. My scouts will be directed to watch this fellow George, and I desire to prevent any muster on the 28th of February near our lines. By the boats just arrived I learn that Charleston, S. C., is in our hands. I have learned no details of the capture.

With highest respect, I am, your obedient servant,

R. R. STEWART,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Asst. Adjt. General, Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi.

(Through Brigadier-General Croxton, commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi.)
