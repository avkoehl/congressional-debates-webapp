HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 10, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

Instead of a greater detour, could not the present left of Fourteenth Corps (with cavalry to Proctor's Creek) form a good flank, throwing the rest of the army to right of Schofield's rapidly? Green's Ferry and Sandtown, and perhaps Turner's Ferry, roads could be kept open. Such an extension must bring the enemy out of Atlanta. I mean the above with other dispositions as you proposed to-day. It is possible the works being so strong, that the cavalry could hold the present lines of the Fourth Corps, so as to move that over without difficulty.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 10, 1864.

General HOWARD:

I thank you for the suggestion. I am studying all the combinations possible and beg you to think also, and communicate to me, but be careful to keep your own confidence. I spoke of the same thing to-day to General Thomas, and he goes to look at the railroad bridge to see to a proper cover there for the wagons and a corps. I want to expend 4,000 heavy rifle-shots on the town before doing anything new, and then will be prepared to act quick. General Schofield has been reconnoitering the right all day, and after he has answered a few more of my questions I will give you the substance of his report.

General HOWARD:

Can't you get in your 20-pounders to-night in General Corse's battery and put them to work? The moon gives light enough, and night is better than day for artillery. General Brannan has three 4 1/2-inch guns in General Geary's battery, and one on General Williams' right.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,August 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My battery on Corse's left is completed and I will put in the guns in the morning. This position and the one on Williams' right are the best for damaging the town I have seen.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
