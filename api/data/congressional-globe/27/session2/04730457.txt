not had the time But this committee, by taking such a step
aa they have done, ask the House to pass a censure on the
President
Mr. TRIPLETT Will the gentleman allow me to ask him
one question?
The SPEAKER     Does the gentleman from New York
yield the floor?
Mr ROOSEVELT    Certainly
Mr TKIPLETT Can the gentleman from New York, [Mr
Roosbvelt ] or any other gentleman fríen l'y to the President,
answer for him that it is his intention to communicate this
document to the House within any reasonable time*1
Mr ROOSEVELT I am nut tbe keepei of the President s
conscience—[a voice, "lie talk* about the President's con
science'"]—nor have I communicated with him for weeks past
But ought this House to censure him for not having read a doc
ument of 400 folio pases in eight days? For not having read,
marked, learned, and inwardly digested all Its voluminous con
tente—and this at a time when the most important foreign ne
gotiations were in progiess? Mr R would appeal to all sides
of the party triangle m this House whether such a censure was
fairly deserved?
Mr W ( OST JOHNSON declared his purpose to vote for
the reconsideration as an act of justice to the President, to
the board of commissioners, and all other parties connected
with this affair The Piesident had at an early day duected
the board of cummissioneis to close then investigation and
make their report, two of them hid done so but a third had
lingered m New York ar-d not given in his íeport till the 12hof
April It had afterwards been withdrawn, and not given m
again till the 20th It was the report of one member of the
board only, had not been examined, or so much as seen by the
others, while, at the same time, it did happen that this one
commissioner had strong prejudices against a large portion of
the manufacturing and commercial mteiesisof this countiy
Add to this the report, if h> rightly understood wis wholly
unaccompanied with any portion of the evidence on which v
was founded If thrown before the House in th 13 state, might
it not do great injustice? A mere exaarte paper like this oufeht
not to be pointed till the House had the whole belore them As
to the alleged apprehension that the Pusident would not corn
mumcate the document to the Hou « or at least not entire le
must know that acopy was in the hards oí a committee, and
his refusal wouM bring him befoie the bai oí public opinion
Mr. J said that he personally 1 new—not from the ^resident, but
from sources perrc.nly to h relied on—that the President had
long been anxious to have this New \o k commission clos>d
Mr"j dwelt on the impotence of having the testimony accom
pany the rcpott 1 he President had been mo*t desnousof
Uying the who's subject before toe Hon e but had been
prevented fiom doing so by ti e deh¿ in obtaining this pres

Abird m the hand was woith two in the bush he wanted tbe

Mi  WISE went into a recapitulation of the facts in the Ins

had been appointed, and, on their re^ommendat on Mr fetew

Mr W then took up and commen'el on theieportof th°
Committee on Ex enriiruu inqumn" how ti ey k íew the 1

Mr COOPER The gentleman does not understand me as
defending thi practice for a moment
Mr WI&E Not at all He then proceeded to inquire
who was George Pointdexter? And after passing high com
pliments on his in ellig^nce and standing, his feaiies^ness and
independence anda'mumg he had teen among the leading
members in the ^enate and the Ajax of legislation m 1 is own
State, mfe red Irom the whole that he must well know toe course
of the commirteeto be an abuse, and, if now on the fl 101 of the
Senate, would be the list man to justify it Mr W did not
know which was the most reprehensible—the conduct of the
committee, or the conduct of thePie=ndent ssuboidmate The
committee had no business with the document It was a mat
ter between the House of Repiesen atives and the Secretary of
the Tieabiiry The House had taken it in it¡> own liando arid
that at the instance of tins coinmutee itself and hut for the df
lay occasioned hy this very commissioner himself, th*- m

would not, perhaps, be decorous fjr Mr W to inquue, wh 1c

involved the chaiactei of the custom house officers at New-

dexstood some of them to be ami tariff Whigs, and others pro
tariff Whigs) and ultimately every member here representing
the btateof Massachusetts This repoit, gentlemen might be
assured had deeper ends in view than a mere reform of abuses

Mr SIANLY said he was not in the least surprised at the
strenuous opposition of gentlemen to the punting of true ra
port    He had expected that the honorable gentlemen who rep-
resented the dist 11 t ofthesamted Butlei andof the immaculate
Hoyt, (whom Mi  Van Burén ke,it in ofMce after the report of
an investigating committee had shown his defalcations ) would
be desnous of taking care of those very pious and exemplary
peisona he had expected too, that the cow hoy party would be
e lually anxious to take care of then conscie itious Piesident
Ail this w s to have been expected, and from  the intimate
