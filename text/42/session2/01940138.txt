APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 15,
Senate.
The Tariff—Mr. Scott.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
our cheap land enables us to raise grains at a
low rate, and with our wheat we ought to pay
for all other products we need at the prices
that cheap labor in Europe will give them to
us."
Who agrees to these propositions? I deny
the soundness of the position. I affirm that
the true interest of our country requires that
we should manufacture all articles that we
have the natural facilities for producing, that
the labor employed should be well paid, and
that we should place such a duty on foreign
manufactures coming in competition with our
own as will prevent them from driving our
own out of the market, thereby depriving the
American laborer of remunerative employ-
ment.
I do not stop here to repeat the arguments
about the home markets that are furnished by
domestic manufactories, the advantages of a
diversified industry, the effect of competition,
the national independence and security in case
of war, the effect of sending abroad annually
for foreign products more bullion than our
mines produce, and the numerous questions
that at once suggest themselves and that have
become so familiar to the American people by
discussion from the time of Hamilton's report
in 1791, down to the present hour. All these
have often been treated as if they concerned
the capitalists alone, and the proprietors of
mills and forges have been thrust into the fore-
ground as the only interested persons. There
are but a few of those interested, and their
interest is not so great as that of the laborer,
as has been abundantly shown and testified be-
fore the Finance Committee.
Let us look for a moment at the difference
between American and European wages. That
I may not quote entirely from sources that
may be charged with protective leanings, I
insert here a table compiled from the report
of Hon. D. A. Wells, special Commissioner of
the Revenue, for 1868:
Excess of xoages paid laborers in the United States in
1867 over those paid same laborers in Great Britain
in 1866.
Ship-builders 47.58
Paper-mills -. 93.
Silk hats 80.
Glass-works  45.
Leather  48.
Gas-works  62.
Saws 07.52
Fire-arms 56.
Edge tools 50.
Hardware   40.
Fouuderies  57.
Rolling-mills  48.34
Sugar-refineries  65.
Worsted  58.
Woolen-mills    24.63
Cotton-mills 47.
Average on sixteen occupations, 55.56 per cent.
Thus it will be seen that there was an aver-
age of 55.56 per cent, of excess paid to the
same classes of laborers in this country in 1867
over what was paid in 1866 in Great Britain to
the same classes.
From the same report I take the average
duties paid on imports for the years ranging
from 1861 to 1868, as follows :
186 2 26.70
186 3 33.20
186 4 37.20
186 5 43.70
186 6 47.06
186 7 47.31
186 8 .; 47.86
288.06
Average duty 40.43 per cent.
Thus showing that the average duties upon
imports in this country from 18G2 to 1868 were
bat 40.43 per cent., "while "we paid an excess
of 55.56 of wages to our laborers over those
of Great Britain.
Mr. MORTON. I ask the Senator if he
has any estimate, in connection with that prop-
osition, of the cost of transportation?
Mr. SCOTT. I have not an estimate of the
cost of transportation, for the reason that that
would vary on each separate product^ depend-
ing upon bulk, weight, &c., and I suppose it
would be very difficu-lt to get.
I have here also a table compiled by tho
Bureau of Statistics in 1870, showing the com-
parative rate of wages per week of persons
employed in various occupations in the Uni-
ted States, Great Britain, Prussia, Saxony,
Switzerland, and Belgium, as follows:
Comparative rates of wages per week paid to persons employed in various occupations in the following countries, {the rates being given in United
States gold dollars.)
