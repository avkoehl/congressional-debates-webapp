Company E. They found it to be our vedettes firing on some rebel cavalry, who had come within range, and upon receiving their fire retreated. Our party followed them, and, after proceeding within 2 miles of Woodbury, came upon the enemy's pickets, driving them in. At this time they discovered a party of the enemy charging on them in their rear. Lieutenant Clark, who was in command of the rear, immediately wheeled his men, and poured into them, from his carbines, a galling fire, and then drew sabers and charged them in fine style, scattering them in all directions, killing 2, wounding 1, and taking 10 prisoners, with no loss on our side except 2 horses wounded. The enemy was not in force in front and on the flanks. A retreat was ordered, the prisoners being sent forward under a guard; the party was divided equally, each lieutenant taking command of a party. One formed a line and held the enemy in check, while the other fell back, and vice versa, by which means they succeeded in bringing their prisoners in without loss. The enemy followed to the pickets,and quite a skirmish ensued, without loss on our side.

Permit me to offer a suggestion. Morgan's brigade is scattered from McMinnville to Woodbury, one and two regiments in a place. Now, in my opinion, with an adequate force of cavalry, and probably some artillery, his command could be taken in detail and routed completely.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. D. McCLELLAND,

Captain, Comdg. Second Battalion, Third Ohio Cavalry.

Lieut. Co. D. A. MURRAY,

Commanding Third Ohio Cavalry.
