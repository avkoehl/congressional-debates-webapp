25th CoNG....lst Sess.                                  Making public officers dfpositories—Mr. Garland.                                          H. of Reps.
was not to commence until the 1st day of Januaiy
a'fer its paSjagt, a period of six months, and then
to be met in íoui equal quarterly instalment1; This
was ample time to prevent anv serious derangement
of the affairs of the banks, or the commerce of the
country In a short time after the passage of this
act, and long before it was ascertained what would
be the amount to be distributed, and oí couise the
first instalment, the Secretary ol the Treasury is-
sued hisorders to the deposite banks, directing them,
by a fixed period, to transfer to specified points,
about $13,0J0,O0O, (as well as I recollect,) instead
of giving diafts to the States fot thni sciei til quotas
on tlie most convenient banks to pay the amount on the
day it was due, which might have been met, accord-
ing to the Usual mode of commercial exchange, be
tween creditor and deb or banks, and meichants,
and by which they would have been performing but
the usual commercial functions, whereas, by the op
erahon of the oí deis of the Ti easui y Depai tment, the
amount to be transferred %as abstracted ji om conime? -
cial employment,//om the tunc of the transfer till the
payment, and cieated a demand, m some instances,
for specie, w hich might have been avoided Thus
was inflicted upon eommeice an injury from the in
judicious execution of the lav., w hich is dexterously
ascribed to the provisions oí the law itself This
operation was particularly severe upon the New
York banks, which held in the neighborhood of
$20,000,000 of the public deposites The deposite
act in itself did not necessarily decrease, or tend to
decrease, the active capital of the country, it was
taken from banks to be again put into banks While
it reduced the active means of some, it mcieased
that of others In many instances the credit was
only passed from the Federal to the State Gov era
ments There was no'hing in it to embairass the
trade and commerce of the country The effect
was produced by its unwise execution, coming in
aid of other causes of an embarrassing character
In this opinion I am sustained by the most able and
skilful finan <ieis of the country
At about the time of tne suspension 0/ specie pay
ments, there weie in the banks, (if my estimate be
correct,) about $155,000,000 of private deposites
These private deposite  were generally made in
bank notes, yet the depositors had the right to do
mand specie for them When the operation of these
causes were perceived, and the diminution of con
fidence on the part of the Government manifest, the
private depositors, in place of their deposited notes,
began to demand specie Brokers also began to de
mand specie fcr all the notes which they held, or
could 1 urchase, and this w as no small amount
The banks m the city of New Yoik, where the
storm first began to rage and to produce most se-
rious effects, although ultimately responsible for all
their obligations, could not meet this sudden rush
upon their vaults, without rum to themselves, and
the people, thev therefore suspended specie pay-
ments This suspension, the causes of which were
not understood by the country, produced alarm
throughout the whole community, and a general
suspension of specie payments was the result Bv
this suspension I do not doubt that the banks have
not only saved themselves but the countiy from
utter ruin and destruction I confidently believe
that the withdrawal of the confidente of the Gov
ernment, so stiengthened the operation of all ihe
causes to which I have advened, that it compelled
the banks toa couise which, with the fostering care
and continued confidence of ihe Government, could
and would have been avoided for the banks have
no interest, whatever, to embarrass their own opera-
tions by an act so destructive of that credit which is
so necessary to the succe sful extension of then
business—for sound unsuspected credit is the verj
soul of their operations, and the foundation of their
profits
The truth of this argument is fully sustained by
recurrence to the history of the Bank of England
as well as 0111 own banking institutions     On many
occasions the   Bank of Ergland has been sorelv
pressed vet it relamed the confidence, and v os ended
by t!f Government, and was enabled thereby to sur
mount its embarrassment and recover fiom 1 s dn
Acuities    In 1793, particularly, its operations w ere
so embarrassed, and the rush for specie so grpat, that
it was compelled to suspend specie payments, and
continued   the   suspension, without   intermission,
from that time till 1829, many of the causes, which
produced the suspension, continuing to exist during
whole time    In this state of embarrassment, its
course was justified by the British Government,
whose confidence, and that of the mercantile com
muni y continued, and its sa-pension w as legalized,
uatil finally, ly a pruden'ial course of measui es,
adopted to its true condition, it triumphed ov er all
difficulties, and, in 1829, resumed specie payments,
which it still continues The confidence of the Gov
emmen1 and merchants eiw oled the banl thus to sus-
tain itself, to maintain its solvency and its credit;
and to perform, with success, its commercial and
fiscal duties
In 1815, the State banks from the operation of
many causes, suspended specie payments, yet the
confidence oí the Government w as not withdrawn
Mr  Dallas and Mr Caw ford, both able and patn
otic men, as  Se letanes of the Treasury, having
sustained their ciedit by all the means in the^r
power    Mr   Crawfoid, particularly, made large
dtpósites of public money m many of them, and
thereby enable 1 them to indulge the people, main
tain then own credit, redeem their debt to the pub
he, and finally, in 1817, to resume specie payment
/ belieie if the same benciolent and patnolic policy
had bernpu7Siu.il to a aids the State ban/a, at the pies
cntp"iiod, the evicting snspens on would not have con
tmued to this time if it had talen place at all     Ml
Dallas nor Mr   Ciawford  howevei,had no' con
ceived the idea of a total $ipa> alwn between the Gov
emment and the banlmg institutions of the country
as fiscal agents, and, therefore, lelt some induce
ment to sustain and preserve them, but a different
feeling seems to prevail with the present becietaiy
of the Treasury, who can only expect to succeed in
his views by the embairassments and d'fficulties
of the banks    While 1 do not ascribe to him any
design to produce the cmbairassmcnt  which his
overtaken the Lanks, and, w ith them, the commerce
of the counti\, jet I am well salislied that he has
withheld from them that confidence, which might
justly have been extended, and w hich would btloic
this, have redeemed them from then embaritssmg
difficulties, and have afforded salutaiy relief to the
people, and the commerce of the country
Ihe charge made bv the President, and those
who now favor a total separation be'ween the fiscal
operations of the Government and the banl s, 'that
they have been guilty of an excessive issue and en
dilation of their paper," is true—lame itablv true
Yet I cannot peicpivc m all the facts and circum-
stances connected with the charge that thej have
been actuated by any improper 01 impure motives
These institutions are conducted by men who aie
liable tobe misled by the same impulses which be
tray the most prudent and the most cautious of man
kind into occasional error A spirit of speculation
had extensively spread itself throughout the co 111-
trv ac ed and íe acted from the people to the banks,
and fiom the ^anks to the people until ad absoibed
by brilliant piospects of immeasurable wealth wpie
beyond the bounds of prudence and discretion, and
imn, to many, has been the penalty These impiil
ses have occasionally produced like effects through
all periods, and íesulted m like catastrophes,
whether their cuirency was exclusively metallic 01
not
All these evils caiij with them howevel suic
an'idotcs The current of money has its level, and
whenever it exceeds ihnt level the redundancy
runs off, and haves the current at its proper level
In its mine ion serious and distressing injury is
often inflicted, jet the retuin is grauual and sure
But a question arises whether the banks aie ( ntne-
ly m fault in this mattei 1 Is not the Government
itsell much m fault 1 And shall the banks be com
pelled to take the w hole responsibility for anerior
in which the Government has lugelv participated '
At the time the public deposites weie removed

To THE PnFSIDEM OP THE GlKARD BANK, PHILADELPHIA
This recommendation was icpeated by the late
President in his succeeding annual message By
the deposite act of June, 183b, for pioportions of the
public money beyond a specific amount, the deposite
banks weie lequned to pay inleiat, which made it a
pi maple of self-defence, that thej should extend their
loans and mci ease then cu dilation, because it was
not to be expected that they would lock up, andtep
unemployed, the public money, ov winch they were
bound to pay inleiest' These two causes combined
certainly produced an excess in the bank discounts
and cnculation of the country This excess has
been increased by another cause, which Mr Taney
nor Congress did not, or could not, have anticipated
The vacuum which was anticipated by the refusal
to 1 enew the charter of the Bankof the United States,
was never produced, for contiary to all expectation,
the capital and stockholtlers ol that bank were sub-
sequently mcorpoiated bj the State of Pennsylva-
nia whith continued 111 circulation its notes, and
pievented any mateiial diminution 111 us discounts.
I appeal, then, to the j,ood sense of this huu«,e to
say, -whether tne excessive issues complained of,
have not been pioduced bj causes, cah ulated in their
very nature to mislead, and produce the excess
complained of, without the slightest imputation of
fraud or cot ntption against the banks1
Mi Chan man, ti e connexion which now exists
between the finances of the Government and the
deposite banks, was ptociuced by the solicitations of
the Government itself The Government found
itself engaged 111 a sev ere and dubious conflict with
the B ink ol the United btates, whic<l it had deter-
mined to oveiilnow To do this; it was necessary
so to conduct its operations, that ihe commerce and
busmessoi the country minditnc the materially shock-
ed, and the sensibilities of the people exiited To
t licet tins, it sought the aid, and procured the opera-
tion, of the late deposite bantvs, without whose aid
and co opeiation, I have no hesitation m believing,
