leaving in their hands 2 caissons. A more detailed report will be made hereafter. I have sent staff officers forward to send to me as far as Dunkirk subsistence and forage. It is very essential that it should reach me at that point.

I will march down the north bank of the Mattapony in the expectation that I may be able to obtain some supplies through the country in that vicinity. None can be obtained south of the Mattapony, between this point and the White House.

The following troops were sent from Lee's army and Richmond to re-enforce Jones' command in the valley: Breckinridge's corps, 4,000; 2,000 dismounted cavalry to Gordonsville; the rebel cavalry under Hampton and Fitz. Lee, and Pickett's old division, or a part of it. Pickett's troops went either by the canal to Columbia, or by railroad via Lynchburg to Charlottesville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I found on my arrival here yesterday two divisions of the enemy's cavalry in front of this place. This morning I crossed the bridge. The enemy fell back behind Black Creek at a point near Tunstall's Station. This place is all right. The enemy shelled the trains yesterday before I arrived. They were yesterday evening all crossed over to the north side of the Pamunkey.

WHITE HOUSE, June 22, 1864-4 p. m.

I moved against the enemy's forces at this place yesterday; they all fell back over Black Creek, taking a strong position near Tunstall's Station. During the night the enemy retreated, and crossed Bottom's Bridge. I sent General Torbet's division to Jones' Bridge this morning. have not yet learned whether or no General Torbet has secured the crossing at that place. I shall star the trains to-night for Jones' Bridge, and hope to get everything off by to-morrow morning. I have in the trains here 800 wagons.
