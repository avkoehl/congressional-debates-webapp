OFFICE ACTG. ASST. PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL FOR STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA,

Harrisburg, Pa., July 29, 1863.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to ask, now that the draft is so well advanced i Philadelphia, if it would not be advisable to commence putting troops in position at Pottsville or vicinity for operations in the mining districts. There is some pressure there now, I believe, and the presence of 500 men would perhaps answer present necessities. A force of about 2,000 men will be required there, and if the affairs at Scranton and in the southern parts of Luzerne and Columbia Counties, and indeed of the whole of the coal regions, be considered in one plan of operations, a larger force will be necessary to guard strongly the communications by bridges, railroads, &amp;c. I presume that when the full force shall be sent to Pottsville that additional troops will have to be sent to the other points spoken of. I expect to hear from General Couch, commanding Department of the Susquehanna, as soon as the policy is settled as to the time to commence to enforce the enrollment in those localities, and which is now respectfully referee to you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. V. BOMFORD,

Lieutenant Colonel 16th U. S. Infty., A. A. P. M. G. for Pennsylvania.
