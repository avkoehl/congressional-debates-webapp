the peace in the exercise of their functions, so far as regards the preservation of order, they making the oath of allegiance. Clerks of courts of record also continue their functions on the same condition. In the city of Richmond I have been obliged to organize a court of arbitration for civil matters of pressing importance. The arrangements gives general satisfaction. The judges selected have not been politicians, and are universally respected. I inclose a copy of General Orders, No. 5, in regard to this court.*

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE JAMES,Richmond, Va., May 11, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

SIR: When I arrived here I found that very little care had been taken to secure and preserve the documents and archives of the rebel government. Many which has escaped the conflagration had been plundered and carried off by relic hunters. Neither General Weitzel nor General Ord seemed to have considered the importance of preservating all official and private papers of the rebel leaders for future reference and as evidence against them and their coadjutors, here and at the North. It is very possible, however, that the papers which I have been able to preserve may furnish important links of testimony against prominent traitors. To avoid the risk of attempting to assort and classify them here I have directed Colonel Cutts to send them to Assistant Secretary Dana, as fast they could be boxed, with a general description of the contents of each box. Over ninety large boxes have already been shipped. I commenced this matter to your attention. Although many of the papers forwarded will probably prove worthless, yet there may be found among them much evidence in regard to plots of assassination, incendiarism, treason, &amp;c. They therefore should be most carefully examined and preserved. At any rate, they will prove of great value to those who may hereafter write the history of this great rebellion. I have given strangest orders that all persons having such public papers in their possession must give them up, and all officers and soldiers who appropriate them to their own use, or give them away, will be severely punished. Most of the offices connected with the rebel War and Navy Departments were burned. Some of the plundered papers, however, have been recovered. General Wright may have been able to recover others between here and Greensborough. I gave him orders to that effect. Benjamin removed the most important papers from the State Department, but many of them have been recovered, and I hope we may yet find more. Colonel Cutts, of my staff, who has been charged with this matter, has applied himself to the task with great industry, energy, and tact. He deserves much credit for collecting and saving so large a mass of public papers and documents, which in a few days more would have been destroyed or hopelessly scattered.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
