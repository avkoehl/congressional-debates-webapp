succession of Captain Wilds to its command late in the action. There were, however, many instances of devotion in its ranks, and the bearing and service of Lieutenant Chappell conspicuously attracted the attention of the brigade commander.

Private Vincent Bellinger, a cripple from wounds received at Secessionville, and on light duty with the commissary, quit the train when he hard the action was going against us and came upon the field. Picking up the rifle of a fallen man he joined a company and fought well during the remainder of the day.

Respectfully,

JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Brigadier-General.

Captain FOOTE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. HAGOOD'S Brigadier, SOUTH CAROLINA VOLS.,May 22, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I am directed to submit a report of the part taken by my brigade in the battle of Drewry's Bluff of the 16th instant:

My command occupied the left of our second or intermediate line, embracing Fort Stevens, and with its right on the turnpike. The enemy occupied our exterior line of breast-works, which had been previously abandoned, supported by a battery of five pieces, where the turnpike crosses these works, with skirmishers well thrown out toward us. They had also constructed a second line of works in rear of this at some 200 yards distance, and had entangled the abatis between the two lines with wire.

Shortly after General Ransom's division had engaged the enemy on my left, and while his advance was still parallel to my line, I was ordered to advance and drive the enemy from our outer line of works. This was happily accomplished, under cover of the early daylight,
