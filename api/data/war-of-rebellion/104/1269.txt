I send you some papers and a letter. Do not fail to let me know of any movement on the Bigbee, and let your scouts look out for deserters going down the river.

Very respectfully,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

ABBEVILLE, S. C., April 29, 1865-7.30 a. m.

Mr. PRESIDENT: We had intended starting yesterday afternoon, but were detained by the rain. Are just about getting off now. The ladies and children are very well, and in good spirits. They move in a good ambulance and carriage, and will reach Washington in a two days' drive from this place. From Washington we shall go toward Atlanta; there to halt, until we seen or hear from you. This movement was determined by your telegrams, and by the belief that you would move westward, along a line running north of this place. Colonel Leovy has been kind enough to set out from here to meet you, to explain our plans, &amp;c. He will tell you everything.

With sincere prayers and hopes for your health and safety, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BURTON N. HARRISON.

DEMOPOLIS, April 29, 1865.

Captain W. T. SMITH,

Suggsville, Ala.:

CAPTAIN: I received last evening your dispatch of the 27th at 6 a. m. I worth you by courier yesterday, and since then have but little to add. General Hood is here, on his way to Meridian. He informs me that General Lee is captured. He believes the armistice will be respected in this department in courtesy to Generals Johnston and Sherman. But I have so little faith in their professions that I want the scouts to be constantly on the lookout for every movement of the enemy. I have just started six men under Captain Jones to scout from Uniontown down toward Cahawba. Major Ewing has returned some of your men and will send the others as fast as they can be relieved. General Taylor left Meridian last night to go toward Mobile, relative to the armistice, but we are all in the dark yet as to what is to be done.

Very respectfully,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPLIS, April 29, 1865.

Lieutenant General N. B. FORREST,

Gainesville, Ala.:

I am directed by General hood to inform you that he will leave here this morning for Meridian, and he invites you and Governor Harris to meet him there to-morrow.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
