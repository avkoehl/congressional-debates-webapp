sented by the State of Connecticut tor reim-
bursement, under the act of July 27, 1801, of
amounts paid to second assistant and other
surgeons, for services rendered in connectiun
with raising and organizing volunteers wuhin
the State during the rebellion, are not admissi-
ble under the law, for the reason that the em-
ployment ot' those officers was not authorized
prior to the act of July 2, 1802; and that it
appears that the officers actually rendered the
services, and were paid in good faiih by the
State, and were subsequently mustered as
employed in the service of the United States.

counts presented under the act of July 27,

advanced by the State in payment of extra
surgeons or assistant surgeons for services ren-
dered prior to their muster into the service of
the United States; the claims to be settled
upon proper vouchers to be tiled and passed
upon by the proper accounting olficeis of the
1 reasury. Where the vouchers ot otherStateS
for payments made to extra surgeons or assist-
ant surgeons of militia or volunteers accepted
into the service of the United States are situ-
ated similarly with those of Connecticut, the
Treasury Department is to adjust and settle
them according to the provisions of the fore-
going seciion.
