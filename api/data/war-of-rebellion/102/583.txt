HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 24, 1865. (Received 6 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The following dispatch from General Dodge just received. We have not at present troops enough to furnish escorts to all these parties, but hope soon to clear the region of Indians. We will certainly do so as soon as I can get the brigade of cavalry now here mounted:

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 24, 1865.

Major-General POPE:

I find on arrival here some five surveying parties under general contract, two Indian agents, one wagon-road company, and others, all asking for escorts. The country they operate in is entirely unsafe, and it will take at least two regiments, part infantry and part cavalry, to supply the demand. This is getting to be a serious question and I would like your advice. If I give escorts I will have to bring the troops here to do it. The parties seem to have proper claims on the Government. The freight contractors to Utah and New Mexico have to be guarded, and the number of trains leaving on Government account will use up a small army. The Indian agents have good, but Colonel Livingston got after their Indians and used them us. I think all the band that was engaged in robberies this side of Kearny were killed.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
