LAND MAPS.
Mr. HOLMAN, from the same committee,
reported the following resolution :
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House pay to John
Wilson, out of the contingent fund of the House, in
fall satisfaction for his services in superintending
and preparing the maps of the public land Sta' es
ordered by resolution of the House of May 4.1818.
, the sum ot 43,600, the said John Wilson bavins been
| employed in said duty from 4th of May, 1848, to 1-lth
of January, 1S52.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask for the reading of
the report which accompanies the resolution.
Mr. WOOD. I make the point of order
that the resolution makes an appropriation and
must have its first consideration in Committee
of the Whole.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point of order. This is a House resolution
directing a payment out of the contingent fund.
It is not an appropriation bill.
Mr. WTOOD* Is it not an appropriation of
this amount?
The SPEAKER. It merely proposes to pay
money already appropriated.
The report was read. It states that the Com-
mittee of Claims had referred totliem the claim
of John Wilson, jr., for superintending, aiding,
and directing tie preparation of maps of the
public land States, ordered by the following
resolution of the House of Representatives of
May 4, 1848:
" Resolved, That there beprepared by procurement
of the Clerk for the use of the House and the Commit-
tee thereof on the Public Lands a map of the public
lands in each State, showing the state of the surveys,
and also what has been sold; and that the same be
prepared under the supervision of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office; and that the said, maps
be revised and extended after each session of Con-
Tlie committee report that they have care-
fully considered the claim of Mi'. :Wilson, and
find that under the authority conferred by the
foregoing resolution the Olerk of the House
of Representatives employed "the claimant,
then a principal clerk in the General Land
Office at Washington, to superintend the execu-
tion of the land maps for the Committee on the
Public Lands of the House of Representatives;
that he performed that service faithfully and
satisfactorily from May 4,1848, to January 14,
1852, while he discharged with acceptability
his duties as clerk in the Land Office, for which
he was regularly paid his salary at the rate of
$1,800 per annum.
The report further states that the claimant _
seems to have been employed on this duty '
because, from his experience in the Land Office,
he was the most competent person to superin-
tend the work and to instruct others in the busi-
ness, and to insure accuracy in the records and
maps of the Land Committee, and not as a favor
merely to the claimant; that after three years
and eight months he was voluntarily relieved
from the duty, and the person on whom it was
then devolved was paid at the rate of $1,800
per annum, which was afterward increased to
a larger sum, while the most important and
laborious part of the work had been executed
by the claimant.
The report further states that for the services
thus rendered the claimant has received no
compensation, the accounting officers of the
Government properly holding that under sec-
tion two of an act approved August 23, 1842,
and section twenty-five of an act approved
August 2G, 1842, no person in any branch of
the public service whose pay is fixed by law
or regulations can receive any additional pay
in any form whatever for any other service or
duty whatever, unless the same and the appro-
priation therefor be explicitly set forth that it
is for such additional pay or extra allowance;
that while this service was provided for, there
was no explicit appropriation of money in favor
of the claimant.
The committee agree, however, that the
claimant ought to be paid for the service, and
recommend the passage of the accompanying
resolution for that purpose.
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask to have read a letter
from a late Commissioner of the General Land
Office.
Mr. DAWES. It does seem to me that the
I gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Holmak] has
j lost sight of the particular use for which the
; contingent fund of this House is appropriated,
if he proposes to pay out of it a claim that is
eighteen or twenty years old. This claim, if
worthy of payment at all, should be paid out of
the Treasury of the United States, and not paid
out of the contingent fund of this House.
Mr. HOLMAN. I see the point which the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes]
makes, but I ask that this letter be read, and
then I will state to the House the ground upon
which this resolution is based.
The Clerk read as follows:
Washington City, April 5,1860.
To the honorable the Committee of Claims of the Ifouse
of Representatives, United States : .
I certify that while John Wilson was engaged ui
superintending and directing tlie preparation ot tn.e
II maps of the land States, ordered by resolution of too
:i House of Representatives of the 4th ot Mas, 184S.
|i liยซ devoted to that service, according to the best ot
;i my recollection, full as much if not more time th, 
! that ordinarily given to office busmess. In my pre-
vious statement on this subject I said tl!iaโข
I] nf this service he was compelled to attend to
|i ins own official duties chiefly after oflice hours; and
i I know Ml well that those duties were exceedingly
II onerous, requiring at least six hours per day to dis-
