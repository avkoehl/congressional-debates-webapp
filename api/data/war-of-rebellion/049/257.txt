If you approve, I will send Averell from Beverly, and a portion of Scammon's force from the Kanawha, and drive the rebels from Greenbrier, Pocahontas, and Monroe, with orders, if the information obtained at Lewisburg will warrant such a movement, to push on to Dublin Station or Christiansburg, on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and destroy the bridges in that neighborhood.

I returned this morning from Harper's Ferry. All quiet along line of railroad.
