ROCKFISH CREEK, February 25, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg:

Sherman is reported to have turned east at Winnsborough, and crossed the Wateree River. This indicates Fayetteville and Raleigh by the old mail-stage road, and through a country not drained of supplies. Hardee is supposed to be in his front at Cheraw. By a union of my forces with General Beauregard at Fayetteville we might strike him before he forms a junction with Schofield or gets supplies up the Cape Fear. If we lose this opportunity we shall be again divided.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charlotte, N. C.:

If Sherman moves as you suppose we should all concentrate in his front at Fayetteville. Hardee by Cheraw, retarding his advance; you by way of Raleigh, and my forces from here and Goldsborough. General Lee might aid us, and a success by the result. Divided we can do nothing. A junction with Schofield, who has 20,000, will make Sherman very strong, but embarrass his commissariat, if we can only control the river.

ROCKFISH CREEK, February 25, 1865.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charlotte, N. C.:

A detachment is moving to the Cape Fear to obstruct river and retard the enemy. His force is too large for me to meet him with success. He has two corps under Schofield. We have but a division. Please keep Lieutenant-Colonel Childs at Fayetteville advised by telegraph of Sherman's movements, should they tend that way.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Raleigh:

The main command is at this point; the cavalry at Northeast River. The Federal commander has agreed to receive the prisoners there. See local authorities and urge their rapid transfer to that point. The governor should urge forward the organization of his State forces.

Lieutenant-Colonel OLADOWSKI,

Goldsborough:

Establish depot at Raleigh, and keep only current supplies at Goldsborough.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
