LEWISBURG, January 28, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel R. F. PATTERSON,

Provost-Marshal-General, Little Rock:

I left Dardanelle Thursday morning last. At that time what was left of Newton's regiment was going for Coddo Gap as fast as horseflesh could carry the. After his stampede at Boggs' Mill I do not think he had 150 men left. He has had no artillery with him. Brooks had one piece. Send for Major Jenks, First Iowa Cavalry, who arrived in Little Rock last evening. He can post you fully as to affairs above.

Respectfully,

A. H. RAYN,

Colonel.

Major General N. J. T. DANA,

Commanding, &amp;c., Memphis, Tenn.:

Prepare 2,500 infantry from the District of Memphis for service in the field and send them with as little delay as practicable to report at this place. Direct General Washburn to detach in like manner 2,000 infantry from the District of Vicksburg. Both detachments will bring with them not only the field transportation required by existing orders, but also a supply train for a march of twenty days. Fuller instructions will be sent to-morrow.
