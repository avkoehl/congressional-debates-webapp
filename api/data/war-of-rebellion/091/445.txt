WHITE PLAINS, October 22, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have had the honor to receive dispatch. The cavalry here and at Piedmont number about 500. The remainder are on the railroad to rear of this, and cannot be spared from the road. I send what is here and at Piedmont at once to the country south of Chester Gap. If any of Longstreet's men have crossed the mountains they will find them.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received a dispatch from General Sheridan. Nothing new. The escort is waiting at Piedmont. If there are any messages for the general now is a good time to forward them.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 22, 1864-3.20 p. m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

I have nothing for General Sheridan except my warmest congratulations. Tell him Sherman is in hot pursuit of Hood. I wish he would decide as early as possible about completing the Manassas road.

Lieutenant Colonel C. KINGSBURY, Jr.,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters Middle Military Division:

COLONEL: I have the honor to request that, if not incompatible with the interests of the service, the Third Brigade, First Division, Colonel O. Edwards commanding, now at Winchester, be returned to duty with the corps. The division to which the brigade belongs number without it only 1,550 enlisted men for duty, with only one field officer. The brigade is an excellent one, and might, it is suggested, be replaced by troops who, having seen less service, would not be so valuable in the field, while they could perform the duty at Winchester as well.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
