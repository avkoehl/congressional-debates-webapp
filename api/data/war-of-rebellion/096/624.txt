MARTINSBURG, February 21, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Major-Generals Crook and Kelley and a number of officers have been captured about two hours ago a body of 100 rebel cavalry. They seem to have gone by way of Romney. I will telegraph again in a few moments.

The above dispatch, from Cumberland, I have sent to General Sheridan, at Winchester, by road.

WASHINGTON, February 21, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

The following just received:

A party of 60 or 100 rebels, picked Rosser's command, darted in upon our pickets this a. m. at 3 o'clock, capturing them. They came into the town and carried away Generals Crook and Kelley, and one or two other officers. They broke into one or two stores, but did not remain to take anything. They were evidently men from this place, and men acquainted with localities. Parties are after them.
