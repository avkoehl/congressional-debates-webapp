Brigadier-General RUGER,

Very respectfully,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Lynnville, Tenn., November 24, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Commanding Third Div., Twenty-third Army Corps, Hurricane:

GENERAL: I have just heard from General Ruger that Colonel Capron has been fighting the enemy all day and has been driven back to Mount Pleasant. All information indicates that Hood is nearer Columbia to-night than I am. I have therefore ordered Stanley to march at once. I desire you to move at once to or near Columbia and hold the enemy in check, as far as practicable, long enough for Stanley to get in. The protection of the railroad is now a matter of no consequence; the question is to concentrate the entire force at Columbia in time. I have directed General Ruger, who is at Columbia, to communicate with you. His force there is very small. I will join you with the head of Stanley's column.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

P. S.-Inform me by courier frequently of the state of affairs.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LYNNVILLE, November 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX:

March to or near Columbia at once, and hold the enemy in check until Stanley comes in. Colonel Capron has been fighting all day and has been driven back to Mount Pleasant. Hold the enemy out as far as you can. Stanley will march soon.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
