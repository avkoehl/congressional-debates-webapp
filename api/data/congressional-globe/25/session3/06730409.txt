of the United States, [Mr Grundy,] as severally
quoted by the Senator from  Kentucky, [Mr
Crittenden,] in his able speech in support of
his bill, give the answer     In the celebiated re-
port on Executive patronage, the Senator fiom
Missoun told us that officers deuving their ap-
pointments from the Piesident would be animated
with his spirit and moved by his will—tha* " a
power ovei a man's support was a power ovei
his will "   The Attorney Generat of the United
States, in a speech made by him during his sei-
vice in Congress, declared that when he saw an
office-lioldei going to the polls, he could not le-
gist the conviction that he was " thinking of his
salai y and his bread," and the honoiable Sena
toi fiom Pennsylvania, in a speech made bv him
some years ago, ui the othci House, had told us
that these " office holders aie but the enlisted sol-
diers of the Administration'"    Now, Mi   Pies-
ident, it does seem to me that persons standingm
such dependantielationson the Executive aie not
the most proper counselois of a free people in
the exeieise of their electoral rights
I know, sir, there are honoiab'e exceptions to
this general descuption of office holders, that
theie are men in office who, however desnable
their places may be to them, would never consent
to put chase a continuance in office by the sacri
fice of their consciences, or by unworthy com-
pliances of any sort But s'ill it will be true, in
general, fiom the very nature of things, that those
who fill public offices will be animated by the same
spa it, and governed by the same views, with the
power which confers and can take away those
offices More especially must this be the case
when that licentious motto of party pillage, " to
the victors belong the spoils," utteied in "evil
hour" on thisflooi oy a Senatoi fiom New Yoik,

the country, shall, as everything indicates it will,

of Departments, indeed, if I mistake not, (the
Postmaster Geneial,) has, in substance, openly
pioclaimed. in a letter published not long since,
thathe should considei himself guilty of tieachery
to bis paity if he appointed to office any one who
was not a supportei of the Admimstiation I
pretend not to quote the words, but this, accoid-
ing to the best of my recollection, was the sub
stance and spit it of the declaiation
Office holders, then, in general, from the natuie
of things, and fiom the tendency of the times,
musí be expected to be animated with the spiut,
and devoted to the policy and views of the chief
Executive Magistrate, from whom, dnectly 01
indiiectly, they denve their appointments, and
on whom they depend foi continuance in office
Suiely, no candid and reflecting man will dehb-
eiately say that persons standing in this situ ition
ought to be licensed, much less prompted and en-
couraged, to take an active part in controlling
those popularelcctionsjthiough which it was the
design oí oui republican system that the conduct
of themsehes and of their supenor3 should be
brought to the test of a free, sovereign, and un-
biased pubhejudgment.
The honoiable Senator fiom New Jersey, how-
ever, seems to think it a very gieat hardship, a
violation of the equality of our laws, and of the
spirit of the Constitution, that peisons holding
public offices should be temporauly abudsed of
pi lvileges enjoyed and txei cised by other citizens.
But is tl is any novelty in oui polity or legisla-
tion' Does not the Constitution itself especia'ly
provide that " no peison holding any office under
the United States shall be a member of either
House of Congies-i during his continuance in
office, and also that "no person holding an office
of trust or profit under the United States shall be

appointed an elector of President and Vice Pres-
ident'"   These are privileges, and very high
privileges, too, (especially the fiist,) enjoyed by
all other citizens, and yet the express fiat of the
Constitution excludes all persons holding office
from the enjoyment of them while they shall
continue in office    Are office holders better fitted,
oi  have they, in the eye of reason and sound
policy, any better light to erect themselves into
political guaidians and prompters of the people
in elections, than to be their lepresentatives and
servants in the Legislature, fiom which we have
just seen they are expiessly excluded by the very
lettei of the Constitution'  The honoiable Sena-
tor also said in his repoit,that "under the exist-
ing laws, a citizen of a State does not, by accept-
ing any of the offices under the Federal Govern-
ment, forfeit any of the rights and  privileges
which belong to him as a citizen of a State   Now,
sir, so far as the legislation of the Commonwealth
which I have the honor to represent in part on
this floor is concerned, the gentleman is wholly
mistaken     By accepting an office under the Fed
etal Government, a citizen of Virginia does foi-
feit, during his continuance in such office, the
pi ívilege enjoyed by all othei citizens oTthe State,
of eligibility to any office under the authority of
the Commonwealth     Cyan act of fundament il   I

We see, then, that all oui  institutions, State I
and Fcdi ral, ci eate a broad line of d ¡sanction be-
tween nffice-holdeis and the gineial mass of citi
zens   They impose political disqualifications and
restnctions upon the fotmei, dunng their contin-
uance in office, from which thegieat body of the
community aie exempt   And wisely do they do it
These exclusions have then  ongin m thatsalu
tary jealousy of powei winch is the very instinct
and vital pi inciple of liberty   WhatdoesMr Jef-
ferson tell us, in that very passage which the lion
oiable Senator has quoted   in  ins repot t, appa
rently unconscious of its foice and just application
to oveithiowall the wiie diawn niguments of his
elaboiite defense of the equal lights of office hold
ers'    Does he not tell us that " fice government
ltbelf is founded in jealousy'    It is jealousy, not
confidence, winch juescribes limited constitutions
to bind down those whom we aie obliged to trust
with power "
One of the most conspicuous fiutts of this wise
jealousy, wheiever floe government is known, is
to icstiAin all poisons invested with public office
fioul any intei ference with the fiec exeicise of
the soveieign light of election by the people The
Senatoi fiom Kentucky has shown us what weie
the solemn declaiations of Mi Jefferson on this
subject before his accession to the Piesidency,
and the memoiable circulai which he caused to be
issued in puisuance of those declarations after he
enteied upon his high duties He his also prop
oily ltmmded us of the emphatic adoption of the
seme principle by President Jackson, when, in
his first mauguial address, he announced to the
countiy, as ibe leading bianch of his " task of
refoim," " the conection of those abuses that
have biought the patronage of the Federal Gov-
ernment into conflict with the fieedom of elec-
tions " We have seen, also, what has been the
legislation of that country (next to our own the
fieest under the sun, and from which our anees
tors brought with them so many of our own cliei
ished institutions) for the purpose of lepressmg
official interfeienco with the fieedom of elections
But the Senatoi fiom New Jersey seeks to
weaken the just influence of these weighty opin
ions and grave precedents by asenbing them to
some paltry consideianon of temporal y expedí J
ency, rather than to the controlling authority of
gieat and enduung pnneiples Mi Jefferson's
declarations, as well as that of Genei al Jackson, he
seemed to intimate, weie intended more as a íe
flection on the conduct of their predecessors than
Senate.
as the annunciation of a great principle of civil
Government
Mr. WALL explained
Mr RIVES. Let us look at the declarations of
Mr Jefferson themselves, and then we shall un-
derstand their true chai actef and import. He had
received, while the piesidential election was yet
pendens, a letter fiom Governor McKean, of
Pennsylvania, informing him of the misconduct
of certain Federal officeis in that State In his
íeply, dated February 2, 1801, he uses this em-
phatic language
" One thing I will say, that, as to the future,interferences
with elections, whether of the State or General Govern-
ment, by oiheers ot the latter, should be deemed cause of
removal, because the constitutional remedy by the elec-
tive priiieipk becomes notlnngifitmiy be smothered bytbe
enormous patronage ol the General Government "
The circular which he caused to be issued by
the several heads of Depaitments, immediately
after lus induction into office, is in the following
words

Now, Mi Pie«ident, do you discern, or can
any member of this body discern, in these sol-
emn and emphatic declaiations, the slightest ap-
pearance of an act of mere tcmporuvexpediency
or of patty reciimination ' On the contrary, do
they not proclaim thcnon-inteifeience of Federal
executive officeis with popular elections to be a
fundamental pimciple of liberty and the Consti-
tution, as" essential to the mutual independence"
of the Slate and Geneial Governments, so " vi
tally chenshed" by Amencan institutions, and
as indispensable, indeed, to presei ve from destiuo-
tion the gieat "constitutional icmcdy"of the
elective nght itself Could the principle be
pi iced on higher or more sacred oi more endui-
tng giountl' It is impossible, indeed, to lead
these noble monuments of the principles of Mi

devotion to, and just appreciation of, popula^

issertetl the light of election to be " a light ines-
timable to freemen and foi mid ible to tyianta

ineulctted " a jealous caie of the i ¿lit of election
by the people, as the mild and safe coirective of
abuses winch aie lopped by the swoid of elec-
tion, whoie peaceable remedies are unprovided "
These, sir, die the principles of a puie, unadut-
temted, conseivative Democracy, and I would beg
leave to commend thorn to the meditation of the
honoiable Senator fiom New Jersey, before he
comes fotward with anothci defense of the piag-
matic lights of office-holders
In regard to the legislation of England on the
subject, the honorable Senator, confining Ins view
to a singlo statute, (that of the fifth year of Wil-
liam III ,) treated it as a special bargain between
the King and the Commons, to pioeure supplies
for the Crown, on the one hand, and to protect
certain corporate rights of election held by the
Commons, or their constituents, on the othei,
or, in Othei words, as a sort of mercantile coil-
tiact, by which the King agteed, if the Com-
mons would giant hi n a stipulated sum in taxes,
he would rcfiatn fiom interfeung,by his ofliei is,
with the election of the Commons But,sir,tlns
is most grossly to misconceive the dignity and
chaiactei of the question, and todegiado it below
the noble principles on which it íests The fiee-
dom of elections ft im official inter ference, as it
pi inciple of English hboi ty, is rooted in the glon
ous revolution of 1688, being intimately connected
both with the moving causes and the immediate
i íesults of that gieat event    It the Senator ñon
