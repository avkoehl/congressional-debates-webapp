Resurrection Notes—Mr. Grundy.
4 f a \mt
Senate,
the condition of the moneyed relations between
England and the United States, is wholly changed.
The pressure and necessity which existed at the
time of the suspension of specie payments has
entirely (eased, and it may well be doubted
whether the publ c will be satisfied with a continu-
ance of a policy, apparently dictated by necessity,
when that necessity no longer exists
In the second paragraph of this letter, a false
issue is attempted to be made up The language
of the letter is as follows
"The credit system of the United States, and the
exclusively metallic system, are now fairly in the
field, face to face, one or the other must fall There
can be no other issue It is not a question of cor-
recting errors or reforming abuses, but of abso-
lute destruction not who shall conquer, but who
shall survive.  The present struggle must be finil "
Now, I would inquire, by what authority the
writer of this letter made up this issue' Has, the
President, or any of his friends, avowed a deter-
mmalion or wish to destroy the creditsystem? This
credit system, I presume, ¡« but another term lor
the banking system So far as my opinion goes, I
disclaim every sentiment of (he kind Banking, in
my judgment, ii necessary to promote the growth
and prospentyof the countiy But whai kind of
banking, and how far shall it be carried? That is
the true question, and the point upon which a dif-
ference ot opinion exists Safe, honest banking,
which shall not only promise, but shall actually pay
and redeemits liabilities, when required, according
to its engagements, I am favorable to But that kind
of banking which promises liberally, but fails in the
performance, I always, have been, and am still, op
posed to A bank which shall issue two or three
for one upon its cpital pud m, miy be, piobably
is, safe and entitled to public confidence, but that
which shall issue twenty thirty, or foity for one, is
unsafe, and will end m dishonest bankruptcy It
is the excess, net tht thing itself, towards which I
feel any hostility Recently we have seen instances
of the explosion of banks of the latter description,
which should teach us all the danger there is in such
institutions.
What evidence is th-re that the party of which
I am a member, is opp >sed to Stite banks, and
wishes their destruction' 1'his seems to be taken
for granted, from the fact that the Opposition are
the owners and directors oí almost all the banks in
the country That they own them and control
them, is general1) tru , piobibly to the extent of
ten lo one But it dots not follow from this, that
their destruction i« sought for or desired That the}
should be honest, and obey (he laws of the countrv,
and comply with their engagements, is anxiously
wished for—nothing more
As to what course tne Government should pur-
sue towards banks wi.ich miy resume specie pay
ments at some short penod, I can only express my
own opinion, which is, t-at whatever aid and as-
sistance the laws that may be in force shill pci-
mn, shoul J, ii necessary, be given to them, in other
words, all the discretion which may be allowed to
the Fxec itive b inch ot the Government, sho lid
be exercised m their fivor At the s,me time, 1
should be unwilling to see any negotiation com-
menced or carried on with them, foi the purpose of
inducing them to resume specie payments They
should first show tint ih y were honest and safe
depositones before an\ kind of convention snould
exist between them ana the Government Then,
to guard them against any unforeseen contingency
w hich might arise frjm thp des gns or assaults of
other institutions, eury inciden al aid which the
Government cm furni h si ull be extended to
them Tne Lost lit} oí tne present Cnief Mag a-
t tie to all banl-s has been cna-ge 1 apon tins floor,
and what wps tne en y e< idence re led on to esta-
blish iC It w as that the Fiesident an 1 Secretar} of
the Treasury 1 ad suggested, at *he special seasi m
in September last, the propriety of a bankrupt liw
in relation to banks refusing to discharge the r
liabilities when demanded, according to their en-
gagements Th s has betn spoken of and treated
as a new and alarming measure, never before
thought of or attemp'ed Have gentlemen forgot-
ten that Mr. Dallas, Secretary of ihe Treasury un-
áer Mí. Madison, «either of whom was ever sus-
pected or charged w;th hostility to State banks,
made a similar recommendation, and, in addition,
advised that a double stamp duty should be im-
posed on every note issued by a non-specie-paying
bank? Have they forgotten that Mr Crawford,
also, Secretary of the Ireasury under Mr. Monroe,
recommended the same measure'' The cemtnum-
catton of Mr Dallas, contaimug this recommenda-
tion, was made to the House of Representatives on
the 19th of March, 1816 That of Mr Crawford
was made on the SOth of February, 1820 These
recommendations excited no alarm no denun-
ciation of the hostility of their authors to State
banks was ever made So fai from it, when the
enemies of Mr Craw ford were exhibiting charges
against him for the purpose of destroying his popu-
larity and standing, the charge exhibited was, that
he was too favorable to the State banks. And was
the occasion or the manner in which the subject has
been adverted to by the present Chief Magistrate,
such as to give to it a different character? He re-
fers it to Congress for consideration, among those
mean  "authorized by the Constitution," through
which they may " provide a remedy against a de-
preciated paper currency " As such it was re-
ferred to the Judiciary committees in both Houses
of Congres  The m ljortty of members composing
each of the^e committees was fuendly to the Admi-
nistration, (and I w as of the number,) yet they did
not report m its favor, or introduce any bill upon
the subject
As to an exclusive metallic currency being aimed
at by the Admmistiation and its friends, I consider
the charge as wholly gratuitous, and unfounded
A sound mttallic basis for paper issued upon it,
and a paper at all times convertible into specie, is
all I have heard contended for The truth is, we
are charged with being for an exclusive metallic
currency because we are not in favor of paper not
convertible in to specie. It is true, many of us, my-
self I among the number, are in favor of banr-hm?
small notes from c rculation, th?t their places may
be supplied bj specie for the ordinary daily tran-
sactions of life
I have said this wai an extiaordmary letter, and
it seems to me that every thing attending and con-
nected with it partakes of the same character It
is addressed to the Hon John Q. Adams whose
opinion upon this whole subject had again and
again been expressed, under circumstances much
more favorable to the bank than those which now
exist In a written addresi made to some of his consti-
tuents, immediately after the suspension in May last,
when speaking in reference to this same bank, he
says "I incline more strongly to the opinion, that
ihc suspension of specie payments by such a bank
should not only operate as an immediate forfeituie
of its charter, but be made a penal offence m the
president and directors of the institution. The
violation of moral principle committed by a bank
in suspending «pecie payments is, in my estimation,
not inferior to that of fiaudulent bankruptcy m an
individual "
In another letter, of July 1, 1837, Mr Adams
again observes, on this subject
"We are now told that all the banks m the United
States have suspended spec e payments And
what is the susoensioi of specie piyments but set-
ting the laws of propeity at defiance? If «he pre-
sident and directors of a bank have issued a mil-
lion of bills, promising to pay fve dollars to the
holder of each and every oneof them, the suspen-
sion of specie payments is by one act the bieach of
one million of promis-es What is th.s but fraud
upon every holder of their billsi And what differ-
ence is theie between the president and directors oí
such a bank and the skilful aitist nho engravs a
bank bill, a/ac nn lie of the bill signed bv the pie-
s den. ard doctors, and saves them the trt uul' of
sluing it by doirg it for them' Tie only differ-
ence I can see in the two opeiations is, that the
artist g ves evidence of supenoi skill and superior
modesty It requires more talent to sign another
man's name than one's own, and the counteifeiter,
at least, does his work in the dark, while the sus-
penders of specie p™jment bnzen it in the face of
day, and laugh at the victims and dupes who have
pat faith in their promises "
Now sir, is it not among the most strange and
extraordinary thing§,cona^9ted wtfh this fetter, that
it should be deliberately addressed to a person
who has deliberately eipressed these sentiments',
and one who, it is underwood, has seldom, if ever,
retracted one word íhat hechas uttered in his whole
life, or changed an opinion deliberately expressed.
I have now done, with the letter of Mr. Biddle.
I wijl proceed to the discission of the proposi-
tions involved m the bill before the Senate. The
first is, Joes Congress possess th« constitutional
power to act upon this subjeet in the manner pro-
posed?
This bill contains two provision*. The first
prohibits the reissue of the potes of an ex-
pired corporation created by Congress, and
inflicts a punishment upon all those entrust-
ed with the settlement of the affairs of such
corporation, for a violation of this provision
It should here be remarked, that the penalties im-
posed, apply only to persons having the possession
of notes of an expired corporation for the purpose
of settlement, and whose duty it is to destroy or
cancel them, and not to persons who receive and
pass them in the ordinary course of business. Fur-
ther, this provision is altogether prospective, what-
ever improprieties or wrongs may have been com-
mitted, are passed by unnoticed, because Congress
has no power to notice them The second provi-
sion is, that when the charter of any corporation
created by Congress shall have expired, and the
United States may have been a stockholder, and
the notes of such corporation Shall be m the pos-
session of any corporation or person entrustra with
the settlement of the affairs of such corporation, the
circuit courts of the United States^hall have a
power, by injunction, to prevent the reissue of such
notes, and, by a decree, may cause them to be can-
celled This is all that is proposed If I am
asked if I have been able to find any precedent for
such legislation, I answer frankly, I know of none,
and for the obvious reason that no such transac-
tions as those which call for this legislation have
ever before occurred. Never before, so far as I
can learn, has a corporation attempted to perpetu-
ate itself after the expiration of its charter. Never
has this, or any other country, witnessed the reissue
of the paper of a bank, after it has ceased to exist.
Therefore it is nota matter of wonder that no such
legislation is to be found, inasmuch asno case call-
ing for it has taken piace. The course taken by
the late bank has been of so extraordinary and un-
precedented a character, that no human foresight
could provide against it. We have all read of an
ancient sect of philosophers, who believed that after
death, the souls of men passed into other bodies,
and continued on earth But that a creature with-
out a soul, after the termination of its existence
should pass into another state of being, and remain
upon earth, is what no philosopher or statesman
ever imagined. The Congress of 1816 supposed
that when they declared that the charter should
continue for twenty years, and no longer, and that
two years after that time should be allowed for
winding np its affairs, there would be an end to the
corporation they had created, and every thing
connected with it They therefore made no provi-
sion for that state of things which now exists It
is upon principle and analogy alsne that this bill
can be sustaired
Th* first section makes the issuing of the old
notes by the pejsons therein described, and for the
purposes mentioned, a criminal offence, and pre-
scribes the punishment The Constitution, arti-
cle 3, seetnn 2, declares "that the judicial power
shall extend to all cases in law and m equ'ly
?n-.mg under th s Constitution or the laws of the
United States " Cases m law are either cr il or
criminal, according to their nature and the provi-
sions of law applicable to them. Article 1, sec S,
gives Congress "power to pass all laws which shaU
be necessary and proper for carrying into efi c> the
enumerated powers, and all other powe.s v ested m
the Government of the Uni'ed States «r m any
department thereof." Consequen*'y, whenever a
case antes under a law of the United States, w
which it is nect s^ii i or proper, in the opinion of
Congicss, trial the judicial powei should be ap-
plied, they can pass the laws requisite to give the
courts jurisdiction, and to enable the    jtfoeeed
