Mr POPE expressed a hope that the House
would at once act upon the bill, without further
discussion.
Mi. WATMOUGH said he had hoped that
the bill, as modified, and since presented by him
to the House, in which the vauous amendments
had beenm part imbodied, would have met with
•general concurrence , and he aKo hoped the House
would come to a decision at once
Mr. POPE said he could not accept the modifi-
cations proposed, but must insist on his amend-
ment.
Mr WISE was opposed to that part of the
amendment to recommit, with ínstiuotions, and
would rather vote against the whole bill
Mr HARDIN was of the same opinion
Mr .WATMOUGH wished to know if it was
necessaiy that the bill should go again into Com-
mittee of the Whole
The CHAIR replied m the affhmative
Mr. GRENNELL remaiked, that inasmuch ns
the bill was now stripped of all its objectionable
featuies, and would produce a great saving to the
country, almost $100 000 a year, he had hoped no
objections would have been urged
Mr FILLMORE askfd for a division of the
question
Mr BEAUMONT moved to lay the motion to
recommit, &c , on the table
Mr GRENNELL asked for the yeas and
nays, which were ordered
X'he question was then taken and decided in the
negative—yeas 75, nays 132
The question then leournng on recommitting
the bill,
Mi. POPE proposed to modify his mstiuctions
to the committee, so as to except, in the proposi-
tion to stuke out, that part allowing ten cents per
mile when under travelling orders, and proposing
also to raise the pay of Captains on foreign sei-
vice to J4 000
Mr GILLET said the new bill, subsequently
printed, would conflict with the above amend-
ments. If the bill went into (omnittee with the
instructions proposed, their hands would be so
tied up that they would be unable to make ti e
bill as perlect as was desired lie hoped the bill
would be recommitted with instructions.
Mr   HARDIN aKo expiessed the same wish
Mr GILLET then ofleied the following amend-
ment to the bill •
"Stuke out from line 191 to the end of the bill,
and inset t the following • '1 hat no allowance shall
hereafter be mode to any officer, or peison em-
ployed in the naval seivice of the United Slates,
foi «rawing bills, for receiving or disbuismg
money, oi transacting any business for the Gov ei n-
ment of the United States, noi shall he be allowed
servants, or pay foi seivants, or clothing or ra-
tions foi them, or pay for the same, nor shall any
allowance be made to him for rent of quarters, oi
m pav rent for furniture, or for lights or fuel, oi
tor tiavellmg expenses oi transporting baggage,
nor shall any such officer or person be allowed
.o transport, oi aid in transporting, for pay, any
specie or property for any peison ]t is hereby
sxpressly declared that the yeaily allowance pro-
vided in this act is all the pay, compensation, and
illowance that shall be received underany circum-
stances whatever, by any such officer or person "
Mr POPE agreed to accept it as a modification
to his instructions
Some conversation ensued on the subject of this
amendment, conflicting with the other, between
the CHAIR, Messrs JONES, GILLET, and
WATMOUGH, and Mi POPE expressed a
wish to withdiaw his acceptance
The question was then taken on lecommitting
the bill,and agieed to
The question was then taken on recommitting
the bill with mstiuctions     Negativtd
The House then, on motion of Mr WAT-
MOUGH, resolved itself into a Committee of the
Wnole on the stateof the Union, (Mr Bbiggsio
the chair )
Mr POPE then proposed his amendment as
modified.
Mr. WISE proposed to amend the same by
fixing the pay of captains in foreign seivice at
$4,000, when on other duty, $3,500, when off
duty, $2,500
Mr WISE made a few remarks in favor of his
amendment, contending that by the amendment
offered by Mr POPE, there was no increase
whatever m the pay of the naval officers Mr
W. hoped his own woula be adopted as the
smallest possible increase that could leasonably
be adopted
Mi  JONES said a few words in reply
Mi FOSTER said, if much time was con-
sumed in committee, the bill would be lost in the
House
Mi   BATES opposed the original amendment
Mi GRENNELL said that nine hundred and
fifty out of eveiy thousand officers were satisfied
with the amendment as offered by the gentleman
from Kentucky
Mr WATMOUGFI hoped the whole ground
was not to be gone over again.
Mr MASON, of Vnginia, hoped the amend-
ment of his colleague would be adopted in lieu of
the gentleman's fiom Kentucky, because by the
latter an officei who had been thirty five yeais in
the service, would receive only five hundred
dolíais more than one who had only served five
years.
After a few further remarks from Mr C P.
WHITE and Mr JONES, the question on the
amendment was taken—ayes 68, noes 24 No
quorum voting
Mr HARPER made a few observations in
favor of the increased pay
Mr. MANN .said if the amendment of the gen-
tleman fiom Vnginiashould be rejected, he would,
as an act of justice to that meritorious class of
persons embraced in the bill, renew the proposi-
tion heretofore offered by the gentleman from
Maine, [Mi   Jakvis ]
The question was again taken on Mr Wise's
amendment, when there appeared—ayes 72, noes
40
Still no quorum voting, tellers were demanded,
and, on the division, there were—ayes 79, noes
4G
So the emendment was agieed to
The question then recurred on the amendment
as amended, which was agreed to without a di-
vision
Mr POPE moved to insert an amendment in
relation to the mileage of officers when travelling
under orders.
Mr GILLET heie moved his amendment, as
printed nbove
Mr G  explained that his object was to confine
officers in all respects to then salanes     An idea
had  been advanced, on a former occasion, by a
gentleman fiom Rhode Island, [Mr PEARCEJ,thit
1 officers ought to  receive an extia allowance for
the tran-portation of specie, which Mr G thought
very objectionable
]     The CHAIRdecided this amendmentnotto be
| in order at that time
The question was then taken on Mr Pope's
amendment, and there appeared—ayes 85, noes
16
No quorum voting, it was taken again by tellers,
and theie were—ayes>85, noes 35
So the amendment was adopted
I Mr. .TARVIS then called the attention of the
I committee to the following provision for suigeons
i of the Navy, "and when appointed to peiform
the duties of surgeon general, his pay shall be in-
I creased thiee fourths "
Mr J moved to strike out this provision, be-
cause there was in fact no such officer as that
of surgeon general known m the service, and an
appiopriation bill was not the place for creating
such an office
Mr.   WATMOUGH explained.   The service
had suffered greatly for the want of a su geon
general, and he hoped the provibion would not be
stricken out
The question was taken, and theie appeared—
ayes 60, noes 55
Mr JARVIS withdrew his motion, whereupon
Mr. MANN, of New York, renewed it, and the
amendment was agreed to—ayes 95, noes not
counted
Mi WISE moved that the committee rise and
report the bill to the House
Mi GILLET then renewed I113 amendment.
Negatived—ayes 61, noes 69.
Mi JACKSON, of Massachusetts, then moved
to amend the clause for the piovision for officers
on furlough, entitling them to receive two-thirds of
the pay to which they would have been entitled if
on leave of absence, by striking out " two thuds,"
and inserting " one-half "   Agreed to
Mr GILLET moved to stuke out the following
clause "Officers tempoianly performing duties
belonging to those of a higher giade, shall receive
the compensation allowed to such higher grade
while actually so employed "
Mr C P WHITE opposed the motion
Mr. MANN, of New York, was in favor of the
motion The officers 111 our seivice should re-
ceive a pay corresponding to their rank, and no
more.
Mr BURGES opposed the amendment
Mr. JONES remarked, that the provision, as it
stood, would go to pay two officers for peiform-
ing the same duty, and he hoped the amendment
would be adopted
Mr CLAY said, to him it mattered not what
might be the grade of an officer, if he performed
the duty of a higher grade than his own, he ought
to be paid accordingly. If a lieutenant performed
the duty of a commander, he was equitably enti-
tled to a commander's pay, for the time he was so
employed
The question was then taken on the amendment
—ayes 34, noes 82, no quorum. It was again
taken by tellers, when there appealed—ayes 8,
noes 96     Still no quorum voting.
The CHAIR ascertained that there was a quo-
rum in the House, and the amendment vvas then
negatived, without a division
Mr JARVIS then moved to amend the follow-
ing provision of the bill by striking out "Lieu-
tenants commanding, §1,800, on other duty,
¿.1,500, waning orders, $ 1,200, "and inserting in
lieu thereof the following "Lieutenants com-
manding on duty ove  ten years' seivice, $1,500;
undei ten years' service, and on duty, $1,200,
waiting orders, $1,000." Negatived without a
division
Mr JARVIS then moved to amend the fo'low-
mg clause: " Passed midshipmen on duty, $750,
waiting orders, $600," by mseiungm lieu of those
sums, respectively, $600 for the former, and $500
for the latter    Negatived without a division
On motion of Mr WARD, the committee then
rose and reported the bill, with the amendments,
to the House
Mr JONES then moved to amend the two
clauses relatina to the pay of captains, and asked
for the yeas and nays, not ordered—ayes 28, noes
129
The amendment was then negatived without a
division
The other amendments agreed to in committee
weie then concurred in by the House
Mr GILLET then proposed the amendment to
the House which he had submitted in Committee
of the Whole, in relation to allowances • Mr G
urged its adoption on the principle that it vvas best
to allow officers a fixed salary than subject them
to the eontn genries of mduect and extra allowance,
and asked for the yeas and nays, which were
ordered
Mr McKIM opposed the amendment, and
asked how could the merchants call upon and ex-
pect captains of ships of-war to bung home specie
from South America, unless they were paid foi it,
and in case of war, how could its safety be ensured
by any other conveyance.
Mr GILLET said his amendment was not con-
fined to the allowance incident to the transporta-
tion of specie alone
Mr McKIM still thought the amendment ob-
jectionable, as that was one of the most important
