LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 5, 1864.

General B. BRAGG, Richmond, Va.:

In my dispatch in regard to operatives this morning it is for the authorities to decide what troops shall be sent here. Whatever forces are sent, I shall use them in the best manner possible to defeat our enemy. You may feel assured that I know the necessity of troops at different points, and will co-operate thoroughly with you in doing the best that can be done. It is necessary for me to give battle should the enemy continue to advance. Let me know what forces I can have.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Very respectfully,
