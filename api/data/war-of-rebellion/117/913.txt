WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, October 9, 1862.

ANDREW PARKS, Esq., AND OTHERS,

Charleston, Kanawha County, Va.

GENTLEMEN: I have received your letter requesting that Captain C. N. Goulding, one of General Pope's officers, may be placed on the footing of an ordinary prisoner of war. In reply you are respectfully informed that General Pope's officers have been exchanged, the United States Government having given assurance that his obnoxious orders were no longer in force.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,October 9, 1862.

Honorable G. W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War.

GENERAL: The prisoners taken by Colonel Imboden were sent to Richmond instead of being paroled because the enemy hold some of his men as prisoner and it is said refuse to parole soldiers belonging to the partisan corps. They had better be retained I think until the determination of the enemy in this regard is definitely ascertained.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

[Indorsement.]

OCTOBER 14.

Send copy to Robert Ould, esq., and direct him to inform the enemy's agent that prisoners taken by the partisan corps will not be exchanged until the enemy consent to exchange the partisans.
