A bill (S. No. 367) in relation to the duties of

The motion to postpone the bills indefinitely
was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 1,) to divide the State of Pennsylvania into
three judicial districts, and to establish a district
court, to be held in the city of Erie, reported ad-
versely thereon.
Mr. NESMITH,from the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs and the Militia, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (H. R. No. 694) for the relief of
Lieutenant "William P. Richner, seventy-seventh
regiment Ohio volunteer infantry, reported it
â– without amendment.
Mr. HxVRDING,from the Committee on Pub-
lic Lands, to whom was referred the memorial of
the board of trustees of Virginia City, Nevada
Territory, praying for a grant of the lands within
the corporate limits of that city, not exceeding
two miles square,for the use and benefit ofthein-
habitants of that city, reported adversely thereon.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of David II. Burr, late
surveyor general of Utah, praying compensation
for services tendered and expenses incurred for
taking care of books, papers, and property be-
longing to that office, reported adversely thereon.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was recommitted the bill (S. No, 208) making a
donation of lands to the States of Wisconsin and
Michigan, to aid them in making a military road
and telegraph line in said States, reported it with
amendments.
Mr. HARDING. The same committee, to
whom was referred the petition of Robert Coles,
of Lucas county, Iowa, praying compensation
for services lendered as register of the land office
at Clmnton, Iowa, and the employment of an ad-
ditional clerical force in said office, have instructed
mc to report adversely. In this case, while the
committee are of opinion that there are u large
number of persons of this class in the .Northwest
who should be relieved, they are not inclined to
grant relief of the nature asked for in this petition.
gunboat cairo.
Mr. GRIMES. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs, to whom was referred the
joint resolution (H. R. No. 144) to compensate
the sailors on the gunboat Cairo for loss of cloth-
ing, to report it back without amendment, and rec-
ommend its passage. It is a very small matter,
giving to the sailors on that boat fifty dollars
apiece for loss of clothing, which is the usual com-
pensation in such cases; and I ask the unanimous
consent of the Senate to consider it now.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
joint resolution. It authorizes the proper account-
ing officers of" the Treasury, in settling the ac-
counts of the petty officers, seamen, sailors, and
others of the crew of the United States gunboat
Cairo, to allow to each a sum not exceeding fifty
dollars as a remuneration for the damage they may
have sustained in the loss of their clothing by the
destruction of the vessel in December last.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate
without amendment, ordered to a third reading,
read the third time, and passed.
wisconsin ciiicitit court.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committeeonthe Ju-
diciary, to whom was referred the amendment of
the House of Representatives to the bill of the
Senate (S. No. 407) to fix the terms of the circuit
court in the distuct of Wisconsin, have directed
me to report it back with a recommendation that
the bill he on the table. There is now no necessity
for i ts passage,
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will ask the honorable
Senator to allow that bill to he recommitted to the
Committee on the Judiciary. The times of hold-
ing the circuit court in the State of "Wisconsin
were fixed on consultation with Judge Davis,
then the judge of that circuit. Since that time,
however, Wisconsin has been attached to the
ninth circuit, of which Judge Miller is the circuit
judge; and, on consultation with him last evening,
I ascertained the times when he could hold the
courts in the State of Wisconsin. I have that
information which I desiie to give to the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary; and I ask my honorable
friend from Illinois, therefore, to have the bill re-
committed to the committee in order that they
may draw an amendment which will cover the
case.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It is impossible to do it
upon this bill. This bill passed the Senate and
went to the House of Representatives. The House
passed it with an amendment; and, as I under-
stand it, the question now is on concurring in the
amendment of the House of Representatives. Per-
haps we could concur in it with another amend-
ment; but it seems to me it would be better to in-
troduce a new bill; and as the original bill will not
now answer the purpose, we had better let it lie
on the table. The question now is on concurring
with the House of Representatives in the amend-
ment which tiiey have made.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I suppose we can concur
with an amendment, and that amendment might
cover the whole case.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Foot in
the chair.) The motion is that the bill lie on the
table, and Senators are aware that the motion is
not debatable.
Mr. TRUMBULL. 1 am not particular about
this matter. I think the Senator can get at it
easier, and with less trouble, by introducing a dis-
tinct bill. There will be 110 difficulty in passing
a bill to fix a time tor holding the courts in that
State.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I shall not object to this
bill lyingon the table with the undeistanding that
I can call it up if an amendment can be made to
cover the case.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is subject to
be called up at any time.
The bill, with the amendment, was ordered to
lie on the table.
appeals and writs of error.
Mi. TRUMBULL. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill (S. No.
51G) to allow the United States to prosecute ap-
peals and writs of error without giving security,
have directed me to report it back without amend-
ment, and recommend its passage. It is a short
bill, and will be understood by the mere reading
of it, and I ask for its present consideration.
By unanimous consent the bill was considered
as in Committee of the Whole, it provides that
whenever any writ of error, appeal, or other pro-
cess in law, admiralty, or equity, shall issue from
or be brought up to the Supreme Court of the
United States, either by the United States or by
direction of any Department of the Government,
no bond, obligation, or security shall be required
ft om the United States, or from any party acting
under the direction of any Department, by any
judge or ch-rk of a court, either to prosecute the
suitor to answer in damages or costs. In case
of an adverse decision, such costs as are by law
taxable against the United States are to be paid
out of the contingent fund of the Department
under whose direction the proceedings have been
instituted.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered to
be engrossed for a third reading, read the third
time, and passed.
