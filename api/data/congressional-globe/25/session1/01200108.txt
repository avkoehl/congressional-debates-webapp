tteman from Kentucky, (Mr Underwood,) and
might, therefore, possibly offer considerations to the
House similar to those that had been presented If
so, he should ¡regret it, for he did not desire to ex-
lend our sessions, and weary the patience of the
House, by repeating arguments which had been
submitted over and over again. He would prefei
to be a silent spectator of the scene, whenever the
teasons upon which his trote was to be based had
been assigned by other gentlemen in the debate
The amendment before the House presents
two propositions to be decided What are we
about to <kfl Let a direct answer be given,
there is na necessity for disguise Congress is
about to act tor a people having intelligence
■enough to understand distinctly the position
¡n which the country is placed, and patriotism to
sancton and sustain any measures called for by
the public interest Gentlemen are deceived if
ihey suppose that the true s'ate of the Treasury is,
in need be, made a myslerv The whole country
knows that the Secretary of the Treasury has not at
command available mean1- It is not pretended
hotyevei that the publie money has been wasted
or unwisely or illegally expended It is where
fo igress ordered it, should be placed. But the
holders of this treasme, in vio'ation of public
law, and of their own solemn contracts, refuse to
pay n in legal currency. This being the case, mo-
ney must be borrowed by the United States to com-
ply with their engagements until the contracts of
those selfish and refractory corp nations have been
enfoiced This ihe amendment offered bv the
gentleman p eposes to do, fir t, by authority of ihe
Secretary, to issue drafts on th<" deposite banks
This measure, 1 had supposed, would not be
ofkred again by any one who had witnessed a
scene which could not hat e es< aped the attention
of every member pre ent After the bill to post-
pone the deposite of the fourth instalment under
the act of 18J6 was ordeied to be engrossed for a
third leading, two members of the House, (one
fjom Kentucky, and the other fiom Louisiana,)
who had opposed that bill m all its stages, pro-
posed to postpone its lmal passage until afier the
House had disposed of the bill from, the S-nate
giving indulgence to the deposite banks. They
appeared to be suddenly seized by the conviction
that there was an intimate connection between those
two measuies This, sir, the President well knew
u hen we assembled Hence he recommended a post-
ponement of the deposite This, also the majority of
this House well undei stood at the commencement of
the session Unless the Treasury was relieved
from ihe obligation to make the deporte with the
fatite , we foiesaw tint no indulgence whatever
could be given I o the dpposile banks The balances
dm b) them to the United States must, m tint
( vent, have been immediately col'ected, or con-
verted into fund-> that would be received at par bj
all the St ties, m exch-inge for their several bonds,
01 certificates oí depos t • Hence we, the majority
ol the House, strugg ed day alt i day to pass the
lull postponing fie depos te of the fourth m tal-
meiit, and we have succeeded, I regret to
all, sn, wilh< ut the aid of many gea'h-
men representing Slates m which dep isite
banks aie located, having a large amount
ot public mo ley duo from them to tie Un ltd
Suit -j and due to then bv the people of tho e
Suites Now sir, is there the sl¡ghlest leasonbr
supposing that the majority of this House w ill
Uiange tl eir -Mi pose We have relieved the Tre i-
s 11 v oí the United Stales from the oneious respon-
sib htv t nt «e might indn'go th  ('eposite banks,
, nd triable them t> indu ge m turn th"ir debtors
Whin thebillfoi that purpose comes up toi consi 1c-
i at ion, these who voted for the bill to postpoie the
(Upo Ue, «ill vole to give time to the banks, and

pr tlit *, eenfi lentlv, to accept (or their constitu-
e its the advantages w Inch Congress can now
comementh oler But theie can be no necessity
for this di tail Tber  is not an intell gent mcmbei
of tins House who doubts about the passage of a
law lo 0ivc time to the drpi site banks.    As lo the
extent of time to be given, there are, and will be,
different opinions. But time will be granted. This
being known, of what value are all those tabular
statements which gentlemen have exhibited to the
House and to the country, showing the amount of
money m those banks'? These columns of figures
serve but to obscure a question otherwise clear of
all serious difficulty We intend, by law, to re-
lease the banks from all obligation to pay any part
of the money at this time. We intend, in effect, to
pass this money out oí the Treasury, and give abs >-
lute control over it to the directors of the bank 
for a limited time, and to receive in lieu there-
of the bonds of the banks Has not then this
House passed several weeks m a most unprofitable
debate, mtrnded to determine precisely the amount
of these funds? We aie looking for available
means m the Treasury now, ai this time, not next
year, and gentlemen who undertake to aid the
House m its deliberation, go off into a labyrinth of
figures to determine the amount of a fund which
all admit will not be in the Treasury «hen this
House adjourns. I have considered this deba'e in
a great degtee—u ith unfeigned respect toi the able
gentlemen who have participated in it I fay so—a
useless and unprofitable consumption of prec ons
houis It gentlemen who have opposed the mea-
sures recommende I by the administration, had pro-
posed to deposite with the States the bonds we are to
reee vefiom thedeposile banks, I could havecompie-
hended fully what they were at And if they would
now submit a motion to amend the bill before ns, so
as to authorize the use of the bonds we an. to receive
from the banks, to pay the debts of the Govern-
ment, this object would be direct and easy to be
understool by the countty Instead oi this, we
hive had proposition after piopoaiuon, requiring
theTieasurer to issue draft* for funds which we all
know will not be subject to draft after we shall
have passed, as we will pass, the bt'ls before us
These movem=nts may satisfy a small, a ven
small portion of the people, but the great mass
of the community can not but condemn any
attempt to leave the Government without other
means to comply with the public engagements but
Treasuiy drafts, that we know will not be paid, and
which we, by law, intend to say shall not be paid, on
demand. Such a proceeding would be ridiculous in
in the extreme. We all know that thediafts of the
Tieasurer, heretofore issued, have been dishonored
by the banks, and protested for non-payment We
know, too, that these drafts are in the market be-
low the value of gold an 1 silver, the standard by
which all legal tenders, in payment of debts, is to
be testpd Woul I it not, uij r such circumstan-
ces, be discieditable to Congress to adjourn with-
out providing belter means than depreciated Trea-
sui} drafts to pay the debts of the people of tne
United States'

INQUIRY IN RCLVrtON TO THE TIOlUDA WAR
The House ihen proceeded to the unfimshetl bu-
siness of the morning hour, which was the conside-
ration of the following resolution, submitted by
Mr Wise on the 19 th of September
Resolved, That a select committee be appointed
by ballot to inquire into the cause of the Florida
war,and into the causes of the delays and failures,
and the expenditures which have attended the pio-

going resolution, bv striking out all liter the word
" resolved," and insert the following
"That a select committee be pppointed to inqiuie
into the cause of the Florida war, and the caúsese f
thp extraordinary delavs and failuies, anl the ex-
penditures which hi\i> attended the pios cution of

Mr LOOMIS, of New Yotl , who was occupy-
ing the floor when this subiect was last up, and
intenupted hy 'he orders of the day, resumeel hts
remarks, and said That, when this matter was
last undei consideration, he had commenced some
observations m vindication of his piedecessor,
(Abijnh Mann, jr) fiom the censures cast upon
htm by the gentleman from Virginia. He hsd
c haracten/ed the attack made upon his predecessor,
six months after occurrences had transpired, and
when the circumstances of the parties had entirely
changed, as extraordinary and, in his view, entire-
ly uniustifiable,and he was about proceeding, when
interrupted, to show that no censure could be im-
pute 1 to his predecessor, even from the statement
of the gentleman from Virginia himself He was
well aviate that he might leave the character of his
predecessor to its own vindication whetever it was
known, and if he had not some observations which
he wished to submit on anothti bianih oí  the sub-
