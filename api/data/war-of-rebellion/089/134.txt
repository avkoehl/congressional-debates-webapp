Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

A deserter has just come in from the Twenty-seventh North Carolina, MacRae's brigade; says that he came on picket yesterday evening and would have been relieved to-night; that when he came out all of Heth's division was here, and he thinks two brigades at least of Wilcox. Thinks that if there had been any movement of Heth's division he would have known it.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Potter is advancing his line; reports the enemy has very materially increased his skirmish line. General Willcox moved out toward Hawks'. His advance within 400 yards of rebel redoubt; found a working party there, which has retired. He will make a demonstration on the redoubt. I don't think it can be occupied by any force.
