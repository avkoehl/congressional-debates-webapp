HEADQUARTERS RENDEZVOUS FOR DRAFTED MEN.,Philadelphia, Pa., December 4., 1863

SIR: I have just seen a copy of Major-General Pope's report of the campaign in Virginia in 1862. General Pope says (p. 20):

I submit herewith the reports of Generals King, Gibbon, and Doubleday of the action of the evening of the 28th.

No such reports appear in the published documents, and General McDowell says he received none such.

I am at a loss to understand why these reports have been withheld, but it is very certain that had they been published several erroneous statements in General Pope's report would have been corrected,and I should not have felt called upon to correct them now. Although the brigade which I then commanded has since made itself a name for gallantry and discipline which cannot be tarnished by any erroneous statements, yet I think justice requires that its conduct during its first action on the 28th of August should be correctly set forth. As this has not been done through my regular official report, made out and forwarded to division headquarters at the time, I respectfully request that if that report cannot be found and published as a part of the record of that campaign this communication may be published in its stead.

Had my report been published it would have appeared that, instead of "King's division" having a sever action with the advance of Jackson, as stated by General Pope, my single brigade was left almost along to sustain itself against a division of the enemy, and that the division as such was not engaged at all: that in place of being "supported handsomely by Doubleday's brigade," but two regiments of that brigade came to our assistance, and then only when the brigade commander had been repeatedly urged to send them by my staff officers, and the late Major-General Reynolds, who came upon the ground during the fight.
