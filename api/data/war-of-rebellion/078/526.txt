GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. AND ARMY OF THE TENN., Numbers 31. East Point, Ga., September 29, 1864.

Captain W. Bedford, assistant adjutant-general, U. S. Volunteers, is announced on duty at these headquarters. He will be respected and obeyed accordingly.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:

WM. T. CLARK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,East Point, Ga., September 29, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM VANDEVER,

Commanding District of Marietta, Ga.:

GENERAL: I am convinced that some reformation in the condition of affairs at Marietta is necessary. I desire you to institute a system of vigilant pickets and patrols, by which you will be seasonably informed if the enemy come within a distance of three miles. The provost marshal's department will also need some special attention from yourself. I desire that there be no unarmed soldiers lounging about the railroad station; that no sales of liquors to soldiers be allowed; that no houses be occupied by officers or soldiers, unless properly authorized by the quartermaster's department, and all parties occupying houses should be able to show written authority to do so from the post quartermaster. I have heard that the post commander at Acworth sometimes indulges too freely in drink. A hint from you will, I trust, be sufficient to remedy this evil. You are, of course, on detached service, yet most of the troops under your command belong to this army, and as their commander I am interested, as well as yourself, in their maintaining a high character.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 29, 1864.

General McARTHUR,

Marietta:

I want the party on Kenesaw to be very wide awake and arrange the old parapet so as to resist any sudden attack of our enemy, and you should all be on your guard. It is reported the enemy is crossing the Chattahoochee to the west.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: Watch out well for the first appearance of infantry over about Cedartown, and let me know.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
