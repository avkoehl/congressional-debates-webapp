Duel Reports.—Mr. Menefee.
H. of Beps.
made by the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
He tells ud that heie js no time for trial, to enter upon which
would be wholly incompatible with a proper despatch of the
public business No time for trial1 said he i?ir, when di 1
the gentleman make that discovery1? Was not the state oí the
public business and of the Treasury fully known, all along, to
the gentlemen who originated this inquiry, and by whom it S as
been piessed, the chairman himself amongst them? ¡No one
will doubt it All therefore, who conti lbuted to set this, inquiry
onfoit intended^ I am justified m prorouncmg, that it should
thus con^ct with the discharge by this House of other public
dunes, for they foresaw—must have foreseen—from the first,
the direction which it was eventually to take, which was,
formal trials, separately, before the House—with accusei con
fronting the accused, aid witnesses face to face with parties—
of each member against whom any accusation should be made
or punishment aimed Indeed, raising acommittee oí itself,
impliedsuch final action, foi the oiheeofa committee is but
preliminary, preparatory to the action of the House, and its
acts are nugatory exceptas conducing to such ulterior action
Mi looked to the committee as the means, the end of which was
the action of the House Thi=> couise of proceeding, neverthe
less, presented, at that time, no obstacle
Has any thing intervened since tins inquiry was thus msti
tuted, disclosing the impracticability of its lurther piosecution'7
Are we to understand, from the position which the gentlema i
holds, that in what he has just uttered aie presented the
wishes of the Administration and the intention of its luends
here, respecting this subject, namely, to urge it to the po nt of
a report, involving, to the deepest degree, the chaiaoteis of dis
tingutshed gentlemen of the Opposition, memoeis ol tne House,
and suspending o\ or them resolutions of censuie and expul
sion.and then to arre«t the proceedings altogether? In other
words, to raise acommittee, and employ it 101 two months m
preparing accusations and elaborating aiguments against gen
tiemen, with a view to ¡¡nomulgation, and now ictnally pro
mulgated,aHover the Republic, and then, by instantly arrest
mg the proceedings, to depuve the accused ofthe opportunity
of vindication in the regular course of investigation and trial1
No time1 Su, th°y have found time, the amp'es time, to
accuse, to criminate, have tney not time to hear ind ti>? Ihey
can, without the slightest prejudice to the pub ic rnteiot incul
pate, have they po time to heai evidence in defence and t \cul
pation?   If there- time iorealumn), none foi tuith?
I admit, su, that a disposition of these pioceedmgs m the
onlyjusUnable modo—after full oppoi Hinity of defence -y\i!l
conflict with thejust demands ofthe pubuc mteie«t Thoü pio
seoutiunupto this point has aheady pioduce ! such conihet
But thi-> does not at ail piovo tha they should be ^.n este i i ow,
having already gone so far but it n ay piove hit they shut
never have been instituted As a que tiun oí ¡ rivilege ih s c\

gent The Treasury, now scarcely sus aimng ltseli may so n
foi want of supplies, close against the public creditors, to the
infinite prejudice ofthe public credit Other alarming cmbar
rassments may overtake the Government Yet, su, should
such results appear, they will be ascubable altogether, m their
fullest measuie ef responsibility, to thef¡tends of the Admiwvs
tration themselves, with whom these proceedings originated I
desire to enforce upon the House and the country the truth,
which no gentleman here will venture to contradict, that this
measure, m its commencement, progress, and consequences, is
a measuie ofthe A lends ofthe Wtnmistiation, deslffned at *h
hazatd of great public injury, to attain objects tt wh.ch I shall
hereafter advert
Why, sir, what is the nature of the pioceeding m which the
House now finds itself involved* Foi fifty years the Govern
inent ha* existed under the piesent Constitmior m the lapse of
which, the nation has passed tluough all the vine, ituies of
peace and war, of pmspenty and adversity, oí tranqm lit j end
excitement, and all else, sav e civil war, (and that it nan scai ce y
escaped,) to which republics are exposed Yet our history is
without a precedent for this proceeding It is new, wholly new
It presents an epoch m that history, certainly an epoch m the
history of this House?   What is it?
On the 26th of February last, sir, the death ofthe Hoi Jona
tha«t Ciixey, a member from the State of Mame w¿3 an
nounceJ to the House by oneorhiscotieagues [Mi rAmriELn ]
and the customaiv funeral honois awaided Toi this there was
precedent Two days afteiwaids, however that same c dleague
ntroducediesoluttonspiop mingan investigation into the \ i^
which led to the death, and thecucvnistai cesatt ndirgu I oi
this there was no precedent Herein, the extiaoidn aiy iea
tures ofthe proceeding commenced
The gentleman frsm Maine and others now a sociated wi H
him maintain that the extraordinaiy natcie of 1'ie event wat
ianted and demanded such an extiaordmaiy nvestiganoi ■% r
extraordinary mwhat? It involved a duel between r lenbeis
ofthe House of Representatives Well, suppose it aid How
many such duels had pieviously occurred, publicl} an i nolo
nously? Need 1, air, enumerate the instances in which gentle
men, now members of this House, participated? It is m y am to
pretend that am solid distinction exists between those n Ma ¡u s
and the prese it, that death endued A om the latter The offence
so iai as this House is authored to íecogmse" consist" n the
challenge, its accepnnce, and the combat Ihe resu «, is w i "dlv
immaterial
But, sir, if the pio eeaing itself was extraoidi lary, it^ for n
was still more so It was a general vnqwiy it pon u i n
milling paiticulaily Its scope was net announce! it v as
believed by many who supported the resolutions, that thev v e«*e
designed merely to exhibit the lamentable event to which they
related muuch a liguas to insure the enactment by Gongre
of some law, or the adoption by this House of some iu¡c cdlcu
lated to suppi ess ¿he pi aclice, out of which it oi ignited 1 he
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Adams] has cleaily & gni
Red to the House that his mam purpose in suppoitmg the m
quirydidnotextend beyond such measuies and that it cojid n
no other aspect have commanded his support Othei gen le
men have declared the same sentiments Such, I am vva r ted
in saying were the sentiments ofthe House wlvnac'opii " the
resolutions
It is nevertheless now insisted by the mover ofthe resol \ ons
{Mr FadipibldJ and others, that such was no part of what wii
meditated, that they looked to that case only, and not to futuie
eas&s, that their object was the punishment of offe iders, and
that they aimed at members of this House The comma ee h iv e
manifestly proceeded with the same view, and; as appears fiom
the range of their investigation and the report they have offeied,
fcaving supposed their powers plenary to that end, br h a   t >
mattei sand persons, have acted up to that supposition The
repoi t which presents the results ol then operations is now sub
initted to the House, and the proposition immediately before us
is the printing of this report, and the pos ponement of us con
sideration for two weeks
This proposition, sir, is resided Amongst others, I resist it.
I admit, at the same time, that the course proposed is the cus
tomary course not to be deviated from without strong reason
Such reason, howe-er, does, m my opinion exist If it cannot
be shown io exisf I am quite willing that the customary course
shall be adhered to, and the pioposit on pievail On what
giounds, then, en, is the proposition resisted?
The gentleman from Virginia [Mi Robertson] maintains
that the action of the committee is wholly irregular and un
autho>ized that they had no power to extend meir investiga
turns as they have done, oi to icport what they have reported
Such too, is my opinion Should this view be just, it is plain
that the report should not be pimted, or, in any form, íeceive
the sinction oi countenance ofthe House, for if it be punted, it
must be for the purpose of ultenor use If it cannot, from its
obvious irregularity and defects, be used in any event, to print
it w-ijld be nugatory It would be worse it would operate as an
implied san< tion by the House of the lnegulaiity and defec «to
which I have referred I o prove, therefoie, that the whole
piocecdmgof the committee was irregular and destitute ofau
thonty fiom the House, i& t® pi ove that the íepoit ought not to
be printed    This I propose to piove
A committee uf he House oí Representatives havepiefet
rpd formal accusations against thiee membeis of his House
foi high delinquencies and have accompanied these accu&a
noi* with elaborate argumen s and a display of prool", closing
with resoiutK ns foi the expulsion of one artl the censure ol
others Had ihe committee the right oi power to picfer si ch
ccusations, is the tiue mquuy It it> naked!} a question of
power m the committee
I is no inconsiderahle matter <ur, with a citizen, especially
one occupying the staiion of a repiesentative of the people, to
lave an aecu«ation fiamed against him, and promutgated
among t Ins countiymen By a bare accusation his íeputa
tion which is a portion, and the best pomon, of all tint be
longs to him, is not only exposed to mjuiy butoftentime o ab

bung the House to a preliminary trial, m which the n embci
is entitled 10 be heard, not m his u ^bnce, for no ac 1 sation ex
ists, but to show, if ne can that he ougnt not to be accused
The point, sir, fiom which, in tne absence of the peemity
which I have stated, pernicious accusations mish he most
effectively aimed . t member  in through committees    Being
pait of die oigamzation of the House, the subjects embraced
by their sphere of duty are co extensive with the powers ofthe
House, and neaily with the transactions of life It wouid be
against uniform experience that committees, if armed with <m
accusing power, should not, m so wide a range, seize some oc-
casion to connect the names of members become-offensive by
their opposition, or formidable by their talents, with somede
hnquency, or abuse, or crime, and present them to their eoun*
trymer in the light of accused cutyrits^vih a view U> the de-
sti uction of then influence Such is the tendency of party
every where The principles on which committees of this
House are composed are notorious, they relate sir, as you know,
chiefly, if not altogether to the distribution of party honors, 01
the advancement of party ends As, therefore, the greatest
danger was to be apprehended from committees, so against
them protection has been most cautiously extended by the laws
of the House
Accordingly, sir, it is expressly provided in Jefferson's com
pilation of Parliamentary law, (adopted by our rules as the law
of the Mouse) that
When a committee is charged with an inquiry, if a mem
her prove to be involved, they cannot proceed aga nst ktm^
but must make a special report to the House whereupon, the
member is heai A m his place, or at the bar, 01 a special au-
thonty is given *o the committee to inquire concerning him "
feir can any thing be more explicit, directly applicable, or
decisive than this? Here the committee was charged with an
inquny, and ' a member proved to be involved ' This no
one contests Wnat then was the duty, the simple duty, ofthe
committee m that contingency? To "make a special report,"
unquestionably But they did not make such a repoi t "They
cannot proceed agemst a member Did the} pause, much
less stop short? No, snf but did proceed agamsL hmi to the
extreme point of re&o'u ions of expulsion' The member was
entitled 10 be heaid in his place at the bar ' He was not
heard 'A special authon }' was to have been give n to the
committee to mqunecoiicerning him " Yet it was not given,
ney er applied for I- this, su, in conformity to the law stated?-
No man of understanding I think, can suppose so It is the
exact opposite of tne law in every essental particular, and
that I had inagired ur il now, involved a violation of law
Sir, this law has not been answeied, and it cannot he an-
swered
I shall not, undertake to accourt for this extraordinary de-
portment of the committee That ihey have tianscended their
powetfe ma form disieputableto the House, and flagrantly in
j in ms and unjust to individuals, is plan The explanation
most compatible with then honor, in my opinion is ignoiance
of the extent of their powers and duües aid of the rights of
the House and us members lo suppose them advised of the
foregoing law limiting tl ose powers and duties, and defining
t! o'-e i gins is topionounce that they have wilfully trampled
it unlet foot fm pmposes which neither the House nor the
public wul be Pt a loss to discoyer Inadverterce on the one
hand and delibeiate outrage on the other, le before them I
lea\ e them to t! eir choice
I* is aprment however I think, sir that no matter by what
influence , smistei 01 upright, the committee weie impelled,
they h dno kr ow edge of tl e law which has been referí ed to
Indeed, one of the co prmttee the gentleman from Georgia,
[Mi Grantland ] has ¡cnt ted, verv conhallv, that he was
not informed oí the existence of such a l&w that he had no
suspicion that th0 circum&uinc^ of a membei being involved
cou'dopeiafeambiidgetnent of the powers of the committee,
that they pioceeded, fiom the" beginning, on the supposition
that those powers were plenary, and complains tha^ those who
now urge this law did not state it before the committee pro-
ceeded to act Wha* th t gentleman thus admits-, with respect
to himself, was douatles  true of his associates of the majority
who I regret have not di-played equi1 candor it might have
sp red the House mm h deba e That the law in question was
not piessed at ihe time, is leadily explained by reflecting that
no one hid a riaditto assume, in advance, that the committee
would violate it
1 he committee notwiths anding s ill persist in urging their
report uf on the House by laboring to reconcile then action
wihtheiaw now that it is known, nm that they aced in re-
ference to the Ktv but conloimedto it bj accideu al comci
dence' By what arguments SHi ¡s ¡illg new!} conceived pre-
til "e sought to he maintained?
It is contended tha* the committee were "¿peciaUy auiho
rfed by 'he House to proceed aga nst the members whom they
have ace i^ed hj ihe lesoltilions of &>ih of February, by
which the c <\ im ttee weie raised Look sir, at thes1 lesolu-
tiona    What are they?
Resolved That a committee, consisting of seven member*1,
bt appointed to 111 v&- igate the causes which lead to the death
oí the honoi able Jonathan Odie}, latean ember oí this House,
and the circun stances connected therewith and fuither, to in
qime whethei truchas been, in the case siluded to a breach
of t) "privileges of this House
Re^oUcd, That the said eommi tee be mstiucted to inquire
mt the means moic effectual!} to sunpressthe practice of duel.
}rt<r and report a bill for that purpose at as early a peiiodas may
1 racticable
Where sir in these resolu ions, is found & special authority
to 1 ro eed against member* 01 a special authonty of any
km1' Thej warrant, Í admit, an inquiry into a supposed
hi ecch of thp privileges of the House, but, in a form no more
special tivrn 11 cat-cs ol inquiry into any othei subject In all,
the subject of lrqtmv is stated as m th s but stated generally^
asm this Here no individual is ramed, no offence cnarged,
ei'her m lesprct to members orotheis Members ma\ have
been involved they may not This, hke any other sulject of
mvestigaton ma> h ve embraced the transactions of members,
it may not Eithei supposition is perfectly cons stent with the
teimsoi the resolution" Had the inqmrv becnmto supposed
abuses m the Indian affurs or the 1 abhc lands, instead of
bleach oí privilege the authority 10 ihe committee would have
1 er j eei=ely the same Tne s ih/a( of investiga iun wuuid
^tveheen specific, all else general "Yet, who would risk his
cnaiaciei foi irtcll geucc, bv mmtamuir m his place ttat,
urde- a. general inquny of the kind, the dehi quencies, real 01
fabricated of men hers f this House, could, without further an
thorny, be investigated and those members proceeded against,
accused and pie^ented vO the nation by the report of a com
mi ttee, as culprits unworthy of ho orable association, and
men tin" ma'am expulsion from their seats? In such a case it
is manifest that the House must be immediately notified of the
imphcat on of member^ by a special report, that the House
i self migh take action either m arresting the investigation, or
