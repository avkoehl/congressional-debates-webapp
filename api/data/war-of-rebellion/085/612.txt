Major-General ROSECRANS:

Brigadier General E. C. Pike is coming up on the railroad with his command, about 3,000 infantry. I will order them immediately forward to Gray's Summit. The commissary stores that are coming up will also go forward. Any other troops coming up by rail to join me? I will order Merrill forward in the morning, if you approve. Please answer quick.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

Major-General SMITH:

How are the roads from Franklin to the Summit? Your supplies will come out to-night. How are you, and what news have you?

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 4, 1864-7.40 p. m.

General A. J. SMITH:

General not here. No re-enforcements for the up-river movement. You know our situation as regards cavalry. Keep Merrill in your rear if you can, as he is our reliance to cover the city. The other cavalry regiments are yours.

J. V. DU BOIS.

FRANKLIN, October 4, 1864-8.25 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The dirt road from here to the Summit is quite good. General Pike has arrived and will disembark here. Can't get the road. Just reported General Ewing arrived safely in Rolla. I believe the report. Cavalry was sent out from Rolla and joined him near Leasburg early Sunday morning. I will telegraph you again soon.

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, MO., October 4, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

My scout, who has just returned from the different of the Gasconade, reports about 500 of the enemy at Little Washington. Two brigades, with four pieces of artillery, are following up the Missouri River. Price's main forces have taken the main road to Jefferson City and will reach the Gasconade to-night. He reports Price's combined forces about 20,000, including conscripts not armed. Colonel Catherwood, with the Thirteenth Missouri and Seventh Kansas, is at Union, with orders to push forward and make a reconnaissance toward the Gasconade. I hope to hear from them in the morning. I will advance as rapidly as possible with my small force, numbering about 8,000 men and four batteries of artillery. I hope I may be permitted to order Merrill forward by leaving some three companies of militia at this point. Please answer.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
