HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTHERN ALABAMA,Huntsville, October 23, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded for information of the general commanding. Was not in before the completion of my report. "Below Pulaski" in telegram from me is a mistake; information sent was that the enemy had struck the road "below Athens," and was telegraphed before the return of Colonel Prosser, 6 a. m. on 24th. It was from Colonel Prosser at Athens, 2 a. m., that General Starkweather got his information. Main body of Forrest's command arrived about that time and surrounded Colonel P. in the town.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTHERN ALABAMA,Huntsville, October 23, 1864.

It is now believed that the force that first appeared at the plantation of Jack Harris was part of Roddey's command, under Colonel Warren, who states he opposed our forces with his brigade below Athens.
