meat to subsist the troops well until beef-cattle can be furnished. There have been received at Vicksburg since this report was made up 600,000 rations of rice and other stores that were in transit on the Mobile and Ohio and Mississippi Central Railroads. Many of the stores that were on these roads are not reported at all, for the reason that they were shipped before the 1st instant, and not received prior to that date at Vicksburg. It will be seen by reference to the report that there is a larger accumulation of stores at Port Hudson than elsewhere; a portion of them has been ordered to Vicksburg. There is a boat recently out of Redd River, now in Big Black, with 180,000 rations of bacon, 530 hogs, and 3,000 pounds of lard for Vicksburg. The railroads being now in running condition, large quantities of stores will be sent to Vicksburg from points on these roads. Besides the boat now in Big Black, the steamer Hine, with a load of commissary stores out of Red River, is now at Port Hudson.
