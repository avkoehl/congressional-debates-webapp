Question. What do you consider was the force of the enemy in Corinth at the attack was made?

Answer. I should think there were about 15,000 men. It is only a conjecture on my part.

Question. How far to the left of Corinth did the enemy's line of battle extend?

Answer. I had no means of ascertaining and do not know.

Question. Do you know whether or not the force you saw the next morning in the entrenchments was there at this time?

Answer. I am not positive ; it is only surmise that they we were not.

Question. Did you suppose that with a force of 15,000 men the enemy's center would consist of only five regiments?

Answer. I did not see the whole of the enemy's center. In speaking of five regiments I alluded to those immediately in front of my own brigade.

Question. Do you know whether the sketch in possession of General Lovell was intended to represent anything more than the locality of the works and not the number of guns? Where is that sketch?

Answer. The sketch in possession of General Lovell was a very rough one and very much defaced, and only intended to show the supposed location of the works. I do not know where it is. It remained in his possession.

Question. The first specification of the first charge states that the enemy was strongly fortified and in formidable numbers, fully prepared for a stubborn resistance, and that the attack was made without due consideration or forethought. As you state, Corinth might have been taken in the evening of the 3d. Did you at this time change your opinion?

Answer. I have not changed my opinion. It appeared to me that provision should have been made, and a distant understanding in case our impetuous attack on the advance works was successful, in what number it was to be followed up.

Question. Do you know that no such orders were given by General Van Dorn?

Answer. I do not, but am satisfied that the mode in which the attack was followed up was not the result of proper reflection.

Question. Do you mean here to say the mode of the attack was followed up in the division or brigade to which you belonged or to the whole army?

Answer. In the division to which I belonged. General Lovell appeared to me to be very undecided, and seemed to be waiting orders.

(Court cleared by request of General Maury, and determined to confine the question and testimony more closely to the subject.)

Question. Was your brigade put on duty as rear guard by order of General Lovell or Van Dorn, and who kept them there forty-three hours?

Answer. They were first put on duty with Lovell's whole division and subsequently detached by General Lovell. He refused three times to relieve me, and I subsequently appealed to General Van Dorn, who then relieved me.

Question. Did General Van Dorn go from Ripley to Hickory Flat on the road taken by your division or on that taken by General Price?

Answer. On the road taken by General Price.

Question. Did you hear anything of orders having been given by me for your division to encamp between Orizaba and Hickory Flat?
