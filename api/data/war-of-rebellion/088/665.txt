Captain H. C. WEIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division, Cavalry Corps:

I have the honor to report that I drove in the enemy's pickets on the railroad to within 400 yards of the junction of it with the Dinwiddie Court-House road, at which point the enemy appeared in force of about fifty, firing on my men, and on the Vaughan road I drove them across the swamp. Both these roads they had barricaded by trees and wires. Across the swamp they had a camp of cavalry, probably a reserve of their pickets.
