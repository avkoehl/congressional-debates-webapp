FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864-1 a. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

The operator at Lawrence promised to go out and see what was going on and come back to report unless he was prevented. About ten minutes after he told me that the circuit on the line changed. I have not been able to get anything from him, and the line I think is on the ground. It worked well up to about ten minutes after he told me what I sent you before.

THORP,

Night Operator.
