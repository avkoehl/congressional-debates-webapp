eral Garrard will operate upon the enemy's right. You will please move close to Sandtown early to-morrow with your command, aid General Kilpatrick in crossing the river, and report to him for duty during the expedition. Until General Kilpatrick gets across the river, try to scout all the roads from the river to the right of our infantry. General Kilpatrick will have instructions from General Sherman for further operations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 14, 1864-11 a.m.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires you to push out your skirmish line so far as to cover the Campbellton road for half a mile to the right of your present position.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 14, 1864.

General McARTHUR:

General Garrard will scout with his cavalry up Chattahoochee as far as Roswell and McAfee's. If small parties of cavalry approach Marietta, you should ambuscade them with infantry. It has a better effect than to run them down by cavalry.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 14, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel R. R. TOWNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to report nothing unusual in my front to-day. The usual amount of picket-firing was kept up, with some artillery, doing but little damage, as shown by the list of casualties. On last night I straightened and intrenched the skirmish line on my right, upon the ground gained by the advance of yesterday, which, to a certain extent, relieved that portion of my line from exposure to the enemy's sharpshooters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
