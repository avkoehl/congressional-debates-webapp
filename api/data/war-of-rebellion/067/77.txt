musketry. Immediately after the beginning of the attack upon Warren, Hancock moved forward. The rebels were intrenched, and in considerable force between the creek he had crossed and the river, and made a pertinacious resistance to his onset, but before dark he had forced them from their works and driven them across the stream. Taylor's Bridge is in his possession. General Grant has ordered him to cross his corps and intrench himself on the south shore, if possible, calling upon Burnside for any re-enforcements of which he may stand in need. Wright is also ordered over to the support of Hancock, so that if Lee should attack in the morning he may be suitably received. It appears that the rebel general was misled by Hancock's march to Bowling Green and to Milford, and had massed his forces lower down to resist our crossing over the Pamunkey, having his center at Hanover Junction. Prisoners report that his whole three corps are present, besides the forces under Hoke. Longstreet's corps has been completed by the restoration of Pickett's division.

10.30 p.m.-From a dispatch just received from Warren, as well as from officers of Grant and Meade, the destructive repulse of the enemy is confirmed. They assailed Warren's right with such violence that the brigade formerly commanded by Sol. Meredith, in Cutler's (late Wadsworth's) division, broke in confusion, but the evil was soon remedied. The slaughter of the enemy was very great; our losses inconsiderable. The rebels charged against our artillery, and suffered, especially from canister. Warren now reports that it was Hill's not Longstreet's, corps, which attacked him. Among the prisoners we have taken to-day is an officer who reports that he left Savannah with a body of troops five days ago.

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 24, 1864. (Received 7 a.m., 25th.)

The enemy have fallen back, whether to take up a position beyond the South Anna or to go to Richmond is uncertain. Reports brought by negroes favor the latter alternative. Warren, Burnside, and Hancock are pushing forward after the retreating army. Warren captured a good number of prisoners last evening, but has not yet had time to count them, nor to ascertain his losses. Hancock, in storming the rifle-pits this side of the river last evening, also took between 100 and 200 prisoners, and drove many rebels into the river, where they were drowned. Warren captured some official papers, amongst them an order calling out all boys of seventeen to garrison Richmond. Ambulance-men and musicians are also ordered to the ranks. Sheridan heard from this morning at Dunkirk; will be at Milford to-night. The country just here in densely wooded with pine, much like the Wilderness region. Roads very sandy.
