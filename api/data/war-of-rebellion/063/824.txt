HEADQUARTERS MARMADUKE'S BRIGADE,May 13, 1864.

Major H. EWING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: The brigade is now encamped on Bayou Bartholomew at crossing of Monticello and Gaines' Landing road. There are 15,000 or more bushels of corn accessible to our trains in the neighborhood, the farthest lot being 3 miles distant. The water is the only objection to this camp, but it will do pretty well as long as the weather remains cool. Nothing has been heard from the enemy. No report from the scout above Monticelo. A scout has been ordered to Gaines' Landing. A citizen named Wilson, formerly of Bolivar county, Miss., has four wagons, with 19 bales of cotton, which he desires to sell to the enemy for supplies. He has a permit to sell from Captain Reg. H. thompson, commanding battalion, who professes to be acting under orders from district headquarters. I have stopped the wagons and will not allow him to proceed unless you so order. Do you know anything of Captain Thompson? It is rumored that he is a guerrilla and entirely irresponsible. A steam mill is convenient to camp, and it is thought an abundance of good beef can be procured.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. JEFFERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
