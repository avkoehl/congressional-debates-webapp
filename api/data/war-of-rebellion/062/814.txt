of his family, employes, or slaves. If the officer and party differ as to the quantity necessary, the question to be settled by two loyal and disinterested citizens, one to be selected by each. (See section 7 of the law.)

2. That no officer shall, at any time, unless especially ordered so to do by a general commanding, in a case of exigency, impress supplies which are on their way to market for sale on arrival.

We have agreed to the foregoing, after mature deliberation. We are indebted to Government agents for much information. It will be seen by them that we have in nearly every instance adopted their suggestions as to prices for subsistence. In a few we have not, because in some places prices were higher than in others, without the cost of production being greater. If our scales have hitherto been too low, surely none can complain of our present rates, unless they are determined to throw obstructions in the way of the Government. We consent to these advanced rates with reluctance. And why? Because we know that the Government intends to redeem with gold or its equivalent every dollar of its currency, and what justice is there in giving outrageous prices in currency for subsistence, and afterward redeeming that currency dollar for dollar? As Governor Murrah has forcibly asked, "If this currency is to be redeemed, why should the people be thus misled to their own detriment, and led into practices which will fix upon their own shoulders and upon their posterity a load of debt ten times greater than it should be?"

Our soldiers will have to be taxed for the payment of this debt thus enlarged by enormous prices. They have already sacrificed largely of their property; many have lost all in our struggle, and get but a pittance for their labor. The Government never can pay them what their valor merits. The people at home must mainly support our armies; they are only called upon to dispose of their surplus; and will they, by refusing to sell at a fair remuneration, in the hope of amassing fortunes, impose upon the soldier a burden of taxation under which he must be bowed down long after the smoke of battle shall have cleared away?
