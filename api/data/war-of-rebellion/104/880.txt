Brigadier General A. ASBOTH,

Commanding District of West Florida:

SIR: Your communication of yesterday's date has been received. The major-general commanding directs me to transmit for your information and guidance copy of circular letter issued by him on the 20th instant. To private meetings, having for their avowed real object the return of the rebellions States to the Union, he has no objection. The great purpose is to prevent any meetings or movements which in any way recognize the authority of the rebel general or State government, or the officers appointed by those governments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Mr. THOMAS W. CONWAY,

General Superintendent of Freedmen:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs that you proceed to Montgomery, Ala., and such other interior points as you may find it necessary or expedient to visit, for the purpose of giving your personal supervision to the arrangements that may be adopted for the care and support of freedmen within the limits of this command and not already provided for in the Departments of the Gulf and of the Mississippi. The provisions of General Orders, No. 13, from these headquarters, and No. 23, from the Department of the Gulf, and of the inclosed memorandum* will govern, so far as they may be found applicate to the circumstances of locality and the present condition of the planters and the colored people. The major-general commanding does not consider it necessary to give you detailed instructions, which might possibly embarrass your action, and he relies implicitly upon your knowledge of the subject and your judgment to make the best arrangements that can now be made.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
