consultation with General Buford I have concluded to withdraw to- night to the south of Yockeney, leaving scouts behind. General Forrest has had two days' and nights' start for his expedition.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

MERIDIAN, August 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS, Oxford:

Don't yield ground to enemy unnecessarily until he forces you. When he finds Forrest in his rear he will not be apt to advance, and the weather is unfavorable to him. Call on commander at Grenada for report of forces; send them around to Mobile and Ohio Railroad when necessary by enemy's moving to that road.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.

OXFORD, MISS., August 20, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General MAURY, Meridian:

Your order has been received. I will hold on as long as possible, though I think it would be best to go at once where we could rest and fit up the command.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

OXFORD, MISS., August 20, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General FORREST, Senatobia:

Enemy moved to Hurricane Creek yesterday and encamped. Five regiments reported this side of the creek. Skirmishing yesterday evening and this morning at Isham's house. No evidence of general advance this morning.

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

SENATOBIA, August 20, 1864.

General CHALMERS, Oxford:

Have fixed a pontoon and am crossing Hickahale. Expect to have to go to Quinn's Mills to cross Coldwater. Hold the enemy hard and press them up so as to engage their whole attention.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
