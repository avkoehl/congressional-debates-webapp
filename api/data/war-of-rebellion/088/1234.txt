gether as possible, your pickets on the alert, and your scouts out and watchful. As soon as you hear of his being in motion take after him without further orders with all the force that can be withdrawn from the lines, and, if possible, destroy him. You must keep on hand three days' rations and forage so as to start without delay. I have thought it might be advantageous to assign the dismounts or a portion of them with their proper brigades. Why could they not do picket duty on some portion of the line?-at Poplar Spring Church, for instance, where you think infantry might be of service; they might save the horses. At all events, they must be properly officered, instructed, and disciplined. You have to fight so much on foot that they would, if advantageously organized, add greatly to your strength.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant
