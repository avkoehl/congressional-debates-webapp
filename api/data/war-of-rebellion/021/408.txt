No. 3. Reports of Col. John L. Logan, Eleventh Arkansas Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS OLIVE BRANCH,May 11, 1863-10 a. m.

GENERAL: I inclose dispatch from Captain Ramsey, commanding pickets on the Amite and Comite Rivers, stating that Yankees had crossed some force over the Amite. I have ordered some additional force to Captain Ramsey, and directed him to scout the country and watch the movements of the enemy. If the enemy have crossed and go in the direction of Ponchatoula he might very easily be cut off, and I should like to do it. Nothing from Plank or Bayou Sara roads this morning. Shall keep you well advised of any movement of the enemy. Colonel Miles has just arrived.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. L. LOGAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

PICKET RESERVE ON COMITE AND AMITE,

May 10, 1863-11 p. m.

Colonel LOGAN:

DEAR SIR: Information has been received from reliable citizens that about 500 Federal cavalry crossed the Amite on yesterday at Montgomery's and burned his premises and camped last night at Mr. Womack's, in that vicinity, and still remain on the east side of the river. Numerous rumors; unreliable.

S. D. RAMSEY,

Captain, Commanding Pickets.

P. S.- My scouts report that a party of Yankees were across the Amite, gathering cotton and stock. My force is too weak to have out a sufficient scout. All quiet on the Comite.
