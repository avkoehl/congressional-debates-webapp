MAJOR: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you furnish transportation at once for 8,000 men to Tullahoma, Tenn. All cars needed must be supplied without delay. The movement must be made promptly, as the enemy is evidently re-enforcing Rosecrans from the army here.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF MISS. AND EASTERN LOUISIANA,Jackson, April 13, 1863.

Major THEO. Johnston, Chief of Subsistence, Jackson, MISS.:

MAJOR: In reply to the inquiries of Captain Shaaff, assistant commissary of subsistence, referred by you to these headquarters, I am desired to provide ten days' rations for 8,000 men, exclusive of rations being issued to troops now here. The object of this supply is to furnish rations for the troops en route from this point to Tullahoma, Tenn.

If the whole supply is not accumulated at this point, supplies must without fail be provided at points along the route.

The shortness of the supply at this point now felt proves the necessity of its being increased, in order that such emergencies as the present can be met without inconvenience. You are desired to communicate your action in this matter.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, April 13, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma:

Cars cannot run above Okolona. I am now establishing depots of corn at Enterprise and Meridian. Shall also at Macon and Columbus. Meat can only be obtained in moderate quantities for want of wagon transportation. Will do all I can. Have no knowledge of my agents purchasing in Alabama, but, if there, have ordered recall.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,
