GENERAL: Lieutenant-Colonel Boggesss, who is on picket duty near the church, reports infantry advancing in his front. Only their line of skirmishers are yet in sight. I have a prisoner who belongs to Logan's corps. He says that three corps marched from their left last night, and are now flanking around to strike the railroad this side of Atlanta. I have sent Colonel Jones with Ninth Texas to re-enforce Colonel Boggess.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,
