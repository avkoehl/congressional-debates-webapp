HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 28, 1864.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I hope with the facilities that have been furnished the Danville Railroad Company that the road will soon be put in running order again. I beg that you will exert your influence with the officers to stimulate them to the utmost exertion, not only to repair the track, but to increase its capacity as much as possible, and that you will extend to them all the material aid in your power. When the repairs shall have been completed it is of great importance that the fact should not be known to the enemy, and I trust that you will prevail upon the news-papers publisher to abstain from any reference to it, even by implication. If they announce that the road is again open it will only invite another expedition of the enemy against it. I respectfully suggest that you extend this warning so as to embrace all the roads that have been damaged, and are now being repaired. Great injury may result from imprudent publications on this subject.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond:

SIR: The enemy has been engaged to-day apparently in strengthening his lines in front of Petersburg, advancing them at some points. His cavalry, after being repulsed at Staunton River bridge on the afternoon of the 25th, retired in the direction of Christianville, where they encamped that night. The next morning they continued their march toward Lawrenceville by way of Brentsville, and a part of them encamped last night about eight miles northwest of the former place. They appear to be making their way back to the main body of the army.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: This road will be opened to within four miles of Staunton on Thursday. Permit me to urge upon you the importance of protecting us at hanover Court-House. That is really the only point east of Gordonsville where a small raiding party can injure us materially by destroying the trestles and the bridge over south Anna, four miles beyond. Our road is not so important as it has been, but we hope to bring to the city a considerable amount of wheat and other supplies. we have now repaired about nine miles of burned track, besides the bridges. We cannot hope, with the materials we have on hand or
