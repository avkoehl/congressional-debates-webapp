Seward telegraphs that his courier parties were attacked last night twice by Mosby's command, between Bunker Hill and Winchester, and dispersed. Says Mosby with his entire command is between Winchester and Bunker Hill, with view to capture small parties and attack trains. I have no cavalry force here to operate with. Colonel Edwards has a regiment at Winchester, and will doubtless make an effort to disperse them. I shall send orders to him to do so at once. My pursuing party not heard from.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., October 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The cavalry sent out in pursuit of Mosby's guerrillas who burned the train have returned. Report that they failed to overtake them. They learned that they moved off in the direction of the Shenandoah, and, having several hours' start, succeeded in getting away with their prisoners and plunder.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., October 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A body of rebels about 300 strong crossed Potomac this morning at White's Ferry, in vicinity of mouth of Monocacy. They were struck this evening near Adamstown by Loudoun County Rangers. After a skirmish our force fell back toward Point of Rocks. I have sent Major French, with all the cavalry at Remount Camp, mounted, to-day in pursuit of them. Do not consider it more than a raid, as they were engaged in stealing horses when found.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., October 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The force of the enemy that crossed the Potomac to-day were a portion of Mosby's command, about 250 strong. They crossed at White's Ferry, about five miles below the mouth of the Monocacy. Moved out to Adamstown, at which point they were met by the Loudoun County Rangers, and finally driven back across the river. The loss on our side reported four men; enemy's not known. They burned five canal-boats and stole a few horses. Their purposes were evidently a raid, including an attack on railroad trains.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
