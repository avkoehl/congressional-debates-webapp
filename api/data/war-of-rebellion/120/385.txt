Major WEYMOUTH,

First U. S. Volunteers and provost- Marshal:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report having received into this hospital and dressed the wounds of Paul Thoroughgood, Company C, Fourth North Carolina Cavalry, prisoner of war, said to have been wounded by the guard at about 9. 30 last p. m. The missiles consisted, judging from the character of the wounds, of two balls or slugs. One entered right side at anterior border of axilla, passing obliquely downward and emerging at right side of spinous processes on a plane four inches below that of entrance. Distance between point of entrance and that of exit, eight inches. Cavity of thorax not opened and no bone injured. Second ball grazed and wounded the skin at a distance of there inches. Patient at this time doing well.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. THOMPSON,

Surgeon, U. S. Volunteers, in Charge.
