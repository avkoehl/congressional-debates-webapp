HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

Two trains must at once be sent on Decatur road to take troops to Nashville. The trains must run together. One of them will go to Huntsville and report to General Rousseau and take up all the bridge guards between that place and Athens, and one train take on Twenty-first Ohio as soon as the other train approaches from Huntsville. Both will then proceed up the road and take all the bridge guards and infantry on the line up to Columbia. As soon as these trains have passed Columbia the troops there will march for Nashville. This must be done with greatest secrecy. General Rousseau will accompany trains up and be in command. Answer.

Colonel HARRIS, Battle Creek:

Send the battery at Battle Creek to this place by the Battle Creek and Winchester road under escort of one company of infantry. Send the other nine companies of the same regiment to join McCook, starting instantly. The batteries must reach this place to-morrow. Expedite the shipment of stores from Bridgeport, and be ready to evacuate that point and Battle Creek at moment's notice. Do all this quietly, and when you leave destroy what cannot be taken, and bring all the troops.

BATTLE CREEK, August 23, [1862].

General BUELL:

McCook did not take the road from Jasper to Tracy City; he returned to Jasper and took the Winchester road, intending, as I understand, to march to Tracy City by that route. The Tracy City road is impracticable.
