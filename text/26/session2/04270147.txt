is true we have been deiea ed, but not annihi ated
Let him not suppose that we have given up in de-

submit to Federal rule. No, sir, we are not d s

of a glorious "re urrection" to the Democracy
Alieady the seeds of di union aie sown in your

as weak and harmless as the child in its mother's

pose Now you ait placed m the mjjenly, having
the responsibility of the Government resting upon

THE BANKRUPT BILL
REMARKS OFMR. WRIGHT,
Or I\LW YORK
In Señale, Monday, lebrmry 8, 1841__Tne Bank
mpt o ti being under c >n«idera ion, and the re-
solution of Mr IIiu>bird to recommit the bill to
the Committee on the Judiciary, with instru
tions to so amend it as to include banks and
other trad ng incorporation-, being the question
before tne Sena'e—
Mr WRIOrHl did not rise, as his friend [Mir
Sevib.r] aad observed, to mane a speech, but the
lather, as he was sometimes called upon to do, to
a tempt an explanation of his own course in re-
ference to th  bid then before the Senate Before
he proceeded, he would make another remark, and
that was that ihe op nions of Mr Van Buren,
w hether fave rabie or unfavorable, to the proposi-
tion uncer di cuss on, were only to himthe opinions
o' a fntnd, whom he respecta and admired, but
they had nothing to do here, either on the one side
or the other, and ttie-efore he should not lee! called
upon to read lrom ihcm as authority for his c ursc*.
He made the remark because he had c Served th-it,
to settles hat seemed tobe asott oí controversy
among his intnd , thty huid reference to the opi
mors o! the Piesident, formerly expressed against
lneivding banks and otnermcorporat ns m the pro-
vis ons oí a bankrupt law, and, a' a later period, in
favor of including them, lor he believed he did the
Pr sidentno injustice, wntn he said he had changed
opinion upon this point, and had frankly expressed
tha' change This, howevei, was immaterial to
him He respected the opinions of c thers and es-
pecially those of the President, as much as any
man, and gave them as much weight, pnd still
he endeavored to make up his own mind on all
questions upon which he was compelled to act
He desire I now (he indulgence oí the Senate,
while ne gave a buef hi„tory of the present agitn-
tion of l is great question of a bankrupt 1 <w, which
he v. as compelled to give, t"> jj tify ius own eour e

United States, their piaj er be n„ for the pas age of
a "uniform law on the subject of b^nkruptc es

to a sin le <eaturt which sue i a law, ¡n th i p nion
of the ( titioners, should take
E rly in thoce proceedings, as one of those ma-
nifest! ions of public sentiment which, coming
from such a sourc-, an 1 rel Umg to such a subject,
have evei a strong influence on hi> mind and ac-
tion, was a meetirg of merchants of the city of
Ne v York, at the Exchange m that city, making
an appeal to Congress to pass such a la« He
(Mr Wiucht) chd net fail then to s e that any
bankrup law must affect the solvent merchants
more scimbly than, atij c ther interest in this coun
try, except the solvent banks, and nis heart rcj iced
that ihe olvent merchants believed it was expe
dieut for Congress to exercise that high po ver, and
to pass a bankrupt law, at a crisis such as then exist
ed Tae grant ot the po verm the Constitution is
express and full, but upon one sin„Ie occasion only,
during ihe existence of our Government, has it
been called into exercre, and then for a brief pe
nod, anu with un^atisí. ctory result , trough we
have experienced frequent and severe revulsto is in
trade,j?xtensue aid mischievous derangement, oí
ou curieticy, an 1 ¡>en ds of wide spread and dtp o
r&ble msoiv t cy The unpublished his ory of that
^meeting at the Eu.han?e in the city of New York
told him a farther fac , that Hut meeting respo ic'ed
to the sentim 11 that, ii a bankrupt lav was to be
passed, the bai k ng institatioi s of the count y
should be int laded in its opeiation, though the i
solutions adopted conta red no such expression A
genilpman we'l known to the Senate, aul well
1 no.vn to thi hele country (ne allude ' 'o a late
Attorney Genera1 of the Ur ited States, Mr Berj i-
mnF Butler,) ade rc^s 1 that aid firs  for hiuro
on that point, and hi  sentiments were responded to
with enthusiasm by the members oí the meeting—
a meeting tomprtsms a body of merchanls of the
city of New Yoik—of the bankers—of th • bro-
kers—of the traders—indeed, oí the business men
of all professions and classes, equal in intelligence,
in enterprise, in wealth, in all uhicb constituted
them competent judges oí the p.oper provisions of
a bankrupt law, to any other body oí msn which
could have been assembled m that gieat cit„, or at
any other commercial point in the countiy.
Another material step, for he passed but
lightly ovei the these «ubjects, was that the pro-
ceedings ct that meeting of the merchants aad
oihers of that city v ere, by its older, tr- ns
milted to the Legislature oí the S ate of New York,
with a respectful íequest that *ae Le^islaluie would
si^nifv to the representat vts of the Stale m the two
Hcuesof Congress, its opinion on this importan'
subject The Legislature did pas^ resolutions m
one of its branches, in the precipe language of the
petmens m favor of a bankrupt l?w, which had
passed through his hands, and which he had before
described In the other branch of the Legislature
the form of the resolutions was changed, and they
wera made to express—he spoke from recollection
merely, for he had them not before hi n—a wish
that Congress should exercise its corsntutioiui
powei to pass a uniform l w on ihe subject ot
bankrnpcies of natural ppisons thioughout the
United S at s That amendment was adopted in the
popular branch of the L gislature, but i> remans
to th s day, a quesaon of fact whtdier that aheia-
tonif the !egi lative re olati ns was era con-
