Mr. CLAYTON. 1 present the memorial of
Charles D. Ailroedson, asking compensation for
services as Chaigo d'Affaires ad interim at Stock-
holm. At a former session of Congress one half of
the compensation due to him for such services was
appropriated and was paid to him. Only one half
was allowed, because it was supposed the fees
which he received as Consul at Stockholm would,
together with the sum appropriated, be sufficient
to compensate him. It now appears that the whole -
amount of fees that he received was but eighty-
nine dollars. As those services were performed
during the time that I was in the Department of
State, I think it my duty to add my testimony to
that of my successor in office, and express the
opinion that tins gentleman is entitled to the com-
pensation due to a Charge d'Affaires for the time
during which he served in that capacity. I move
that the memorial be referred to the Committee on
Foreign Relations.
The motion was agreed to.

RIVER AND HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS.
Mr. BELL. I rise to make an inquiry of the
chairman of the Committee on Commerce. That
committee for several sessions past have thought
it expedient to make no report on the numerous
memorials and resolutions referred to them in ref-
erence to the improvement of rivers and harbors,
upon the ground, as it has been supposed, that
they thought it the better plan for tne Senate to
await the proceedings of the House upon that sub-
ject, and to take up a bill for that purpose when
it should be sent here by the House. The con-
sequence has been, that the river and harbor bill
has never made its appearance here until a very
late period of the session; and when that happens
to be the long session of Congress, the summer is
usually more than half spent before the appropria-
tions for these great objects are made, and con-
sequently, during the year of the long session, theie
can be no expenditure, and no continuation of the
works in progress. For this reason these works
become in some degree dilapidated before the of-
ficers of the Government can proceed in the execu-
tion of their duty . This habit has been so inces-
sant now, that it has become a very plausible
argument against the whole system; and it is con-
tended that it is pursued in such an irregular man-
ner as not to be worth much. The works are
suspended every two years, although the appro-
priations may be made by Congress every other
year; and this has been a fruitful cause for com-
plaint.
The inquiry which I wish to make of the hon-
orable chairman is, whether it is the intention of
â  that committee to pursue the same course at the
! present session ? If so, m my opinion it is tanta-
I mount to making no appropriation whatever. But,
sir, I cannot disguise it from myself and from the
Senate that it may be possible that the action of
the Senate's committee, or of the Seriate, upon the
subject, will be no remedy for the evils of which I
complain; but if we proceed actively to report a
bill in reasonable time, and send it to the House,
we shall have discharged our duty, and the re-
sponsibility for the passage of that bill at some
day, which will permit these works to proceed, will
not rest upon us but upon the House of Repre-
sentatives. If we pursue this course, and the
House shall pass the bill in reasonable time, the
results which have been so much complained of
will be obviated. If an opposite course be pur-
sued, the million and a half of dollars spent last
year will haye been partially lost for the want of
a consecutive application of the funds to the reg-
ular progress of the works.
Mr. HAMLIN. Mr. President, I think it has
been the uniform practiceof the Senate, or at least
of the Senate Committee on Commerce, to await
a .bill from the House to make appropriations for
the improvement of harbors, rivers, and lakes.
I am not aware that that piactice has ever been
departed from. If it has been, the case is not
within my knowledge, nor am I aware that the
Committee on Commerce propose to depart from
the ordinary course at the present time. I sup-
pose it is within the province of the Senate com-
!i mittee to report an appropriation bill, without
!' awaiting* for one from the House. I suppose it is
II equally within the province of the Committee on
