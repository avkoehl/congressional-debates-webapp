and take possession of the Summertown road, which he is informed will require him to descend into the valley. He has captured two guns, and he thinks full 2,000 prisoners. Our loss is not severe, he says.

Carlin's brigade crossed over Chattanooga Creek from here to Lookout late this afternoon to Hooker's support. It has had considerable fighting.

The enemy's wagon trains were seen passing between 2 and 3 p.m. down the Summertown road from the top of the mountain to Chattanooga Valley.

By order Major-General Grant:

JNumbers A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Chattanooga, Tennessee, November 24, 1863.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: General Sherman carried Missionary Ridge as far as the tunnel, with only slight skirmishing. His right now rests at the tunnel and on top of the hill; his left at Chickamauga Creek.

I have instructed General Sherman to advance as soon as it is light in the morning, and your attack, which will be simultaneous, will be in co-operation.

Your command will either carry the rifle-pits and ridge directly in front of them or move to the left, as the presence of the enemy may require. If Hooker's present position on the mountain can be maintained with a small force, and it is found impracticable to carry the top from where he is, it would be advisable for him to move up the valley with all the force he can spare and ascend by the first practicable road.

Very respectfully,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.
