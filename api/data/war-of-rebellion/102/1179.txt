Indian expeditions and curtail them. They have been planned under General Pope's direction, and I am not posted as to the necessity of them. I will go to Saint Louis in a few days and look into this matter myself. In the meantime I think all extraordinary requisitions should be disapproved. I will not go back to Washington for some weeks.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, August 12, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

I get off to-day and will straighten matters on plains. It seems to me all the rascals in the West are combined to swindle Government. My staff officers at Fort Leavenworth report great amount of swindling there and in Kansas. It is done by stealing Government stock and in every conceivable way. I have picked up over 100 stolen horses and mules here, and there appears to be a fearful organization extending clear to Denver and to Missouri. They entice men to desert, sell the Government property, and then assist them in getting out of the country. Is General Elliott going to Kansas? A wide-awake officer should be in command there, and ought to be on the ground soon. Do I understand Your dispatch to mean that no requisitions are to be filled on my approval?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, August 12, 1865.

Major TICHENOR,

Aide-de-Camp:

Put the Fiftieth Wisconsin Infantry on boat and send it to Fort Rice. They should be got off immediately and the regiment ought to be over 600 for duty. Send every officer belonging to it, leaving the Forty-eighth Wisconsin at Fort Leavenworth to replace the Fiftieth, but don't let Fiftieth wait of that regiment to arrive as we have to get them up there by October 1. Of boat should not be able to get up let them take them as far as possible, and regiment to march rest of distance. They want to take rations to get them through. Answer.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA, August [12], 1865.

Captain GEORGE F. PRICE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Laramie:

Send no troops to Utah until I get up there. War Department has stopped the brigade of infantry en route, and I shall have to get another regiment of infantry from Fort Riley. I leave here Saturday night for Kearny.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
