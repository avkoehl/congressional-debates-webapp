Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy seem to be concentrating a force of Port Royal, whether for offense or defense, I cannot yet tell. Troops reported coming south from North Carolina may be intended to operate from that base. If so, railroad communication with Savannah will soon be interrupted, for my forces are too small to protect it.

*If it is desirable to rifle the two 32-pounders in the rear of Secessionville, they can be replaced by lighter gun on siege-carriages. These guns are now mounted on casemates carriages, which are unsuitable for the location, and should be replaced by siege of barbette carriages.
