HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 1, 1864.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding Third Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that the direction and termination of the left of the picket-line of the Third Corps should be governed by the right of that of the Second Corps. The general position of the picket-line of the Second Corps would be modified by the manner in which the brigade of the Second Corps in front of Stevensburg was posted. A communication upon this subject has just been made to the commander of the Second Corps, who will advance the right of his picket-line so as to throw it in front of the cavalry and infantry brigade and on the road from Stevensburg to Raccoon Ford. The left of the picket-line of the Third Corps should be advanced accordingly and unite with that of the Second Corps at such point near the raccoon Ford road as may be found most suitable.
