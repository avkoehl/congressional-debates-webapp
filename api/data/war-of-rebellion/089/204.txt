HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 13, 1864-5 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

W. H. Kent was excluded from the army by order of Lieutenant General Grant on the complaint of Major-General Hancock. Recently an application to return from Mr. Kent was referred to me by General Grant and after referring to Major-General Hancock, was returned to General Grant with General Hancock's indorsement and mine. I have personally no objection to Mr. Kent or any other person being here who will confine himself to facts and the truth.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

There has been no change in my lines since last report. The deserter who reported the mining operations of the enemy fixed the place as Battery 21. A well and galleries are now being constructed. Deserters came in this morning from Ransom's, Gracie's, and Thomas' brigades. The latter is over the river.

General MEADE:

There has been nothing more discovered than was to you yesterday morning. The deserter fixed the direction of the gallery under Battery 21, but his statement was not considered sufficient to remove the garrison. Evidently the enemy have a countermine under the fort opposite, and the only gallery they are running is the listening gallery. Its reported length, however, which was 150 yards three weeks ago, according to the deserter, and has been worked on since, led to the thought that they might propose mining. The distance is 540 yards. Lieutenant Benyaurd, who was out with the man, can give you full information. The wells in front of Fort Sedgwick are nearly full of water, showing that none of them have been tapped. An officer entered one the other night, but heard no signs of work. Unless there is something more developed you may not consider it worth while to move the garrison.
