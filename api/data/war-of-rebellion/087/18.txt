CITY POINT, VA., August 16, 1864.

(Received 8 p. m. 18th.)

The fighting north of the river to-day has resulted favorably for us so far as it has gone, but there have been no decisive results. The enemy have been driven back somewhat from their position of this morning, with a considerable loss in killed and wounded and about 400 prisoners left in our hands. Two brigadier-generals (Chambliss and Girardey) were killed, and their bodies left in our hands. We also have quite a number of wounded prisoners. I have relieved the Fifth Corps from the trenches, and have it ready to march around Petersburg if the enemy can be induced to throw troops enough north of the James to justify it. Since moving north of the river, our losses will probably reach near 1,000 in killed and wounded, very many, however, only slightly wounded, owing to so much of the fighting taking place in thick woods. The enemy have lost about as many that have fallen into our hands.

General Warren moved with his corps this morning to and across the Weldon road about one mile worth of the lead-works. To that point he met nothing but the enemy's pickets. he advanced from there toward Petersburg, meeting the enemy early in his advance. He had considerable fighting during the day, suffering some loss and inflicting loss upon the enemy. I have no report showing the extent of our losses, but judge them to be light, from the dispatches. Some of the enemy's wounded fell into our hands and a few into our hands and a few other prisoners.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864-11 a. m.

Taking possession of the Weldon road has made the enemy apparently very nervous. They have been constantly attacking to regain possession. I cannot report accurately the result, but apparently our losses have been light in killed and wounded, whilst the enemy's loss in that respect must have been heavy, from the fact of his being repulsed so often. The second day, however, we lost heavily in captured, from the fact that the enemy enveloped Warren's right before he was aware of it. I withdrew the troops from north of the James River last night, and now the Second Corps must be nearly in supporting distance of Warren.
