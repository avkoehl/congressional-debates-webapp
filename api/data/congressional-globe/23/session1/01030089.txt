placed, until drawn fiom, by apptopna-

The Secienry says that the charter de-
volves upon th° Executive the exclusive
power ol removing the deposites     Mi   B
submitted tint the power was given not to
the Executive, noi to an íirt-ut of the Ex-
ecut.ve,   but  to  the  ag( nt  of Confess
He then passed to the considerition of
arruínente drawn fiom the acts urgTii7'ng
and regulating the D"pattuients     The nist
act was passed in 17bS     Tin-, leganl   the
Department ofroici th Affurs  It pi ov ides
that the head of tl isD^pntmei t oh II pti-
form and  execute such duties as sh ill be
devolved upon him, iiom time to tint   by
the Pie^ident, and -hal' conduct the bu-i-
ne^ .nsuch manner as tho Picsident sh  II,
from time to tun"  piesc ibe    The next act
established the Wai Depaitment, and pio-
vides that the Secretary of W ir should ex-
ecute such duties as the President, in pur-
suinceof the Constitution, should devolve j
upon him     When thc\ came to est iblisli !
the Depiitmentof the Navy, they d.d it m |
the same «oids.    Butwnc'i thry tamo to
establish trie Depaitmcit of the Tit isurv,
we see that they cl anged the title of tin
act and  its  whole language, it  uas, as
fiist repoited  by the  committee, entitled
an act to establish an  Executive Depirt-
ment, &.C., but the title was subsequently
changed     This act makes it the du*y of
the Seaetary of the Tie-s'i.y to piopose
plans to be submitted to Congiess for lad-
ing and collecting the revenue, to pie-
senbe the foim of keeping accounts, and to ,
execute  such duties ab by law might be
ltquired of him.    All the th.ee other De- [
partments are  preside ntnl Departments,
belonging to thcoflice of Piesidcnl    Now,
the rreas.ni y Depaitment was not a deput-
ment of the executive blanch of the Gov-
ernment  in   name  or  design      To  have
placed the public money in an executive
department, under the control of the Pres-
ident   would have been a solecism m  the
Constitution. The money was to be di twn
from the Tieasurv by waiiant alone    Such
a thiiKT as making the Tieasmvan execu-
tive  deputmcrit,   and   at the same time,
o-ivmo- Congies, the sole powci of appl-
anations would have been a solecism md
constitutional   absuid.ty. 'His   po.-t.on,
therefore, was, that nothing ispla ed in the hands
of the Executive but what tie Cons uution has
pui there

The powers ot 'he Pi s d nt are to appoint d iec
ois on tne part i" the Gov ernment, with the advice
and consent of the Senate, ¡>nd to direct the issue
of a  enejarías to asv-eitam whether the bank had
vio'ated its charter The powers of the Secretary
were to direct tra isreis of the public funds, and
to withhold fiom the bark 'lie pubhe deposites
I repeat, said Mi B , that the entire and exclu-
sive control of the paJic deposites is ¡nheient in
Congiess, exee[ t so lir ab it is given to the bank.
Here he d d notcc nfound power with right Con-
gress, ne contended, had absolute right over the
deposites to the whole ex ent to which they had
not parted wuh it to the bank Congress is the
tieaburer of the people It represents the people
m rai mg levenue, in guarding it, and in oppro-
pi in ins it t > the public sei vice It gives certain
ut! ts to the bank, suoject to a covenant If the
bank violued the covenant, theie was an equiva-
lent discharg  trom obligation on the other sice.
It the bank violated the agieement, ihe right re-
vel ts to Congress to dispose of the deposites as it
pleases Now, gentlemen might malte the rights
of the bank as broad or as nairowasthey please;
as soon as one paito'the agreement was violated
Congress c mid lesume the whole power     The
0  ject of Congress was to pr vide for the sa'ety
of the deposites The instant the bank ceases to
peifoim herduty, tlntms ant Congress might act
Heie, in tne charter, the power is given to the
Se-retary of the Ireasury to act when it was fhi-
possible that Congress could act—'hat is, when
Congiess was not in session The dangerous
consequences of the doctrine contended for must
strike every one it snipped Congiess of all
powei over the pubhc money Shall we stain the
memoiy of the Congress of 18IG bysupoosingthat
they i itended to give away this money to the
bink a id the Secietaiy of the Trrasuiy,to enable
them to hold it and contiol it as long as they mu-
tually conn ved at eicn othei's conduct, while
Congiess s ood b> with tneu 1 anils ued '—for the
doctrine comes to tais D d the Congiess of 1816
intend to act in.th.is mannei No, sir They made
a i lain, obvious and Useful piovision, giving the
Secietaiy the po ver to witn lolcl the deposites
fi mi the bank in a cer am case, because, fiom his
situation, he would necessarily beapprised of any
fpiroaclmig dangei to the pubhc money This
net wis in hciilvand almost expressly subjeo'ed
t y the terms of the charter to the revision of Con-
gress
So much ror the proposition that Congress can-
