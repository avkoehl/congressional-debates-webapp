HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Turner and Mason's Ferry Road, July 23, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Lieutenant D. F. HOW:

My command drove the rebels away from here this morning. The force in my front was Jackson's division. I got the report of effective force of one brigade, Harrison's, and it numbered 1, 618 men. So I judge the division is strong, which is confirmed by prisoners taken. I will open communication with General Davis as soon as possible. It is about a mile from here to the river. I sent the dispatch to General Stoneman across.

Very respectfully,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: I have examined our line of circumvallation, and have no fear of the enemy even attempting to test its strength. But until we get our cavalry in hand and position, I will not attempt anything serious. You may therefore keep things statu quo, and look only to your supplies of food and ammunition. I have seen General Rousseau, and am satisfied he has made a break that cuts off Alabama for a month, and he has brought us in pretty fair condition some 2,500 additional cavalry.

I am, yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Before Atlanta, July 23, 1864.

Colonel CAMERON, Commanding Second Brigade:

SIR: You will occupy the lines on the left of Colonel Barter's brigade, which General Woods will leave, putting in your whole command in one line, if necessary, to fill them. Then let working parties strengthen and thicken the parapet from the outside, and put in chevaux-de-frise and such abatis, &amp;c., as you can, putting the works in the best condition and holding them at all hazards. I expect to have at least one brigade in reserve ready to support either or Barter, though I have not yet got it relieved. I will see you in an hour, or two at furthest, after seeing General Schofield, getting some breakfast, and changing my horse.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
