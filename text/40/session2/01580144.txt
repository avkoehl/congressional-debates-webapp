SUPPLEMENT TO
before I went over to the President's or after.
I think it was before, however.
Question. You told Mr. Wilkeson, he tells
tis, that you meant to call ou General Grant
for a military force to take possession of the
office ?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Did you mean that when you told
it, or was it merely rhodomontade?
Answer. I suppose I did not mean it, for it
never entered my head to use force.
Question. You did not mean it?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. It was mere boast, brag ?
Answer. Oh, yes.
Question. How was that? Speak as loud as
you did when you began.
Answer. 1 suppose so.
Question. Very well, then. You saw Wil-
keson that evening again, did you not, at Wil-
lard's Hotel?
Answer. I think I saw him there for a few
moments.
Question. Did you again tell him you meant
to use force to get into the office ?
Answer. That I do not recollect. I stated
it to him once I know.
Question. Can you not tell whether you
bragged to him again that evening?
Answer. I did not brag to him.
Question. Did you not tell him at Willard's
that you meant to use force to get into that
office ?
Answer. Either at my office or Willard's,
one of the two.
Question. You have already said you told it
to him at your office?
Answer. I do not think I told it to him more
than once.
Question. Suppose that ho testifies that you
told it at Willard's to him ; was that brag
then?
Answer. It would have been the same—yes.
Question. You saw Burleigh that evening?
Answer. At my own house.
Question. Did you tell him that you meant
to use force?
Answer. I think the expression I used to
him was that if I found my doors locked 1 would
break tlicra open.
Question. Did he not put the question to you
in this form substantially: What will you do
if Si an to II will not go out;" and did you not
answer, " We will put him out?"
Answer. I dare say 1 did.
Question. Do you not know you did?
Answer. I dare say 1 did; I am not certain.
Question. Did he notthen say, " Butsuppose
the doors are barred;" and did you notthen
say,f will batter them down," or " We will
batter them down?"
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Was that brag?
Ansicer. No, sir. At that time I fell as if
I would open the doors if they were locked
against me.
Question. Then you had got over bragging
at that time, had you?
Answer. I suppose so.
Question. Do you not know whether you had
or not?
Answer. When I had this conversation with
Mr. Burleigh I felt precisely as I said to him.
Question. At that time you really meant to
go in and break down the door?
Answer. If it was locked, yes.
Question. And really meant to use force ac-
cording as you said you would? You meant,
what you said, did you not?
Answer. I meant what I said.
Question. I)o you mean to say that Mr.
Burleigh has not properly put before the Sen-
ate what you did say ?
Answer. I do not pretend to say so. He
would recollect the conversation better than I.
Question. And whatever you said .to him you
meant in good, solemn earnest?
Answer. I suppose so.
Question. No rhodomontade there? You
had got over playfulness with Wilkeson about
writing to Grant entirely, had you not?
Answer. Yes; because I had got home and
had rime to think the matter over.
Question. And having got over the playful
part of it, and thinking the matter over, you
had come to the conclusion to use force ; and
having come to that conclusion, why did you
not ?
Answer. Because I reflected that it would
not answer.
Question. Why not answer ?
Answer. It would produce difficulty, and I
did not want to bring it on.
Question. What kind of difficulty?
Answer. I supposed bloodshed.
Question. And what else?
Answer. Nothing else.
Question. Then by difficulty you mean blood-
shed, do you say?
Answer. If I had used force I suppose 1
would have been resisted with force, and blood
might have been shed. That is my answer.
Question. What time did you leave Burleigh
or did Burleigh leave you?
Answer. It was after night when he came;
the visit was a very short one.
Question. About what time did he leave?
Answer. I do not recollect exactly; eight
or nine o'clock, I suppose.
Question. Immediately after he left did you
go to a masquerade ball ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Iiow late did you stay ?
Answer. I stayed until about the time of—•
I suppose it was toward midnight.
Question. After ?
Answer. I cannot be positive of that. About
midnight, 1 presume.
Question. How soon was it after Burleigii
left before you left for the ball?
Answer. 1 think it was about nine o'clock or
along about half past nine or somewhere there.
It was after Burleigh left.
Question. Did you see anybody but your own
family between the time Burleigh left and the
time you started for the ball?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Who?
Answer. A little girl living next door, who
was going with my daughter to the masquerade
ball.
Question. A young lady ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. You did not discuss this matter
with her, 1 take it V
Answer. I did not.
Question. Did you discuss it with anybody
after you left Bi iu.iugii or Buiu.uiail left you
until you got to the balL?
Answer. I did not. 1 saw no person to dis-
cuss it with.
Question. And you did not discuss it at the
ball?
Answer. I did not.
Question. And a masquerade ball—I do.not
know, but, I put it interrogatively—is not a
good place for contemplation of high ministe-
rial official duties, is it?
Ansicer. No ; it is not.
Question. You did not. contemplate your offi-
cial duties there, did you ?
Answer. I went there, I say, to take charge
of two little girls. That was all.
Question. And to throw off care, as we all
have a right to do ?
Answer. No, sir; I did not go with any such
purpose. I hud promised them some days
before.
Question. You went with them?
Answer. I went with them to take charge of
them. I went in my piesent dress. [The uni-
form of a major general.]
Question. And when you came home you
went to bed immediately?
Answer. I did.
! Question. How early in the morning—how
| long had you been up before this marshal came?
! Answer. I generally rise about seven, unless
j when I go to market. I get up earlier then.
| Question. How early did you get up this
! morning, having been out a little late the night
! before?
Answer. I got up at seven o'clock; that is
my usual hour.
Question. Did the marshal come immedi-
ately ?
Answer. The marshal came there about eight
o'clock.
Question. Before you could get any break-
fast?
Answer. Before I had my breakfast.
Question. Did you consult anybody on this
question between the time of getting up and
the time the marshal came ?
Answer. I did not.
„ Question. Now, sir, before this the last you
said to anybody on this question was that you
told Burleigii in solemn earnest you were
going to use force, and then, almost imme-
diately, you went to a ball; from the ball you
came home and went to bed ; got up, and saw
nobody until the marshal came. When did
you change your mind from this solemn de-
termination to use force, although it might
bring on bloodshed?
Answer. I changed it after I had made use
of this to Burleigh, undoubtedly.
Question. I know you did after. When?
Answer. I suppose very soon.
Question. I did not ask you what your sup-
position is. I asked you when you changed
your mind.
Answer. I do not know.
Question. When do you first remember hav-
ing changed your mind?
Answer. I do not know.
Question. What is the first remembrance
that you have of a different purpose?
Answer. I do not know. You are asking
now as to a point of time.
Question. No; I am asking no point of
time, liu have now a different purpose in
your mind, have you not, from what you told
Burleigh?
Answer. I have.
Question. You must have obtained that pur-
pose some time. When did you change the
purpose? The first time you remember you
had a different purpose?
Answer. I certainly changed it before I was
arrested, and that was at eight o'clock on the
morning of the 22d.
Question. How do you fix that so certainly?
Answer. Because on the 22d I had determined
not to do so.
Question. What time on the 22d?
Answer. Before I was arrested, undoubtedly.
Question. Why "undoubtedly?"
Answer. I may have thought it over in bed
before I got up.
Question. Will you swear that you did, and
that you changed your purpose then?
Answer. I cannot tell the precise moment
when 1 changed my purpose.
Question. Did you not tell Mr. Burleigh that
the reason why you did not carry out your
purpose was the cause of your arrest ?
Answer. I did not.
Question. Did you tell him anything to that
effect ?
Answer. No.
Question. Had you any conversation on that
subject with him?
Answer. 1 did not see Dr. Burleigh after
that, I do not think.
Question. He testified that within a week of
the time he was on the stand you told him that
the reason why you did not carry out the
purpose which you had told him you would of
using force, was that you were arrested?
Answei. lie must have misundeistood me
then, because the arrest had nothing to do
with it.
Question. And you did not tell him that ?
Answer. I think not.
Question. Do you know not?
Answer. I will not say I know not; but I am
pretty certain I did not.
Question. What makes you certain you did
not tell him so?
Answer. Because I had made up my mind
not to use force at all.
Were you not asked by the board
