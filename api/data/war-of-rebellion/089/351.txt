Enemy building a line of rifle-pits from Cox's Ferry in a southwest direction in rear of other works. Buildings at the ferry are being torn down on south side of the river. Think the enemy has mounted two guns in a work to their right of three-gun battery near the river, bearing toward the Eighteenth Army Corps lines to the left of Fort Harrison; also building a battery a short distance to their left of the two-angled battery on north side of river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
