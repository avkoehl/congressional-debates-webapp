It is difficult to furnish any accurate estimate of the losses of the enemy, but they are supposed by the principal officers of my command to be fully as great as our own in killed and wounded, and by many supposed to largely exceed ours. I need hardly add that it is with feelings of the most profound pain and regret that I find myself called upon to record a defeat and the loss and suffering incident to a reverse at a point so far distant from the base of supplies and re-enforcements. Yet there is some consolation in knowing that the army fought nobly while it did fight, and only yielded to overwhelming numbers.

The strength of the enemy is variously estimated by my most intelligent officers at from 15,000 to 20,000 men. A very intelligent sergeant who was captured and remained five days in the hands of the enemy reports the number of the enemy actually engaged to have been 12,000, and that two DIVISIONS of infantry were held in reserve. It may appear strange that so large a force of the enemy could be in our vicinity and we be ignorant of the fact, but the surprise will exist only in the minds of those who are not familiar with the difficulty (I may even say impossibility) of acquiring reliable information in the heart of the enemy's country. Our movements and numbers are always known to the enemy because every woman and child is one of them, but we, as everybody knows who has had any experience in this war, can only learn the movements of the enemy and his numbers by actually fighting for the information, and in that case the knowledge often comes too late.

That our loss was great is true; yet, that it was not much greater is due in an eminent degree to the personal exertions of that model soldier, Colonel W. L. McMillen, of the Ninety-fifth Ohio Infantry, who commanded the infantry, and to the able commanders under him.

While I will not prolong this already extended report by recording individual acts of good conduct and the names of many brave officers and men who deserve mention, but will respectfully refer you for these to the reports of DIVISION and brigade commanders, yet I cannot refrain from expressing my high appreciation of the valuable services rendered
