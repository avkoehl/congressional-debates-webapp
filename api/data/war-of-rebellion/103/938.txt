Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Columbus, Miss.:

Yours of 20th just received, and orders are issued at once to establish the line, which will be complete by the time this reaches you. It will be difficult to get subsistence for couriers on the line unless it be sent up from the railroad. Enemy at Huntsville are getting supplies together. Say they will move south at early day via Tuscaloosa and to Selma. The Fourth Army Corps, General Wood commanding, are in camp at Huntsville; the railroad being guarded by cavalry from Decatur to Huntsville. Bridge timbers are being delivered at Decatur to build railroad bridge. Infantry force between Huntsville and Stevenson variously estimated at from 10,000 to 18,000.
