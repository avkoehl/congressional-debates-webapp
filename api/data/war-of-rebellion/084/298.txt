SAINT JOSEPH, July 20, 1864.

Major L. C. MATLACK,

Glasgow:

Thornton and his confederate fiends are this morning in Livingston County, twenty miles southwardly from Chillicothe. He has about 400 men. He will probably move into Carroll and may attempt to cross the Missouri River. You will at once unite with Major Leonard and move in light marching order rapidly in the direction of Chillicothe. Gather all the information you can and add to your force very loyal man who has a shotgun. Fall upon and exterminate the villains wherever you find them. We must strike quickly and surely.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, July 20, 1864.

General FISK:

In case of emergency shall I have power to order commanding officer at Macon City and Sturgeon to re-enforce us? I have been waiting for Matlack since 7 a.m. to leave. He has most of his men out. I think we shall leave shortly.

R. LEONARD,

Major Ninth Missouri State Militia.

GLASGOW, July 20, 1864.

General C. B. FISK:

Captain Holloway was in Roanoke yesterday evening. Made a speech to the citizens. Said he merely came to take their arms. He also told them the Feds had landed 400 men at Glasgow, and had sent 400 more up the river, but as soon as himself and Perkins got their forces together he would be ready for the 400 at Glasgow. He was seen this morning at or near his mother's. His force at Roanoke was twenty-seven men. We will organize one company this p.m. of fifty-three men. Major Matlack is giving good satisfaction. When are you going to make me a visit?

B. W. LEWIS.

CAMERON, July 20, 1864.

General FISK:

Kingston is in possession of the bushwhackers. Their forces is about 400. Can you send troops to act in conjunction with our forces in order to check them at this point? There are about 100 men here. Send them immediately if you can.

GEO. SMITH.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 20, 1864.

GEORGE SMITH:

I have hardly a soldier in Saint Joe. Have sent out to every camp to see if any can be raised for you. Will know in a few moments. When did the guerrillas come to Kingston? Who leads them? Are you not mistaken as to number?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
