effect on either side, other than to keep the enemy at a distance (during the day). We had but one man injured during the fire to-day, viz, Private Green B. Smallwood, Company A, Twelfth Georgia Battalion, severely wounded.

Battery Gregg is badly in need of shell. Please have them furnished at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

-----

Total.................................................. 1,131

At 9.30 p.m. last evening I opened fire on the enemy's lines in front of us, and continued it until 4.30 this morning, at an interval of thirty minutes between each gun. Daylight this morning exhibited the fact that our fire kept the enemy from working on his fortifications in our front.

The enemy returned our fire with about three shots to our one, using mostly his Parrott guns. About 11 o'clock this morning, three wooden gunboats approached this battery and opened fire on Fort Sumter with Parrott guns at long range. I opened on them with 32-pounder rifled gun; fired 3 shots, which fell short, but the boats ceased fire and moved off, although they were already out of our range. The enemy shelled this place from two mortar-boats for about two hours this morning, doing no damage. I would respectfully ask that ordnance and other requisitions be more promptly filled than is being done at present. On this account, I could use only four guns last night, but am ready to use the whole battery to-night.

Steady and rapid firing has been kept up all to-day between sharpshooters of enemy and ours, resulting in wounding 1 man on our side viz, Private John A. Hartness, Company A, Lucas' battalion, arm broken.

Respectfully submitted.

GEO. P. HARRISON, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
