HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE, Chattanooga Valley, November 15, 1863-5 p. m.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON,Commanding on Lookout:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Hardee desires me to say, in reply to your communication of this date in reference to Johnson's Crook and Nickajack, that General Bragg to-day promised to have Johnson's Crook securely guarded by cavalry. General Hardee wishes you to post such an infantry force at Nickajack as you may think sufficient to hold it.

I am, general, very respectfully,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MISSION RIDGE, November 15, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Please send to the regiments as soon as convenient all extra-duty men, stragglers, and convalescents left behind by the troops you have sent me. Sherman will be up in a few days. Major-General Lee has done noble service in North Alabama, and delayed him nearly a month-a time of great value to us.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

Publications in violation of orders have recently appeared in the public journals giving information of the organization of this army and of changes made therein. All such publications are highly improper and are positively prohibited. Commanding officers furnishing or allowing copies of orders to be furnished form their headquarters to persons not entitled to receive them, will be held responsible for their publication.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

To enable the commissary department to meet the heavy demands upon it, for the present three-quarters of a pound of fresh meat will be the daily ration, and in lieu of the deficiency, the ration of rice will be increased to 10 pounds to 100 rations, and an issue of sugar will be made at the rate of 18 pounds in lieu of 100 pounds of meat. These issues will be regularly and promptly made. Nothing but an impossibility will be accepted as an excuse, and that must be promptly reported by the commissaries to their respective commanders at the time of the failure.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
