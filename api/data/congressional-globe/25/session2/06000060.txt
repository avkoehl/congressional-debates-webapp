which continued for some time.]
Mr CALHOUN replied, that if he hadieally
been inconsistent, as the Senator upposes, n ie-
ieruiee to the bank, he might find Trustification in
the example of the Senator himself The only
difference between them would be, that the Senatoi
had changed from an anti-bank to a bank man,
and he from a bank to an anti-bank man
The subject of the bank, and the consistent v oí
himself aid the Senator, had been graltulou iy in
traduced, and did not belong to the rpi tion un l< i
consideiauon, but as the Senat< r ha I thought pio-
per to make th< charge of inconsistent <, h lelt
called on to repel il
II", then, had nevei bnen in any pi ip i sen c
r[ the teim, a bank man, as he had been opposed
to thes}stem e\er since hf hid formed i delibeiaK
and mature opinion in relation to it- It is hue, lie
supported the (hanermg the late Bink of the
United States m 1816, but it is no less true that he
was opposed to the system at that lime, and sq ex-
pressed himself in his op-mng sptecrr on the que
tion In supporting the bank then, he yielded to
what he believed to be the neces'ity oí the cae,
growing out ol the connection between the Grot em-
inent and the banks—a connection umeh on-
ginaled telore his time, an I «as \m ml his cin-
tro! Ht tnen si id tKat, olcn„<> tinte nice ion
existed—so long ?s tine Government r cened and
tieated bank notes as gold and snver—it «as boun 1
to regulate the banks, and that a Bank of the
United States was the only efficient and legitimate
means of effecting it, and such is still his opinion
If, then, his course m 1816 and now, was differ-
ent} in i elation to the bank, it must be traced to
a change of circumstances, and not to a
change of opinion At the former period, the con-
nection between the Government and -the banks
existed with no prospect ot its termination, or the
possibility of rescinding it, but, now, fortunate!},
it has ceased by operado i of law , and he, fur trie
fiist time since he had been in public life, was fiee
to take a position in reference to the bank m con-
formity to his principles Pour jcars ago, on
questions growing oat of the removal ot the de-
posites, he exphcitely ayem ed his opinion, in the
strongest terms, against the system It this was
the only chaige of inconsistency that could be
brought against him in a long jioliticai life, he had
reason certainly to congratulate himself as-not be-
ing inconsistent, and he certainly had as much
right to aecuse the Senator of separating from him,
as he had to make the charge against him.
Mi. Calhoun's Resolution*—Mr. Calhoun.
But the Senator is not content with making the
chaigt of inconsistency He makes the grave ac-
cusition against hun of alluding to the possible
dissolution ot the Union, but loitunately for him,
theie «as but a slight diffeience be in ceu the Sena-
tor and hinioelf m íeference to this accusation

Union, tne Stnatoi \v hen the B ink is the subject of

and he might with as much justice charge the Se-
nator with hostility to the Union, as he had him

Mr CALHOUN replied, tint the Senator draws

Pour years si ici, on an occisión not less memoia
ble, he made the strongest Iccleration against the
s\«(em which starda on record, and yet the Senator
does not lecollect t, and witn what propriety,
then, can the Sen«Ji r ventuie to appeal to the ab
sence of his lecollection on the same subject twen-
ty-two years since, with the view of impeaching
the correctness of his memory'
Mr CLAY said he would not conlroverI the as-
sertion of the gentleman, but he had not heard
him
The Senate then adjourned
MR   CALHOUN't  RESOLUTIONS
DEBATE IN THE SENATE,
WEDM.SDAT, Jan 10, 1838
The Senate resumed the consideration of the fifth
of these «solutions, together with the substitute
offered yesterday by Mr   CLAY, m relation to
Senate.
slavery in the District of Columbia and the Terri-
tories
Mr CALHOUN rose and said that he had ex-
amined the amendment of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, (Mr Clay,) which had been offered as a
substitute for the fifth resolution, and that it was
impossible for him to bring his mind to give it his
support, or to vote for it if it should be adopted m
any thing like its present shape. He would very
very briefly state his reason"
It, in the fiist place entirely abandoned the Ter-
rirones to the Abolitionists His fifth resolution
covered both this Distuct and the Territories, but
the amendment wholly omitted the latter, and left
them defenceless to the invasion of the foe
He next objected, that it conceded, by almost
necessary implication, the right of Congress to ap-
propriate the public funds to purchase'and emanci-
pate slaves, a concession among the most danger-
ous and unconstitutional that could be made. If
once admitted, it would be very easy to complete
the end the Abolitionists have m view, and that
wholly at our expense If we yield that point, the
woik will soon be consummated
His nevt objection was, that it impliedly admit-
ted it to be the duty of Congress to receive and dis-
cuss petitions to abolish slavery in the District in
his opinion a most unfouneled and dangerous as-
sumption, but he had so fully expressed his opi-
nion on that point, on former occasions, that he
would not now occupy the time of the Senate in
repeating the reasons for his opinion
He finally objected, that the tone of the amend-
ment, and of the remarks with which it wa-s
ushered in, was altogether too low for the subject
and the occasion He was adverse to all violence
of language, in the expression of legislative opi-
nions, but when the sublet was one of such un-
provoked ouirage on one-half the States of the
Union, and so pregnant with disastrous consequen-
ces to all, he could not leconcile it to his impres-
sion of propnety to speak in the low and subdued
tone of the amendment
For these reasons he could not vote for ihe
amendment, should it be substituted for his fifth
resolution, unless greatly modified and strength-
ened
Mr CLAY said he very seriously regretttd it,
but if the Senate would consider the subject, they
would find nothing in the objections. As to the
amendment not providing protection for the Tein-
tones, m the series efrcso'utions which Mr C had
offered yesterday, there was one that expressly pro-
vided for Florida, the only Territory concerned,
placed on the strongest grounds
As to the right of the Government to purchase
the slaves in the District, the amendment recog-
nised no such thing It simply says you ca"not
emancipate them without compensation But
whether you can do it at all or not, it does not as-
sert It says you cannot do it without compensa-
tion, but it does not say you can with compensa-
tion
My idea in framiig that resolution was to throw
around the District of Co'umbta every securtty, in
three distinct propositions One was the plighted
faith of this Government in the transaction by
which the District w as acquired The next was
that you have no right to ab jlish slavery here with-
out indemnity. The third was, that you cannot do
it without exciting a degiee of alarm m the South-
ern States of th s Union—without transcending all
the benefit  of any results I hoped these would
form a barrier that would exist for ever, or at least
till encumstances should no lo iger require it. But
I have no objections to withdraw one of them, the
two remaining ones will be sufficient
If I am right in supposing there is nothing in the
exception^ ole clause that authorizes the right to
purchasp the slaves in the District of Columbia,
ihere can be nothing whatever as it respects the
slaves in oiher parts of the Union , more especially
as m the «solution* themselves I declare the invio-
lability of slavery m the States
The Senator's third objection is to the right of
petition involved in the amendment. Sir, I warn
the Senate that there can be no continuance of the
invasion of the right to petition Mr -C men-
tioned a State Legislature that had now «ndet con-
