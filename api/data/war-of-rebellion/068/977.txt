MAY 8, 1864-10.15 p.m.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Shingler reports that he drove in the pickets three times. There were at least three brigades within a mile or two of Ware Bottom bridge toward James River. Two extensive lines of campfires are visible; one toward James River, the other toward Petersburg. Heard what he thought a slight engagement this evening. I suppose the same firing that General Johnson reports as against Clifton Heights. An infantry scout drove in the pickets this afternoon near Ware Bottom Church. Saw line of breast-works and tents behind them.
