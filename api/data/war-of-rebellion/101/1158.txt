FORT SMITH, ARK., Marc 12, 1865.

Major J. K. MOREY, Van Buren:

A force of rebels estimated at 1,000, with two pieces of artillery, are reported by Colonel Stephenson moving up the river from Petit Jean. They may attempt to cross the Arkansas at Ivey's Crossing. Colonel Stephenson has a force watching that point. The Carrie Jacobs passed Clarksville coming up yesterday. I fear she is aground at More's Rock. Keep on the alert and report any information you get.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, Miss., March 12, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt to- day of your letter of the 4th instant. It had been to Memphis and back. I have never received your letter of the 2nd instant, referring to the Eleventh New York and Twelfth Illinois Cavalry. All the regiments called for were, when I left Memphis, absent on the expedition toward Grenada, ordered from your headquarters, and therefore a great delay will not occur from the time already lost. I inclose for your information copies of letters I have written to Major-General Washburn and Major-General Thomas to- day asking for the regiments your order.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
