Colonel GRAHAM,

Commanding Hagood's Brigade:

General Bragg directs that as soon as steamers Harllee and Sampson arrive from Fort Anderson you embark your men and proceed to Fort Fisher. You will have to land at Battery Buchanan, the enemy occupying Craig's Landing. Please the captains of the steamers that they are to bring back to Hander Hall from Fort Fisher companies.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865.

Colonel GRAHAM:

I have just received a signal dispatch from Fort Anderson to the effect that the Sampson will be at Gander Hall at 7.30 p. m., but that the Harllee cannot go in there. You must use the Sampson as a lighter to load the Harllee, which I have ordered to come as near as possible. There is a signal station at Sugar Loaf by which you can communicate with Fort Anderson. Use General Bragg's name to get off as soon as possible.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Sugar Loaf, January 14, 1865 - 12 m.

Major-General HOKE:

On careful consideration the commanding general deems it of the highest importance to break the enemy's line, if possible, and he hopes you may be able to do it by a judicious use if artillery, they having none. Once broken, we ought to be able to prevent their fortifying another line.

I am, very respectfully, &c.,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 2 p. m.

Major-General HOKE:

Your general views, as expressed in the note by Major Adams, will be adopted by the commanding general. he desires you will select a good line, as near the enemy as practicable, and intrench your position, taking carer not to open your left flank to the enemy's view, and securing as strong a position on your left from which with artillery to cut the enemy's communication with his landing point. This will distress him, and if he is forced to land supplies, &c., as near as his right to Fisher, the heavy guns will destroy his boats. The general directs that 1,000 of Hagood's brigade be sent by dusk to Gander Hall Landing for transportation to Fisher. Nearly 600 men are ordered to return from there,
