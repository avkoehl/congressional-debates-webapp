re-organized at once. Major Patterson had better call for a court of inquiry in regard to the surrender. His case may be all satisfactory. We hope so. We don't hear from the raiders lately.

Lieutenant-Colonel DUCAT,

Asst. Insp. General, Department of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: Owing to changes in the corps, no picket reports were received from Second and Fourth Divisions yesterday. I have visited the pickets this morning and find the enemy are at work busily with axes all along our front. They seem to be in heavy force in the valley, as brass bands and martial music are distinctly heard all along our front. Their picket is much stronger than usual and discharged their arms by volley this morning very near our line.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. BARKER,

Captain, and Actg. Asst. Insp. General, 14th Army Corps.

Colonel HODGES,

Assistant Quartermaster, Nashville:

Colonel Innes has been directed to send as follows: First, troops; second, rations and forage; third, beef and forage, fourth, army transportation.

Colonel Scott requested to measure capacity of Louisville road, and to report accordingly, and to use the road to the best advantage. I want to know what forage you have in Nashville; what the country in that neighborhood will afford; what at intermediate points, and what at Stevenson.

Edwards says materials are wanted for the steam-boat. Let nothing be wanted. Make the amplest arrangements for bringing corn and storing along the road. Make the price liberal. See that they are paid down.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Telegraph this to Stevenson to show to General Hooker.
