headquarters and provost-marshal, complete; an addition to commissary store-house, 24 by 100 feet; quartermaster's store-house, 20 by 40; provost court room, 12 by 20; new condenser, 25 by 35, with splendid machinery and in working order, all complete. The old condenser, 25 by 40 feet, with machinery, is in pretty good repair. Both new and old can furnish fresh water for 5,000 or 6,000 troops. The old wharf is in good repair, with a wrecked schooner for wharf boat. A new wood spades, shovels, &amp;c., by the quantity, and plenty of clothing, camp and garrison equipage for the troops on the island. Two large flat-boats, twelve yawls, and a small schooner, used as a pilot boat, constitute our water transportation on the bay. We have twenty-odd bales of cotton to be sent to Treasury Department as soon as collected. The main fortification at this place is in progress of completion, mounting at this time - guns of heavy caliber. An earth-work and fortification are almost complete at Boca Chica Pass, with curtains and traverses for riflemen. Four companies guard the pass. The damming of the pass has not yet been commenced. Finally, the force here can defend the island from any reasonable or probable assault, and four times our number could not dislodge us. I would further state that no attack here at present is apprehended from any source. The trouble in Mexico has subsisted, and our commercial agent is quietly exercising the functions of his office at Matamoras. The furore about Cortina marching on that place has blown over, and although Cortina has practically turned his back on Maximilian, it is not likely he will make any demonstration until our army moves. Authority has lately been given to Mr. J. H. Fisk by Major-General Canby to raise a company of Texans for the Second Texas Cavalry. The organization is progressing rapidly. A post garden has been established with promise of success. The area cultivated is about four acres. All quiet here as usual.

I have the honor to be, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Gulf:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of instructions from general headquarters, relating to the irregular and illicit travel which has been permitted via this post from New Orleans to Matamoras and return. As soon as these instructions were received the remedy was applied. Why this thing had been permitted so long was a matter of some solicitation with me, but was informed upon my arrival here that it was allowed by all those who proceeded me. I am satisfied that the injury done the Government and the cause far overbalances the advantage derived from the few thousand dollars received of these speculators for transportation on Government steamers. You may rest assured that these follies will not be repeated in the future as long as it may continue to be my honor to command at this post.

I have the honor to be, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. JONES,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S. - That latest and interesting news will be forwarded even date therewith.
