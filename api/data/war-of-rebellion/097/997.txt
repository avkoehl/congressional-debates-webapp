I will communicate the dispatches to him. I am expecting every moment to hear that he is at Roanoke Station. I have seven days' rations for the troops from this morning, and whether I shall need all that you have sent will depend upon the length of stay I am to make here. I am issuing about 22,000 rations daily.
