CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

In the Field, June 25, 1864.

General Johnston has observed in the daily newspapers published statistical tables of our losses during specific periods, thus placing such information in a convenient form for the use of our enemies. He desires, therefore, in future, that corps commanders will prevent, as far as possible, such publications.

By command of General Johnston:

A. P. MASON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
