THE OO^GEESSIONAL GLOBE.

used daily were under one million dollars. For
this data I am indebted. to a former eminent
member of this House, (Golonel Stebbins.)
This experience of New York tallies very
closely with the testimony in the parliamentary
report, that it only requires about three per
cent, in money to liquidate all payments in
modern trading. If it were not mischievous
it would be ridiculous to claim that there is a
necessity for the continuance of our present
excessive amount of paper money.
Mr. Charles Buller, in the House of Com-
mons, stated that the amount of bank paper in
1834 was between twenty-six and twenty-seven
million pounds, while the amount of bills of
exchange in circulation at one time in the
same year was £i82,123,000, or five times the
amount of bank notes.
On the 1st day of January, 1866, the whole
bank capital of the country amounted to
$403,357,346; but a much more active and
larger capital was made up of individual de-
posits, which at the same date amounted to
$518,608,888. By means of the checks of
depositors this may be and is drawn out daily,
and by checks of other depositors or other
bankable funds an egual amount may be depos-
ited. At the same time it is perfectly safe for
any bank to calculate that at the close of busi-
ness each day the sum total of the deposits will
remain nearly unchanged, and thereby the
basis of discounts is very much enlarged.
Thus the credit of individuals at the banks
plays by far the most important figure in mod-
ern financial transactions, and does away with
the necessity of a large volume of bank note
circulation, besides more than doubling the
aggregate working capital of the banks.
An unvarying standard of money has been
the desideratum of the world, but it has not yet
been found. Gold and silver have been almost
universally accepted as the nearest approxi-
mation to that end, because these metals have
great intrinsic value in proportion to weight,
and are portable and durable. But a bushel of
grain in old and long-settled countries has been
considered a more unvarying standard of prices
than even gold, on the ground that it requires
a more uniform amount of labor to produce it.
But a uniform standard, however desirable,
appears impossible. Labor in one country is
worth more than in another, and worth more
in cities and towns than in rural districts,
because money is there more abundant and
purchases less of the absolute necessaries of
life. Educated or skilled labor is more val-
uable than the uneducated, because more pro-
ductive. Labor is worth more in the spring-
time and harvest than in winter, notwithstand-
ing it costs the laborer more in clothing, food,
and exposure, because in the winter unem-
ployed laborers become abundant. Agricul-
tural labor being interrupted, many who follow
it in its season pursue the trade of artisans
during the winter, and thereby depress the
prices of such labor iu towns and cities.
Prairie lands combined with labor-saving agri-
cultural implements have reduced the price of
grain in the Western States, but the labor to
effect distant transportation prevents any very
large reduction in the prices which the world
at large continues to pay. A day's work in
the United States may be worth twice as much
as in Mexico; but if one thousand men in the
United States produce one thousand ounces
of gold or silver for the same amount of labor
it requires in Mexico to produce two hundred
and fifty ounces, transportation no longer inter-
feres,"and the price in Mexico will fall one
half, or it will take twice as much gold or sil-
ver to make the same purchase as before. It
is to "be noted, however, that Chinese labor,
being that largely employed in our mining
regions, is quite as cheap as that employed in
Mexican mines.
In point of fact the surpassing abundance of
the precious metals, especially that of gold,
discovered within the last eighteen years—Cali-
fornia being already eclipsed by the Colonies
of Great Britain—and the facility and cheap-
ness with which they are obtained, has so
cheapened the markets of the world that gold
itself has rapidly depreciated and nowhere
purchases as much as it would in 1850. So
copious are the supplies, multiplied suddenly
at so many different points on the globe, that
it may be expected at an early day to be valued,
like any other article, at no more than the cost
of extraction. Whether the enormous increase
of the precious metals may not ultimately
destroy them as a measure of value,, as was
apprehended upon the first opening of the
golden treasures of «Califorriia and Australia,
remains yet to be seen. The extraordinary
drain of silver to the Asiatic nations will not
forever postpone the question. It seems prob-
able, however, if this drain should continue
even for a short time longer that all nations will
either abandon the use of silver coins or they
must speedily debase them. Otherwise their
commercial price so mucl/ exceeds the cur-
rency value as compared with gold they will be
melted up. In 1800 the value of gold produced
stood to that of silver in the proportion of
twenty-eight to seventy-two in a total of
$54,000,000; but in 1863, when the production
had been quintupled, the proportions were
nearly reversed, and gold stood as sixty-seven
to thirty-three. In fact the increase of silver is
small, while gold has quadrupled. Macaulay's
New Zealander may find among other wonders
a thousand years hence a pound of silver valued
at fifteen pounds of gold.
In 1830 it was estimated that for the preced-
ing nineteen years the average annual produc-
tion of the precious metals had fallen off about
$31,000,000 from what it had been prior to
that time.

000,000. The accessions to this general stock
of gold in the world since have-been prodigious,
but prior to 1848, for more than thirty years,
the annual supplies did not much more than
eqnal the annual waste. I am not able to
obtain any consecutive returns of the amount
produced in Mcxico, South America, Russia,
or Africa, and only imperfect returns of what
has been produced in the United States and in
Australia, but it is known that1 productions
have been increasing largely, and probably the
aggregate annual production in the United
States alone is now nearly equal to the amount
produced by both the United States and Aus-
tralia a few years ago.

These estimates, made up from different
sources and from different stand-points, serve
to prove each other, and beyond doubt are
very near the truth.
Within the last ten years, for which I have
no returns, the very reliable estimates already
given for 1863 and 1866 would show that more
than treble the amount has been produced than
for the six years for which I have given the
returns. These facts conclusively show, apart
from the action of a paper currency, that gold
must have irremediably fallen in intrinsic value.
It has become cheap by its abundance. What
occurred after the discovery of the silver minos
of Potosi in 1545 is again stamping itself upon
history. • There is, therefore, no occasion for
any other depreciation than that which must
inevitably befall us on account of the annual
addition which has been and will be made to
the general stock of gold and silver in the
world for generations yet to come.
We keep up mints and assay offices at great
expense, but it is clear that on the whole not
one fourth part of the sums coined are retained
by the country. Of all we have coined, in
other words, three fourths or more has left the
country. The impress of the American eagle
gives no patriotism to coin, and it changes its
allegiance—as did the coins of other nations in
past ages, though forbid by Draconian laws—•
whenever tempted by any interest possibly
computable. The following table shows the
work of our mints and assay office since first
established:
Gold coinage is $845,536,600 79
Silver coinage is.    136,351,812 96
Copper coinage is  5,535,623 55
$987,424,037 30
Where is it? Most of it has disappeared,
rated at the value of the pure metal contained,
and not a whit advanced by the artists of the
Mint.
Among other modes of reducing the standard
value of money, Congress began as early as
1837 by debasing our gold and silver coins,
and declared that of one thousand parts nine
hundred should be of pure metal and one hun-
dred parts alloy. The standard of British gold
is one part alloy in every twelve;- but we have
.no coins which are not debased at least one
part in every ten. At that time gold could be
more profitably exported than silver, and this
measure was designed not only to make the
legal value of the two equivalent to their rela-
tive commercial value, but to bring gold into
more general circulation. Neither object was
secured. The rates of value, of fifteen or six-
teen to one, soon became obsolete, and gold
coins, although the standard was purposely
placed below that of silver, were still exported.
In order to retain in the country any silver,
which, being worth more than its legal-tender
value, bore a premium and was sold as a com-
modity, it then became necessary to reduce the
weight of the silver coinage, and the half dollar
in 1853 was reduced from two hundred and
six and a quarter grains to one hundred and
ninety-two grains, and fractional parts to the
same proportion. Silver dollars at oncc dis-
appeared, and eagles bearing date prior to
1837, being worth in proportion to the new
eagles $10 66, also disappeared. The weight
of these in 1791, standard gold, was two hundred
and seventy grains, but in 1837 they were
reduced to two hundred and fifty-eight grains.
The debasement of our coinage, never entirely
pure, was thus about seven per cent.
Foreign coins, beyond our power to debase,
