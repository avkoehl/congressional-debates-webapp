and inexperienced, there is not a better man in all my acquaintance than he. I say nothing about his own personal advancement, because I know you appreciate that as much as any one can. General Wright will, I have no doubt, consider him as his share of engineer detail to his corps, if but one is allowed. I will agree to do my share without any one, so that Gillespie, who has been assigned to me, can be sent elsewhere. I am so prejudiced, it may be in my opinion that I would let every engineer officer we have take a regiment in the army, if he can get the commission.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 9, 1864-9 a.m. (Received 9.20 a.m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

There is nothing of interest to report from my front this morning. Working parties were engaged during the night in strengthening our works, and the enemy was similarly employed. Considerable firing on these parties during the night from both sides.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 9, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

General Willcox reports the ordinary amount of picket-firing in his front. General Potter reports a slight increase in the picket-firing, owing to the enemy's desire to trouble his working parties. All quiet in front of First Division.

Respectfully,

P. M. LYDIG,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,June 9, 1864-8.45 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

All is quiet in my front.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 9, 1864-9 a.m.

Major General W. F. SMITH.

The commanding general desires to have, as soon as practicable, the number of wounded recovered and dead buried in front of your lines during the armistice of the evening of the 7th instant, and also whether any of the enemy's wounded were brought in or dead buried at the time by your command.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
