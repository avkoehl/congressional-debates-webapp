Major General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: It has just been reported to me by a colonel on my line (Colonel Russell, Third Louisiana) that cavalry and infantry are moving down the Baldwin's Ferry road to the Ferguson house, and turning to their left at that point move toward your position. Some of the troops continue down the Baldwin's Ferry road without turning off at Ferguson's. He thinks there are about 400 cavalry and a division of infantry. Some of the enemy's men told some of our men yesterday during the truce that the movement of the enemy eyesterday was not troops changing position from t he left to the right, but infantry (about 3,000) moving down tot he line from Snyder's under command of a General Orme.

I am, general, very respectfully,

JOHN H. FORNEY,

Major-General.
