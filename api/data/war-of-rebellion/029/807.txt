many as five different persons had been shot down in the attempt to bear the colors, Logan H. Nelson, a private in Company C [who is but a youth], gallantly sprang forward, raised them from the side of dying comrades, and bore them nobly and triumphantly throughout the remainder of this bloody contest.

It will be seen that this report only relates to the conduct of the regiment in Friday's fight. Having been in command of the brigade prior to that time, and not having been able to join the regiment since, I refer to the reports submitted by Lieutenant-Colonel Butler for an account of its operations on other days of the battle of Murfreesborough. Unable to prepare this report earlier, I beg leave now to present it.

Very respectfully,

J. B. PALMER,

Colonel, Commanding Eighteenth Tennessee Volunteers.

HDQRS. FIRST [SECOND] BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, LIEUTENANT-GENERAL HARDEE'S CORPS, Camp near Tullahoma, Tenn., January 11, 1863.
