HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF INDIAN TERRITORY,Fort Washita, June 26, 1865.

Captain T. M. SCOTT,

Adjt. General, District of Indian Territory, near McKinney, Tex.:

CAPTAIN: I have to inclose copy of terms upon which General E. K. Smith has surrendered the Trans-Mississippi Department. * As yet I have received no official information or instructions from department headquarters. The terms were received here on the 23rd instant, as published in the Houston Telegraph. It will, of course, be necessary that proper steps be taken to collect and surrender the "troops and public property" of this district. You will please report at these headquarters as soon as possible to assist me in the discharge of my duties, and to secure to the officers and men of the army of this district the benefits of the amnesty, according to the stipulations contained in the agreement between General Smith and Major-General Canby, entered into at New Orleans May 26, 1865. No doubt commissioners on the part of the United Sates will be here soon to receive the surrender of this district. The country is quiet, and no danger in traveling alone.

Respectfully,

D. H. COOPER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S. -Federal commissioners and commissioners from the several Indian nations met at Armstrong Academy on 28th instant to make a treaty of peace, and I hope we may secure amnesty and discharge for all prisoners of war belonging to the troops of this district. This would save a vast amount of trouble and expense.
