HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS, &amp;C.,Little Rock, Ark., September 6, 1864-4.05 p.m.

Major General J. A. MOWER,

Commanding First Division, Sixteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Please bring your division to Devall's Bluff as soon as practicable. It can be of no use to me at Saint Charles. I am anxious to put an end to the bold career of Fagan and Shelby, and hope with your assistance to make quick work of it.

Very respectfully,

F. STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., September 6, 1864

Lieutenant LUKE O'REILLY,

Aide-de-Camp, General Mower's Staff;

Please direct the cavalry division under Colonel Winslow to cross at Clarendon and come up on this side of Devall's Bluff. They would save ten miles by coming direct to Brownsville, from whence an expedition against Fagan and Shelby will be fitted out. They will find good grazing on this route. General Andrews will send a guide with you. Distance to Brownsville is about thirty miles. The road on north side of White River to Augusta involves several bad crossings. Water is very scarce, and no forage. Some forage can be sent to Clarendon and more obtained at Brownsville.

FREDK. STEELE,

Major-General.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

DEAR SIR; General Steele informs me by telegraph that Price is on the Saline with a large force threatening Little Rock. Cabell's brigade (cavalry) is at Benton, twenty-five miles from Little Rock, and our scouts have been followed back almost to our picket-lines. Fagan was co-operating with Price, and was reported to have a train of 150 wagons loaded with flour and bacon. General Steele thinks Price intends actually to attack Little Rock, or to threaten it while Fagan and Shelby attack our lines. Either this or Price is going into Mis-
