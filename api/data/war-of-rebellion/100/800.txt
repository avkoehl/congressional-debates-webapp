HEADQUARTERS INFANTRY,Greensborough, N. C., April 14, 1865.

Colonel OTEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to state that I have perceived within a day or two a material alteration in the morale of the troops occupying the lines on the west of Greensborough. Desertions are becoming very numerous. About 200 men of one battalion abandoned their post last night, and the remaining men of this force state oepnly their intention to return to their homes. I am far fromd esiring to impute this design to very many gallant men now under my command, but the fact of the demoralization of the majority is, I fear, indisputable. I cannot state the exact number of the men now on duty on the lines, but I shall afford a tabular report as soon as possible.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. LEVENTHORPE,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully submitted to Secretary of War.

By order:

JOHN W. RIELY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, April 14, 1865.

General LEVENTHORPE or

Governor VANCE:

The men of my regiment are very impatient under the present excitement. They are men of means and their property in different counties has been plundred by raiders and tories. The army of Generals Lee and Johnston falling back, with discouraging accounts, renders it almost impossible for me to hold them together. Please instruct me what to do.

A. M. BOOE,

Colonel, Commanding.

GREENSBOROUGH, N. C., April 15, 1865.

Major General J. M. WALKER, President of Council,

J. W. HOLLAND, Danville, Va.:

Your telegram of this date received after I had parted with General Beauregard, to whose orders, or supposed orders, it related. I have referred the telegram to him that he might reply to you.

JEFF'N DAVIS.
