TIB CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 13,
maintain herself and cultivate cotton to any
great, extent and make it profitable. The four
cotton States, of South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, and Alabama" produce 6,7,000,000
bushels of grain of all sorts, an average of
lessthan bushels to the acre planted. This
woujd require about 9,500,000 acres in its
production. This amount of acreage in cotton
would produce not less than, 2,500,000 bales
of, cotton, worth on an average seventy-five
dollars per bate, or a sum. equal to about
$200,000,000.
, Ko^.if the South could be sur? of getting
whenever'needed a cheap supply of provisions
from tjb.e West to make her cotton crops, I
hazard nothing in spying that the cotton crop
would be at least 2,000,000 more bales than it
ig at present. The cotton would be raised
cheaper than it now is by several cents in the
pound, find a ready sale abroad, and would in
a short time restore the, balance of trade in
favor of the United States.
Give to the West cheap lines of watercom-
munieation with the Southand'North, and the
result will be this: the West will grow rich by
the sale of her surplus products, the South
will be restored to wealth by the increase of
her great staple, and the North will continue
to manufacture for the whole country, and
her ship-yards will again be alive with busy
workmen, _ because there will be something
for her ships to carry from American ports.
There will then be no need for subsidies to
either railroads or steamships, because they
will then be called upon to perform a labor
which will be sufficiently remunerative to keep
them going without such aid. The West can
feed the North and South; the South will
furnish the great national staple which will
spttTe our debts abroad and keep the balance
largely in our favor, and the North can resume
her ancient carrying trade. Nothing will pro-
duce these happy results but the bringing of
the means of living in the United States within
just and proper bounds. Neither the South
soothe North can compete with the West in
raising grain. Where we in the South raise
but six, eight, and twelve bushels of corn to
the acre, the western farmer garners his sev-
enty, eighty, and one hundred bushels, and
yet we are compelled to wear out our lands in
raising grain which when gathered into our
barns costs us not less than one dollar per
bushel, because the present modes of trans-
portation are exorbitant and unreliable.
Give to the country these lines of cheap
transportation. If every dollar were given by
the General Government for their construc-
tion, the money would be returned to the
country fiftyfold in a few years. They will
induce immigration, furnish remote sections
with supplies which they want and which they
cannot otherwise get, will be a check upon
railroads, keep up the supply as it is needed,
regulate exchanges, and most of all they will
be the means of settling our foreign accounts
annually and leave a balance in our favor.
Unless we devise sogae means to do this—and
X see no better way than by stimulating the
growth of cotton in the South, and furnishing
an outlet to the West for her immense grain
crops~~there will be a constant drain of gold
and silver to the other side of the Atlantic,
and resumption of specie payments will be
indefinitely deferred.
ovk foreign indebtedness.
• *noJneB^'s glance at the statement of our
indebtedness abroad must convince every one
that measures should be instituted by Congress
to lessen it at once. The figures are startling,
aQd notwithstanding there is great recupera-
tive power m the United States, and her re-
sources are still immense, still our pecuniary
condition is sufficient to make every friend of
the country tremble for its future prosperity.
That I might be correct in any statement that
I should make in relation to this matter, I have
consulted with Mr. Young, the national statis-
tician. I found that his attention had been
but recently called to this question, and he had
at hand the following:

above named namely:

than this, probably one thousand millions, arising
from the tact that our securities sold under par, say
at eighty-one cents on the dollar, and must be paid
at their face value.

Our indebtedness on the increase at the rate of one
hundred millions per annum.
[Extract from an article in the Mercantile Agency
Annual, New York.]
In a discussion of the above subject the conclusion
was reached that the amount of our foreign indebt-
edness did not then exceed $900,000,000. Ihe result
ot another year's trade exhibits an adverse balance
wtueh considerably increases this amount. The
?S,oforelFn 'r^e for the feeal year ended
June 30, 1872, as furnished by the chief of the na-
tional Bureau of Statistics, is exhibited in the fol-
lowing statement:

Add freights to foreign ship-owners,

value by the chief of the Bureau of
Statistics   35,633,382
Aggregate $151,779,486
The increase of our foroign indebtedness during
the past year, as indicated by the above statement,
reaches nearly $152,000,000, but this statement is
only apparent, not real, as shown by the warehouse
statement.
The value of foreign commodities remaining in
S5r^h,°?ie June 80- 1872> was $122,211,266, and only
$68,324,659 on June 30, 1871, showing an excess of
$53,886,607. Deducting this amount from the above
aggregate of $151,779,486, as above stated, and we
nave a net increase of nearly one hundred millions.
(*>97,893.279,) wbich, added to the amount stated in
last Annual, makes our aggregate foreign indebted-
ness oi $1,000,000,000. And startling as is th is immense
sum, it is rendered more calamitous by the fact that
it is increasing at the rate of $100,000,000 per annum.
With facts like these staring us in the face,
will we permit this Congress to adjourn with-
out doing something to reduce our national
debt abroad and restore the balance of trade
in our favor? Dare we look 'our impover-
ished constituents in the face and say that we
have done nothing to secure markets for their
productions? Custodians of the commerce
of the country, shall we see that great interest
forever sink, or will we make an effort to
secure the means by which we will regain our
commercial supremacy, and thereby secure our
national prosperity again ?
conclusion.
In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, permit me to
say that there is involved in this whole ques-
tion another matter which has furnished a
great deal of pleasure to those who, like my-
self, have reflected upon it. The contempla-
tion of a work like this affords the thought that
through this medium perhaps will come to the
people of the South that prosperity which she
in particular so much needs; that it will make
her sons and daughters happy and contented,
rejoicing in the prospect of comfort and peace.
Indeed, we can see in the completion of this
great work what the President of the United
States said on one occasion when a committee
of gentleman from Georgia addressed him in
relation to this enterprise, " a practical recon-
struction."
When completed, as I earnestly hope and
believe it will, it will be a monument of honor
to those who have through many difficulties,
and no little obloquy, and even against the
former policy of the South in such matters,
pressed it successfully upon the attention of
the country. It will be a great commercial
artery through which the life-blood of the
country will flow, and which will join together
a people who have been separated in feeling
because they knew so little of each other. If
such ends are accomplished by means like
this, then can it truly be said that—
"Peace hath her victories no less renowned than
war.
Seldom has it ever occurred in the history
of any people that a work like this, when once
finished, has ever been allowed to crumble and
decay. It will stand when works dedicated to
the merely beautiful have passed from the face
of man. It has been said that the tomb of
Moses is unknown, but the traveler in the
Holy Land may yet slake his thirst at the well

and wealthiest ot monarehs, with cedar, and
