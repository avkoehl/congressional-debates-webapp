General HINKS:

I have ordered some of Wild's men, what can be spared, to Spring Hill with a purpose. You need not send them back. Send them to Spring Hill, and let them remain on board the boats till morning light, and then further orders will be given. I thought you were notified of the bringing up of the men. It is a mistake you were not. Grant's movements may change a plan.

Major-General, Commanding.
