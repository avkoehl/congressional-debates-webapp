JERUSALEM PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION,

October 28, 1864 - 7 a. m.

Major B. F. FISHER:

Tents appear at all points on enemy's lines where they were seen last evening, but in less numbers. Squads of infantry moving left from our immediate front show that they had been brought there from other points of their lines farther to our left, where we were threatening their lines in our immediate front. They show but small force in works. All quiet.

Major B. F. FISHER,

Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac:

About 7 o'clock a regiment of infantry moved in sight from the east into the clearing west of station, halted a short time, and passed on out of view. They were behind the first line of works. Eight o'clock, a skirmish line has moved back behind the first line of works, while a heavy column, about 1,500, has moved in the same direction east, back of the rear line of works. Just now a column of about the same size has moved back to the west again.
