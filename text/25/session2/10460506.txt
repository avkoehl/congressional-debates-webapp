labor can leave the emploj ment of capital in that
particular pursuit, and turn for subsistence to some
other occupation But there is a great principle in
continual operation it* society, to wnch the gentle-
man from Mississippi has not adverted, which
sooner or later takes away all option from laboi
It is a proposition, which the wnole histo-y of our
race demonstrates to be true—that population in-
creases faster than production The one gains
continually upon the other, until at length, not
accumulation, but bread, is the sole object of
labor. Hence, as population mcreaces v ages in-
variable decline, until the minimum which can
support life, is attained At this stage, and long
before this stage, a conlest of interest anses be
tween capital and labor The question, how much
of any produ tion shall go to wages, ana how
much to capital, arises nece sarily from their co-
operation, and m determining the share to be re-
ceived by each, capital has the advantage Suppose
one hundred dollars produced by the joint oj ei ation
of capital and labor—who is to determine the just
proportion to wh ch the capí al st and laborer is
entitled1 Why, generally speaki"g, the capitalist,
who sells the commodity and receives the
profits He is far more intelligent and mde
pendent than the laborer, and has the option to em
ploy the laborer or not If he ceases to employ la-
bor, capital may lose its profits, but it labor is not
employed, the laborer may starve Ibeiecanb^
no equality in competition under such circuro
s anees, and with such motives in operation Xne
love of h e is strong r than the love ol gam In
power, in intelligence, in the necessities o e?ch
the capitalist clearly has the advantage cf the la-
borer, and when population become  dense, " id
the means of subsistence scarce the v. ages of la-
bor will then be determined by competition with
itself, and not according to the profits of capital
Hence capital and pauperism may go on increas-
ing rapidly together Where there is the most ca-
pital there may be the most want, as the situation
of the most civilized nations in the world pro-
claims When a man has to work, as in England,
eighteen hours a day for bread, and is woin out in
eight years, and it is io bidden by statute, that <hi'-
dren shall be worked beyond ten houis a day, it is
vain to talk of labor compe ing with oapit 1 C
pital is its master, and tne piolits of c¿p tal w libe
no criterion of wages The laborei wnl oltai i
only the average price of wagts,  w ilho         íy re-
gard to the profits of capital
The great principle relied on b} political econo-
mists, to place laboi on an equaliij oi competition
with capital, is the one to which I have al eady
alluded—the competition of capital with capital
But, if population increases fa ter than cap tal, t
i s clear that the competition of laboi with labor
must be more intense than that of capital with ca-
pital But there are other circurastances -x men
tend to lessen t^e competition of capital, which do
not exist in favor of labor, alwajs unceasing in
its pressure The profits of capital are generallj
concealed, until glaring prosperity points to then
source It is some time, also, before cppital \ e^'ed
in other pursuits can be changed into a more lucra-
tive employment Hence fortunes are alwajs
made, before competition from capital caí les en
profits in any new pursuit of gam, and laoor, dm-
mg these intervals of exemption from competition
by capital, will be employed only at the average
price of labor in other occupations Combinations
of capitalists to keep down wages, are a so moi^
easy than those of labor to advance tnrm, and, m
all such efforts, the laborer must fail, because he
must live Capital cannot starve Nor can the
statute of distribution, on which the gentleman
from Mississippi has so much reli°d for equalizing
the competition of labor and capital, at aU effect
such a result Suppose capital veste I in any par-
ticular pursu t—m manufacture*, ¡or instance—
and it is necessary ta distribute it amongst heirs,
how will this be done' The factory will be sold,
and another proprietor will own it Capital «ill
only change positions It will probably be trans
ferred from stocks or merchandise to an investment
lft fh&factory, and from the factory to stocks The
factory will still go on as before, and the capital it
employs bear th  same relation to labor.    And
what efiect can the statute have, when opeie'mg
immediately on the laborei' Wheie here is pro-
perty, the statute can divide it, but of what avail
i-. it to him who woiks for bread, and not for accj
mula*ion, and who can give nothing to his cbü ren
but life? The statute of distribution cannot tou' h
the question If there is any rel ef to labor, *rom
its unequal competition vith capital, ard its fear-
ful competition with itself, it must be found else-
where Is there any relief Excepting that migfiti-
est and most constant alleviative of suffenrg -nd
competition in labor—den*h—I know but tuo i"-
medies, by which labor can escape from the m<n ■-
table effect of popu'ation overtaking the means of
subsistence, and those are the moial restraint and
emigration The former nfiuence has unfortu-
nately been but fe°ble hitherto m its effects In-

J trust now, Mr Chairman, that I have shown
to oís committee, that capital and labor are not
ah ays identical in mtciests , but, on the contrary,
