Majors Thomas Peters and R. M. Mason, of the quartermaster's department, and Major J. J. Murphy, chief commissary, members of my general staff, I am indebted for their vigilance and activity in the execution of my orders, and the fearlessness with which they exposed themselves in the discharge of their duties.

To my aide-de-camp (Lieutenant W. B. Richmond) I am particularly indebted for the intelligence, decision, and energy with which on this, as on other fields, he gave me his support; also to Lieutenant Colonel Henry C. Yeatman, my volunteer aide, for services of a like character. And our thanks and praise are above all due to Almighty God, the Lord of Hosts, for the success of our arms and the preservation of our lives.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
