Mr KENN EDY of Maryland rose and addre&sed the Commit
tee is Joiiows
Mr Chaikman I aid not believe, until within a few da>s
past, that the gentlemen who have ukene largeol this hilt would
nave again pressed its consideration on th House I thought,
sir, that under the admonition of public sentiment, whit h hasie
ceutly through so many channels been conveyed to the fir of
the Administration, this bub Treasury scheme would be regard
edas a doomed and ioicgont expedient, stamp* d in advance
with the reprob?uon of the country, an i no longer to be entei
tamed in discussion here Ni~ver, in tin histoiy of this Govern
ment, has there been presented a public measure, in le érence
to which the wishes of the constituent body have been more ex
p icitly com numcated to the representative It Ins bfen can
vassedby the people v ith a scrupulous dehbeiation, it has been
mv eatigated by them with all that care which apamlul sense of
present evil could suggest, and they have expiessed their dis
approbation of it in every form m which they were able to find
a voue I did net suopose that with the principles by which
the friends ofthe Adrmmsti ation in this body aiiect to b* go
verned, they couid have brought t lemselves so far to resist tfiat
voice as again to propose the bill I thought indeed, sir, that
the late action of Congress, in the almtst unanimous and even
eag^r repeal oí the Treasury order of July, 1838, woui I he con
struedasa decisive sentence against this measure T canno*
un lersLaiid how that repeal and this bill may consist with each
Other, and I should be glad to hear some intelligible reconule
mentoftue two It is true that the joint resolution to which T
refer, does not in expresa terina íepealthe Treasury Circular,
but itaccomphshes the same end, quite as eflecuaily by (or
hi Idmg the secretary to discriminate m the moneys he íeueives
for pubhedues, and as hehaskmd'y volunteeied to say that he
will not refuse good bank paper for the customs, held no "ong^r
at liberty to refuse it for pubhc lands, and so we havt, m fact
repealed that noxious Treasury order which has so long an
noyed the country
That order being out of the way, I would ask to what ele
menta may alt this machinery ofthe Sub Treasury apply? Is
it necessary to build vaults, and construct safes, and create all
the agencies designated in this bill to guaid a Jew rolls of
bank paper? The apparatus of this scheme essentially belongs
to the gold and silver reign, it deals only in com, aod has us
existence and daily continuance m he phi ttasmagoriio'' the
hard money system Ihe moment you abandon the absolute
coined metal, your Treasury system becomes a s>s cm olere
dit in account, impalpable to the guardianship of stone and
iron, unamenable to lock and key, it rtsts upon the (er->onal
fiuelty and integitt/ oi your agents How shall the details ei
thrs bill apply to it?
Mr Chan man, I especially legre' that this bill has been
brought forward at Urn  time, because 1 know that a mist
happy conviction began to gain ground with the p iblic, that
it was now the purpose ofthe Adm initiation to bring itse'f
waiun the range ol tie b isiness *ud wvnts of the con ran
nuy, to uke a uo«ition n which it m'ght sj mpath z with
the people, and, n not actually extend us aid, at least abandon
Us nrhf ren~e to their distresses, mat it meant now to gire
up its wat against the cunen y to CtL.taeiJeiiscxpciimt-rtts,

with the lights of past expedience, ta the actual need of the

catana svstem upon the couatryl
The aeil with which the bill i* urged leaves no room to
doubt the am«ere deajrc of \ts projectors to carry it into effect,
and 1 have heaid that its friends entertain hopes of its pa

standing the general revolt of the na*ion, the banner C" the
Administration torn as it has been in recent conflict", is still
upheld by men bold enough to dely the almost universal
popular voice That struggle will yield but a worthless tn
umph, who->e greatest success can have no better end than to
continue, ior ¿"brief space, the oppressions of a power against
which public judgment is accumulating its censure, with
fiesh and fctill fresher indignation, aud which issureh doom
ed to he prostrated by those overwhelming bursts of indig-
nation of which the Adminis ration have already had a fore
taste
Mr Chairman, this bill assumes to he remedial in its charac
t?r Itanse&outof a suggestion of the President, made at a
time whenhehad calledCon^ress together to deliberate upon a
gieat national convulsion, which tod broughtdisa^ter into ever)
ciass of society It ma> be said to have been the onlv tepic of
consideration at that moment it was the only relief propose t
Although the afflictions of that day a«-e passing away stul they
are > et seveiely felt, and this measure is again presented, as at
first i1 wa^ asa measure of lehef In that view I mea i to di&.
cu=.s it, and to test us adequacy to its proposed object, by call ng
tl * attention of the committee to the origin and nature oí tnt-
evils which itisdes'gned to remedy
p>ir I was somewhat curious to know upon what grounds it
would be advocated here as a measure of iclief, and 1 hav^
theieforelister °d to the debate with eager attention On o •>

Indued from his n. narks upon tint, bil1 he ha=! persuaded him

of these motley opnnoned deienders of the scheme can hive

s^nts it I would ad\ lse the to ntiemen from the^outhto pame
and lank about them, lest they make a fatal mtnake mtlKir
method of pulling down the city of New York md budding up
Charleston   And to say the uudi I think thtre is reason to
fear tnat the henorab1  chairman of the <: «mmitíee of Wa\s
and Means is no* altogether wron^in bis expeciotmrci "With
that unscrupulous lavonpstn by which this and the last admi-
nistration have been accustomed io. execute the laws, New
York, provided she de mean herself less contumaciously than
she. has lat&ly done, may tarn her «.political acquiescence to
some account under this proposed system There is power in
it, as I shall hereafter snow, for the conferring of any amount
of favor But it h. very clear that the gentlemen of the South
do not, m any one point, agree m the conclusions, or give credrt
'o the wisdom of the honoiable chairman
If the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr Pickens] be
right in his estimate of the character and tendency oí this bilk
then I warn the represemativf s of the N mh to look to it They
are not hard money men—*hey úo not wish to strangle tho
h inking system—above all, I presume they do not wish to
check the commerce or restrain the industry of their own regí jn
If they do, let them follow the lead of the member from South
Carolina, and when they go home to their constituents, ie'
> ne n say that they have been converted to a conviction of the
soundness of his views, and thei cfore vo ed f< r the bill
Mr Chaiman, I am not unfiiendly to the p-uspenty of South
Carolina No man on this door wi&hes her well more heartily
than Ido, and look with a proiourd giatification to that roble
and wise spun of cnua prise which has lately prompted her to
stdle die Alleghany with hei great road God speed her in that
¡Jorums rivalry by which she has been endeavored to place
heiseif on a commanding eminence amongst the States! There
nee her path to wealth, power and haj piness, let he1* puisue it
steadily, and she will reap hei íeward None will exult m it
moie thm> m>sell Bit when she aims at breaking up the
commercial union of the North and South, and especially when
she teaches her people that this Government has been unkind
to th* bomb eh  e;iveB a danaerousdirection n their thnugl ts
A fancy of discon ent is quite as stimulating as a real cause,
and may teach the weaker gifted m the gifts of head and heart
the mischievous habí of talc dating the value of our Union
Whether design d or not, these preachings ot discontent tenl
towards that horrible catastrophe of disunion, with tb* c mtetr
plation of which I would not have uürpeople familiar It if m
the very bounty of the Almighty that our North and South are
united in those beautiful bonds of brotherhood whi h their
mutual commerce with eachother have created, it will be the
re-iet ot this whole continent when independent, circles of
tiade shall U foimed which shall leave the different geogra
phical sections of the countrv no lenger useful toeaeh oihei m
their dealings    Sir it will lead irresistibly to separation
I would hope, ^r that these thou<*lns,or any thought kmdied
to them, never entered the mind of the gentleman from South
Carolina in his support of this bill, and that, after all, he has
been harmlessly uenhng in the dogmas of that rev, philosophy
vhidi h is of late become so peculiarly the p> oduct of his own
«Hate South Carolina has f ra time gone in p imut of^tnnge
