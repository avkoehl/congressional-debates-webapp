loss in killed and wounded had been very heavy. General Grant estimates his own total loss in the campaign at 10,000 killed, wounded, and missing. Of prominent officers, Brigadier-General Read is the only one of our killed since the pursuit began. Lee surrendered some 12,000 animals, all in very poor condition. As an additional favor General Grant has allowed all private soldiers of Lee's who owned their horses to take them home. Lee says we can march without difficulty any-where through the South, and it may be necessary, but he hopes not. Johnston, he thinks, has not now more than from 5,000 to 10,000 efficient men. He has sent to Johnston advising him to given up. Where Jeff. Davis is he does not know, be thinks he may be in Danville. Breckinridge started for Lynchburg, since which he has not been heard of. Benjamin and Trenholm are supposed to be with Jeff. Davis, who is also thought to have with him to specie taken from Richmond. The whereabouts of Extra Billy is unknown.

I have prepared a long cipher dispatch,* with all the facts I have been able to gather. General Grant is going to Washington to-day, and unless I receive contrary orders I propose to go with him. Mrs. General Lee is dying, and her husband and Custin Lee have been sent for to go to her.
