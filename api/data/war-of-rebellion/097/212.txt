HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, ARMY OF THE JAMES, In the Field, March 27, 1865.

General WEITZEL,Commanding Twenty-fifth Corps:

GENERAL: If an evacuation occurs in my absence look out for torpedoes and mines. It is now reported that large numbers of the former are put down on Chaffin's farm and Bermuda front. Don't let your columns take the roads; keep them in the woods and bypaths. Send cattle and old horses up the roads first. To-night and to-morrow keep camp-firs going as usual in empty camps, and the usual picket on. Make as little change as possible at conspicuous points. If you can do so, cover the prominent part of the vacated camps with shelter-tents for a day or two, or old newspaper; go on with drills and parades in sight as usual. Adams' fifth Massachusetts Colored Cavalry is on its way to Deep Bottom; may arrive to-morrow or day after. Better camp them near where Mackenzie's outside camps were. It is very full. Besides this, I leave 500 of Mackenzie's division, commanding officer to report to you. Birney's division will move very quietly soon as it is dark; cross at Aiken's, thence cross at Broadway, behind Turner; both put wagons in front.

Yours, &amp;c.,

E. O. C. ORD.
