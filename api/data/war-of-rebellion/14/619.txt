
RICHMOND, VA., June 26, 1862.

Brigadier General J. G. WALKER,

Drewry's Bluff, Va.:

Since my telegram to you I have received a telegram from General Holmes, announcing that the enemy are landing at Bermuda Hundred. Suspend the execution of my order until you learn the character of this movement. Unless the landing is in force, you may still re-enforce General Huger, who will probably need it.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

DREWRY'S BLUFF, VA., June 26, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

I have received your three telegrams. Instead of the enemy's landing at Bermuda Hundred, his gunboats and transports have gone up the Appomattox. I shall put my command en route to join General Huger at once.

J. G. WALKER,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, VA., June 26, 1862.

Major General T. H. HOLMES, Petersburg, Va.:

The battle is progressing and we need all the re-enforcements we can get. I have ordered General Walker to leave one regiment at Drewry's Bluff, and to join General Huger on the Williamsburg road with the rest of his command. Move with all your available force. If you think Drewry's Bluff needs re-enforcing send troops there, and either come here with the rest or cross at the pontoon bridge and join our right, informing General Huger of your approach. Let me know which route you take.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
