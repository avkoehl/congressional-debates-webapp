Major-General BIRNEY,

Tenth Corps:

Your dispatch received. General Butler desires to get a prisoners or deserter from your front as soon as possible to ascertain what is going on. He directs that you immediately instruct your picket-lines that he will give any of our men a thirty days' furlough who will, in the course of the day, bring in a line rebel soldier, either as a prisoner or by inducing one to desert. Have them sent on direct if any are obtained.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

The commanding general directs me to inform you that Lieutenant-General Grant has directed all the troops on the north side of James River, excepting Foster's command, to withdraw after dark to-day. The navy has been requested to assist Foster all they can to hold his old position. Lieutenant-General Grant says with regard to Foster as follows:

General Foster, I think, had better level the line of rifle-pits we captured from the enemy and hold his old position if possible. The lower pontoon bridge should also be swung round to the west bank of the river. It may be advisable for General foster to move his teams and surplus property to the west bank.
