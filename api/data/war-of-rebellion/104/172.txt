The Cavalry Corps will resume the pursuit of the enemy to-morrow in the following order:

I. The Second Division will move at 5.30 a. m. by the direct Selma road. Unless Colonel Minty's brigade can reach this place by 7 a. m . to-morrow, General Long will begin his advance with his other brigade.

II. The Fourth Division will follow the Second Division.

III. Should the enemy show a front requiring more than one division to drive him from his position, General Long will move his division to the right of the Selma road in order to allow the Fourth Division to form on his left. As the corps approaches the city General Long will incline toward the Summerfield road, and both divisions will, if practicable, march in columns of brigade.

HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Selma Road, April 1, 1865.

[Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps:]

GENERAL: Order the battalion that goes to Centerville to hold the bridge at that place, as the rebel force under Adams will probably attempt to join their main force on this road by that route. General Croxton camped three miles from Trion last night, and the rebels under Adams a few miles from him. Direct the commanding officer of the battalion to endeavor to communicate with General Croxton and let him know where we are. There is a rebel force at Centerville now, and it should be surprised, if possible.

By command of Brevet Major-General Wilson:

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
