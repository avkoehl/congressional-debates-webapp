The following dispatch is sent for information of the major-general commanding:

SIGNAL STATION OF OBSERVATION,

In front of the left of the Tenth Army Corps Line, October 17, 1864-7 p. m.

Lieutenant WILLIAM P. SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Signal officer at the above station reports the enemy active in strengthening and increasing the number of their line s of defense. Wagons loaded with timber are continually moving to a formidable-looking work located to our left of Fort Johnson. New breast-works have been thrown up in the rear of Fort Johnson and fronting toward James River. An embrasure has been cut in the traverse on the right in Fort Johnson, and a stockade for sharpshooters is also being erected in that work. Another line of abatis has been made, running out from this fort at about an angle of 45 degrees from a general line of their works in our front. One gun visible at Fort Gilmer. A battery of four pieces, four horses to each piece, came down New Market road at 2 p. m. and took position behind the new breast-work near the road. The line of fire of these pieces in their present position is a flanking one. About 200 negroes have been at work all day on the line of breast-work running from Fort Gilmer to new Market road. Three six-horse and three four-horse wagons with infantry guard from Richmond to our left, via the New Market road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

PAUL BRODIE,

First Lieutenant, Signal Corps.

Does Brodie's dispatch indicate to you anything more than that the rebels are strengthening their position in you front?

Major-General WEITZEL:

Nothing more than that. For several nights past he has made reports of what has been seen from the station, and I have forwarded them whether they seemed to me important or unimportant.
