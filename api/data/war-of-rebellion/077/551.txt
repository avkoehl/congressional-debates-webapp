Numbers 2. Report of Major Mindret Wemple, Fourth Illinois Cavalry.
HDQRS. FOURTH Illinois CAVALRY VOLUNTEERS,Natchez, Miss., September 23, 1864.

SIR: In obedience to orders I took command of detachments of Fourth Illinois Cavalry Twenty-eighth Illinois Infantry, Twenty- ninth Illinois Infantry, Sixth U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery, and Seventy-first U. S. Colored Infantry, on the morning of the 22nd instant, and proceeded to the plantation of Mr. A. K. Farrar. I placed all the infantry and the detachment from the Sixth U. S. Heavy Artillery in quartermaster's wagons, which enabled me to arrive at Farrar's at 11 a. m. I loaded 51 wagons with corn and cotton, brought in 47 bales of cotton and 143 head of cattle. The enemy engaged our rear guard soon after leaving Farrar's and kept up a lively skirmish for six miles. I had not one hurt. One man of the enemy was shot from his horse, supposed to have been killed. Returned to Natchez last night at 11 o'clock.

Very respectfully,

M. WEMPLE,

Major, Commanding Fourth Illinois Cavalry.
