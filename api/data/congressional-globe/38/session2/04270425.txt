â€¢1865.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I only rose to reply to that single remark of
the gentleman from Vermont, and I will say in
closing, as I said at the commencement, that the
power to enforce this law when once enacted is
just as ample as the power to enforce any other
law.
Mr. COX resumed the floor.
Mr. GRINNELL. Will the gentleman give
way for a motion to adjourn?
Mr. COX. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. GRINNELL. Inasmuch as the Cabinet
are not expected here this evening, i move that
the House do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and thereupon (at
four minutes to four o'clock, p. m.) the House
adjourned.

BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. MORRILL asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
411) to amend an act entitled "An act to incor-
porate the Metropolitan Railroad Company in the
District of Columbia:" which was read twice by
its title, and referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia.
REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mr, CHANDLER, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the petition of
light-house keepers in Narragansett bay, pray-
ing for an increase of salary, reported adversely
thereon, the committee deeming it inexpedient at
this time to increase official salaries.
Mr. COLLAMER. The Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads, to whom was referred a
bill (S. No. 392) supplementary to an act ap-
proved July 14, 1862, entitled "An act to estab-
lish certain post roads," have directed me to re-
poit it back with amendments. The amendments
are merely verbal, and need not be printed.
Mi. POWELL. I move to take up the bill
just reported by the Senator from Vermont. It
is a matter of very deep interest to the commu-
nity generally to nave the railway completed to
which the bill refers. '
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Kentucky asks the unanimous consent of thd
Senate to proceed to the consideration of the kill
just reported by the Senator from Vermont.
there any objection?
Mr, COWAN. I object. I want to read the
bill first, and see what it is.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made, the bill must go over under the rules.
BENJAMIN VREELAND.
Mr. ANTHONY. I am instructed by the
Committee on Naval Affairs, to whom was re-
ferred the petition of Benjamin Vreeland, pray-
ing to be allowed the difference of compensation
between the pay of an assistant surgeon and that
of passed assistant surgeon from the date when
he was entitled to his examination by law to the
date of his passing Jiis examination, to report a
bill for his relief. It is a very small matter, and,
I ask for the present consideration of the bill.
By unanimous consent, the bill (S. No. 412) for
the relief of Benjamin Vreeland, surgeon m the
Navy of the United States, was read twice and
considered as in Committee of the Whole. It
provides for the payment of $449 07, being the
difference between the compensation of an assist-
ant surgeon and a passed assistant surgeon from
May 9, 1855, to March 30, 1857.
Mr. HALE. Is there a report in that case?
Mr. MORRILL. I believe the bill touches the
general question of increasing salaries, against
which the Senate has expressed itselfso strongly.
Mr. ANTHONY. No, sir. I will explain the
case. There is no written report. AssistantSur-
geon Vreeland was ordered to sea about the time
when he was entitled to an examination for pro-
motion. At the time when all the other assistant
surgeons of the same date were examined, he was
at sea and could not be examined. As soon as
he returned he was examined, and the board of
examiners testified that he would have passed the
examination at the time when he was entitled by
law to receive it, but being absent at seahecould
not appear before the board. This bill is to allow
him the pay for the advanced grade between the
time when he ought to have been examined and
the lime when he was examined. It is in strict
accordance with precedent. As these cases have
arisen occasionally,agenerallawhas been passed
covering them, but the law was not retroactive
and did not reach his case.
Mr. MORRILL. It is a gratuity.
Mr. HALE. I do not know anything about
the law referred to by the Senator from Rhode
Island, but I know that 1 have had such cases as
this and the Senate has refused to pay them. The
case of young Dr. Suddards, of Philadelphia, I
recollect, precisely similar to this, and the Senate
refused to make the allowance, i wish that the
bill may lie over until to-morrow, so that I may
look into that law.
Mr. ANTHONY. I have no objection to that.
I am suie that if the Senator examines the case
he will find that the bill is according to precedent,
and that there is a general law now covering such
cases.
The bill was postponed until to-morrow.
COMMITTEE ON BANKS.
Mr. GRIMES submitted the following resolu-
tion; which lies over under the rule:
Headed, That there beaddud to the standinpeommiuees
of the Senate a Committee mi Hanks and Banking Institu-
tions, to consist of seven members.
WAYS AND MEANS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Finance, to whom was referred the bill
(H. R. No. 677) to amend an act entitled "An
act to provide ways and means for the support of
the Government, and for other purposes," ap-
proved June 30, 18G4, to report it back without
amendment, and I ask for its present consider-
ation.
By unanimous consent, the bill was considered
as in Committee of the Whole. It provides that in
lieu of any bonds authorized to be issued by the
fhst section of the act of June 30,1864, that may
remain unsold at the date of this act, the Secre-
tary of the Treasury may issue, under the au-
