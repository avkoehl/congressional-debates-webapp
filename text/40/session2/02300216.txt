[t. s.] and in tho twenty-third year of the inde-
pendence of the United States.
JOHN ADAMS,
By command of the President of tho United States
of America:
JAMBS MoIIENPvY, Secretary of War.
Mr. CUHTIS. I now desire, Mr. Chief
Justice, to putin a document from the Depart-
ment of the Interior,, showing the removals of
superintendents of Indian afjairs, and of In-
dian agents, of land officers, receivers of. pub-
lic moneys, surveyors general, and certain mis-
cellaneous officers w,ho are not brought under
any one of those classes. The document which
I hold shows the date pf the removal, the
iiame of the officer, the office he held, and also
contains a memorandum whether the removal
was during the recess of the Senate or in the
session of the Senate.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I have but one
objection to this species of evidence without
anybody brought here to testify to it, and that
is this: I have learned that in the case of
the Treasury Department, which I allowed to
come in without objection, there were other
cases not reported where' the power was re-
fused to be exercised. I do not know whether
it is so in the Interior Department or not. But
most of these cases, upon our examination,
appear to be simply under the law fixing their
tenure during the pleasure of the President for
the time being, and some of them are inferior
officers originally made appointable by the
heads of Departments. If the presiding, officer
thinks they have any bearing we have no objec-
tion.
Mr. CURTIS. I understand the matter of
the application of the law to these offices some-
what differently from that which is stated by
the honorable Manager. I have not had an
opportunity minutely to examine these lists,
for they were only handed to me this morning;
but I understand that a very large number of
thesj officers held for a fixed tenure of four
years. That., however, must be a matter o£,
argument hereafter.
Mr. Manager" BUTLER. What class of offi-
cers do you speak of?
Mr. CURTIS. Receivers of public moneys
is one of the classes.
Mr. JOHNSON. "What is the date of tho
first removal and of the last?
Mr. CURTIS. These tables, I think, ex-
tend through the whole period of the existence
of that Department. I do not remember the
date when- the Department was established,
but I think they run through the whole history
of the Department.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. So objection is
made to the reception of this document in evi-
dence.
The document is as follows:
Department of tub Isteeioe,
Washington, D. C., .April ]7,1808.
I, Orvillo II. Browning, Secretary of flic Interior, do
hereby certify that tho annexed thirteen sheets eon-
tain full, true, complete, and perfect transcripts from
tho records of this Department, so far as the same
relate to the removals from oifiee of the persons therein
named.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto subscribed
my name and caused the seal of the Depart-
[l. s.] ment to bo affixed the day and year above
written. 0. II. BROWNING,
Secretary of the Interior.
