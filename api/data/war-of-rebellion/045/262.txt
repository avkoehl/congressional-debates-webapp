carre of it from Washington to Annapolis Junction, and I from that point to Baltimore. I have now Company A, Purnell (Maryland) Cavalry, at Annapolis Junction, 74 strong, belonging to General Lockwood's command. They will, perhaps, not be needed on the road, and I do need them here. You will proceed immediately to Washington, see General Heintzelman, and agree with him as to stations, patrols, &amp;c., that may be considered necessary, and make report to these headquarters.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your orders as to the Northern Central Railroad are being carried out. I have now two companies of Pennsylvania and four of Maryland infantry stationed between here and the State line, and I have an engineer officer with the troops, and railroad operatives at work at the block-houses and palisades. By the help of Lockwood's command, I have, up to this time, besides the increased railroad guards, two regiments and seven companies of infantry and two companies of artillery outside the forts. With new levies added here from the North, I could best defend by advancing, in conjunction with General Couch, against the enemy.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have now a company of Purnell (Maryland) Cavalry (74 strong) assembled at Annapolis Junction. I need them here, unless you require them to be added as patrols to the infantry guards on the railroad from Pennsylvania this way. Here I would throw them out as scouts toward Frederick and Westminster.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
