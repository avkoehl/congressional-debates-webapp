The petition is as follows :
The memorial of Victoria G. Woodhuil, to the hon-
orable the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States in Congress assembled, respect-
fully showeth:
That she was born in tho State of Ohio, and is
above the age of twenty-one years; that she has re-
sided in the State of New York during the past three
years; that she is still a resident thereof, and that
ahÂ© is a citizen of the United States as declared by
the fourteenth article of amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States; that since the adop-
tion of the fifteenth article of amendments to the
Constitution neither theState of New York, nor any
other State, nor any Territory, has passed any law
to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the Uni-
ted States to vote, ad established by the said article,
neither on account of sex or otherwise; that never-
theless the right to vote is denied to women citizens
of tho United States by the operation of election
laws in the several States and Territories which
were cnaeted prior to the adoption of the said four-
teenth and fifteenth articles, and which are incon-
sistent with the Constitution, ai amended by them,
and therefore the said laws are void and of no eii'e.ct,
but which, being still enforced by the said States
and Territories, render the Constitution inoperative
as regards the right of women citizens to vote ; and
wheieas article six, section two, declares "that
this Constitution and the laws of the United States
which fchall bo made in pursuance thereof, and all
treaties made and which shall be made under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
law of the land; and the judges in every State shall
bo bound thereby, anything m the constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstand-
ing-;" and whereas no distinction between citizens
is made m the Constitution ot the United States on
account of sex. but as the fourteenth article of
amendments to it provides that "no Stale shall
make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States;" " nor deny to any person within its jurisdic-
tiontheeciual protection of the laws;" and whereas
Congress has power "to make laws which shall be
necessary and proper for carrying into execution all
powers vested by the Constitution in the Govern-
ment of tho United States," and to make or alter
all regulations in regard to the times and manner of
holding elections for Senators and Representatives,
and especially to enforce by appropriate legislation
the provisions of the said fourteenth article; and
whereas the continuance of tho enforcement of said
local election laws denying and abridging the right
of citizens to vote on account of sex is a grievance to
your memorialist and to various other citizens uf the
United States being women: therefore, your me-
morialist wouid.respectfully petition your honorable
bodies to make such law as in the wisdom of Con-
gress shall bo necessary and proper lor carrying into
execution the right vested by the Constitution in
the citizens of the United States to vote without
icgard to sex.
And your memoralist will ever pray.
