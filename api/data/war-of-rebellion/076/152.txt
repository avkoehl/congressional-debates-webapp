HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I am about moving camp to vicinity of Powers', and will visit Generals Howard and Schofield, where I can be found in case of necessity. I can't imagine what cavalry it is that General Granger reports at Claysville. What is the gun-boat about? It should be at Guntersville at once. If Johnston has ordered this movement he will not care about Huntsville or Decatur, but Stevenson and Bridgeport. The latter is of vital importance and he knows it.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 16, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I cannot conceive what cavalry Granger refers to. The gun-boat has been out of my charge for more than two weeks. Granger ought to have cavalry enough left from Rousseau's expedition to whip all the cavalry the enemy can send across the Tennessee.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

Major-General, Commanding.

JULY 16, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

Have heard nothing further from rebel cavalry. Am all ready and will move in the morning across Pace's Ferry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
