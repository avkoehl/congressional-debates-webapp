THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

the Senate with amendments, and the Senate
litis had no opportunity to vote on those amend-
ments. la it not premature to ask a confer-
ence ?
Mr. DAWES. Oh no ; if they choose they
can decline to appoint a committee of confer-
ence.
Mr. FAliNSWQBTII. I think it would
have been better to await the action of the
Senate before asking a committee of coufer-
Tiie SPEAKER. The Chair will remark
that in cases involving so many points of dif-
ference between the two Houses as in the
appropriation bill just passed the Chair would
deem it to be his duty to appoint a committee
of conference with reference to what may be
called the leading points, those involving the
heaviest appropriations; and as in this case those
points appear to bo the appropriations for the
new State Department and for the extension
of the Capitol grounds, involving $1,000,000,
the Choir will appoint a committee on the
basis of that difference, selecting gentlemen
who represent the House upon those questions.
The Chair announces the following as the com-
mittee of conference on the part of the House :
Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts, Mr. Niblack
of Indiana, and Mr. Logax of Illinois.
SCHOONER SIBYL.
On motion of Mr. DAWES, by unanimous
consent, the bill (S. No. 88) to carry into effect
a decree of the district court of the United
States for the southern district of New \ork
in the ease of the English schooner Sibyl and
her cargo was taken from the Speaker'â€¢> table,
read alirst and second time, and referred to
the Committee on Appropriations.
SClIOONKlt FLYING scud.
On motion of Mr. DAWES, also by unani-
mous consent, the bill (S. No. 80) to carry into
effect a decree of the district court of the Uni-
ted States for the district of Louisiana in the
case of the British schooner Flying Scud and
her cargo was taken from the Speaker's table,
read a first and second time, and refeired to
the Committee on Appropriations.
JUNCTION' AND MIEAKWAMR JlAILliOAD.
On motion of Mr. BECK, by unanimous con-
sent, the bill (S. No. 888) to aid the Junction
and Breakwater Railroad Companym theState
of Delaware to construct, in connection with
said road, a pier in the Delaware bay, at or
near Lewes, in Sussex county, and State of
Delaware, was taken from the Speaker s table,
read a first and second time, and referred to
the Committee on Appropriations.
POLICE COURT FOlt DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Mr. COOK. I ask unanimous consent to
have a correction made in the report of the
committee of conference on the disagreeing
votes of the two Houses in relation to the
police court bill for the District of Columbia.
It is a mere clerical error. In line eighteen
of section seventeen, after the word ' "ls>' "ie
word.-, "cleric hire, not exceeding $1,200 per
annum," were accidentally omitted. 1 desire
unanimous consent that the error may be cor-
rected. .
There was no objection; and n was so
ordered.
army bill.
Mr. LOGAN. I submit a privileged report
from a committee of conference on the Army
bill, which 1 ask may be now read.
The Clerk began the reading, but before ho
had concluded, ,
Mv. ELDRIDGE sa:d : Would it not a.nswei
the nurpose of the gentleman from Illinois
[Mr' Looan] just as well to have this report
unii'ed, and let it go o-er till Monday next?
Mr LO&AN. This subject nas already been
fuflv discussed here. There is notasohtaiy
provision in tins report that has not tic-en
before the House and tne country for tore.)
months; not one. There are one or two sec-
tions stricken out of the House bill, and some
few sections of the Senate bill added.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Iam inclined to think
it would facilitate the passage of this bill to
take the course I have indicated. It is now j
late, nearly four o'clock. i
Mr. LOGAN 1 know that; but there are
certain reasons why I desire to ha.ve this report
acted on to-day. I expect to leave this city
on Monday ; I do not know that I shall do so,
but I wish to do so if I can.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I would suggest that
the gentleman explain briefly the effect of the
report, instead of having it read.
Mr. LOGAN. I will explain it if necessary ;
but it will not take ten minutes to complete the
reading of it.
Mr. ALLISON. I hope the gentleman will
explain it; it, looks like a long report.
Air. ELDRIDGE. The House bill provided
for an Army of twenty-five thousand men ; the
Senate bill, for an Army of thirty thousand. I
would like to ask the gentleman 
Mr. LOGAN. I can tell the gentleman, with-
out further inquiry, that, he is mistaken. JTie
House bill did riot provide anything at all about
the number of men in the Army.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. The effect of the House
bill was to provide for an Army of twenty-five
thousand men.
Mr. LOGAN. Not at all; that is a mistake.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Then it is a very general
mistake.
Mr. PAINE. I hope the report will be read.
Mr. LOGAN, it will not take long to com-
plete the reading of the report.
The. Clerk resumed and concluded the read-
ing of the report, which was as follows:
