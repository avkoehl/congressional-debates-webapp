The instructions conveyed in your letter of the 7th instant to General Beauregard, and reiterated in your telegram of to-day to me, shall be carried out, but the enemy is now making threatening demonstrations near the batteries manned by some of the companies named, and I beg that I may be allowed to retain them as they are for a few days and until I can communicate with you more fully on the subject.

Two regiments of Wise's brigade have started for Richmond; the remainder will leave to-morrow. Colquitt's brigade will follow without delay. None of the troops ordered to me from General Johnson's army have arrived. I have only two regiments and one weak battalion, including Colonel Keitt's, on Sullivan's Island. No infantry on James Island, but one regiment of infantry between here and Savannah;there one regiment and two battalions, thirteen companies of department. The two cavalry regiments ordered from Virginia are not yet for duty. I will make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances, but if it be possible send me a few more regiments.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

General Anderson telegraphs me that another of the enemy's steamers was blown into fragments yesterday by a torpedo in the Saint John's, a short distance below Jacksonville. She had two guns aboard, and was towing a schooner. The latter escaped. Not known how many lives lost. This is the third steamer that has met this fate in the Saint John's within the last forty days.

Your dispatch of to-day received. I have ordered General Anderson to form the whole of this infantry into one brigade, and send it to Richmond with the greatest possible dispatch, Brigadier-General Finegan commanding. The brigades will be small, and formed of battalions and unattached companies, but it is all I have in that
