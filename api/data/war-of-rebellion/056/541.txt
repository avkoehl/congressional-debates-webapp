Brigadier General B. H. GRIERSON,.

La Grange, Tennessee:

Stevenson telegraphs that Lee has moved west from Okolona. If the enemy go down toward Panola, they will soon be out of reach. You will, in that case, secure a crossing on Coldwater, and retire your force across that stream in the direction of Collierville. After crossing let a force of a regiment or two sweep down Coldwater and back to Memphis.

Major-General.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Two of the scouts that went to Jackson with dispatches for General Smith have just returned; had a hard time; were captured twice-the last time at Jackson. They found a rebel force of about 300 in Jackson, by whom they were taken prisoners. They made their escape from them night before last. They heard nothing from Smith.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS,

Commanding Cavalry in North Mississippi:

SIR: I forward by flag of truce two letters, one for yourself from the widow of President Polk. I hope you will be able to grant her request. She has a safeguard for her plantation and crops from the officers of the United States. If her cotton can be allowed to come up, I will see that it is forwarded for her benefit. The other letter is for the Honorable H. S. Foote. The contents I am assured are private. As such I have passed it, without inspection. Major D. J. Benner, my aide, with an escort of 15 men and 2 officers, will bear this to your outposts, or until he can find an officer who will receipt for it.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
