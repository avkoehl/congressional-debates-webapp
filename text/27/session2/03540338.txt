piy the deficiency Sir, said Mr G the gentleman speaks
by amhouty, he is more than the leader of the party for
he is the minister of peace, by whose aid the broken fragments
of the Whi¿ ptrty are to be cemented jiog ther He avows as
the true policy, tha the Government should be earned on to
the tune of twen'v six millions annually, as proclaimed by the
gee it champion <>f Whi^eryin the other end of the Capitol It
la ft>r4this, said Mr G that Í hold the great Whig party resp m
sible Twer ty two millions, said Mr G annually for ordinary
exdenses, and two millions annually for contingencies He
would ask the gentleman what his gieat leader meant bv pro
viding two millions for contingencies Was it for the necessary
expenditures of the Government, or was Uto be kepi as a parse
of small change to buy up political capital, and beep the Wing
parly in power?
Hi GKINTRV here interrupted Mr G. and asked if the
Senatm from Kentucky in the resolution to which the gentle
man referred, was not that two millions only weie tobe re
served a* i contingent fund and not accumulated annually
Mr GOtOON said he would satisfy the gpntleman by read
ing the re^ol ution itself    It was as> follows
"Ue^olvcd therefoie, That the rate of duties on foreign im
porte ought to be aug nented beyonl the nte of twemy per
cent so as to produce a nett revenue of twenty six mllionsof
dollars —twenty two for the ordinary expenses of Government,
two for the payment of the existing debt, and two millions as a
re&erved fund foi contingencies "
Here, said Mr ^G the resolution boldly avow in the face
of all the promisee of this great Whig party made before
coming into powet, thaf the duties on ¡oreign impoits ought to
be augmented beyond twenty Dar tent so as to produce a nett
levenue ot twenty six millions of dollars, twenty two of which
were lor til ordinary expenses of the Government, and two
millions for contingencies, and two millions foi the existing
debt But to put the mittei beyond a doubt, he would £ivo the
gentleman's own meaning of hi  resolution as explained by
himself Here "Mi G iead fiom the debates m the Senate as
follows
"Mr Clay explained He said he might have passed this
point, and probably did, without sufficiently explaining his
views He did not intend these two millions as a i reasury ba
lance simply, but also to meet the contingencies of legislation,
of appropriations beyond the estimates and the established
means "
i he gentleman from Massachusetts [Mi Saiionstall] took
thegtounu that the credit of the Government was noum paired,
thai H stood a  fair as it ever did, but that the times weie out oí
punt Now, he had supposed, from the lamentations of the
Whig party ami the lamentatioi s that came from the Treasury
Hepaument, that the fmancesol ihe Government weie out of
