venient place, to be returned when about to leave the ship. Soldiers from seasickness, want of use to he motion of the ship, are unable to take care of their arms, which might be damaged without the possibility of their preventing it.

When a steam vessel comes alongside of a wharf or other vessel care should be taken that the gangs boards are properly fixed and attended by seamen before the troops are allowed to step on them, and they ought to be made to march with regularity.

The senior officer in command of troops on board should cause a careful inspection to be made twice a day relative to their condition, and if any symptoms of a contagious disease should appear among the men, they should be immediately separated from their comrades until the character of the disease is known.

While a well-regulated ship is remarkable for health, one where proper precautions are not observed soon becomes a floating pest- house. A steamer for the transportation of troops should be well provided with boats ready to lower away at a moment's notice. She should be fitted with sufficient life buoys, ready to be shipped or cast away if a person should fall overboard.

The troops on board should on no account be allowed to interfere with the management of the ship, and arrangements should be made in case of accidents to prevent a rush to the boats.

If a boat is to be lowered, it should be done by the people of the ship, and not by soldiers unaccustomed to that kind of service, which often causes loss of life.

The commanding officer on board should only under extraordinary circumstances oblige the captain to put to sea, or cross a dangerous bar, to go into port, if the captain should protest against it as incurring risk of life and property. For the more particular guidance of quartermasters in charge of transportation I would refer to the excellent instructions embodied in the Revised Army Regulations of the War Department, page 20, article 37.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WISE,

Colonel, in Charge Ocean and Lake Transportation.
