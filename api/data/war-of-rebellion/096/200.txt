from outside that guerrilla bands intend to make a strong effort to capture the public animals at Burke's Station and vicinity. I notified Colonel Albricht to strengthen his guards, there, especially at night, and be ready to meet them.

General Sheridan says if the stables at Monrovia are needed he does not wish them torn down. You will, therefore, not permit them to be torn down.

U. S. MONITOR ONONDAGA,

Aiken's Landing, James River, Va., January 22, 1865.

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 21st instant, conveying the information that an order was issued on Tuesday last that the rebel fleet should come down the river, either pass or attack the monitors, and attempt the destruction of City Point.

I thank you very much for this information, and I shall exercise more than usual vigilance to defeat any plan the rebels may have in contemplation on the river. In this connection I would beg leave to suggest that the flag-of-truce boat be not allowed to come above the pontoon bridge to land prisoners, as I consider it highly objectionable for the rebels to have a close view of our monitors or our method of drill or exercise. Deep Bottom is a convenient place to land prisoners for exchange.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. A. PARKER,

Commander, Commanding Fifth Division, North Atlantic Squadron.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 22, 1865 - 10.25 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

No changes in the disposition of the troops of this command since last report. Six deserters from the enemy came into our lines during the night.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
