Major General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

Kirby Smith, with 20,000, guards East Tennessee. McCown is at Cumberland Gap. Two brigades at Big Creek Gap. All Bragg's forces moving on Nashville via Sparta, per heavy trains, and by cars for all infantry to Murfreesborough, intending to attack Nashville. I think it imprudent to send Granger's force away now. If the rebels can, they must get back into Kentucky or Tennessee.

Morgan attacked Edgefield on 5th instant, and was repulsed ; simultaneously an attack was made on Nashville ; they were repulsed. We are doing all that can be done to send supplies forward. You will have all you want at Nashville, if we have usual luck. McCook will use his trains to push forward supplies for all. Morgan left Edgefield 4 p.m. on 5th instant. There is a report that he crossed the river 6 miles above Nashville. McCook has sent a regiment of cavalry to communicate with you ; you will hear from them. Kennett is on your front all right. Advance, communicate, and fight when you get a chance.
