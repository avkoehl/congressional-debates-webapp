Mr M MITIN said he si ould not h-ruble the
commitite with 'he remarks which be had desiied
to submit upon the bill under consideration, but
for the denouncement as "ex'raordmar)" by the
gentleman from New York, (Mr Bronson,) of the
amendmet 1 whit h he had gu en notice he would
submit, when m order to do so, to the bill befoie
the committee He had felt it to be his dutj to
himself to piesent fully to h's constituents hi-
views, as well as the pait which he should take,
upon this measi le, but fiom the great labor which
the committee bad un lera ne, t1 e fatigne which
all seemed to feel, and to be borne dow n by, he had
been induced, v hen he gave notice of tne amend-
ment which he would offer, to decline then to
addiess the com.mltee, with the hope that some
more auspicio is occasion w ould be afforded him
of making knoan those views.
That his amendment might seem extiaord nary
to those who considered the provisions of the act of
June, 1 «36 when rcctpted by the States, a con-
tract, which th" Government was bound to exe-
cute undei ad circumstances, and to those, too,
who claim as a debt due fiom the Go ernment

bv many of the gentlemen who have addressed
the committee—did not surprise him Indeed,
when gentlemen can contend, with this act before

the claim which is heie set up to the fo'nth instal-
ment, and that, too, by some of those who voted
for the act of 1836 He said it was known at

wetould vvuh cer ainty iesoit in an) ai it emer-
gei c) which might requite such an mount of
mrsur~. A doubt, he said, nsvtr crosse , lis romd
that it would be looked upon b) the States as their
own, or that its leturn would be delayed for one
moment, after it was needed b) the Government;
and one of the importan' effects which he supposed
it would have upon the legislation of Congress,
would be to piovidp a i economical administration
of the Government by brmsing our responsibility
more nepily hone 'o tne people He well knew
that if the tti if w as «creased, the inquiry would
be made by the people, w hv is this, when vou have
this surplus' And if the surplus with the States
was touched, the people woa'd s-rulimre our con-
duct, and mark oui exhavagance with its merited
rebuke
Mr M said that by recuiring to the history of
tl " act of 1836, it would be cbvious, that the re-
turn of these deposites w as looked to bj the fia-
mers of the act, for he sai 1, as it passed the Se-
nate, in wh'ch it originated, it required the issu-
ance by the Stales to this Government of stcclc
to the amount of the money deposited, whici
it should be the dut\ of the Secretaiy of the
Treasiirj to dispose (f, at anv time when the
monev should be nrcc sal) tj meet the disbui -
ments of the Government—a mode b/ which ihe
amount couidbe reimbursed w it! out cklav or diffi-
culty—that this feature vv as of the bill was changed,
notbuaiise it gave too speedv a mode of obtain
ing Ihe monej again, but that it made the Govern-
ment a dealer in stocks, vhich wis thought objec-
tionable
Mr M said the geit'emm fiom New Yorl ,
(Mr Filmoie,) had labored to piove, th?t by a
pioper construction cl the ?ct of 1836, it wou'd 1 p
impos ible to ob'am a return of the d°po«i'ps with-
in a ver) gre?t length of t me, contending that not
inoie linn two hundred and foitv thousand dolíais
per annum could be demanded even o' the State of
NcwYoik To p it this construction unon that
act, Mi M said was to charge tie last Con/rtss
vv ith nnbecilit) and gross ignorance, to vv nich he
could not agree He said the leturn of the I one)
wasc'eai) contemplated bv the act, and to sup-
pose that so small a sum c s 'h-t s'ated b\ the gen-
tleman was the largest amount for a return of
which any Sta'e could be calHl upen, cou'd not
be true Mi M said the act limited the call of
the Secretar) to ten thousand do'lai- a month fiom
rti) ore State, ' without pievious nc tice of thirty
divsfoi eveiy additional sum tf twciilv Housed
dolíais" Does tins pi )v is on of the bill limit this
