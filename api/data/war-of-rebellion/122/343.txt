SPRINGFIELD, ILL., July 23, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON:

Being advised that you are receiving tenders of additional troops, I desire to tender you for Illinois thirteen additional regiments of infantry, most of them now ready to rendezvous; three additional regiments of cavalry, and one additional battalion of light battery. Illinois has the right to do her full share in the work of preserving our glorious Union from the assault of high-handed rebellion, and insists that you will respond favorably to the tender I have made.
