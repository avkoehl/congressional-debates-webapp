General NAGLEE,

Norfolk, Va.:

The cavalry will arrive here from Williamsburg this afternoon and start to-morrow. There seems a considerable force about Gloucester Court-House, but cannot get particulars. Have you any further instructions? Shall I send the cavalry direct, or land them at Dudley's Ferry and take enemy in rear? It is three hours from here by steamboat. I have 900 effective for the expedition.
