APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ft
39th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Freedmen's Bureau—Mr. Chanter.
Ho. of Reps.
" If we examine this table, we find that in the seven
States named the number of illiterate is about one
fifth the total number of voters, and nearly one lialf
the total vote for Breckinridge, the representative of
disunion and secession.
"If, however, we add to each man entirely illiter-
ate one other who, while able to read and write his
name, derives no practical advantage from these
mere rudiments of education in forming his opin-
ions, we will find the total to be more than one thud
of the total vote and five sixths of the vote for Breck-
inridge. ' .
"The total number ot illiterate in the southern
States in 1860, over twenty years of age, exclusive of
the then slaves, was 545,177. Tn these, with the com-
paratively ignorant associated with them, we see the
upholders ot the rebellion at the ballot-box and in
the field. Without these it could never have been
inaugurated,or if inaugurated could never have main-
tained itself for six months against the mighty levies
of the TJnion.
"But it may be said these evils will correct them-
selves. The testimony is all the other way.
"From 1840 to 1860, a period of twenty yo&rs, the
yiumber of illiterate over twenty years rose from
549,693 to 1,218,311: in other words, an increase of con-
siderably more than one hundred per cent I
" At the same ratio of growth it would be 2,074,472 in
1880 ; 5,823,700 in 1900; and in 1920 it would amount to
the enormous total of 12,596,688.
" In other words, in fifty years from the taking of
the next census, the illiterate in the United States
over twenty years, exclusive of the freedmen, will be
12,500,000, four times the number with which the nation
commenced its career, nearly one half the total white
population in 1860, and representing a voting force
one third grcatei than the total vote at the presi-
dential election in 1860; that is to say, over 6,000,000
voteis!
"Who will pretend that with such amass of igno-
rance the Government could survive? It would be
buried in the most disgraceful anarchy the world has
ever seen. ,
" But, Mr. Speaker, even these appalling figures do
not tell the whole story. These fierures do not include
the then slaves, now fieedmen. We must add to the
ignorant population of the South the 4,000,000 blacks
just released from slavery.
" The figures would stand as follows:
NUMBER OF ILLITERATE.
Year. White. Black, Total.
1880  2,674,472 3,300,175 5,983,647
1900  5,823,700 4.765,212 10,5S8,912
1920 12,596,6S8 5,994,812 18,591,500
" So that in fifty years from tho next census, a very
short period in the life of a nation, when it is sup-
posed that the total population will be 120,000.000, the
illiterate will be one fifth of the entire number and
nearly one third of the entire vote.
"I trust, then, that no gentleman will doubt the
propriety of the amendment I have submitted. We
are interfering in behalf of the negro; let us interfere
to educate him. Wo thus strike out at one blow a
large proportion of the i«noianceof the South; we
shame the whites into an effort to educate themselves,
and we prepare thus both classes for the proper extr-
cise of the right of suffrage.
"Norshall it be said that the ignorance revealed by
these statistics is an exotic, that it results from foreign
immigration. WhileitistructhatintheNorth alarge
proportion of the illiterate are fiom foreign lands, in
the South the lcverse is the case. In North Carolina,
in 1860, the illiterate persons of native birth were
74,877, while those of foreign birth were but 100. In
Alabama the illiterate of native birth were 37,302,
while those of foreign birth were 2,663.
"The total number of illiterate foreigners in the
United States in 1860 was 342,917; while, I am sorry to
say, thoso born under our institutions, and unable at
the age ot twenty years to read and write, were 834,106.
"Let us, however, set aside the foreign infusion al-
together, and divide the illiterate according to the
natural divisions of the country.
" The results are as follows;
No. illiterate of Total
Section. native birth, population.
New England States  8,513 3,135,283
Middle States  93,5*s 7,571,101
Southern St ates 515,177 12,128,01b
Western States. (Ohio. Indiana,
Illinois and Kansas) 146,321
Northwestern States, (Michigan,
Iowa, Minnesota, and Wiscon-
sin):  24,791
Pacific States 12,709
5.509,096
2,371,930
432,459
A comparison of these figures leads, to some sur-
prising results. If, for instance, the ratio of tho New
England States hold good, we should ha re less than
80,000 native-born illiterate persons in tho United
States instead of the 834,000 wo now have. In other
Words, the illiterate nativo voters of the coup Fry
would be loss than 40,000, instead of being over 400,0001
"Ou tho other hand, we find thatthesouthevn States
have a population about equal to the middle and
western States combined, while the number of illiter-
ate in the former is 545,177, as against 241,854 in t4i©
latter; and thisnotincludingthovastnumbcrofiUit-
erate freedmen in the South, who would make the
disproportion still greater. So that the South out-
numbers in illiterate tho most unfavorable portions
of the North more than two to one.
"Ascompaied with the New England States the
disproportion is still more striking. At the ratio of
New England the southern States should have bat
34,000 illiterate persons; as it is the nutober is 045,177.
"The whole United States, with a population of
27,000,000, contains 834,106 illiterate persons, and of
these 545,177 are found in the southern States, with a
population of 12,000,000. In other woidf, the cntiro
populous North contains but 288,923, while the sparse-
ly settled South contains 545,177."
Mr. Speaker, the malignant party spirit and
sectional hate that runs through this whole state-
ment needs no illustration. They illustrate
themselves, as the trail of the snake and the
stench of the pole-cat mark the way of the rep-
tile and vermin.
If the southern people are so unfortunate, why
persecute and slander them? If ignorant, why
exclude them from the pale of Christianity?
Christ wasaNazarene, despised, spit upon, mid
crucilied. lie kept company with Publicans and
sinners, his disciples were the scum of Jewish
society, the most illiterate, ignorant, poor, and
degraded of all the subject of the Koman Em-
pire. Lazarus and the blind beggar would never
have been accepted as lit Christians for fellow-
