SAINT JOSEPH, July 22, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Thornton is person was yesterday at Mandeville, two miles north westerly form Carrollton, in Carroll County, with about 500 men in his increasing rebel horde. The Glasgow troops, re-enforced by our militia in Chariton County, will doubtless turn Thornton westward or fight him if he stands. I shall so dispose of my force as to surround, if possible, the parties under Booth, Thornton, and Thrailkill. Five companies of militia, under Colonel Shanklin, will move south from Chillicothe to-day to co-operate with the Glasgow force.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 22, 1864.

General FISK:

Have you any news of Thornton to-day. I hear from Kansas City that he is moving north. Colonel Fort left Liberty with his command this morning.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 22, 1864.

Major S. S. CURTIS,

Aide-de-Camp, Fort Leavenworth:

Thornton and Thrailkill have probably united their forces to-day in the north part of Ray County from 1,000 to 1,500 strong. I have nothing definite since last night. Am pressing him on all sides with my militia. I hope Colonel Ford will stay in the pursuit until we kill or drive out the last one.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 22, 1864.

General FISK:

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 22, 1864.

Major S. S. CURTIS,

Aide-de-Camp, Fort Leavenworth:

I thank you for the shipment of arms. They will do me much good. I am anxiously waiting the arrival of my Illinois battalion. What time did they leave the fort?
