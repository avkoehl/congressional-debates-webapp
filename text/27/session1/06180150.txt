been confined within 'he sum of the annual and
psrmanent appropriations This rule, which would
seem fo be founded upon aju«t respec for the opi-
nions of those who make ihe appropriations from
ye*r to year, and who hold the power of originat-
ing* taxes, is, perhaps, as much entitled 10 the ob-
servance of the present Secretary as it was to that
of his predecessors For my°elf, I am the more
inclined to insist upon its applicati >n, as I find
that, according to Mr. Ewing's own statement, it
would allow him an expenditure of nearly $20,-
000,000, exclusive of the Post Office and of the re-
demption of Treasury notes—an expeodiiure suffi-
cient under any view of our circumstances, and
even too large upon a comparison of the real ne-
cessity of the public service with ihf present ex
hausled condition of the Treasury. Tnrowmg out
of consideration the Post Office establishment,
(which, hereafter, I shall not consider on either
side of the account,) the entire charges rf the year,
for the annual and permanent appropriations, ex-
clusive of the redemption of Treasury notes are,
according to the Secretary'-, statement, $19 719,
094. This, I believe, is somewhat larger than the
real amount, but I prefer to adopt his o in state-
ments, except in the particulars in which upon
their face they are erroneous Add to this amount
for the redemption of Treasury notes not the
$5,283,831 as es-timated by the Secretary, but
$4,173,220, and the entire charges foi the year
1841 are $23,892,314 The difference between
the amount of Treasury notes to be redeemed, as
stated by the Secretary, and my elf, consist only
in the item of $1,110,611, issued during tbe first
two months of the yeai, under the act ot 1840,
which bear an interest ot six per centum tor a year
from the date of their issue, and are no more
likely to be presented tor payment than the
$5,000,000 issued under the act of 1841. And
here let me correct an error of the untleman
from Massachusetts, [Mi Saltonstall ] who
supposed that tbey ceased to beai interest dur-
ing the present year, and therefore argued that tbey
would probably be returned Tbe Treasury notes
issued under the act of 1840 bear interest
for a year from the date ot their issue, and those
which were issued dunns; the prestnt year, undei
that act, carry interest according to its provisions
There can be no reason, therefore, why capitalists
who invest so greedily in these securities, should
return the issues made under th' act it 1840
during the present year, which would nc t equally
apply to the issues under the act of 1841, ¡>nd
these the Secretary himself does not expect to re
deem.
Let us now see what wtl1 oe the piobably means
of the year, as estimated by th<" Secretary of the
Treasil y. Tbe resources in Treasury notes under
the acts t f 1840 and 1841 weie, for the present
year,'$6,784,292 The means ot other kinds, as
estimatet1 in tha ar nual report of the Sect tary, are
$18,085,691, and a subsequent report trom the
Secretary to the Senat acknowledges a mistake
of $619,136, which he had failed to enter a a re-
ceipt upon a bond of the Bank of ihp Un'f d Sr^tes
Then these sums give us $25 489,119 Here,
again, there is probably a mistake in a failure to
enter the item ot mouuy in tbe mtnt a* a part of
the outstanding balance on ths 1st of January, 1841
But I prefer, as I said before, to take the Secreta-
ry's own statement, and make no question upon
that point. It is sufficient for rae that, upon his
own statement, the difference oetwetn the tan
charges aod receipts for 1841 will prooably amount
to $1,596,805 in favor of the latter And this
surplus would accrue upon the opposition that
the Secr«tary is to show no disposition to relieve
his department by a retrenchment in expenditures,
or by an efficient application of his means, so as to
malts the most of them The calculation supposes
no reform m the expense of collecting thp revenue,
it demands no particular skill from the head of
the Treasury Department in the adaptition of his
means to the ends sought in the appropr ations
Other Secretaries might be expected to exhibit
the high ambition of showing, not with how muel
but with how little m ney the wants of the public
service might be satisfied The people may have
*xpeeted, perhaps, in the present emergency, that
he would have drawn from the resources of that
high financial and executive talent tor which be
was doubtless called to his present tesponsible post,
to devise tbe means of relieving thetr burdens, and
ot imparting increased energy in the use of the
means which they provided. But for myself, sir,
I only ask him to be content with the same rules
and the same stale of expenditure which, under
the present circumstances, would have governed,
if they had not satisfied, any and all of his predeces
tors But, Mr Chairman, the present Secretary
has not been content to abide by this salutary rult
He demands the means for an expenditure of
$6,705,577 n ore than the sum of the annual and
permanent appropriations which both reason and
usage point out as the amount proper to
be expended The last Congress, with a know-
leig  of the usage which governed the Trea-
sury Department and with a full view of the em-
barrassments of the people and nf the wants of the
public service, made its appropna ions and pro-
vided tbe means Those means I think I have
sh iwn were sufficent for thp usual and reasonable
measu'e of expenditure under the existing acts of
appropriation Why, then, should we now be
called upon to lay new burdens upon our constitu-
eals, and to supply Mr Secretary Ewing with the
means of an expenditure greater, by nearly
$7,00 000 than we had anticipated] Has he given
us any reasons for this extravagant demand' I
havt heard none—he has given none A gentle-
man from North Caiohna [Mr McKay] has called
•ipm him foi detailed es'imates of the mode in
\ hich tris extraordmar) expenditure is to be an
plied But no mswer is given The resolution
seems to have gone to that 'undiscovered bourre"
from which there is no return The Secretary of
W>rhas sent us estimates, it is true, of the new
appn rn?tiou fot whioh he asks In addition to
the $15 991 895 out-larding on Uk 3d of March,
he cksire $2 521 336 of ne v appropriations to be
ma''e—and ¡or what? Whv, chiefly for fortifica-
tions audarm?menti, some of which fortifications
are to be entirely new works. Many, and perhaps
all ol these oDjects, with the exception of the new
w rks, may be attained, if nece^ary, by transfers
from old appropriations But, sn, without a mi
nute examination of the extent <f the means of
transfer, it is enousih ioi me that both the report
and the est mates hive failed to convince me that
th senew . ppi (pnalion are necessary A portion
of th $800 000 asked for the Florida wai ought,
perhaps, to be appropriated, but if it were, the sur
plus oí $1,596 805 would much more than cover
any me< ssary demand for this pi i pose But tbe
gentleman "rom Massachusetts [Mr Saltonstall]
s ems to think that we ought to take the fact ot
the demand of the Secretary of the «Treasury as
evidence ot us necessity, inasmuch as he must be
betttr acqua nted with the wants of the public ser-
vice than we can bt Sir, I take issue with that
gentleman, and rna ntain that the very fact that
the Secie'ary ought to be conversant with these de
tails, with which wecannot be minutely acquainted,
leads to the reverse conclusion—that we ou^ht to
demand ihe reasons for the requisition, before we
maki the appropnati >n, otherwise we should lose
Ihe powi.1 of originating r oney b IK, with which
this Hou e is particularly'mves ed bj the Consti-
tution, under the plea of isnorance as to the best
mode ot using it, and have no olhei measure of
the grant th i i that oí ihe deman U of the Trea-
sury If the Secre'ary proposes an unusual
amount oí expend ture ne have a right to de-
mand his reasons for it If none be given, and
there be none within our own knowledge, we are
not only justified in refusing tbe extra means, but
we are bound to Unit his supplies to necessary and
useful objects, if tnis be ihe only legal mode by
which we can íes ram him
C nfiden-e, Mr Chairman, is «aid to be a
plant of slow growth, and why «honld I thus
bestow mine upon Mr. Secretary Ewing, in
advance of any reason for it' Shall I nnd
m> virran  ior it in his proposition to expend
more than the sum ot tbe annual anl permanent
apnrnpnations by nearly $7,000,000' Shall I look
for y justificatnn in his request that we borrcw
$4,000,000 to he idle in the Treasury as a surplus'
Or shall I find it in his series of recommendations
for the issue of more than $30,000,000 in United
Slates stock' Whilst, on the one hand, he recom-
mends a new tax of 20 per cent upon nearly all
of the free articles—amounting, as he supposes, to
about $57,000,000, he proposes, on th  other, to
distribute the proceeds of the public lands, and
waste the inheritance which it was his duty to have
guarded and preserved. Are these the evidences
of his economy and wisdom, which are to induce
me to trust him thus blindly with the means for
these extravagant expenditures? or am I to seek
them in that magnificence of conception, and con-
tempt tf small matters, which were exemplified in
his failure to credit the revenue with more than six
hundred thousand dollars, as an item too diminu-
tive to attract his sublime regards' Mr Chairman,
he may thus have won ll e confidence of other gen-
tlemen, but he must use other means if he wins
mine I cannot, and wnl not, vote the means for
this extraordinary expenditure, unless he or his
friends give me some reason to justify it.
But I am told, if the Secretary were to confine
himself within the rule which his preoecessors have
adopted, that there would still be an amount of
Treasurv notes outstanding at the close of the year
True, sir, there would be, upon this suppo uion,
nearly $7,000,000 then omstanding But they
won d no' be presented for payment until they
ceased to bear interest, and if Government had the
means, it probably would not have the opportunity
to redeem them, exce¡ t in small parcels, until the
close of the y .ar There will he ample time at the
next regular session to provide foi their redemption.
With increased economy in he public expendi-
tures, w hich has been promised, and ought to be
used, even ti e prest nt sourtes of revenue, with the
power to re issue, to a small extent, would furm*h
the means of redemption within a year or two at
the farthest. Or if the same scale of expendnure
is to ba continued, the new taxes which may be
laid wh'n tne tariff comes up for re adjustment
w ill enable the Department to redeem ihem as fast
as they will be presented Or if a loan be the fa-
vonte mode, there will be time enough next win
ter to borrow the money, as soon as it will be
wanted But the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr CusHinq] seemed to think tnat, if ha could
prove Treasury note? to be evilences of debt,
he had then demonstrated tnat th s bill pre-
sented only a question as to the particnlar form
of «eeurity by which that debt is to be evidenced
Sir, I admit that these Treasury notes are eviden-
ces of debt, and yet I am far from assenting to the
other conclusion. I admit that, even in my view
ot the case, the Treasury notes wilt present evi-
dences of debt, outstanding but not due at the end
of the year, to the amount of nearly $7,000 000
The Treasury note was selected not only as the
cheapest and most convenient form of security
upon which we could raise the money, but because
under that form the public debt might be gradually
paid as they were presenteJ, in the process of col-
lecting th" revenue It, then, we have secured
the debt in a manner agreeable to the public credi-
tor and convenient to <urselves, why should we
now borrew money—not to pay, but to change the
deb' before it is due? Why borrow $12,000,000,
¡1 $7,000,000 be all that we should ultimately owe?
And why, it we determine even to change the form
of the debt, raise the money before the Govern-
ment can have the opportunity to redeem these
notes, even if it had the means? These notes will
not be presented until they cease to bear interest,
and the Treasury would probab'y have no chance
to redeem them, except in small parcels, until to-
wards the c'ose of the year But is it a question
as to the mere form in which we shall secure the
debt? Does not the power to re ís-ue $5,000,000
in these Treasury notes endure through the year,
and is there any proposition to tske it way? "Un-
less the $12 000,000 is borrowed on 'he supposition
that a part of it will be wanted to suppiy the place
of tbe Tr asury notes which will come in durins
the year, it is a naked proposition to raise money
uoan loan, under pretence of paying a debt a year
before it will be presented or can be discharged
If tbis bill pass, sir, it will, with the existing laws,
give the Secretary the power to borrow $17,000,
