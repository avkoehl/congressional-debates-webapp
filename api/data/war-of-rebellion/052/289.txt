HDQRS. THIRD DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,15 Miles from Pikeville, 5 Miles from Dunlap, Tenn.,

September 1, 1863-2 p.m. (Received 10.30 p.m.)

Lieutenant Colonel LYNE STARLING,

Chief of Staff, Twenty-first Army Corps:

COLONEL: We left Pikeville this morning at 6 o'clock. Encamp here to-night. Can reach Jasper inn good season on the 3rd. I left Colonel Klein with battalion of cavalry at Dunlap to guard commissary stores for a day or two, till Colonel Minty's teams could take them over the mountain. Corn and potatoes being abundant, our men consumed but a small amount of hard bread, leaving considerable on hand; that was turned over to the commissary of the cavalry for want of transportation.

I sent a courier to turn my train to Dunlap, and also Colonel Minty's which will leave McMinnville to-morrow.

Your most obedient servant,

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

NASHVILLE, September 1, 1863-11 a.m.

General GARFIELD:

Dispatch of 31st received this morning . The Alexandria force was ready to move at a moment's notice. I forwarded the order from Murfreesborough. On August 30 instructed Colonel Shelley to report his arrival at department headquarters. Have instructed Colonel Mizner to move his regiment, and keep the country in the vicinity of Franklin clear of guerrillas.

Major General GORDON GRANGER,

Nashville:

The general commanding desires General Steedman to relieve the Sixty-ninth Ohio Regiment, now at Cowan, and permit it to come forward. There are 650 convalescents there which, with two additional companies, will probably form a sufficient garrison for the present.

By order:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
