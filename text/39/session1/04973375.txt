THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3375
the committee was whether, as the Department
would pay these notes in a little more than two
years, we should furnish any present relief.
Some of the committee thought not, because
the time was so short.
Mr. PRICE. Will the gentleman yield to
me for a moment ?
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. Cer-
tainly.
Mr. PRICE. I wish the House to pay a little
attention to this matter of dollars and cents.
In my opinion these notes are good in the
hands of the holder. Should an innocent party |
present these notes at anytime prior or subsc- '
quent to the date of their maturity, they would I
be good against the Government. Now, if the
Government establishes by the passage of this
bill the precedent of paying these notes because
they have been lost, it will subject itself to the
liability of paying them twice over, and there
will be no remedy.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Illinois. Such a pre-
cedent would ruin any Government.
Mr. PRICK. I know it is said that these par-
ties propose, by the terms of this bill, to give
security to indemnify the Government against
loss. But I need not. say to the gentlemen who
compose this House that security these days
amounts to just nothing at all; that a bond of
security to pay twelve months after date, nine
times out of ten amounts to nothing. Business
men all understand this, and none better than
the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Wasii-
nuRX] who reports this bill. Again, if we
establish this precedent we are liable to have
bills presented here to pay every man, woman,
and child who may have sent or who may send
a five-dollar note or a lil'ty-dollar note through
the mail, and it is lost, and there is no reason
in the world why we should not pass all those
bills as well as this one. And it so, where will
the matter end? I hope that, for the safety of
the Government this bill will cither be with-
drawn or voted down.
Mr. WASIIBURN, of Massachusetts. Per-
sonally I have 110 objection to this hill being
voted down. But the gentleman from Iowa
[Mr. Piuce] is mistaken in one thing; these
notes are not a part of the circulation of the
country.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. They read
"pay the bearer.''
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. They
are not a part of the circulating medium of the
country. The Committee of Claims have de-
cided that no compensation shall be made for
the loss of any portion of the circulating me-
dium of the country. Every one of these notes
is on record, and no one can present any of
them for payment without the Government,
being aware of it.
Mr. PRICE. That is true: hnt at the same
time they are good in the. hands of the holdej,.
And they are also a part of the circulating
medium of the country ; whether so intended
or not when issued, is another question. The
fact is that they pass from hand to hand, pay-
able to bearer, and are part of the circulation
of the country.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. It is
not a question of any very great importance.
I want a vote on it, and therefore I call the
previous question.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I appeal
to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.
Washburn] to withdraw his call for the pre-
vious question, and let this bjll be recommit-
ted to the Committee of Claims.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. Very
well. I have no objection to that. I withdraw
the call for the previous question, and move
that the bill be printed, and recommitted.
The motion was agreed to.
REIMBURSEMENT TO WASHINGTON CITY.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, from
the Committee of Claims, reported a bill to
pay and discharge certain debts and expendi-
tures to the corporation of the city of Wash-
ington.
The bill, which was read, proposes that the
Secretary of the Treasury be authorized to pay
to the proper authorities of the city of Wash-
ington tliÂ« sum of $31,971 34; in full for all
claims which the city of Washington now has
against the United States, on account of mon-
eys expended in improving the streets, ave-
nues, alleys, and public grounds in the city
of Washington, and for repairing any of the
bridges crossing the Potomac river prior to
May 5, 1864; provided that before payment of
the sum appropriated the mayor of Washington
city shall present to the Commissionerof Public
Buildings an account embracing cach item of
charge which the city has against the United
States for the expenditures referred to, which
account the Commissioner shall certify to be
correct and just.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I rise to
the point of order that this bill contains an
appropriation, and must therefore be referred
to the Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union.
The SPEAKER. The Chair sustains the
point, of order, and the bill will be referred to
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
WILLIAM 0. LEE.
Mr. McKEE, from the Committee of Claims,
reported back House bill No. (521), for the ben-
efit of William G. Lee, with a recommenda-
tion that it pass.
The bill, which was read, proposes to direct
the Secretary of the Treasury to pay to William
G. Lee the sum of $28,'128 80, in full payment
of his claim against the United States on ac-
count of corn purchased by him in the depart-
ment of Kentucky as agent of the quartermas-
ter' s department, under agreement, made by him
with Captain .lolin A. Morris in 180-1, which
corn spoiled on his hands by reason of the
Government failing to furnish transportation.
Mr. WASHBURNE) of Illinois. I raise the
point, of order that this bill contains an appro-
priation, and must, under the rule, go to the
Committee of the Whole on the Private Cal-
endar.
The SPEAKER. 'The Chair sustains the
point of order; and the bill will be referred to
the Committee of the Whole on the Private
Calendar.
Mr. McKEE. I move, then, that the rules
be suspended, and that the House now resolve
itself into the Committee of the Whole, in or-
der that we may proceed to the consideration
of this bill.
The SPEAKER. By the order of the House,
the regular business of the morning hour can-
not be interrupted by any other business.
