He counted ninety-three, but the others said that there were more than 100 vessels, forty of them being steamers, the balance sail vessels; the large ship or frigate still aground on the bar. There were twenty steam and sail inside the sound; that is, over the 'swash." Only one steamer seemed to have steam up, and she appeared to be pulling off a vessel which was aground. I forgot to mention that pilots were told on Tuesday that the enemy was expecting thirty more vessels. The pilot seen by Mr.---- also said that when he was taken on board the flag-ship he noticed the vessels as closely as he could, and he could see on them only two guns each, one in the bow and one in the stern. He did not, however, go on board any but the flag-ship.
