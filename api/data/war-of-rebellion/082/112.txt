COLONEL: I did not see the engineer officer on his return to-day from the front, but, from investigation since made, I am satisfied that the rifle-pit spoken of in my dispatch of 11 this a.m. will, if continued, enfilade a part of the line of the First Brigade. At the time of writing, 8.15 p.m., everything is very quiet along the line and further than the above no change.

Very respectfully,
