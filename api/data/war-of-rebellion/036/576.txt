REPORTS. *

Number 1. -Major General William T. Sherman, U. S. Army, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps.

Number 2. -Brigadier General Louis Hebert, c. S. Army.

Number 1. Report of Major General William T. Sherman, U. S. Army, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps. ON BOARD FLAG-SHIP BLACK HAWK, Below Haynes' Bluff, May 1, 1863.

DEAR GENERAL: Am this moment in receipt of yours from below Grand Gulf. + Have sent orders for Steele's and Tuttle's DIVISIONS to move to Perkins', and shall follow to-morrow. We will be there as soon as possible.

Tuttle will move by the new road, and Steele by Richmond.

Yesterday the new Choctaw, followed by all the other gunboats and our transports, approached the Bluff. We kept up a heavy fire, which was returned by the enemy. The Choctaw was struck FIFTY-three times, but her injuries are not in any vital part. Strange to say, no one was hurt. The De Kalb also was uninjured. The Tyler caught one shot on her water-line, which is repaired. I disembarked the command at Blake's negro quarters, and made disposition as for attack, which was kept up till after dark, drawing heavy fire.
