To tile House of I'cpresentntivet :
I have received and have taken into consideration

dren of John M. Biker, decayed." and pursuant to
the duty required ot me by thoCon.stitutioii I return
the same with my objections lo the House ot Repre-
sentatives, in which it origlliated.
The bill proposes to (>:iy luurn of money to the
children of John M. Baker, deceased, late United
States consul at Rio Janeiro, lor services of that
person as acting charg6 d'affaires of the United
States in the year 1834. So lavas it can bo ascer-
tained it is apprehended that tho bill may have
received tho sanction of Congress through some
inadvertenco, for upon inaniry at the proper de-
partment it appears that Mr! Baker never did act
as charge d'affaires of the United States at, Kio
Janeiro, and that ho was not authorized so to act,
but on the contrary was expressly forbidden to enter
into diplomatic correspondence with the Govern-
ment ot Brazil.

which is annexed, addressed by William L. Marcy,

believed have not since diminished, and in which I
fully concur.
