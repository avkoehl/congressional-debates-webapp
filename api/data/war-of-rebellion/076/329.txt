recruits come to me daily by tens and hundreds than to await them in larger bodies more difficult to transport. Our cars could bring me 400 daily without overloading.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

Too many citizens mange to come to the front. Be even more stringent than heretofore. Great no passes beyond Chattanooga, and only the smallest possible number that far. Surgeons can fill the officers of the Sanitary Commission, and chaplains minister to the wants of the soldiers. If any recruits are coming from the North, I want them forwarded with dispatch by the cars.

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, AUGUST 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The cavalry horses in this district are less than 3,000 all told. Had I not better order cavalry from Memphis to this line by such route as will avoid the necessary of fighting any of the enemy before reaching us; and also demonstrate from Memphis by such other troops as may be available.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

Don's call for any cavalry from Memphis. General A. J. Smith has his orders to watch Forrest, and if he comes to Tennessee to follow his to Decatur. He will want all his cavalry. Only collect the scattered detachments of cavalry and order more horses to be pursed to remount the dismounted cavalry in General Thomas' department at Columbia and elsewhere. A good many of General McCook's cavalry are coming in by squads to Marietta.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, August 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Can pick up from the corrals and teams here about 1,200 horses, besides the 3,000 now in use, mentioned in telegraph this forenoon. Will send 600 to Decatur at once to rebound a regiment there. Will use the other to mount cavalry here. Will push them forward as fast as possible.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.
