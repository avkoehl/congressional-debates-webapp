Ho. of Reps.
"set a rogue to catch a rogue " With equal pro-
priety, then,  e should place 041 that committee
iawyeis of the opposite party, to watch the oppo-
site lawyers, to investigate with the opposite Iaw-
yeis, and to report with the opposite 1 iwyers
This, sir, is the unreasonable request that we
havt mide, as the lepresentatives of the Repub-
lican party, and for which we are all denounced
as obstinate, pei verse, and with a disposition to
thwart the investigation which we have com-
menced     Will the people judge it so'
Mr C H WILLIAMS  tose to a point of or-
der lie wished to know if the wide discursiv*
course taken by the gentleman from Nqrth Caio
hna was in order when the subject was only to
excuse a membei fiom acting on the commit
tee!
The SPCAKER replied that the gentleman
fiom North Carolina was strictly in order He
had been pioeeediog to show the chaiactei of the
committee, so far as organized, and the necessity
of its h-avjng a partirulai chaiactei, in justice to
the House, and to individuals, as impeachable
raattu might giow out of it This he thought
he had aught to do, and that consequently the
gentleman was in older
Mi BYJMUM I thank the gentleman fiom
Tenn^ssci foi his kind disposition to keep me in
ordei t have no doubt of the smceiity of his
motive , and the benevolence of lus object The
party to which that gentleman belongs have cer
tamlygiyen many evidences of then gieatiegaid
tot the oidei of this House, and shown thcgieat-
tst disposition to ke< pall in order who deviate m
the least fiom any subject bcfoie it But unfoi-
tunately for the guitkmin and his party, they
nevei i;sc t> a point of order until some Demo
ciat of the RepuLliean party is about to dissect
the materials out of which theyaie composed,
and to show their lotlennas to the open gaze of
-in abused people
It is never until then, sir, the giggle of ap-
plause, and the cry of " Go on ' go on '" ceases
io reverberate thtough this Houses and that more
ominous and doleful one is substituted by Un m
tn Us placehcio-—" Older' otdu ' Mr Sptaku,
I rise, sit, to a point of oidei " licit, again, m
isee the lesuit of that deficiive memoiy, how
univcisnlly it seems (o picvail wiih evi iy mem
•icr of the paity' But, sir, away with that
We have been told that we wanted the luidas of
the party on that committee Ibis, as fin ns my
knowledge extends, would be a most difficult
task to execute by the Dcmociatic paity If
they have leaders, lam yet to liain who they
aic I know them not In my judgment, the
want of such Ieadeis as has been ascubed to it
is one oí the giratest misfortunes of that pai ty at
this time That, I confess, is now one of the
gieatest defects in the paity they scknowlodgi
no Ieadeis, and consequently act neaily on eveiy
occasion without the least conceit, by which
means often, though in a majouty, they have
Euffued themselves to be defeated by their moie
wily and better dulled adversam s, wlio ever move
at the tap pf the drum, undei then dull majors
This defect I have often w-uned my party of,
and cajled on them to piofit by the lesson taught
them on that subject by then more skillful and
astute opponents in all paity Uctics A paity
whose every move is at the bidding of their most
renowned leaders, surely should be the last on
■earth to find fault with others for obtdience to
the, will of their ieadeis, but in this, too, they
may arrogate to themselves the exclusive right
of being led, and, from habit, no doubt, would
have the world consider that a virtue in them
which would be a heinous and crying sm in all
otheis This, though, is only one of the rue
characteristics of that party—it is but a part of
their system
But .suppose we were to wish to place oui
leaders, if any we have, on that committee would
it be doing more than the Whigs have done'
They have placed on it leaders at whose nod they
move as though by " instinct " Then would it
be so very unfair to place by their sides at least
one Democratic leader, if such there be ' If this
were all true that is stated, for one I cannot see
the least cause of complaint on the part of the al-
lied pat ties, if they entertain the remotest idea of
a fair and an impartial investigation} and instead
of its being urged as an objection, if the object is
an impartial investigation, the Ieadeis of one
party being blaced on the committee, it affords
the strongest and most irrefutable reason why
those of the other party should be, to meet and
confront them Than this objection, then, they
must look out for some better reason to sanction
then partial and illiberal course on this occasion
This same gentleman spoke of quibhlmglawyers
duibbhng lawyers' Why, sir, this brief vic-
toiy, achieved by the "seciet ballot" system,
seems to have run the party mad Quibbling
lawyers' Why, sir, of what is their whole party
matle up ' To quibble about technicalities, and
the inviolability of incorporated puvileges, and
their entire nresponsibihty to the will or wishes
of the people, whom they insult and rob and
plundei, is their religion—their daily vocation
here and elsewhere—the life's blood of the whole
party, it ilowsandcirculates, and can be alone sus
tamed, by a quibble, as it has ever been by that
illustrious brood in all ages, the craft family What,
su ' six lawyers to be placed on a committee of
nine, of one party and Us allies, and for them
now to complain for fear that their opponents
should piare thiee others on the same committee
that would quibbjo' The idea can only be enter
tamed, by any portion of the intelligent people
of this countiy, as one of the supremely ndicu
lous, and as an insult to the undeistanding of
those whom they would attempt to dupe by the
use of it
Never, nevei, sir, m my judgment, has there
been a pai ty before so straitened for a plausi
ble reason, even on which to hang an excuse
for their most singular and flagrant inconsisten
cíes
If, sir, this be the character of the commence-
ment of the reign of their dynasty m this House,
and m this country, what has the country to hope
fiomitsconsummation,itsmatunty,and its term-
ination' In its veiy inception its birth has been
maiked with all llie cold blooded, hollow heait
cdness of the hyporiite, such as has infected
mankind in all agís, ind bowed down the might
lest nations of the tuth in time of yore Sir,
thn> handwnting is pel fectly legible, and is plain
ly to bo toul in the histoiyof all n itions that
have passed befoi * us, by those who have the
moialcouiao;e, tin boldness and industry to scan,
ex unine, and pioelaim it Dut fiom this point I
will not digicss furthei, as I may have, on some
future occasion, a better opportunity of exposing
moie fully the true chaiactei of this mongiel
patty, its objects, its principles, and its fallacies
I he brief view which I have taken heie of the
history of its conduct, if nothing more, I hope
will have the effect to call out others more capa
ble than myself, upon some more fit occasion, to
do justice to the histories of those contending
pai ties
Mr Speaker, with an air peculiar to the pre
sumption of the paity fiom which it comes, it
has been \auntingly asked the Republican party
of this House, who aio your candidates to be lun
to be placed on this committee > Sir, I know of
no cindidate in the Democratic paity, nor do I
niesume that an individual Democrat in this
House knows of such a one Wc know, from
the votes of the House as repeatedly given, as
well do they, who aie desned to be placed on the
committee by that party, but every one of whom
the allied party has as obstinately and pertina-
ciously refused Away, then, with such affected
blind nesss, as apiece, of a kindred with the whole
project of your glossed designs, in a consumma-
tion to effect your political purposes' Sir, it is
idle to talk thus, when it is appaientbyeveiyact
that the men that wc have determined on to select
for that committee, it has been fixed, settled on
and avowed on this floor, by that party which
now mies the House here, shall not be placed
there, to watch, meet, to aid or oppose their de-
signs Such taunting avowals here are adding
insult to mjiiiy, and tampering with the public
sense, which they appear determined to wrong,
and leaves reason for an awful foreboding as to
the result of this investigation
Permit me to say that this mode of selecting
the committee by " secret ballot," and divesting
the Speaker of that power, in conformity with
the uniform rule and long established practice of
the House, has been sprung upon us, and is as
singulai and novel as us execution has been foul,
paitial, illibeial and unjust to the niajouty of this
House, and a majority of the fieemen of this
country, as I have before shown Sir, the want
of a knowledge of the compact alliance of these
two parties, precluded the belief of the possibility
of such a state of things in the mmd of any mem
ber of the Democratic party, hence, out of this
House, they had not resolved on íunning any
men, or set of men, to be placed on this commit-
tee Will this answer be satisfactory to honoi
able gentlemen who seem so much at a loss to
know why we had not done so
But we have been asked again, in an an of
stately emphasis, was there no caucus candidates
resolved on by your pai ty' For the reasons stated
before, there were none, and such a resolve would
have been evidence of an insight of what had been
determined on by the allied parties, of which we
could have had none, without suspecting that
which all were unwilling to believe No, sir, we
had no evidence of such designs, and had no right
to act on such a piesumption I ask, in reply, if
they had no caucus to determine on whom to place
on that committee' and pause for a íeply [No
leply ] Then, su, the presumption is that they
did I have ascertained, since coming to the
House this morning, th it one blanch of the coa-
lition did hold a caucus, (the Conservatives,) and
deteimmed on whom they weie to elect in " seciet
ballot"—a just commentary, too, on the piesent
composition and condition of this House, and the
íespect paid to the sovereign power of a majority
of the freemen of this country, when a knot of
twelve Conservatives get together and resolve on
who are to be placed on a committee of this House
to repiesenttwohundipd and forty two members,
and a gi eat majority of the people of tins country
Could anything show moie conclusively the en-
tile rottenness of the whole foundation of this
matter, as proposed to he carried on by this alli-
ance' This mfoimation 1 have from a distin-
guished member, who stands high in the Con-
seivauve íanks, but who has not been treated
with the gieatcst íespect even by thtm on this
occasion So much as to the justness of their
ehaige of caucusing against the Democratic party
of this House, and so much for the tiuthand
justness of the charges of the Whig or Tederal
party against the Democracy of this House, for
the course that they have thought fit to pursue in
relation to the present subject Lot the country
take it, and we will abide their decision
Again, I will briefly notice the character and
constitution of this committee It has been said
that this committee was to act only the part of
grandjurois,composed of impartial, uncommitted
men, to report with impartiality the result of their
conviction, after hearing impartially the evidence,
and then, sir, to leave all further pi osecution and
tnal to others This would be in conformity
with the principles of common law and justice, to
which the lowest individual is entitled under the
Constitution and the law Very different, how-
ever, is the complexion of this committee, on
which is placed the prosecutor, who is to act the
part of the juror and the attorney, who is to be the
judge of the validity of the articles of impeach-
ment that he himself has drawn up Such is the
striking íesemblance of the character of this com-
mittee to that of an inquest of an impartial, disin-
teiested grand jury, upon which is placed neither
judge, prosecutor, nor attorney Such, sir, are
the striking characteristics of these two luminals,
differing m every essential attribute, as much as
midnight darkness does from daylight A tri-
bunal of such an organization can but be looked
upon as revolting to the rights of freemen, and
furnishing no protection to the rights of property,
nor to the most honest and uncontammated char-
acter But I will not dwell longer on this sub-
ject
One word more upon the immediate proposition
of the honorable member from Pennsylvania,[Mr
Wagener,] now before the House, to be excused
from serving on the committee A request so rea-
sonable, sir, one could hardly have supposed there
would have been a single objection to The gen-
tleman informs the House that he is disinclined to
serve, and has advanced some most salutary rea-
sons.   Though of the highest respectability, yet,
