General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Columbus, Ga.:

Your dispatch of the 19th submitted. * If the statement in relation to the Nineteenth Corps be reliable, alarm in relation to Mobile must have been unfounded. Dispatch to you last night (direct to Montgomery to-day), to care of General Hood, Atlanta, directed you to urge prompt compliance on the part of General Smith. You can communicate to him as from me.
