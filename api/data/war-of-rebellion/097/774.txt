HARPER'S FERRY, April 15, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

Mosby was at Leesburg yesterday. Is still there to-day. Has his own command and part of White's battalion with him. Is trying to induce all stragglers to join his command. There are large numbers of his command at Leesburg and adjoining county, and coming in every day-some of them paroled, many of them not. A scout sent into Loudoun yesterday returned to-day with three prisoners, one of them of Mobberly's gang. I think I shall secure this evening the three remaining members of the Mobberly band.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
