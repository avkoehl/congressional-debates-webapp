LOUISVILLE, April 20, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Seven days ago I telegraphed the chief quartermaster at Saint Louis, by authority from Lieutenant-General Grant, to withdraw from the frontier transportation of the Missouri department 3,000 mules for your use. These mules will now be coming in and will be shipped to Nashville as fast as they arrive. I will strip the city teams here of all the good stock and will derive some 250 good mules and draft horses from this source. Every resource is brought in requisition to add to your transportation. If time were allowed it would be complete.

ROBT. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General.

I wish you would be certain as to Longstreet's withdrawal, and in what state he has left the railroad from Bull's Gap to Abingdon. I don't intend to operate in that direction, and only want to be sure of the actual state of the railroad, bridges, &amp;c., on our flank and rear when we do move.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
