and for special duty at Cumberland. The Twelfth Virginia will be embarked here, and must be ordered to be ready day after to-morrow. The Fifteenth Virginia may be concentrated on a suitable point on the railroad and embark there. Reports from all the regiments must be made to the chief quartermaster of the wagons and other material left behind, and an officer and guard left with them until received. the two pieces of artillery now reported to be at Webster have to be sent to Beverly to join Captain Keeper's battery. They will follow such troops as are intended by me to proceed to Beverly from Webster. Every effort should be made to have the troops prepared in time, so that no delay occurs and the enemy given no opportunity to interfere with and interrupt our movements. Your headquarters will remain at New Creek; department headquarters at Cumberland.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
