HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, April 15, 1865-1 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Middle Military Division, Winchester:

The President, Mr. Lincoln, was assassinated at Ford's Theater last evening and is now dying. The Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, was also stabbed in his bed, and is not expected to recover. I shall not be able to send my cavalry as your ordered, as I wish to use them in scouring the country for the assassins.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, April 15, 1865.

General C. C. AUGUR,Commanding Department of Washington:

General Stevenson reports that this scouts form Loudoun report that Mosby is at Leesburg to-day with quite a force, and that a great many stragglers are joining him. Only a few of his men have given themselves up.

Respectfully,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

PISCATAWAY, April 15, 1865.

Captain R. CHANDLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I arrived in this place at 7 a. m., and at once sent a man to Chapel Hill to notify the cavalry at that point of the murder of the President, with description of the parties who committed the deed. With the arrangements which have been made it is impossible for them to get across the river in this direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DAVID D. DANA,

First Lieutenant and Provost-Marshal, Third Brigade.

[First indorsement.*]

I have reliable information that the person who murdered Secretary Seward is Boyce or Boyd, the man who killed Captain Watkins in Maryland. I think it without doubt true.

D. D. DANA.

[Second indorsement.]

Lieutenant-Colonel KING:

Captain McGowan knows all about this Boyce or Boyd, and can tell you more than I can in regard to him. Lieutenant Dana is still on the search with cavalry, and is instructed to keep on until he finds somebody.

R. C[HANDLER].
