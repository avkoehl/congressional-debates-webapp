HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 25, 1862.

Major-General HORATIO G. WRIGHT,

Cincinnati:

Reliable scout just in, who saw Morgan cross Cumberland. Am satisfied Morgan has only 3,000 men and two pieces of artillery. His telegraph battery is broken. With a little vigor, he can be trapped. Shall order Reynolds to mount his infantry, and try vigorously to intercept him.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

Baird's division will do; but suspect this is all a scare, so far as numbers go. Keep other divisions ready to move, as it will be better to be ready at one point, if we uncover the other, than to be whipped in detail. You had better go yourself and take command (leaving Gilmore at Lexington), and whip Morgan. You won't want much cavalry; that at Munfordville will do. The movement must depend on further information. Rosecrans will move on Murfreesborough, and Reynolds, with four brigades, on Glasgow and Bowling Green.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25, 1862.

Major-General GRANGER,

Lexington, Ky.:

Report now is that Morgan has but three cavalry regiments and eight guns. If this is so, the force at Munfordville is enough, and orders to Baird should be countermanded; at any rate he should go no farther than Lebanon. The important points to hold are, in my opinion, Frankfort, Lexington, and Danville, and you have force enough to hold them. It is not possible to send you any more troops at present, and you must make the best disposition you can of what you have, for the above and any other objects you can accomplish. Danville is the least important of [these] three places.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING, December 26, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

General Sheridan's division has all moved out of camp, followed by Johnson. I will move in a few minutes. If you have anything important for me, please send it now.

A. McD. McCOOK,Major-General.
