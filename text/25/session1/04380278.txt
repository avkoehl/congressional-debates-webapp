APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
125th Cong__1st Sess.
Sept. 1837.
Postponement of fourth { ,stalrnent—Mr. Underwood.
H. of Reps.
will not go into the argument m support of th s
claim now. Th'  subject was fully considered
during the last Congress. I place the proceeds of
the sales of lands not ceded by the Stat s upon the
same footing as if thev had bet i ceded I v ote i
for the deposite act of 1836, regauling it as a dis-
tribution of the money arising from the sJes of the
public domain, and I now regard it a duty to re-
lease all pretences oí clpim upon the Sta'es foi its
re payment My policy will be to divide ami ng
the States the proceeds of the siles of 'he public
land, and then support this Government oy a dis-
criminating tariff, having m view the protection oi
domestic industry, and limiting the revenue lo the
enconomical «ants of the GovirnmTt I lock

The President's statement is far from being com-
plete. In the discharge of h s constitutional duty,
he should have explained the " antecedí rt causes'"
which gave the " Jir-t impulse-" It vou, JV'r
Chairman, were to arrive at a place coveted vith

When President Jackson withdrc \ th" tuDltc mo-
ney from the Bank of the  Un ted Staff- and de-
posited  it with  State banl-s, and  v neibe pi <ccd
his veto upon the  reeharter of  u e Eari     rr the
United States, it was manifest to the LciUatuus
of the several State', that the Bank of t e Unit d
States could not survive the powerful i pp isition of
the Executive.   It was further man je-t tha  the
Executi'v-e designed trying an "expenr ítnt' to give
the n-tion a " bed'r curren"y," through the msiru-

when rrosi n \olved, we were called on for pay-

The rep >rt of our commercial operations for the

and in the existence and exercsc of the veto novve1-,
vhich, <>s no v es abjished by the Constitution,
makes your Pi sident p a"tie illy a monarch As
tie Const tut on now stards, it requires two thirds
of each house to pass a hill in opposition to the
Executive veto If a majority only had been ne-
ces-arv, the bill rechartenng thf Bank of tne Uni-
ted States v;oildliave been passed, notwithstanding
tht opposition of President Jackson No one now
doubts the salutary influence that the reeharter of
that bank would have exe.cised in preventing the
enormous mcreasi, of State banks, and the "exces-
sive issues of bank paper " But the veto power
trip nphed over th  interests of Ine coun'rv, and it
will, sir, in a'l tine to com , place the President
aoove the representatives of the people, and make
him the master over all,u> less the Constitution can
be anrmdc 1 in tne manner proposed b} me during
the last Congress
[Here ue emm internosed, and t Id Mr TJ

qu-stions could have no bearing on the bill before

I deem it essent al, sir, to trace ihe stream to its
' jurce   I have done «o and the great efficient rem-
edy for existing evils, and for those which may
visit this nation m consequence of the arbitrary acts
of the Fxecutive, in all time to come, is an amend-
ment of the Constitution, by which the President
shah be controlled by a majonly of ihe Representa-
tives of th  people But for the veto power, I
should entertain s'tong hopes that the present Con-
gress would res ore the currency and the public
piospp-ny / s u 'S, I have no hope, during the
e <is ence of the present Administration
Permit me in a kw words to call the attention
of my eastern brethren to the condition of the inte-
rior Wester i States We, who live in the valley of
th? Oaio, do not supDly ourselves v. uh merchandise
at the } laces where vv e s=ll our agricultural produc-
tions Our iorses, nules, hogs, tobacco, hemp,
&c &c <ue til-en tor market hundreds of miles
tj ti o -tu') nd southwest of us Our dry goods
are purchased .n Baltimor , Philadelphia, and
New York, hundreds of miles to the east and north-
east of us Now, sir, it is indispensable to our
piospentj as a people, that we should be paid for
our pi o luce sold at the =outh and southwest, in
'hat kind of cu rency which will enable us to pay
ior the goods we consume, wilhoutsustaimng a loss
upon if We oik e had that currency m the notes of
t'ie B-nk oi the United States     But how is it now?
0  p of our tiaders sells a drove ot horses or mule 
11 Mississippi oi Louisiana, he must «-eceive the
State b^nk pipe , .> he cannot spII , and, when he
gels n, h>-s to undergo alrpost as much trouble to
exchange it for som"th pg that will pass at home,
■> d pay in ' umers for their mules and hoises, as
oe had m s lnng the property And vv hen our far-
mers recei.* Si'te bank notes, especially notes on
d s ant State banKo, and come to settle with their
nvrehants, the farmeis must s.ibm t to a discount
or h «s, hecau e thece notes are not at par at the
j 'ace« wh-vpt   *o ds wpr" fiist ppr"ha-ed Thus
a system of s/iatmg ind brokerage is introduced
alike vexatious and injurious to the people The
regaJai operations of business and exchange are
deranged, and distrust and confusion are the orders
ot the day Formerly we could, ior a h?If or one
per cent obtain cheeks and make remittances, to
almost every pa-t of the country Now you can
scarcely find any faeiht es of the kind, and when
you do, you must pay tnree or four times as much
to ava 1 yourself of them One line of trade ex-
lends from the Gulf of Mexico, through the heart
of the country, to the .Atlantic , and nothing can or
ought to satisfy us but a sound cm rency, eoually
good > t the centre and both extremes of our com-
m«.c •>! operations No administration of the Gen-
eral Government can be popular with us for any
length of time, which does not furnish such a cur-
rency for tne people You may delude and deceive
the nation for a while, through the instrumentality
of a pensioned and a corrupt prpss ed tors and of-
fice holders, tinder the influence of Executive pat-
ronage, judging of others by the rules applicable to
themselves, may continue to pour out their vials of
w r^th and slander upon the purest and best m n of
the country , th y may impute unvv orlhy motives,
aid ciiarge bnbery upon them for sustaining the
former Pank of the Un ted States, but, sir, unless
1  am gieat'y mistaken, the good seme of the nation
will ultimately get over the prejudices and alarms
e\utcd bv such base means, and then, and not be-
Í re, will the voice cf reason and patriotism be list-
ened to in favoi of establishing a national bank.
When that time arrives, existing evils can and will
be cured by a national bank, with proper guards in
its charter to prevent mischief I do not disguise
ni} opin.on that such a bank i¡> the only practicable
remedj , but it is us"less for mc to propose it now.
It would be a waste of t me to discuss the propriety
of establishing suca an institution, orto point out
the alterations I should propose m the late charier
ol the United States Bank, when I know that the
President has the power and disposition to defeat
any measure in regard toa national bank which
Congress might adopt
In locking back upon the tricks and artifices of
scurvy politicians, by which the people have been
deceived, and induced to overturn some of the best
and longest-tried measures of their Government, I
have deeply la mentedla infatuation which prevail-
ed    But whin I behold a manifes* disposmo
