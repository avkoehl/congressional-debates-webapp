HEADQUARTERS EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, December 30, 1862

Colonel W. G. ELY,

Commanding Forces on Road to Monocacy:

Unless some emergency requires in your discretion a different arrangement you will stop with your Connecticut troops at Mount Airy and Monrovia, holding the crossings of the road, and Colonel Ketcham will proceed with the rest of the command to Monocacy Bridge, to report to Colonel Truex. You will be guided by the information you obtain as to leaving detachments at any other crossing beyond Elysville. But if you hear of the enemy on the road, your dispositions and movements will,of course, be modified by that intelligence.

DONN PIATT,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Send immediately, from the forces at your command all cavalry that you can possibly spare, and a battery of artillery, in pursuit of Stuart, who is reported as crossing at Harrison's Island at 10.45 this morning. Galligher's cavalry has no carbines, and are without artillery.

Colonel W. S. TRUEX,

Commanding at Monocacy Bridge:

The rebel cavalry may strike the railroad at or near New Market, and attempt to pass around to Frederick on the north. You will keep a lookout also in that direction. I have ordered a regiment of infantry, and the other two sections of Chalfin's battery, up the railroad from here.
