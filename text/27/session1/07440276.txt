the most vital interests of the community depend on
its proper administration, Our present system of
national banking is, however, replete with errors;
which, it is to be hoped, the Legislature will, m
course of time, remove. The evils to which we
allude axe in the conflicting motives between public
and private advantage, which it cannot be denied
must more or less exist m the minds of those who
have the direction of the banks of England and
Ireland, In both countries they are for die most
part influential, wealthy men, who carry on private
operations on an extensive scale, and to whom,
therefore, the rise or fall m the value oí commodi-
ties is a most material consideration "
The Dublin Pilot, m one of its recent numbers,
remarks that "Mr. O'Connell told a story, at a late
meeting, of the tyrant Procrustes, who invented an
iron bed of that peculiar construction that it could
be extended if the condemned victim to be placed
upon it were shorter than others, and, if longer,
the legs of the victim were cut off The twenty-
four gentlemen who manage the Bank of England,
and the fifteen gentlemen who manage the Irish
concern, conduct them just as Procrustes con-
ducted the iron bed When rbey want commodi-
ties cheapened, they can chop off the legs of the cir-
culation, and then ' money is scarce' and ' times are
bad.' And when they want to raise prices, they
stretch out the paper issues to extraordmai y dimen-
sions; prices rise, money is plenty , and while all
is apparently smooth, these favored gentlemen
monopolists, or some of them, as we have already
shown, may 'sell out' "
Mr Hume lemarked, in the course ol a speech
delivered in the British Parliament, " that the Bank
of England, by lending money at times at low inter-
est—often lower than ike market price—on stocks and
other securities, did mieality urge toolei speculation
by merchants, and to over-issues of papi/ by join I
stock banks; and, having got the country into gteat
excitement of high prices and apparent prosperity,
altered their plan when their coffers we re empty
ing, reduced their discounts, raised the interest, and,
to prevent the exhaustion of their bullion, suddenly
cramped the whole of t/ie commeicial transactions- oj
the country "
After this airay of testimony against the action
of the Bank of England, I hope gentlemen will not
persist in holding that institution up as i fit model
for our imitation To reason by analogy, is usually
fallacious, but between our condition ind thtt of
Great Britain, there is no similitude which will
warrant us in drawing precedents from that Gov
ernment, for, m that great empire, we find three
national banks There are the Batiks ol England,
of Ireland, and of Scotland. She hasthice cential
points of trade, with a bank in each
Again on viewing the condition of this country,
we find tnat even m those States where it is conced'
ed that a single bank would furnish a bitter cum
lating medium than a plurality of them, such is
the competition between rival points, and such the
demand lor equal commercial lacilittes, that each
town and hamlet must be accommodated with a
bank. While, therefore, a single State institution
might afford the best currency, yet experience
proves beyond a doubt that it would hive a ton
trolling and centralizing effect on the commerce oí
a State If a variety of banks be necessary to
equalize commercial facilities, and to lender equal
justice to all patts of a Stale,—if Great Britain is
induced to countenance three distinct banks tor
her several centies of trade, and not to rely upon
one bank for the entire empire—then Ijmuttogen
tlemen to prove the propriety 01 soundness ot the
policy they now propose to loree on the country
Either our State Governments, along v nh Great
Britain, are wrong in having a plurality of banks
or the scheme of establishing one on' for the
whole Union is unwise,—too centrali7in^ and pow
erful m its fiscal and commer lal tenden íes to be
trusted to the management of any set o' men, were
they even subjected to responsibilities of the highest -
character
If wisdom is to be gatherej from the experience
of Great Britain, or from our own State s, it ought
to satisfy us that a national bank would h_ie the
worst possible effect on the commerce 11 the toun
try, and lend to make each little trading c immunity
tributary to the great ioeus from which all oí the
principal financial and commercial facilities and
transactions would radiate into all quarn is of the
confederacy, but to return burdened wi h accumu-
lated treasures, filched from the honest in Justry of
distant sections.
As illustrative of this view of the tendency of a
federal bank on southern trade, let me invite your
attention to a few lines in an able report presented
by the Hon Francis Mallory to the commercial
convention of Virginia m 1838 The report states
that" the first national bank was incorporated in
1791, with a capital of $10,000,000 The mother
bank was located m Philadelphia, with branches
in the principal cities In the distribution of the
capital, 14,700,000 was allotted to the mother bank,
$700,000 to the bank in Boston , $1,800,000 to that
at New York, $600,000 to Baltimore, $500,000 to
Norfolk, $600,000 to Charleston, to Savannah
$500,000, to New Orleans $300,000, and $200,000
to the District of Columbia «íving but $2,800,000
to the staple States, and $7,200,000 to the others—
and that, too, at a period when the tiade of each sec-
lion was about equal We find that the exports oí
New York in four years from the passage of the
law creating it, and when its influence began to be
felt, had inaeased from $2,505,465 in 1791, to
$10,304,581 mI795, Pennsylvania,during the same
period, irom $3,436,093 to $11,518,092, while Vir-
gima, under its influence, had advanced from
$3,131,865 to «3,490,041, with a rapidly declining
import trade We have already noted the sudden
increase of the exportations ot New York and Penn-
sylvania over Virginia, so soon as the old bank
went into full operation, viz from three to ten mil
lions They continued to increase as the business
of that institution progressed and other banks mul-
tiplied, until they reached in New York $26,357,000,
in 1807—Virginia remaimngnearlystationary, her
exports that yeai being 84,761,000 A large por-
tion of these exports from New York was, as above
stated, ol foreign products, and of twenty six mil-
lions, $9,957,000 was of American growth—Vir-
ginia having that year expoited out of $4,760,000,
on'j $368,000, and thus, while New York was de
riving the profits of trade of sixteen millions of ex-
ports, Virginia reaped the bounty on a trade only
of S.368,0001 In 1811, the bank expu ed and how
was it then' New York was reduced to $12,266,000,
(foreign and domestic,) Virginia still remaining
the same, viz $1,822,000 In 1812,1813,1814, and
1S15, li acle « as interrupted by the war, and there
being no United States Bank during that period,
let us then ¿ec how trade started with each Stale ie
hung on its owi tesouices, without a tanff or bank
Thus, in 1816, New York exported $19,690,000, of
which, American produce amounted to $14,168,000.
Inthat year, Vitginn exported f 8,212,00 ',of which,
$8,115,000 w is pioduced at home We'l, the tariff
and banket) into operation , and what is the result i
In 1817, New York exports $18,698,000, and Vir-
ginia falls of $3,000,000 In the mean time the
bank gets into disorder, and was on the eve of bank-
ruptcy , and 1820 was a year of great distress and
embarrassment Domestic produce shipped Irom
New York that 3 ear is only $8,250,000,—a 1 educ-
tion oí five millions fiom the domestic exportation
of 1817, and Virginia sti'l continues stationary—
herdeeieo.se not amounting to $500,000 In 1821
the bank- began to levive, and from that period
up to this, we have accurate official returns of both
exports and imports That year, New York im-
poned $23,629,000, Viigima,$1,078,000 Another
lanfflaw is pissed 111 1824, and the United States
Bank is well under way. We find, then, that m
1825, only one year al'tei its passage, New Yorff
imports were $49,639,000, Virginia only $553,000,
and one year after the tariff of 1828, vihich, as we
have -aid, gave the finishing stioke, Virginia ím
poitations had fallen off to $375 000 This being,
too, when the operations oí the United States Bank
were m<st crlensne and successful, a coincidence
loo remarkable to need comment <"

mon sense lepudiatethe idea, and demand a more
efficient and tangible regulator Shall the bank
aberrations of the States be pleaded as an excuse to
swerve this Government from its propriety or in
ulceus, hke crazy charla'ans, to attempt to cure
one blunder by committing another'' I hope this
House will see the folly of augmenting the bank
mania, and discard the bill now before them To
guai d the people from a deranged paper currency,
by incorporating a mammoth paper establishment
111 this District, is about as wise as turning the lion
m the sheepfold to protect them against the wolves
The remedy for the present disordered state of the
currency must be found in a system anlagonistical
to our paper currency Let honorable gentlemen
bear in mind that we are called on to legislate for
the producing and consuming classes, and not espe-
cially to enact laws to aggrandize the stock jobbers,
bank men, and paper-shavers The yeomanry of
the country want a sound and substantial currency ,
the speculators and capitalists demand bank mono-
polies to enable them to subsidize the mercenary
and extort tribute from the working classes, and,
finally, to lord it over both the Government and the
people You are called on one side by the capital-
ists, to enable them to veufy the remark of a dis-
tinguished man, that " incorporated -wealth is the
dynasty of modern States ," and, on the other hand,
the sturdy yeomanry require at your hands 'the
constitutional money at home, and the legal cur-
rency all over the world "
Most candid men of both political parties admit
that \\ e have too little specie in circulation Now,
when it is proposed to mtuse a larger amount into
the general operations of commerce, by confining
the Federal Government to the constitutional cur-
rency, gentlemen, if they do not scout the idea, at
least take the best course to defeat its accomplish-
ment Stability m the currency is all-important,
and the nearer you approximate the specie standard,
the more certain are you to secure that desirable
object In corroboration of my opinions on this
deeply interesting subject, I beg leave to recite a
few remarks from several distinguished sources
High authorities should be more frequently lied
on, in lieu of the crudities now so much the lashion
of the day If gentlemen would give more frequent
evidence of their information on this subject, we
should, in all likelihood, have escaped many of the
fallacies of the paper system, notwithstanding the
stale arguments against hard money and in favor of
an exclusive paper currency As soon as it is pro
posed to augment the quantity of gold and silver in
circulation, out comes the senseless cry that" he is
against all banks, and is a real hard-money man "
But is not the converse of this proposition much
more frequently true t Surely the advocates of an
increased specie cuculalion can with much more
propriety charge their opponents with being friendly
to an exclusive papel currenc) Of the two ex-
tremes, which think vou the country would prefer—
the eidiie haul money system, or an exclusive cur-
«ency of iri edeemable bank paper'! Can any rational
man doubt that the former would be prefeired 1
It is just as fair when we hear any gentleman ridi-
culing a gold and silver currency to -tigmatize him
as being friendly to an irredeemable bank paper
circulation, as for the bank men to pronounce all
those who are for confining the Federal Government
to hard money, the unconditional enemies of all
banks, both State and national
Mr A Gallatin (a whig) m 1831 remarked, that
"it is of primary impoitance that the commodity
or substitute which may be selected for that pur
pose should be of a value as permanent as practica-
ble, and the same in every part of the same coun-
try, and it is also highly desirable that the same
circulating medium should be common to all coun-
tries connected by commerce Gold and silver are
the only substances which have been, and continue
tobe, the universal currency of civilized nations "
In speaking of the currency ol Fiance, the same
author sa}s "In France, where great pains have
been taken to ascertain the facts, as far as it ísprac-
ticable, mne tenths, at least, of the currency, eon
sists of the precious metals "           *            *            *
" We believe that the total amount of currency in
Europe and America may be estimated at two
thousand to tu 0 thousand three hundred millions of
dollars, three fourths of which consists of the pre-
cwusmetah, and the residueof bank notes " * *
" In countries where no artificial substitute has
rendered the task more diffit ult, and where specie
is the sole 01 principal currency, although there
maybe occasional varieties in its ^alue, they are
of rare occurrence, and 1 estramed w ithin narrow
limits, and an actual want of specie is hardly ever
known" * « * " The substitution of
bank-paper currency to the precious metals does
not appear to be attended with any other substantial
advantage than its cheapness " * * * *
'\We cannot conceal from ourselves that specie-
paying banks are not only exposed to extraordinary
diains from abroad, but are also occasionally con-
ti oiled by moral causes, the effect of which canpot
be calculated, nor without great skill and discretion
