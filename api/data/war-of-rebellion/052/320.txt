General BUCKLAND,

Please send an officer and a small party to Roach's and to Haynes' Bluff along the valley road and back to your post by Mrs. Neely's, and report the condition of things generally, especially at Roach's. I suppose you have the horses, mules, &amp;c., necessary to mount a patrol. Please report generally from time to time the appearance and condition of things in your neighborhood.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Asst. Adjut. General, Dept. of the Tennessee, Vicksburg, Miss.:

SIR: Have just heard from Steele. Enemy has been driven across Bayou Metarie by our cavalry. Kirby Smith means to make a stand there. He proposes to defend Texas at Little Rock. I have repeatedly stated that I think Steele needs, 5,000 men. I have not got them. Stevenson's division now at Monroe, if added to him, would make the movement complete. I have informed General Schofield and General Halleck of the necessities.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
