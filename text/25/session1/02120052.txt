RepoH of a Commute?
"Whereas, a number ot the patriotic citizens of
Pennsylvania have ccmmunicaied to Congress a
liberal offer, on their own crtdit, and by tiieir own
exertions, to supply and transport ihree millions of
rations , and three hundred hogsheads of rum, for
the use ol the arm}, and have established a Dank
for the sole purpose of obtaining and transporting
the said si pphes with the greater facility and de-
spatch, and-whereas on the one hand, the asso-
ciates, animated to this laudable exertion by a de-
sne to relieve the public necessities, mean not to
derive Oom it the least pecuniar} advantage, so,
on tl e other, it is jusv and reasonable that they
should be fully reimbuised and in lemnified, There
fore, Resolved, That Congress entertain a high
sense of the liberal offer of the said associators to
raise and transport the before mentioned supplies
for the army, and do accept the same as a distin-
guished proof of their patriotism Resoked, fui llier,
That the faith of the United States be, and the same
hereby is, pledged, to the subscribers to 'he said
bank, for their effectual reimbursemeni in the pre-
mises."
Such is the recent and humble origin of banking
in this country How gigantic has been its pro-
gress «mee that day' It is now the predominating
power in our America Great as it now is, w hat
mus it be in a tew 5 ears more, if it c< ntmues
grown g and c \pand nj at the saire rate? What
m"st it I e 11 a Itw }ea s, 1/ it succtels n w m
this couest with the Fedeial Government, anl lm
poses lis paper currency upon the Fedeial Trea
Miry, and continues to be the 1 eeper of ihe public
moneys? The administration is accused of making
■war upon the local banks Was it wai to give
them forty mdliors of money to keep? Was it
war to icceive thtn notes in payment of revenue''
Tí it w ar now tn giv e them time foi the paj ment of
b i a ires? Is it war upon them to ask to be sepa-
rated from them7 Is divoice war? Is it -«ar to
decline r ~eivmg their paper promises instead of

let it be perpetual, the baril s si}, no' Receive us
again; receive us before wt reform, before we re-
pent, before we make amends and if jou do not
it is •war upon ¡,s Tl is is the state of the contest
between the Government and Ihe banks It is at-
tack, or, at all events foi cible embrace and uni-
junction on their part, it is defence and refusal on
ours
The Presdent,, in his Message, recommends
four things, first, to discontinue the reception of
local bank paper >n payment of federal dues,
s enmhy, to d src'tinn'1 t^c same banks as deposi-
k r es of the publ 1 monevs, faulty, to make the
future crllectmn and disbursement of the public
monejs in gold and silvei, fomllily, to take the
keeping of the public mone} s into the hands of our
own officers
What is there 111 this but a return to the words
and meaning of the Constitution, and a conformity
to die piactice of the Government in the fhst vears
of President Washington's administration? When
this Tedera1 Government was first formed, there
vv as no Bank of the Tinned States, and no local
banks except three noith of the Potomac By the
act of 1789, the revenues were directed to be col-
lected m gold and stiver com oniy," and it was
usuall} drawn out of the hands ol collector  by dtatts
drawn upon them, payable at sieht It was a most
effectual waj 0' draw ing money out of their hands,
far more so than an ordei to deposite m banks, for
the diaft must be paid, or protested, at sight, while
the ordci to deposite may be eluded under various
pretexts
The right, and the obligation of tne Government
to keep its own moneys in its own hands, íesults
fr<m fir-.t principles, and fiom the gitat law of
self preservation Eveiy thing else tha ibelongs
to her, she keeps herself, and why not keep that
also, without winch, every thing else is nothing
Aims and ships—provisions, munitions, and sup-
plies of eveiy kind—are kept in the hands of Go-
vt rnment officers, money is the smew of war, and
w hy leave this smew exposed to he cut by any
careless or faithless hand? Money is the support
and existew e of the Gov ernment, the breath of its
nostrils, und why leave this suppoit, this breath, to
the custody of those over whom we have no con-
tiol? How absurd to place our ships, our arms,
t ur military and naval supplies in the hands of
those who could lefuse to deliver them when re-
quest d, an I put ihe Gov ernmert to a suit *>t law
toreccvei their po sissu n? Fvery body sees the
absmdity of this but to place our money in the
same condition, and moreover to sill jCct it to the
vicissitudes of trade, and the penis of banking, is
still more absurd lor it is the life h ood, without
which the Government cannot live—the oil, with-
out which no part of its machinery can move
England, with all her banks, trusts none of them
with the collection, keeping, and disbursement ot-
her public moneys The Bank of England is paid
a specific sum to manage the public debt, but the
revenue i^ collected and disbursed through subordi-
nate collectors ard iceeivers genera1, and these re-
covers genera] aie not subject to the bankrupt laws,
because die Government will not suffei its revenue
tobe ope iled upon bv any law cxeert l's ovv n v I
In trance, s boidinate collectors and receivers ge-
nei al collect, keep, and disburse the public mone}S
It they deposite any thing in banks, it is at their
own nsí It is the same thing in Fngland A
bank depos t  bv an officer is at the risk of himself
and In se 11 1 s Too much of the perils ard
vicissitude of hanking is known m tnese ciuntnes
to peimit the Gov ernment ever to leopard 's eve-
tnus 11 their keeping All this isshown, fully and
at large, 111 a public document now on 1 ur tables
And vvhc docs n t recognise in these '•ol'eciors and
írceivcis gen^nl of France and fngiand, the an-
cient Roman officers of qua^stois and pro qn¿e -
ttrs? These fiscal officers of Prarce and Eng-
land are derivations irom tne Roman institu-
tions, and the same are found in all the mo
dern 1 ingdoms of Furnpe which were for
mtrlv, like Frince and Britain provinces of the
Ron in Empire The measure before the Senate
is to enable us to provide for our future safet\, by
complying wilh our ow? Ccus-litt ion, and con-
forming to the practice of si! nations, great 01 smil!,
ancient or modern
Coming nearer horre and looking into our own
eailv histiri, what were the "(oihnental Trea-
sums'" if the Confederation, and the "provincial
Treasnreis mil Goi/eciors," provided for as early as
July, 1775, hut an lmiiatun of the French and
English s}stems, and very near the plan which we
propose nov/ to re establish These Continental
Tieasurers, and there weie two of them at first,
though aftei wards reduced to one, weie the Receiv-
ers General, the piovmcial treasurers and eollec-
tois were tl eir subordinates By these officers the
public mone} s were collected, kept and disbursed
for there were no banks then1 and all Government
drafts weie drawn directly upon these officers
This simple plan worked well during the Re-
volution, and afterwards, until the new Govern-
ment was *brmeJ, and continued to work, with a
mere change of names and forms, during the first
years of Washington's administration, and until
Gen Hamilton s bank m?cmnery got into play.
Thisbill only proptosesto re establish,m substance,
the system of the Revolution, of the Congress of
ihe confedeiation, and of the first years of Wash-
ington's administration
The bill reported by the chairman of the
Committee on Finance (JVfi Viright of New
Itork) presents the details of the plan for accom-
plishing this gieat íesuU That bill has been
punted and read Its simpliutv, economy, and
eliciency strike the sense of all w ho hear it, and
annihi ate without argument, the most formidable
aiguments of expense and patronage, which had
been conceived aginst it The present officers, the
present mints and one or two more mints in the
Souih, in the West, and in the North, complete the
plan There will be no necessity to carry masses
of hard money from one quaiter of the Union to
another Government drafts will make the transfer
without mov ing a dollar A Government draft
upon a national mint, will be the highest order of
bills of exchange Money wanted by the Govern-
ment in one place, will be exchanged, through
meichants, for money in another place Thus it
ha« been for thousan Is of } ears, and will for ever
be We read in Cicero's letters that, when he was
Governor of Cihcia, in Asia Minor, he directed his
Qjuastoi to deposite the tribu'e of the provine in
Antioch, and exchange it foi money 111 Rome with
merchants engaged in the Onental trade, of which
Antioch was one of the emporiums This is the
natural cours" ot things, and is too obvious to re-
quire explanation, or to ?dmit of comment
The Senator fiom Virginia, who sits over the
wav, (Mr Rives) to w hose very able speech I lis-
tened With great attention, and certainly with in-
struction on sev eral points, has brought in a bill,
antagomstical to the plan of the Government, and
going to continue the receivability of local bank
papei, and the deposite of the pibhe money 1 with
the local banks It is the same bill, with some
moimcations, which he brought m last winter, and
which it w as mv fortune then 10 oppose To speak
against the bill of that Senator now, would be to
repeat the numerous speeches w mch I then made,
rein'orced by the experience of the last four months,
an expeiíence compicssmg into a few months, the
e rents cf an age an experience surpassing all that
I th n a eaded, an experience transcending all
argument ai d throw ng the public m nd a century
ahead I do not 1 sign to repeat what I then said
on the Seriat "N phn wherein it remains unaltered,
but there is a featuie n it to which I marh objected
then, and which I fiid mole objeitionable now,
from ihe mod fc in U I as nrdeigone I allude
to the condmons t i which the no es of the local
banks were to beieceived, and which, in rry opi-
nion, amounted to a compact with the banks, and a
compact of the mo4disadvantageous kind to the
Government That fea ure is continued, and ag-
grava ed by taking the form whi-h may enable a
few strong banks to monopolize the business of
furnishing paper currency to the Federal Govern-
ment     This is w hat I tl en said
" In the next place, he (Mr Benton) objected to
the committee's bill because it proposed to make a
bargain with each of the thousand banks now in the
United States and the hundí ed < more w hich wnl soon
be b >rn, and to gn e them a right—a right by law—
to have their notes íeceived at the Federal Trea-
surv He w ?s against such a bargain He had
ro idea of making a contract with these thousand
banks foi the reception of then notes He had no
idea of contracting with them, and giving them a
right to plead the contract clause of the Constitu-
tion against us, if, at an} time, after having agreed
to receive their notes upon condition that they
would give up their small circulation, they should
choose to say we had lmpaued the contiact by not
continuing to íeceive them, and so, either relays?
