August 25.-10 a. m., directed the movements of this corps to take place to-night as follows, in "Orders of the day for the Fourth Army Corps":*

6.45 p. m., Opdycke's brigade marched over to General Newton's division, and immediately afterward the three divisions of the corps commenced to withdraw. By 10 p. m. all of the troops had been withdrawn from the main line of works and were on the march for Proctor's Creek, moving around the Twentieth Corps. Our pickets were successfully withdrawn at about 11 p. m. without being observed by the enemy. 11.25 p. m., the head of our column (Kimball's division) reached Proctor's Creek. Only part of this division came up in time, as there was a break in the Second Brigade, causing an interval in our line of march of about one mile and a half. It is said by officers who were where the break occurred that this was caused by some of General Geary's division (Twentieth Corps) passing through our column. This caused a delay, and the rear of our column didn't get to Proctor's Creek until daybreak. It was closely followed by the skirmish line. Generals Newton's and Wood's divisions were posted on the high ridge on the north side of the creek, and General Kimball's division was posted on a hill near to and on the south side of the creek. After daylight the enemy's skirmishers followed us up and opened a brisk skirmish with the skirmishers of the Second and Third Divisions on the north side of the creek. Verbal orders were received from General Thomas to withdraw from Proctor's Creek (if the enemy did not attack) at 8 a. m. to-morrow and march for Utoy Post-Office, on the south side of Utoy Creek. These orders were given to Major-General Stanely this evening. Day very hot; heavy rain-storm in the afternoon. The rain made the roads very heavy, and it was hard for the troops to move over them. We lost a few men by capture, men who fell behind in the march to-night.

August 26.-9 a. m., the enemy did not attack us this morning, only engaging our skirmishers, and at this hour we commenced to withdraw our troops. Newton's division was withdrawn to the south side of the creek and Wood's division followed him, and after these divisions had passed him on the march to Utoy Creek Kimball followed with his division. 3 p. m., the head of our column (Newton's division) reached Utoy Creek, crossed it, and went into line of battle on the ridge on the south side thereof, the lien facing north. 4.30 p. m., Wood's division reached Utoy Creek, crossed, and went into line of battle, his right joining Newton's left, and his right and Newton's left both resting on the Sandtown road. 5 p. m., Kimball's of Newton's and Wood's divisions. Established headquarters near the Widow Kennedy's, or Utoy Post-Office. 10.45 p. m., received orders from Major-General Thomas to march to-morrow to Mount Gilead Church, starting at 8 a. m., and to move over a road running directly south to said point from the Widow Kennedy's. The church (Mount Gilead) is on the north side of and near to Camp Creek, about sixteen miles from Atlanta and four miles from the Atlanta and West Point Railroad. The Army of the Tennessee is passing around our left (as we face north) to-night, and it will move parallel with us, on our right, to-morrow, when we will face south and cross Camp Creek. Day very hot. Heavy showers through the day.
