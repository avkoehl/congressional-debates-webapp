HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, November 22, 1862.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

According to Granger's last return, he had, all told, about 15,000 men to resist Kirby Smith. I telegraphed Boyle's report to Granger yesterday, and in reply he says he has no confidence in the report. I will keep you advised of any movement. Previous reports put both Smith and Bragg at Chattanooga. Orders about wood on the railroad have been given to Boyle.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 22, 1862.

Major-General HORATIO G. WRIGHT,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

I have some spending fighting Kentucky regiments, which would be benefitted by being stationed in Kentucky, in order to recruit. I have sent two, the Fifteenth and Twenty-sixth, to Bowling Green. If you will exchange me some at Munfordville, I will send two or three of these as escorts, and those from Munfordville must come down as escorts. Bruce is a good man for Bowling Green. I shall put Paine in command at Gallatin, and assign Granger to a command in the field.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, November 23, 1862.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I shall be very glad to exchange the entire brigade at Munfordville for an equal number of Kentucky or old Indiana regiments. Please send the for regiments there as soon as practicable, and the exchange regiments will be held ready to report as you may dictate.

Will attend to the case of the Fourth Kentucky.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, November 23, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

It will deprive me of the use of those regiments to let you use them. They will be wanted by the time they get there, if not sooner. Wish it were otherwise.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
