PONY MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION,

December 6, 1863-9 a.m.

Captain NORTON:

Had a fine view of the river at sunrise this morning. Do not tsee a large force of the enemy on this side of the river at any of the fords. Camp smokes have increased back of Raccoon Ford. See no movements of the enemy on any of the roads leading to the Blue Ridge. No camp smokes at or near Madison Court-House. The enemy appear to occupy their old positions, with a little heavier force opposite the fords than heretofore.

CASTLE,

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

The enemy's force seems to gradually increase between Morton's and Stringfellow's Fords. Can see large camps there now. All the fords up to Garnett's are well guarded. See quite large camps along the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, from Rapidan Station south. Have seen no demonstration on this side of the river to-day.

The reconnaissace toward Madison Court-House had got to Thoroughfare Mountain at 11.15 a.m. The officer reports he can see the entire country beyond Madison Court-House to below Clark's Mountain; a signal man with a glass is along. No considerable force of the enemy is this side Robertson's River, above. Camp fires indicate the enemy's position between Rapidan Station and Orange Court-House, as well as along the river below. No movement on our right or in contemplation that can be heard of. The reconnaissance will be pushed forward.
