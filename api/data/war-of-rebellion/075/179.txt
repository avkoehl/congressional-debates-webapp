HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,May 14, 1864-5 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: It was very late last night, or early this morning, before I was able to relieve General Johnston's division, owing to the difficulties in getting thorough the woods and finding the lines. Wood's (Third) brigade joins McPherson's left; Ward's on Wood's left, and connecting with Fourteenth Corps. General Ward reports the enemy at work all night with axes, fortifying in his front. There is considerable skirmish firing going on this morning. No report yet of cause.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

General Thomas wishes you to shell as rapidly as possible, as we are fighting two corps and two divisions. Howard has just gone in. Schofield was repulsed. Very heavy fighting yet.

Colonel WOOD:

COLONEL: Make your line as strong as you can to-night without making any noise about it to let the enemy know what we are doing. I want the line so fixed (without a noise to let the enemy know) that less troops can hold it.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

You can get some picks and spades of Captain Francis, division pioneer officer.
