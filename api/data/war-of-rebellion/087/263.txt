Numbers 21. Report of Bvt. Brigadier General George N. Macy, Twentieth Massachusetts Infantry, commanding First Brigade, of operations December 9-10.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, FIRST DIV., SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 12, 1864

MAJOR: I respectfully submit a report of the part taken by my command in the late reconnaissance across Hatcher's Run Ford:

Marched from camp, near Fort Fisher, at 6.30 a.m., 9th instant, down Vaughan road, preceded by cavalry. Met with no opposition until my skirmish line became engaged, near Hatcher's Run Ford, with the enemy posted behind a work on opposite side of the run. The run being deep and much obstructed by fallen trees, the skirmish line was compelled to halt. Being ordered to cross the stream, I formed two companies Second New York Heavy Artillery near the ford, under command of Captain Armes, supported by two other companies Second New York Heavy Artillery, under command of Lieutenant Bliss, the whole supported by the remaining eight companies Second New York Heavy Artillery, under command of Major Hogg. At a signal from Captain Brown's battery the assaulting party moved forward, under a sharp fire from the enemy, plunged into the stream, and a portion of them succeeded in gaining the opposite bank, the enemy flying at their approach. I would especially commend the gallantry of Major Hogg, who was the first to cross the run; also of Captain Armes and Lieutenant Bliss, who immediately followed Major Hogg. As fast as the troops could pass over they were formed by Captain Boyd, of my staff, behind the work holding the ford. I had directed Colonel Scott, with two companies Sixty-first New York Volunteers, to proceed ford, which was promptly done. Colonel Scott was then directed to send one company down the south bank of the run to a ford still
