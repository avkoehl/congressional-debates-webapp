2,7th C<me......lsT Sim.   .                                 Public Lands—Mr. Meriwether,                                                   H. of Reps
gance which marked the last Adrmriatrauon   Abit is, however,
the count! y will judge of the motives of both acts
While, however, I cannot commend the course of the gentle
man, nor approv  the sentiments h has advanced, 1 mii-t
accord to him credit for the candor with which he has avowed
his principies In refeience to the merits of the measure before
us, he has assumed the only position which can bo occupied m
opposition to it, upon principie, to escape the chaige of ei its
and wanton injustice to the States—a denial of any ttust lelult
log to the States, a denial that the United fe ate  Government
derived any title whatever to the lands from the deeds oí ees
sion, and the affirmation that all the tule which it pobses&es was
derived from the Federal Constitutor
[Mr Clifford here explained that he had said *uch wt re the
opinions of Messrs Clay and Web-itei, and he did not feel at
liberty to dissent from such hign authority
Mr Mbriwbther Then I asic the gentleman if he will affiim
or deny the truth of these positions'*
Mr Cciprofip here went into an explanation of some length
aa to his opinion , and the *eas ms for tho^e opn ions ]
Mr Meriwether resumed I do not see how the gentle
man's position is at all changed by the explanation lie as
aerts yet what I understood him to assert befoie If he would
not feel himselt at liberty to dissent fr>m «uch high authority,
hemustfeel himseli hound to assent to it fie did, m his ar
gument of yesterday, advert to the deeds of cesión in their
chronological order, and wlvm he came to the period oí time
at which the Constitution wa& adopted, read that clause on
which he relies, and concluded with the declarau n, as I un
deratood him, that the Constitution oveirode the dee Is of ces
aion, and cited the opinions of Me^is Cliy and Webstei to
sustain his positions
this tram of reasoning left no doubt on my t"i d as to wnat
were his opinions ihen, and his explaiatioi still co ifims my
convictions as to his principles I will nice the ib^ue as p e
sented by him, and ee whethei th* positni sa„sjmed can he
sust-in ^d by any pnnciple of national honoi, Vgit ma e cor
Btruction, or national f nth
The clause of the Constitution relied onto divert the State?
of their tule to the publí--IineU, anl to ve&t t fee sm e title
m the United States, mdopentlentofany trust fur the i e of the
States, is th*  following
"The Congress shall have power, to dispose of, and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting, the territory oi othei
pioperty belonging to  the United ¡states ,:
It is difficult to understand, even adoptng the most lautudi
nous Federal constiuctioi, how the delegation oí d power to
Cmgress "todispose oí" "thet rn ory;;be!ongmgto e United
States could be tortured into an mtenti in to change " a iy way,
either to enlarge or íestrict, the'bhaiactei of tufe which the
United States held to tnat terutoiy, how tne desie nation nfa
mare agency to perfrimai act could be ut derstood a^ ^mount
ing to the divesting of the title of the constituent and ves ing u
m that asent 1 h« powei to dispose of ' t  g ven and tli^ ter
ritory belonging to the I nited state  is thn subject mi iet of
disposition, but the power to appropmte the proceeds at will,
to any object, does not follow as a consequei ce Tne power
granted is a comprehensive one, it la true, but, in a at c<.n
strucuon of the the Constitution, ought we to gofuithei than is
necessary to give-effect to the power granted, consi&'ently wiih
preexisting rights, or siail we so cons ue it as to d^atroy
altogether all otner r ghta of the partita to the compact?,
Congiess has powei to'Say and collect tax^s, duties, imposts,
and excises, to pay the kbtsfSnd provide for the common de
fence and general welfaie o'"the United btates," but djeathis
confer upon Congress the power so to lay those tax^s, ¡iOi.w th
standing when collected to be appiopuaied to the purposes
designated, that one branch of nlusiy biioulJbe piocual to
the prostra ion of all others'* I apprehend not Undei this
clause we mighf as well assert the right to de^tioy all uher
"branches of mdustty fosteied by the te ates save oae, which
meet  our protection, as undej. thf ore cite 1 a tempt to deprive
the State3 of their right to the trust estate,becau«e Coneiess has
power to dispone of the terruoiy belonging to the Unued State*.
The Constitution speak1- of propeity of ownership to that pro
pertv,apdof contiol overit hut it nowhere speaks o a change of
tula to u,orof the particuiai charactei of the title t e United
Spates should DO-,&es¡s In its bioadest consti uetion it can mean
nothing more than tha the t°rri'orv belonging to the United
Saas, whether m fee si n pie or mtru^t, suouki be subject to th 3
power of Congress to meet the p irticular pu rposes for which the
estate waa cieated
If, however tule is deuve I ftom the Constituton to  hese
lands, where, I wo aid ask, is this tern oiy* Uy the term tei
ritory, we do not understand the geosria, hical lim ts oi the
United States, if so, then the tctiitory wit m the limit  of
«ach State would be subject to be deposed of hy Congiess but
the subsequent words of the Constitution, "or other propeity
b-lungng to the U in ed States," show tint such territory as be
longed to the Imite 1 states—-such as it had acqtm e 1 bv ce sion
or conquest—was the teuitory meant The Constitution fWes
no limit , points to no boundaries for duo teiutoiy When we
seek ibr us location we must go outside its piovis ons, to the
muniments of tule When wt turn to these, we fi id tei ritory
marked and d"hned, but coupled with its description, and inse

Now I ask, if the simple gimtof p>wer to depose of the
"terruoiy heionffUig to ti e i uttd States,' sanrtmned bv th 1
State of Virginia, can include the power to wiest horn the
States, Virginia included, this common fund, stipulated by

no othei use oi purpose whitcver,' and to vest it m the
United States Government to do with it as it please^ And
does it renát* void the deed, sa> e only as to the identity of pro-
perty? is thi« giant of power inconsistent with, and contra
dieted by, the detds or te^ioiYÍ Oí may t ot the grant an I the

I imghtiUubtratc this rule of construction by a vaiiety of ex

undei it, you have paid the debts of the Revolution, and the

have abmloned all their mtere&t intrust in the lands, and have
sunendered it up to u&, to do wuh the ( roceejsas we please X
a k, sir, in what faith can this Government thus addiesa the
^tateb'

Now,'he principle asserted by the Opposition i6*, thatthe
ti ie to this 1 tnd is derived from the Consutntion, and ihdtihe
deed of cession is only the foim by which to acknowledge the
existence of tf at title by the State cons qucntly no terms con-
tained m the deed are obligatory upon the Gcvermrent If it
candisiegaid 'hetiupt as pait consideration of the ee^ion, it
ianolikf disregard any other stipulation If it looks to the
Cor«-utution as thesouice of iu uHp it is boi nd te comply

thereof, w hy may it not di«iegard the pay ment of the $1,250 000,
