Colonel J. M. WARNER,

Commanding at Fort Reno, Tennallytown:

Who is Goldstein, who reports the enemy in force beyond Rockville? Have you been able to find Company K, One hundred and fiftieth Pennsylvania Volunteers? Has firing, and, if so, of what character, been heard in the direction of Rockville?

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT RENO, July 14, 1864. (Received 7 p. m.)

Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR:

This report sounds like it might be from the person I spoke to you of, a scout for Major Fry. The expression, "As much as I can find," I noticed yesterday was peculiar to him. This dispatch was brought here by a soldier. I do not put any reliance on it; it is not made official in any way by the officer in command of the cavalry on the Rockville road. The soldier who brought it was one of the First New Jersey Hussars. He said our cavalry was six miles beyond Rockville when he left, on the road to Edwards Ferry.
