SIR: I have the honor to inclose you a copy of a letter recently received from Major General J. G. Foster, U. S. Army; also a copy of a letter from Edward Stanly addressed to General Foster, and a copy of my reply to him.* As I may expect an answer from General Foster I should be pleased to know in advance if these negroes will be returned to their owners provided this Government will return those they have abducted. I have received several letters and have written him several touching the outrages that have been committed by his troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.

I hope my letter will meet your approval.

Throw into Wilmington the number sent before, say as we suppose, 5,000 men in all. Beyond that exercise your own judgment in contingencies. The Secretary has telegraphed to urge the additional transportation you desired in your late dispatch.
