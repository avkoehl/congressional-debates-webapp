HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 8, 1865-3. 45 p. m.

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington:

General Connor sends the following dispatch:

FORT KEARNY, May 7, 1865.

I most earnestly and respectfully request that no more of the Canadian ponies be sent me. They are utterly worthless and of no service in this district.

The 2,000 ponies ordered to be purchased for our use on the plains were to be good, substantial ones. It is reported to me instead of getting such horses they pick up young colts and broken-down ponies around Detroit. If better ones cannot be furnished please change the order to Colonel Potter and let him buy on the plains. He can gt much better ones there and save transportation.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General Elkin,

Chief of Cavalry Bureau, Washington:

The Canadian ponies or horses sent us are utterly worthless. We can purchase far better on the plains. Unless they can send us better ponies I think you had better authorize Colonel Potter to purchase them on the plains. That will save transportation. Those furnished us are nothing like those furnished General Sully. Please answer.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, May 8, 1865.

Major-General PLEASONTON:

General Connor telegraph that the Canadian ponies furnished us are utterly worthless and requests no more to be sent him. I telegraphed General Elkin the facts and requested that Colonel Potter be authorized to purchase ponies on the plains if better ones could not be furnished from Canada. Please advise him to this effect.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
