To hold Thomas in check I proposed that you should have, in addition to your present force, the cavalry of Hood's army and Polk's old corps. To this I hoped you would be able to add many reserves and militia, and did not see how more force could be given, unless troops are sent from the Trans-Mississippi, the call oft which has been reiterated.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

General Hood having applied to be relieved, the Secretary of War orders me to place you in command of this army. You will retain, also, command of your present department. Operator at Meridian will deliver this dispatch to General Taylor to-morrow morning on the cars from Mobile.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
