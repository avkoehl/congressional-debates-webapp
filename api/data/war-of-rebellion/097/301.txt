with nearly the whole corps and follow up any advantage gained, and if I am worsted I have a good place to reform on. This may seem a little slow, but it is the only way we can keep our troops working together and conduct operations with certainty. the amount of line I can occupy will depend upon the character of country I develop. The roads and field are getting too bad for artillery, and I do not believe General Sheridan can operate advantageously. If General Humphreys is able to straighten out his line between my right and the vicinity of the Crow house, he will hold it in pretty strong force, but the roads are so bad they alone will keep him nearly all day finding out how matters stand. The orders about the cavalry reporting to General Macy have been sent out.

Major-General WARREN:

General Ayres is now moving out to extend my line. If he meets more force with a mile than he can dispose of Crawford will go to his support, and I can also use a brigade from Griffin. If the enemy is outside of his line, or comes out, we shall have a considerable fight pretty soon.

Major-General.
