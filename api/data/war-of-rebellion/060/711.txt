better be retained for the present and until the infantry of your command are transferred. I write hurriedly, as the train is about due.

Very truly and respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The general commanding desired me to suggest that as there is no cavalry between Back Creek and Patterson's Creek, that section should be pretty thoroughly scouted, so that no attempt could, without your knowledge, be made against the railroad. I believe, though, he telegraphed this in effect during the evening.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, March 21, 1864.

Acting Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE:

I send inclosed a copy of statement* made to me by a reliable young man whom I sent to Hamilton, N. C., and who has just returned. I shall send a copy of the statement to the commanding officer at Plymouth, with directions to communicate it to the naval commander there. Why cannot we organize a little expedition to burn the iron-clad? It is only 20 miles from Plymouth.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, March 21, 1864.

Major General JOHN J. PECK,

Commanding District of North Carolina:

GENERAL: I send you a copy* of the latest and what I believe to be reliable information in regard to the iron-clad at Plymouth. I think if the navy cannot go up with their gun-boats and destroy it, that you had better organize a little expedition by land. A single regiment of cavalry would do it, and it is only four hours' ride. You have transportation enough in two days to get them to Portsmouth. How would it do to send up the Bombshell?

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
