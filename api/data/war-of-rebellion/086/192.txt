HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, Westport, Mo., October 22, 1864.

Major C. S. CHARLOT,Assistant Adjutant-General, or

Captain GEORGE S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy's camp-fires show at the present time for a distance of six miles, extending along the Big Blue. I think if we march out in the morning with cavalry and artillery we can completely rout them. We want long-range guns. There is no trouble in falling back with perfect safety. Their first line of fires is about two miles from my camp. I think Colonel Moonlight either marched to Shawnee Mission or to Kansas City. Where is General Blunt's headquarters?

C. R. JENNISON,

Colonel Fifteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, Commanding Brigade.

ON THE KANSAS LINE, TWO MILES SOUTH OF WESTPORT, [October 22, 1864]-Just dark.

Major-General CURTIS:

Colonel Jennison and myself flanked the enemy on the west, and have been fighting until now. We retreated to an open field, they following. We then turned and drove them about two miles. I am encamped on the ground. A prisoner just taken (Second Lieutenant Williams, of Jackman's brigade) says Price is encamped this side of Byram's Ford, with 28,000 men, all mounted; twenty pieces of artillery. We have been fighting Jackman's and Shelby's brigades. My men must eat, and they will fight. I cannot see any longer.

Respectfully,

MOONLIGHT,

Colonel.

SATURDAY, October 22, 1864-9 a. m.

General GRANT,

Commanding Militia, near Hickman Mills:

Price is making very feeble demonstrations in front. Look out for your position. Send scouts out on road toward Pleasant Hill, and also toward Independence, to see if Price is moving on my flank. Send me reports every thirty minutes.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Forks of Road, [October 22, 1864].

Brigadier-General GRANT:

A column of the enemy has been seen passing up the Blue on the opposite side, perhaps designing to cross below you. Jennison holds the Rock or Byram's Ford, and Moonlight holds the one at Hinkle's Ford. Look well to all sides of you.

S. R. CURTIS,Major-General.
