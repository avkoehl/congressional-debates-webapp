these supplies to continue his march to Front Royal. Men, engines, and tools have been dispatched to get the train on the track. Ord's division and Shields' Fourth Brigade are pushing along. I do not think the accident will delay us materially.

Major-general MCDOWELL,

Manassas Junction:

General Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg by 12 (noon) to-morrow. Try to have your force or the advance of it at Front Royal as soon.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Major-General Shields has just reported his arrival by rail at Rectortown and that his First Brigade is already there, the other two being close in its rear. The telegraph line is all uninjured. Four railroad cars, which had been abandoned, were picked up on the track, as well as some other articles of public property. A mile this side of Thoroughfare Gap there was found heap of, ruins, the remains of arms, accouterments, cooking utensils, &amp;c., burned on Monday evening by the cavalry under Geary. A building used as a railroad depot was burned by them at the same time. No enemy is to be found in that region, and none approached Rectortown until it had been abandoned by our troops, when a few straggling cavalry, finding no opposition, burned the bridges between Front Royal and Rectortown.

IRVIN MCDOWELL,

Major-General.

MANASSAS, May 29, 1862.

(Received 5.45 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Major-General Shields reported an accident on the railroad at Thoroughfare Gap which he feared could not be repaired under twenty-four hours, and that this would detain him nearly a day. I sent him the President's telegram, and he reports he will make such arrangements that will enable him to be in Front Royal before 12 o'clock m. to-morrow, with his other two brigades within 4 miles of the town by the same hour. Since then the locomotive and force sent from here have repaired the break in the road, and the trains are expected to move through to Rectortown without further hinderance. I have sent heavy trains to help Ord's division along, and learn it is making good progress. Bayard's brigade has arrived at Catlett's, and will march to-morrow for White Plains or Rectortown. Everything seems to be getting along well now, notwithstanding this morning's trouble.

IRVIN MCDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
