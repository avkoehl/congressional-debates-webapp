line, the holding of your corps in readiness to take part in the action, and particularly all available reserve free for the immediate support of Burnside, if necessary.

Major-General MEADE:

I send you a Richmond Whig of to-day. The enemy keep an officer stationed on the picket-line on my left to prevent desertion. Their right has kept perfectly quiet, except an occasional shot from their artillery.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 28, 1864-10.45 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that, by direction of the lieutenant-general commanding the armies, all artillery firing, except from field pieces, will cease until further orders, and the heavy pieces will be concealed from the view of the enemy.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to General Burnside.)
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 28, 1864-1.45 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Before the dispatch of the commanding general could be communicated to Colonel Pleasants the charges had all been placed, and the tamping had progressed so far that he deems it best to keep on, as the stopping at the present stage would not serve to keep the mine dry any more than if the tamping were finished, besides, the air in the mine is, for some reason, becoming very bad, so much so as to make it difficult for the men to work. He, as well as the miners, say the powder will keep dry for at least a week. Shall he keep on?

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 28, 1864.

Colonel LORING,

Inspector-General:

Let Pleasants finish the tamping, by 3 o'clock if possible.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
