Reports of Major Thomas F. Wright, Sixth California Infantry.

FORT HUMBOLDT, CAL., February 21, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from the headquarters of the District of Humboldt, dated February 17, 1864, I proceeded with Company C (Captain Buckley) from this post at 5 p. m. same day. The order for the movement was not received until aboutn 4 o'clock on the day of our arrival from San Francisco. Neither the baggage of the officers nor men had been obtained from the steamer.

The following morning after proceeding about two miles we came to the point where the Indians had come up from Dyer's onto the trail, and we were able to follow them without any trouble to Boynton's Prairie, a distance of thirteen miles from Arcata. Here they had left the trail. By the time the guide had tracked them to their camp of the previous night and back onto the trail it was too late to go any farther, and we were obliged to camp for the night. During the night it commenced to rain. On the morning of the 19th I, however, proceeded as far as the crossing of Mad River, a distance of six miles. This stream flows between abrupt, steep banks, is exceedingly rapid, and difficult to cross when high, and I deemed it prudent to wait until the rain should cease before crossing with my command.
