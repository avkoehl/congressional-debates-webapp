Mi McKEAN presented the pioceedwgs of an unusually
iaigp and re pectable meeting of the Demociits of the city and
county of Philadelphia, friendlv to the General Government,
and opposed to the Independent Tieasuiy bill as introduce d into
the Sf nate oi the United States by the Hon Silas Weight, on
which occisión Geneial Robeit Patteison piesided, aided by

Tohn N lyloi, James Goodman, and Morton Mt Michael, as Vice
President*
Mi MeK said he could not refrain, on this occasion, from
expre-wng his pude and pleasure in finding the couise he had
steadily pursued on the momentous question of the Sub
Treasuiy thus publicly appioved by such men, and he honestly
eoncuned in all the viewa of the meeting on the subject He
was personally acquainted with the most of them They weic
men of the highest moral and political standing, and patnaichs
of Democracy, who give healthful tone to public sentiment
He recognised among them the editor of the pipei which pub
lishes 'by authority" the laws of the Union, and all of the
electois five in numbei, belonging to the city and county of
Philadelphia who gave their votes one year since fot Mi Van
Burén and he believed that was the only instance m wmch he
haddiffeiedfiom them politically Among othet things, they
< Revived, That we meet thit> question openly and fan ly,
without disguise and regai dies* nf all dictation  líe said
he was piea&ed with this as he liked to see men, who, conscious
ol their recti ude, stand firm and unwavering It would not do
(he said) ti denounce uch menas bank hnelmg&and austo
crats or weuiall soon leduce our Democratic foices too low
foi effective ^eivice He moved that the resolutions be lead,
printed   n 1 ldiJ on the tibie
Mi KINO ailed ii the gentleman from Pennsylvania was
not lead ins; from a newspaper
\Ii McKLAN íeplied that he had been reading a copy of the
proceo lings of this meeting, which had been cutout fioma
newspape and er closed to him m a letter by the Chairman
He hoped th«y would be lead, and the Senate would then see
what they weie                             ,          ,,         . ,                 „_,
Mr KIVG did not care about the leading of the papei What
he objected to, was the reception of such matters, coming in
the shape of a public newspaper It was not authentic enough
to be presented to the Senate, and it was not usual to leceive
papers of that character If it was the wish oí the parties
that these pioceedmgs should be piesented to the Senate, they
had nothing todo but to send their written account of them,
signed by their officers, and then they would be presen ed in a
i ¿sponsible mannei If said Mi K on the other hand, we
depart ñom this course, we shall be subjected to receiving aii
the newspapei controversies of the whole Union He did not
object to the íecep ion on account of the mattet contained in
the papei but to the character of the paper itself
Mr McKSANsaid, that though it was a copy cut from a
pubMc newspaper, vet its authenticity was touched foi bj the
le ter of the chairman, addressed to him
il>- KING said that the letter of the chairman did not alter
the character of the papei at all This was the mere account
cCa puolic meeting cut fiom a newspaper and sent here by the
Pieeident How was the Senate to know that the signatures
were genuine? Were the individual^ whoso names were prim-
ed in that papei, the persons who signed it There was no cer
tiflcate of this fact If, said Mr K we consent to íeccive pa
peis such as this we shall have the tables of the Senate
burtheneí with all the newspapei controveisies of the country
Mr PRESTON said he knew of no rule which compellt d the
proceedings tobe in the ongiaal manuscnpt oi that copies of
the proceedings of all great public meetings should not be for
warded by the people to then íepiesentatives m any fu m the)
might deem best Mr P was notawaie of what *hf pie cnbed
course was on such occasions, but he recollected instances
wheie memorials had been sent to he Vice President, and by
him presented to the Senate, which weie slips fiom nev\s,ja
pers The most respectful course would doubtless be, to send
original papers or certified copies In this case, the lettei was
the autograph of the chanman of the meeting, stating u to be
the memonal adopted at the time, and appended to it wa the
íesolution directing the pioceehnga to be sent to the P esule t
and Vice President of tne United State* and fo the i benator 
andRepiesentativesm Congiess and he wab persuaded there
could be no wellgrounded objection to its íeception
Mr BUCHANAN said that he had received a 'ettei, «ome
days ago, from General Patteison, ot Philadelphia leque^ting
him to prcent these proceedings to the foena e 3iy the bame
mail he had received a number of the Americin Sentinel con
taming the pioceedmgs He would mo&t cheerfuilv have pie
sentea them, a« published m that respectable j nunal, but on
consulting with members of the Senate who ha Í eeen here m
18--Í4,!when similai questions were raised, he was informed that
it would be a violation of the established practice < f the senate,
to pre ent them in a newspaper of the day líe had immedi
ately wnttento Geneial Patteison infoin inghtm oí this pi ic
tice, and suggesting that he should send the original oi a ceiti
fied copy oí the proceeding*., when they should be presented
with pleasure
Mi B was no sticklei foi forms He enteitained no doubt
but that the proceedings presented were a conect copy of the
ouginal He thought they ought to beieceived by the benate,
and hoped the Senator from Alabam i would withdraw hw op
position to then íeception It was at best hut a question ot
fotm,notof substance
Mr KING ob&eived that having exrmiued these \ apei&
moie fully h< would withdraw Ins objections ro then lecep

that the memorial be read, punted and Hid on the tabic
Mr WEBSTER observed that they had had rtrsrnted this
morning a senes ofiesolutions Horn a large and imposing meet
mgheldm thegreat city of Philaaelphn, remoivtratin against
the Independent Treasury bill, and thehonorable mem rre* f,om
New Yoik [Mr Tallmadge] now piesented the memorial of
8,000 citizens of the cuy ot New York ocaimt the same mea
su e The honorable membei suppose 1 that tins n emonal
and othet late movemeiits among the people had been caused
by a new born fear that thi*. measure, against which thej re
monstiate would pass Sir said Mr W I wish Ic llJsay
thatm my ludgment I have no such fears I say thatther^ ¿
great danger, and I knuwen-mgh of public affairs to piedict the
fate of a measure so important to the Administration, which
has been so long in agitation The members of both Houses had
been long from their constituents, u was three months since
they left then homes, and when they should come to give their
opinions, it would be three months more, so that theie would bo
six months intervening between then immediate connection
with their constituents and their voting on thismeasure Now,
undei such encumstances, he undeitook to aay that there was
great danger of the passage of this bill, unless it was arrested
by public opinion out of doors There is danger, said he, nñ
om s- de, and, on the side ofgentlemen gppoeedto us, hope and
confidence If these pioceedmgs indicated the alarm of people
out of doors he believed the alarm was well founded He
hoped that, instead of ti eating these memorials as fancies, gen
tlemen would paise, and «eiiously consider the matter they
contained But he learrd that thebe meetings would be re
presented as agents and tools of the bank and that the re
spec* ihle gentlemen who attended this great Philadelphia meet
in  would be iepieccnted as under the paw of the monster I
do pi ly gentlemen said Mr W (hat, laying aside all projects
and scheme0, they will do something to enable the banks to
íe&umespecie payments Without «aying moie, he earnestly
denied to draw the attention ofgentlemen to these memorials
The memoml was then lead
Mi Vv RIGÍIP said he should at this time as upon all former
occis uns, enter into one of these incidental morning debates,
aiisingupon the presentation of a petition, with extreme re
luctance Aftei theremaiksof hiocolleague fMr Tallmadgb,J
however and those which had lallen fiom the Senator from
Massachusetts, [Mi Webster,] he felt himself compelled to
enter his respectful dissent from the positmns taken by those
gent -.men lest hib silence might, by posstoilitv, be deemed an
assent to them
The petition was from the common constituents of his col
league and himself ItwasmimeiousJy signed, and he doubted
not the pctittoneis weie as íespectable as any other body of
citizens, of equal numbeis, who had addtessed Congress upon
this interesting sub|ect He was happy to see their exprés
«¡ions of opinion meet this marked attention from the Senate
These, like all the other citizens of the State, had a ng:ht to
claim for their opinions and ínteres s, the most íespectfuí and
laithful consideration of himself and his colleague From his
colleague they would ceitamly íeceive that attention, and it was
hi  firm determination that they should receive it from him
also He rejoiced that they possessed an equal right with
himself to speak here They had spoken, and they should be
faithfully and patiently listened to by him, and, so far as his
onvictions oí duty would permit, then wishes should be binding
upon him
^till t. could not be new to the Senate, or to his i expected col
It ígue anditceitdinly wi&not i ew to himself, now to learn that
theie weie many very many, among his constituents who dif
feiedfiom him, íadically, upon questions of political principie
and questions of political policy Thu> petition was but one oí
many proofs which had come before the Senate, since he had
been a membei of it to piove that fact It h d been his de
sien, upon all formei occasions, to treat such petitioners with
every íespect and to give to their opinions and wishes ever v
aid which principle and duty would permit The same de-
sign actuated him upon this occisión, and he must not, theie
ioie, in any thing he should say, be understood as indulging the
Janguaseof complaint oi conjure, bec°usc this respectable poi
tion nf hi  constituents had condemned m advance a measure
winch he had aided in bringing beiore the Senate, and the
adoption of which he consideiea essential to the best inteiests
oí the countrv On the contmy, he ctmiiended them for
then free explosions of opinion upoa this aid all othffi ereat
measures of national policy, and it was not t> make- a -¡¡ingle
icniaikm ¡elation to any thing embodied in the petition, lot
which he had nscn It wtó, as he had befjre stated, to ex
pies-* his dissent fiom the íemaikaof his colleague made upon
the pi esentation of the petition
His honoiable colleague had assumed in the broadest tei ns,
th it the piesent deiangement of business and distresses in the
luuntty iia 1 msen from the acts oí this Government Thi", in
his opinion, wasa mistaken assumption 1 he immediate cau eot
the derangement and distresset. was the piesent condition of the
banks ol the country, their inability to meet their obligations
and perform their chaitcred duties, in shoit, then universal eus
pension of specie payments Was there a member of this bo
dy was there a pei^on withm the hearing of his voice, who
would deny this piopositioiV He could notsupj ose theie wa= 
He Knew well however that there was a wide difference, at d a
great vane y of opinion about the causes which had produced
the suspension by the banks It was not now his intention to go
into that discussion He had, upon a formei occ ision, given to
the Senate briefly and partially his views- i pon íhatsul ect
and others had given thens lie was satisfied that the cauces
assigned upon all sides had had then irimence upon that ic ult,
bur m very unequal proportion^, and that any act" of any depart
ment of this Government, were among the secondaiv of those
causes All this, however, was not ver> material to his prest ¡¡t
purpose, which was to compare the declarations of the banks
and their fi tends at the time of the suspension, withsubsequei t
events and present representations
What was the immedia. e cause of the suspension as given bv
tie banks and bankeis at the time it took place? Not as <dl
will íecoliect the ulterior inability of the bank*! to pay t! e i
debts No, this wa^stienuousiy denied, and ti c banks declared
a perfectly sound and solvent as they had evci been butitwas
said thatwehadovei traded, had imported beyoi d thepioceeds
