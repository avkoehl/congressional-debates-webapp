No. 31. Reports of Brigadier General William T. Clark, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, of operations February 10 - March 13, and April 10-15.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, THIRD DIV., 15TH ARMY CORPS, Near Binaker's Ferry, February 10, 1865.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with instructions from division headquarters, I have the honor to report the following summary of operations of my command this day as directed by Special Orders, No. 40, headquarters Fifteenth Army Corps:

I moved from my camp at daylight this morning out upon the railroad about five miles toward Blackville, halting in rear of Second Brigade, First Division, whose line extended to the point where the railroad was already destroyed. My command then commenced the destruction of the road, burning every tie and twisting every rail for the distance of two miles and a half, with the exception of about fifty yards, in which interval the rails were not twisted, the command being ordered to move before that could be accomplished. I returned to camp upon receipt of orders at 2. 30 p. m., and thence moved my command to a point near Binnaker's Ferry, marching a distance of four miles.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. T. CLARK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain S. M. BUDLONG,

Asst. Adjt. General, Third Division, Fifteenth Army Corps.
