LEXINGTON, KY., November 17, 1864.

Colonel J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Burkesville, Ky.:

Move the Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry, mounted, and concentrate at Crab Orchard immediately. Each man should have 100 rounds of ammunition, 150 more should be carried in wagons. If you have not enough, make requisitions, and send officers round to draw and have ready.

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DANVILLE, KY., November 17, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington:

Following just received from Knoxville:

General Breckinridge whipped Gillem badly on the 13th and 14th, capturing his artillery, many horses and small-arms, and about 200 men. He is now attacking Strawberry Plains. There are some fears that an attack will be made on this place. Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn. Expect our communication to be cut daily. Will keep you posted.

W. L. GROSS,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

PULASKI, November 18, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

I have received no report from General Hatch this morning. His report yesterday indicated that Hood was about to move; but I think there is no probability of his moving this way while this weather continues.
