HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.20 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

What we thought was the heavy line of the enemy behind the line occupied by General Burnside's troops proves, as the sunlight comes out and the smoke clears away, to be our own troops in the enemy's position.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-6.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The signal officer reports that none of enemy's troops are visible in their works near the lead-works. The commanding general wishes if it is practicable that you make an attack in that direction. Prisoners say there are but three divisions in the works, and but one line of intrenchments thinly filled with their troops.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

A dispatch just going to Wilson to make a lodgment on the Weldon railroad and move up it to the enemy's right flank.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6.40 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have all my troops on my right except General Crawford's. I have sent him your dispatch, with directions to do whatever he can on the left with Baxter's brigade and half of Lyle's. Do you mean for me to move Ayres in that direction? The enemy have a 30-pounder battery on the main ridge in my front behind their first line. We cannot make out what this second line is.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-7 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

What about attacking the enemy's right flank near the lead-works with that part of your forces nearest to it?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
