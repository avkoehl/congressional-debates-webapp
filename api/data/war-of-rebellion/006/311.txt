Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

I have sent one regiment and one field battery to Charleston, and await such certain information of attack as will justice me in sending more troops under your instructions.

J. R. ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAVANNAH, November 8, 1861.

J. P. BENJAMIN:

The enemy has taken complete possession of Port Royal entrance and now controls the inland navigation at that point. I sent 1,000 men to re-enforce General Drayton on Hilton Head. They have returned to me with but few casualties, having been in the hottest of the fight.

A. R. LAWTON,

Brigadier-General.

COLUMBIA, November 8, 1861.

Honorable Mr. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

I telegraphed you this morning to ask for Gregg's regiment to report at Pocotaligo, but have no reply. Ripley is absent from Charleston. Telegraph me for Captain McCord's company to report. It is ready. A fine company just received for Hampton's Legion, but I armed it to-day to send to Beaufort. Do give me an order for Coit's company also. All our regiments are safe from Hilton Head and Bay Point. We must defend Charleston, and I have no arms for any more men, but have ordered out a large reserve to meet at Gillisonville or Pocotaligo. Let me know if Lee is in command, so I may order troops to him.

F. W. PICKENS.

COOSAWHATCHIE,

November 8, 1861 (via Pocatoligo).

General COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

Enemy attacked forts in Port Royal yesterday morning. After a hard cannonade silenced Fort Walker. General Drayton withdrew his troops last night to main line. No positive news from Bay Point, but the enemy have passed in and have possession of Port Royal. General Lee arrived.

R. S. RIPLEY.
