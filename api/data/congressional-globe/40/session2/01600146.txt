ness to lay before him several times.

the note I proposed sending to General Grant.
Question. I want to inquire a little further
about that. He did not agree to send that
notice, did he ?
Answer. When I first spoke to him about it
I told him what the mode of getting possession
of the papers was, to write a note to General
Grant to issue an order calling upon the heads
of bureaus, as they were military men, to send
to me communications designed either for the
President or the Secretary of War. That was
one mode.

the mails to be delivered from the city post
office.

to him about that order since?

the day he gave you that paper, when he was
going to support the Constitution and the laws,
down to to day, he never intimated to yon that
you were not appointed regularly as Secretary
of War, did he?
Answer. No.
Question. And that he had not appointed
you.
Answer. No.
Question. Nor none of the Cabinet, his con-
stitutional advisers say, "You are not ap-
pointed, General; you are only here by suffer-
ance?" None of them ever said that, did
they?
Ansioer. None of them ever said that to me.
Question. Tellus, if you can, what you meant

Ansioer. Why, to be governed by the Con-
stitution and the laws made in pursuance
thereof, of course.

have got my language.
_ Question. Has not the President given you
directions about other things than taking pos-
session of the War Office ?

sions what he wanted. He wanted to get some
nominations sent up here. They were on the

Answer. He did not get them.
Question. Well, he could not?
Answer. I do not say that.
Question. What did he tell you, whether he
could or could not get them?

could not. I could not get them.
Question. And he could not as far as you
know?
Ansioer. I do not know that lie could not.
Question. And he complained to you ?
Answer. He did not complain to me, but he
said that cases were lying over, and some of
them military cases, that ought to bo disposed
of. I mentioned it to Mr. Stanton twice that
the President wanted those nominations and
he said he would see to it. This was while I
was acting as Adjutant General, not as Secre-
tary of War.
By Mr. Stanbery:
Question. Did he send them to the Presi-
dent?
Ansioer. He did not, to my knowledge.
By Mr. Manager Butler :
Question. Now, at any other of these times,
when he has given you directions, has he ever
told you he was going to uphold the Constitu-
tion and the laws ?
Answer. No ; I think not.
Question. Did he ever tell you ho was going
to uphold the Constitution and the laws?

sation occurred between us.

of you should come to the conclusion that the
Constitution and the laws wanted upholding
about that time?
Answer. No.

stitution and the laws, or was about to hap-
pen, that required you both to uphold them?
Answer, 1 do not know that anything was
about to happen.
Question. Well, what had happened?
Answer. Nothing had happened.
Question. Why did he so solemnly tell you
there, upon this occasion, that he was going to
uphold the Constitution and laws, and why did
you say, " I will uphold the Constitution and
laws?"
Answer. Why, it was the most natural thing
in the world. He made the remark to me.
Question. Now, about Mr. Karsner, and I

where I was sitting.

there was anything that he said that was not
true?

answered yes.
Question. What did you say it was he said
that was not true ?
Answer. I think he testified here 
Question. No; there?
Answer. I do not know there. I am speak-
ing now of a portion of the testimony here.
Question. You told me you did not hear here,
and therafcrn I confine my question to what
occurred before the Managers. Keep your
mind, if you can, to the time when you were
before the Managers. Did you not sit down
before the Managers and there have Mr. Kars-
