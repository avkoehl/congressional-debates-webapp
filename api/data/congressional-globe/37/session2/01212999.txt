third, fourth, or fifth specifications of the first section of this
act, he shall have been engaged in armed rebellion against
the Governmentof the United States,after having received

above provided, and shall allege that he has been so engaged
under compulsion, he shall, in addition, state in his affida-

son held to service 01 labor, must prove to the satisfaction
of the court that the claimant did so engage in armed rebel-
lion, without the compulsion alleged, and on failure of such

claimant to take any affidavit above required, or to prove
the compulsion when it is alleged as an excusc, the court

proof (as the case may be) required by this section having
been exhibited by the claimant, the person so held to ser-
vice or labor shall be declated free, where, upon the weight
of evidence which shall be adduced, it shall satisfactorily
appeal to the couit that the claimant has belonged or doe's
belong to any of the six classes of persons specified in the
first scctiou of this act. Upon the hearing of this question
neither party shall be permitted to testify, and the court

eithci pariy and compel their attendance, and shall hear the
testimony of all witnesses, as well on behalf of the person
held to service or labor of the claimant; and the court shall
give cvfiiy person so declared free a certificate of the fact
under the &eal of the court; and such certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of the freedom of such person from all
service or labor against all persons whatsoever, and In ail
courts of the States or of the United Suites; and any per-

a legal and valid el mm to such service or labor, but also
make and file an affidavittluu he or they have not belonged

sales of the property formerly owned by rebels, and which
shall have been confiscated to the use of the United States.
Sec. 7. Jlml be it further enacted, That every peison em-
braced in any of the classes specified in section one of this
act shall forever hereafter be incapaple of holding or exer-
cising any office of honor, trust, or profit under the Govern-
ment of the United States.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. President, the motion
of the Senator from Illinois, if persisted in,will open
the debate we have had on confiscation, as well as
the whole question of emancipation. It is an un-
usual motion; perhaps strictly parliamentary, but
unusual. It seeks to substitute for a bill which
we have been discussing; for months another bill
ly:ng on the table. Now, if he will look a mo-
ment at the practical effect of his motion, I think
he will see that it will defeat his own object. The
Senator is certainly a friend of confiscation, and a
friend of the emancipation of the slaves of rebels.
If his proposition should be adopted, what would
b^the effect of it? You would send back to the
House as an amendment to a confiscation bill an-
other bill that has no reference to confiscation, but
to emancipation. You will be no nearer a con-
clusion upon any subject than you were when you
commenced; you will involve yourself in a dis-
pute with the House which, on its face, is an ab-
surdity. You reject one of their bills by sending
them another, which they have passed. It is an
absurd proposition.
Mr. President, I desire to secure the strongest
measure of confiscation that this Congress will
pass. So far as the emancipation of slaves is con-
cerned, I am probably far behind the great ma-
jority of my political friends. I do not look upon
immediate and general emancipation as a result to
be desired. If I had the power to emancipate all the
slaves in this country,I should hesitate very much
to do it until 1 had some provision for their gov-
ernment, for their education, for their protection,
and for their colonization. But upon the question
of confiscation, I have clear convictions that it is
our right and our duty to seize tho property of all
the leading rebels, and apply it for the use of the
Government in suppressing the rebellion. I there-
fore desire, by some practical proposition, to get
the largest measure of confiscation which the ma-
jority of this Senate and of the other House is
willing to extend. The bill that has been adopted
as an amendment is a bill which has been framed
by a select committee, and it has been considered
fully and fairly. It is not such a measure as 1
prefer. I have voted against it, and I shall con-
tinue to vote against it, as an amendment to the
House bill; but when it appears to be the strong-
est measure of confiscation a majority of this body
are willing to adopt, then I shall vote for it. It
contains many excellent provisions. Gentlemen
who favor other measures of confiscation are very
much mistaken if they say this bill now adopted
as an amendment will be nugatory. If they will
read it, and carefully examine it, they will see
that it will bo almost as effective a measure of
confiscation as any other, if the President of the
United States will perform what T conceive to be
his duty under it. It confers upon the President
of the tlnited States discretionary power to do all
and more than is required to be done under the
House bill; far more.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senatorcertainly has
not examined it. The bill that has been adopted
as an amendment does not forfeit the property of
a single officer in the rebel army.
Mr. CLARK. The Senator is entirely mis-
taken.
Mr. SHERMAN. The amendment that has
been adopted goes upon the principle which has
been thoroughly discussed here, that no property
shall be taken and confiscated finally until there
is a judicial trial. That is the basis on which it
is framed.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Oh, 110; it does not pro-
vide for a trial at all.
Mr. HOWARD. Did I understand the Senator
from Ohio propeily when I thought he remarked
that the property of no rebel was to be taken or
confiscated under the bill until there was a judicial
sentence against him?
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. President, I suppose
the Senator from Michigan and myself are per-
fectly familiar with both bills, because we have
read them and conned them over. I say the bill
as now amended requires the President to seize
the property of the rebels and hold it until a trial
can be bad.
Mr. HOWARD. With great respect, if the
Senator will allow me, such is not the provision
of the bill at all. The property is confiscated and
the title declared, to be absolutely forfeited, al-
though no trial may ever take place, and although
no party may ever be brought into court, and al-
though the party, when brought into court and
tried ultimately, shall turn out to be absolutely
innocent.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will not go over that. It
has been sufficiently gone over in the Senate.
Mr. HOWARD. I wish the bill to be clearly
understood. That is the object of my rising. T
wish to have it understood; so that, when gentle-
men come to vote, they shall vote intelligently, so
far as my humble efforts can enable them to do so.
Mr. GRIMES. I hope the Senator from Ohio
will allow me to suggestthatl trust he will not be
restrained from going over the discussion again.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do feel myself restrained,
although 1 have not taken any time heretofore,
from going over the discussion again. I will not
follow the remark of the Senator from Michigan.
What I have stated in regard to the bill of the
Senator from "New Hampshire is true. I have
read it ojper and over again; and the Senators here
who framed it, and who know all about it, say
that that is the legal principle upon which it is
founded.
Mr. HOWARD. If the Senator will pardon
me a moment 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Sen-
ator from Ohio yield the floor?
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not yield. I would do
it in any other case; but I do not wish to reopen
the debate.
Mr. HOWARD. I assert that that is not the
principle of the bill. It is a misapprehension.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator
from Ohio, declining to yield the floor, will pro-
ceed without interruption.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not wish to go into the
dispute which wÂ« have had here for three or four
days between the opponents and friends of this
bill. I simply desire to give the reasons why I shall
vote against this motion to prevent a practical re-
sult of this controversy. Sir, I am sick and tired
of this debate. There has not been a single argu-
ment on this subject of confiscation but what was
exhausted in the first month of the discussion. I
believe the argument against the doctrine of con-
fiscation was substantially exhausted by the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Cowan,] in his first
very able speech. I therefore do not wish to re-
open the discussion; nor will I stand in the way
of any practical solution of this difficulty. It js
as plain as day that there is a difference between
the Republican members on this floor on the sub-
ject. Probably a majority of them desire a prop-
osition at least as stringent as that contained in
the House bill. A minority of them desire only
a bill like that which has now been adopted as an
amendment. As a matter of course, those who
are opposed.to all confiscation measures will vote
with those who favor the least and the smallest
confiscation measure. Because they have suc-
ceeded in carrying a majority of the Senate in
favor of their views, I will not stand in the way
of some practical bill, even if it does not go far
enough. It is always better, in a legislative body,
when you cannot have your own way, to do the
best you can. It is a principle by which 1 have
always been governed; and I will not resort to
any other. If the motion of thu Senator from Il-
linois prevails,all this debate will be opened again;
and then, if he should succeed in carrying his
proposition, you have no practical results. You
send back to the House of Representatives, as an
amendment to one bill, another bill which they
have passed; and you have the dispute over again.
Now, Mr. President, it seems to me the best
way to get along with this matter would be this:
every Senator has made up his mind upon it; let
us have as many votes as may be desired, (and
under pat liamentary law you can get three or four,)
to test the sense of the Senate as to which of these
two bills they prefer; and if a majority of the Sen-
ate are in favor of tho bill as framed by the Sen-
ator from New Hampshire, let us pass it, and send
it to the House. If the House agree to it, then
we have a modified quasi confiscation bill at any
