APRIL 1, 1862.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

March two brigades [at] Ramer's Station, with two batteries, to Iuka Springs, carrying two day's rations. Don't wait to cook. Inspect to see all is in order for action, and all present. The enemy has landed at Eastport, and is advancing on Iuka. A regiment of cavalry leaves here. Keep two companies to cover your front, and urge forward the balance. Where are McNairy's and Gordon's cavalry commands?
