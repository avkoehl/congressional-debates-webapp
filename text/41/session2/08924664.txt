Mr. DAVIS. I think the honorable Senator
from Missouri must expect a pause on this
section. If I understand it, it affects the pay
of all grades of officers in the Navy. 1 think
the Senate had better adjourn on this section.
I think the pay allowed some of the inferior
officers probably is not enough. Some of them
have talked to me on the subject, and I should
like to have an opportunity to make a com-
parison.
Mr. DRAKE. Before the honorable Sen-
ator moves an adjournment, I desire to state,
for his information and that of all other Sen-
ators, that this matter of the arrangement of
a pay-table for the Navy was made necessary
by the adoption in the naval appropriation bill
iu the House of Representatives of a partial
pay-table, embracing only some eight or nine
different grades of officers. The Naval' Com-
mittee of the Senate has been engaged for
several weeks in a very earnest and laborious
effort to endeavor to put the whole pay-roll on
some rational basis. Whenever the matter
comes before the Senate for discussion I trust
to be able to satisfy not only the honorable
Senator from Kentucky, but all other Senators,
that probably we have come about as near to
making a fit and proper pay-table for the Navy
as has been done in many years; and I shail
be ready to offer any explanation on any point
in it whenever the matter comes before the
Senate. I will state for the information of Sen-
ators that these amendments are all printed,
and that at the close of the amendments I have
caused to be printed a comparative statement
of the present pay and of that proposed in the
amendment, so that every Senator might bef
able to see the thingexactly as itis at a glance.f
I believe the matter of adjournment is before}
the Senate, and I am only prepared to express!
my willingness to explain any matter about this
amendment to the honorable Senator, or anf
other Senator, whenever it is taken up again!
Mr. DAVIS. I move an adjournment. |
TAX BILL. I
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair under-l
stood the arrangement was that this bill should1
be passed over at the adjournment, and the bill
in regard to the taxes and tariff taken up to be
left as the unfinished business. Does the Sen-
ator from Kentucky yield for that purpose?
Mr. DAVIS. Certainly.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The pending bill
will be passed over, and House bill No. 2045
will be considered as before the Senate.
CHANGE Of BASK LOCATION.
Mr. McDONALD. I ask the Senator from
Kentucky to give way a moment to allow the
Senate to consider a joint resolution reported
favorably this morning by the Finance Com-
mittee. j
There being no objection, the Senate, as in|
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con- ']
sider the joint resolution (S. R. No. 218) J
authorizing the First National Bank of Fori"
Smith, Arkansas, to change its location andj
name.
The joint resolution was reported to th
Senate without amendment, ordered to be en
grossed for a third reading, read the third
time, and passed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill to reduce
taxation is now before the Senate.
Mr. DAVIS. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Tcjesday, June 21, 1870.
The House met at eleven o'clock a. m.
Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. J. G. Butler.
The Journal of yesterday was read' and
approved.
- BRIDGE ACROSS MISSOURI RIVER. .
Mr. PALMER. I ask unanimous consent
to report back from the Committee on. the
Pacific Railroad House bill No. 1227, to author-
ize the construction of abridge across the Mis-
souri river, with an amendment.
TheSPEAKER. The bill willberead, after
which objections to its consideration at this
time will be in order.
The bill, which was read, provides that for
the more perfect connection of any railroads
that are or shall be constructed to the Missouri
river, at or near Council Bluffs, Iowa, and
Omaha, Nebraska, the Missouri River Bridge
Company be, and is hereby, authorized to con-
struct and maintain a bridge over said river
at Council Bluffs, provided that said bridge
shall be constructed in accordance with the
plans and regulations, and be subject to the
supervision and uses, terms and conditions pre-
scribed in the first and second sections of an
act to authorize the construction of certain
bridges, and to establish them as post roads,
approved July 25, 1866, .and when so con-
structed shall be and remain a military and
post road.
The amendments were to insert " Railway"
betweenMissouri River " and " Bridge Com-
pany;" insert "Omaha and" between " at"
and " Council Bluffs." Also to add to the bill
the following:
Andprovided further. That thospans of said bridge,
from nier to pier, shall not be less than than two
buMtfed and fifty feet.
,/llr. STILES. I object.
REMOVAL OF POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I rise to
make a privileged report from the select Com-
mittee on Reconstruction. But before I do so
I ask leave o'f the House to have taken from the
Speaker's table, for action at this time, a Sea-
ate bill for the remdval of political disabilities
from a gentleman living in North Carolina,
who has been appointed consul at Tampiea,
but cannot enter upon the discharge of the
duties of his office because of his inability to
take the test-path.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I object to
this peddling out pardon and amnesty when
the select Committee on Reconstruction can
report a general bill at any time.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. It is but a
single name, and he is waiting only the action
of the House to enable him to take office.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Well, I will
withdraw my objection.
The Clerk read the title of the bill, as fol-
lows:
A bill (S. No. 998) to relieve Henry A. Badham
from the iogal and political disabilities imposed by
the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the
United States.
Mr. FERRISS. I object.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, from the
select Committee on Reconstruction, reported
a bill (H. R. No. 2278) for full and general
grace, amnesty, and oblivion of wrongful acts,
doings, and omissions of all persons engaged in
the war of the late rebellion; which was read
a first and second time, ordered to be printed,
and recommitted.
DONATION OP CONDEMNED CANNON.
Mr. UPSON. I ask unanimous consent to
introduce a joint resolution donating con-
demned cannon.
The joint resolution, which was read, directs
the Secretary of War to deliver to the Soldiers'
Monument Association at Willoughby, Ohio,
for the ornamentation of the soldiers' monu-
