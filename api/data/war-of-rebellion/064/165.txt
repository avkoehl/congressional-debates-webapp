command is on this side of Black River. He says he saw quite a lot of them as he came up all along the road, in squads, from 20 to 60 in each squad. The last he saw on Eleven Points River. They all were moving in this direction in different routes. He says he knows he must have seen some 500 or 600 men, all mounted; horses very poor, the men mostly bad clothes, and armed with all kinds of arms. He sails Kitchen also had a squad separate, and that everybody is trying to get away. The rebels will escort their friends as far this way as they think they are safe. They also send their wives up here to live again. The Widow has moved up in this country, or she started up here. He says she had some 5 or 6 negroes and some 5 mules and horses. Kitchen, with 25 men, escorted her as far as Jack's Fork. I don't know where she is. I have not heard from her yet in this county. Her farm is near Lake Spring. I sent Captain Benz yesterday morning down in that county to look around. This county seems full of bushwhackers, 3 and 4 together, but have done no mischief yet that I can learn. I have the boys out every day. I will try and do the best with them I can. I apprehend no danger of an attack here, but they will pester the county a great deal. People are all working finely and trying to make crops. I will protect them the best I can with my small force.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEVI E. WHYBARK,

Captain, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 1, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN, Warrensburg, Mo.:

In reply to your telegram relative to the issuing of an order making all property captured by the citizen guards prizes to the captors, the major-general directs me to say that he has no authority to issue such an order, and cannot, therefore, sanction anything of the kind. Yet, if the citizen guards really capture from the enemy any property, the general thinks under the circumstances no very strict accountability would be called for, unless in matters of grave and vital importance.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 1, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN, Warrensburg, Mo.:

Further in answer to your telegram relative to calling out the militia to protect the towns, &amp;c., while our forces are concentrating, the general commanding deems it more advisable, when the necessity for local protection becomes certain, to call for a regiment or more of select and reliable men-say provisional troops. In the mean time the general bids me recommended to you to have in view such a step if matters grow more threatening. As yet the commanding general does not deem it advisable to disturb the farmers in their work, but will await further developments of the enemy's intentions before more decided action.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
