will be established at the residence of Mr. Collins, and strict watch kept on Cedar Bayou from the mouth to the bayou entering Cedar Bayou above the station. Each outpost will be furnished with a signal to indicate the approach of the enemy, so that the threatened point may be re-enforced with the least possible delay.

Captain SAMUEL CALDWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: By direction of the major-general commanding the corps, I crossed a small force on the 24th instant over the bay to the peninsula opposite this camp, and proceeded down it toward the point, a distance of about 5 miles. In many places it is miry or boggy, but can be easily traveled over by any one acquainted with the country. No signs of recent travel were discovered. Persons could pass in and out without being seen from this side of the bay. The fires discovered by the major-general and myself on the 23rd were made by Federal soldiers out hunting.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. K. BAILEY,

Colonel, Commanding Regiment.

Major-General STEELE,

Commanding Department:

The citizens of Tell and Pope Counties feel now more than ever our perilous situation, Captain Blanchard being ordered to join his command, leaving us only a small, disorganized force of the Fourth Arkansas, not sufficient by any means to protect the large amount of Government cotton and other property accumulated here. Would respectfully ask that Captain Blanchard be retained here until he can be relieved by another force.
