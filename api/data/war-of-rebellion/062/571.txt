Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: A very large number of men will leave this region of country within a month or six weeks for the gold mines of Idaho. Is it proposed by the Government to require any papers for them from provost-marshals or other officials showing that the quota under the draft from the sub-districts has been filled or that they are otherwise exempt from draft? Will you please instruct me on this subject as early as convenient?

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Steamer Northerner with forage has arrived from up river. It is rumored that the troops have arrived at the mouth of Red River. I have sent a staff officer to see about it. Steamer Albert Perce also touched here from up river. Grave charges against Meade, in reference to Gettysburg affair, result of Sickles' testimony before committee.

A more full report from the Northerner is to the effect that the fleet left Vicksburg on the evening of the 9th, passed Memphis on the 10th, and entered the mouth of Red River the same evening. As the Northerner passed Red River, the fleet had nearly all entered. I shall have a more reliable report to-morrow morning.
