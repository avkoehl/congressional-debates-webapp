Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the report that my division and a portion of General Wilson's division have just arrived here. Our expedition was very successful until this afternoon, when we were surrounded and overpowered and had to abandon our transportation, wounded, and prisoners. I escaped with my division by taking it through the woods and charging across the railroad. General Wilson has probably gone back to go round by way of Jarratt's Station. The fight occurred near Reams' Station, on the Halifax road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

August KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General.
