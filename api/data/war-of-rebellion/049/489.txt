WASHINGTON, D. C.,

November 25, 1863.

Major-General MEADE:

A great battle has been fought to-day at Chattanooga and our troops were victorious. Thomas took Missionary Ridge by a magnificent charge, and Hooker has penetrated to the rear of the rebels at Rossville, thus placing them between two fires. Telegram from Willcox says courier from Burnside reports thirty days' provisions in Knoxville, and army in good spirits and abundantly strong to resist an attack.

P. S. -Since writting the above the following is received:

[Sub-inclosure.]

CHATTANOOGA,

November 25, 1863.

Although the battle lasted from early dawn until this evening, I believe I am not premature in announcing a complete victory over Bragg. Lookout Mountain top, all the rifle-points in Chattanooga Valley, and Missionary Ridge all entirely carried and now held by us. I have no idea of finding Bragg to-morrow.
