he should adopt m reference to the message He at one time
had concluded to leave it quietly on .he table, as the subject
would necessarily come into the negotiation between the two
Governments unibeai uval of the special mission to Bnsiand
He availed himself of the opportunity of expressing his~plea
sure that sued a mission was to ba sent He hoped and he be
Jieved it was sen t,aad would come m the ppmt of peace, and that
an end would be put to all the questions in controversy between
two people that ought to be at peace He intended to avoid, on
his part, any step that might throw impediments m the way < fa
fate and hjnorabie adjustment But, on full rerleetion, he came
to the conclusion that it was due to thp importance of the sub
ject, that it bhould be íefrned to the appropnate committee
An omission to do so might be consumed into an indiffuence to
the s abject, and theieby t>ink it m the scale oi relative impoi
lance, compared to the other questions at issue between the
Governments Of all those questions he deemed it by fn the
naostimporiantin character, and most üasigertmb to the peace
and quiet of the two countries and of greatei mvnmide to the
section of the Union mote i «mediately interested As impor
tant as was the boundary question to Mane, or the question
ol seaich to the navigation and commeicial lnteiest, encaged in
the African irade they were nothing in importance to the inte

he did not believe it was discuet to anticipate r\p\*u ive action

belonsed to the Committee or Finance, and not t< the Commit

President's Message, and he did not believe there was a law on
the statutes for levenue, which had originated m the Com

Mr SIMMONSren ?ikrd thatbefoie he moved i reference

fur an alteration of the tariff, foi the last twenty y ears, had been

Mr WOODBURY lepl ed that, last >pai, an alteration of
the taufF was made by the Committee on Finance and that, m
ihe ¡louse such propositions had come from the Committee of
Wavs and Means, in accordance with the recommendations of
the Treasury Department
Mi CLAY sail that the Committee on Manufactures one of
the most important s andmg committees of the Senate, aft r a
careful corsiderafion and consultation, had amhouzed their
chamnan to ask that they might employ a clerk, but as the re
quest had met with opposu on he put it to the fandor Of the
Renate whe her the simple statement of the case was not suf
fl uent to induce them toagiec to the proposition On one side
eentlemen weie opposed to any tauff for pro ec ion and on the
oihe side eeuilemen contended An incidental protection and
merely nn thi'-difference of opinion as to tbenetessiy to em

leaving the mmdsof^ena oisfree to operate u ron what might be

had neaily doubled fiom what it was during the preceding
nine years, the industry of the country was going on, and i
was nevei moie active and progressive than it waa at the pre*
sent time Men of intelligence had said that free trade was
good for them and for the cotton business, and all who trans
acted business on then own capital desired no change, and all
this resulted from the opeiation of free aade The gentleman
from Kentucky was behird the time, and he might as well at
tempt to st p the Mississippi as to attempt to control the cur
rent of free trade, and it was not in the power of any man
to resist the progress which Providence had intended should
goon
Mr WRIGHT said that thcSecretary of the Senate had ah
ways had copying done whether it was desired by the commit
tees t> which he had been attached, and he thought that this
might now be performed without authorizing the committee to
employ a clerk for that pin pose He did not believe that any
eleik could facilitate for one hour the examination into laws,
for no member of the committee would act upon the judgment
of the cleik, and he would suggest that it cnctüars were to be
°ent itom the committee, the best mode would be to publish
them at once, and let them go to all, and the committees
would receive answe-s from those to whom they might
be "ent, there .vould then be no ground for the charge of parti*
ahty
Mi BUCHANAN wanted to submit a few words, as the law
yeiswotitd ay, to "exclude a conclusion," lie was consulted
a few days ag >, is to whether he would I e wilhrg to employ a
clerk and he answered, from couite«y, that if a majority
thought a (lerk to be necessary, he would vote for ooe But
he protested against any a t°mpt in either quarter ol the Senate,
tociettea discus0ioa as to a home valuation on the simple
proportion to employ a clerk He wHied t< carry out fairly
tb( [ tmciples of the Compiomise act and if the Committee on
Manufactures thought that they coull get such information as
would benefithiun, he would he extremely happy in their sue
ceas When the t inff question came up, he would be prepared
to express hi«opini ns upon thesn Jiect, anl he believed that.
if a little forbearance was exeicised the ques ion would, towaid
the end of the session, settle n&elf He «bowed that, under ex
istins law=, out debt woul 1 alieady amount to $17,000,000, that
no membet ol either Ilou^e =o far as he knew, wasm favor of
an annually increasing debt that all prefenedthe imposition
of mcrea ed duties on imports to borrowing more and m re mo-
ney and all were willing to provide m this manner for the ne*
ccssaiy wants of the Government That even after the pro
ceeds of the public land" should be recalled, and the expendí
tuiesofthe (iovermrent reduced by a wise economy, it would
still be necessary to impose additi nal revenue duties to meet
the necessities of the Government, and in this hewa  persuaded
no Senator would olject
Mr CI AY continued the debate, and in the course of hta re*
marks, said that, for some days past, he bad had under conside-
ntion theeeneial subjectoi economy and retrenchment, eo far
as Congress coul 1 take cugr i7ance of the subject, but this could
not be carried out, without the co operation ot the Executive,
