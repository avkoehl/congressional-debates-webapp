WAR DEPARTMENT, September 11, 1862.

Major-General VAN DORN, Jackson, Miss.:

The exchanged prisoners must be sent to their respective regiments. Where the headquarters of the regiment is with you it will remain under your command, and brigades and divisions may be formed without reference to former brigades and divisions, but troops of the same State must be brigaded together as far as practicable. Conscripts must be distributed to all the regiments of the State. Every effort will be made to arm and equip the troops. Your rank necessarily gives you the right to command General Price when you are acting together. Nothing in these instructions must be considered as rescinding the orders or interfering with the arrangements of General Bragg.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
