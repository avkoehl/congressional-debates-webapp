thws of thecap tarns, commandeis,. nd lieuh nants,
and the wants of ihe service require a further addi-
tion to their numbeis
As the appropriations for the South Sea Explor-
ing Expedition, in. the law authorizing the same,
amounting to three hundred thousand dollars, were
inadequate to the expense of its outfit, it became
necessary to submit estimates iot further appropria-
tions for this object, which was done at the last
stated session of Congress.
With my letter to the President of the United
Stales of the 6th of Februaiy last, and by him sub-
mitted to the House of Representatives, were siate-
ments of the Boaid oí Navy Commissioner*, by
which it appeals, that there had been expended
upon the Macedonian from those appropiiatious
about $6:2,000 , upon the ship Ileliet, bares Pio-
neer and Consort, and sehoonet Pilot, to be taken
irom the same appropriations, the sum of $168,000,
and that to complete theequipments of these ve-seh,
exclusively ot provisions, instruments, and contin-
gencies, with the prepaiation of which the Boaul
was not charged, n was estimated that $70,000
moie would be required, making in all $300,500,
exceeding by $500 the amount oí the appropria-
tions
The estimate submitted for the annual expenses
of these vessels was $346,431 00, amounting, for
the three years, during which time it was intended
the exploring squadion should be absent, to
§1,039,293 00. In this estimate is included Ihe
sum of $13,842 50 for the annual expense of the
.scientific corps of the expedition, amounting, with
then assistants, to the number oí eighteen.
As this statement of facts could leave no doubt
that the Exploring Expedition would cost neaily, it
not quite, a million and a half of dollars, and is it
greatly exceeded in number of vessels and men me-
mos! succesdm expeditions of a like cuaracterhore-
tofi ic s ut o ii bv the mitiiimi t'oueisct \ u p1,
it was believed that its amount would have been
reduced by withholding a part of the appropria-
tions asked for by the estimates. This, howevei,
was not deemed expedient, and the full appropria-
tions were made by an act of the 3d of March last.
Before this time, Lieutenant Commandant Tat-
nall, who had performed a cruise to the Coast of
Mexico in the Pioneer, repoited so unfavorably of
her sailing, that it was deemed proper to examine
into her condition, as well as that of the bark Con-
sort and schooner Pilot, which, with the Pioneer,
had been buiH expressly foi this expedition, and
which, in point of sailing, were not considered
equal to the Pioneer.
On the 10th of April, Commodore Jones was in-
formed that the Commissioners of the Navy had
made arrangements to have a thorough examina-
tion of the barks Pioneer and Consort, and the
schooner Pilot, with a view to asceitam then suf-
ficiency ior the service contemplated, that the chief
constructor, Col Humphries, and Mr Gnce, na-
val architect, were ordered on this duty, and Com-
modore Jones was requested to join them, which he
did.
On the 26th of AprJ, at his own suggestion, he
was instructed,  vith the vessels ol his squadton,
except the Macedonian, to proceed to tea, and make
a full trial of then sailing, and was dnected 'o return
to Norfolk within twenty dais alter sailing.
Commodore Jones, on his íelurn from his expe-
rimental emise, reported favo^abl} of the sailmb
qualities of the vessels, but recommended that they
should be put into dry dock, for the purpose of the
examination winch had been pioposed, and for
such repairs and alteration's as might be deemed
necessaiy Measuies were taken for doing this as
soon a-, the ship oí the line Delaware, then undei
a course of íepans, could be taken out of the dock
On the 30*K of May, Commodore Warrington
was directed to piepare the Pioneer, Consoit, and
Pilot, foi going into dock As Commodore Jones
had required thatanolhei schooner should be added
to his squadron, without which he should not con-
sider the expedition complete or efficient, it seemed
the more proper that the condition oí these vessels
should be thoroughly examined.
On the 8th of June, a board of five officers, Com-
modores Qhauncey, Moras, Warrington, Patter-
son, and Wadsworth, was ordered to<make such
TO THE CONGRESSIONAL
Hepoit nj /he bcci'iuiy uj the Navy.
cxaimmtn n,, n I to inquiie wh th'r the exped'tioi
might not be reduced in number of vessels and
men, with advantage to the counlry, and without
prejudice to the success of the expedition. Th'S in-
quiry I wished m ide, from the consideration that the
difficulty of prot uring ihe necessary funds for fit-
ting out this squadron was greatly increased by the
suspension of specie payment*- by the banks, which
had then taken place, which difficulty had not been
foreseen by Congress when the large appropriations
for the expedition weregrantsd, and which made it
the dulv> of the diTerent depirlmcnts of Govern-
ment to limit ihe usual and auihon/el opemli-
tuie-s, as far a> the sime could be done without in-
jury to th" public serucc, and from the considera-
tion that, «hould a pirt of the vessels ol ihe squa-
dron be fojtid unfit for the service required, it
would be better that the squadron should sail wilh
a reduced foice, th.'ii wait until other vessels could
be substituted
On the 13tii of July, the board reported that the
occupation ot the dock at Gosport, and the employ-
ment ol some of the membeisof the board, pre-
vented a meeting unt 1 the 30th of June That
the barks and school er were put into dock and ex-
amined, ceriaui alteijtions recommend d, which
could soot be completed, bj which the vessels "might
be made to answer the purposes proposed sufficient-
ly well to j notify their employment "
The board state lhat had they " been called

stile the number anet character of the vesse's,
which in their opinion, would be best calculated
to secure the attainment of these prope>sed objec s-,

which have teen prepared " They were of
opinion mat a smaller numler wmi'd have an-
svveied the purposes, yet, from a consideration ol

merate, and as the officer selected to command the
exped'tion was satisfied with the vessels, they came
to the conclusion, that no i eduction could be made
in their amount at this late period, without preju-
dice to the success of the expedition. They, how-
ever, íecommended a ¡eduction of the number of
officers and men to about five hundred, exclusive
of the scientific corps. To this reduction, although
in ray opinion a very proper one, Commodore Jones
made such decided objections, that I thought pro-
per Ui yield to his wishes, and so informed him, and
his fcireuas con'inu'd at six hundre 1 in 1 Ihiee
orneéis  and meo,  e'rlusiveol ihe scl* ltific corps
Before tne proposed alterations e mid be com-
pleted, Comra >dore Jon s discoveied that the
cooking galle}s, originally ordered at his request,
made upon a new plan fir burning anthiacue coal,
would not answer the purpose pioposed, an 1 on
the 1st of August he requested they might b- re-
placed by others The galleys wanted have been
made with all possible despatch, at the navy yard
at this place, and the last of them was sent to
Not folk on the 6th of October
On the S6th of Septembei, Í issued o>-d isto
Commodore Jones to pioceed with *he vessels of
his squadron fiom Noifolk to New \ onr, as soon
as thev could be p.epaied lor removal. He wis
not able to sail fr >m Norfolk befoie the 12tn of
Octobei, and ainved at the hat be rol New York in
(he 16th ot that month
As I believed the st hooner Pilot, notwithstand ng
the alterations made in her, was not veil fitted for
service in the expedition, I give t > Commo tou
Jones me privilege ol purchasing such a fast sn'-
jng schooner as he might select, to be substilutfd
tor the Pilot la consequence o* which, on ihe
8th of Setember, he purchased the schooner Clan,
now called the Active, for eight thousand dolla,s,
upon which he was authorized to put such repairs
and impiovoments as he might think necessary at
the navy >ard, New York
Although the vessels had not heretofote been in
a situation to receive the scientific cirps, and I
could not, with propneiy, older them to icport to
the Commodore for duty, yet, I thought it proper
o put them upon pay, which v. as done on ihe 4th
day oí July last And I requested Commodore
Jones, if his convenience would permit, to meet a
large portion of them at Philadelphia, for the pur-
GLOBE.___________9
¡Sen, and flWjjf Seps,
pose ol having a perfect understanding wiffrihem-,
as to then accommodations with their books, instru-
ments, &c on board the vessels of his squadron.
This meeting took place m July, and such arrange-
ments, I understand, were made, as were perfectly
satisfactory lo the Commodore and to the gentle-
men of the scicntifiecorps.
As it was necessary to procure a great variety of
ai tides foi the gentlemen oí the scientific corps,-
for which requisitions could not conveniently be
made without a consumption of much time, I found
t nc cessiry to place funds m the hands of one gen-
tlem m of the corps m Philadelphia, and one in New
York I also placed five thousand dollars in the
hands of Commodoie Jones on the 29th ot August
last, for the pmpose of purchasing such articles
ior lie expedition as it was inconvenient to make
lequisitions loi, and on the 12th of October placed
twelve thousand dodars, subject lo his drafts, 0&
like purposes, m the hands ot his puiser This
unusual coils" was adopted that Iheie might be no
delay in the sailing of the Expedition
The objects of removing the squadron from Nor-
folk to New York, as stated by Commodore Jone?,
were to complete the stoies, and lo introduce some
proper apparatus lor he tung the vessels in cold lat-
itudes These, I tooir. it for granted, would not re-
quue more than two or tnree weeks for their com-
pletion, and fiom the general ordpr of Commodore
Jones at Noi lolk, I felt a confidence the Expedition
would leaie the Unite 1 States m the month oí No-
ve jibcr I, therefore, as soon as I knew of the ar-
uva! ofthe squadion in New York, directed the
gent i m u of the sc lentific corps to report to Com-
modore Jones (or duty.
On the 3d of Novembei I wrote to Commodore
Jones that the chronomeieis for his squadion weie
ready at the dep it, in this place, and requested him
to send t>vo competent officers to lake charg* of
lb'11 Oit Ii 'i d'"i e mont'i is nt 1 im siding
iiistiue'io is 11 be ca ned into eficct as soon as his
vessels were, ip all respects, ready for sea, and on
the 16th of the month twenty-five chronometers, in
good order, were dehveied to the officers sent for
them.
Had I known the extent of wotk required for the
vessels of the squadron, after their arrival at New
York, I should not so soon have directed the scien-
tific corps to report, or have issued my sailing in-
structions
By a letter from C immodoie Ridgely of the 21st
of Novembei, I "ind that 'he work upon the vessels
ol tins sqTMlron, a let their arrival at New York,
up to the loin ol the mc nth, amounted to four
thousand six hundred and tmrly-one dollars, and
that ihere remained to be done, after that day, to
the amount of two thousand three hundred and
thirty-three dollars, all of which requires much
more time than 1 had anticipated
All this work I believe, however, is necessary,
and would not have beei ordered by Commodore
Jones, if the health and comtort ol his crews, and
the safety ol the cxpeu >i, had not depended
upon it, and impatient a lue pub'ic is, that the
expedition shou'd sa 1 immediate!1 it is bettc- that
there should still be some dijs' or "veeks' delay,
than that it should sid before Ihe i essels are fully
prepared
The Commissioners of the Nivy hold no cone-
pon tenca with the < ommantters of vessels m com-
mission, except in relation to their supplies of pro-
visions and stoies The steps, therefore, taken by
Commodore Jones, under his discretionary powers,
to have the vessels of his squadron fitted out as
he should deem most expedient, were not under the
control of the Commissioners, nor subjected to the
strict regulations generally observed id fitting out
vessels foi foreign stations
It was believed, howevei, that but little work
remained to be done on the vessels after their sail-
ing from Norfolk, and tnat bul a small advance
would be required for completing the stores Yet
it appeirs from the letter of Commodoie Ridgely,
betore citrd, that the expenditures lequuid at New
York for these vessels amount to the sum of
$6,932 89 and for the schooner Active, includ-
ing sea stoies, the sum oí $14,700 96, in all,
$21,633 85 To these must be added purchases,
made by authontj of Commodore Jones, of articles,
