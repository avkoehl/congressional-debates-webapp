WAR DEPARTMENT,

March 13, 1862

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

The President, having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by yourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same, but gives the following directions as to its execution:

1st. Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain that the enemy shall not repossess himself of that position and line of communication.

2nd. Leave Washington entirely secure.

3rd. Move the remainder of the force down the Potomac, choosing a new base at Fort Monroe or anywhere between here and there, or at all events move such remainder of the army at once in pursuit of the enemy by some route.

Seven o'clock 40 minutes.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,Washington, D. C., April 2, 1862.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following condensed statements of the forces left under my command for the defense of Washington:

Infantry......................................... 15,335

Artillery........................................ 4,294

Cavalry (six companies only mounted)............. 848

------

Total............................................ 20,477

Deduct sick and in arrest and confinement........ 1,455

------

Total present for duty.......................... 19,022

I have no mounted light artillery under my command. Several companies of the reserve artillery of the Army of the Potomac are still here, but not under my command or fit for service.

From this force I am ordered by General McClellan to detail two regiments (good ones) to Richardson's division (Sumner's corps) as it passes through Alexandria; one regiment to replace the Thirty-seventh New York Volunteers in Heintzelman's old division; one regiment to relieve a regiment of Hooker's division at Budd's Ferry; total, four regiments. I am also further ordered this morning by telegraph to send 4,000 men to relieve General Sumner at Manassas and Warrenton, that he may embark forthwith.
