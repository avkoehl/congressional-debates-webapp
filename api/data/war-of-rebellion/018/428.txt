STRASBURG, June 23, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Many rumors of forces moving from southward. Among them a force of 4,000 reported moving toward Moorefield. Colonel Downey's spies, returned a few days since to Petersburg, report no enemy at McDowell or Monterey. To guard against chance of first-mentioned report proving true, have directed General Kelley to advance Eighty-fourth Ohio to Romney, and retire upon it the garrisons of Petersburg and Moorefield if threatened by superior force. Have also sent General Kelly a battery of rifled guns and sent four guns to Lieutenant-Colonel Harris. The rumor is that the Jackson force is largely strengthened by troops from Beauregard.
