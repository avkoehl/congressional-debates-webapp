the conclusions reached by him touching the parties names as connected with those in arms against the Government. If that late order* from the War Department does not preclude the arrest of persons I would suggest that James D. Pully, A. P. Corder and Dr. John M. Clemerson, of Marion, Williamson County, be arrested at once. There can be no peace in that county while these men remain at large. I also think that it would be well to seize C. C. Carpenter at McLeansborough, Hamilton County, and Dr. D. Green at Mount Vernon, Jefferson County. The others although dangerous and noisy men may on account of our late brilliant victories on the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers keep quiet. The persons whose arrest I recommend will not.

I have by your kindness in furnishing me the necessary assistance been able at last to completely hold in check the reasonable elements in Southern Illinois, and now hope that no more "aid and comfort" may be extended to traitors in that quarter. It is feared, however, that the order of the Secretary of War already referred to releasing all political prisoners and confining arrests to the military authorities exclusively will again embolden the bad men of Illinois to renewed acts of disloyalty. Already boasts are freely indulged that the order is a confession of the illegality of the arrests made a guarantee against such in future and a perfect immunity against any interruption by the marshal.

It is well understood that I know almost every disloyal man in my district and such persons have been compelled to be quiet hitherto. As to what they may do hereafter I cannot say. If the Department intends that I shall as heretofore exercise an espionage over all plots of treason please inform me. If the order from the War Department transfers this duty to other hands I shall be greatly relieved; but it will take a great deal of time for any one man to become as thoroughly conversant with all the elements of disloyalty in Southern Ill have spent almost the entire past year in possessing myself of all sources of information likely to reach the schemes of our Illinois traitors, and I think that the disloyal in our State feel that they are completely at my mercy unless they are secured by and order from the Government at Washington. Hence the disposition to exult over the late order referred to. Will you please advise me as to my movements in the future and if my services are any longer needed in the direction mentioned?

I have discharged Mr. Frank, the detective employed in conformity to the order of your letter+ to me dated December 6, 1861, and ordered him to submit hi account to you for adjustment. Please refer to Mr. Bradley's letter to me from Chicago, left with you December 5, for the terms on which Mr. Frank was employed. I have paid him $150. I have also paid Mr. Davis $115. He was out of money, and I assumed that as he was here and under my charge you would approve the advance. Please inform me if Mr. Davis may remain in Illinois and how long. I can employ him to advantage but desire to use the best economy. The services of Mr. Frank and Mr. Davis have been of incalculable importance and I have no doubt they have been instrumental in preserving the public peace of Southern Illinois, as it is now well understood that nothing but the restraining fear of the marshal's office has kept from deeds of violence a great many men in the Ohio and Wabash River counties of Illinois.
