SPRINGFIELD, August 20, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Saint Louis:

Colonel Wright was at Hoffman's Ferry yesterday morning at 9 a.m. and was moving west to attack a force of the enemy moving south at Taberville, 8 miles above. He reports that they had been attacked from the north and driven back. His information is that it is Coffee's command. He does not say where General Blunt's command is. I have not heard from it in the State.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 20, 1862.

General BROWN,

Springfield, Mo.:

News from Sedalia confirms Colonel Wright's report. Colonel Warren and General Blunt were in hot pursuit of the enemy yesterday morning near Papinsville. The rebels about crossing the Osage. They will doubtless retreat through Vernon and Barton Counties. They are about 4,000 strong, under Coffee, Quantrill, Cockrell, and Tracy. You may be able to intercept them by a rapid movement to the west, if you have the necessary force available. You can doubtless afford to leave Springfield weak for a few days.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SPRINGFIELD, August 20, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Saint Louis:

Spy in from Cross Hollows reports that the enemy from Van Buren, under Rains, and from Fort Smith, under Colonel Carroll, have moved up to that point in some force. I think this is correct. I have not learned what the force is composed of.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SPRINGFIELD, August 20, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Saint Louis:

I have not force mounted sufficient for patrol, picket, and escort duty. Believing that Coffee would double on Blunt and Wright, I sent three days ago to Mount Vernon all the mounted troops I could spare, being 100 Second Wisconsin and two companies Greene County Militia, which with four companies of Lamar County Mounted Militia, are ordered to watch Coffee and harass him. The guerrillas are busy during this rising, and it requires every man I have in service to hold them in check south and east of me. The Tenth Illinois is on the road between this and Lebanon to protect the trains.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
