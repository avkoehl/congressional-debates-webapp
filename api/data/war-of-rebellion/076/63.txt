Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 5, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

A rebel officer, deserter, reports that the rebel cavalry have drawn eight days' rations and are to make a big raid, 10,000 strong, upon our railroad, passing by the left of the Federal army. Caution your commanders.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RESACA, GA., July 5, 1864.

Captain C. L. WHITE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A dispatch from Colonel Laiboldt (Dalton) says 100 or 200 rebel cavalry are scouting above here, east of the railroad, three miles south of this place. I have ordered Colonel Murray to send a strong force in the direction of Spring Place to try to intercept them. I think the force reported by General Vandever passed Villanow Sunday night and tore up the track south of Tunnel Hill. They may have formed a junction with the Sixth Georgia Cavalry, and comprise the force Colonel Laiboldt speaks of. I think half a regiment should be placed between Calhoun and Adairsville.

GREEN B. RAUM,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

RESACA, July 5, 1864-12 p.m.

Captain C. L. WHITE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A train of sixteen cars has been captured and burned three miles and a half south of Dalton to-night. Colonel Murray sent 200 men out in that direction this evening. The enemy is reported to be 300 strong. I have advised Colonel Murray to send out an additional force.

Brigadier General WILLIAM VANDEVER,

Rome, Ga.:

Do you know of any crossing on the Etowah between my outposts, three miles below here, and Rome? I have no cavalry here, and as yet have had but little time to explore the country adjoining my line. At last account Hart (Sixth Georgia) was at Jasper.

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
