to labor, as a means to further development,
while all labor tends to create new wealth.
When_ capital is invested in Government
bonds it is useful, so far as further development
is concerned, only in supplying the wants of the
owner. When employed in most other pur-
suits it adds to the national wealth. Certainly
it is not the public interest to make this invest-
ment so profitable and attractive as to draw
into it the capital of the country or to make it
so permanent as to become a privileged aris-
tocracy. No privilege should be granted to
the bondholder that is not granted to the note-
holder. Both are public securities, and both,
and equally, can appeal to the public faith.
No privilege should be given to the bond-
holder unless it is compensated for by some
advantage reserved by the Government, and
the whole public debt should be made to assume
such form that it may be a part of the circu-
lating capital ot the country bearing as low a
rate of interest as practicable, and only with
such exemptions as will maintain it at par with
gold. Whether this bill will promote these
objects it is for the Senate to say. I confi-
dently believe it will. I do not appeal to any
party for the support of this measure, for it
affects all alike. , AH must contribute to the
public taxes, and all will share in the benefits
of any relief.
But while we trust our political adversaries
may support this as a measure of relief to our
constituents, yet the fate of the bill must rest
mainly upon the Republican party. It is my
pride and hope that this powerful political or-
ganization, having conducted the country with
safety and honor through the most memorable
scenes of our history, may, still retaining the
confidence of the people, gradually guide them
hack into the channels of peace, reduce their
burdens, relieve them from oppressive taxes,
and start again in productive labor the millions
now waiting to develop the greatest country
God ever gave to man.
Now distrust seizes upon every one. Wild
schemes have been proposed, which drive cap-
ital from its moorings. Taxes are bearing
heavily upon unprofitable industry, and com-
plaints are made of the burden and distribution
of these taxes. Sectional divisions are already
showingtheirhydraheads, and disputes as to the
terms of public engagements cast doubts upon
the public faith. It is in such a time that Con-
gress is able to perform its highest duty—that
of an arbitrator. Upon questions involving the
public debt it is the only arbitrator. It cannot
shrink from this duty. I trust, sir, before this
session closes, I hat Congress will provide for the
redemption of our maturing bonds, thussaving
ultimately §17,000,000 a year; that it will adopt
such measures as will gradually make the dollar
in greenback in the hands of the laboring man
equal to a dollar in gold ; that it will throw off
the great mass of our internal taxes, and reduce
our ordinary expenses to the lowest, practicable
limit. These measures adopted, we may safely
leave to our constituents the renewal of trade,
the restoration of confidence, and the develop-
ment of industry.

SPEECH OP HON. 0. A. NEWCOMB,
of missouri,
If the House op Representatives,
February 22, 1868,
On the resolutions reported by the Committee on
Reconstruction for the impeachment of the Presi-
dent.
Mr. NEWCOMB. Mr. Chairman, never
since I have had the honor of occupying a seat
on this floor have I had a doubt but that the
country would be brought to this crisis, and
when the question ot impeachment was before
this House in December last I voted to sus-
tain the report of the majority of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, And yet, sir, I enter
upon the discussion of the resolution reported
by the Committee on Reconstruction with
mingled feelings of sorrow and joy—sorrow
in the consciousness that a man honored by
the loyal and true men of the country with
one of the highest positions in their gift, and by
his right of succession elevated to the highest
position on earth, should have so far fallen as
to betray their confidence in a systematic career
of State crime that has disgraced the Ameri-
can nation; and joy in the opportunity afforded
the American people of demonstrating to the
friends of liberal Government everywhere the
superiority of Republican over monarchical
institutions in the work of removing an un-
worthy and wicked ruler.
The impeachment and removal of Andrew
Johnson will be looked upon all over the
world as the grand crowning triumph of free-
dom and republicanism, and do more to over-
throw arbitrary power and oppression and
establish the universal Republic than any other
act of this Government up to this present time.
The war of 1812, the war with Mexico, and
the late civil contest with rebellion demon-
strated the power of the Republic to repel
invasion, to prosecute foreign war, and defend
itself against the machinations of internal
foes. The impeachment and removal of An-
drew Johnson will prove the power of the peo-
ple, under the forms of law, to remove a ruler
ot their own selection whenever lie proves
false to the ideas that underlie the institutions
of our country or his elevation to power. The
contests of arms resulted in victories of force
over force, while the successful impeachment
of a criminal Executive will prove the grand-
est of the many grand victories of liberty and
peace, more noble and enduring in its influ-
ence upon the future of the nation than ten
thousand victories won upon the field of car-
nage and strife.
This one victory of peace is wanting to secure
the perpetuity of the Republic and make im-
possible in the future internal wars for the
attainment of political rule. And it is for the
Fortieth Congress of the nation to determine
whether this grand and final triumph of truth,
liberty, and law over domestic treason and
executive treachery shall be achieved. Ap-
proaching the subject with such views, anil
having no ambition beyond the good of my
country and a desire to discharge my duty to
my constituents under my oath, and fully
realizing that the people demand action rather
than words, yet I should not feel that I had dis-
charged my whole duty should I remain entirely
silent.
Mr. Chai rman, I was scarcely prepared for
the strange and violent utterances that fell
from the lips of the learned gentleman from.
New York, [Mr. Brooks,] who intimates that
this is a contest for the control of a tew miser-
able offices. The gentleman would fain make
the country believe this proceeding in regard
to the removal of Mr. Stanton and the im-
peachment is a grand scramble for office and
spoils—only a question about who shall con-
trol the offices. Ifc would be natural to judge
that persons who place so low an estimate
