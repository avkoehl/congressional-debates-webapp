in inducing its removal. Should the enemy be successful in his attempt upon Savannah, Augusta will be seriously threatened, and if rapid in his movements it is probable that, in the confusion and panic which would be likely to ensue, much of the cotton would not be removed. I therefore refer to your excellency's serious consideration the propriety of the State authorities notifying the people of the intention of the military commander, in order that such preliminary arrangements may be made for the removal of the cotton should the unfortunate emergency arise, which would otherwise involve serious loss of property.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: The general commanding wishes Colonel Dunovant's regiment advanced as skirmishers until they engage the enemy. You will make such disposition of Leake's battery as circumstances may require. He has ordered two 42-pounder carronades to the work at Stony Creek. The general wishes you to keep him constantly advised of the enemy's movements.

I am, general, very respectfully,

Occupy the several causeways [intrenched] and all important positions from Stony Creek to Benton Causeway with one of the Georgia regiments. Keep Leake's battery in hand to occupy any work which may be threatened. Let the mounted troops keep the enemy always in view. If compelled to fall back from Hosper's Creek, burn the boats.
