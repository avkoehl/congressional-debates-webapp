captured. General Butler reports having last evening sent two brigades of infantry with a little cavalry within a few hundred yards of the inner line of works east of Richmond, meeting with no opposition.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 2, 1864-8 a. m. (Sent 8.10 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I forward dispatch* just received from Major-General Parke, being all the information I have to report. Parke's and Warren's losses in killed, wounded, and missing were yesterday estimated at 2,500. As Mott only brings 4,500, the actual re-enforcement is about 2,000.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Globe Tavern, October 2, 1864-11 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Parke and Warren report the enemy having withdrawn from some of the positions occupied yesterday. Signal officers report their main line of works as far as seen heavily manned. The inference is the enemy refuse battle outside their works, to which they have retired awaiting attack. Without your orders I shall not attack their intrenchments, but on being satisfied they are not outside of them I will take up the best position I can, connecting with the Weldon railroad and extending as far to the left as practicable, having in view the protection of my left flank, and then intrench. I should be glad to know your views and orders.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, October 2, 1864-11.10 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Carry out what you propose in dispatch of 11 a. m.-that is, intrench and hold what you can, but make no attack against defended fortifications.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, October 2, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

You may shorten the line to the extent you deem necessary to be able to hold it. All you do hold west of the Weldon road be prepared to give up whenever the forces holding it are necessary to defend any other part of the line. I have just returned from Deep Bottom. When I left the enemy were reported advancing down the New Market road.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
