Numbers 9. Report of Major General David S. Stanley, U. S. Army, commanding Fourth Army Corps, of operations November 14-December 1, 1864.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., February 25, 1865.*

On the 14th [November] Major-General Schofield arrived and assumed command, by direction of Major-General Thomas. On the 21st it became positively known, from a dispatch intercepted by General Hatch's pickets and from other sources, that the enemy were moving north and int he direction of Columbia. The roads, however, off the pikes were very bad, it having rained very heavily for some days, and then frozen, but not hard enough to bear wagons. It was believed the enemy could make but little speed, and the evacuation of Pulaski was made the afternoon of the 23rd. The corps marched to Lynnville that night, to which place the Second Division (General Wagner) had moved the day before. During the night it was learned that the enemy had made good use of his time, notwithstanding the bad roads, and that Colonel Capron's brigade had been driven out of Mount Pleasant, it was believed by an infantry force. This information was received about 1 o'clock at night, and the troops were immediately waked up and put in motion for Columbia, twenty-one miles distant. General Cox's division, of the Twenty-third Corps, was ten miles nearer Columbia, and marching at the same hour as ourselves he arrived in time to save Capron's brigade of cavalry from annihilation and perhaps the town of Columbia from capture. Turning west at a point three miles south of Columbia, on the Pulaski pike, General Cox, by a cross road, reached the Mount Pleasant pike, and immediately attacking the advancing rebels, drove them back. As fast as the divisions of the Fourth Corps arrived they were placed in line of battle and immediately entrenched themselves. The First Division, Brigadier-General Whitaker, did not get into position until after night. The enemy's cavalry made some demonstrations upon our left flank during the march, jut were easily driven off by a regiment of infantry commanded by Colonel Knefler. During the 24th and 25th a very strong and complete set of earth-works were constructed, but the line being very long, and leaving no disposable troops after properly occupying it, two divisions of the corps were withdrawn from it on the night of the 25th to occupy a short and interior line, leaving General Wood's division to hold the front, formerly held by the entire corps. Cox's division, of the Twenty-third Corps, at the same time crossed to the north of Duck River, and General Ruger commenced the construction of a bridge-head.

The enemy undoubtedly deployed their whole force upon our front, and they made several attacks upon our pickets; but it became evident very soon that Hood was moving to the east, and most likely with a view of crossing Duck River above us. The intentions of the enemy became so apparent that it was determined to cross the entire of our force to the north bank of Duck River. The night of the 26th orders were given accordingly, but the night was so dark and the rain poured down so that no progress could be made crossing the artillery, and at midnight the movement was given up the artillery replaced in position. During the night of the 27th the withdrawal to the north side of Duck River was made very successfully, the pickets leaving the
