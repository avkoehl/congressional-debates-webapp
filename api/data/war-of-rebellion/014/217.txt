Honorable E. M. STANTON,

We have steamers now here to transport 8,000 men. The transports which took troops from here on Tuesday should be back to-night. If so, I can readily send enough. If not, I can order by telegraph steamers from White House, if you direct the movement to be made.

Officers of your army, some of high rank, are sending details to their wives and friends, by telegraph, of the disasters, in respect to the number killed and wounded.

McCLELLAN'S, June 6, 1862-noon.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Has been raining, but now stopped. River still rising. All quiet to-day. Several deserters and contrabands state that J. E. Johnston was dangerously wounded in battle of Fair Oaks and that G. W. Smith is in command. Their loss is stated at 10,000. I only know that it is very great, far more than ours.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
