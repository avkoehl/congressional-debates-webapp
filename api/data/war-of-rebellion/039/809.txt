No. 311. Report of Brigadier General William N. Pendleton, C. S. Army, Chief of Artillery.

HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY CORPS, May 18, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit through yourself, as then in chief command at and near Fredericksburg, the following report of my own agency and that of the artillery under my direction, in the recent operations on this front:

From near Chesterfield Depot, on the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, where I had spent the winter months, having horses cared for and artillery organized, I was summoned, with all the artillery, by telegram from the commanding general, on the 29th April. Orders were at once issued, and my personal attention directed accordingly. Colonel Crutchfield, chief of artillery Second Corps, at Bowling Green, Caroline County, Virginia, with most of the artillery of that corps, was promptly communicated with. Alexander's battalion and two batteries of Colonel Cabell's battalion, and one of Colonel Garnett's battalion (all of First Corps), proceeded on the march toward Fredericksburg that afternoon. By sunrise of the 30th, the remaining artillery near Chesterfield was in motion, consisting of the Washington Artillery Battalion, and the general reserve, embracing Lieutenant-Colonel Nelson's battalion and Lieutenant-Colonel Cutts', except Lane's battery, absent on duty below Richmond.

Although a heavy rain rendered the roads exceedingly miry and difficult, the march was made with such spirit that Alexander's battalion reached the front early on the 30th, and was ordered toward Chancellorsville.
