Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, August 25, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. FOSTER,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: General Ord reports that in marching to his headquarters with two brigades, out of 1,800 men General Terry only arrived with 700. This is extraordinary even for straggling. The major-general commanding wishes you in marching over to use extraordinary precautions. Commanding officers of brigades, regiments, and companies should march at rear of their commands. Knapsacks and camp matters can be transported by supply trains, and the division so marched as to keep every man in the ranks. He wishes you to instruct your officers in this matter, and show that the corps can march as well as fight. Major-General Ord makes a very severe report as to the First Division. The column should be, by hourly halts, kept closed up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-3.10 p. m.

Commanding Second Division:

The major-general commanding directs that as soon as your command is relieved by General Ames, you march with it to the late headquarters of the Eighteenth Corps before Petersburg. A staff officer will be sent to conduct you. You will please send word when you are ready to march.

Respectfully,

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
