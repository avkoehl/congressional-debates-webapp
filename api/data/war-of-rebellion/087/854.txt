The enemy attacked Stony Creek Depot yesterday and burned most of the buildings, consuming some stores and corn, but most of the latter was saved. The railroad is unharmed. General Lee, coming up as the enemy was retiring, attacked and drove him rapidly eight miles, capturing some prisoners, but could not bring him to an engagement. The depot was occupied by about 150 men, under Captain Waldhauer, about 125 of whom are said to have been captured, among them, I regret to state, Major Fitzhugh, quartermaster. The enemy left some dead at the depot and along the route of his retreat.
