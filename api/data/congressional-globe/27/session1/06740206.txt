27th C«ng>"-1st Sfss.                                        Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Buchanan.                                                            _____Senate.
of the act, he may then file another petition to be
discharged fro  his debts, which may be granted at
any time afler ninety days from the date of the
decree declaring him a bankrupt. Seventy days'
notice is to be given to his creditors to appear in
court, and oppose his discharge, if they think pro-
per.
It thus appeared that there might be two formal
hearings m each case before the district court upon
every application; and that there would be, ib ma
ny of the cases, was beyond a doubt. Besides,
from the very nature of the proceedings in bank-
ruptcy, and from the provisions of the bill, the in-
terlocutory applications, and the examinations of
tbe bankrupt before the court, must be very nume-
rous. At every stage of the proceedings a large
portion of the time of the court must necessarily be
devoted to the subject.
Should the district court decide that the bankrupt
shall not be discharged, he might then demand a
trial by jury, or appeal from this decision to the
circuit court This would be another prolific
fountain of business for the district and circuit
courts of the United Slates
Thus far the proceeding was confined to the
the bankrupt peisonally But before what court
was his estate to be settled? By the terms of the
bill, the demands of all creditors of the bankiupt,
jf disputed, must be tried m the district court, ihe
controversies which might arise between the credi
ters and the assignees of the bankrupt, and also
between the bankrupt himself and his assignees,
must be settled in ihe district court, and, to use the
comprehensive terms of the bill, the jurisdiction of
that court was extended " to all acis, matters, and
tBmgs to be done under and in virtue of the bank
ruptcy, until ihe final distribution and settlement
of the estate of the bankrupt, and the close of the
proceedings m bankruptcy "
There were also several criminal offences created
by the bill, all of winch must be tried in the dis-
trict couits of the United States.
From the nature of the Federal Corstitution, all
the business which he had enumerated must neces-
sarily be transacted in the court;, of the United
States It cou'd not be transfened to the State
courts
Now, nr, said Mr B this bill will prove to be a
felodese It can never be < arned into effect, for
want of the nece sary judicial machinery Ano-
ther midnight judiciary must be established, to aid
the district courts in transacting ihe business of
bankruptcy The number of these midnight
judge* wh ch were added to the Federal Judiciary
in February, 1801, was eighteen, and if these were
necessary at that time, three times the number
would not be sufficient at present
He had just examined McCullough's Commer-
cial Dictionary, under the title Bankruptcy He
there found that the annua! number ofcommis
sions of bankruptcy opened in England on an
average of nine years, ending with the year 1830,
was a little below s-eventeen hundied The aveiage
annual number of all the commissions which is
sued during the «ame period, was about two ihou-
s ind one hundred One half of these seventeen
hundred cases were what are called town cases,
and the other h<tlf country cases To transact the
town business al ne, consisting of uaht hundred
and fifty c es annuallj, it had been found nec -
sary to establish a new Court of Bankruptcy, simi
lar to the ancient courts at Westminster Hall, con-
sisting of one chiet jU t^e, and three pu srie ju ges
To thij court there were at ac¡ied six commission-
ers, two principal registrars, and eight dep ity re-
gistrar? Such «as the juJicial fo ce tound reces
sary in England t > examine and decide upon the
cases of even hundred and fifty bankrupts in each
year
Then what provision had the pre ent bill made
to discharge ha f a million of bankrupts, ihe ruo
ber which its friendo jssert ex £i at pit ent in the
United States? None wha ever, except to cast this
burden upon the district courts of m- Unikd States,
wh ch, in the targe commercial cities, where tin
cases of bankruptcy mus' cniefly be { eard, had a)
ready as much business as they cuul 1 conveniently
transact These courts could ntt transact all this
business, if there were half a million of bankrupts
to be discharged, within the nexi twenty years
Sir, unless ycu establish new courts, and increase
your judicial force at least ten fold, it is vain for
jou to pass the present bill Without this, the law
can never be carried into effect. The moment it
goes into operation, these unfortunate bankrupts
will rush eagerly to the district courts in such num-
ber', as to arrest all other judicial business. This
bill provides that these cruris shall be considered
open every day in the year, for the purpose of
hearing bankrupt cases
The district courts of the United States were
scattered over the Union at great distances from
each other For example, there fere in the State
of New York, he believed, but two ot the<e courts
In Pennsylvania, one was held in Philadelphia,
another in Pittsburg, and a third in Wilhamsport.
Pitfburg and Philadelphia were three hundred
miles apart; and parlies, jurors, and witnesses
must be constantly in attendance from great dis-
tances at these two places, on the hearing of the
different bankrupts, and on the trial of all the
causes which might arise out of the settlement of
their estates By the operation of this bill, all these
causes woulc and mast be transferred from the
Slate to the Federal courts. This would be as in-
tolerable oppression to the people
Without entering into any detail of the frauds
to which this bill would give birth, he must be
permitted to advert to the effect which it would
have upon the rights of creditors in States distant
from the court where the debtor might make his ap-
plication It would spepdily sponge away all the
indebtedness/now very great, of the Southwestern
portion of the Union to the Eastern cities Our
merchants m those eities) should tke bill pass,
would have no difficulty m balancing their books
This would be done for them by the bill m the
easiest possible manner.
Under all other bannruptlaws which had ever
existed, or ever been proposed, either in this coun-
ty or in England, or any whereelse, as he be'ieved,
the debtor could not  obtain his certificate of dis-
charge without the express written as ent of a cer-
tain proportion of his   creditors   m number and
value    This rule   had never been found to ope-
rate severely in practice on honest debtors, whilst
it afforded some security to the creditors     Under
the present bankrupt laws of E¡ gland, the certifi-
cate of discharge must be signed by four-fifths m
number and value of the creditors of the bankrupt,
and under our old  bankrupt law of 1800, two-
thirds in nutnbsr and value of the creditors were
required to sign.   Without this express assent, no
bankrupt could receive his certificate of discharge
But the p-esent bill had completely reversed this
rule    Under it the debtor must be discharged,
"unless a majonty m number and value of his cre-
ditors, who have proved their debts, shall file their
v ntten dissent thereto "   Now  he should put  a
case, and miny such would occur under the pre-
sent bill     A merchant   in   Philadelphia  hid   ?
debtor  in   Mississippi, who owed   him $20,000
This debtor applies  to  fre district court of that
State for the benefit of the act    The merchant be-
lieves he  has been guilty nf fraud, and determ nes
to oppi se his discharge     He gie> or sends to Mis
sissippi  for this purpose     I  ask you, sir, vhat
chance h  would have to obtain the n°ces«a!y "proof
in a country wh re thousands were at *he samp
time appljiog for the benefit of the tonknipt law
The task uould be hopeless  and consequen ly the
attempt would be made but in  very  fe v  casps
Had the law required the express assent of I  -
thirds or even  i mínrity m number and va'ue of
the bankrupts creditors, the m rchirt would have
had one seemtty left     The debtor must have sa-
tisfied him that he  had   acted hon stly   before be
could have obtained  his assert    Now the debtor
would be discharged nnle s a maj nty expr'-S'sly
di«se it     The ancent ru'e had been reversed, and
ms ead of an express assent being reqjired to pro-
duce his discharge, the e must now he an express dis-
sent to prevent it    And if the majority did dissent,
what would be the consequence'   Was this con-
clusive, an 1 would the debtor slill remain liable?
No.sir.no    The  Philadelphia merchant would
then have to enter upon a new law suit    Notwith
standing this express dissent, the question would,
under the bill, be referred to a jury, and if they de-
cided in the bankrupt's favor, he was discharged
irorn his debts fore/er, even against the di sent of
all his creditors This jury would necessarily be
composed of his own neighbors,-all having a sym-
pathetic feeling with him, and looking upon the
distant Philadelphia creditor asan unjust andan
unfeeling man. This was a natural feeling, and
common to almost all men in similar circum-
stances It implied no imputations upon their
honesty Truly this bill was a measure to
relieve all debtors who might desire to cut loose
from their debts, without any adequate provision
for the security of creditors
But all these evils were nothing when compared
with the baneful effects which the bill would have
upon ihe morals of the people of this country.
Our people were already too much addicted to spe-
speculation, and too anxious to become sud-
denly rich As a nation, we required the rem
and the bit much more than the spur The
present bill would stimulate the spirit of speculation
almost to n adness Men would be tempted by
the hope of realizing rapid fortunes, and living
in affluence the remainder of their days, to em-
bark in every wild undertaking, knowing that
they had every thing to gam and notljmg to lose
This bill proclaimed not merely t o merchants
and insurers, whose business was from its nature
hazardous, but to every ctizen of ihe United
Siates, "you may be as wild and extravagant in
yout speculations as jou please—you may at-
tempt to seize the golden prize in any manner you
choose if you should suiceed you will then possess
what your heart most desires, if not, your debts
shall be blotted out m the easiest manner possible,
and jou may begin the world again " This was in
effect the language of the bill The consequence
must be that the faith of contracts would soon
become an idle word Our former bankrupt law
was wholly compulsory in its character, and was
confined to traders The present English bank-
rupt law expressly excludes farmers and grsziers
from its provisioi s We went a long distance in
advance of both The present bill would be in
effect wholly voluntary, and it embraced every
body under the sun, and all debts which had been,
or might be, conliacted
He would venture to predict, that when this bill
should go into operation the people of the United
Sta es would soon become astonished and alarmed
at its consequence- and it would be blotted out
of existence in a less time than had elapsed
between the passage and repeal of the act of
1800
He m'ght be asked if he were opposed to a
bankrupt law in any form HecouH answer that
he was not He would most cheerfully vote for
any safe measure of this nature which could be
carried into exucution by the courts of the United
Slates, and he did not believe tbat it would be very
difficult to frame such a measure The judicial
system of the Fedeial Government was of sucha
character, that it could never execute a bankrupt
law, modelled after th  English system, wuhout
producing great fraud, delay, and ímu tice If
you changed thi system, and increased ihe num-
ber of cou ts and judges, so as to enable them to
transact the business under this bill, u ith proper deli-
beration, and within a reasonable time, you would go
far towards producing a judicial consolidation of the
Union It wd, th  opinion of M- Lowndes thit we
houldbecompehedtoabindont ieideaoff raining a
bill upon the English mode), and adopt the system
which prt-vailed m countries subject to the civil
law For example, he (Mr B ) would permit a
debtor in failing circumstances to make any com-
position he could obtain frcm a majority or two-
thirds in number and value of his creduois. In
that event, he would di charge him Jrom his debts
is agams' the rerramder, unless ihey could prove
that he had been euilty of fraud He would never
place any unr r unate, but honest debtor, in the
power of a few vmdie ive creditors against the
will of the majority Such a law would, m a great
degree, execute itself, and dispense with nearly all
the machinery of this bill The composition between
the debtor and his creditors and bis assignment of
his property, for the benefit of them all, which he
