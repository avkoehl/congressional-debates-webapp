MEXICO, October 26, 1864-4.40 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have sent 200 mounted men to Pike County, all she has furnished. I have scouts out continually in Audrain. The Enrolled Missouri Militia from Lincoln County are now in Boone and Howard on a scout. Will send them to Lincoln County immediately on their return to this post. Have ordered one company from Wellsville to Middletown.

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 26, 1864-5 p. m.

Brigadier-General DOUGLASS, Mexico, Mo.:

Dorsey and Wood's banks are now at or near Cap au Gris, Lincoln County. Re-enforcements crossed at Hamburg from the Illinois side on the morning of the 25th; they will probably pass from their present position to near Prairieville, Pike County; thence to Louisville and Nineveh, Lincoln County; thence to Martinsburg, Audrain County, passing first south of Middletown, in Montgomery County. A cavalry force will land at Cap au Gris early to-morrow morning and will immediately push on after them. Colonel Krekel, from Saint Charles, has 200 men out. A force from Louisiana will be mounted and move from that direction. You are expected to co-operate from the west. Let your infantry be on the alert at Wellsville, Martinsburg, and Mexico, and push out with all the men you can mount. They will certainly try to get past you to Rocheport; bag them if possible. Report action at once.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEXICO, October 26, 1864-9.35 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonels Holmes and Forbes were twelve miles north of here yesterday morning after Colonel McDaniel and Majors. McDaniel was moving fast with 400 men. Colonel Holmes was three miles behind him when last heard from. I have but a small force here. Have 300 mounted men in the neighborhood of Rochefort, on the Missouri River. Will do everything I can to head off Dorsey. Have notified my troops at Wellsville to be on the lookout. Will have every man I can raise after him at once. What is Dorsey's supposed force? Please answer.

J. B. DOUGLASS,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 26, 1864-9.50 p. m.

Brigadier-General DOUGLASS, Mexico:

Dorsey has between 400 and 500 men. If McDaniel is moving east, you had better call in the 300 cavalry from Rocheport, unless they are absolutely needed where they are. Keep me informed of what you are doing. Colonel Krekel, commanding at Saint Charles, has been ordered to co-operate with you.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
