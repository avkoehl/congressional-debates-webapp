Making public officers depositories—Mr. Kin<i
Semite.
Mr K said the latter part of the second proposi-
tion, and the whole of the third, seemed to be
established by inference fiom the positions already
established, and the proofs already adduced The
only further proof that could be deemed necessary
on these points, was to establish the fact, that, at the
very time we were importing large sums of specie
under the encouragement of the wise policy of the
Executive, as it was called, w e were enormously
indebted, not only on a commercial balance, but
also for money borrowed m the very face of this
commercial balance against u«
Mr K baid, it here again became his unpleasant
duty to prove that the President was mistaken in
his, estimate of the amount of our foreign debt It
was important to notice this mistake with another
view. We would not act in reference to our tiue
situation as debtors, if we believed w e owed nothing
The President give  the estimate of oui foreign
debt in March la't, at thirty millions of dollar! 
The President could have had no unworthy object in
this under estimate, but still it is a mistake, and
one that should be noticed and corrected If the
estimate of the President were correct, the debt had
evidently been paid, and ov r paid He had seen
an estimate more thin two months ago, which
seemed reasonable, and probable in all its details,
which estimated the liquidation of our foreign debt
since the suspension 0/ specie payments at $32,000,000
We had been remitting specie, and exchange, and
shipping cotton ever since, and he had not the
slightest idea that we had paid and liquidated in
different ways, since March la-.t, less than forty-
five, and peihaps fifty millions of dollars and yet
tie find tne exchanges heavily against us He
hoped, then, our banks would not begin to expand,
and our people to over-trade, on the presumption
that Europe was indebted to us
Mr K said no one could pietendto accmaey a->
to the amount of our foreign debt in March lis!,
but h  thought he could satisfy the. Senate, that it
ev< lj species ol obligalionwtre taken into accomi',
it was much neaier one hunched and thnty than
thirty millions of dollars
Mr K then proceeded to furnish the Senate with
such evidence as he had to offer on this subject
In the first place, he took the commercial balance
alone for the jear 1830, as reported by the Secre-
tary of the Trtavury, at upwards of sixty millions
It semed, by the repoit furnished at this session by
the Secretary, that he estimated the commercial
balance which remained as a foieign debt, at ovei
thuty mil ions, and perhaps this «tateme it misled
the President, who took the Sec clary's tommet cial
balance of one yell foi the cntne balance al the
period refened to lie thought, hoyvever, that the
Secretary was mistaken even as to this commercial
balance for 183 G H^ seemed to have dcduclcd
thirty milhonsfrom the sixty (as Mi K supposed,)
for our share of the piofits of trade Mr K
thought not a cent should be deducted We had it
from Engh h accounts, and had too much reason
to believe the tact, that the principal aitides of
Anwi-'an exports declined fiom 30 to 40 per cent
betweenjuly 1835,andApnl, 1837 Hebelieved,
then, we had lost on our expoits the full amount
of profit, and perhaps more, and that the gross
amount of balance might safely be estimated as \
foreign dpbt against us loi the year 1836 alone
Mr K then proceeded to show fheanount of
money we had bonowed in Euiop° n the space of
one } car ending in the fall of lb36 As Etm pe
owed us noth ng on an exchange of commodities,
of course the amount of specie (beyond that 111-
c'uded m the statement of impoits) which we ob
tamed from them, ran t have been obtained on
credit, in seme f01m or ether It w~s impossible
to get at an> thing like collect official information
on this subject As iheic was no duty or pic hi bi-
ttern, either on exports 01 imports of specie, llieie
xias but little mention paid to it at custom houses
either in Euiope 01 Imencs Laigc bansci ,
whose business gives llieni 11 interest as well as
knowledge of loans and ^ptt c shipments, were the
only cla^s from which much mfoiiri ilion could be
obtained, and they rarely knew of any except large
and notorious transact ons A statement ir tele by
Mr Favott, of Paris, a ¡nan of ^reat research and
many   opportunities, hf believed ps  much  to be
relied on as any other This statement v. as made
m the latter pait (if he mistook not) of 1836, and
purported to be an estimate of the specie shipped
from Europe to America during the year preceding
the statement This statement Mr K read, as
follows
Statement from Frederick Fayott's essay, published
in Pans, m 1836, of the amount of specie ship-
ped from Europe to America in one year pre-
vious to the date of the essay
England, from documentary evidence,
say.....¿£6,041,666
Holland, two loans, forming together
¿«2,500,000, one-half shipped m spec e   1,250,000
In France, the indemnity 18,000,000 fr
and Hottmguer loan 14,000,000, to
gether         ...           -    1,333,333
¿£8,624 999
If the above statement be correct, (ancl it was
certainly more likely to be under, than over, the
true amount,) we had imported near forty millions
of dollars in one vear, besides the indemnity,
which, if the laus of trade had been allowed a free
operation, would have been more profitably drawn
for than imported Adding the above sum to the
commercial balance of 60,000,000, and we had
evidence ofabout 100,000,000, less only the specie
included in imports In addition to thi=, it was well
known, he said, that we had been issuing credits to
a greater or le=s extent, ever since the commence-
ment of 1834, and the entire foreign debt might
safely be put down at much more than 100,000,000
in. March last The debt being established, it fol
lows that the state of ou- foreign exchanges have
been false and delusive, and, having been effected
by the use of credit, bave been no indication of the
true balance of trade on a fair exchange of com-
modities, credit having the same effect on the ex-
changes as the sxportation of an equal value in
commoditip Mi K however, concluded this
branch of the subject by adding that it would not
be necessarv to pay the whole debt before ex-
changes would be equalized, a very large portion
of it having assumed the form of investments, on
which we should only have to pay the interest,
and, moreover, the nature of the commerce be-
tween the two countries will bear a veiy considera-
ble foreign debt against us, \\ ithout affecting the
exchanges
Mr K said that he hoped he had proven to the
satisfaction of the Senate, that the causes of the
picsent distress were not common to other commer-
cial countries, winch, in fact, had suffeied only by
their connection with us They had n< t over-
traded, over issued, nor had any speculative ri'-e n
prices sioilar to our own The causes, then,
must be located in our own country, and Mr K
said he would endeavor to explain when, how,
and by wh it agency, they originated herp
He then went back to ihe removal of the depo-
sites in 1833—a measuie that he had frequently
spoken of before, as having been productive of
much mischief, and no counterbilanc ng good
He had briefly noticed its agency in bringing the
country into its then present condition at the last
session , and every prediction then made had be-
come tiue, and each cause had operated in the
manner there -.taied, so far as they had been since
developed He we ulel only now say of it w hat all
admitted—that it produced a panic which g catly
depreciated eveiy article of home consumption m
the latter part of 1833 and part of 1834, whilst the
price of our exports was no* affected by the mea
s ire in the foreign market The immediate effect
was a rise in our foreign exchanges, and twtlve cr
fouttGcn mill on-% of specie poured m upon us
Tins efiect was not inticipated bv the President
as we could see by an exposition of ¡us views when
the measure was adopte I He had no more idea
of bringing specie, than he had of 1 iingmsr London
to America bv the removal of th= deposites Yet
Ihe fntnets of the measure immediately boasted of
it, as one of the happy results of that yvise mea-
sure, from which many and countless blessings
were to flow in upon ihe country Well, sir, the
currency was already full, if not ree'undant,' and
that this specie, thu« suddenly forced m upon us by
violently striking down the value of home con-
sumption, would displace an equal amount of paper
circulating m good cred t, was one of those strange
experimental notions by which people unacquainted
with the subject have been deluded, and our
finances ruined Paper must Jirsi be expelled, and
then specie will fill the vacuum, by a law of cur-
rency Expulsion must precede, and can not, under
such circumstances, be expected to follow, the intro-
duction of specie, which, instead of expelling paper,
will become the basis of further issues by banks,
if they be left uncontrolled by any restricting or
regulating power Accordingly, much of this spe-
cie went into banks, or was collected together
in the formation of new banks, the whole con-
tinuing to expand, and produce a speculative rise in
prices, which, by a reciprocating operation, pro-
duced still farther expansions, by a well-known law
of finance This, of course, produced speculation
at home and heavy importations from abroad, which
at last even extended to the necessaries of life Om
people being intoxicated by this delusive prosperity,
every species of property was embraced in the wide
range of speculation, which speedily reached the
public lands Eveiy one seemed to think it much
easier to get rich by speculating 111 land than by
cultivating it, and, by large land sales, added to
heavy importations, soon produced an enormous
surplus in the Treasury, which was distributed in.
a great number of banks There was a great
anxiety to recommend State depositories to the
people, and reconcile them tp the loss of the United
States Bank, by proving that institution to be un-
necessary, and accordingly they weie stimulated to
accommodate the community by the use oí the
public funds In this w ay banks were multiplied,
paper issues were multiplied, speculations were
stimulated, and produced that bloated and liseased
condition which began to mauift st itself m the sum-
mer of 1836
It may be necessary m this connection more
particularly to notice the means by which we were
enabled so long to keep up this forcing process,
and prevent an earlier reaction by the operation of
our foreign debt This was plain enough, when
the facts were known, though it had continued
long to puzzle the best financiers of Europe The
natural effect of the general speculative rise of
prices here, from a redundancy of oar currency
and credit, was to depreciate our foreign exchanges,
and produce a call for the balance of our foreign
debt Yet we prevented this, by sending them
bond^, bank shares, State stocks, and credits of
various descriptions, to a greater amount than we
owed them By these means we raided our own
exchanges and depieciated theirs, which drained
ihem of their bullion (a*, before intimated,) by
means of the credits they extended to us These
speculations at home had produced almost an un-
limited demand for money, and we would take all
their cash, as well as all their commodities, and
overbid their own capitalists to get them, provided
we cou'd make the operation on credit Thus we
continued inverting the laws of trade, and utterly
confounding the bank directors and capitalists of
England, until the summer of 1836 We find that
the bank director  then made the discovery that the
United States had been draining them of their gold
"on credit," and they took steps to prevent it, by
increasing the rate of interest in June to four and a
half, and m lugust to five per cent
Let us now return to the United Stales In June,
1Q36 the ruin threatened by so large an accumu-
lation of the public money, and the uses that were
made of it, and the unsound state of the currency
generally, was so manifest, that all partie-> tinned
m the opinion that something must be done with it
Afier full discussion and great deliberation, Con-
gress with uncommon unanimity, adopted *he law
lodistubute the deposites among the States Though
no measure could be free from objection, this was
certainly the wisest that could have b°en adopted
111 reference to the end proposed It depleted the
Treasury, and checked over issues, by a pubkc law,
with full notice, easy terms, and ample time for its
execution The Piesident was, unfortunately, op-
posed to it, and seemed determined not only to use
every means to prevent its efficiency, but to prevent
its operation on the western and southwestern depo-
site banks, wh ch, in fact, most needed Us opera-
