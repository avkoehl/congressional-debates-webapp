THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 8,
sidered very much in the light of the other
side of the ledger, the means on hand by which
we can meet them, or such means as may be
commanded from the revenues of the country.
Back of all these is a class of expenditures
which i_s usually too apt to be put in the front,
expenditures which eome not under the class
of obligations of the Government, not under
the necessary expenditures, nor under those
economical expenditures to which I have re-
ferred ; but they come from these feelings of
ours to deal liberally in the line of salaries in
the payment for public services. Into these
four branches the public expenditures of the
Government naturally divide themselves.
Now, sir, I wish to call the attention of the
House of Representatives, and through them
of th<3 country, to what must be denominated
the absolutely necessary expenditures of this
Government for the coming year. Then I de-
sire to show from what sources, so far as our
expenses are concerned, we shall be able to
derive the means to meet them. Now, to take
an estimate of the public expenditures to start
upon, no one, not even the chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, hopes to bring
the expenditures of this Government much, if
any, below the estimates. A Committee on
Appropriations that comes out of a Congress
having kept the expenditures down to the esti-
mates may well congratulate itself. Taking
these estimates without any reference to any
provision for the public debt, they amount to
$273,025,773. This is the estimate made at
the Department, without any reference to con-
tingencies or extra expenses, as the lowest limit
at which the expenditures for the coming year
can be fixed.
Now, I want to call the attention of the
House to what they have themselves added to
this amount:
Estimates for 1872-73, not including pay toward pub-
lic debt $273,025,773
To be added:
Omissions from estimates 51,500,000
Deficiency bill  6,200,000
Buildings in Chicago  4,000,000
Buildings in Hartford  300,000
B uildings in St. Louis  250,000
Buildings in Albany  350,000
Buildings in Indianapolis  100,000
Buildings in Quincy  150.00.)
Buildings in Trenton  230,000
Corporation tax to be re-
funded  2,500,000
Pensions dated back up to
and including 1873  10,664,683
Washington treaty  310,000
 ■ 2i3,574,6S5
Total  ¥209,600,458
The House of Representatives by its votes
has made these additions to the absolutely
necessary expenditures of the Government,
I leave out from the present discussion all the
reports that have been made from the Com-
mittee of Claims; I leave out all the reports
which have been made by the commission on
southern claims. Those commissioners report
that there have been submitted to them for
"material furnished in war" (for that is the
language of the act prescribing their jurisdic-
tion) ten thousand separate claims, amounting
in the aggregate to $20,000,000. I do not
take those into account; nor do I take into
account the claim for a refunding of the cot-
ton tax; nor the claim of the States of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois for what is called the
"two per cent, fund," amounting to at least
$1,500,000, which I must confess I do not see
my way clear to resist as a claim upon the
Government. There are other claims, sub-
sidies pending in committees, large outlays
pressing upon this Congress, upon which the
House has not passed. I include in the pres-
ent calculation only what the House of Repre-
sentatives itself in the passage of bills has
added to the current expenses of the Govern-
ment, and these, added to the estimates for
current expenses, makeatotal of $299,600,458.
Sir, I invite the attention of the House to these
items. If there is any one of them that ought to
be deducted from the aggregate which 1 have
submitted, I do not know which one it is. The
House has passed all the bills to which I have
called attention.
Mr. CONGER. I wish to call the attention
of the gentleman to the fact that the Commit-
tee on Commerce has never heretofore pro-
posed, and does not expect to recommend this
year, an appropriation for rivers and harbors
of more than half—indeed not quite half—of
the estimate.
Mr. DAWES. I understand that.
Mr. CONGER. That will reduce the amount
of such appropriations some five or six million
dollars below the estimate.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, I understand
that, and I propose to allude to it before I sit
down.
Mr. MOORE. I want to call the gentle-
man's attention to a statement which he makes
in reference to the increase of the expenditures
on account of pensions, which I believe he
estimates at $10,000,000 as the result of a bill
that passed this House. I think it is alto-
gether unnecessary to include that item in an
estimate of the probable expenditures during
this year, a3 there is not the slightest proba-
bility that that bill will ever be noticed at the
other end of the Capitol.
Mr. DAWES. I trust that several of these
items to which I have called attention will
share the fate which the gentleman antici-
pates for his own bill. If anything I can state
to-day in regard to the great aggregate which
the House of Representatives has here made
will contribute to that end, then much of what
I desire will be accomplished. The House,
however, is responsible for this aggregate.
It is true, Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman
from Michigan [Mr. Congee] has stated, that
so far as the appropriations for rivers and har-
bors are concerned they usually fall much be-
low the estimates; and he indicates that such
will be the result this year. Six million dol-
lars, says the gentleman behind me, who does
not seem to be in position to know as well as
the gentleman from Michigan, but who desires
to have his estimate in my speech.
Mr. CONGER. The estimate was for
$13,000,000, and the committee proposes a
little over five million dollars.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, I inquired of
the chairman of the Committee on Appropria-
tions, and I take the experience of a good
many years here, and making an allowance
for what the gentleman from Michigan [Mr.
Cogger] says, and no one will contribute more
than he to the reduction, still no one who has
been for any length of time here will contro-
vert what I say, that substantially the esti-
mates, when we get through, will be exceeded
rather than we shall fall below them. That
is what I desire to call to the attention of the
House. In the matter of appropriations for
rivers and harbors I do not think they will. I
think the gentleman from Michigan has given
the limit; but there is avast margin elsewhere
where the gentleman from Michigan cannot
bring his estimate to bear. All he saves there
upon the river and harbor appropriations will
be lost, and more too, when the final aggregate
comes to be made. However, I shall be glad
if this statement of mine does not prove to be
correct.
I show what the estimates are, and that
what the House of Representatives has added
amounts to $299,000,000, including not one
penny toward the payment of the principal of
the public debt, although the payment of the an-
nual interest upon the public debt is included.
Mr. Chairman, from what sources are we to
meet these expenditures? The revenues of
the country are derived from four sources,
which are stated in the report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury. They are from cus-
toms, from internal revenue, from sales of
public lands, and from miscellaneous sources.
Prom sales of public lands the House of Rep-
resentatives has taken the entire amount to be
applied to public expenditure, so that item is
out of consideration. The customs, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury estimates, will amount
to $212,000,000. In that estimate of the
Secretary there is an increase over last year of
receipts from customs of some twelve million
dollars upon the law of .last Congress itself
reducing $50,000,000. Whether it will be ulti-
mately more or less is a matter of estimate.
Last month, if that be taken as a criterion,
would indicate the increase will be more. Look-
ing, however, to the disturbances abroad, and
the receipts during the present month, it may
be less.
The Secretary of the Treasury, taking last
year and so much of the present year which
has passed, estimates the amount to be re-
ceived from customs for the purpose of de-
fraying the public expenses at $212,000,000.
The House of Representatives have stricken
from that, by taking the duty off of tea and
coffee, $19,292,093. They have further re-
duced it by taking the duty off of salt and
coal, which amounts to $1,709,845 ; making in
all $21,001,938, which will reduce the receipts
from customs, as estimated by the Secretary
of the Treasury, to $190,998,062.
Mr. CREBS. What does the gentleman
say the reduction will be on account of taking
the duty off of tea and coffee?
Mr. DAWES. Nineteen million two hun-
dred and ninety-two thousand and ninety-three
dollars.
Mr. SARGENT. What is the reduction in
consequence of taking the duty off of salt and
coal ?
Mr. DAWES. One million seven hundred
and nine thousand eight hundred and forty-
five dollars. The receipts from internal rev-
enue for last year were $144,011,176 24. In
that is reckoned $15,401,184 15 from articles
which are now exempted by law from the pay-
ment of any internal revenue tax. In that is
reckoned also a corporation tax of $2,500,000,
which is now admitted by every one has been
repealed. In that is also included the income
tax, which the Secretary of the Treasury esti-
mates at $12,000,000. We have therefore to
make a deduction of $29,901,184 15, which
will reduce the revenue estimated from inter-
nal taxation to $114,109,992 09.
The other source of revenue is what is known
as miscellaneous revenue. In its nature it is
a very uncertain item to rely upon. It arises
not from any source fixed by law, but from
incidental sources in the management of the
affairs of the Government. It is shown in the
balance of miscellaneous expenditures. The
Secretary of the Treasury puts down in his
estimate the receipts for the next year frora
this item at $18,000,000. The miscellaneous
revenue for 1871 was $31,566,736 53. Ifwetake
the miscellaneous revenue for last year to see
whether that much can be relied upon we will
find that the premium on gold of §16,594,502 68,
which accrued from the sales of gold, has all
gone. That may be one thing or another.
The Secretary of the Treasury himself takes
that out of his estimate for the miscellaneous
revenues for the next year. Look over the
list and you will find homestead and other
land fees amount to $645,923 17. They have
gone with the proceeds of the public land, and
they are not to be reckoned on. So they arc
not to be recognized. You also find " direct
tax," $580,355 37. That having been col-
lected cannot be collected again. You also find
"proceeds of Indian trust lands," $1,140,-
120 28—those being the Indian trust lands
that were sold by the Government, and which
went to the other side of the ledger. They are
no source of revenue for us during the next
year. Then we have "accrued interest, sale,
&e., Indian trust," $387,921 01. Then there
are "reimbursements" to the United States
for moneys advanced to meet interest on non-
paying stocks, held in trust for various Indian
tribes, $35,535. Take those out and you have
from that source $12,181,379 01.
Of course this cannot be figured out ex-
