line northwest of the railroad, which at once gave way, and the whole army retreated in disorder about dark, except some of Wharton's division, which formed a rear guard, and the brigade that had been on the left of the line. A few men and some artillery rallied on the hill in front of Mount Prospect and checked the enemy for a time. The army retreated rapidly. The enemy followed to Tom's Brook, where Smith's brigade of Wharton's division checked them, and they gave up the pursuit (see plate ---*). The retreat continued all night, and the troops arrived at Mount Jackson at an early hour on the morning of the 23rd. The trains were sent across the North Fork of Shenandoah Rivere by the bridge Captain Hart, of the engineer troops, had completed the day before. The troops remained in line of battle at Mount Jackson during the day, and the enemy's cavalry came up and skirmished and threw a few shells, but made no advance (see plate ---+). After dark we crossed to Rude's Hill and encamped (see plate ---+).

On the morning of the 24th we formed a line of battle on Rude's Hill and remained there until noon, the enemy advancing to the river and throwing a few shells, at the same time moving up on the opposite side of the river to our left flank (see plate ---+), and driving our cavalry back rapidly on the Middle road. We then fell back in line and in column, and formed again in rear of New Market, and in the same way, skirmishing and using artillery, we formed lines and fell back to Tenth Legion, where we formed a line late in the p. m. and held it until after dark (see plate ---+), when, leaving Jackson's cavalry on picket, the army followed the trains, by the Keezletown road, to Flook's (see plate ---+), Ramseur in front, where we arrived about midnight. Our cavalry was driven to near Harrisonburg. On the 25th the trains moved on at 1 p. m. to Brown's Gap, via Peale's Cross-Roads, Meyerhoeffer's Store, and Port Republic, and at daylight the troops followed, Pegram in advance, and encamped in Brown's Gap, the cavalry encamping between South and Middle Rivers (see plate ---+); the enemy came to Harrisonburg. September 26, Kershaw's division came up the river from Swift Run Gap, where it had crossed the Blue Ridge from Gordonsville, and, turning off at Lewis', joined the rest of the army in Brown's Gap (see plate ---+). The enemy's cavalry and artillery attacked Kershaw as he was about to turn off and he repulsed them, engaging their artillery also, which was across the river (see plate ---+). Early in the morning the enemy's cavalry came on from Harrisonburg and drove ours across the South River. Pegram's division was moved out to the angle of the Cave road, with artillery, and engaged the enemy, repulsing several charges of cavalry (see plate ---+); at the same time the enemy advanced up the turnpike, where Ramseur's skirmishers drove them back. The attack on Kershaw was simultaneous. Wharton and Gordon were marched out to support the others (see plate ---+). Wickham's cavalry (Fitz Lee's) was moved to our left in the p. m. to Patterson's Ford, to meet a reported move of the enemy.

The enemy's cavalry having spent the night of the 26th near Weyer's Cave and Port Republic, with skirmishers across South River (see plate ---+), General Early planned to attack them in flank and rear on the 27th. Wickham, under cover, was marched across South River at Patterson's Ford, followed by Gordon, artillery, and Ramseur, Wharton guarding the right flank of the movement, while Pegram engaged
