Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Our trains of artillery wagons and ambulances, with brigade of infantry as guard, are now well under way to the bridge, and the remainder of the corps is in readiness to start at short notice. I did not get the train started till just before 3 o'clock, owing to the difficulty in finding the road to the bridge, and as I had no guide I sent to General Russell, who was kind enough to send me one.

My wagons trains and artillery started from camp at 3 o'clock, and ought to be near your bridge now. A brigade goes with them as guard. Would it not be well for Major Morton to go over to the other side to put them in park.
