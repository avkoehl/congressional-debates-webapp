Lieutenant GEORGE O. SOKALSKI,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of Arkansas,

In the Field, via Pine Bluff:

General West has ordered General Andrews to escort 30,000 rations to General Steele. The large force of the enemy has been heard from approaching this place, but we have not heard from as far south as Benton. A reconnaissance is started to-day for Benton. I think this place should be re-enforced, as the command is not large and consists partly of dispirited detachments. The road I came on is very bad; it had been little used, and crosses many small swampy creeks.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DETACHMENT SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Little Rock, Ark., May 1, 1864.

Colonel DANIEL ANDERSON,

Commanding Post of Little Rock:

The general commanding directs that you cause to be detailed from Lieutenant-Colonel Black's command a scout of 1 commissioned officer and 50 men, mounted, with two days' rations, to be in readiness to move as soon as possible. The officer detailed to command the scout will, as soon as his men are ready, report at these headquarters for instructions. Captain Vance, [Seventh] Missouri Cavalry, is suggested as a suitable officer to be detailed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. T. BRUSH,

First Lieutenant, Eighteenth Illinois Infty., A. A. A. G.
