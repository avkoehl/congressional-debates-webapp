THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 13,
know precisely where Congress got any au-
thority to make a law which shall bind the
Indians?.
Mr. THAYER. I am not arguing the con-
stitutionality of the law ; but I take the law as
I find it, which has been on the statute-book
now over thirty years. It is not for me to go
behind the law. I leave that to my friend from
Wisconsin. โข What I said was this: Congress
at this session has put a proviso upon the In-
dian appropriation bill which repeals that pro-
vision of the law of 1834. It has declared
that no. portion of the annuities of the Indians
shall be withholden.
Mr. CARPENTER. Has that bill been
passed?
Mr. THAYER. It has passed, or rather is
in a committee of conference.
Mn CARPENTER. Rather it is not a law.
Mr. THAYER. I am discussing this matter
in reference to the action of the Senate and
under the presumption that it will become a
law." I started out with reference to that pro-
visiqu, taking it for granted that it would be-
come a law. I am discussing the action of this
Senate. It has declared, so far as its action
can go, that not a dollar shall be withheld from
the annuities of these Indians, no matter to
what extent they have plundered the property
of the whites.
Mr. CARPENTER. That is all right.
Mr. THAYER. Exactly. 1 take things
as they are, not as they are not, or as they
ought to be, according to the notions of my
friend from Wisconsin ; but such having been
the law, and the Senate having repealed it so
Jar as its action is concerned, 1 say that I for
one will demand of Congress so long as I
have a seat here ; not so long as I live, for I
do not expect to be here quite so long as
that 
Mr. CARPENTER. It means the same
thing. [Laughter.]
Mr. THAYER. I hope it may be so, and
I hope I shall meet my friend here as long as
that. [Laughter.] But I shall insist and
shall demand and shall vote for the indemni-
fying of the settlers for the depredations thus
committed upon them, because you have taken
away the light which they had to indemnify,
by the repeal of the law of 1834. Now I trust
I am understood.
Mr. CARPENTER. It is undoubtedly m.y
want of perception, but I do not see it yet.
Here we are discussing a question of justice,
as L understand it, between the white man and
the Indian. The Indian is not represented in
this Chamber.
Mr. THAYER. I think he is, by some from
the East.
Mr. CARPENTER. Well, he is not the-
oretically, and he is not practically to any
alarming extent. The law of 1834 is no more
binding on the Indian than an act of Parlia-
ment passed that year in England. It gave
no right, it could take away no right as against
the Indian.
if this tribe of Indians, or any tribe of
Indians, have made a treaty by which, on the
one pari, annuities are reserved to the Indians,
nilil by another stipulation deductions from
those annuities are to be made to meet these
depredations, that makes a case, and it is
proper to withhold them; but without such a
treaty there is no power in Congress to say
that the Indian annuities shall be diverted to
any such purpose. It is seizing upon a man's
property or upon the property of a tribe with-
out its consent. They are not represented
here ; they are not bound by our legislation in
any sense whatever; and that being swept
away, as it ought never to have existed, and
therefore is properly swept away, to maintain
the principle that the Government must make
appropriaiions for such cases, the Senator
must lay down and maintain the principle that
tin: (iovernmunt is an insurer of the property
of its citizens against all hostile depredations.
I! the Senator can find any authority of public
law, or any authority anywhere for such a
principle, he ought to produce it. Then I will
vote with him, if I think it is good authority.
Mr. THAYER. I will simply say that these
settlers had a remedy. This Senate, so far as
it is concerned, has taken away that remedy,
and I presume it will be taken away by the
action of both Houses. Then I come in and
demand that Congress shall step in in place
of that statute which did give the settlers a
remedy.
Mr. CARPENTER. I understand it has
not been taken away yet.
Mr. THAYER. I am arguing it prospect-
ively, that it will be.
Mr. CARPENTER. Would it not be better
to let this amendment lie over until we see
what the law is?
Mr. HOWARD. Suppose we see what the
amendment is. The controversy has waxed
so warm an d animated on the part of both these
Senators that my attention has been given more
to their speeches than to the amendment. I
really know nothing about that. I beg that it
may be reported again. The speeches were
good, but perhaps the amendment is not.
" The Chief Clerk read the amendment, as
follows:
Eor this amount, or so much thoroof as may bo
necessary, to enable the Secretary of the Interior to
paysuch claims for Indian depredations as ma.yh.avo
been established and allowed by him under tho pro-
visions of thesoventeenthseotionof tho act of March
30,1834, " to regulate trade and intercourse with the
Indian tribes," ยง17.000.
Mr. HOWARD. I hope that amendment
will be adopted. I shall vote for that amend-
ment or any similar amendment, because I
think it is a very efficient means of keeping
the peace on the frontier.
The Senator from Wisconsin complains that
there is no provision in this amendment for
compelling white men to do justice to the In-
dians and indemnify them for damages done
by white men. There are not many such dam-
ages. The Indian tribes have a very feeble
idea of properly. Indeed, as a general prop-
osition, there is no such thing as individual
property among the Indian tribes. It is all
held in common. Whatever they have, and it
is but little, is held in common, and there is
no such thing as private depredation upon an
Indian hardly. As a matter of fact it is not
true that many depredations are committed by
white men upon the Indians. The depreda-
tions are generally committed by Indians upon
white men, upon tho settlers. They go to a
settler's lodge and enter it, or enter his barn,
or his out-houses and steal hia property and
carry it off. They take his horses, cows,
oxen, sheep, pigs, poultry, anything and every-
thing that they see fit to put their felonious
hands upon, and carry it off and use it. That
breeds disturbance between the settler and the
Indian. It is to indemnify tho white man
against such depredations as these that this
amendment is offered; and I think it a very
just one. I think tho provision of the old act of
1834 is a very efficient means of guarding the
property of the white settler on the frontier
against the depredations of the Indians ; and in
many cases you will find that it is the only means
of rendering him justice.
Mr. CARPENTER.^ Will my friend allow
me to ask him a question ?
Mr. HOWARD. Yes, sir.
Mr. CARPENTER. Will not the same
principle upon which the Senator vindicates
this amendment make it the duty of Congress
to appropriate about eight hundred thousand
dollars for the horses stolen by Morgan in his
raid during the rebellion, and make it liable
for all the property taken or destroyed by the
rebels who invaded Pennsylvania?
Mr. HOWARD. Oh, no.
Mr. CARPENTER. I want to ask another
question.
Mr. HOWARD. Allow me to answer that
first, and then 1 will answer the next with
pleasure.
Mr. CARPENTER. Very well; ifyou think
that enough at present.
Mr. HOWARD. I do not see any analogy
between the two pases. Those raids were
acts of war, committed upon the loyal people
of the'United States. They were .simply acts
of rebellion, insurrection, and civil war; and
I do not understand that it is a principle of
public law that the Government of the United
States is responsible for all the damages com-
mitted by Morgan's band in the prosecution
of a war, although the war was illegal and
insurrectionary.
Mr. CARPENTER. Will my friend allow
me to ask him one other question 1
Mr. HOWARD. Yes, sir.
Mr. CARPENTER. Is the'Government
any more responsible for private larcenies than
it is for depredations of public war?
Mr. HOWARD. No, sir; I do not think
the Government is answerable for private
larcenies. That is not the case at all.
Mr. CARPENTER. If my friend will allow
me, this must be one of two things: it must be
either the depredations of hostile Indians, or it
must be private stealing; one or the other;
and I understand the Senator to say that the
Government is not liable in either case.
Mr. HOWARD. As I said before, the idea
of property among the Indian tribes is very
imperfect. Indeed, strictly speaking, they have
no idea of property. All the property belong-
ing to the tribe is held in common, and no
individual Indian can put his hand upon any
article of property and call it his; and we all
know, from the earliest history of the Indian
tribes, that they are accustomed to live by dep-
redations. They live a wandering, romantic
life, live by hunting and fishing and stealing
from one another, and stealing.from whitemen,
in a very great degree. It is a tribal habit, so
to speak; and in order to guard against that
habit and put an end to it, I think the tribe
ought to be made responsible for damages done
by their members upon the white settlers by a
retention of the annuities that would other-
wise belong to them. That is the old policy
of more than thirty years' standing.
Mr. CARPENTER. If my friend will allow
me a moment, I do not understand that ques-
tion to be before the Senate; but the question
now is whether we shall put our hands in the
Treasury and appropriate money to make good
these depredations. It is not a question now
whether the Indians shall be made to pay for
them, but whether we shall pay for them.
Mr. HO WARD. As to that matter, if Con-
gress have repealed the old protection of 1834,
the provision in the act of 1834 which did pro-
tect the white settler against Indian depreda-
tions and made good to him those depredations
out of the annuities belonging to the Indians,
I can see no reason why the Government should
not now protect, in a similar way, the white
man against Indian depredations. If they will
give annuities wholly and entirely to the Indian
tribes, without respect to the damages done
by these tribes on the settlers, then let the
Government make them good in other ways.
I hat is my idea, and that is the principle of the
amendment.
Mr. CARPENTER. One word more, and
I will not intrude upon the Senate again. I
understand that if these annuities are gfven by
the Government to a tribe of Indians they are
given for their protection, for their support, to
prevent their becoming public enemies and
levying war for their subsistence. Now, sup-
pose we make ourselves by our own volition,
because the Indians do not consent to it, an
arbitrator between the Indian and the white
nian,^ and appropriate as arbitrator all this
annuity to the private claims ot' white men,
then we leave the tribe just where they were
before, and we have got to give them other
annuities to support them, or we have got to
take the consequences, and let them support
themselves by war. So that all this talk about
paying for depredations out of the annuities of
