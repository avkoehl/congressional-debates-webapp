Have staff officers to select your camps. Arriving near Madison Court-House, select a position on the turnpike and at its crossing of Robertston River. Have proper pickets in your front and at proper distances. The commander of cavalry at Sperryville is directed to keep you advised of the movements of the enemy. It is presumed you will be able to get supplies near the court-house for your command. If not, you will have to send to Orange Court-House.

Most respectfully,
