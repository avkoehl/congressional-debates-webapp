enemy in this valley to-day or to-morrow. Further division of my small force might endanger both Staunton and Lynchburg. My orders from General Lee give me discretion. Telegraph me last news from Lynchburg and beyond. I will wait two or three hours this morning to hear from you and from present front.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Harrisonburg, Va.:

No re-enforcements can be supplied McCausland from here. William E. Jones ought to co-operate with him, if practicable. Butler and Gillmore are before Drewry's Bluff, and all Grant's cavalry on north side the James River near Richmond. Every railroad leading into the city is cut. The forces in Western Virginia and East Tennessee must provide for any emergency there.

Prisoners report their infantry and artillery as under marching orders at 7 a. m. yesterday. I have not been able to ascertain whether they have left Woodstock. The weather prevents observations by signal corps. My opinion is that the enemy has fallen back. Will ascertain to-day and report.
