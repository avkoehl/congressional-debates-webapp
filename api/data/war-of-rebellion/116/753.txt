Knight, Company D, First Thode Island; for Midshipman Wharton, Second Lieutenant M. A. Parks, First Michigan, for Surg. W. M. Page, Surg. W. H.

I suppose Butt and Dalton would also be exchanged against army officers, and if so try to get them and we will send equivalents. I thought, however, that one of them was to be released in exchange for Abbott.

I trust you will spare no effort to get back our officrs.

Your obedient servant,
