HAMILTON GRAY, Maysville:

Morgan crossed the Little Miami at Miamiville, and is now making for the river. He says he means to cross at your place. Don't allow him to do it. Destroy all means of crossing. Our cavalry is close after him, and troops will be sent up the river; also gunboats. How many gunboats reached your place?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

HAMILTON, July 14, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

General Hobson passed through New Baltimore this morning at 8 o'clock. Enemy 8 to 10 miles in advance. Lieutenant Eadie, of picket guard, saw and talked with General Hobson at that place.

Colonel NEFF:

Let us know what you can learn of the route between you and us. The camp must be held. Morgan's men are reported worn out, and have everywhere avoided a post where a thousand men make a bold stand. General Burnside is endeavoring to get re-enforcements ready for you. Will let you know if they start.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 14, 1863-1.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel NEFF, Camp Dennison:

There are reports of some rebels passing east, near Glendale, which we think worth mentioning, to put you on your guard. Send out scouts in that direction, and collect information and give us the result.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
