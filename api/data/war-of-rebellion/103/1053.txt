Major-General MAURY,

Mobile:

"D" telegraphs me that the enemy's advance guard passed the head of the bayou about 9 o'clock, and the rear guard about sunset yesterday. They had seventy-nine wagons and about seven days' provisions. Are to meet General Steele in Pensacola with the rest of the army. No negro troops passed the bayou. Thinks they have from 18,000 to 20,000. All necessary orders have been given to Colonel Armistead and General Clanton. Colonel Armistead reached there last night and was ordered to take command in the absence of General Clanton. Fearing the enemy may turn down this way after reaching the railroad, I have detained temporarily Colonel Spence's regiment (cavalry) until the facts are ascertained of the enemy's object. All the balance of the cavalry are with Armistead, except 100 men at Greenwood, which will be withdrawn as soon as I ascertain the direction the enemy will take.
