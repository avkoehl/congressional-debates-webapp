measure taken to put an end to the disturbances in Raleigh had not proved effective, orders were issued which it is hoped be sufficient to prevent further disorders. I have referred to the Secretary of War your statements respecting particular officers alleged to have been concerned in the riot, and the matter will receive proper inquiry.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

Brigadier General H. L. BENNING,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

SIR: The President has been informed that in the recent mobs which occurred in Raleigh, N. C., and disgraced the fair fame of that respected State, Major Shepherd and other officers belonging to your brigade were prominent as leaders of the soldiers who participated in the outbreak; and all this, it is alleged, if not with your consent, at least with your knowledge of what was to occur. The Secretary of War directs that you be informed of these charges, that you require of Major Shepherd and other officers of your command who may be concerned a full report of all facts in this connection with which they may be congizant, and that you forward the same to this office with such statements on the subject as you may deem it advisable to make. I need hardly add that it is not designed to elicit from yourself or the officers of your command any statements which may tend to your personal crimination, but only to obtain such information as may properly be procured for the information and guidance of the Department. It is earnestly hoped that such explanations may be given by the offas will entirely exonerate them.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
