74________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.__________________Jan. 1841.
26th Cong......2nd Sess.                                        Pre-emption Law—Mr. White._____________________                                  Senate.
The Constitution of tbe United States was based
upon a compromise of conflicting opinions The
tariff question, that almost threatened the Union,
was so settled, and wny should not this great land
question receiv e the tame blessing?
I would here close my remarks and resume my
seat, but the Senate must pardon me for noticing
the political topic that has been introduced into the
discussion. I did hope, Mr. President, when we
assembled here at the present session, that we
would, by common consent, exel ide from these
halls all the political heat that was created in the
late political contest. We have all heard enough
of it to need repose now it is over But in this I
have been disappointed. The very title of the bill
introduces the log cabin as a political reminiscence
calculated to lead to political discussion, indeed, it
has so led some of the Senators who have ad
dressed you I did suppose that the charges that
have been made in the heated partisan presses, that
the late Presidential election was influenced by
stock-jobbing considerations in England, would not
have found their way into this august body. But
here, again, I have been mistaken And since the
charge has bean made, I desire to know what St^te
has been so operated upon L°t the charge be lo-
cated. For my State nrd her citizens I repel it.
I had seen in the columns of the parly presses, im
mediately after the election for President, the
charge that the election had been carried by fraud
This we had a right to expect, f jr it is a principle
in our nature to attribute our defeat to any thing
else than a defect m our«elves or our conduct, and,
so long at the charga had no Fpeeial locaiion, I
thought it but the privi'ege of the defeated party to
excuse themselves, even at the expense of fac & and
of the feelings of their opponents but, to my utter
astom.hment, I saw in lb* official organ the loca- |
lion of this fraud in my own State I had been
there at the time of the election, hid heard and
seen much, and I now declare to you that I hone tly
believe theie never was a mow fair and honest ex
pression of pub'ic opinion in the State than there
was at the elections there last summer and autumn
There may have been illegal vo  i given, and no
doubt were, but, if s0,I havegiod reason to b lieve
they were unknown totbejuJg s and Mipectors,
and were not cenhned to one side alune.
I am aware 'hat an argument has been based on
the fact that there were more votes given in August
and November than there were polls assessed in the
spring Admit this to be true, and does it prove
that the excels were i legal vet s,oc that they were
all cast on one sii<>? Oi may it not rather be nlia-
buted to the fact that all the pells were not tak^n
by the assessors in the ■-puns, or that some may
have come ol age bttwee n the time of th^ assess-
ment and the election? This would be the cbania
ble view of the matter. Add to this the fac that
th<*se same assessors accidentally returned "2,235,
906 acres of land less toan the true Amount," and
then make the calculation, *nJ you will find that
the vote of Indiana does not bear a higher propor
lion to the population than an average of other
States, and it seems to me that even the Official
would consent to raise the float irum Indiana, and
seek some other point of location It does not be-
come me to «ay wnat was the cause of the defeat of
the Administration party at the late tlectioti. The
Senator from Arkansas and myself said a few
words on that subject at the commencement of my
remark  Still 1 may be permuted to say, without
departing from (he course of remark I have laid
down for myself, that I attnbu'e ihe result to the
fact that tho-e in power lived too far from the peo-
ple, knew too Utile of their interest, cared loo little
for their wi<hes, pressed upon tne country obnoxious
measures, attempted to entrench themselves in
power by the application of doctrines with which
the great body of the people had no sympathy, and
treated with disdain, contempt, slander, and abuse,
the candidate of iheir choic. While tbe warning
rebuke has been pronounced m tone? cf thunder,
it has been both solemn and instructive. It has
proclaimed to the world the power of the ballot-box,
and the perpetuity of ourglonoue form of Govern-
ment,
SPEECH OF MR. WHITE,
\                     Or INDIANA
In Se|«'e, Tatsday, January 19, 1841—On the Pro-
>         ' spective Pre emption bill
Mrf 'WHITE said. However imperfecly I feel
mjself ape to d senss this subject, I am conscious,
never Mess, that in deciding upon it, I occupy an
impartial position Indiana, in her progressive ad
vanees from a wilderness state to the dignity of
the fourth or fifth member of the Union, has
reached that period in her history, when she may hold
with a steady and an equal hand the «cales of inte-
rest between the old S ates and the new While, then,
I listen with most respectful consideration to abler
counsels than I myself can aspue to give upon asub-
ject whose growing magnitude has inspired veteian
Senators with such apprehension as even to justify
precipi tate and imma ure legislation, I sha 1 endeavor
so to record my vote upon the several propositions
before us as to secure to the new States all theequiiy
they claim, and to the old all the right which they
challenge, and to all the Siates an advantage of the
most momentous importance, to be gained, as I
conceive, from no other source than from the pro-
ceeds of our bountiful domain.
In our plan of Government, sir, simple as its ob-
jects and as well defined as its purposes are, many
difficult and complicated quest ons are constantly
occurring. They are chi°fly questions of power.
Oui conf dera'ed and at the same time Republican
principle, cur relations with the Indian tribes, our
partial system of domestic slaveiy, and ourprovin-
cial or territorial system, are all full enough of per-
plexities to put this experiment of Government to
its severest trial. Indeed, sn, parties havs a ten-
dency to organize fh-ms^lve  not so much upon
measures of policy as upon abstract ques ions of
cons'itut onal construction This tendency of paity
is greatly injurious,by produorg pohtcal sophisms
and refined theories, whit h override every practical
power for go id conterred by our Constiiution
The Hnrl question is not properly a question of
power, and yet inci'en'ally it it volve considera-
tion! of that cbarac er Over the public domain
which lies within the hrmti of the organ z d States,
Ihe United Siates seem to hivp something  more
than a simple property juris hction, or a mere pri-
va e (wnership This is proved by their right to
make laws for its conveyance and government, and
by their power to protect th^ir possessions, and to
deteimine all questi ns cencermng tl^e land> in
courts of their own creation Such powers are ap-
purtt-nant to a specie* of territorial sovereignty
I concur fully with Sen ttors who have ascribed
si great importance to the measure now before us
li we legard it meiely as a question of finance, it
curies a grave and serious import Not the least
among the hgh tuncmns of Government is its
powei to ra'*e and expend money Next to tne
power to declare wai, and t> plac under the arbi-
trament oí the swoid the life and fortune of ih"
citizen, the power to ruse revenue is the high'-t
prerogative of sovereignty Of equal importance
is it if we have respect to the question ol popula-
tion or settlement and of sccial organization
Thtse difficulties are increased by the mediuii
through which Senators thoiseto rcgard the sub-
ject While ihe S nitor from Missouri [Mr Bea-
ton] complains that we will not tieat the public
domain as a fund for revenue, the Senator from
Tenness e [Mi Anderson] 'ontends that h by no
means to be considered as a question of finance
Concuinng fully, as I do, with the honorable Sena-
tor who introduced thf bill now o i your table, in
the ¡he propne y of a p imanent p-e emption law,
I protest against Ihe just ce of the remarks with
which he accompanied its introduction, and to
which I 'hall have occasion hereafter to advert
My purpose now, is merely to r xpress ray regret
that a measure so interesting, and I may add bene-
ficent, as the final disposition oi our public do-
mam, could not be presen'ed to this body by the
dominant party, without a conjuration of influ-
ences well calculated to disturb the harmony of
our legislation—influences which have la ely been
aroused in the conflict of contending parties, and
which had expended themselves in the most con-
clusive demonstrations at the ballot box.
To one or all of these causes it is owing that our
statute book groans under the weight of enactment
in regard to the management of our land system.
S nee the colonial and agrarian system of Rome, no
nation hai half-such a complication of laws regu-
lating its domam It may well be conceived that
so extensive and fertile a territory would be a pro-
lific subj ct of legislation Our entire domain is
compu ed at 1,085 536,232 acres of land, to about
400 000,000 of wa ch the Indian title has been ex-
tinguished, and remains unextinguished to near
700,000,000 of acres Of this vast domain, about
seven ninths lies east, and two-ninths west of the
Rocky mountains As yet we have sold to indivi-
duals a little upwards of e ghty millions of acres;
aid if we add to that, grants and reservations to
States, individuals, etc there will still remain more
than nine hundred millions of acres in which the
United States has a proprietary interest.
Nature stamps upon these teeming acres their
u<es i or the abode of man, and for the development
not only of the physical but of the moral and intel-
lectual energies of the Caucasian race Extending
to the shores of the Pacific ocean, the retiring sa-
vage shall give place to th« Anglo Saxon, to illus-
trate m the face of the world, and upon the last
great drama where it can be seen, the triumphs of
civilization, of liberty, and of religion.
Already, upon a considerable part of this do-
main, have these great purposes begun their ac-
complishment. Of the territory above mentioned,
an area of about two hundred and hfty millions of
acres has been organ z"d into Republican States,
and nine more stars of virgin lustre shine re-
spondent in the galaxy of the Union.
T"e bill and amendments befoie us contemplate
a permanent and conclusive adjustment of the in-
terest of th United Sta es in this domain, and from
the general view which we have taken of its uses
and of the nataie of the trust with which the
Government is invested in re.ard to it, we are pre-
pared to di.cuss the several principles and details
involved in the bill and pre posed amendments
From the beginning of our land policy, settle-
ment and occupancy seem to have been Ihe object
of the Government It is true that largesses have
never been oroposed, nor bounties awarded, to in-
duce a cultivation of our wild domain On the
other hand the Government has, with all possible
expedition, from time to time extinguished the In-
d an tale, and ihrown the land* into market. The
Indian claim removed, no other obstacle has been
left by our laws in the way of settlement, no limits
prescnoed to he exploration of the adventurous pio-
neer The m thod of settling the Western lands in
compact ma^se , by townshios at a time, has been
always repudiated The Govern nent has incurred
no expen e to protect the settlements No gar-
risons or military posts have been established
upon our frontier with this express reference.
Ot the contrary, it has been left to the same fear-
less and hirdy spirit of individual resolution which
dared to encounter the obstacles of nature and the
terrors of the forest, to defend ¡he pioneers against
the marauding incursions of their savage neigh-
bors The rifle and the axe have gone together
into the wildcrnes , borne by the same hand The
mother has let the couch when her infant repose 1,
to uat-h over ¡ha labors of the backwoodsman
while enaaged ii his daly and loilsome task, and
ti Kive the first alarm against the treachery of the
Indian, and the hour of midn'ght repose has been
rendered secure only by the guarlianship of the
hunter sentinel
In such a way as this, sir, hive jour great tra-
montane valleys b«en settled, until now security
has succeeded to danger, and the akrms of a bor-
der war are drowned in the noisy tread of com-
merce and of sp culation The pioneer has borne
the dangers of tne adventure, shall he net reap lis
honors and rewards? Unaided, unregarded, un-
recompensed, he has latd m virtue and in peace
the foundations of several of your most pow-
erful States, strengthened the bonds of your
Confederacy, added new interests to your
commerce, augmented sources to your reve-
nues, secmity to your liberties and fresh glo-
ries to your empire. Will you now withdraw
from him your, patronage when first it begins
to be valuable, or rather, will you not confirm to
