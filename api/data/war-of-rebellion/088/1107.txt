beyond Reams' Station a mile, then found his force strong; have drive cavalry pickets to the Vaughan road near Wilkinson's. Will cross a force there toward the Boydton road.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 29, 1864-10.45 a. m. (Received 12.05 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

On the Vaughan road beyond Wilkinson's and toward the Boydton road the enemy's cavalry offer considerable opposition to our advance. The country is very wooded, making it easy for a very inferior force to detain us. I do not get much information from prisoners, as they are generally strangers in these part.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 29, 1864-12.12 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

My advance at Armstrong's, near Hatcher's Run, destroyed the telegraph line from Petersburg to Stony Creek, chopping down the poles, &amp;c. Where the Vaughan road crosses Hatcher's Run is a camp of 500 dismounted cavalry; these furnish reserves for the mounted cavalry. A brigade of mounted cavalry was met at the same point, and the force increasing. A strong effort is being made to reach the road (plank), but I do not think we will reach it, having tried as much as possible. I will withdraw to Wyatt's and try the enemy toward Poplar Spring M[eeting] H[ouse].

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

A few prisoners captured from the dismounted cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 29, 1864-1.45 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

My advance reached the intersection of works near miss Pegram's; there learned of a force of infantry half a mile beyond that, I presume at Peebles'. The presence of the infantry also made it impracticable. The road leading from Wyatt's to Poplar Spring Church is heavily barricaded and picketed. I have withdrawn my force to the vicinity of Wyatt's, and do not think any further results can be produced in this direction.

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.
