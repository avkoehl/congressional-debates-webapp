■might «av that the President had not the same right over do

¡am from Kentucky [Mr I nperwoooI was right, Old it not

clause of the Constitution providing that commissioned officers
¿hill either be appointed by the Senate or by statute i here
was no such distinction if the power exis ed m regard to for

Tf/here were domestic cases to whicn he would refer He
reminded the gentleman from Michigan before him [Mr How
4isp) that, prior to the admission of Michigan into the Union, the
"Presidentof the United states appointed tdo commissioners to
iwaceed to Ohio and Michigan, to investigate relative to the
boundary line between those two Sia es Was that a violation
■*f the Constitution! It must lest precisely on the same pnnci
tw as this—on the duty of the President to execute the laws,
Mid. his duty and power to obtain information to lay before Con
A. commission was appointed by Jackson, in many respects
analogous to the present, consisting of Messrs Van Buren and
•Van Ness, to investigate the Naval Department Another still
more remarkable case—on which there was great controversy at
iho time, because of its interesting and delicate relations—was
that m which General Jackson gave a commission to Kendall,
faenan officer of thoGovernment, to ptoceed around tke cuun
try to the various banks of the United States, to negotiate the
terms on which they would receive the deposites, m case the
Preeiaemshould decide to remove them from the Bank of the
"United States, and on those terms they were afterwards deposit
edinthe State banks Wtieie did Jackson get the power for
these appointments? If they did not violate the Constitution,
this did not
The gentleman from Kentucky was reduced to the necessity
not only of charging John Tyler with usurpation, but of tm
TyitBig equal usurpation to his three predecessors, damson, Van
- jtuten, and Jackson, and not only they, but Adams So that
íis proposition involved a charge against the entire living gen
etaaott of public men of having misapprehended their powers
Under the Constitution, and of having participated in this viola
Don of tile Constitution
If tie present generation of politicians had thus violated the
Censtitution, they had had good reason They were proceed
ingift the footsteps of the patriots and wise men that framed the
Constitution They had the authority of Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, and Monroe, for all these acts
He would not trespass on the time of the House to present all
the precedents he had examined, but there were somesostnk
Ing, so conclusively demonstrating the absolute necessity of
tills power, that he could not forbear introducing them Wash
iogton, in his sixth annual addiess referred to he fact that m
the four westein counties of Pennsylvania the excise law had
been resisted, and proceeded to stati what he had done in this
matter Mr C lead from the address in which it was stated
that a proclamation had been issued by the P.esident, accom
pamed by the appointment of commissioners to proceed to the
scene of disturbance He entreated the gentleman ftom Ken
tucky to put bis finger on that clause of the Constitution in
which the appointment of these thiee commissiotieis by the
President wat, authouBed That case went the whole length of
this question The gentleman from Michigan [Mr Howard]
told him that this was done by Gen Washington undet his polv-
eras commander in chief of the army
Mr, HOWARD was undeistood to mqune if there was not at
that time an actual state of wat -of insuri íction!
Mr ClJsHING The msuneJtion did not occur till aler
wards, and consisted in threatening acts tj the matshal m serv
Ing his processes, and the power oi the PtesiJent was the reve
rule power, if any thing and it was exei ed to enforce the excise
act, so that it was not done under the power of the Piesident as
commander in chief of the auuy If tin had beeu the case,
a military man would have been sent
Mr HOWARD was understood again to mqjire if there waa
not euoh a state of d imestir violence in Pennsylvania at the
time of the proclamation of General Washington and the ap
pomtment of the commission, as required the lntufetenre of
the Executive, by tho terms of the Constitution ol the United
States?
Mr  CUSH1NG Undoubtedly there did exist such a slate of
■violences out it was not war, or done under the war power, but
tinder the power of the duty of the President to execute the
Jaws Did the gentleman wish the President to execute the
laws on questions of violence, and not on questions of fraud?
He had another case—a cats which went to the very existence
of the Government He referred to the message of Jefferson of
¡22<1 January, 1807, in which Jefferson stated the fact, that, un
derstanding from correspondence that intrigues werecairying
«m ir the Western country for the purpose of violating the Con
«titution and inducing the subversion of the Union, he had an
pointed a commissioner (also a civil agent) to proceed to the
Western country to watch Aaron Bun Was this a violation
of the Constitution? If so, it must bo admitted thnt there was
no conservative power in the Constitution which wool 1 author
hse the President of the United ¡Mates between the sessions of
Congress, to take measures to pieserve the Government horn

Under leffirson's admimstiation there were various cases of
foreign com nission , of which a very curious one wis <he com

He found the authority of such precedents under more íecent

authorized to construct the cus om house at INew York Was

to employ the instrumentality oy which it was to be done?

Sum into this, or la'te it for granted, ami «move him withour

Mr Van Bu.en appointed a«peual ccmiriss oner to examine
the matter, who received the sum of $400 ¡.er month for the

Anomercase was that of the Paiama mission, which the
g ntleman 'rom Kentucky seemed to consider unconstitu íonal,
and in regard to which misapprehension prevailed
Mr UNDbRWOOD said fiom the use he hid made of the
document he had read in relation to the Panama mission Cm
which it was suited that the President of the United States had
accepted the invitation of the South American mission to this
Government to be represented m the Panama mission,) it might
have been inferred that he argued that the President thought
he had the right to institute that mission He had referred to
the fact, that m the message the President specially observed
the provision of the Constitution, by stating expressly that he
would take no action until Congress should first give their ad
vice and consent to the appointment of a minister, and next
make an appropriation for his salary T'ie whole of his argu
ment, from this position was, that the President hadnongtt
eittuito makethe appointment oi to give money by it, without
first having obtained the consent of Congress
Mr CUbHíísQ resumed The gentleman again presented
another issue He now affirmed that the Pi esident had no right
to pay the individual He (Mr C ) was not discussing the que 
tion of payment, but of the constitutional power of the President
to appoint the commission, and, unless lhat was the question,
there was no question at all
Mi U\DEBWOOD One of the commissioners states that
they had not pay enough to meet then expenses
Mr CUSHING What then? The question here presented
by the gentleman s resolution was, that the President had no
power to appoint the commission He asked the gentleman
whether the President had the powertnappowtthe commission
if the commissioners would perform their duly without payi
He was arguing the question whether, when Thomas Ewmg
signed that papel m which no money had been paid by order of
the President, he had violated the Constitution? The gentleman ¡
now told him candidly that he thought the paper violated the
Constitution, and they now t ame back to the question whether,
under the Constitution, the PresiJent had the power to appoint
such a commission?
He had referred to the Panama mission If he understood the
case, great injustice had been done his colleague [Mr Adams]
regardingit Hewould inquire ofhis colleague as to the facts
relating to that subject
Mr ADAMS said he never had had a doubt in his own mind
but that the Piesident of the United ¡Mates had the power, bv
the Constitution, to appoint diplomatic characters of any grade,
lcgularonrregular, foimal oi informal it was con amed in
theatticleof the Constitution which said the Piesident oi the
United States, by and with the advice an 1 consent of the Sen
ate, should appointand commission public ministers, ambassa
dors, &c , and had been practised from the days of Washington
He presumed I s colleague would come, in his examination, to
the case of Gouveineur Morns, who, in the first yeai after the
establishment of the Government, was appointed by Geneial
Washington without ihe consent of the Senate, to negotiate
with the British Government General Washington wrote with
his own hand a letter to Gouveineur Morn , then in France, au
thonztng hi n to entei m o negotiations w nh the Brill'h Govern
ment, and a letter of ms ructions and all this was done without
any communication whatsoetei to the Sriw°, until long after
it nad been transacted He beiievpo that was the first ms anee—
m 1789 precisely the same year in which this Coi erees first
met and within six months after Us establishment Washing
'on also made a «lmi arappointme tof Paul Tones, whom he
authorizedt treat with the Govemmett of A'giers for the le
deraptionoia number of American prisoner Since that nm*
during every Presidency, there had been comm ssions of hat
charactei
He did, at the time the proposition was male tolurn for the
assemblage of ministers from the independent States of Ameri-
ca, at Panama, (Congress not bamg in session at the time the in
vitation was lecetved,) authorize the Minister or the United
States at Colombia to accept on the part of the Un ted states
the invitation, but he did nothing to carry it intoeflect until the
meeting of Congiess, and it was the advice of all the members,
ol the Administration that this course of proeeedh g was most
proper, not simply on the question of the right or power of the
President to accept this invitation, but as a matter of expe
diency and prudence    Accordingly on the meeting of Con
gresB,heinfoimedthem that he had deempd it—and he had the
concurrence of allthe members of his administration in this—
within the power of the Executive to accept the invitation, but
he had not thought it proper to act without trre 'advice of the
Senate as to the appointment, and without an expression of
opinion by the House, who had the cortrolling power over the
public purse
That was his course of pioceedmjr on that occasion, not
that he hadany doub*—as he said to Congress at that time, as
he thought at this moment, tnd ever had—under the Constittt
tionofthe United teta es, and under the preceder t ofGenpral

Kentucky, [Mi I nderwood ] with this whole wnght ofau-
thonty and experience before him, making this grave question
at this time
If any gentleman would examine the first act appropriating
for foreign m ercourse, he would find full power for the ap-
pointment of ministers abroad An appiopnation of tM0,fJO0
was placed by it under the disposition ol the President of the
United States, to carry on intercourse with foreign nation . In
tliatact there was aa completely an admission of iho power of
the President of the United ¡sta'es to appoint all public minis-
ters abroad, as in the act establishing the Treasury Department
There was iheadmitted power of the President to remove or ap
point the executive officers of this nation He conceived that
the President was authorized to send a minister to Panama, or
anywheie else he should de ermine by the law—which was th 
law of nations, ard which authoi used the existence and pre-
scribed the power of public minister 
Mr Adams having concluded his explanation—
Mr FILLMORE rose to appeal t > Mr Ccshino to suifertlie
further consideration of thi  question to be postponed, In order
trat the House might take up and pass on the amendments of
the Senate to the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill
M  CUSHING said he would consent to do so in a few mo-
ments
Mr C said he was greatly indebted to his colleague for tha
additional light he 1 ad thrown on the subject He alwaysgave
them valuable information whenever he addressed the House
This would save him from bringing forward many of the cases
which he hadlnterdedto leferto
He would proceed to state what he apprehended was the
general principie applicable to llns matter, which appeared to
him to betheuue construction of the Constitu ion, and which
applied to the question of money as well as of power He laid
this down as a general rule, both under the Constitution and
the laws—that where the Constitution or any Jaw devolved a
duty on the President, or-any other officer, and did not prescribe
the manner in which it was to be performed the President or
other officer was to appoint suitable agents for its performance,
and for their reasonable compensation Congress were as much
bound to provide, as to provide for the expenses of this Gov-
ernment
1 he clause requiring the President to see to the execution of
the laws, and to give information to Congress of the state of the
Union, was imperative on the President, and constituted an
obligafion, by the omission of which he violated the Constitution
and his oath of office, and was liable to imf eachmem, and if the
Constitmion or laws did not set forth the manner m which a
du y was to be performed it was for the President to decide
upon it
The gentleman from Kentucky had said, if the President
might appoint these officers he might ar point thousands-
There was no power which misrht no! beabuaeu, but the abuse
of power did not argue the non existence oí power His an-
swer to this argument was if the President abuse his power,
impeach him If the abuse was a pecuniary question, the Con-
gress of the United btates had complete conti ol over the matter
It was within their jurisdiction, as had been contended in debate,
to withhold the salary
Thus on precedents, on the authority of every President of
the United fetates on the letter of the Constitution and on the
only principle of its construction by wh ch ihis Government
cou d live and maintain its vitalny, be man lamed that thl3 act
of the President of the I nt'ed States, was constitutional, that it
was not a viola ion of law, nor an act of usu*-} ation
He would briefly glance nt a other cor stltutional question
wh eh the gpntlemnn fiom Kentucky had interposed here, but
which was not pei tment to the sSue The gentleman had said
tuatnot only was Jo'in Tyler gu Hy of usurpation, but that he
manifested the spirit of usuipadon by bearing the title of Presi-
dent of the United States At this late hour it was a settled
question whether 'President" was the pioper title for John
Tyler or not B/tth Houses had settled it by the l votes The
first act the President was called on to perform was to decide
this question Before he could perform any act whatsoever as
President, he had to be sworn, and the mode of the oath involved
the question whelhei he was Piesident or Vice President of
the Ui ited Slates He did decide it and that by the concurrence
and assent of the (so called) Whig retiring cabinet, and it
had been approved by the entire Whig parly m the Senate, ex-
cept one, on a vote taken last session 1 he question had also
been decided at the last session by the House, and on looking at
the journal he found that when the gentleman from iVewYork
[Mr McKeonI moved the amendment mvohirg this question
he could not get gentlemen enough to give him the yeas and
nays on the question It appeared by the .ournal that nodivis-
ion was called on that question, and therefore it was to be un-
derstood that it was a unanimous decision that the true title of
John Tyler was   President of the United States "
It was not for him to look into the motive of the entire Whig
party in this decision whether it was infix the question aa to
the terms ofoffite nor was it lor him o look into the motives of
the gentleman fiom Kentucky who at this late day, had raised
the question But from thc«e facts -tha' now m May, 1842 it
