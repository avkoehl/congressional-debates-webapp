SUFFOLK, December 2, 1862.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

The interview with General Foster to-day was all that could be desired. He is an old friend, and we canvassed matters fully. Have memoranda which will govern moves for some days. I proposed to demonstrate strongly on a given day, which he did not expect, and which pleased him very much.

I very much desire that the new troops should arrive before Wessells's brigade moves.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
