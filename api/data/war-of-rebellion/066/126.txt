Commanding Dept. of the South, Hdqrs. Hilton Head:

GENERAL: I received yours of the 8th instant, inclosing copy of a note from General Hatch. It would give me pleasure to comply with his suggestions, but the reduced number of vessels in the squadron prevent me from efficiently blockading existing stations, and will compel me to withdraw from some of them unless speedily re-enforced, All the vessels of the squadron are very short-handled,
