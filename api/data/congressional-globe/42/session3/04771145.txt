own country, were due to the enterprise of our
ship-builders and merchants, without aid from
Government; but, self reliant, they made such
progress up to 1861 as the world had not
before witnessed. In the period embraced
between 1789 and 1830 they had built up a
total of registered and enrolled tonnage of
3,772,439 tons. In the succeeding ten years
it increased nearly forty-seven per cent., ag-
gregating 5,539,813 tons. There had also
been built upon foreign orders 349,915 tons,
which brought to the builders and added to
the national wealth the sum of $20,994,900.
During .this period of ten years the total
value of vessels built in the United States
amounted to $212,162,885, or an annual aver-
age of $21,212,628 paid to our mechanical
industries incident to and engaged in ship-
building.
So rapid had been our progress, that in 1861
we nearly equaled the tonnage of Englaud,
which, as before stated, had reached an aggre-
gate of 5,895,369 tons. In that same year
American enterprise, unaided, had carried its
commercial marine to a tonnage of 5,539,813
tons, the excess of British being only 355,556
tons.
I have already said that the British policy
relative to ships and shipping dates from 1381,
and that ours dates from 1789. This gives to
the British up to the date of which I am
speaking, the year 1861, a life of four hundred
and eighty years, and to our own a iife of
seventy two years, and shows as an everlasting
monument to the skill and enterprise of our
ship-builders and merchants that their com-
bined energy, unaided by their Government
had created in seventy-two years within six
per cent, of that tonnage which it took the Brit-
ish merchants and builders, with the almost
unlimited aid of their great Government, to
build up in four hundred and eighty years.
Mr. President, after making record of this
ever-glorious achievement of the intelligence
and energy combined in our ship-builders and
merchants, I wish that I could here cease by
saying:
"Thus having acquired for their country an equal
participation in that carrying trade of the ocean
which has made all nations possessing it prosperous
and powerful, these builders and merchants of ours
now move on maintaining their place and share in
the rapidly developing commerce of the world."
I am pained to say, sir, that truth compels a
different statement; a statement which, while
it humiliates, may yet guide us in the course to
place our country in her true position of hold-
ing again not only her now lostcairyiug tiade,
but adding so vastly to it as to place her in
advance of all her rivals. If the increase in our
ships, our carrying trade, and ocean commerce,
was without parallel, its rapid decline was none
the less so. This I will clearly show.
In the report of commerce ami navigation
for the fiscal year of 1860 it is shown that the
total shipping which entered and cleared in
the United States aggregated 17,065,125 tons.
Of this tonnage seventy-one per cent, was
American vessels. In the fiscal year 1870-71
the total shipping whieh entered and cleared
in the United States aggregated 19^907,666
tons, showing an increase of 2,842,541 tons
since 1860. Notwithstanding this increase of
sixteen percent, in the total tonnage, there was
a falling off in the American proportion which
we held in 1860, of seventy-one per cent.._to
thirty-seven and sixty-two hundredths in 1871,
and an increase of the foreign from twenty-nine
per cent, in 1860 to sixty-two and thirty eight
hundredths per cent, in 1871. In the year 1860
the total tonnage engaged in the direct trade
between the United States and the_ United
Kingdom of Great Britain was in British ships
953,154 tons, United States ships 1.806,580
tons, in other ships 77,043 tons; or a total
tonnage of 2,836.777 tons. 1 he United States
had sixty-three and six-tenths ot this, Great
Britain thirty-three and six-tenths, and ali
otheta two and eight-ten'hs.
In 1871 this direct trade engaged the follow-
ing: British ships, 4,186,871 tons; United
States ships, 1,103,642 tons; other ships,
292,617 tons; total, 5,589,530 tons. Of this
Great Britain had seventy-five per cent., the
United States nineteen and seven tenths per
cent., all others five and three tenths percent.
In this term of years the tonnage of the Uni-
ted States, from seventy-one per cent., had
fallen to less than one fifth of the whole, and
from the large increase in the number of Brit-
ish iron steamships to our ports the proportion
is still further reduced, but the accurate re-
turns are not yet published to give the exact
per cent.
The clearances of foreign-bound native Amer-
ican vessels in 1860, in the United States, were
6,165,924 tons ; the clearances of foreign-bound
native British vessels in the same year, in
the United Kingdom of Great Britain, was
1,335,862 tons; the clearances of foreign-
bound native French vessels in France, in the
same year, was 1,437,898 tons.
Our foreign carrying trade is thus shown to
have been then as great as that of England and
France combined.
In 1871 the foreign clearances of American
vessels had fallen to 3,706,945 tons, England's
clearances of English ships had increased to
12,691,790 tons, and France in the same year
to 2,212,000 tons, so that the United States,
instead-of being equal to both, as in 1860,
barely exceeded one-fourth of the two in 1870.

While we have in these twelve years thus
fallen off, England has doubled her commerce,
France has increased one half, Germany one
half, Austria has doubled, Italy increased
one half, and all the rest increased to a more
or less extent. The whole international com-

the United States has stood nearly still, not-

withstanding that she has a larger basis for her
commerce than any other nation in the world.
Had her commerce advanced with a prog-
ress equal to that of Great Britain, it would
have developed in its progression an amount,
during that time, equal in the aggregate to
$4,578,000,000 in addition to and beyond what
it has aggregated in that period.
As we had advanced more rapidly than
Great Britain, it is evident we could have
kept progress with her ; hence the estimate of
gain is reasonable, especially as during that
period our population had increased twenty-
five per cent, and our industrial resources
fifty per cent.
Mr. President, why did we not make this
advance? I have already shown, sir, that
England had then ascertained that iron was to
be, as she believed, the future material for
steamships; that she had advanced money to
her most prominent ship-builders to aid in the
conversion of their wooden into iron-ship-
building works. These works were just then
being stimulated to their full capacity to cre-
ate blockade-runners and cruisers to be used
against us. At the very time when the enter-
prise of our merchants was paralyzed by the
failure of the Government to protect their
ocean-borne ships and cargoes, our builders
were left unaided to compete with these works
so amply aided by the English Government.
This, sir, is the main reason we did not keep
up our progress, and the cause that the natural
development due to us, as well as that due by
our increase in population and industrial re-
sources, was absorbed by our rivals. This I
will demonstrate.
It has already been shown that in 1860 the
clearances of American vessels foreign bound
from our ports equaled the combined tonnage
of England and France cleared from their ports.
The following comparisons will show how this
advantage disappeared:
The American tonnage whieh entered the ports of
Great Britain from ports of the United States in
1860 was 1,174.991 tons.
In 1870 it was only  287,093
Showing a decrease or loss ofAmeriean
tonnage  887,898
The British tonnage which entered the ports of
theUnited States from Great Britain in 1860
was  522,201 tons.

ted States from otner than British ports in
I860   614.163 tons.
In 1870 it was 1,150,407
British gain    
In this direct trade we have lost 1,267,981
tons, while Great Britain has gained 1,642,459
tons, not only gathering in our losses, but
also the per cent, of increase developed in
international trade. This was accomplished
solely by the means afforded in her iron screw
steamships.
In the American, foreign, and British ton-
nage entering the ports ot the United States
from the West Indies in 1861 we held in
American vessels eighty-six per cent, of the
whole amount. In 1870 we held but twelve
per cent.
In the tonnage or carrying tiade between
the German States, Denmark, Holland, and
Belgium, and the ports of the United States
in 1861, the American vessels held twenty-oue
percent., and this in 1870 hud fallen to only
seven per cent.
In the carrying trade from France to the
ports of the United States we held in 1861, tn
American ships, eighty-nine per cent., and
this in 1870 sunk to twenty-two per cent.
