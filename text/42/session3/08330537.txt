Mr. President, I am perfectly willing that
the State of Nevada or the State of California
should direct the greater force of its efforts in
the establishment of this college toward the
industries which are peculiar to those States.
I have no doubt it will be done in every State
of the Union ; that the characteristic of the
several colleges will depend upon the particu-
lar industry of the people of the State where the
college is founded ; and I submit that the act
which has been read by the Senator from Ver-
mont, and which I read a few moments ago,
is broad enough to cover this whole case, and
it is not desirable that Nevada should exclude
agriculture from the college, although it may
make it a matter of entirely minor consider-
ation.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I desire to
follow the good sense of the Senate in the con-
duct of this bill. It is manifest that if it goes
over till to-morrow it will consume another
day. My own impression is that the Senate
are now ready to vote upon it. I appeal, there-
fore, to the friends of the measure to refrain
from further speaking and have a vote. I am
quite satisfied that three quarters of the Senate
are in favor of the passage of this bill, and I
trust that we shall pass it without further dis-
cussion.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive busi-
ness.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I hope not.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion of the Senator from Minnesota.
The motion was agreed to; there being, on
a divisionâ€”ayes 22, noes 21; and the Senate
proceeded to the consideration of executive
business. After twenty-three minutes spent in
executive session, the doors were reopened
ana (at five o'clock and seven minutes p. m.)
the Senate adjourned.
