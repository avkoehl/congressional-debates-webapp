commanding officer of every passing train, and also send it to such places as you think best. I will send a copy to Bellaire. The general will go up this afternoon.

182 1/2.] COLUMBUS, January 25, 1865.

H. J. JEWETT,

Zanesville:

Your dispatch received. Mr. Lough is doing all that can be done here. Are there other points where damage is being done?

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

183.] CINCINNATI, January 23, 1865. -6. 15 p. m.

THOMAS M. LOWE,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

183 1/2.] CINCINNATI, January 24, 1865-10 a. m.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Baltimore:

Your two dispatches of 1 and 8 p. m. yesterday just received. I sent you two dispatches yesterday. Weather entirely forbidding sending troops up by boat. Have sent to this hour 12,000 by Columbus. Have about 8,000 here. Shall only send, say, 4,000 to-day in order not to cumber you too much at Wheeling. Balance to-morrow. As we have coffee and everything arranged and running well by Columbus, it does not seem best to send any Parkersburg by rail. I hope this will not disappoint you. Lough has been instructed and informs me he does constantly advise Wheeling of the movement of every train passing Columbus. I hear no complaint from Mr. Ford of any lack of information. Considerating weather and everything, we are getting along wonderfully well.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

184.] CINCINNATI, January 24, 1865-10. 30 a. m.

E. W. WOODWARD,

Superintendent, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Please instruct one of your agents to telegraph Wheeling of the departure of every train with the number of cars with men and horses.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
