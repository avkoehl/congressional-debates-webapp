Lieutenant Colonel LEWIS RICHMOND, A. A. G., Ninth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that in my tour of duty of yesterday as general of the trenches I found the several commands intent upon their duty. Nothing unusual occurred, the policing was attended to so far as possible, taking into consideration the weather. The sanitary condition of the camps and trenches would be much improved did company and regimental commanders exercise more care. From standing water some of the covered ways were rendered nearly impassable. I would most respectfully suggest that in constructing covered ways and trenches that attention should be given to drainage, so far as consistent with the general object of the works. The enemy sent up a rocket about 10 p. m. It was thought also that last evening the enemy opened a breach in their front opposite the right of the Third Division; it might have been an embrasure. It is reported to me that the enemy station sharpshooters in the large pine trees opposite the right of the Second Division. Officer of the day for the Third Division did not report to me.

I have the honor to be, most respectfully and obediently,

J. P. GOULD,
