Glorious news. It will be so foggy at daylight that we cannot see what to fire at. May I say 8 a.m. to-morrow instead of daybreak?

DUTCH GAP, VA., September 23, 1864.

Colonel HENRY L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy have made very poor practice at the canal to-day, hurting no one. They opened with sharpshooters this a.m., firing at every one who passed along the bank. A few shells from the mortars caused them to cease. They were driven out of their battery in the field this afternoon, and commenced firing from the old position in the point of woods. A disposition is manifested on the part of some in charge of the excavation to abandon the work. Can see no manner of reason for doing so. Have been here three weeks and have found no hotter place than our right mortar battery. Took occasion to speak very plainly to the man in charge of the digging (a citizen) to-day; spoke just what I thought. There are more persons frightened than hurt in this locality. Shall take care of the prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
