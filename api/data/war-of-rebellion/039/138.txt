Numbers 1. Reports of Major General Robert H. Milroy, U. S. Army, commanding Second Division, Eighth Army Corps.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 29, 1863.

General Elliott arrived at Strasburg at 4 p. m. yesterday. Had an engagement with the enemy at Fisher's Hill, 2 miles beyond Strasburg, and repulsed him with considerable loss. Our loss, 8 killed and 6 wounded. He remained there last night, but will come down to-day. Had I any assurance that our forces would occupy Loudoun and Fauquier, so as to prevent the enemy from flanking me by way of Front Royal, I would occupy Strasburg permanently.

Major-General.

General Elliott returned to-day, bringing in 20 prisoners, including 1 lieutenant. I learned from the prisoners, through one of my detectives I put in with them, hand cuffed, that there is one rebel brigade at Petersburg and five brigades at Harrisonburg, under A. P. Hill, en route for this place.

WINCHESTER, VA., May 16, 1863-11.30 p. m.

The Federal cavalry captured at Charlestown* were recaptured by detachments of Virginia and (Thirteenth) Pennsylvania Cavalry, under Captain Utt, this afternoon, about 3 o'clock, at Piedmont Station, in Fauquier County. We also captured 40 of the rebels and corresponding number of horses. Two rebels killed. I regret to add that we lost Captain Utt and 1 sergeant. Number of our cavalry recaptured; a lieutenant, 50 privates, and their horses. Major Adams, of First New York Cavalry, who arrived after the recapture, still in pursuit of the rebels. The Virginia and Pennsylvania Cavalry, who made the recapture, were sent out by me yesterday.
