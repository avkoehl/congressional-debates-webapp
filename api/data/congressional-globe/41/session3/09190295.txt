APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
295
41st Cong....3d Sess.
Bureau of Education—Mr. Casserly.
Senate.
It will be noticed that there has been a large
increase in the imports, exports, amount of duties
collected, number of entries, number of vessels
owned in the district, &c,, but a considerable falling
off in the amount of entries for exportation to the
Ited river settlement. This latter fact is accounted
for by the recent troubles in the Red river regions;
but as these have ended, the last half year shows an
increase again, and this will undoubtedly eontinue.
The number of immigrants arriving at this port is
now more than double the number arriving at any
other port in the United'States, with the exception of
New York, and the yearly records show a steady
increase. .
An examination of the official records kept at
Washington shows that the expeaBes incurred in
this collection district during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1870, were much lower, comparatively,
than those of most other districts in the United States.
For instance, the expenses of the Niagara district,
with less than one tenth the coast line of the Huron
district, were $3.3,844 28, while in this district the
amount expended was but $34,580 55.

Navigation.—Statement of vessels passing Fort Gra-
tiot, Lake Huron, during the searton of 1870, com-
mencing April 18 and ending November 20,1870.
The following tables show the number of" vessels
passing l?ort Gratiot light. Lake Huron, between
sunrise and sunset week days, during the season of
navigation, 1870, with estimates of the number pass-
ing nights and Sundays, making a grand total of
25,036 during the season. This table was prepared
for the purpose of showing the necessity that exists
for a harbor of refuge on Lake Huron, and the ex-
hibit made is certainly surprising. It appears that
an average of 110 vessels passed this point every day
last season, and this number will of course increase
from year to year:
