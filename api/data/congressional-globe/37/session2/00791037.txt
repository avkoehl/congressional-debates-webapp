RAILROADS IX MISSOURI.
A message from the House of Representatives
by Mr. Etheridge, its Clerk, announced that the
House had agreed to the second and third amend-
ments of the Senate to the resolution of the House
(No. 37) ill relation to certain railroads m the
State of Missouri, and had disagreed to the first
amendment of the Senate to the resolution.
On motion of Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts,
the Senate insisted on its first amendment to the
joint resolution, and asked for a conference on the
disagreeing votes of the two Houses. Mr. Wil-
son of Massachusetts, Mr. Henderson, and Mr.
Kauris wcie appointed the committee of confer-
ence on the part of the Senate.
OATH 01' ALLEGIANCE.
Mr. CHANDLER. The Committee on Com-
merce, to whom was referred House bill No. 294,
have directed me to report the same back, with a
recommendation that it pass; and I ask the unani-
mous consent of the Senate to allow it to be put
on ns passage now. It is simply to administer an
oath of allegiance to captains of vessels in the
mercantile service sailing to foreign ports.
There being no objection, the bill (II. R. No.
294) requiring an oath of allegiance and to support
the Constitution of the United States to be admin-
istered to masters of^\.mencau vessels clearing for
foreign or other ports during the present rebellion,
was eonsideied as in Committee of the Whole.
The bill makes it the duty of the several collectors
of the customs at the ports of entry within the
United States, during the continuance of the pres-
ent rebellion, to cause to be administered to each
and every masterof any American ship or vessel,
steamship or steam vessel, about to clear for any
foreign port or place, or for any port or place l!
within the United States, the oath of allegiance
required by chapter sixty-four of the acts of the I;
year 1861; which oath is to be duly taken by such j
masters before such vessels are to be permitted to
clear for such ports. This oath or affirmation may
be taken before the collector of customs at the port
frorn which the vessel is about to clear, or before
any justice of the peace or notary public or other I j
person who is legally authorized to admhjisteran ||
oath in the State or district where it may be ad- m
ministered. Any violation of the oath will sab- l{
ject the offender to all the pains and penalties of
willful and corrupt perjury, and he will be liable
to be indicted and prosecuted to conviction for any
such offense before any court having competent
jurisdiction thereof.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.
ENLISTMENTS IN THE REGULAR ARMY.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. I am di-
rected by the Committee on Military Affairs and
the Militia, to whom was referred the bill (S. No.
217) to encourage enlistments in the regular Army
of the United States, and for other purposes, to re-
port the bill back with two slight amendments. I
move that the bill be considered at the present time.
I think there cannot be any opposition to it.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
bill* It provides that it shall be lawful, underand
pursuant to such rules as the President may pre-
scribe, to enlist from the ranks of the volunteer
forces now in the service of the United States all
privates, not exceeding the number necessary to
fill the regiments authorized by law, who may de-
sire so to be enlisted in the cavalry, artillery, or in-
fantry of the regular Army of the United States,
either for the term of three years or for the unex-
pired term of their volunteer enlistment; and all
such volunteers as may be thus enlisted m and
transferred to the regular service arc to be entitled,
upon such enlistment in and transfer to tho reg-
ular Army, to receive in advance twenty-five dol-
lars, which is to be taken by them as part of the
$100 bounty to which, by law, they would sev-
erally be entitled upon the expiration of their
respective terms of enlistment.
Section five of the act " to authorize the em-
ployment of volunteers,"approved July 22,1861,
and section five of the act" to increase the present
military establishment of the United States, "ap-
piovcd July 29, 1861, are to be so construed as to
allow twenty-five dollars of the bounty of one
hundred dollars therein provided to be paid im-
mediately after enlistment to every soldier of the
regular Army hereafter enlisted during the contin-
uance of the existing war. The President of the
United States is to be authorized, by and with the
consent of the Senate, to appoint as many military
storekeepers in the quartermaster's department of
the Army as the exigencies of the service may
require, provided the whole number of military
storekeepers in that department shall not exceed
twelve.
During the existing insurrection and rebellion
each division of the forces of the United States, con-
sisting of two or more brigades, is to have the fol-
lowing officers attached thereto, who shall consti-
tute the staff of the permanent commanderthereof,
viz: one assistant adjutant general and one as-
sistant inspector general, who shall bear, respect-
ively, the rank of major,and whoshall beassigned
from the Army or volunteer forces. Also, three
aids-de-camp, to bear the rank of captain, to be
appointed by the President, upon the recommend-
ation ot the commander of the division, and the
appointment to cease upon the expiration of his
division command. Also, onemedical director, to
bear the rank of major, and to be assigned from
the surgeons or assistant surgeons of the regular
Army or from the brigade surgeons of volunteers.
The division commander may detail an officer of
his command, of the rank of captain, to act as |
judge advocate of the division, or a lieutenant of |
the command, upon the recommendation of the
commander, may_ be assigned by the President to
act as such division judge advocate, and he will
bear the lank of captain while so assigned The
officers are to receive the same pay and allowances
as are provided by law for officers of cavalry of
corresponding rank. Officers of the regular Army,
thus assigned or appointed and detached to staff
duty, upon the cessation of such service, are to
resume their positions in the regular Army, with
the same lank and promotion as if they had con-
tinued to serve m their own regiments or corps.
The senior officer of artillery m each division, in
addition to his other duties, is to act as chief of
artillery and ordnance at the headquarters of the
division, and to receive the rank and pay of a
major, if of a rank inferior thereto.
The first amendment repoited by the Commit-
tee on M'htary Affairs was in the twenty-fourth .
line of the.fourth section, to strikeout the words J
" or. appointed;" so that the clause will read: (
Officers or' tiie regular Army assigned and detached to staff !
ioer
duty, as above provided, shall, upon the cessation of such,
service, resume their position in the regular Army, &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment of the committee was in-
section four, to strike out, in lines thirty and thir-
ty-one, the following words: " and shall receive
the rank and pay of a major, if of a rank inferior
thereto;" so that the clause will read:
The senior officer of artillery In each division shall, in.
addition to ins other duties, act as chief of artillery and"
ordnance at the headquarters of the division.
The amendment was agreed to.
The YICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary sug-
gests another amendment, to make the bill formal.
The third section now reads: "That the President
or the United States be, and he hereby is, author-
izea, by and with the consentofthe Senate,"&c.
I he word " advice" is left out.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. That is
merely verbal.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That amendment
will be made if there be no objection.
Mr. SHERMAN. I would ask the chairman
of the Committee on Military Affaiis why he does
not report a clause repealing that section of the
act of last summer authorizing the appointment
of additional aids by the generals.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts That is on
another bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. It was said by the Senator
the other day, when the subject was discussed,
that he would report it on this bill.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts It is on
another bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. I want it somewhere.
Mr. WILSON, of Massachusetts. It was put
on another bill that I think we shall get through
in a day or two.
Mr. SHERMAN. I think it had better be on
this bill.
Mr. GRIMES. We have it on two other bills.
I have an amendment already drawn, and I offer
it here:
be it further enacted, That the act approved August
5, 1861, entitled u An act supplementary to an act entitled
1 An act to increase the prer.ent military establishment of
the United States,"' appioved July 29, 1861, be and the
same is hereby repealed.
Mr. FESSENDEN. • As that amendment pro-
poses to repeal an act, I think it had better come
in as the concluding section of the bill; and I ask
the Senator to withdraw it for a moment to give
me a chance to offer several sections as an amend-
ment.
Mr. GRIMES. Certainly.
Mr. FESSjSNDEN. I move to amend the bill
by adding three sections to it, composing the cav- '
airy bill as it is called, which has come back from
the House of Representatives. The first section
of that bill, as it originally passed the Senate, pro-
vided for a reduction of the volunteer cavalry to
forty legiments; the second section gave three
months' extra pay to the officers and enlisted men
discharged necessarily by the act; and the third
section provided for an examination of the officers.
I offer the first and third sections as they passed
the Senate, and 1 strike out of the second section
the words " and enlisted men," and reduce the
pay to two months. That bill has come back
from the House with an amendment increasing
the cavalry regiments from forty to fifty.
There is no reason in the world why the men en-
listed and discharged should receive thice months'
extra pay. Most of them have been in their own
States. They have not been in service at all. See
how it operates: we have a regiment of cavalry
raised in my own State, for instance; they have
been spending the winter at Augusta, the capital
of the State; they have been there receiving fifteen
dollars a month, and they have had their clothing
and their support, and have not been out of the
State. If they should happen to be discharged
there is no reason in the world why we should pay
them three months'extra pay. Taking those as
full regiments, I have made a calculation of what
we should have to pay under the second section
of that bill, which is merely giving away money
for no service in the world to men who have been
doing betterduringthe winterthan any other labor-
ing men in the community. Having leceived fif-
teen dollais per month and their clothing and sup-
port for several months, we should be just giving
them three months' extra pay for no service in the
world, and it would amount, according to my cal-
culation, to something like §2,000,000,if theregi-
