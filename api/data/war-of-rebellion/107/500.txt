EDWARDS FERRY, October 21, 1861-9.45 p. m.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

I deeply regret to report a repulse on the right after Colonel Baker's death. I have called on General Banks for more troops. The enemy were re-enforced at the time of confusion, and our loss is severe. We still hold Harrison's Island. I am withdrawing our left in good order.

C. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS GENERAL McCLELLAN,October 21, 1861-10 p. m.

General STONE:

Hold your position on the Virginia side of the Potomac at all hazards. General Banks will support you with one brigade at Harrison's Island and the other two at Seneca. Lander will be with you at daylight. Change the disposition of General Banks' division of you think it necessary, so as to send two brigades to Harrison's Island instead of one.

G. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

EDWARDS FERRY, October 21, 1861-11 p. m.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

We hold the ground half a mile back of Edwards Ferry, on Virginia shore. Harrison's Island has parts of thirteen companies, say 700 men, and will soon be re-enforced by 100 more fresh men, besides what support Hamilton brings. I cover the shore opposite this with guns, and am disposing others to help the defense of Harrison's. I think the men will fight well. Intrenchments were ordered this morning.

C. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General.
