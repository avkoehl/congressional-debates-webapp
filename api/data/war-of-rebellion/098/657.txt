Captain Alexander D. Haskins. Since the organization of this forage party the regiment has suffered but little from want of food. The detail has, with few exceptions, found sufficient to subsist the regiment. The party has captured horses to the number of 20 and mules to the number of 30; cotton-gins destroyed, 7; bales of cotton destroyed, 438.

I am at a loss to give the number of pounds of forage consumed by the animals of the regiment, but would say the animals have received full forage during the entire campaign, which would amount to 52,414 pounds of corn and hay, or fodder to the amount of 71,462 pounds. I would add that the subsistence taken from the country has been corn meal and bacon, with but a scanty portion of potatoes. Since leaving Savannah the regiment has drawn from the brigade fifteen days' rations of meat and hard bread. Coffee and sugar has been issued in small quantities.
