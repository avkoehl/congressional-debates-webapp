Colonel E. W. SUMNER,

First New York Mounted Rifles, Suffolk:

Report to Brigadier-General Gordon and await further orders.

By order of Major-General Weitzel:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., April 9, 1865-7 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Winchester:

A telegram from Richmond states that Mosby has his headquarters at Gordonsville, with a force of about 300 men engaged in scouting. Stoneman is reported to be at Wytheville, but I think that is a mistake.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WINCHESTER, April 9, 1865.

(Received 3 p. m.)

General C. C. AUGUR:

The Secretary of War sent yesterday a telegram from Commander Parker, Potomac Flotilla, containing statement of the [engineer of the] Harriet De ford, who says Mosby's headquarters are at or near Lancaster, on the Northern Neck. The general would like to know what information you have of the force there, and whether it would be advisable to send a force of cavalry down the Neck. The general does not attach much importance to the various statements he has seen, but presumes you may have some reliable information from the quarter.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS,Washington, D. C., April 9, 1865.

General C. H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Winchester, Va.:

There are four companies of Mosby's command in the Northern Neck, and they have been there all winter. The question of sending an expedition there from this department is under advisement by General Halleck. Whether it will be sent depends upon General Hancock's movements, and will not be decided until it is known what he is to do. It has been reported to me that Mosby's command has left Loudoun and Fauquier Counties, and I have 800 cavalry now in those counties to learn the truth of this rumor. It has been left to General Halleck to say whether I shall send a force to the Northern neck or not.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
