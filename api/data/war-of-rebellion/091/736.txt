(Received 4th.)

Major-General CROOK:

Captain Shaw tells men the block-houses are progressing very well. I will try and keep them moving. The First Virginia is till here. We have so small a garrison without them (less then 100) that I thought it best to keep them. Shall I keep it or send it back on the road? Is the Fifteenth Virginia coming back? Where is Benjamin?
