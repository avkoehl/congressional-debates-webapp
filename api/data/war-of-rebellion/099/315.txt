HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., February 5, 1865.

Bvt. Major General C. GROVER,

Commanding District of Savannah, Department of the South:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to furnish you with the following extract from a letter of General Sherman, dated February 2, 1865:

As to military discipline, I decide that General Saxton cannot go to a military post and do anything which in the judgment of its commander is calculated to produce disorder or confusion. The commanding officer of a post is the proper person to see that it does not become embarrassed with idle or worthless vagabonds of any color, sex, or kind. You may sustain General Grover in anything he may do as to maintaining good order and government at Savannah.

I am instructed by General Foster to state that the letter of General Sherman, from which the above is an extract, is of a confidential nature, else a copy of the whole letter would be sent to you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
