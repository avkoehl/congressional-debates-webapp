OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., May 5, 1863.

Colonel G. W. GALLUP,

Commanding District of Eastern Kentucky, Louisville, Ky.

COLONEL: Your letter of the 23rd ultimo speaking of the release of certain prisoners on their taking the oath of allegiance and a prisoner's letter of the same date have been referred to this office. The order referred to in your letter requires a report in all cases where prisoners are released on taking the oath of allegiance, but it does not confer authority on any one to release on any terms prisoners who have been committed for disloyal acts. The War Department has placed control of all prisoners of war and all arrested for offenses connected with the rebellion in my hands, and prisoners who have been duly committed can only be released by authority of the Secretary of War. All prisoners should be reported to this office with the charges against them, and the place of detention and of arrest and authority therefor. Please report to me the prisoners in your charge and who is in immediate charge in order that a list may be made out giving particulars as to the charges, &amp;c., and be furnished me immediately. I inclose herewith General Orders,* Nos. 32 and 72, of the War Department, which with current series, Numbers 9,+ from the Department of the Ohio, covers matters connected with prisoners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio:

General Burnside is the proper officer to inquire of in relation to the execution. Permit according to usage only immediate relatives and ministers to have interviews with prisoners sentenced to death, always in the presence of an officer. Interviews can be granted only by the War Department and General Burnside.

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

It is not probable that either the War Department or General Burnside will give permits for interviews beyond this I have granted, but
