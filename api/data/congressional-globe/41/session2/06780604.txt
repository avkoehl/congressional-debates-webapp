ances should be made for tho excesses into
which with seeming provocation they may be
hftrried, and pardon them when you recollect
how under similar circumstances you would
feel.
The efficacy of concession. Mr. Speaker, is
abundantly attested by eminent authorities,
both sacred and profane. It reconciles fac-
tions, removes animosities, lulls tho tierce pas-
sions, creates respect, and inspires confidence.
Nothing will tend to conciliate and harmonize
tho southern people more than the exhibition
of manliness and magnanimity on the part of
the Government, indicating kindness and re-
spect and love for her onco misguided but now
returned and reconstructed children. They
have conformed to all your demands, have
submitted to all your requisitions, and now
conlidently ask perfect anu unconditional res-
toration to nil the rights and privileges of
American citisenship. Her interests demand
it; tho welfare and prosperity of her people,
individually and collectively, demand it; her
all demands it: and above all still, the inter-
est and honor of th« Government likewise
demand it.
Why, Mr. Speaker, look at her condition.
Her fruitful fields, once laden with abundant
harvests, are untilled and go to waste. Cot-
ton, onee her monopoly and chief article of
exportation, upon which favorable exchanges
have ever been effected, droops and dwindles.
Her sugar, rice, and naval stores, hitherto
swelling your commerce and increasing your
tonnage, are comparatively unseen and unfelt.
All her industrial interests are languishing;
her commercial facilities are lost; her mag-
nificent rivers, that should circulate opulence
and turn the machinery of a thousand mills,
flow to the ocean unincumbered with ma-
chinery and unused by man. "The waves
break in solitude in the silent magnificence
of deserted wharves and shipless harbors."
With limited capital, unremunerative industry,
and paralyzed energies, she is no longer a
source of wealth and revenue to the Govern-
ment ; but, crippled in her resources, she is a
burden to herself.
This, Mr. Speaker, must result to a great
degree from that species of legislation which
has characterized the Halls of Congress for
sovwral years, which is discrimmaliug in its
character and repulsive in its effects, pro-
ducing necessarily discontent and alienation,
which distracts your counsels, which damages
the South, which debilitates arid endangers the
existence of our country. The South need
not longer be the "plaguo-spot," avoided of
all men, from which capital aad population
are driven by huv, but it is 111 the power of this
Government, by wise legislation and concilia-
tory enactments, to invite population, fill up
her waste places, cause her beautiful "sunny
South" again to "blossom as the rose." Other-
wise, Mr. Speaker, you may rear an Ireland
in your vicinity, with alienated inhabitants,
and a Hold, intrepid, generous, and enthusiastic
people, clot'hed with the iinimns 10 do mischief
and no power to do good.
With this record for North Carolina, and
these necessities of her people, I call upon
Congress for aid and protection. Let citizens
of North Carolina be relieved from these
unwnrthy political disabilities. Let, her have
the benefit, in this her time of great linancial
trouble, of the counsel and assistance of her
bestcitizens, of which she is now deprived. Let
her loyalty and her firm stand foMhe Union,
so h'Ug as there was a foot of Union soil adjoin-
ing her borders, and so long as the north wind
coul i come to her hills and valleys unpolluted
by the atmosphere of secession and rebellion,
plead in her behalf. And let her manlul and
proftipt acknowledgment of the results of the
war, and of her duties toward her sister States
and the Union, be taken as an earnest that she
is in full and perfect harmony with those com-
munities which are imbued with the true spirit
of political and religious liberty, and the
nationality, one and indivisible, of the United
States of America; and let her sons, purged
of theirgreatbatunwillingcrime, again mingle
in your counsels and join in the noble task of
regenerating and developing the great Amer-
ican Kepublie.
Then, Mr. Speaker, *'forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto
those things which are before," "let us have
peace." '• Give us peace," as was eloquently
said by the great Irish orator under similar
circumstances, " true peace ; peace founded
on justice and equality and national content-
ment, has an enriching, as well as a civil-
izing and ameliorating attribute. Peace will
pay you large import duties. Peace will con-
sume in abundance sugar and coffee and tea,
and every article on which a charge will re-
main. Peace will draw from (he earth twice
its ordinary returns, and while itshall give you
more food, will take more of your manufactures
in return. Peace will enlarge andgive security
to that market which is already tho best you
possess. Peace will open a wider field to your
laborious industry and your commercial enter-
prise; and for every benefit you confer 011 us,
for every indulgence you shall show us, for
every giftyou bestow, with a usury incalculably
profitable, by peace you will be repaid."
I vet us have peace, that the glad tidings
may go forth to an astonished world that, this
great country, so recently drenched in the
blood of her best citizens, so recently dissev-
ered, and contending with such Herculean
blows on the lield of carnage with tho energy
of despair and with the determination of
madness, is reunited in the holy bonds of
friendship and harmony, and will ever, hence-
forth and forever, be one and the same, united
and indivisible.
Let us have peace, that North Carolina, the
cradle of American liberty as promulgated to
the world in her Mecklenburg declaration of
independence of the 20th May, 3 775, may
renew her vows, and auspicating new omens,
may repledge her "life, her fortune, and her
most sacred honor" to "keep step to the
music of tho Union" and swell its chorus
the historic muse,
Proud of her tnia-ure. uiaivhos with it down
To Intent time."

On tho bill (11.11. No. 1538) to regulate the appraise-
ment and inspection of imports in certain ca^cs,
and for other purposes. ^
ill-. STJ'iVISNSON. Mr. Speaker. amkl the
struggles of parties and partisans, and the
clash of sectional claims and prejudices, it is
refreshing to turn the attention occasionally to
great, measures to "promote the general wel-
fare." And this Congress has considered none,
and probably will consider none more important
than the pending subject.' The object of the
original bill, out of which this has grown, was
to remedy an evil which has long been felt by
the people of the interior of the country; an
evil which lias u grown with our growth,"
unlil it has become almost intolerable.
It is the system of laws and regulations re-
lating to imports, which practically prevents
direct importation of merchandise to tho inte-
rior. and gives a monopoly of our immense
importations of commodities from foreign
lands, consumed by the people of the country,
to the sea-board cities, and with other conspir-
ing causes tends to concentrate that monopoly
in one city. So far have these causes operated
to this end that every other part of the .Re-
public pays, and has long paid, tribute to that
single city. I need not name her name j it is
in every man's mind. The tribute we pay her
is double aud treble ; for not only do we im-
port, but we also export over her counters.
Constrained to buy of her, we must sell to her
in order to pay for what we buy; and being
obliged to buy of and sell to her, we are com-
pelled to make her our banker; to constitute
lier, without bond or security, our agent, factor,
and broker ; give into her hands the key and
the purse, and submit ourselves her commer-
cial tributaries and subjects. This city by the
sea contains, perhaps, one fortieth of the
population of the Republic, yet nearly three
fourths, thirty-fortieths, of our national im-
ports and exports pass through her hands.
The following tables, from the report of
the Chamber of Commerce of New York for
1868-1)',), show the anomalous condition of

The profits on this trade may be estimated by
the statement of the report on page 108:
"In the above table wo have included, under tho
head of dutiablo, tho duty-paywig goods entered
directly for consumption, as well as those entered
for warehousing; these,with the free goods and spe-
cie, make tho total entered at the port. Thef'reo list
was greatly curtailed fix years ago, especially by the
(muster of tea and coffee to the list of dutiables, and
thus tho total of Iree goods imported remains at
about,eleven million dollars. All the figures referring
to tho imports represent onlv their foreign gokl cost,
freight and duty unpaid. To show tho co>t in oar
currency to tho consumers, the total .-hould bo
doubled, and the whole then increased about forty
per cent.: this would represent about tho selling
rates in our market."
By this rule the annual value of our import-
ations through that city in currency, iti her own
maiket, sold to her purchasers, for the years
1SG6, 1867, and 1808, was about seven hundred
million dollars, an aggregate in those three
years of $2,100,000,000, (she measure of' our
bonded national debt.) of which by the state-
ment of her own merchants her profits were
forty per cent. upon cost, carriage, and duties,
£200,000,000 per annum, an aggregate of
3000,000,000 in three years. Kxports follow
imports in almost the same ratio, and profits
| areprobably proportionate. These transactions
I draw others, ana that city has become the chief
