Accompanying the annual consolidated report of sick and wounded are tabular reports, percentages of the various diseases and injuries stated monthly by classes and orders (Appendix C*), and the percentages of prevalent diseases (Appendix D*) in each month. These papers are interesting, and worthy of special examination. They are the result of careful calculations made by Asst. Surg. J. S. Billings, U. S. Army. It will be observed that 74 per cent. of the disability reported is due to zymotic diseases and wounds, viz, miasmatic fevers and diarrhoea (51 per cent.), chiefly in June, July, August, September, October, and November; and to gunshot wounds (23 per cent.), chiefly in May, June, July, and August. So large a portion being directly attributable to the climate and an active and prolonged campaign, and the residue being traceable largely to uncontrollable causes, it is only just to remark that the conservation of the health and strength of the army has been accomplished to an extent that reflects credit upon its officers, and is duly appreciated by the men.

The purveying department, Asst. Surg. J. B. Brinton, U. S. Army, in charge, has kept the army well supplied. The steamer Planter and several barges are in use for that purpose at the medical department landing near City Point. Articles of hospital comfort and luxury purchased from the proceeds of a tax on newspapers have been dispensed by the purveyor graciously. The amount received of this fund since last report, $1,499.20; amount expended, $261.75; balance on hand December 31, 1864, $9,025.39; total amount received in the year 1864, $20,927.45; total expended in the year, $11,902.06. The abstracts of hospital fund, so far as received at this office, indicate in the hospitals in the front a fund remaining at the end of the year of $6,392.41; and at the depot field hospital at City Point, also incomplete (see consolidated abstract), $5,228.64.
