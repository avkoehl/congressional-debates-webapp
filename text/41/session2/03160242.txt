APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 29,
Ho. of Reps.
The Tariff—Mr. Marshall.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
of Congress after its passage the Secretary of
the Treasury reported that—
"We are beginning to realize the benefits of the
new tariff. By a freer interchange of commodities,
the foreign market is opened to our agricultural
products, our tonnage and commerce are rapidly
augmenting, our exports enlarged, and tho price
enhanced, exchanges are in our favor, and specie is
flowing within our limits. The country was never
more prosperous, and we have never enjoyed such
large and profitable markets for all our products."
Mr. Chairman, all along the line of history
the testimony is overwhelming that high tariff's
enhance the price of everything that the farmer
must buy, and at the same time deprive him
of his best markets and reduce the relative
and often the absolute prices of everything that
he has to sell; thus perpetrating upon him a
double robbery.
COMPARATIVE VALUE OF "WHEAT IN 1859 AND 1869.
The following interesting table, furnished
by Commissioner Wells, shows that white you
have added very greatly to the cost of living
and production, you have reduced by nearly
50 per cent, the purchasing power of one of
the most important of our agricultural products:
The following table shows the -purchasing power of a hundred "bushels of wheat as measured
by the price of various articles in the city of New York in the years 1859 and 18g9, respect-

The correctness of this table has been as-
sailed, but it is triumphantly vindicated by a
reference to the files of the most reliable com-
mercial journals. Indeed, the gentlemanrfrom
Pennsylvania admits that in the West wheat
will not pay now for the cost of producing it,
but, refusing to see the cause of our trouble, he
would aggravate our misfortunes by increasing
the tariff to give us, as he says, abetter market.
A protective tariff furnish us a better market!
"Why, sir, you have robbed us of all our best
markets. You tell us that the farmers of Illi-
nois and Iowa do not get remunerative prices
for their wheat because there are too many
persons engaged in agriculture, and that some
should turn to other pursuits. And this you
tell us while wo are living under the highest
tariff ever known in any country. And yet
you say that a high tariff will diversify employ-
ments and give us a market. Sir, you have
robbed us of our property, and now insult us
by telling us we ought to turn to other employ-
ments. Where is the money with which we
can turn to other pursuits? Your laws have
deprived us of it. Navigation, and ship-build-
ing, and railroad building, and the mechanic
arts furnish us with ten consumers of agricul-
tural products where manufactures furnish one.
Commerce builds our large cities, with millions
of consumers, and employs great multitudes in
navigation and ship-building. But these inter-
ests you cripple or destroy by your tariff. There
are hundreds of thousands of carpenters, black-
smiths, wagon-makers, coopers, and other me-
chanics and artisans, who are consumers of
agricultural products; but all these you tax,
oppress, and embarrass by your tariff. Give
us back the 40,000 seamen and laborers in
ship-yards whom you have turned out of em-
ployment ; give us back the thousands that
would be employed in building new railroads
but for your tariff on iron; give us back the
hundreds of thousands of mechanics and arti-
sans whom you have taxed into poverty; give
us back the markets of the world, of which
your policy would deprive us; give us back
equal and just laws and freedom from unneces-
sary taxation, and the farmers of the West ask
for no bounties and have no fears that they will
not have a market for their productions.
The effect of the high tariff upon labor in
the ship-building and navigation industries is
shown by Hon. David A. Wells very happily
in his report, in this way:
"It is also well when the claim to the maintenance
of high duties on pig iron is preferred in behalf of
labor to consider what amount of protection and
opportunity for employment is thereby taken away
from other branches of industry. In the ease of
ship-building this point admits of determination
with approximate accuracy. Thus the sea-going
tonnage that would have been built in the year 1866,
according to the average rate of increase from 1827
to 18o7, would have been 500,000 tons. Deduct the
amount built in 18G7,50,000 tons, and we have 450,000
tons, an amount equivalent to 600 ships of 750 tons
each. Atthe present ratio in England but 10 per cent,
of these would have been of wood. JBut to build these
000 ships would have employed for the year a force
of about 30,000 men, or more than two and a half
times as many as are at present directly engaged in
the manufacture of pig iron. To man these 600 s hips
6,000 men for the year would have been necessary;
an>d to supply them with chains, canvas, rigging,
and other iurniture would have further required the
labor of at least 4,000 more men. So we may esti-
mate that this protection to the manufacture of pig
iron by 12,500 men directly, or 52,500, both directly
and indirectly, in 1867, so enhanced tho cost of iron
os to deprive more than 40,000 other workmen of
employment during that same year, in connection
with the single industry of the building, equipment,
and sailing of sea-going vessels, to say nothing of
the construction of vessels for use upon our inland
waters."
And the small comparative amount of the
wealth of our country produced by the indus-
tries for which all others are taxed and op-
pressed appears by the following table, show-
ing the values created by the leading industries
of the country:
"A summary statement of the values created by
the leading industries of the country would there-
fore appear to be substantially as follows:
Agriculture $3,282,950,000
Cotton manufacture    71,500,000
Woolen manufacture  66,000,000
Iron production, pig and bar  119,950,000
Leather manufactures  222,600,000
Railway service    360,000,000
Fisheries  100,000,000
Total   $4,223,000,000
"This aggregate,deductedfromtheestimated gross
product of the country, namely, $6,825,000,000, gives
$2,602,000,000 as the product of all the industrial
classes remaining unenumerated."
44 Valueadded toproduct by railway transportation
The addition made to the annual product of the
country through the service rendered by capital and
labor employed in railway transportation has re-
cently been shown by competent authority to be at
the rate of about $360,000,000 on an investment of
capital of nearly SI,800,000,000."
And this does not include the $150,000,000
actually expended during the past year in
building 5,000 miles of railroads, nor the hun-
dreds of thousands of mechanics and artisans
throughout the country who furnish a market
for the productions of agriculture. The fact
is undeniable that railway transportation and
railway building alone do more to furnish us
markets than all the protected factories and
industries between the Atlantic and the Pacific,
ISXGLISIX TARIFF REFORM AND ITS EFFECT UPON- THE
PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY.
There is no more instructive study than that
of the history of British legislation on the tariff
question during the last thirty years. AYe are
not surprised to learn that the reduction of
taxation lightened the burdens of the people,
gave a new stimulus to industry, and increased
the productive energies of the country $ but that
with every reduction the revenues of the Gov-
ernment should be absolutely increased is a
fact that excites the wonder and even incre-
dulity of those who have paid little attention to
such subjects. The remission of duties on the
various articles taxed was gradual, and the
result is extremely carious and interesting, as
the following tables from reliable sources will
show:
In 1841 there were charged with duty 1,163 articles.
In 1845 1,052 articles.
In 18T>3  46f5 articles.
In 1859   419 articles.
In 1862  44 articles.
The gross produce of customs was—
In 1841 £21,898,845
In 1851  22,373.662
In 1861  23,516,821
In 1862  -21,036,000
British exports from the United Kingdom,
under the high protective tariff, were only, in
1841, £51,545,116 ; with these dutiesstruck off
the exports were, in 18G0, £135,842,000, an
increase of nearly 170 per cent.; and the ex-
ports have gone on increasing in volume ever
since, giving increased employment to industry
and increased prosperity to the people.
Sir S. Morton Peto, a well-known English
statesman, in his work on taxation, referring
to these wonderful facts, says:
"In 1842, Sir Robert Peel, by remissions and reduc-
tions of customs duties, opened up a system of free
intercourse with foreign countries which proved
most beneficial to thetradeof Great Britain, afforded
employment to our population,increased their m eans,
and consequently enabled them to sustain the cus-
toms revenue by increased consumption of taxed
commodities.'*
And again—
"Throughout the period that we havebeen making
these important changes in our tariff the customs
revenue has been buoyant. By tho extension of
commerce which has followed the remission of duties
on articles of import and export employment has
been afforded to the industry of the country, and
consequently the means of the people have been
increased. The natural result has been the increased
consumption bythepeopleof articles subject to tax-
ation, which at once accounts for the increased and
increasing amount of customs duties. This hasbeen
the great result of the policy of free trade initiated
by Sir Robert Peel. The result proves the wisdom
of that policy."
It is no answer to these overwhelming facts
to tell me that free trade has not brought the
millennium toEngland; that financial distress
and privation and poverty and pauperism still
take up their abode among her people. With
her crowded population, her immense national
debt, her lands all monopolized by the lordly
few, and the acquisition of a permanent home-
stead to the masses ail impossibility; with no
wide and boundless expanse of fertile lands, as
we have, for gratuitous homes to the impov.
