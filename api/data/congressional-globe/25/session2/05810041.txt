Reference of President's Message.—Mr, Murray.
H. of Rtps
ment hostile to it, with feelings unfriendly and bos-
tile between the people of the two extremities
Doe's any one supppose it can be maintained when
the time arrives (but he hoped it would never ar-
rive) when the entire population of one section of
the country, comprising nearly half the States, be-
come fully and deeply impressed wi h the solemn
conviction that the Union, instead of adding to
their security, is the fruitful source of danger to
their domestic institutions, their property, their
peac , and their lives'! He must know little of the
nature of this Government, and little of human na-
ture, who can entertam such an opinion Sir, the
strength of this Union is in the heaits and affec
lions of the people, in a settled, abiding conviction,
that it is a somce of security, a benefit, a blessing,
to all parties to it When this sentiment is gone,
the Union i , in fact, dissolved, and if it should
exist in name, it would be feeble and powerless
even for the general purpose  for which it w as
more particularly established
Mr N. said he had hoped, and he still hoped,
that this fanatical spirit of Abolitionism could be
allayed, and had been opposed to all agitation of
the subject here, believing that the better way to
quiet it He had been disposed to pour oil on the
troubled waters, to soothe rather than to irritate
the feelings of those who might be honest, but act-
ing from a mistaken zeal But he greatly feared
the evil had spread so far, and was seated so deep,
that it would not subside m this way, he feared it
would go on extending and spreading until it reach-
ed a crisis And this fear was increased when he
witnessed the efforts that were making to give this
question a politicol tu-n Sir, this battle is first to
be fougliL at the Noith, when 'he standard shall
be raised—-and he feared it had airead) been
raised in some of the States and he bad heard
that gentlemen of his own S^ate had been de-
nounced for votes given in anothei place—when
the standard of Abolitionism shall be raised as a
political s*andard, with the inscription upon it,
" we vote for no man who is not in favor of aboli-
tion," the evil will have reached its second stage,
and a fearful one indeed The-war will then have
commenced in the non-slaveholdmg State*, and
must continue until the issue there is decided This
will be a contest for the Union, m which th=re can
be no neutrals The Senator from IVassacliusetts
occupies a position somewhat different from hit
occupied by himself, although he would by no
means insinuate that he was an abolitionist, or dis-
posed to favor their mistaken views But he mav
yield to this spirit for a time, he may take the first
step and the second step, but he w ould finall) be
brought to a pause The Senator has alluded to
the disaffection that once existed at the North,
which, he sajs, passed off without any serious con
sequences, and the acti e agents m it became veiy
unpopular, or odious Mr N should not differ
with the Senatoi on thit point he believed that the
prominent actors in those scenes weic justlj ren
dered not only odious, but infamous, but the d in
ger then w as not o much in the designs, w hafe\ er
th y may hate been of the piomircnt leader-., as in
the state of public opinion, whicn was by no means
favorab'e to the continuance of the Unun nor an
any one tell what would have been the fin-1 issue
of these troubles, had not peace come as it did
He was m the midst of those trying scenes, and
knew the danger, but Hid not wish to dwell uprn it
here But the cases are by no means parallel the
causes of disaffection th n ^ ere the measurts or
the Government, which must, in their nature, be
temporary The abolition excitement springs frc m
causes which are permanent, and cannot be íe-
moved, nei'her is it directed against this Govern-
ment or its A.dmmistration, but against the domes-
tic institutions of certain States in this Confede-
racy
When this evil reaches. Us second Stage, to wl ich
it appears to be fast approathing, when it s at-
tempted to build up a political party bised m
Abolition principles, he should not hesitate to take
his stand, he would fearlessly oppose its advance,
■would contest every inch of ground, h( w ould re-
sist so dangerous a spirit of disunion, as he had on
a former occasion, and «hat little he possessed of
Character or influence, he staked upon the issue
NaV) mort, ie wohW stake upon that issue all that
he held dpar this side the grave—character, property,
friends, and life itsel f He was bold to declare that
he would defend the rights of the South, so far as
they had rights secured by the Censtitution, he
would defend them to the very verge of the Consti-
tution, and in so doing, should consider that he w a-,
defending the rights of the North, and the whole
Union We must stand or fall together, and the
only way we can hope to stand is, by holding sa-
cred and inviolate the rights of each and all the
Stales guarantied by the Constitution
Sir, (said Mr N) I will not undertake
to predict what will be the issue of this strug
gle at the North Fa a lime, \ery possibly,
the side of error may prevai' It was a sub-
ject peculiarly calculated to take hold of the
feelings an! prejudices of laige clashes of the
people it was a subject calculated to delude and
mislead But if the Abolition party should pre-
vail, and Ab lition principles triumph, we «hall
have thei reached the third stage of the evil, the
contest will then be brought here, and between the
different States of this Union Then are to follow
íeproaehes, criminations and recriminations, and
real or supposed aggressions offered and repelled ,
agitation, alarm and confusion may prevail, and
the noble fabric of the Government appear to be
falling to pieces This will be the final crisis,
which may filt the country with calamines, but the
Union will not be dissolved When the waters of
bitterness have spread over the land—when the
people have drank deep from the cup of affliction
—when they have seen and tasted enough of the
bnter tru ts of fanaticism, folly, rashness and pas-
sion— the good sense and reason of the people will
letii'n the d l i ion will subs de, and the dark
clouds whip i hiit, lo vcred over our honzoi will
gradually rii ipp ar until die sun breaking through
them shines once more on our favored lind Sir,
the Union will not be dissolved, although it may be
put *o a severe trial He felt a strong conviction,
an abiding confidence in this, but if ^e could for
a moment believe that Providence his oi dered
otherwise—that this Confederacy is to be broken
down—it would make no difference as to his couue
When driven from every other po-itioi, he would
make his last stand on the nmparts of the Consti-
tution, where he would m-'1 e tit last lallj for the
last struggle in its dpfence if unsnccessriil—if he
fell—he yu uld fall with the glonoi <;t-"idard of
the Union in his hind, and tp- v ords of t! e imp

Mr BAYARD move to s'nke out the wo>-ds
"the several States," and inseit the words of the
Constitution itself, viz "tie pe>p'e of the United
Stales" His only object w as to avoid i commit
til to a political ceed, to which he could not con-
sent If Mr C would admit th s shgit change,
Mr B would go with him
Mr CALHOUN objected tnat those vordswere
ambiguous, thev night be taken m a geograpmeal
sense, raean ng the nhab tints of th" nortnern
continent of Am°r ci or they might mean the
ppop'e as a people, or the} might mean the peo-
p'e only of the seyerM separate States The latter
w as the only seise he could admit
Mr BAYARD urged that the verj words of the
Constititio i, to which every Senator had swon,
could not surelv be objected to It appeared to hiri
that Mr C was conterdmg rather to put his own
peculiar írtc-pretation upon that instrument, lather
than fd'owiig the m-nrument itself, leaving the
i terpretati m open This he (Mr B) conterded
ought to be done Whj, he asked, should Mr
Calhoun refuse to take the veij words of the Con
stitutioi itself
Mr CLAY of Kentucky sad, if the Sena'or
riom Delana e would 'ranie his amendment ac
co ding to the histérica 1 fact, in the adopi on of the
Constttnt on Air C j\ wonll vote tor it The
hi-i nctJldtt w is, that the Consti ution vas adop -

Mr CALHOUN The Senator to estab'ish the
views of the other side has selected a passage tor
his amendment which is their whole reliance We
ielj on tie historical  fact  and  the Senator ftoji
ought not to  force his  interpretation
Delaware
on us
Mr BAYARD The Senator is much mistaken
if he thinks our view: are sustained only by the
preamble (of the Constitution ) The historical
fact is, that it ¡s ihe Government, m rae words of
the Constitution of ' the people of the United
States " It is so decided by Chief Justice Marshall.
When the preamble of the Constitution was "We,
the people of New Hampshire, Veimont," &c the
names of the several State" were stricken out, and
the existing expression inserted, in. order to avo d
all ambiguity I do not depend at all on the pre-
atibe, outc the discussion m the Convent on I
can demonstrate that it ^as regarded as a Govern-
ment emanating trom the people as a general body,
and on thissnbject I shall be ready to wield a lance
v ith the Senator on any «substantial occasion If
the Penatoi puts a different construction on those
words, be it so I ao not want to express any par-
ticular op n on on that subject

offered by Mr Hiynes to refer so much of the

ing the amendment offered by Mr Cushwq—-
Mr MURRAY being entitled to the flosr, said—

luctance 'hat I rise, foi the purpose of taking a
share m the discuswon of the subject und'r con-
sideration Nothmgbut a deep sense oí the obliga-
tions of dutj which I ewe to the people whom I
have the honor to represent, could at this time in-
duce me so to do As I have not, however, been
heretofore obirusne in debate, I hope the House
Will not consider me a trespasser on their patience:

Great pains s°em to hav e been taken to induce the
country to believp thit the recom nenda lors of the
Piesident m i cation to the sife keep ingot the pub-
lic morels, or, m other words, what lias been de-
nominate i tuc " Sub Treasnrj system," is ominous
to the liberties of the people, and fraught with the
most serious dingers Such as have not fully un-
deistood the nature of those recommendations, and
ire unadi i«ed as to the probable effects of then
opent on upon the country, should they be adop-
ted must have concluded, no doabt, from seeing
so many b tci denunciations igamst them, that
the system pioposed culd be httle else than some
fell measure of despotism Those persons, how-
ever, must be much surprised, when the1, come to
learn that so much of the Message as relates to this
subject, impl es nothing more ¡han Ihe safe-keep-
