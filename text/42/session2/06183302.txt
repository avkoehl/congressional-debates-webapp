But without anv rcforr-not. to what I hoy shmv
or what |hey fail to show, I assert before, thw
that the <hitv upon iron to day onp-Iit
nut to 1 io^one 3i,df of what it is. When this
duty was iinjio^rd the d'Miie.nd for iron ! hroti^ii-
out tlie world was not one li:df what ii is now.
'J he supply lh<Mi was ahead of the demand;
now the demand every where is far in excess

rap'dly than the supply can he furnished.
Kvenwhero abroad, in the manufacture of
the wages. Everywhere, in the building of
railroads, in ship-building, in the building of
houses, in the extension of industrial interests
of ail kinds that use iron, the demand for iron
is so great that it is impossible for the mills
to furnish a supply. Hence the great advance
in the price of iron all over the world, not
abroad alone, but in this country. In this
country there has been no material advance
during the last year and a half in the price of
wages or the cost of producing this article of
iron ; there has been no advance worth nam-
ing at all in this respect in this country.
Mr. BURCHARL). The cost of production
is less now, because the price of coal has
fallen.
Mr. IvERR. Yes; coal has fallen in price,
and in many other respects the cost of pro-
duction in this country is less than it was a,
year and a half ago. Yet the producers in this
country, just as fast as there is an advance of
a penny in Liverpool, Manchester^ or any-
where else abroad, rush up the price here,
and then come to Congress and demand that
this enormous protective duty shall be con-
tinued. And as this article of pig iron is the
basis of all the enormous consumption of iron
in the world, I say the continuance of this
duty is wrong, that it involves gross injustice.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The committee rose informally, and Mr.
Wallace took the chair as Speaker pro tem-
pore.
MESSAGE Fjioai THE PKKSIDKXT.
Two messages in writing from the President

TAKiFb' AND TAX T.TLL,
The Committee of the Whole resumed its
session.
Mr. KELLEY. It is sometimes well to
know what the gentleman from Indiana [Mr.
Ki'iiui] hays, and on whswe behalf h^sjaak*.
On ysterdn}' he d'-c'airned her-' in favor of
the elrccory monopoly, of tne two merchants
who nnpoit it. 1 am Mire that he dues not
speak for the great leader of levenue reform,
Mr. Iloiace Greeley, nor does he speak for
the protectionists of the Republican party.
I hold in my hand a paper which shows that
he does not speak for the Democracy of Indi-
ana, nor for the Democracy of his own town,
New Albany, Indiana. As a part of my re-
marks, I ask the Clerk to read an article
from the Weekly Standard, published at New
Albany, Indiana, of date April 3, 1872.
The Clerk read as follows:
"What is a Democratic tariff? One of the most diffi-
cult problems in political economy is the tariff. Since
the early organization of our Government this prob-
lem has been a prolific subj ect of discussion with our
statesmen. Those who favored or opposed the prin-
ciple of tariff have been able to fortify their posi-
tions with plausible and cogent, if not convincing
logic. Xhe history of the forensic struggles provoked
by this vexed and vexing question in our national
legislature and in our national politics is both
thrilling and instructive. After nearly a century of
experimental legislation on the tariff question, it ia
to-day an unsettled principle in our Government,
and will doubtless always remain so. Statesmen
and the students of political economy disagree now
upon this question as much as they did when the
first tariff was proposed.
44 It is admitted that the idea and practical result
of a tariff are selfish. If it bo a tariff for revenue
merely it is selfish in the fact that it is a tax levied
upon foreign commodities to sustain an alien Gov-
ernment. If it be for the purpose of protection, it
becomes a discriminating, selfish tax in favor of
home producers and makers.
14 Disinterested and unselfish motives in the con-
duct ot government have never yet been the rule
among tho nations of the earth, and until the advent
of the millennium need not be cxpected. Nations
like individuals generally take care of themselves
and then of others. The doctrine of free trade,
based upon disinterested and unselfish motives like
tho golden rulo, is beautiful and correct in theory,
but not susceptible yet of being put into practice.
"So long as nations like men, strive for the ascend-
ency the principles of government will be shaped
by no nice ethical discrimination. This being so,
each nation adopts such laws as will best subserve
its own interest and advancement. Tariff is tho
rule among nations, differing only in each in its ap-
plication. England boasung of her free trade, col-
lects a large part of her revenue by means of a
tariff, and by a system of imposts has become the
work-shop of nearly the whole world. Itisno longer
a disputed fact that our Government must have
a tariff system, the only question being, how shall
this system be adjusted? Shall it be a tariff for rev-
enue, shall it prohibit or shall it afford only inci-
dental protection? These tlueo propositions open
a vf I'le lield tor discus-noil.
* * The protectionists would insist that in order to
encourage home indi^try a prohibitory tariff should
he adopted. Uut tuch a tatiff yields no revenue
and tends to build up and sustain monopolies until
healthy competition forces them to divide profits.
" \\ ere our nation jurt beginning tho raco ot life,
in oidei to stimulate and encourage home manu-
facture, for a prudent nat ion, 1 ike a prudenL uian,
ought nut to employ another to do what it can do
itself, it necessarj, a prohibitory tariff should bo
resetted to until home enterprise eould sustain ltsoll
against foreign comper uois. It is true, at hrst sight,
Luis t-cems to be a haulship on the producing class,
com pulling them to pay home manufacturers gi cater
pnccs than ihey could puicha^e foreigu commodi-
ties lor. Yet rever.-e the scale and letfoieign pio-
dueers come into our market and undersell the pro-
ducts ot American fieids, and they would demand
protection.
"Ail men cannot be producers. If all men were
tilici- ot rhe soil in products would bo almostvalue-
les's for want of a market. There would bo no con-
sumers of the surplus. . .
"Accoidmg to our social economy and civiliza-
tion, tHcro will be and must bo all kinds ofaiti-
sans. and they inu.it, lie employed and fe j. Destroy
the woikshops, and the mechanics will in time be-
come a charge upon the altu^hou-e, or eHe must dig
a living out ol tho ground, and thus the famn'rs
would have not only more competitors, but also Ic^s
custouicis to consume their surplus products, liv
permitting tho commodities olfoicign woil^hopd
to nudei-eil tho^o r,f our own, they wiH be hank-
inpted and closed agamt home mechanics. Could
Ihi'-dand land upou our whait iron rails cheaper
than our own r->! inig-niil Is could make them, it is
plain that the Kngh.-h mi's would sell in tins mar-
ket, while our own would be unable to find a pur-
clniMn. How long could our mil Is stand such c<un-
pftmon? Thei e is no danger of our milN monop-
olizing the busimss of making iron by reason ot
tho tanlf. So soon as it \< understood that rolling-
mills p«y, other c.ipiiah.-ts will invest, m thera,
until a healthj euuipetition and reasonable profits
will be the lf-sulr. With rolling-mills, so it will be
with e\ei> other brancti ot mechanic industiyin
the land. Then tho tine policy of (ioveianient is
to so aujust the tariff as to pic\ ent t he ehoap hi bur
of otner countries tiom underselling American
Mveat aedmu-fje. Dv-sule on.-, t?o\eminent owes
aiiot her duty to A merican toil, and t hat is to lay no
tax upon those ioreign commodities wmth _do not
compete in our maikctwith Pkc commodities <>t
our own, tit u* ena o I nig the laboring men of America
to have ci.eap living, steady employment, and good
wages. Having this view of the tariff question, ve
indorse the last l)emocratic platform of tho btato
which declared in favor of free tea and coffeo and
incidental protection, and also indorse the votes oi
the majority of the Democratic members of tho
