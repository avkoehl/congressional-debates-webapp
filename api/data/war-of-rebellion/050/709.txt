On the 21st, we were in position near Rossville and on the 22nd, we occupied our assigned position in the lines around Chattanooga.

Captain E. P. Bates acted coolly and efficiently as acting major. My adjutant, Lieutenant E. G. Whitesides, was almost indispensable to me; his gallant daring was conspicuous, and his horses was shot under him. Sergts. Alson C. Dilley, Company C; Rollin D. Barnes, Company B; H. N. Steadman, of the non-commissioned staff, and Charles C. Chapman, of Company G, distinguished themselves for cool courage and capacity to command under the severest tests. I have recommended them to the distinguished consideration of the Governor of Ohio.

My casualties were:

Wounded.

Killed. Seriously. Slightly. Missing.

Justice demands that the facts in favor of 4 of the missing be officially noted. Two of them had just joined from hospital; 1 had no shoes, and on crossing a burning turf, on the 19th, his feet became so burned that he and the other two, not being able to keep up, were ordered back by their officer. The fourth one was left to take care of Lieutenant Barnes, which leaves the fifth the only case without excuse in the regiment.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Colonel, Commanding 125th Ohio Volunteers.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Brigade.
