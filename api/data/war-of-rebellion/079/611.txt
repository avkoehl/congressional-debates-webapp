you be kind enough to write to him and tell him to look out for me about Christmas from Hilton Head to Savannah. During my absence please confer freely with General Thomas, who commands in my stead.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SMITHLAND, KY., November 2, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch just received. I will re-enforce Captain Shirk at once with four boats, all I have just now. I think there is no doubt but that we can reopen the Tennessee.

LE ROY FITCH,

Lieutenant-Commander.

NASHVILLE, November 2, 1864-9 a. m.

Major General John M. SCHOFIELD,

Tilton and Resaca:

Mr. Anderson, superintend of transportation, will have cars at Dalton for about 5,000 of your troops to-night. March the balance of your corps to Chattanooga, via Ringgold, by road, where they will take cars for Pulaski, via this place, unless it can be so arranged that they can be picked at Ringgold, which will be done if possible. The very heavy text on the transportation of the road has necessitated this, and has otherwise materially interfered with my plans.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DALTON, November 2, 1864-3. 25 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Resaca;

Head of column here. I had to leave some ammunition and a few sick at Tilton, and will have to send a car or two down for them when our train comes, unless they can be taken upon some up train. Can you tell how many cars will come for my command? I should like to arrange the assignment in advance. I find we could have loaded as easily at Tilton as here.
