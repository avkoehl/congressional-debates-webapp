Colonel HALPINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of West Virginia:

COLONEL: The inclosed dispatch has just been received from General Averell. All is quiet here. Scouts from Smithfield report a small squad of rebel cavalry at that place. The railroad bridge over the Opequon is finished, and a party will be sent from here to-morrow to repair the road half way. Cannot a cavalry scout be sent from Harper's Ferry to meet it and charge of this place. The Thirty-fourth Ohio will be sent to him early in the morning.

Respectfully,

WILL RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: Drove the enemy to-day from Darkesville to Bunker Hill, and beat him at the latter place, where he made a strong stand. All silent on my left. Can hear nothing from Crook or Hayes. Should like to be informed if you know anything of them. From the enemy's resistance here it is indicated that he feels safe on his right flank or eastward.

Respectfully,

Jackson has attempted two stands, but broken in both. My advance is within five miles of Winchester. Jackson has used some artillery. My casualties are not over a dozen killed and wounded; can't hear anything of Crook. If you should obtain any information of him send it forward promptly.

WM. W. AVERELL.
