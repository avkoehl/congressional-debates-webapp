Major-General DIX, Commanding Department of Virginia:

GENERAL: Of the various reports that I have received of the enemy to-day, that made by Major Hall I regard as entirely to be relied on. He saw a full-sized regiment of infantry moving across beyond Quall's house, from the road to Baltimore Cross-Roads toward the road to Long Bridge. This was about 1 o'clock to-day. At the same time, he saw moving off in the direction of the Cross-Roads about 150 rebel cavalry. It is now nearly two hours since the enemy have disappeared from the view of our outer pickets.
