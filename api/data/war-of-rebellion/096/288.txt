CITY POINT, January 29, 1865.

(Received 1.55 p. m.)

General RUCKER:

The Webster left here for Annapolis at 10 a. m. There are complaint's that the railroad trains are insufficient and horribly slow and irregular. Can you not run a train direct between Washington and Annapolis during this cold weather? Please cause the City Point and other vessels to be liberated from the Potomac as soon as possible. We are nearly out of coal. I had supposed General Thomas would have caused a plenty to be sen there long ago, but now the coal vessels are frozen in on the Delaware. The weather is very windy. At 12 m. to-day thermometer at 38^. Considerable thin ice on the river.
