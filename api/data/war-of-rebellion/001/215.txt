&amp;c., along the breast-height for missiles; twenty-three flights of steps lead to the parapet; ammunition in limber-boxes is placed convenient for instant use, and grape, canister, shot, and shell in abundance at each gun. Some five hundred cartridge bags have been made. The powder is well stored in the first-story magazine in the left gorge angle.

Second tier.-The 32-pounder on the right flank is dismounted; the forty-one 8-foot square openings are securely closed by a 3-foot brick wall, laid in cement, and backed in twenty-seven by two feet of sand, kept in place by a sheathing of boards or by barrels, in eight by two feet of flagging-stones, laid dry, and in six by dry brick, or re-enforced only by piles of finishing-stuff and flooring-boards.

First tier.-The armament consists of twenty-seven guns, and is fully described in the plan adjoined.* There are eighteen guns ready for instant service, sixteen of the embrasures in front of which are closed with the original 6-inch wooden shutter, and also with an inner 6-inch shutter fitting close to the throat, and through the center of which a link from the outer shutter passes; and iron key tightens both firmly together. Two are closed by iron shutters of 1/2-inch iron plate; all are further secured by a 10-foot brace abutting against the gun run "from battery." Where guns are mounted (9), but not required for immediate use, the embrasures (9) are closed temporarily, in addition to the outer shutter, by stone flagging, notched to fit the throat and laid flat, or by brick laid in mortar. There are fourteen embrasures, behind which guns are not mounted, of which eight, on the flanks, are closed by an 18-inch brick wall laid in mortar against the outer shutter; one by the dry-stone flagging, and the remainder (five) on the right face, by an entire embrasure filling of brick and stone laid in mortar.

The doors of the two posterns on the flanks are strengthened by 3-foot brick walls laid in mortar against the outer doors.

On the parade four 8-inch and one 10-inch columbiads are mounted as mortars (see preceding plan), and point to Morris Island and Charleston. All the temporary buildings and the lumber have been removed for fuel, the flagging turned on edge against the quarters or in the ends of the casemates, the shell spread on the walks, the sand and brick used, with a stone revetment, for splinter-proof traverses about the guns and in front of the hospital. The lantern has been removed from the light-house and placed on a platform in the center. The entire parade is clear.

Main postern.-A stone and brick wall laid in cement is built against the outer gate to within four feet of the lintel. It is three feet six inches thick and six feet high. Through it is a manhole one foot eleven inches wide. An 8-inch sea-coast howitzer on a caseate-top carriage only looks through the manhole. In the door above the wall are four loop-holes, reached by steps. One leaf of the gate is firmly bolted shut; the other can be opened or securely shut, and through it and corresponding with the manhole in the wall is a manhole closed by a door. The outside of the gate and inside of the small door are covered with 1/2-inch iron. The inner doer is fastened with a wooden cross-bar, and has a manhole closed by a door; there are four loopholes in it, and two
