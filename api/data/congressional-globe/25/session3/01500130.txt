if the question weie pieseiited at once, he should
vote against it He knew not what change might
be wrought upon his mind by a full and fair dis-
cussion, but as yet he had seen no reason to
change his opinion, though he had read all that
had been written and published on this subject
by the Abolitionists themselves Mi A then
