Mr. TAPPAN said, when Senators on the other
side declare that tins Batik b 11 is intended to wiih-
hold from the cofpo ation cie«ted by it the power
of making loans and jir-count=, he felt himself
bound to beheve thirísuch wgs their honest con-
struction of it. He wa=, however, surprised that
any man, m the slightest degree acquainted with
the banking business of the country, who h-d read
this bill, should suppose 'hat, under its provision*,
the company mi irporated by it would not have
unlimited power to loan their paper and to dis-
count the paper of the r "customers. The nsnih
fundamental ar1 cle say?, that " the said cor
poration shall not, direc ly or indirectly, deal
or trade in any thing except foreign bills of ex-
change, including bills or drafts drawn m one State
or Territory and payable in another " This bill, in
this last claase, sai etioned a mode of discountirg
paper, and making loans, common m the West-
ern country. He spok  of a mode of doing busi-
ness vvhich he had full kno v'eJ e of, and he ask-
ed S'na'or , Lerefo e, to look at it A man who
wants a loan from ab«rk applies *o Uie directors,
and is told, we csn lerdjou ihe money, but we do
not take notes for our loa^s—you must give us a
draft, but, sa\s the appl cant, I have no funis
any where to draw up< n, no matter, "av the bank-
ers, if your draft o not n et, or expected *o be
met, because you have no funds, that need make
no difference, you may pay it he e, with ihe ex-
change, when the time it has to ran is out, so
the borrower signs a draft or but of exchange

Baltimore, and pave the discount tor tb  fme it

bill, he is most lamentably simple.

The bill was then read a third time by its tule,
and finally pa sed.
The question being next on the title of the biM,
Mr. TAPPAN moved that it be changed to the
style and tide oi "The United States Bank " He
contended that it was inconsistent wnh the boasted
chi/alry of the Senator from Kentucky to <anc
tion any subterfuge, or shrink from calling things
by their right nam's This was nothing but a
Um'ed States Bank, and it ought lo De cal'ed by
in ie«! name, and not by one which was not ap-

be concurred m— he effect would be to give up
the measure entirely, and allow the whole affair
