HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-9 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I understand the concluding paragraph of your directions to assault the work near the Crow house to mean that the portion of my command on the right of the Boydton plank road will be thrown forward in the direction of that road, and that the position on the left will be made to conform to the movement of the other part, and the new conditions. I inclose a copy of my direction to General Hays.*

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 1, 1865-9 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Sheridan has had a severe fight with the enemy west of Dinwiddie Court-House; cavalry and Fifth Corps engaged. Sheridan has completely routed the enemy, capturing several batteries, over 4,000 prisoners, and numerous trains. To prevent re-enforcements being sent to the forces operating against Sheridan it is necessary you should feel for a chance to get through the enemy's lines at once, and if you can get through push on to-night. Let your batteries be opened without waiting for the time to form assaulting columns; attack without delay. Sheridan is still pushing the enemy.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

[Same to Generals Wright and Parke, and copy to General Grant.]
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-9.15 p.m. [Received 9.45 p.m.]

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Your telegram received. The order to assault at once applies to the Crow house work as well as all other points I suppose. I shall order accordingly. Please let me know if I am right in this?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
