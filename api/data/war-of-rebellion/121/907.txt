Referred to the Adjutant-General to direct the report to be made.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., May 9, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward report of Surgeon Cooper concerning the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis. The sentinels are in the same position now that they have been for the past six months--that is, since Colonel Pelouze inspected the rooms. The floor is covered with matting between two and three inches thick. I will, if thought advisable, relieve the sentinel between Davis' room and the one occupied by the officer of the guard.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

[Inclosure.]

FORT MONROE, VA., May 9, 1866.

Major General NELSON A. MILES,

Commanding District of Fort Monroe:

SIR: The apparent health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis is not as good as at last report. He seems to be weaker after exercise than heretofore. I observe that his walk is growing less steady. He complains constantly of want of sleep, which he represents as being broken by the tramps of the sentinels and the noise made in their being relieved. He is nervous and very excitable, the passing of the sentinel by the doors and windows seeming to affect him. He is well fed but eats little.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, May 9, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES, Commanding, &amp;c., Fort Monroe, Va.:

The President directs that Surgeon Cooper submit an early report respecting the health of Jefferson Davis. Let the report be addressed to the Adjutant-General. Acknowledge receipt.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., May 10, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report state prisoner J. Davis appears to be about the same as for the past few days. He takes three hours' exercise about the ramparts besides what he takes in his room. Since his wife has been here he seems to be in better spirits.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General of Volunteers.
