Great commotion among rebels. Clouds of dust rising. Citizens and prisoners report Polk's corps near Hill's at Tyner's Station,and say Bragg will go to Kentucky will Kingston.

Brig. General J. W. RIPLEY,

Washington, D. C.:

I forward by mail an interesting statement of facts showing that the exposure of our saddles to rain causes rapid wear. The return of convalescent soldiers,recruits,and conscripts,and the enlistments in the Tennesse regiments,will make it necessary to have 2,000 more horse equipments as soon as they can be sent,and these to be followed by 2,000 more in a short time. An extra supply of these should always be on hand,as we lose the services of a man and horse every day a trooper is dismounted for want of a saddle. Please make provision.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Colonel Simmons,

Chief Commissary, Nashville:

Why is it impossible to send stores to Tracy City?It would save a long distance to Wood's division to draw supplies from that point. Answer.

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, August 22, 1863.

GENERAL ROSECRANS:

I would respectfully say the reason why pontoons have not been delivered sooner is because the cars have not been unloaded.
