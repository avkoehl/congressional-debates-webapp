DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, June 24, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: This Department has received a communication, bearing date the 11th instant, from Major-General Butler, at New Orleans, setting forth his proceedings with reference to the Mexican Consulate in that city. I will thank you to inform that officer that those proceedings are entirely approved, and are considered to be characterized by sagacity, firmness, and decision.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, June 24, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I notice that Major-General Butler is represented to have required certain oaths from foreigners at new Orleans. Though his general right, pursuant to martial law, to make any exactions which he may deem necessary for the peace and safety of the district under his command cannot be questioned, the expediency of requiring oaths from those who do not owe a permanent allegiance to the Government is so doubtful that I am directed by the President to request you to order him to discontinue that practice for the future, and to cancel any such obligations which may thus have been compulsorily contracted. Foreigners owe temporary allegiance to the authorities wherever they may reside. From this nothing but a treaty stipulation can absolve them. In general, however, it is best to presume that they will observe this allegiance. If, however, they disregard it, the particular acts by which this disregard may be shown are liable to punishment by the civil or, if this should be silent or inadequate, by martial law. It is preferable, for the maintenance of harmonious relations with foreign power, that misconduct on the part of their citizens or subjects within our jurisdiction should not be anticipated, but that its actual development should be awaited. When it shall have occurred, is notorious in particular instances, or shall be susceptible of due proof, their Government can not reasonably complain if the guilty parties are punished in proportion to their offense. This Department having been officially apprised by the British Legation here that Mr. Coppell had been duly appointed acting British consul at New Orleans, I will again thank you to direct General Butler to respect his official acts accordingly. It is to be regretted that the general should have deemed it advisable to issue a certain order in consequence of which that gentleman deemed it necessary formally to relinquish his consular functions. He has been requested through the British Legation here to resume them.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

WN, VA., June 24, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General of the Army, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Personal matters of much importance to myself requiring my immediate return to Europe, I have the honor to tender the resignation
