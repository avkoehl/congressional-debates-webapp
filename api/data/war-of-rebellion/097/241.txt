destructive raids on the railroad into Maryland. A party of citizens of Loudoun propose to capture the party, if armed by the Government, and ask that they shall have such reward for the service as will enable them temporarily to live elsewhere, which they will be compelled to do if they are successful. I think the result would justify the experiment.

J. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, March 28, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

Some guerrillas, form thirty to fifty number, have been reported. They attacked a wood party at Mrs. Baylor's between Summit Point and Charleston, I believe, but were driven off, with few of our men wounded. They also robbed some citizens on the road about three miles from Stephenson's. When last heard from the attack of the wood party they were going toward Smithfield. Please notify General Brooke and General Egan.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Richmond papers of to-day have been received. The Dispatch says:

There was a flying rumor yesterday that the Yankees had made a flying move toward the South Side Railroad, but we think this was only a guess, founded on the knowledge that Sheridan has joined Grant.

We have no news here. All eyes are eagerly bent to the James River and Petersburg. I hope the present fine weather will afford you relaxation, exercise, and improved health. I am not aware of anything requiring your attention here, and feel that your presence with the army will be gratifying to officers and soldiers, while relieving you from torment. I beg to present my compliments to Mrs. Lincoln.
