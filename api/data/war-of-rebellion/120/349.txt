Question. Have you any knowledge of officers or soldiers of the Federal Army belonging to the Northern section of the order?

Answer. I do not know. I never had any talk with but one. I met with one officer, but I have heard Forrest say there were quite a number of them. I was telling Forrest that I had captured a lieutenant who belonged to this order, and that I immediately turned him loose. Forrest said that was exactly right; that he had captured many of them and turned them loose--most of them were officers, but one or two were private soldiers.

Question. Did he give a reason why it was right--what the object was?

Answer. Well, no; he did not. He knew I knew that.

Q. Was not one reason because you thought he could be of more service?

Answer. Certainly. I knew he could do us more service in the Federal Army, and I knew he would do us no harm. I could not have captured him or any of his men that day if he had not led them right in.
