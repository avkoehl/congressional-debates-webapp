would sustain the creoit of Government. He had eieat doubt
whether the Government would be able to get a loan on ihe
terms proposed by ihe bill a& it now stands He thought
there weie causes that would affect the credit of ihe Govern-
ment which could 01 )y be removed by providing ample
means foi the sccuiity of this loan He suppo&ed, as the
