Major EDWIN A. RIGG,

First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding Camp Wright:

MAJOR: Your note of November 6, instant, I received last evening. As soon as Colonel Andrews' command arrives from Yuma give the colonel all your wagons and your ambulance, if necessary, to move his command from Camp Wright to San Diego. Not one of Mr. Banning's wagons can be used for this purpose, as they must come on without delay to San Pedro. You will load Mr. Banning's train with the stores and property of Camp Wright and move that camp to Oak Grove, or to Tmeecula, if in your judgment, after having surveyed the country, the latter would be considered the best point, and direct your train to return with supplies from San Diego to the new camp, whch, by the by, will retain its present name. Colonel Wright decided before he left Los Angles that Mr. Banning's train must not go to San Diego, so use it to move your camp, provided you do not delay it. Have everything packed against it comes up.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Colonel First California Volunteers, Commanding.

SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., November 9, 1861.

Lieutenant-Colonel BLAKE:

(Care of N. L. Perkins, Folsom, Cal.)
