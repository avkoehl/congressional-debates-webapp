Ambrose Spencer, who professes to be well informed in regard to the criminal conduct alleged against Winder, has given distinct assurances from time to time that he would furnish such details in regard to this man's offenses, with names of witnesses, &amp;c., as would enable the Government to put him on trial, but as yet he has not done so.
