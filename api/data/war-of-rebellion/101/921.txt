Honorable A. LINCOLN:

Your dispatch asking about General Fisk met me here, where I had come to meet General Curtis. I returned to Saint Louis to-morrow, and will endeavor to answer your inquiry. I have not been long enough in command to find out fully about men and their proceedings, but shall find out soon.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I request authority to build telegraph line from Lawrence to Fort Riley. The Indian troubles on south route and the roubles to be apprehended in Southwest Kansas render it necessary that we should have quick communication with the Fort Riley depot, where we concentrate troops, to operate in both of these directions. As it now stands it takes five days to communicate and get answer.

Two regiments from Rock Island begin to leave for Leavenworth to-day by companies; two companies leave to-day. Instruct commanding officer at Leavenworth to arm and dispose of them. Will leave for Saint Louis to-morrow; wish to see you there.
