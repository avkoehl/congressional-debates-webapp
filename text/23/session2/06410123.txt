on the law of the land, and did not requae the
investigation of a committee
Mr MIINER saw no necessity of sending this
item to a committee for further investigation     it
had been adowed by the proper accounting offi-
cers, and teemod to bea proper subject for appro
pnation      He should vote for the amendment
Mr WARD WELL asked why, when G nerala
Scott and Ripley received this extra pay—as it
had been alleged they did—why did not General
Macomb also recei\e his at the barre time, and in
the «ame manner
Mi POLK again exolamed Hehad fhismorn-
ing inquired into the reason why this claim had
not been passed upon ui an earlier period He
did not know that General Macomb was, at the
time, avaie of his own right upon the subject
It was well known, how adverse peisons con-
nected with tie Department weie to revive the
ads of their predecessors, hence the subject had
been tu ned ovei to the action of Congress He
again adverted to the favorable decision made
U| on the claim by the officeis of the Government,
wmch appealed perfectly conclusive The only
question he ar p-ehe ded was as to the time and
place of in km  the appropriation
Mi MAN'S sail u had been a sumed that the
duties had been neiformej, which would sanction
this claim, unde-- the act of 1*18 This, he con-
tended, rema ned yet to be proven, and it wasfor
this %eiy reason he wished me whole mattertogo
thiough the ^eaiching investigation of one of the
s audmg committees of the House He thought
It very i markuble that General Macomb should
have sufered this claim of $G,080 05 to stand so
long ui I out making a demand on the Go eri
nent He had endeavored in vain to ascertain
the amount of that officer's present pay under the
Government What that amount was he could
not t-'l, nor could he find any gentleman who
could tell
Mi ERÍGGS thought the only question before
the House to- be, " Is, or was, Geneial Macomb
snti led to the surn specified bv the laws of the
land ' If so, the appropriation was certainly a
proper one, ai d the amendment ougnt to be
adop'ed Mr B said he had carefully examined
the aubject,and could not lesist the conclusion that
this s.us a valid claim He referíed to the specific
terms of the law of 1813, which clearly fixed the
prim. pl° of allowing the pay corresponding to the
brevet rank The gentleman from New Yoik
[Mr MímííJ had refeired to the piesentpayof
the officers, and sta ed that he could notascertam
..s amount Mr B said ihis, with him, was not
tne qaen on. It was, whethei an officer should
be peiu for specific duties peiformed, the pucesof
«n ch wete fixed and sanctioned by law He
should vo e f< r ti e amendment
M P-VRh-CR. optosed the amendment It
wi  due to the Hous" tha the claim s lould go to
a st indmgeoiimittee *oi examination He looked
upon it in the light ot any o hei pi na'e claim, and
t¡ e apptopmtion bill was not the proper place to
se He a pnvate claim of 'ouiteen yeais' s'andmg
He d -. i\ iwed all pieju Jice agai st 'he ciaim, but
i e wished to see it come leie in the snaoe and en
the giound c-f allothers He would the-efoievote
apir ist the amendment

< liim— he insertion of ibis item m the a ipropri-
a i in bill might estaulisn a meeedent of the most-
tiingtious character
Messrs BRIGG3 and HUBBARD each made
a few additional remarks
Mr POLK wished the amendment read by the
clerk, in orüer that the House might see what they
were about
The amendment having been read—
Mr P said he had called for its reading foi the
simple purpose of showing to the House that it
was of the same character as all former items in
app opriation bills providing for arrearages, and
also to meet the objection of gentlemen who thought
this bill an improper place for it The item was
foi no hing more than arrearages of pay in the
. Army, wn ch nail been called for by the Secretaiy
| of War, and presented itself in this chaiacter it
l came within the line of duty of the Committee of
Ways and Means to intioduce it to the attention
I of the Hou-.e Mr P read the letter of the Sec
íe ary of War, which set forth that! e considered
this claim in the light of a subsisting and standing
debt, a-nd requested the committee to insert it in
the bill Mr P hqped, after thi=, that every gen
t'eman would dismiss from his mird the consid
eiation that if thib claim were well founded the bill
befoie them was not tne prooer piace for it
I Another objection that had been urged was, that
the amendment was pressed with too much perti-
nacity But it was not so, so far as Mr P wa«
concerned He had never been desuous that the
House should act precipitately on any matter,
however his own judgment might be at vauance
with the opposition to it On the present subject
he had no private opinion, or bias whatever, and
had only presented it as a natter of duty Phis
was a claim presented to tne House, which had
received the favorable adjudication of the Second
Coffptiollei, the Secietaiy of tne Treasury, and
the Secretary of War and the question was how
it should be paid Mi P also re id tne opinion
of the Attorney Geneiil in favor of the Droposed
mode of liquidating tne claim Mr P did not
deny but that the House might withhold theanf 10
' pnajon, because it might decide that the uííicers
retened to had bten wioi g 11 their constiuction
of (he la\ , but he had done ills du'y m present
ins u for tl eir convídela ion
Mr WHITTLESEY, of Onn, retried at some
length to the foi mi r | roceet ings on thi« claim,
anl saul, that a'though the decision of the Mill
tary Commi tee had changed it-- character, ye', in
his opinion, it ought to undergo the further exam-
ination of a standing committee, and he shou'd
therefore, atiie&ent, vote agamst the amendment
Mr MANrv, of New York, called for the yeas
and nays, which were ordeied
Mr CAMBRELENG asked if he understood
the honoiable chairman of the Committee of Wavs
and Means correctly, that the claim was founded
upon a law, and that he had read that law to the
Hou«e'
Mr  POLK renlied in the affirmative
M. CAMBRELENG Then I snail voce in
favor of the amendiner t
