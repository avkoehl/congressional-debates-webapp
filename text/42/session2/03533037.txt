THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

My friend from Illinois [Mr. Borchard]
has well earned the eulogy of an honest man
by following this true formula of discussion.
But even he falls below the mark. If he
had stated the full result it would be so in-
credible that men would cease to wonder
that even demagogues proclaim the mystery
of this tariff inquity. I reproduce, however,
one of bis significant tables, which shows,
per capita, the bounty which a certain class
of manufactures receive,
ducing it:
He says, in intro-
The statistical tables of importations and of do-
mestic production in this country give the total con-
sumption, the census statistics the number of persons
employed, and the tariff laws the rate of duty by
•which the price of the domestic article is sought to
be enhanced above the foreign. I append a table
giving the bounty allowed by present laws to manu-
, facturers engaged in producing some of the most
I necessary articles of comfort, health, and enjoy-
' ment:

* Census of 1860.
If this table should include all the protected
classes it would not be out of the way to say
that at least $500,000,000 per annum have
been taken from the body of the people for
purposes other than revenue, so that since
1861, during ten years, there has been
five billions taken from the national wealth;
twice our national debt! We have to show for
it—what? Why, increased, unhealthy labor
in some departments of industry; copper, iron,
coal, woolens, &c. Truly. But this great trib-
ute has obliterated commerce; it has preyed
upon the masses of mechanics ; it has been a
mildew to the farmers; it is an unhealthy blight
upon the general prosperity. Our export trade
shows it. Our total domestic exports in-
creased twelve and a half per cent, between
1860 and 1870; our exports of leading do-
mestic manufactures declined from $34,500,000
to $12,800,000—a decrease of sixty-two and a
half per cent. ; in other words, under the
protective system we have lost about two
thirds of our export trade in manufactures.
This enormous and ruinous tribute is given
without consideration. It is bounty. Our
values of all kinds are estimated by authority
at $30,000,000,000. By this peculiar system
there would have been $5,000,000,000 fairly
distributed among the body of the people who
earned it; and it, would have gone into the
homes of hundreds of thousands of families,
to bless and comfort them, instead of increas-
ing the huge mountainous wealth which but a
few are piling up. and which are the standing
dangers to liberty in this country.
LABOK AND WAGES IN EUKOFE.
The one great argument relied on by pro-
tectionists is the "pauper-labor" fallacy. In
the same connection it has been attempted to
show that the tariff is a great blessing to the
laboring man. The wages of labor in Belgium,
Prussia, and other countries of lijurope are
cited to show that wages are lower there than
in this country. England may not answer the
purposes of high-tariff sophists, as there the
wages approximate the rates of this country.
The great,and patent causes which have brought
about the poverty and degradation of the labor-
ing man in these countries are omitted, as well
as the causes which prevent or retard the same
results in this country. It is the operation of
the political or governmental systems which
have impoverished the laboring men of Euro-
pean countries. They are the large standing
armies, the large civil lists, the religious es-
tablishments, the national debts, &c. These
have helped to bring about the degradation
and oppression of the laboring men of Europe.
These have been the excuses for the heavy
taxation which has oppressed the labor of
Europe for ages. The barons of the Middle
tTons.
Ages robbed them by force of arms, modern
Governments rob them by taxation. Another
great cause operates: the supply of labor in
those countries is in excess of the demand for
it. This, added to the causes already men-
tioned, accounts for the low rates of wages in
Europe.
In this country the same causes are now
operating with great energy to produce the
same results. We have a costly Army and
Navy, a large civil list, a large national debt,
and, what is worse than all, the infamous tariff
system, which robs the people to pay bounties
to manufacturing monopolists.
These causes, when added to a dense popu-
lation, and when the supply of labor will be in
excess of the demand, will produce the same
poverty and degradation of the laboring man
here. But the catastrophe is here retarded by
scarcity of labor in proportion to the demand.
This state of things is but temporary. It is
also retarded by the fact thatthe laboring man
if too much oppressed here can escape from
the oppression of capital by fleeing to the pub-
lic domain and cultivating the land. This he
can get by settling upon it, or at a low price.
When that great safety-valve for labor is gone—
and under our peculiar legislation it is fast
going—and our population becomes dense,
and labor plenty, as it must then be, we shall
see here precisely the same state of things
which exists in Europe.
The monopolists understand this. Hence
they look forward to a strong Government with
its armed forces between them and the impov-
erished, desperate, and anarchial proUtaire.
Hence the facile acquiescence in military usur-
pations and the suspension of habeas corpus.
But where the free-trade system prevails,
the wages of labor have increased consider-
ably, while the hours of labor have dimin-
ished, and the general condition of the labor-
ing classes has improved. In certain other
European countries where there are protec-
tive tariffs, wages are low, and the masses are
not improved or improving.
I refer to England, or more particulary to
the Clyde, lo illustrate the fact that free-trade
policies enhance wages; and by a comparison
with this country I will show that it is our ruin-
ous protective system which impoverishes the
workingman. This will not appear by a mere
statement of the rates of wages, but by the fur-
ther statement of how much the wages will buy,
and especially what they will buy which is ne-
cessary to a laboring man's family. So that
under our protective system the laboring man
here in reality may have nominally greater
wages than in England, but really he works
more hours to purchase the same necessaries.
This invaluable table is answer quite enough
to all the brood of falsities promulgated by
hired writers and selfish leagues:
