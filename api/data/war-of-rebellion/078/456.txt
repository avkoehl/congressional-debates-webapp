DECATUR JUNCTION, September 24, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

We have all sorts of rumors from Athens. The forces certainly large. It is reported that they have burned the depot at Athens. I shall move there with all the forces I can collect.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 24, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

From the best information that I can obtain, the force in and about Athens belongs to Forrest's command. Colonel Prosser, who returned this morning, reports them constantly increasing. He made 8 prisoners, some of them belonging to the Second (rebel) Tennessee. they crossed at Florence, and represent that they are commanded by Forrest in person. One of the block-houses was summoned to surrender by General Forrest. The force is unquestionably a large one. The prisoners state that Forrest told them at Okolona that they would have force enough to destroy both railroads and stay in Tennessee as long as he pleased. Colonel Prosser is satisfied that General Forrest is with them in person. I have heard nothing from the THIRD Tennessee, which I ordered down to Elk River, or from Colonel Spalding, who left for Shoal Creek day before yesterday. I shall move at once with all the forces at my command, in anticipation of return of the enemy. I retained One hundred and second Ohio and Seventy-THIRD Indiana.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 24, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

Colonel Campbell, Athens, was said to have surrendered the post at that place, the strongest position in the district. Forrest was there at 2 o'clock this afternoon; firing was heard there then. Forrest's force said to be very large. No one seems to be able to approximate his numbers. I don't believe, however, it is even 4,000. The detachment sent from here to re-enforce Athens last night, about 350, is said to have been captured within one mile and a half of Athens, after a very obstinate engagement. Starkweather promised to be at Athens yesterday afternoon, but nothing has been heard of him since.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have conversed with as escaped prisoner Ninth Indiana, who appears to be a shrewd, intellectual man. He left Wheeler this morning at Courtland. He says Forrest crossed at Bainbridge and Florence day before yesterday; that his force, with Roddey's, will not exceed 4,000. Wheeler's force has gone south with orders to join Hood in Georgia.
