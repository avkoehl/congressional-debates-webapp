Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Fort Lincoln:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you take measures, if not already done, to guard securely the tete-de-pont Benning's Bridge. The navy people were to be sent you by detachments or companies as soon as armed. With the two regiments sent by General McCook it is supposed that your force will be ample, as it is well known that you have only cavalry and artillery in your front.

Very respectfully, general, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Mrs. McDaniel's, Fort Lincoln, July 12, 1864.

Your order directing me to take measures to defend Benning's Bridge is attended to at once by sending a portion of the force now arriving to it, providing it can be found in the dark.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
