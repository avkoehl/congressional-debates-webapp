General Vandever reports Clanton has passed the Coosa on his way north. He will come up doubtless by way of La Fayette in concert with Wheeler. Be on your guard and prevent a junction if possible. Call for cavalry and infantry from above.

ROME, August 20, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

The rebel General Clanton crossed the Coosa at Gadsden on Tuesday lat with 1,200 cavalry, and proceeded north to strike the railroad, either between Bridgeport and Chattanooga or between Stevenson and Huntsville. My cavalry is after him. I had a courier killed last night bringing this intelligence.

WM. VANDEVER,

Brigadier-General.

CHATTANOOGA, August 20, 1864.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Nashville:

General Vandever telegraphs from Rome that General Clanton crossed the Coosa at Gadsden Tuesday with 1,200 men (cavalry), and proceeded north to strike the railroad between this point and Huntsville. Reports from Charleston, Tenn., say that a portion of Wheeler's raiders have gone to Cotton Port, on Tennessee River, but from most reliable information I get I think most of his forces have taken the direction of Knoxville.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

CHATTANOOGA, August 20, 1864.
