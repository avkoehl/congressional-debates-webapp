Brigadier General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Third Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you place two divisions of your corps in bivouac to-night, at the foot of the two bridges over which Major-General Franklin passed his command. These two divisions will be instructed to cross those bridges, if it should become necessary to defend them. Whipple's division will bivouac between the Lacy house and river, to guard the ford. The general desires to receive a copy of your orders making these dispositions.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GENERAL: Designate to me the regiment you consider the best marching and fighting regiment (or one of the best) in your command-one to be designated for the duty of accompanying a light battery and forming portions of a light brigade, to march in advance and ascertain the force and position of the enemy. This brigade will be made up of regiments selected from Stoneman's and the Fifth Corps. General Hooker wishes an excellent commander and a good marching regiment. Please reply by bearer.

Yours, respectfully,

GENERAL: General Butterfield directs me to say that General Whipple's command is now crossing; that, owing to the town being full of troops and no room, you will not cross until further orders. General Whipple goes over to relieve Hancock's outposts, guards, &c.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
