Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION,TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

In Camp near Well's House, In the Field, Va., April 3, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General THEODORE READ,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have received the order to march at 4 o'clock, having already encamped at the Wells house, nine miles from Petersburg, and had issued the order to march so as to close up the gap. My trains have been much interrupted by those of the Second Corps, but they are closed up on my column. One of my regiments, the Eighth, has staid behind, having probably been stopped by some staff officer and sent back to Petersburg, under the impression that the order to take another direction had not been revoked. The Eighth is expected up to-night. I need about twelve fresh horses for my battery.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

WM. BIRNEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
