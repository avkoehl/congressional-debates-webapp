made and the tenacity with which the position was held is deserving of high commendation, the attempts of the enemy to dislodge us being signally repulsed. He was ably supported by Buschbeck, a portion of whose troops, under Colonel Taft, drove the enemy from the Glass' houses and followed them to the summit of Tunnel Hill, where they maintained a gallant and prolonged combat, with the loss of their gallant commander. The brigades of Matthies and Raum, John E. Smith's division, re-enforced Loomis and Buschbeck and participated in the action with gallantry, Cockerill in reserve occupying the intrenchments and supporting the batteries. Four Rodman, of Davis' division, re-enforced us on the slope with fine effect. The enemy retreated in the night, and at daybreak of the 26th, at the head of the corps, we crossed the Chickamauga in pursuit, sending our prisoners to the rear without account.

Our loss was as follows:
