RIVER ROAD, ABOUT TWO MILES WEST OF

JUNCTION OF COX'S AND RIVER ROADS,

April 3, 1865-2.05 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel A. C. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

COLONEL: Major Bingham was mistaken in stating that the Second Division was coming on the River road. I took the River road, left the request with General Wright, which he granted, and pushed on, meeting at the end of the Sixth Corps, at this point, Colonel Woodall, First Delaware, who had come from Petersburg expecting to find Second Division on this road. I am now going to cut across into Cox's road, and send this back for your information, allowing General Wright to see it for his.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

CLIFFORD STICKNEY,

First Lieutenant, Signal Corps.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 3, 1865.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Sheridan desires that you mass your corps at or near Williamson's house (where his headquarters were last night) and await further orders. A. P. Hill's corps seems to be completely demoralized, and we are picking up numbers of his troops. His men report that he was killed at Petersburg yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. A. FORSYTH,

Brevet Colonel and Acting Aide-de-Camp.

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

April 3, 1865-3.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of this date, which is just received, I am directed by Major-General Sheridan to say that he has been informed by General Grant that the Army of the Potomac is moving in this direction upon the north side of the Appomattox, and the troops of the Army of the James by Cox's road. The general presumes that the trains of the army will be moved in conformity with the march of the troops, and therefore desires that you will follow the Fifth Corps with all possible dispatch.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. C. NEWHALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
