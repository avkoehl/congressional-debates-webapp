*Note on original return, probably indorsed in Adjutant and Inspector General's Office at Richmond, states that it is the first return of this command received from Lieutenant-General Polk. On December 16, 1863, General Johnston was directed by President Davis to turn over the immediate command of the "Army of the Mississippi" to General Polk, &amp;c. In assuming the command thus indicated, Lieutenant-General Polk (December 23, 1863) designated it as the "Department of the Southwest," but that designation was on January 28, 1864, changed by the C. S. War Department to the "Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana."

+Actual brigade commanders not indicated on original return. The assignment of batteries is given as specially reported January 15. It is not indicated on original.

++Dismounted.
