movement of Green's division. The commanding general thinks that from the character of the boats which have come up the Ouachita, we may be able to drive them back; but even if we do not, the falling of the water will probably prevent their remaining. He hopes the defenses and obstructions at Fort De Russy will be in good condition should the enemy advance up Red River. He thinks there will be no movement in very large force upon this department till the Mobile campaign is decided.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. CUNNINGHAM,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

Major-General MAGRUGER,

Houston:

GENERAL: You will order General Greens' division to move to Alexandria, La., with all possible dispatch and report to Major-General Taylor. The old military road is considered the best line of march if supplies can be procured on that route. If not, the best line will be through Hardin, Jasper, and Newton Counties, Tex., supplies of corn and rations having been ordered at Jasper, Tex., and Huddleston, La. No notice has been received that these supplies have been accumulated. An officer should be sent forward to ascertain. Acknowledge receipt.

By order of Lieutenant General E. Kirby Smith:
