1865.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
183
They belonged only to Great Britain. When
they threw off dependence to the mother coun-
try they were free and independent to all intents
and purposes, and were so recognized by the world.
They formed a Confederacy of States, and that
not working well thcy^oncluded to establish this
Union. What followed? I need not go to the
debates of the Convention to show that this is a
Union of independent States. The Constitution
itself said that whenever it was ratified by nine
out of the thirteen States it should be binding,
not upon the thirteen, but only upon the nine.
There was no power to be exercised, nor could
there be, for forcing the reluctant States into the
Union. This is not a consolidated Government,
but a confederation of independent States. The
Constitution of the United States is the bond of
the Union. It is the contract by which the States
agreed to form a Government for themselves. It
is a limited Government. The Constitution de-
clares that the powers not vested in this Govern-
ment are reserved to the States and to the people.
We have, therefore, none but delegated powers,
and when we undertake to go beyond them our
acts are null and void. You have 110 more right
to change the fundamental law in reference to
slavery, being one of the reserved lights of the
States, than you have in reference to anything
else, and if you do it you do it by force and
foice alone.
Now, Mr. Speaker, why did this House repeal
the fugitive slave law? Had it a beating upon
atly other State than Kentucky ? Certainly not.
Had not Kentucky stood the fast friend of the
Union? Was she not loyal and entitled to pro-
tection, and does not the Constitution declare that
slaves fleeing from one State to another must be
delivered up? That is the substance as well as
the language of the Constitutionâ€”that the fugi-
tives from labor Khali be delivered up to their
owners. Have you then dealt fairly with Ken-
tucky? Whystab oneof yoursistorloyal States?
You know it was a stab at one of your own loyal
States.
And why this great anxiety to overpower Ken-
tucky ? Mr. Speaker, this idea of restoiing the
Union lias gotten out of your head. It has gone.
You have departed from all the principles laid
down by which you could conduct this thing
properly; and now your acts would indicate that
plunderand robbery were your mam object. You
are confiscating the negroes, as you call it. A
militaiy necessity, you say. You are leaving the
farmers without any help whatever; and you are
putting not all of them into the armies of the
United States, but only a few of them. You have
the remainder of them limning about the country,
pay ing them high wages, and making the people
of the United States clothe and feed them.
And then you are taking others and what are
you doing with them ? You are lunning them off
into the various other States, there to make ser-
vants of them just as they were from whence you
took them. And such as nobody will have you
are taking them away into camps, because they aie
not fit for servants, in my State is Cam p Robinson,
^ # historic almost, because of its early location. It
is built up almost like our cities, and indeed sur-
passes many of them, and even some of our capi-
tals. It has water-works which supply it with
water by a steam engine from the 1 iver;millions of
dollars have been spent there, and you and I are
taxed for all these things. Men high in position
and receiving large salaries are doing nothing but
superintending these camps. This is the way the
people's money is squandered, and you legislate
upon all these matters as though you had the
right to do it.
All your arguments and all your homilies upon
slavery I have heard. They are nothing but the
distempered imagination of narrow minds, cater-
ingtothepublicopimon ofalowand degraded con-
stituency; nothing else. We ought to give them
as much attention as the advice of a pauper picked
up in the streets of London would receive m re-
gard to the financial affairs of the Barings or the
Rothschilds, who cannot keep a sixpence m his
pocket from morning to night.
You talk about slavery, and say you want to
do us good by taking our slaves away ftom us.
If you would match your armies into your north-
ern cities, where men live in marble palaces, who
make fortunes out of the people, and if you would
seize the contents of their banks and distubute it
among the poor, you would do more good than
you would by letting those nabobs have it who
eat their sumptuous dinners and drink their fine
wines. If you are going to revolutionize society
everywhere and do the greatest good, seize upon
that property and divide it among those who are
poor and needy.
The remarks of my friend from New York,
[Mr. Odell,] which I heard with regret, were a
slab directly at the right to hold property. He
is arraying the small number of slaveholders
against the large number of non-slaveholders, and
would rob the few to please the many.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. ICASSON obtained the floor, but yielded.
