MARYVILLE, February 12, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I arrived here last night and found the report, as I supposed, of our troops having been attacked and having evacuated this place unfounded. The report seems to have been made out of whole cloth, and the only basis of it was an attack yesterday morning upon our cavalry pickets here. Our pickets repulsed them easily. To-day I have talked with several citizens, and they all agree that Longstreet is getting short of forage and that it is not improbable that he may essay a movement down on the Little Tennessee for forage.

It is idle to think that the enemy's cavalry can whip us here. Bentley [Wood?] would like nothing better than to have them attempt it.

Captain E. R. KERSTETTER,

Asst. Adjt. General, 3rd Div., 23rd Corps, Knoxville, Tenn.:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I have had the Sevierville road scouted to-day 6 miles out. No enemy met with. From information gathered by the scouts, and from citizens who have come into our lines, I learn that the enemy fell back yesterday to Therman's Cross-Roads, 12 miles from here.
