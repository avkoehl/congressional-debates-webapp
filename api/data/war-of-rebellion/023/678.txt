Commanding, &amp;c., Chattanooga, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding will leave here to-morrow with such force as he can collect to meet the enemy, who have crossed the mountains with 10,000 men of all arms and twelve pieces of artillery and are moving to attack Cumberland Gap in rear. They are also reported as having crossed the mountains from Virginia, and marching toward the same point. The commanding general desires me to say that you will now be left to your own resources, which you will employ as may be most effective for the defense of Chattanooga. You will push forward the defenses of your post as rapidly as possible and make the best stand in your power. He can give you no aid unless he defeats the enemy in Powell's Valley. He directs that the two Florida regiments when they arrive be organized as a brigade and Colonel Davis assigned to the command.

Very respectfully, you obedient servant,
