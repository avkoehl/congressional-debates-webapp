Colonel Dunn, all under charge of Colonel Peters, over the canal by means of a quickly built bridge and attacked in flanks, at the same time opening my two pieces of artillery vigorously on the enemy. He was driven across the Potomac at once, where he took position behind the railroad embankment, a strong block-house on his right and an iron-clad train of cars, a battery, three guns in each, covered with railroad iron at each end, and four cars iron-lines and musket-proof between the two. The first shot from my artillery drove through the engine-boiler, the second through a port hole, dismounting a gun, and the third dispersed the men behind the railroad embankment. Closing up on the block-house, I demanded a surrender, and Colonel Stough, One hundred and fifty-third Ohio, with 80 men and officers and his regimental colors, surrendered to me. Thence I immediately moved to Springfield, where I camped on the South Branch. Here we rested during the 3rd August.*

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Reports of Brigadier General Benjamin F. Kelley, U. S. Army.+

CUMBERLAND, June 26, 1864-11 a. m.

Dispatch just received that the rebels attacked a picket of 100 men at Wire Bridge and Springfield this a. m., and captured the whole party. The force was a portion of Colonel Thompson's regiment, the Sixth Virginia [Cavalry], which had just arrived. Have not learned yet what the rebel force is, but presume it is McNeill's and harness' cavalry. Colonel Thompson has gone in pursuit.
