Public Lands--Mr. Snath*
Sbn*w%
identof Pennsylvania an actual settler in Missis-
sippi' No Ho must go to the land, and reside
upon it himself, and could not do it by proxy
If the Senate should adopt this amendment,
allowing these lefused lands to be added to adja-
cent farms at the low puce, lands which no indi
vidual would buy at $1 25, two oi three hundred
thousand acres of them might be sold, which
would perhaps never sell if the Senate should re-
fuse to permit them thus to be sold The whole
of this would be for the benefit of the new States,
and also for the benefit of the whole Union, en-
abling the Government to sell lands which other-
wise they could not sell
Mr SMITH, of Indiana, said I understand,
Mr President, that the question now before the
Senate is upon the amendment proposed by the
Committee on Public Lands to the instructions
committed to the committee, and reported back
by them, by which amendment the committee
propose to grant the graduation privilege to per-
sons owning adjacent lands upon which they re-
side, as well as to the actual settler upon the
refuse lands which may be entered hereafter at
the graduated prices. The bill, with the amend-
ments, having assumed its present shape, it ap-
pears to me to be a proper time to say something
upon the entire subject I can onlv promise the
Senate as much brevity as the importance of the
question, and the views I enteitain of the merits
of the different propositions, will allow, and a
long silence will justify Before I take up the sub-
ject, permit me to recur for a single moment to
the history of this bill, it may not be without its
use m the progress of the argument The subject
of the public landb, as referred to in the Presi-
dent's message, was sent at an eaily day to the
Committee on the Public Lands The President
recommended graduation, with a special mode of
ascertaining their value by actual assessments
The committee, however, íeported a bill gradu-
ating the price of the public lands, without any
restriction in favor of actual settlers, and relying
on the efflux of time as the criterion of value
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr Clay] then
moved to recommitthe bill to the committee, with
instructions to limit its operation to actual set-
tlers, or those who mightenterfor settlementand
occupancy, a leading member of the committee
asked a division of the question, and the ques-
tion was first taken on the recommitment of the
bill, which was decided in the affirmative, and
upon the instructions the almost entire vote of
the committee and many of the other professed
friends of graduation were found in the negative,
denying the benefit to the actual settler in pref-
erence to the speculator I must confess, sir,
that vote surprised me, I had heard so much said
in favor of the settler that I did suppose there
would not have been a dissenting voice on the
question, but it seems that I wa3 mistaken After
all the cry about speculators by gentlemen, they
are now willing to play into their hands to the
full extent of the seventy million acres operated
upon by this bill So much for the difference
between professions and practice But, sir, the
whole principle of graduation is opposed by cer-
tain Senators, and reasons, which to their minds
no doubt are satisfactory, have been urged against
it; many of them plausible, and some of them
conclusive against the bill as it was originally
introduced. I propose, Mr President, to pro-
ceed with a brief examination of the objections
to the principle, as well as the reasons and argu-
ments which have been advanced in its favor
For, sir, I do not fully concur with either, it
seems to me the truth lies between
First It is contended that the graduation prin-
ciple unsettles and disturbs the whole land sys-
tem of trie country under which it has prospered,
and the new States have settled beyond our most
sanguine anticipations I admit, sir, that the
long-established principles and measures of the
Government should not be disturbed for slight
causes, nor without matuie consideration lam
aware that the greatest novice that may be elected
to either branch of Congress no sooner takes his
seat here than he feels himself notonly qualified,
but called upon, by his great love of country, to
eitherchange the established laws of the land, or,
what is still more important, the Constitution of
the country    Hence you see, sir, the numerous
resolutions to amend that great charter of our lib-
erties not unfiequently mtioduced by men who
have very indistinct views of oui form of Gov-
ernment I admit all this, sir, but still I hum-
bly conceit e that, when it shall appeal manifest |
that a change in the policy of Government is i e-
quired by the public interest, we ought to act in
accordance with that interest If such were not
the fact, experience, which is said to be the best
and safesi teacher, would be entirely thi own away '
and discarded in our legislation here But, su,
the land system has been repeatedly changed,
modified, or unsettled, if you please, from time
to time, as the public good required From six
hundred and forty acre tracts^ it has been divided
and subdivided, until a purchasei can enter forty
acres, giving the poor man an oppoitunity of pb-
taining a home for the sum of fifty dollars The
price has also been reduced fiom two dollars to
one dollar and twenty-five cents, and the cash
system has been introduced in lieu of the credit
Will any Senator say that these modifications of
the system have not resulted in the public good?
I tiust not, and yet, if the aigument that the land
system should not be disturbed had obtained at
that time, we should have lost the benefit of those
valuable modifications of the system So that I
am inclined to believe that we are not estopped
to íeexamine this subject, and to introduce any
other modifications that the best interests of the
country seem to lequire
Secondly It is contended that this system in-
ures to the benefit of the land speculator I am
willing to confess, sn, that such would have been
the case to some considerable extent had the bill
of the committee become a law without any re-
striction, and I am not prepared to say that the
objection would not have been well taken lo that
bill But I am not able to discover how the bill
with the amendments can possibly benefit spocu- .
lators, on the contiary, it seems to me that they <
are expressly excluded from any benefit under it
by the clause confining it to the actual settler in
limited quantities
Thirdly. It is contended that the length of time
lands may have been in the market is no evidence
of their value, on the other hand, the committee
seem to have supposed that time is conclusive
evidence of that fact     On this point I am sat-
isfied, Mr  President, that the truth lies between
the two positions     That time is not conclusive
evidence of the value of the public lands, I well
know, for, sir, to my knowledge, large distnots
in Indiana that were acquired by the tieatyofSt
Mary's, in 1818, lying on the waters of White
river and the tnbutary streams of the Wabash,
and Miami of the Lake, of first rate lands, have
been entered within the last five years, after they
had been ovei ten years in market, while other
lands greatly inferior in quality had been entered
years before, though they had not been near so
long in maiket, and yet, sir, I would not say that
the length of time lands have been in market is no
evidence of their value, it is, however, scarcely
prima facie and will depend much upon the ques-
tion whether new Government lands in sufficient
quantities to supply the demand, by taking a few
selections from each new congressional township,
are continually held out to the purchasers, or
whether they are confined to the old districts until
a full examination of quality is made     But, sir,
the old adage that " distant fields are green," is
applicable in all its force to the emigrant to the
new States   Emigrants seem to take it for gran ted
that the best lands are the furthest off, that the
promised land is still ahead, and so deeply rooted
is this opinion in the minds of mostof them, that
you can scarcely get one to stop long enough in
the old district to look at the lands, until since
our works of internal improvement have attracted
their notice     Ask them to examine lands in In-
diana, they will tell you that they were going to
the West. Iowa, I believe, at present, is the most
popular point, the further off, however, the better
Purchase a country at the mouth of the Oregon,
on the Pacific, running up the inclined plane to
the Rocky mountains, and open land offices there,
and, my word for it, that country would be all the
rase, few emigrants would stop this side of the
Rocky mountains     Yes, sir, " distant fields are
green" in the eyes of the emigrant, and here let
me add, the great benefit I anticipate from the
graduation as, to stop-a portion^ thus emigration,
in the old land districts of the new States,, to ex-
Uact fiom the i oiling tide a-fewdiops at least for
the refreshing of the old distucts, to ofier a bojanty
or rather an inducement, foi examination and
settlement, to those who may desire to puicha.se
m the old districts at the íeduced prices But,
sir, I wiU not further anticipate the argument on
this pojnt at the present moment,    i
Fourthly. It is said that this bill is calculated
to reduce the price of real estate, by the reduc-
tion of the price of so Jarge a quantity of the
public lands There might be something m this
objection if the reduction was- to all public lands
to all persons, but as it applies only to the refuse
lands, and is. confined to settlers, the objection
loses its force, for each successive improvement
that is made by the settler would add more to the
value of the surrounding lands than the difference
between the pnce at which the public lands are
sold and the proposed graduated price He,nce,
real estate cannot bo affected in price by the op-
eration Immediately connected with tins-ques-
tion is the objection to the amendment proposed
by the committee to extend the giatluation prin-
ciple to those individuals who are already resi-
dent fieeholders of the new States of contiguous
land, to attach to then improvements It is said,
this is giving thema bounty that citizens of other
States do not enjoy To this it may successfully
be answeied that if those settleis have by their
labor and money, m impioving the lands they
have purchased of the Government, increased the
value of contiguous lands that would have been
otherwise valueless, they oughtnot to be deprived
of the benefit of the reduced price Thev are al-
ready settlers, and in many cases the contiguous
lands are of value foi wood or for a range for
stock, to the cultivator of other lands, when you
could not get settlers to locate on them at any
pi ice
I will now, Mr President, examine the giounda
upon which some Senators have placed this bill.
The Committee on Finance attempt to sustain
this as a financial measure—a íehef measure to
an exhausted Treasury It strikes me, sir, that
there has been a gieat change in the policy of
those Senators upon this point within a few years.
It will be recollected by the Senate that, upon the
removal of the public deposits from the United
States Bank to the local banks, the Secretary of
the Tieasury issued a circular to the local deposit
banks, requesting, nay more, requmng them to
loan liberally, to supply the vacuum that would
be created by the withdiawal fiom circulation of
the notes of the Bank of the United States, and it
cannot have been forgotten that the local banks
loaned most liberally, and that the currency of
the country was gieatly increased, that a corre-
sponding rise in the price of produce, as well as in
real estate, followed The public lands remaining
at the maximum price of $1 25 per acie, were,
consequently, not only the safest, but the cheap-
est amele in the maiket in which capital could
be invested, hence the large sales that followed.
The banks were then paying specie, the notes of
the banks could,so far as the amount received for
the public lands was concerned, have been con-
verted into com upon demand, the Treasury was
oveiflowmg, when, all at once, the whole policy
changed, the celebrated specie circular was issued
and maintained upon the open and avowed prin-
ciple that the public lands were selling off too
fast, thatthesalesmustbestopped, that the whole
of the public domain would go into the hands of
speculators, and hence the propriety of arresting
the course by the circular requiung our western
citizens to pay for their lands in specie, while an
eastern debtor to the Government for duties, or
otherwise, could pay in bank paper Yes, sir, the
specie circular was maintained upon the ground
alone of arresting the sales of the public lands,
and upon that ground the President refused to
rescind it And it cannot have been forgotten by
the Senate that, pending the question to rescind
it before the Senate, the Senator from Missouri
[Mr Benton] warned western Senators that the
íepeal would at once throw the whole of the west-
ern domain into the hands of speculators, and
called upon them to resist its repeal I could not
then see with that Senator, and I voted todo away
the discrimination, and, sir, what has been the
