[CHAP. LXIV.

advised of the movement southward of any body of Northern troops which could possibly be formidable as an invading force. Events, however, are thickening, and a very short time may make the aid of our friends in Kentucky very acceptable. In such case you will be promptly advised. The Secretary further directs me to say that your application will receive the full consideration to which he does not doubt it is entitled.

Respectfully, yoru obedient servant,

J. J. HOOPER,

Private Secretary.

President DAVIS:

I have the honor to tender you a regiment of Kentuckians. Do you accept? Your requisition for 3, 000 just reached me from Baton Rouge. Letter opened. Contents sent by may secretary.

TNumbers O. MOORE.

[Indorsement.]

The Kentuckians will be accepted if you tender them as part of the reserve which Louisiana has been asked to hold organized.

JOHN H. MORGAN,

We do not know what a few days may develop. Hope our friends will hold themselves in readiness to respond to any call we may make.

Pensacola, April 17, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

My orders of today will clear my camps of suspicious persons, as you were advised. Martial law has become necessary. My movements have been made known constantly, but I think the office in Pensacola is not responsible. Mr. Le Baron notified you. He has my confidence as fully as any officer of my command, and has most faithfully served our cause.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
