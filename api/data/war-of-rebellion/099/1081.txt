HEADQUARTERS,Broxton's Bridge, February 2, 1865.

General HUMES:

I wish you would cross the Salkehatchie with the greater portion of your command and assist in guarding the crossings of that stream from River's Bridge to Buford's and above as far as possible. Leave 300 or 400 men on the other side, with orders to check the enemy as much as possible and watch his movements. Our men will cross at Morris' Ford and assistant in the defense of that place. I hope you can cross at Buford's Bridge and dispose your men for its defense. Colonel Colcock is picking, or has been directed to picket, from River's Bridge as high up toward Buford's as his force will permit. I wish you to relieve him of that duty, as his force is required below Rivers' Bridge. I except more cavalry here early to-morrow, which will report to you.

Respectfully,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General, Commanding.
