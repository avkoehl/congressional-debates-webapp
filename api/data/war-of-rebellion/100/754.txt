HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Raleigh, April 4, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Smithfield:

COLONEL: There are several batteries of light artillery belonging to my command, now encamped near Smithfield, which are not available for any efficient service in the field. They havefine horses and good men, but only 6-pounder guns and 12-pounder howitzers. As now situated, they are only an expense and source to consume supplies needed for the other troops. It seems to me they should be made available at such a time.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
