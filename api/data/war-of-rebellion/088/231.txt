HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, August 16, 1864-10 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Wilcox's division is all here. Lane and McGowan are on north side of the James, where they have been for some weeks. Thomas and Scales are on the right of Pickett's division in our front here, where they also have been for some six weeks or more. I had not heard from them for a day or two, but to-night have a man from McGowan and have heard direct from Thomas and Scales.

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., August 16, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &c.:

Our troops are now near White's Tavern. You will perceive from the maps this is between the enemy at New Market and Richmond. They will, however, have the road clear to Chaffin's farm. If 1,000 of your men at Dutch Gap could be put under arms and threaten an advance, it might have the effect of starting the enemy on the retreat. In making such demonstration troops would have to start heading down the river, to avoid the batteries near Cox's house.

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 16, 1864-11.15 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Your dispatch received. I have directed the available force, which will amount to about 1,200 men, at Dutch Gap to make the demonstration you suggest. We shall move in that direction with considerable vigor. The only doubt I have is whether the enemy's iron-clads may be able to sweep the plain in front of Dutch Gap. I have ordered Colonel Wooster commanding at Deep Bottom, also to make an advance up the Kingsland road toward its junction with Three-Mile Creek as a feint at the time we open at Dutch Gap.

CITY POINT, VA., August 16, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &c.:

It is now getting so late, and the troops under Hancock being at a stand still, it will be necessary for you to use caution about advancing.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
