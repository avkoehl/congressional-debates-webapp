Major-General.

Should it threaten to turn General Wilcox's right flank, I will give him notice. It is as yet some distance from the Richmond road. The enemy has batteries in redoubts on Grasty's Hill, which strengthens his left flank very materially.

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: The enemy is forming in line of battle on the south side of the Catharpin road.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Most respectfully,

J. E. B. STUART,

Major-General.
