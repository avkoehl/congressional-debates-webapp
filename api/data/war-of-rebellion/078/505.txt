HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Atlanta, September 28, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have just returned from Howard's. I think that a movement of all our cavalry not actually on picket should be made rapidly on Carrollton, to interrupt any communication from Hood's army at Palmetto with his cavalry over about the Tennessee. After striking Carrollton it should move boldly up toward Hood's army, and then draw back to Sandtown.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
