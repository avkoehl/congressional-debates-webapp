Brigadier General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Third Cavalry Division, Washington, D. C.:

(Care of Major General C. C. Augur, commanding Department of Washington.)

Do not lose a moment in getting your division ready to join me. If it will take five or six days to get your other brigade up, get McIntosh ready at once and order him to join me on the north side of the river at this place, and by the shortest route. If you can get the whole of your division ready within three days, join me via Leesburg, Snicker's Gap, and Berryville.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I think, from appearances, I can leave day after to-morrow, time enough to make a day's march. Will do my best, but if the troops do not get here shall I wait longer, or go on with what I may have? You know my command is small at best. What about forage in the Valley? How much should I start with?

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
