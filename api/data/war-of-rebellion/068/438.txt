HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 6, 1864-6 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Sedgwick and Warren are engaged; have been since 5 a.m. No news from Hancock. Would it not be well for Burnside's cavalry to watch our extreme right by the fords, letting them go out on all the roads toward the enemy; and if enough can be spared to cross the river, they might scout on the other side.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
