IN SENATE
Friday, February 28, 1834
Debate on Mr Poimdextlr's resolution, calling
on the Secretary of the Treasury for informa-
tion relative to transfers of the public money
fi om the bank in Natchez to banks in the Atlan-
tic cities
Mr POINDEXTER said he had mtended to
have made borne íemarks upon the resolution, but
if there wa& no objection to its passage, he would
suspend what he had to say umii the answer to
the call came in
Mr TORSYTH said he had certainly no ob
jection to a ca'lior any information winch any gen-
tleman thought proper to make He had no dis-
position to keep back facts, but he thought it an act
of justice to state to the gentleman from Missis-
sippi that he was entirely misinformed In the
remarks which the gentleman made yesterday in
submitting the resolution, he was mistaken in
every fact wh'ch he h d stated. Mr F made this
statement in justice to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, and for the satisfaction of the gentleman from
Mississippi, for he was sure it would give him sat-
isfaction to know that there was no foundation
whatever ir thechaigehe had made Tne facts
were these On the 19 h of the present month, in
answer to a letter of inquiry from the bank at
Natchez upon the sulqeu of the lenioval of the
deposites fro i that institution, the Secietary said
he had no intention to withdiaw or transfer any of
the deposites to the Atlantic cities, that it had
become nece"sary for payment of services m the
removal of the Indians, to transftr $,250 OOOto the
Commercial Bank of Louisiana on the 1st of May
next, and for other like expenses $250,000 more
on the 1st of June, to the Union Bank of Louisi-
ana, at New Oile?ns, or to the Union Bank at
Nashville, at the opa m of the bank at Natchez
The gentleman from Mississippi, therefore, would
pTceive that the whole of his information was
founded in mistake He has said that a million
has been drawn out of the bank Why, the fact
is, there is not as much in it He says the bank
is prevented fiom discounting, but no diafts are
made to prevent them, and the letter to the bank
says expressly that no transfers are contemplated
to the Atlantic cities
Mr POINDEXTER said he might have been
misinformed, but he believed himself to be correct
The fact was the President of the Urn ed States
had biought into the inaiket an immense body of
very valuable lana¿>, which the people could not
pjichase without accommodation at the birks,
that the sale was on very shoit notice, and before
the crops were sold, so as to enable the people to
puichsse, and that the removal of the deposites
to the Planters' Bank pi evented the United States
Bank from discounting, that the Planters' Bank
had c ased to d'scount, because it was compelled
to hold the deposites ready to pay over at a mo
nent'g warning on the requisition of the Secretary
of the Treasury
Mi FORSYTH said he hoped theSenete would
take noth ng fiom him in lieu of the Secretary's
Eeport Bu' when he stated anything heie, he
stated what he believed His mfoi nation was
obtained from his own examination of the docu-
ments There was not a single fact in the state-
ment of the gentleman fiom Missi«siopi that
would not be contiadicted by the public docu-
ments
Mr POINDEXTER Does the gent'eman
mean to impute to me the wilful misstatement of
a fact'
Mr rORSYTII Icallthegeitlenmntoorder
The gentleman will please take his seat I mean
just whit 1 «sav
The VICr PRESIDENT heie interposed, and
called Mr Poindi \tfr to Older, and lie took his
seat
Mr FORSYTH i esumed It was very proba-
bly ti ue that the Planter's Bank was not mas good
condition to benefit the community as the Bank of
14
the United States was But no money was drawn
from the bank, and the bank was expressly in-
formed that no money was intended to be drawn
from it for banks in the Atlantic cities
Mi POINDEXTER read the report of his re-
marks of yesterday from the National Intelligen-
ce! , which he said were substantially correct He
had not staled the facts on his own knowledge If
thegentleman from Georgia [Mr Forsyth] meant
*o impute to him heie the assertion of a fact on
his own authority which he knew to be untrue, he
departed fron the character of an honorable man,
and hewou'dhold himaoeountablefor it Noman
should speak in such a way of him but at the haz-
ard of his life, and no honoiable man would make
such an imputation Astoihe subjectundercon-
sideration, he desired to make the inquiry He
had heard that great speculations had been made
in the West, and also in the Creek country,<by a
Tennessee company, nephews and other relatives
of the P esident of the United States
Mr FORSYTH said, when he made a state-
ment here which he believed to be correct, he
would say so, in utter disregaid and contempt of
the gentleman's displeasure He would not enter
into an aigumert with the gentleman The Gov-
ernment has not drawn a dollar out of the bank,
nor does it intend to diaw a dollar to send to the
4tlantic cities The inference of thegentleman is
false and without any foundation And he (Mr
F ) was sorry that the gentleman was not glad to
find h" was mistaken
Mi POINDEXTER replied that two thirds of
¡ hisiemarks yesterday was matter of inference that
the money was to be sent to support the failing
banks in the East, by transferring it to the Atlantic
cities He now distinctly asked the gentleman
from Georgia if he meant to chaige him with wil
fulm'siep esentation'
Mr FORSYTH Then I shall not answer the
gentleman
Mi  POINDEXTER     Very well
Mr KING, of Alabama, said the gentleman
from Mississippi had done great injustice to the
Pi esident of the United States, not only on this but
on many other occasions Tne President had no
more agency in the saleof thelandsin Mississippi
than the gentleman himself Nor had the Ptes-
ident's nephews, and the gentleman's colleague
knew that it was not the fact He had derived his
informition from those who either knew nothinc
of thefactb or wilfully misiepiesented them True
ihere were speculators there Then  always had
been, and there ever would be, eo long as there
should be sales of lands in the United States In
Ahhama, m consequence of an unfortunate dif-
ference between the government of that State
and the Government of the United States, the Pres-
ident, wuh a paternal solicitude characteristic of
him, and worthy the highest prfuse, determined to
do everything which cou'd be done to effect justice
be'ween theCieeks and the unfortunate settlers
He knew that if they weie driven off at a moment's
warning, downright ruin would overtake them
And when the position assumed by the Executive
of Alabama was made known to the President, he
o-dered the location of i umerous reservations, and
when they weie made, in order to contribute to
the removal of the Indians and turmsh a home to
those who had removed, the lands were brought
to market He mentioned this to show that it was
to save the ruin and expense of a removal that the
sales took place Had the gentleman information
I that a single Tennessean v. as. there' Mr K had
I information that there was not one there The
I lands were sold, but settlers obtained them at the
redjeed prices of the Government
Mr   POINDEXTER said there were persons
here ready to gn e e\ idence of the facts     He (lid
not say the Piesident was concerred in the speeu-
j lations, but his relatives    He intended bringing
the whole subject up for investigation before the
. Senate
Mr GRUNDY said he did not rise for any other
' puipose, but to allude to the imputation upon the
character of Mr McLamoie, the locating agent.
Mr McLamore was his neighbor, he knew him
-veil, and there was not a more honest or honor-
able man in any country He had had a great deal
more to do in locating public lands m Tennessee
than any other man, and he had never heard a sin-
gle word to his prejudice m any of his land trans-
actions And he was the only dealer in public
lands that he had never heard complained of He
was looked up to by his fellow-citizens as the
guardian ard securer of their rights and business
But this Tennessee Company—he would like to
know their names, the whole of it was a secret to
us at home He had never heard of it, although
he had heard as much of the business of Tennessee
as most gentlemen, but ne thought the gentleman
would find that he was mistaken in his information.
Mr G knew that some individual Tennesseeans
had gone to the South for the purpose of specula-
ting in land, but there were no combinations of
men so far as he had learned Thegentleman from
Mississippi had been so informed, but the only
exception he (Mr G ) made to that gentleman was,
his greater facility of belief Now, he ought not
lightly to make such imputations against respect-
able men, or give ciedit to them
Mr CLAY said, perhaps the gentleman who
had just sat down was as liable to the objection
he himself had urged as th  g ntleman from Mis-
sissippi As to the sa'e, the notice was unprece-
dented^ short, and well calculated to produce
these speculations He knew nothing of it him-
self, but he b heved other Senators had also some
information of the sort But he hoped an end
would be put to these disputes by passing the bill
which he had the honor of submitting on a former
occasion.                      *
He nose, however, at this time, to express his
deep regret at an incident which had just occurred
between two honorable Senators Now, he would
submit to the gentleman from Georgia,whether the
two gentlemen were on terms of perfect equably'
How was it' The gentleman from Mississippi
rose in his plaae yesterday, and submitted a res-
olution From information he had received he
made certain inferences, and drew ceitam conclu-
sions, and argued upon those inferences. Now,
how was the gentleman from Georgia situated'
Fie, standing in different relations with the Gov-
ernment from the gentleman from Mississippi,
resorts to the Secretary of the Treasury. The
Secretaiy gives him informa ion, and submits the
documents on the subject to his perusal And the
gentlemsn from Georgia was thus prepared with
the whole official matter, and the gentleman from
Mississippi depnvedof it, in thisstateof inequality
the gentleman from Georgia rises in his place and
pronounces language which he (Mr C ) thought
was rather strong The gentleman's course here
had always been courtly, manly, and open But
on this occasion he applied language which Mr. C
hoped he would reconsider he hoped both the
gen lemen would reconsider what had fallen from
them, and let the matter go no further He hoped
all would wait for the information, which would
be here m a few days, and, in the meantime all
would take pleasure in seeing a reconciliation and
an adjustment of those circumstances which had
given great pain
Mr FORisYTH said, that the gentleman from
Kentucky was mistaken m point of fact He had
not gone to see the Secretary The Secretary
carne to him, and requested him to communicate
to the Senate what he had stated As respected
the inequality of situation which the gentleman
had spoken of, he did not reprehend the gentleman
from Mississippi He gave the information he
had obtained, and it was not until that gentleman
cast a doubt upon him, that he used the strong
language spoken of His simple purpose was to
give to that gentleman and to the people a knowl-
edge of the fact, so that the statement of the gen-
tleman fiom Mississippi might not injure the Sec-
retary of the Treasury He never used language
which he did not think befitted the occasion
