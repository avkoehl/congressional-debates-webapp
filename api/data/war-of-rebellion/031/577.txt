shot in the brick tannery, broke up entirely the annoying fire of sharpshooters, under which we suffered considerably the day before, and for the rest of the day we worked openly in our pits, and fired at all bodies of infantry appearing in town, unannoyed. That night the town was evacuated.

My especial thanks are due to Major J. R. C. Lewis for his cool and efficient co-operation in the execution of all orders. The left of our line of batteries was under his special supervision for the last two days. I desire also to express here my highest appreciation of the gallantry and efficiency of Captains Jordan, Rhett, Moody, Woolfolk, and Parker, before attested on many a hard-fought field and fully corroborated on this.

Captain [J. L.] Eubank, with the remaining battery of my battalion, is absent on detached service. Dr. [H. V.] Gray, surgeon; Captain [P. A] Franklin, quartermaster, and Lieutenant [George D.] Vaughan, commissary, managed their respective departments to my entire satisfaction.

My adjutant, Lieutenant T. Henderson Smith, carried and executed my orders under all circumstances with coolness and judgment.

My especial thanks are also due to Confederate States Cadet Joseph C. Haskell, of South Carolina, who volunteered me his services and rendered me indispensable assistance in the supervision of the extensive a command. I beg leave to recommend him to the War Department for promotion.

Lieutenants [James] Sillers, [Alexander] Wilson, [Dent] Burroughs, [William D.] Terrell, and [James] Woolfolk are mentioned in high terms by their captains, as are also Sergeant [J. L.] Cisco, of Moody's, and Private [William H.] England, of Woolfolk's battery. The latter, unfortunately, was killed.

I was personally impressed with the bearing of Lieutenant J. Donnell Smith, of Jordan's battery, commanding a section in the attack on the evening of the 13th. Corporal [James A.] Logwood, of this company, a most gallant soldier, whom I also noticed particularly, was wounded, I fear mortally, in the night attack.

Our entire loss was 1 killed, 10 wounded, and 15 horses. One thousand and eighty rounds of ammunition were expended.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. P. ALEXANDER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Battalion.

Major G. MOXLEY SORREL,

[Assistant] Adjutant-General, First Corps.
