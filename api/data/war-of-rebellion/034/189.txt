command who were unarmed got guns on the field, and many who had inferior guns, muskets, shot-guns, &amp;c., exchanged them on the field, placing (or, at any rate, so ordered) their old guns in the wagons in lieu of them.

I ordered Colonel [J. H.] Edmondson's regiment and [E. J.] Sanders' battalion to take charge of the prisoners and wagons, and proceed direct to Columbia, via Williamsport. With the balance of the division I moved toward Spring Hill, regulating my march so as to keep on the flank of the commands with the prisoners, so as to meet promptly any attempt at recapture by the enemy's forces at Franklin.

Respectfully submitted.

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General.
