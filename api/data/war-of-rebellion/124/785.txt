were not previously reported in consequence of muster-in rolls not being filed. In the case of the Seventy-first Regiment credited herein (879 men) we have not received the muster-in rolls, and the first rolls here filed for pay show only about 350 men; yet I believe the number 879 claimed for it by the Governor is correct, and have, therefore, credited accordingly.

I am, sir, &amp;c.,

SIR: I arrived at headquarters Department of the Cumberland on Tuesday at 3 p.m. and immediately presented your letter to Major- General Rosecrans. He received me very kindly, and I remained with him until 1 o"clock a.m., in conversation during the intervals of business. He was very free in his expression of opinion, but explicit in his directions, sociable, and I think perfectly reliable; is heartily in favor of the employment of colored troops and will do all he can to forward the work.
