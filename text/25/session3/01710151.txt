penalties of treason, to his escape from the cita-
del of Gluebec
These were the facts which gave rise to this
memorial Upon these facts, the memorialist ap-
peals to Congress to adopt measures for the ad-
justment of this question of perpetual allegiance
claimed by Great Britain from all her native-born
subjects, and for the protection of all such sub-
jects as have become, or may become, naturalized
citizens of the United States The subject was
ceitamly one of great importance The doctrine
of perpetual allegiance, asserted by Great Britain,
was an absurd relic of feudal barbarism It was
incompatible with the Constitution and laws of
naturalization of the United States By those,
Bn'ish subjects may and do become Amencan
citizens Thev aie entitled, equally with our na-
tive citizens, to protection m all their lawful pur-
suits, wherever they may happen to be This
Government was bound thus to protect them, in
peace and in war Mr Madison, in the last war
with Great Bntain, steadily maintained this prin-
ciple, íesisted the claim of that kingdom to the
peipetual allegiance of hei subjects after they had
become oui citizens, and repeatedly intimated his
determination to retaliate foi every injury inflicted
upon our naturalized citizens, captuied as pris-
oneis of wai,if they were punished on thegiound
of their being subjects, 01 if they were treated dif-
ferently from other pnsoners of war The me-
morialist was mistaken in supposing that the
tieaty of peace between this countiy and Gieat
Britain recognized the right of that kingdom to
the perpetual allegiance of her native bom sub-
jects No such expression is to be found in those
tieaties Our ¡evolutionaly ancestors weie all
British subjects at one time In separating from
the mothei country, they ceased to be her sub
jects And how could they, in the treaty of peace
which recogniztd them is a sepaiate and inde-
pendent nation, peimitGreat Butam toasseitany
claim to the peipetual allegiance of those who
woe born within the British realms'
No pnnciple is more clear than that the natu-
ralized citizens of the United States possessuall the
ngnt, andaie entitled to all the protection, which
could be claimtd by native citizens No duty is
moie imperative upon the Government than that
of affoiding equal piotcction to the natuiahzed as
to the native citizen, and he had no recollection
of any failure on the part of any Republic or
any Administration to perform its duty in this
lespect
The cucumstances which had produced this
memonal were peculiar, andhad embarrassed any
action which the Government might have been
disposed to take on the subject Thememonalist
had, in his zeal for the liberty of a fortign piov-
mce not piepaied to assert its own freedom, in-
vaded that foreign prowncc had, with a number
of oui native citizens, waged war upon the Brit-
ish authonties, while his own country was at
peace and amity with them, and had been cap-
tuied He and his coadjutors had voluntarily,
at least for a time, expatriated themselves They
had left then own country to engage m a foreign
civil wai Now, in this situation, what right had
our Government to exercise us power for their
piotection, except by way of friendly interposi-
tion If the mcmoualist had been taken while
fighting the battles of his adopted countiy, if,
without committing aggression upon the estab
hshed Government of a foreign Power, he had,
while passing thiough any pirt of its dominions,
been taken on any pretext, and tried for anv of-
fense not committed against the peace of that
Power, and condemned on the claim of a perpet
ual allegiance from him, then this Government
would have been bound to inteipose for his pio
tection, and would have niotected him As it
was, the Executive acted with legard to him pie-
cisely as it did with legaid to native citizens cap-
tured at the same time with him It sent an agent
to Toionto for the purpose of prevailing with the
provincial authorities to release the pnsoners, it
made no distinction between the natuiahzed and
the native citizen What more could it do, with-
out involving the nation m a war' It mighthave
made a foi rial declaration that it would never rec-
ognize the principle of perpetual allegiance, as
assei ted in the tnal and condemnation of the mc-
moualist It might, as intimated by the Seuatoi
fiom Kentucky, have remonstrated against that
baibaious principle, but if it had done so, the
danger was, that he would have been forthwith
ordeied to execution, for the very purpose of
showing a determination practically to maintain
the British claim to the perpetual allegiance of
their subjects He had no doubt that this con-
sideration had operated upon the Executive in
this case He had alluded to these facts to show
that this Government had not been inattentive to
its duty on this occasion
He concurred with the memorialist in the praise
awarded to the emigrants from Europe to this
country They weie among our most useful and
patriotic citizens They were to be found side
by side with our native citizens, " in every field
of honorable enterprise " They were inaustri
ous,zealous, energetic, in whatever direction they
turned their attention In council, at the polls,
wheiever their adopted country's good demanded
then devotion, their patriotism was equaled only
by their manly boldness In the battle field, their
fearless daung and comage were pioverbial In
the humble hut, in the moie elevated dwelling,
in their domestic íelations, they were equally
kind hearted and hospitable They were entitled,
equally with the native citizen, to the protection
of our laws The national faith had been sa
credly pledged and observed towards them, and
he, for one, would never faltei in his determina
tion to see that faith, hereafter, fully redeemed in
regaid to all the pledges which then migration
hither, and then adoption as citizens, required us
to redeem Less than this they could not ex-
pect, more than this they do not ask
He hoped that the subject would be referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations That
veiy able committee would bestow upon it every
attention which its impoitance demanded, and if
they could present a law oradeclaiation by which
our naturalized citizens could be moie effectually
secured in all their constitutional and legal rights,
and foreign Powers admonished that they would
be lequned to treat our citizens of that descnp
tion in pieciselv the same way in which native
Amei leans were treated by them, no man would
moie sinctrely lejoicc than he would Hetrusted
that some effective measure could be suggested
All the evils of wai ought to be encountered to
maintain the lights of our naturalized citizens,
as conferred upon them by the Constitution and
laws of the United States
The memonal was then refeired to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, and ordered to be
printed

REPORTS FROM COMMllTEES.
Mr BUCHANAN, from the Committee on
Foreign Relations, to which was refeired the bill
for the relief of Charles S Walsh, reponed the
same without amendment
Mr SEVIER, from the Committee on Indian
Afians, lepoited, without amendment, the bill
for the íelief of Richard Banks
Mi LINN obseived that the Committee on
Private Land Claims had been assiduously en-
gaged, for the last three years, in the discharge
of their duties, and had íeported a number of
bills, which had passed the Senate, though but
very few of them had been sanctioned by the
otliei House, the otheis having failed foi want
of time Now, this was very burdensome on the
committee, and he hoped that this year they
would be moie foitunate To avoid the difficul-
ties which had hitherto stood in the way of these
bills, he would move that, for the remainder of
the session, the Saturdays of each week be set
apart for then consideiation
This motion was agreed to
On motion of Mi BROWN, the Committee
on Revolutionaiy Claims was discharged from
thefuithereonsideration of the resolution m favor
of the heir  of Robert Walker, and the petition
of the heirs of William Meruit
Mi WALL, from the Committee on the Ju-
dieiary, to which was refeired the bill to prevent
the lmerfeience of ceitam Federal officers m elec-
tions, made a special íeport theieon
The report having been read,
Mr CRITIENDEN observed that this bill
had been in the hands of the committee about a
month and a half, of which he did not complain,
as they had a right to give the subject the most
I ample consideiauon He only desired that an
early period might be allowed him for a discus-
sion of tins subject He desired to bring to the
notice of the Senate the sophistries by which this
gieatest vice m our system was defended He
thought that the respect due to a member of the
body might have allowed the gentleman some
moie tempeiance of language in expiessmg his
disapprobation of the bill He now moved that
the bill be postponed to, and made the order of
the day foi, this day week
Mr HUBBARD had no objection to the mo
tion He called for the reading of the report,
because he confessed that he was somewhat sur-
prised at the reading of the bill of the Senator
fiom Kentucky All he now rose for was to
move that the íeport be printed, and also for the
printing of an extra number of copies, and to
test the sense of the Senate, he would move for
the printing often thousand extra copies
The report was here oideied to be printed,and
the question arising on the motion to punt the
extra copies,
Mi    NORVELL suggested  the propriety of
ordering twenty thousand copies of thisrepoitto
be punted     Notwithstanding the chaiacter as-
cribed to it by the Senator from Kentucky, he
consideied theieportan unanswei able response
to a bill which proposed to stake down the vital
ami fundamental lights of a large portion of the
legal \ oteis of the United States    He desired all
his constituents to see this report     He should,
therefore, picfer the printing of twenty thousand
| to the smallei numbei proposed
J     "I he question was then taken, and ten thousand
exti i copies of the bill and reprrt weie ordeied
i to be printed
