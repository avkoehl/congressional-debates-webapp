CITY POINT, VA., August 20, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding, &amp;c.:

The Tenth Corps - in fact, all the troops from north of the James - are ordered to return to-night. When this change is made it will probably induce the enemy to strengthen his weak point in your front before we can take advantage of it. If you can get thought, however, I should like it very much. In regard to sending you the colored troops of the Ninth Corps, it is now impossible. The Eighteenth Corps and colored troops of the Ninth Corps are holding all of our line at Petersburg, whilst the white troops of the Ninth are operating with the Fifth Corps.
