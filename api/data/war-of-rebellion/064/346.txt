General FISK:

We live in Keytesville, Mo. I think Captain Truman has has a good effect in our neighborhood in cleaning out the bushwhackers, and I don't think we will have any more trouble in our neighborhood. Every man is a coming into Keytesville, and says he will assist in driving them out, and inform on them whenever he hears of one.

Brigadier General CLINTON B. FISK:

I started men yesterday as directed by you, under charge of an officer, Captain E. K. Smith, who will see that Truman obeyed your order. I suppose he will not overtake Truman until he reaches Brookfield. Would it not be better for me to go to that place to-day and bring Sergeant Westly with me to your headquarters? Captain Smith is to telegraph me immediately what he accomplishes, and I will let you know as soon as he does.

Brigadier General CLINTON B. FISK:

Captain Smith telegraphs from Brookfield that he has arrived there, and that H. T. has turned over everything but the negroes to the quartermaster there. H. T. wants 5 men to go with him to Saint Joseph. I have ordered Captain Smith here with everything, and told him to send H. T. on without any men.
