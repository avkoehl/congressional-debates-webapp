over again, and discussed with grpat ability by
men of talent and learning in the^e Halls. He
now came to that part of ihe subject which was
somewhat tedious, and which hid ott^n been f x-
a«iined. Before he vent into the consideration of
the detds of cess on, he wished to look into a few
of the fads in order to see v, hat was the mtrive
which induced the State;-, and partienWrfy Virgi-
nia, to make a cession oí their land>, bccau.-e, in
construing the law, it was always advisable- to
consider the evil that exist*, and aiVrva'da the
remedy. [Here Mr. C. read from a docutntnt
showirg what the Stales were that en'cied into the
Confederation.] All these States, came Uto the
Confederation except Maryland, who profps'ed
against it on tho ground that she had a common
claim to the waste lands, because they v;ere th* 
common prop'ity of all the Stvte?, and sh^1 in-
structed her delegate* to the convention as ") brw
they should act in reference to that subject. [Here
Mr. C. read the in&truct:on% and al&o the de d of
cession of New York.]
Now, by th's deed, it seemed the cession wss
made with a view to establish public credit. Yes,
to establish public credit; and yet it was now pro-
posed to lay a duty o* twenty percent on luxuries.
He would tell the gentleman from Maryland that
he would get but little íevenue from that ^ourc<*,
perhaps not mi ch more than §200,000. In 1780
Congress passed a resolution ia reference to the
pablic lands, and * in February, 178Í, Maryland
passed resolutions to join the Confederacy; and a-11
that Maryland c'aimrd, a« hi (Mr. C ) underwood
from the record*  ot ihv proceriir.ps of her Lcg'sia-
ture, was, as he had already said, to at ail the va-
cant or wa^te laads v/vre th- Rfinnum property of
the Union; and th it opinion w:-s manüa n:-d by ail
the S'ate-*, except'bev who put forth a .-¿párate
and independent cla'm '.o prop*rt/. [H>re iUr C.
read extracts from th.1 ikeds of cession rf New
Yo.k, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connection South
Carolma, £*.nd Noith Carolina, a^d then a-lOed that
the Constitution of ihe (Jn ted Sute,-; wa> framed m
'87, and went into opsra ion in '89 ]
Now it had been contended that the power <*f
Congress to dispose of the lands resulted from the
deeds of cession; and h* had uoiei>foo i the gen*
tfeman froaa Maryland to huve bafed his argument
upon this gioutid, as a cntiruMnnai «¡round. Mr.
C. adverted to what had been M*1. Clay's opinion*
on this particular point, as agreeing with those ad-
vanced by tb£ gentleman from Maryland, and ob-
served thai Mi. Clay had i-.ba-idoned ¡hat groun),
and that he no v heíiíve* the C^nstitatioa oveird.-s

veto message of G^ner-tl 3Vk~- -n on ¡he subject ^f
the pubhc lands, and then hi sa d it cam¿ to a very
sensible and jo*t conclu.-fn. He ."ould ner

gentleman, [Mr* Web Trn ] -'.-ho,  n wow able
speech made in the lavf CoKgre-^, said, in sub-
stance, that he himself had n-ver under ?\::a 'o

1 hy the yaid, whether that petition was. f>0 or 5tK' yards m
length, could have any influence in deciding the raeritsofa
question to be discussed on principles ofconatitutionat right.
Mr. CLAY asked leave to say a few woTds. if the Senator from
Pennsylvania an.i hi* friends would really undertake to listea
calmly to the good Whig in New York and his Loco Foco con-
verts, he (Mr. Ci.ay) did not know hut he would send for them
to effect some change He really thought if they would calmly
discuss the principles of the measure-reveii as fie had said be-
fore, over a chew of tobacco, or glass of grog, laying aside
their Jackson notions of yellow-boy currency—-they would
very soon become converts, too, and, instead of a useless oppo-
sition, .would be touiid perfecting a measure which,they would
soon feel satisfied was called for by the best interests'of tha,
country
Mr. BUCHANAN. Well, sir, I cannot undertake for my
fnenda to gay what they-will do; but I will tell the honorable
Sena'or from Kentucky, whatl myself will do, and what Í will
not do. I will not undertake to chew tobacco and drink grog
with his New York Whig advocate, and four or five converted
Loco Focos but i will, as I have often done before, have no ob-
jection toa gla^with the Senator himself, and listen to his
arguments with a sincere desire of discovering in them any
thing which 1 have hitherto failed to discover, to satisfytme
that he is right and í am wrong. It is too much to ask me to
to take ¡none dose, so many chews of tobacco, and glasses of
íírog together, with arguments for conversion.
Mr CLAY. Wpllfsir, take them in broken dosea. Any
thing,,sir, for a good effect.
Here the subject dropped; and the following memorials and
petitions were presented and laid on the table:
By Mr. .HENDERSON: From citizens of Mississippi, in Ik-
favor ofa general bankrupt law.
X?y Mr. BUCHANAN. From citizens of Philadelphia, (mer-
chants and ethers,) remonstrating against the passage of any
bankrupt law
By Mr MOREHEAD: From citizens of Kentucky, for the
enactment of auvnsral bankrupt law.
By Mr WiUCRT- From citizens of New York, against the
passage of abankropt law.
Also, one l rom an individual asking that a law may be imme-
diately enacted to leheve all debtors irom their responsibilities
on the surrender ol eveiy thing save their clothing.
The Senate then took'up tie íesolution submitted by Mr.
t'rciiANAN. eaüing for the names of all persons removed since
the 4'h of M.11H1 lest, pending to which is the amendment of
Mr Mangt-m, calling, in addition thereto, for all the removals
fiom tin- Ph of M'ldi, 1829, to the *th of March, 1841.
, Mr. MAXGVM ?poke ofthe time already wasted in profit-
]p=.-í di-rais^i as on the subject, it having already been before
that body tor a week If gentlemen really desired the infor-
mation, they roidd have obtained it, with agreat deal more, by
admitnnr the amendment. But the rea! object appeared to be
to occupy ihe time of the,Senate m uttering phillipics -and de-
nunciations af.anst the present Admimstiauon. As he had no
disposition to wa-te the time of the Senate, he would moye to
lay the subject on the table.
Mi   PiKRCE asked the Penawr to withdraw the motion.
Mr MANGUM said he would if the Senator would re-
new it.
Mr PIERCE Mid he would not promise to make amotion
win' h would cut off any of hi^ friends from participating in the
debate.
Mr PRE^TOX appealed to his fuend fro/n North Carolina
I Mi. Manci'mI to withdraw his motion. He was utterly op- *
1'[Had to ibis-- nm 1j o, choking debate,, and went for the utmost
liberty of iiu..eensed speech. Let the debate proceed;
it might piomijg the session a week or two, but
tin,- was better than to give Senators on- the other
sh)~ catire for onnolaint that they were not allowed to be heard,
and produce the niipresson on the country that the friends of
the AdminisiKtiion were unwilling or unable to defend its
conduct Let the debate, then, go on-and they could amply
justify all the removals that had taken place.
Mr. CUTHHERT returned the Senator from South Carolina
his trunks for th<- sentiments he had juet uttered. They were
bpenmnüth'' '. t'laut St .¡e which he represented, and remind-
ed hun [Mr C i.'i hvgone day-, when the Senator's associations
\\eif ot a k' 'f i"ni thrfidCter.
M¡ li!;N T iN ri.ivp notiee that he intended to debate the mo-
il ,(-.; and 'ha* 1> vuuiki do so, not by the permission of any rr.e
on that Uooi, b-'t in his light as a Senator ofa sovereign State.
The mono!' '■" lay on the tjble was withdrawn.   And
Mi  PIERCE > ommei.ee.i ins remarks, and spoke up to the
time for takip<> ni> ¡hp special order, without having concluded.
FISCAL RANK OF THE UNITED STATES!.
The Senmk then proceeded to the discussion of the speeial
order, b-'ine thr hill to incorporate 'he subscribers to the Fiscal
Ba.ik'of the L'nied States.
Mi !I' M>E!f SON moved to amend the 10th section so as
tooxJuie ham ihe purchase of stock all persons other than
