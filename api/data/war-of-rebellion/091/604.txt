GENERAL: The chief of cavalry directs that you make a reconnais- sance with the whole of your command up the Strasburg pike to-morrow a. m. at daylight. Direct the force you now have at the junction of the White Post and Newtown road with the Front Royal pike to join you at Newtown as you pass. General Custer moves with his command up the country on the right of the pike and General Powell up the Front Royal pike. You will have your command saddle light.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,Near Charlestown, Va., November 11, 1864.

Captain A. E. DANA,

Asst. Adjt. General, First Cav. Div., Middle Military Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the railroad is now nearly built to Summit Point, Va. I protect the working party. A brigade of infantry protect the road from Summit Point to Charlestown, and I understand that Brigadier-General Stevenson will protect the road from Charlestown to Harper's Ferry. On the 11th instant I sent in two wagons of the Second U. S. Cavalry to Harper's Ferry with a guard of one sergeant and ten men. Captain Mobberly, with twenty-five men, most of them dressed in our uniform, attacked them between Charlestown and Halltown, killing one sergeant, capturing five of the men and the mules attached to the wagons. Three hundred of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, stationed at Charlestown, sent a party in pursuit, and captured two of the mules. I shall move to-morrow to some place near Summit Point. Mosby has now with him White's Imboden's, and Mobberly's men-in all, I suppose, a force of 700 men.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. CROWNISHIELD,

Lieutenant Colonel Second Massachusetts Cavalry, Comdg. Brigade.

GENERAL: The chief of cavalry directs that you move forward the whole of your command to-morrow a. m. at daylight, up the country, on the right of the pike, to make a reconnaissance. The force you now have at or in the vicinity of Fawcett's Gap you will leave there for the protection of your right flank. General Merritt moves up the pike at the same hour, and General Powell up the Front Royal pike. You will move your command saddled light.

Yours, very respectfully,

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,
