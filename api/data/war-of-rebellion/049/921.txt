HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,Harper's Ferry, Va., October 14, 1863.

Lieutenant S. B. McCULLOCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of this date, and in reply would say I am unable to give any reason, other than in the words of Colonel Simpson, as to why the scout (which was a cavalry scout) did not succeed: "They were unable to proceed along the crest of the mountain." An infantry scout sent out sometime since by General Lockwood in the same derection returned and reported the road impassable.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Lieutenant S. B. McCULLOCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that I am informed by Colonel Simpson of the return of the scout of two men sent to the Blue Ridge, they having proceeded as far as Berryville, when they met part of Gilmor's battalion. He now has scouts out to go as far as Keys' and Meyers' Fords, with orders to report any information they may gain. He reports a small number of rebels at Smithfield, but can learn of no force in the valley.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 15, 1863.

Major-General HUNPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I gave what information I had to the colonel of the First Maine Cavalry, and have orderlies from him to communicate any information I receive. He has been off for an hour. My cavalry provost guard were out to within 2 miles of the battle-field this morning, and have returned about half an hour ago. Two of our tired men on the battle-field were fired on this morning by the enemy, and they escaped. The provost guard brought in all stragglers. Tell General Pleasonton I have kept his two batteries till the artillery-reserve batteries General Hunt was to send me arrive; they will then go in, all my batteries having gone back to replenish. My infantry is unsuppleid with ammunition, and provisions are coming up. Men are somewhat tired and sore, but in good fighting condition. We have seen a column, apparently our own, about 2 miles east of Blackburn's Ford on a road, moving northward. We suppose it was our troops moving toward Centreville from Blackburn's Ford.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
