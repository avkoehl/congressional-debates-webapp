Captain [W. F.] NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Incessant fire from Yankee mortar and Parrott battery. Can't work negroes; better look after them promptly. Had 30 or 40 soldiers wounded in an attempt to work. Will do all I can, but fear the garrison will be destroyed without injuring the enemy. The fleet is opening, but I hope that we may stand till do-night.

KEITT,

Colonel.
