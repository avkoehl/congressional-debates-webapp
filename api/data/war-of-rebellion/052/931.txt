PICKET LINE, September 29, 1863-5.30 a.m.

[General REYNOLDS:]

The enemy were busy cutting timber during the night in front of Davis' and Johnson's lines, and were moving either wagons or artillery from about 3 a.m. to 4.30 a.m. From the sound of the reveille this morning, they appear to have more force on our right than heretofore. The wagons or artillery I speak of were moving from the enemy's rear and right toward our front and right. The sound of vehicles of some description moving toward our right can still be heard, 5.30 a.m.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JAMES A. CONNOLLY.

Pickets on left of our advance lines report enemy very busy carrying rails, digging, &c. Not known whether they are building bridge, battery, or breastworks; this is across Chattanooga Creek, but almost close upon our lines. General Thomas is notified.

Major-General.

Colonel P. SIDNEY POST:

General Jenkins has just sent word to me to withdraw my pickets from the south side of the creek (fronting my right), or he will drive them. He says there is an agreement between him and General Rosecrans that he creek shall be the line between the armies. I have requested him to wait until I could communicate with General Rosecrans.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JASON MARSH,

Colonel Seventy-fourth Illinois Volunteers.
