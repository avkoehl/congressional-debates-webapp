APRIL 22-24, 1863.-Expedition from Belle Plain to Port Conway and Port Royal, Va.

Extract from "Record of Events," Fourth Brigade, First Division, First Army Corps.*

The Twenty-fourth Michigan Volunteers, of this brigade, in accordance with orders from headquarters of the First Division, marched with three days' rations in haversacks, in company with the Fourteenth New York Volunteers, from Belle Plain, Va., on April 22, 1863, at 1.30 p. m., toward Port Conway, Va. Bivouacked about 10 p. m. about one-half mile in rear of the village of Port Conway.

About 3 a. m. of the 23d, the regiment was under arms and marched into the village. Twenty men were picked from each company to set up boats and cross the river to Port Royal. Owing to a heavy rain, and the entire ignorance of the men as to the manner of constructing the boats, the work was not completed and the crossing effected until nearly 6 a. m. At that hour, thirteen boats crossed the Rappahannock without opposition. Parties were sent in different directions through the village of Port Royal. A wagon-train was captured and destroyed, several prisoners taken, and a mail captured. The boats returned to Port Conway about 9 p. m., and the expedition commenced its march toward camp about 11 a. m., at which place it arrived about 7.30 p. m. It rained continuously all day, and the roads were almost impassable
