The following has just been received from General Gillem, at Bull's Gap, 4th:

"I surprised, defeated, and killed John Morgan at Greenville this morning. The killed are scattered for miles, and have not yet been counted; probably number from 50 to 100; prisoners 70, among them Morgan's staff. Captured 1 piece artillery and caisson. The enemy's force outnumbered mine, but the surprise was complete.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

Yours, with dispatch, is received. Good. I hear from Granger, at Pulaski, that he drove Wheeler from the railroad from Nashville to Decatur, and that he moved east. He also says that Roddey has gone across the Tennessee. Granger, Rousseau, and Steedman are all after Wheeler. Telegraph Ammen to try and stop Wheeler's exit to the east by blocking roads and intrenching gaps. You know how easily 200 or 300 men can close absolutely some of those narrow defiles.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, September 6, 1864.

General HOWARD:

General Thomas had given orders to move out at 7 a.m. I would prefer we should not leave too early, as the enemy would crow over it. I wish you would modify your orders, and assure yourself that the enemy has no heavy force of infantry at Jonesborough, before you leave his old trenches; 7 o'clock will be early enough; you only have seven miles to make to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
