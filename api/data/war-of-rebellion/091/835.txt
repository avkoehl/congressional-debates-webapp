General STEVENSON:

If I were to put a division of 3,000 cavalry at or near Lovettsville, in Loundoun County, how long could it be supported from the forage in that county? Answer.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I think from all that I can learn a division of 2,500 cavalry could subsist abundantly near Lovettsville for the winter. I had and estimate made of the hay and corn that could be gotten-which was 1, 5000 tons of hay and 150,000 bushels of corn.
