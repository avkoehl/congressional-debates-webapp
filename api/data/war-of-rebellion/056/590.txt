nition has been sent to you at Brandon. Supply General Chalmers as far as you can. More will be sent to you as soon as it arrives." He also telegraphed on the same day to Lieutenant Buck: "Call on Captain Clark, who will issue what he can from Brandon. More will be sent you as soon as it arrives. I cannot wholly supply you."

No dispatch was received by Major Kennard from you asking for sixty boxes of 57 ammunition.

Ammunition was sent to Brandon by train for you on Saturday and Sunday morning. On another occasion 40,000 54 caliber and 7,200 navy pistol cartridges were sent. Apply to Captain Clark and he will furnish you.

By command of General Johnston:

T. B. LAMAR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LIVINGSTON, October 25, 1863.

Major-General LORING,

Canton:

DEAR GENERAL: I forward the two reports from General Cosby. I am of the opinion that our Northern friends will pay us a visit soon. I may possibly be mistaken, but it is better that we should prepare to welcome them. I would, therefore, suggest, if it is perfectly convenient, that you will ride out to see me tomorrow, when we will take a look at the country about this place, to select the best points for defense, &amp;c.

Yours, very truly,

W. H. JACKSON.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS LORING'S DIVISION,Canton, October 25, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian:

COLONEL: Agreeably to General Jackson's suggestion, I leave for Livingston in the morning for the purpose of examining the country.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General, Commanding.

OCTOBER 26, 1863.

I think it is likely as reported that the arrival of troops at Vicksburg is true. I received information some days since that Smith's division was expected to return from Arkansas, but the statement General Jackson forwards makes it out greater.

Respectfully,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General, Commanding.
