FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Major-General BLUNT,

Leavenworth:

You will proceed at once to Olathe and report to me for orders.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FOR LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

Scouts just in from front report Lexington taken and enemy near Independence advancing on that place. This, I suppose, may be bushwhackers or a cavalry force under Shelby. Lines open at Sedalia. Report no news from Price's main force, last reported at Jefferson City.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to commanding officers at Wyandotte, Olathe, Paola, Mound City, and Fort Scott.)

FOR LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

The Governor has called out the entire militia of the State. I want this given the widest circulation and the most prompt action.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to all commanding officers.)

PAOLA, October 9, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

The militia are called out, but now under my control. The concentration is at Olathe. I consider this wrong. The Miami County regiment should be here, where our supplies and quartermaster's stores are. Were I compelled to draw my troops from here the Government property would be at the mercy of twenty bushwhackers. The men will be gone; the women and children now are scared to death.

T. MOONLIGHT,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Lawrence, October 9, 1864.

Colonel T. MOONLIGHT,

Commanding Sub-District Numbers 2, Paola, Kans.:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding the district directs that when the siege guns now en route for Olathe and Paola arrive at their destination that you have them placed in position immediately, and make a sufficient detail from the command at those post to work them. These details will be kept up and drilled daily in working the guns
