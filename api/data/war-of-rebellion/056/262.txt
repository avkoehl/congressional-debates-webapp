it), but that it must be done in an orderly and legitimate manner. I propose to eat up all the surplus, and perhaps the entire crops in the country, take all serviceable stock, mules, horses, &amp;c., so that when we leave here no rebel army, if it should ever get here, can live a day. These people are proud, arrogant rebels, who beg our protection, but wish to be allowed at the same time to oppose our armies and our Government. The hands of all Federal officers should fall justly but heavily upon them, so that they should respect us-not from love, for they never will do that, but from fear of the power of our Government. Now I propose, so far as I can, to let these people know that we are at war; that we are in a country of rebels, and that they must support my command, respect and obey my orders, and that all they possess belongs legitimately to the U. S. Government. If they bring it to me freely I propose to pay for it, not that it is their right, but that it is cheaper for us and for the Government. If I go after it I never pay. I never ask them to take the oath, but treat them as they act. Every rebel takes the oath to save his property. I know no Union man in this country unless he openly declares and shows by his acts that he is willing and ready to shoulder a musket in our cause. My soldiers know the penalty of any violation of orders; they also know what is proper and right, and if detected in wrong-doing will be punished to the extent of the law.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

SIR: I have examined into the affairs of the commissary department here. I find Captain Sam. J. Little, commissary of subsistence, has in store here 2,573,839 rations of salt meats, 4,500,100 rations flour and hard bread, 3,368,892 rations of beans and pease, 2,533,680 rations of rice and hominy, 4,907,283 rations of coffee and tea, 4,962,219 rations of sugar, and small rations in proportion. The following-named commissary supplies have been sent to the front from the 15th of October to the 24th instant, to wit: 2,679,759 rations of salt meats, 4,909,560 rations of flour and hard bread, 2,233,250 rations of beans and rice, 4,860,700 rations of coffee and tea, 4,732,250 rations of sugar, and small rations in proportion. The Cumberland River is in good boating order, and I hope to be enabled to accumulate a large amount of commissary supplies at this point ere the water in the river gets too low.
