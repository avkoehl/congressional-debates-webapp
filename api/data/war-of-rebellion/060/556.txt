HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., February 12, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: I regret to state that 53 loyal North Carolinians were captured at the outposts during the recent operations. Had I been here I should have kept them in our main defenses, since nearly all of them are deserters from the rebel service. My impressions are they will try them and punish them severely in view of the crumbling condition of the Confederacy. Doubtless extra severity will be meted out because they are North Carolinians.

Fear of detection and death in case of capture will, I fear, break up our recruiting service, which has been so successful. Under the circumstances I deem it my duty to call upon General Pickett for the same protection and treatment for these prisoners as was extended to the others. I much need your advice in this matter, and hope you will be able to give it in time.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. PECK,

Major-General.
