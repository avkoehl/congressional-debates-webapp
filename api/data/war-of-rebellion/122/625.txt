HARRISBURG, November 8, 1861.

Honorable T. A. SCOTT:

I can purchase 5,000 Enfield rifles at $26 per rifle, to be paid for after inspection, and deliverable in three days. Including Davis' and Dodge's, we are sending eleven regiments as rapidly as transportation can be had, and many of them without arms. Can you not send on some one authorized and inspect at once? Answer immediately, and do this for the State.

Governor.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

We cannot purchase the Enfield rifles at any price above $20. All the guns coming to this country have been purchased at $18, $19, or $20, and any parties outside offering to sell for more are trying to speculate on the Government.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN,

Can you attach a sufficient number of companies, some two or three, to Colonel John M. Power's regiment? Fill it up and send it on.

Acting Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., November 9, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

If you will direct three companies to be taken from Ziegle's regiment, in Camp Cameron, to fill Power's, it shall be done. Ziegle is not here, and his regiment cannot fill.
