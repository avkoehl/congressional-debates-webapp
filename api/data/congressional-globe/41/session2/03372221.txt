ests of the district that I have the honor to rep-
resent in this House.
First, as to the amount of lumber-produced,
and the cost of production;
The statistics of the pine lumber business of
the Saginaw valley for the year XS69 show that
there were in operation on the Saginaw river,
exclusive of eighteen small mills in the in-
terior and tributary to the river, 83 saw-
mills, running 1§7 saws, and with a cutting
capacity of G27,§87,841 feet of manufactured
lumber. These mills, with docks attached and
mill-site property, are valued at $3,754,000.
They cut during the season of 1860, 523,500,-
880 feet of lumber, 51,754,221 pieces of lath,
and furnished employment to 2,909 men dur-
ing the operating season, Embraced within
the same territory are 38 shingle-mills, valued
at $295,500, employing 527 men, and which
cut during the season of 1809, 119,843,500
shingles. As showing the growth of this im-
portant interest, I subjoin a comparative state-
ment of the lumber business of the Saginaw
valley during the past three years:

1889  523,500,830 51,754.221 119,843,500
During 1869 there were manufactured 1,800,-
000 pickets, against 800,000 the year previous.
Of hard wood and oak timber there were
bought and shipped from the Saginaw valley
during 1809, as follows:
Oak timber, cubic feet  705,000
Staves, oak    3,5iO,dOO
Hoops         0,408,950
The pine lumbering operations of the Sag-
inaw valley alone gave, during tho_ season of
18G9, employment to over 11,000 direct oper-
atives. which may be divided into the follow-
ing classes, with the average wages per diem
affixed:

The pine lumber product, when reduced lo
its cash value, computing at prices realized
during 1809, would be as follows;
523,500,830 foot lumber at$12 031 $0,805,190 00
51,754,221 pieces lath at 1 50   77,031 33
119,843,500 shingles at 4 00   479,3/4 00
1,800,000 piokets at 12 00   21.1M0 00
Total         87,383,801 33
The price of lumber, as with other market-
able commodities, anil from the same causes,
varies. As far as the object of this statement
is concerned, the prices realized last year may
be considered a proper basis of calculation.
The percentage of upper lumber received from
the several streams tributary to the Saginaw
river was about 12 per cent. Taking, then,
the average price realized during the season,
wo find that the average amount realized from
the whole production is $12 031 per thousand
feet, as follows: .
15 per cent, culls, at So 50  82',
73 per cent, common, at $11  83 03
12 per cent, upper, at $34   4 08
Average price for 1,000 feet  $12 93!-
As illustrating the small margin for profits
in the lumber business, I present herewith a
detailed statement of the expense of getting
out and manufacturing pine logs into lumber
from the time they leave the tree until piled
on the dock for shipment—average distance
that logs are drawn to (stream 2J- miles:

In addition to the permanent investment in
mill property it, must he borne in mind that to
maintain and carry on this largo business a
large active or floating capital is required, such
as teams, sleds, tools, &c.; also cash to carry
stock from year to year. I have no data from
which to give this amount, but estimate it equal
to §4 per 1,000 on (he entire product, or at least
§2,000,000. Adding this to mill property will
show an investment of §0,040,500. Thus it is
shown that from this large investment of over
§0,000,009 the return is but about 15 per cent,
on the capital.
It, will bo noticed that in these calculations
no mention is made of taxes, State, national,
or local. When these are taken into account,
and dealers, and manufacturers' licenses are
paid, the net result will barely reach 10 per
cent,., or not over $1 per 1,000 to the profit
ot'the business, or an. amount about one half
the duty on Canadian lumber.
£ have confined myself lo the Saginaw river
proper. [ might have included the h'lint,
Au Sable, ntul Alpetia interests as being com-
prised in what, is usually termed the Saginaw
valley lumber district. These points produce
about lire same relative quality of lumber, and
show about the same relative cost of manufac-
ture as Saginaw proper.
The lumber production of tho State of Mich-
igan, as shown by statistics of 1809, is about
2,000,000,000 Joel, and may be divided among
the following districts:

Giving as a total production of the three pine
lumber States of the Northwest 3,049,804,421
feet, or in round numbers 3.000,000,000 feet
of lumber, winch to get out and manufacture
requires an active working capital of nearly
$50,000,000, and gives employment (taking the
calculation for the Saginaw river as a basis) to
080,000 men.
Assuming that these men have families con-
sisting of four persons each, and we have
2,720,000 people in the three States ot Mich-
igan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, to be fed and
clothed hy the grain, wool, and cotton-pro-
ducing portionsof the country. Hiis business
furnishes the best market for grain, vegetables,
beef, pork, butter, and eggs to be found m the
country, the prices in these lumber-producing
districts always averaging higher than in other
localities.
Strike down this manufacturing business,
and you have, added to the list of men now-
employed in agricultural pursuits, (which pro-
fession is now overstocked,) an army of 6b0,-
000 able-bodied men, who must find a market
for their surplus productions at such reduction
of price (is the want of demand will compel
them to acccpt.
From our location the repeal of duty on
Canada lumber would work a much greater
injury to us than perhaps to other sections fur-
ther west, for the reason that much of our lum-
ber finds a market through the eastern States
and Ohio, via ports on Lakes Erie and Ontario,
and comes in more direct competition. The
difference of cost ^.transportation alone js fully
equal to tho present duty in favor of Canada
lumber. The figures above represent onlythe
cost of lumber on our docks ready for shipment.
Those who ask for repeal say that it is greatly
to tho advantage of tho consumer, and claim
that by the repeal prices will be less. Yv ill the
consumer reap the benefit? I think not. It
is generally conceded that a large per cent, of
Canadian manufacturers are under the control,
if not owned by eastern capitalists, who will be
very likely to regulate retail prices at just such
rates as to keep us from the market, which, with
our disadvantage as to freight, and additional
cost ot'labor, they will not need to rcduce from
present rates to do. Assumingthis conclusion,
the Canadian manufacturers reap the benefit of
the duty rather than the American consumer;
Canadian industry is encouraged and home in-
dustry prostrated. If this showing of costs and
values is correct—and I think a more minute
calculation will show a smaller rather than a
larger profit—that with the great difference in
cost of labor and the undisputed advantage in
the single item of freight which Canadalumber
has, it is clear to any one that, with the duty,
Canada can put common grades of lumber even
into our nearest port ataless price than we can.
The object of tariff and duty on imports is
twofold, to create revenue for the support of
the Government and to protect American
industry and labor.
J. D. Ilayes, esq., in a series of papers 011
reciprocity, which were published in 1865 by
resolution of tho Buffalo, New York, Board of
Trade, makesan illusion to this question, which
I deem apropos. He says:
The lumbering interest is also a very important
ono to deal with 111 view of reciprocity. Th«t entire
Business oomes directly in contact with our own
people engaged m the same trade in a very dificrcrt
way from what it did in years before tho war. Then
both enjoyed tho same rights and privileges in our
