Report of Brigadier General Richard W. Johnson, U. S. Army, commanding Fourteenth Army Corps, of operations August 7.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 7, 1864.

GENERAL: The Fourteenth Corps gained decided advantage to-day. The charge of my old division, under King, against the enemy's works was a gallant affair; in fact, the operations of the entire corps are highly satisfactory. A portion of King's men were actually in the enemy's works, but in consequence of the entanglements few men could reach them and not in sufficient force to hold them. The lines are advanced. King is intrenched beyond the rebel skirmish line of this morning. Baird's line is in advance of its position this morning. The position of Morgan was fully explained this evening. We have lost not far from 500 men, while we have captured about 350 or 400 prisoners.
