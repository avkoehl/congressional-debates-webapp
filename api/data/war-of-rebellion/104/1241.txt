Your should be able to get information from Colonel Miles, per courier line, and must send a few scouts to watch along the Tombigbee. They will report to you regularly, sending reports by the courier-line already established. It is important we should hear from them daily, if only ot know enemy has not made his appearance on the river.

COLONEL: I send by Captain Murrell a dispatch for Surget or General Taylor, which I wish you would forward for me. There is little doubt that the enemy are in force (3,000 cavalry) at Jackson. Colonel Lankford sent a courier to turn me back. I learn Brooks is on the road west of the railroad-at all events I thinks you left flank safe. I am en route for Demopolis.
