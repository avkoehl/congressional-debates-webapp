tnought not, an 1 ihat Congress was ca1 ed upon, oy
every ucaga of legislation, by every pr nciple of
fair dealing, to appropriate the sam required Cor
the Post Offipi  Department
But then, again, it had been sa d that Conguss
ought not to próvida means to meet the debt, be-
cause it was ihe custom of the Government for the
Post Office Department to piyi'sown vay, with-
out calling on ihe Treasury fir ad This objec-
tion, howeva, was piecisely me* and p-eclnded by
thi  am; idmeot of the gen lemán frt m Virginia,
[Mr G1LM6.R,] whi"h requires this appropriation to
be charged to the Post Office Department, and de-
frayed out of i<s future earnings, or the surplus of
its past earnings whicn had heretofore been carried
to ihe credit of the Treasury.
Two gentlemen from the West [Mr Jo'insin of
Tennessee and Mr Reynolds of Illinois] had ob-
jected to the bill as impost g a tax on iheir consti-
tuents, contending that the Derailment should
stand on its own bottom, that, if it was m debt, that
debt ¡.hould be rnetb  curtailment of the mails, and
oae of them had stigmatized it as a near tariff de-
vice. Mr. C said he was surprised to hear these
suggestions, and, most of all, as coming from the
West
In th first p'ace, «uppose you undertake to cur-
tail the ma 1 as a remedy for the d ffioulty, is it
any remedy at all? Does it pay the debt? What
becomes of the contrac'or-, 10 whom the money ia
now due, dunrg the >car oi two that the cur ail-
ment goes on? It i-, obvious that they are ruined,
that they, of necessity, throw up their contract ,
that new contracts are to ue ma ie at a higher price,
snd that, by this pennv wise aiid pound foolish
policj, additional embarrassment is to be devolved
on the Department
In the second place, if you curtail, upon uhat
part of the country will the dimiauiion of mail fa-
cilities fall' You cannot dimmish the r^aiK m fie
populou? Atlantic States, or, if y< u do yea will
dimin sh the revenue ef the De anient a*, the
same time that you diminish its business, f r it s
in those Siites that the profits of the Department
are cbtamed, aid if \oü woald cur a\l tt-e mills in

Le* thee mm Ue look, for a moT tiv & the con
siderat on3 of publ c polic invol fd in th" n at¡a°e-
ment of tie Post OTice D^partme t «nd ' e whe-
ther the current ideas 01 tto u >i "' p e well
founded Why, fcr instance, should the or «rae
índiviin^U who have occisión tu coire otnd with
each oti er be sui jected to 1 heav^ lax m tke pay-
ment oí letter postage greatly exceeding (he cos of
transportation of these Is tus? W^y should
they pay this tax to the United Stat s' Why
should the old Atlantic States pay an excess of
postage on their correspondence to sus'am tve cor-
respondendence of other par's of 'he United States
Above al!, way should a poor man pay a tax, ia
thi shape of excessive postage, to convey the im-
mensj mass of the Government corresponde ice ot
the United S ates? For that is the precise fact.
Publ c documents, public correspondence, volumes
of the laws, free letters of the Executive and Le-
gislative Departments of the Government, are in
fact conveyed, not at the expense of the Treasury,
as they ought to be, but at the expense of those in
viduals who write private letters of business or
friendship And the first step in Post Office reform,
will be to charge to the Treasury of the United
States all that Government matter, printed or ma-
nuscript, which is now conveyed free of postage
And if that were done now as it justly ought to be
be, there would be no occasion f >r thu bill.
Again: Newspapers exchanged between the dif-
ferent new«paper ornees in the Uni ed States are
transported free of postage, that is to say, the busi-
ness of the newspapers, m this respect, is con-
ducted at the expense of the writer^ of letters
having no special interest in the matter Mr C.
said he did not wish to be understood as objecting to
that provision of the Post Office laws which confers
fhi4 advantage on the proprietors of new>papers.
It was conferred on them for great considerations
of public good, and for the same considerations of
public good it should be continued to them But
these considerations are considerations of public
good—1. e of benefit to the entire people of the
United States, and the entire people of the Un.ted
States should bear the burden— hat is, it should
be a 1 harge, not as it now is on individual let-
ter writers, but upon the Treasury of ine United
States
Mr C said that the committee would perceive
by this that he was in favor of diminishing the
present rate of postage on letters, fur tne two re-
forms which hthad suggested «ould a' once re-
l"v the P St Office Department from two of the
grea'est obstacles to a reduction of postyge But
11 re was one other impediment to uch a redaction
which was still more serious, vjz the false princi-
ple upon which the psstage was charged on printed
matter transposed by the public mail. The rate
of posta.e on printed matter, like that of most writ-
ten matter, was by the sheet, and a sheet of writ-
un matter pays a greatly higher postage than a
sheet of printed matter. This difference is a part
of the original idea, in p irsuance of w hich, the cir-
culation of printed matter was encouraaed at the
expen e of the writers of letters Th difference
wao 1 <m ded in sound leasons of publ <• polity, for
tae prorcoionof mtelligtncc am<n< ' e p ope.
But 'mee that t me gte?t charge:, bad incurred in

sh-et, d d nit greatly iiifer in size or i< ght from

Mr C said that he wou'd not dwe 1 fesrtner on
these ¡op c , reit-rating only his earnest hope that
the II3« e, "i P*ssi g thi-.bi'l, would testi'y i'sde-
