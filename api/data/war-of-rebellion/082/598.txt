General MEADE:

A prisoner who just came in, and whom I questioned (he has been just sent up), says there is a great movement of troops of the enemy this morning. They were drawing rations, &amp;c. He says that the troops he belongs to (B. Johnson's) mans one of those intrenchments covering the railroad, and that when he was taken there was only a skirmish line. He says many troops marched up the railroad yesterday (probably Hill), and that a great many troops have arrived within a day or two from the West or somewhere; that the ambulance train of his division went back into the intrenchments this morning.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Two soldiers from Heth's division have just come in. It holds the same position as yesterday, on the crest in my front. They deserted because they were not allowed to vote yesterday. They say that in very few cases, and those depended on the character of officers, were any allowed to vote who did not vote for Vance. These men both voted for sheriff but were not allowed to vote for governor.
