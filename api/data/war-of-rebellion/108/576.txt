If the contemplated firing should be found to interfere with the reconnaissance of the enemy's movements up the Chickahominy, it may be postponed, as the general commanding is desiorus that their reported movement should be fully discovered.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

General H. A. WISE:

GENERAL: General Lee agrees with me that the main body of yourforces ought to be at a point near enough to protect the batteries on the river, leaving the roads to be picketed by a small supporting force of infantry to the cavalry. The Yankees cavalry, whether by hundreds or thousands, can be beaten by a handful of infantry. General Rains has been sent down to add to the troubles of the gun-boats, and if time be allowed him, they may ascend, but not the river. Their directions will be perpendicular and not parallel to the noble James. I have no doubt that you will make a successful defense of your position. The troops on the central road are supposed to be in supporting distance should the enemy land in force.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
