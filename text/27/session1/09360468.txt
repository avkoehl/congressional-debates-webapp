Bankrupt Bill—Mr, Tallmadge.
H. of Reps.

shau'd submit to the w di of the majority, and go for the íehet
of üií'ividuí.fs, if CcHpjrUtons are notmcluded II will be no
satisfactoiy answei to that, large and distressed portion of the
comtnuni'y to s iy, we go against giving) «u any i elief, because
dieconsti utiona and othct se coplea of gentlemen will not pei
mi' them to hxlude corporations m the same law
Mr. President, corporations ought not to be included They
were never included in a bankrupt law in any commerc al < ora
mumt/ on the face of the eardi From the -very nature of their
creation and their being, they do not come within the íeasons
upon which a bankrupt law 19 founded The principal design
01 audi a ta v, 30 fat a3 the debtor is concerned, is—first, to re
lease the individual, if in prison, from imprisonment, second,
to discharge the obligation of his contract; third, toexempt
from execution his future acquisitions , an J to protect them for
the future sa tenanceand support of himself and family These
object* have norehtion to corporations They cannot beim
pi ¡s inert The laws of the seveial S'ates give to creditors am
pie remedies against them, and, after the application of the r
assets towards the pay men t of their debts, coi porauons ca n have
no care for the balance of an outstanding obligation t hey can
have nofutureacquisitionsor families to provide for; theiefore,
the reasons for the law, as applicable to individuals, have no ap
plication to corporations
Aside from this, 1 consider that such a law, applied to the
banking institutions of the country, would be mo^t disastious
in us consequences    It would in the first place, conflict with
the proper co itrol ol the several States over institutions of their
own creation, and undei their exclusive junsdicion    These
institutions aie deemed by many an emanation of Sta'e sove
reignty, miuy ot which are owned by the bates, and ovei
which the General Government can excise no contiol, and
wifh which it cao in no shape interfere    In the «ocond place,
ir would be putting into the hands ofcoutts and commissioners
of the Genewil Government a dangerous powei, by reason of
ihe enormous amount of the assets of oui banking institutions,
which would be subjected to such alawon the m^tantof asus*
pens'on of specie payments    The General Government can-
not manage prudently or discreetly such a fund at the arms
length distanct. at which it would be placed    It requites the
vhise inspection and near supervision of the States themselves
t) diit    They are the best jtilges of what regulations are be-t
«•lined to thou own institutions    They can best subprt thttr
courts aaa their agents to that wholesome control, so absolutely
nei-csarv to ihe pioper management and distribution of the

IHnk Commissioner, to the Chancel3oi,and by hi n  placed m
the hand-* of a teceivei, and closed up with ail convenient
speed, hiving a due iegardtothe individual and public mte-
ie->t involved in its liquidation     The States,  too, can best
judge whethei anyintetierence on their part w !!, at any time,
promote the public interests,   i here may be cases, as  theie
have been before, wheie the Legislature of a 8 a e migh  deem
U pioper to mteifere and suspend the forfeituie of a bxnk
chaiter    This occuired in 1837, after the suspension of specie
payments by the banks    The suspension was brought 01, at
thatitmp, by cuts°s beyond then   control    They suspended
loi du benefitof the community, not then own, and the Le
gisUtmts of sevetal Mates suspended the fotfeuure of thtir
1 iaitus, but did not legalize their suspension of specie pay
ments     roebin'is oí New Yorlc and elsewheie were at   ill

coercethemby prosecutions,     And why were they sustained
by public sentiment?   Why did theLegislatuie, befme the ex-
piration of ten days aftet then suspension, pass an act to re
lleve the n (torn the ioifeuuie of their chirteisi   It was be
cause the public voiu demanded it—not for the benefit of the
binks,butfoi the people themselves    Lot us suppose  that,

Sir,thi^ e;.xa session wa*-caMed for thepurp^gs of adopting
measures foi the lehef of the present distit,ssed and embar
ra^-ed co itlit o 1 of die country.    What measure would give
ereater, and more extensive, and more instantaneous reljpf than
the passage of a bankrupt law?   Thousands and thousards of
our fedow cmzer'S die reduced to aosolute want from the em
barratsmentsm which they have been involved by the state of
the times and the incubus of debt which weighs them down, and
which renders them incapable of doing any thine for their ere
d tors, for themselves, or their families    I wh'not, on this oc
casion, a!ludí  to the cau-es which brought these calamities
upon u , I entertain my ©wn views on that subject, but I will
niPtely state thatthey were beyond the control of the ordinary^
meana of prevention, and beyond the reach of the most cautious
foresight to discover    The prudent and ihe r^lde^s have bet n
overwhelmedm one common-ruin, men of ample fortunes have
been brought to poverty, md those of modeiate means to abso-
lu'e want, and the families of all looking m vain to their natu-
ral protectors for the necessaries of life    They are thrown out
of employment, and, with the worse than iron shackles which
bind them, they are incapable of earning a subsistence    There
are estimated to be m the United States 500,000 banki upts, wi h
an average of at least three person^ dependent on each, making
2,0üd,0UÜ of souls ground down to the earth by the most hope
less poveuy—their energy, their ambition, their prospects for
the present destroyed, their hopes for the future blighted   And
for whose benefit is all this misery inflicted on two mil ions
of human beings1   Isit for toe benefit of the countiyi   Does
the countiy profit by¡this paralysis of the mo&t enteiprism^,
intelligent, and  active portion  of the  community 1   Is  the
country benefitted by the prostration, nay, the almost ancihi-
lation, of the productive labor of her citizens, and by the con-
sequent debasement of morals which follows tie want of em
pioyment and the destruction of every motive to ambition?
Or is it for the benefit of the cieditor that this ruinous and
debasing s'ate of things must coitmue'í   What does he ex
pea to sam fiom al  Is the,e aiy satisfaction in holding his
dobtor m eternal bondage Í   Do^s it give him any pleasure
to behold the helpless and hopeless condition of his wife and
children?   Is there to his ear any music 111 then es foi bread
which go up from ^spmg lnfancv and totteung ago to those
who can give them no rehei?   I>ues he uerive any congola
tion from the prospect of ignoiance ándenme which aiethe
inevitaole lot of tho-e who have not the means of education
and of moial tnlfuCi   Oris there any giatihcation m contiast
ins; his own pioul elevation with the mi«eiable victim that he
histtampl d undei foot1   No, sn, no  noneofthese things    I
will not permit my «elf to believe that a credi 01 m human
s lape can enteuam stich fiend.si  feeimgs, 01 T  actuated by
such ba=ie motives     What then, is th*1 cau^e of hit, opposuion
to abankuipt liw winch shall restore once more to light and
life this ]-> t and desponding poitu n ofmu citizens?   It is the
reluctance to ctr eel anob igation, whu h is the^eomn^ rej ie
Tentative of propetty    It is the vague and undefined hope of
realizing something out of nothing, and instead of taking the
debtoi'8 estate and applying it as far as it wnl go, he holds him
in hopeless bondage till there is nothing ¡eft to apply     He can
not realize that his mteicsts are promoted by letting loose thns
laige portion of the activity, euerEy.andenterpnseof the coun-
try, he cannot perceive that he i& thereby enabling bis debtor
to become agatn one of his best customers, and to make up m
new profits, under a piosperous slate oí the country, the loss
he has sustained.   He cannot see that, by a liberal and enhght
ened policy, he may heieafter, in some instance^ itceive the
amount of principal arc! interest due him    Mr   Piesident, if
thecicditoi cannot see these things, it is high time that Con
gre-is saw tbem fir htm, and collected the  obliquity of his
vision.   Itis with some a chion¡cdisease.   The pitnulires on
this subject me of the most inveterate character    They have
boca wen tig away „uJudily but slawly from that period in
Roman   history   when thf   b > ly of ihe   debtor  was divided
ai >on¿st ¡us cifditois down to oui own time, when he was
murly put in tlosc confinement, with nothing to subsist on but
the chanty of friends, for the ¡audible purpose of enabling him
in that hopeful condition, to earn enough to pay the demand for
which he wosiiapiisoned    "Shut ou' from  ihe common au
and the com 11 on u¡>e of his own limbs," he was made to "dunk
the bileful cup of grief and  eat the bitter bieía* of rm=eiy "
lhauelicof barbarism m my own State, as well as m most
0  heis, thank God, is "expunged" irom the statute book, never
to disgrace it agn.m The same piejudices weie encounteied in
alopting the non in pn onment act in my own Stnte I was

I then ask, Mi Piesident, what moie important measuie of
relief ve have before us-* A National Bank, it is believed
would aive us a un fuim cunency, leg date the exchanges
and aid in iLMvmg the business of he country But this would
be for the benthi. of unembarrassed cieditors, and not for hone
