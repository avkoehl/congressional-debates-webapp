Enemy left Tangipahoa this morning, under Davidson, 4,000 cavalry, destination Mobile. Send all the men you can to Pollard, so that I can use Armistead to oppose them.

Brigadier-General LIDDELL,

Blakely, Ala.:

Enemy, with strong cavalry force, left Tangipahoa for Mobile this morning. I have ordered General Adams to send additional force to Pollard. Draw to vicinity of Blakely either Colonel Maury's cavalry force or that recently arrived under Armistead, whichever is nearest, so that I may be quickly re-enforced when necessary.

General F. GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

Clanton's brigade is being hurried on to Meridian. Do you want Abbay's battery now, or anything else that I can help you in?

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.

MOBILE, December 1, 1864.

General F. GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

If enemy is moving against Mobile and Ohio Railroad he will probably strike it between Bucatunna and Shubuta. Have some militia infantry sent to that vicinity. I will have McCulloch and some other cavalry in readiness. Do you wish Abbay's [battery] sent to Meridian or stopped at some point this side?

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
