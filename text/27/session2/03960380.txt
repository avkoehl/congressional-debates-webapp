the previous question.
And there was a second.
The mam question (being on the amendment)
was ordered to be now taken.
Mr. SPfUGGr a^ked the yeas and nays on he

Texas,  lit drawback stall be equally allowed as on those sent
by sea rom the Unite States into Texas
The undersigned is encoaraged to hope, fiom the truly hbe*
ral and A lend y spin so geneially manifested towards Texas
by Mr Weoster, and the Co\t,rnment of the United States that
the relief so icited so just and so essemial to the pio&penty of a
