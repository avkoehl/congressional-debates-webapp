HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, May 8, 1861.

Major-General SANDFORD, New York:

Nobody more highly estimates your value as a soldier than myself, and you will receive a hearty welcome from me. More than one brigade of your troops are here and more expected. Your right to follow them and command them is unquestionable, but your presence will be attended with one disadvantage. We are in critical circumstances, and it would take you weeks to make you as well acquainted with localities, officers, and men as Brevet Brigadier-General Mansfield, whom you would supersede as the commander of the department. Send troops by ocean and the Potomac River.
