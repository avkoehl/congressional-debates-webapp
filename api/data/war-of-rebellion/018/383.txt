HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Manassas, June 13, 1862.

Major-General BANKS, Winchester:

At the request of one of your staff, Lieutenant R. B. Brown, I telegraph you in regard to a bridge which General Meigs informed him I have with my army and which he wants at Front Royal. I have Indiarubber pontoon train at Fredericksburg, and need these to cross the Rappahannock and streams beyond. A ferry was established at Front Royal which brought men to this side-a regiment of infantry, a section of artillery, and some cavalry of General Ricketts' command.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just returned from Catlett's. The report brought there by a negro was that Richmond authorities have sent out for negroes to be sent down to work on the fortifications and for the militia to come and defend them. It was on this account the negro ran away. He overheard his master say that Jackson had passed through Charlottesville. I was unable to find the negro, and give this at second-hand.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT,Manassas, June 13, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Has the Department any information as to the position of General Fremont? I ask so as to determine in relation to moving General Shields from Luray and General Ricketts from Front Royal. I am disposed to move both of them as soon as they can march, and without waiting any further movements from General Banks.

General Banks is now in force on the Shenandoah opposite Front Royal, and even if Jackson should not have gone to Richmond, and should attempt to go again down the valley, General Banks is in the strongest position on the line for resisting him. Such a move on the part of Jackson would only result in our abandoning the line from Manassas to Front Royal. General Banks is waiting for a bridge to be built or a ferry larger that the present one to be established.
