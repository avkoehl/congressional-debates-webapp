FORT MAGRUDER, February 11, 1865-7.30 p. m.

Brigadier General JOHN W. TURNER,

Chief of Staff, Army of the James:

My picket-line was attacked this morning about 3 o'clock by about twenty-five or thirty of the rebel cavalry dressed in Union uniforms. They were driven off, with a loss on our side of 1 killed and 4 wounded; lost 5 horses, 4 captured and 1 killed. There may be a cavalry force somewhere near the Chickahominy. I have strengthened my picket-line and sent a strong force to re-enforce the reserves. I will give a good account of them if they favor me with another visit. They carried off their own wounded.

J. C. HICKS,

Major Sixteenth New York Volunteers Artillery, Commanding Post.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 11, 1865.

Major WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Norfolk:

The enemy attacked our picket-lines this morning about 3 o'clock. We lost 1 man killed, Company D, Sixteenth New York Volunteer Artillery, 3 wounded, and 4 horses. It was only a dash. I am prepared for them. I think we wounded 6 or 8 of them. I think that they were rebel cavalry, about forty or fifty, as near as it can be ascertained.

Very respectfully,

J. C. HICKS,

Major Sixteenth New York Volunteer Artillery, Commanding Post.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 11, 1865.

Commanding District of Eastern Virginia, Norfolk:

All is quiet. I have largely re-enforced the picket-lines, and have a strong force in reserve. I will give them a warm reception if they call again. I have sent a report by mail directed to Major Hoffman.

Very respectfully,

J. C. HICKS,

Major Sixteenth New York Volunteer Artillery, Commanding Post.
