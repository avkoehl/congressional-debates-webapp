THOMPSON'S STATION, November 10, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Nashville:

Since writing the former dispatch I learn that there is no telegraph station at Spring Hill, and I therefore can make nothing by moving the command there, as we are now on the turnpike and should not be when there. I will, therefore, await the wagons here. Permit me to suggest that a telegraph operator would be very useful till we get prepared for marching, and I have thought Mr. Everett might perhaps be spared while you are in Nashville.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding THIRD DIVISION.

THOMPSON'S STATION, November 10, 1864.

Captain F. G. HENTIG,

Commissary of Subsistence, Nashville:

(Care Lieutenant Colonel R. B. Treat, Commissary of Subsistence.)

Don't neglect to have rations for the command sent down to-morrow. We shall be here or at Spring Hill, there miles below.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

THOMPSON'S STATION, November 10, 1864.

Major H. W. WELLS,

Nashville.

(Care Major-General Schofield.)

Don't forget that we have not animals to move the artillery, and that we needed them before we can take the road by marching.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

THOMPSON'S STATION, November 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General REILLY,

Commanding First Brigade, Spring Hill:

SIR: The command was delayed in getting forward as I expected by a wrecked train near here. Henderson and Casement are now camped here, and will probably have to remain till some wagons come down from Nashville. If you are short of rations telegraph immediately to Captain Henting, care of Colonel Treat, Nashville, Saint Cloud Hotel, telling him him by my order to send supplies by train. I expect the road to be clear to you his evening, and will move my headquarters down in the morning so as to be near the telegraph. Let me known how you are situated.

Yours, &amp;c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
