fixed system in calling out troops. As circumstances demanded, requisitions were made upon the Governors. In many cases troops were tendered by the Governors and accepted by the United States without calls being made. Authorizations to individuals (independent acceptances) were given and many troops were brought into service in this way, without said authorization passing through the State authorities. This system of independent organization was terminated by General Orders, Numbers 18, of 1862, from this office. As a result of this want of a general system in the calling out of troops during the first year of the war it was found necessary before fixing the quotas under the calls of 1862 to determine the quotas of the respective States for 1861. This was done by considering the number of men the States had in the field. this number from the States that were to have additional quotas assigned was 548, 184, the quota of which for Massachusetts was 34,868.

Second. July 7, 1862, twelve regiments were called for from Massachusetts "as part of her quota under call for 300,000 volunteers." (See telegram, copy herewith, marked A.*) August 26, 1862, the Governor has notified that the quota of 300,000 volunteers was 19,000. (See telegram B, herewith.+) The State was therefore duly notified that 19,080 was the quota assigned her. Exhibit C, herewith, will show the number of troops not embraced in the statement of May 19. Should these troops be credited to the State, then her deficiency by the records of this office to date would be 6,301-4,169=2,132.
