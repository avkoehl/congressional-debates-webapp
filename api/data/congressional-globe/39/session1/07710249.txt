Protection of American Labor—Mr. Davis.
Ho. of-Reps.
Carrying backward the rates of comparative
increase, assigned "by this table, to 1776, it will
appear probable that then the population of
the colonies did not much, if any, exceed
2,800,000, being about three and a half tim.es
less than the population of Great Britain;
while a similar calculation will show that the
real and personal property was about twelve
times greater than that of the colonies. The
area of the United Kingdom was 120,851 square
miles. That of the United Colonies was 820,680
square miles. England had been cultivated for
centuries. *
It was estimated by Arthur Young, after long
investigation and travel, in 1780, that the cap-
ital employed in agriculture in England and
Wales was then £128,000,000—$640,000,000,
being a greater value than all the real and per-
sonal property of the United Colonies at the
same period.
While, therefore, agriculture was highly de-
veloped, while wealth per capita was nearly
three times greater in England than with us;
while the steam-engine, the spinning-jenny,
and the power-loom were all held under the
restriction of English patents; and while the
policy of England forbade either the export
of machinery or the migration of the ma-
chinist ; while labor was low in an old country
and high in a new one, the young republic
entered the lists with England as a competitor
for the supply of American markets by Amer-
ican productions. In this contest we have
ever felt the power, not only of English capi-
tal, but of English ideas, and in deference to
British sentiment we have too often ignored
the logic of undisputed facts. _ I shall now in-
vite the attention of the committee to the con-
sideration ofthenecessaryresults of themarked
differences in culture and material wealth to
which I have alluded.
The various acts of Parliament restraining
manufactures in the colonies had for their pur-
pose and end the monopoly of the sales to the
colonists of the home manufactures of England.
The spirit and temper of the nation were illus-
trated' by an English writer in 1750, Mr. Gee,
who, in speaking of "manufactures in our
American colonies," says:
"Thev should not only bo discouraged but prohib-
ited. IVe ought always to keep a watchful eyo over
our colonies to restrain them from setting up any of
the manufactures which arc carried on in Great Brit-
ain ; and any such attempts should be crushed 111 the
beginning."
The reason is obvious, and one of the causes
of revolution was the persistent and oppressive
effort of England to prevent the introduction
and prosperity of manufactures beyond the
Atlantic in our colonies.
I appeal to distance instead of years; and I
ask not the history of a century ago. I ask
the present, on our western frontiers, what are
the rates of interest which money there com-
mands in this our day? I think I may say from
personal knowledge that in Iowa, even in Illi-
nois, in Minnesota, in Nebraska, and in Mis-
souri, the average interest of money is more
than ten per cent, per annum. In several
States this rate is permitted by contract, and
in all it is recognized by necessity. This is
the concurrent history of settlement in all new
countries, and this rate is lower than the aver-
age interest in California, Oregon, Idaho, and
Nevada; and yet in our colonial days money
was far scarcer than now.
Adam Smith, writing just before our inde-
pendence, says, (chapter three, book five, of his
Wealth of Nations:)
" The Americans, indeed, have no gold or silver,
the interior commerce of the country being carried
on by a paper currency, and the gold and silver which
occasionally come among them being all sent to Great
Britain in return for the commodities which tlicy
receive from us."
It is a fact which all history will verify, that
our colonial Legislatures, to remedy the scarcity
of currency, resorted to issues of paper money
as a legal tender till prohibited by imperial
legislation.
On the other hand, money was abundant in
England, and scarcely exceeded five per cent,
per annum, until the terrible tornado which
prostrated the Bourbon dynasty swept Austria,
Prussia, Russia, and England into the vortex
of its revolution. Nor during the fiery ordeal
through which England passed in the years of
the Revolution and the Empire, when all Eu-
rope,, combined against France, was subsidized
by British gold, did the rate of interest in Eng-
land reach so high a point as that paid by the
people of the United States during the war of
the rebellion.
Four centuries of gradual growth of agri-
culture and manufactures under rigorous pro-
tection, had given to England, at the date of
our independence, rank as a leading Power of
Europe. Robert Clive had recently laid the
foundations of British empire in India on the
bloody field of Plassey. Hastings, by his reck-
less daring and address, enlarged the fabric
and made England sovereign over a hundred
million Asiatics. The fabulous wealth of Ben-
gaj, Oude, and Bahar was transferred from
India to London. The fabrics of England
found a new and profitable market on the
Hoogly and the Ganges.
The first Congress which assembled after the
adoption of the Constitution took into earnest
consideration the subject of domestic manufac-
tures and the revenue to be derived from their
protection.
But the country -was impoverished; the
financial ruin brought on by the absolute anni-
hilation of the continental currency had not
been retrieved. Capital for any extensive sys-
tem of manufactures was unattainable; and in
the absence of domestic production foreign sup-
ply was indispensable. Moreover, a defense-
less sea-coast stretched along thousands of
miles of unsettled country. The St. Lawrence,
under the control of Britain, left a commercial
avenue to the lakes; the Mississippi opened
access to our western frontiers; and there was
scarcely a spot from Georgia to New Hamp-
shire where the smuggler would not prosecute
his craft, under a system of high duties, with
profit and safety. The tariff of 1780, 1790,
1791, 1792, 1794, 1795, 1796, and 1797 did
something, but not much, to relieve us from
the power of British competition, and Eng-
land readily secured to itself the cotton manu-
facture in which we had not the capital to
embark.
The war of 1812 made emancipation a neces-
sity, and the tariff of 1816-17 was designed to
give appropriate encouragement to American
production.
From the adoption of the Constitution up to
the war of 1812 the value of real and personal
estate of the United States had only risen to
about $1,500,000,000, while that of Great Brit-
ain stood at §10,212,800,000. The value of
our annual production was §420,000,000, in-
cluding cotton exports of about S47,000,000
per annum. Hers was 81,531,845,000.
New England, now the seat of factories and
machine-shops comparing favorably with those
of Europe, turned her enterprise to the fisher-
ies and commerce. We had no YV est. The
coal-fields of Pennsylvania were unworked.
Her iron ores were unheeded or unknown.
The system of labor in the southern slavehold-
ing States was believed, at least by its advo-
cates, to be ill adapted to mechanical labor or
manufactures. The result was natural, per-
haps inevitable. So long as English capital
and sagacity were aided by onr own depend-
ence and prejudices in the control of our pro-
ductions and markets, we sent our cotton to
England, paid freight, an import duty there,
varying from 6.9. 6(7. sterling per hundred
pounds in 1798, 7s. lOd. in 1802, 16s. 11 d. in
1809, us. IQd. in 1831, to 2s. lid. in 1833, and
when the raw material had been spun by Brit-
ish jennies and woven by British looms, we
kindly bought the fabric, paid return freight,
a new import duty to our own Government,
and rejoiced that we were a great and a wise
people.
New England preferred commerce to manu-
factures, and her influence unfortunately was
not lent to protection, because her interest did
not dictate it.
But let us look at the wakeful sagacity of
England, while the commercial interests of
New England and the North discarded man-
ufactures—or at least failed to encourage
them—and while the South, blind to the evils
of servile labor, neglected to initiate a sys-
tem of manufactures for the staples which she
raised.

crease of the import of cotton-wool for the

I have not at hand the actual amount im*
ported in the five years succecding, but the
value of import is as follows:
186 0 £35,750,859
186 1  38,653,393
1862   31,(193,035
186 3  56,277,953
186 4  78,203,729
From 1861 to 1864 the import from the Uni-
ted States was reduced to a nominal amount
by the war, and thus the price of cotton rose
more than ten hundred per cent.
Our export of cotton, from its small begin-
ning, for years has exceeded a thousand million
pounds, and yet in 1857, when our total pro-
duction was 3,118,962 bales, we manufactured
within the United States but about 600,000
bales, furnishing to England nearly the entire
residue of 2,500,000 bales to support her labor^
in competition with onr own.
If we turn now to the Census of 1860, under
the head of manufactures, we shall find in the
introduction, page 20, that from 1821 to 1839,
inclusive, the manufactured cottons imported
amounted annually to $14,624,687 ; from 1840
to 1856 the average was §16,795,418, and for
the last three of those years it was an average
of §28,811,966. In 1860 we received of plain
cottons from Britain alone 226,766,939 yards,
of the declared value of §8,849,915, besides
the other fabrics of the same material which
we imported, because we were not wise enough
to make them.
In 1856, it appears by statistics furnished by
the reports of an official character in Great
Britain, that there-were then in operation in
spinning and weaving cotton, wool, flax, and
silk, 5,117 factories, using the power of 161,435
horses, 33,503,580 spindles, 367,208 power-
looms, 682,497 hands.
Of these factories 2.210, employing 28,010,217
spindles and 379,213 hands, were employed m
the spinning and weaving of cotton alone, while
887,369 persons were engaged in the prepara-
tion, dyeing, and printing of these fabrics and
upon other textile fabrics of the kingdom.
It was estimated that the entire aggregate
of persons, 1,560,856, thus employed sustained
an additional population of 3,000,000 who were
dependent on their labor, making about one
eighth of the population at that time. But what
becomes of this vast manufacture, which in a
century has grown from nothingness to impe-
rial importance? ^ou find tho answer by ex-
amining the export of manufactures.
In 1834 Great Britain manufactured of raw
material 802,935,657 pounds, making the prod
