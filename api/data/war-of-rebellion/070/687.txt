CUMBERLAND, June 28, 1864

Major MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

Your telegram received. The scouts shall be sent out as you desire. I had already sent a scout of State troops, or, as the rebels call them, "Swamp Dragons," via the mouth of Seneca, to Crab Bottom and Monterey. Expect to hear from them soon. There are a great number of dismounted rebels home after horses in the counties of Hardy, Hampshire, Pendleton, and Highland. Mail carrier was attacked this a.m. by some of these dismounted rascals between Greenland Gap and New Creek. Unfortunately, McNeill will be enabled to mount and equip 100 of them from his late captures.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, June 28, 1864-6 p.m.

Major MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

Please inform General Stahel that a small squad of mounted rebels were in Bath, Morgan County, this a.m. Retreated without doing any damage.

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, June 28, 1864.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

Yours of yesterday duly received. The information this a.m. is that General Hunter's forces are at or near Lewisburg. If this is so, we will in all probability be relieved from the danger of any formidable raid into the northwest portion of our State at present. McNeill surprised and captured a detachment of the Sixth Virginia Cavalry at Springfield, in Hampshire County, yesterday; captured about 60 men, horses, and equipments.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
