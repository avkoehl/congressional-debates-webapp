HDQRS. SEVENTH DIVISION, ARMY OF THE OHIO,Cumberland Ford, May 3, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My scouts will be engaged on both sides of the Cumberland Mountains at the same time. Heavy fogs, which sometimes last half a day, render signals useless. I want sent to Quartermaster Brown, at Lexington, 30 miles of telegraph field cordage, with reel, to be there by the 8th instant. I can have a special messenger at that place to receive it. Can I have it?

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A contraband has just come in from the Gap. He reports the strength of the enemy at 5,500, and that in the affair of Monday Captain Phelps, of the Third Georgia Battalion (whose servant he was), and 5 privates were killed; also that he saw 8 wounded men. He says that 6 soldiers deserted with him, but on passing the enemy's pickets they were fired upon and scattered, and he alone succeeded in getting in. No news of Humphrey Marshall.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General Volunteers, Commanding.

GEORGE'S HOUSE,

May 4, 1862.

General HALLECK:

The reconnaissances toward Farmington found the bridge over Chambers Creek destroyed about 5 miles this side of Farmington. Road very bad through the creek bottom, requiring to be corduroyed. Enemy's pickets at Chambers Creek. They were on the same creek on the Corinth road yesterday. The reconnaissance on that road to-day has not yet returned.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Farmington, May 4, 1862.

Major General HALLECK:

My command has advanced and occupies strong position 1 1/2 miles this side of Farmington, with bad creek in front and an impenetrable jungle and swamp on our left. Enemy has massed considerable force on railroad south of Farmington, evidently fearful of our crossing Memphis and Charleston and intercepting Mobile and Ohio Railroad.
