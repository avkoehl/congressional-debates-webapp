Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I have deserters here from Pickett, Field, and Kershaw. Pickett's brigades lie between the James and the Appomattox. Kershaw relieved Hoke when he left, and Field is also on north side of James. If you want to know anything about those divisions write me. Did you get a telegram from me this a.m., and can you answer the questions proposed?

SHARPE,

Colonel.
