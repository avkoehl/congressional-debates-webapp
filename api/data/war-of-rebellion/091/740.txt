(Received 9 p. m.)

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Kernstown, Va.:

Do you think it possible now to send cavalry through to the Virginia Central road? It is highly desirable that it be done, if it is possible. I leave the practicability of this to be determined by you.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

KERNSTOWN, VA., December 4, 1864-12 noon.

(Received 12.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have made every endeavor to discover if any of the enemy's forces have left the Valley except Kershaw's division, and have failed, from which I conclude that none have left except that division. I would like to retain Getty's division for a few days. When the Sixth Corps all leaves me I will not have more than 10,000 infantry line-of-battle men.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 4, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Kernstown, Va.:

You will fix your own time about the movement of Getty's division. Please telegraph to General Wright what you determine, in order that he may regulate his movements accordingly.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
