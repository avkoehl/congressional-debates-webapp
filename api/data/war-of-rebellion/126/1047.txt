General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual returns of the Army.

MUSTERING AND DISBURSING FOR VOLUNTEERS.

The last annual report brought down the operations of the department, in mustering out the Volunteer Army, to November 1, 1866, at which date 1,023,021 volunteers had been discharged, leaving in service 11,043.

Of that number the following have since been mustered out:

U. S. Colored Troops................... 8,756

Perfected returns...................... 1,303

Oregon Volunteers...................... 65

New Mexican Volunteers................. 405

Officers of the general staff.......... 168

Officers of the Veteran Reserve Corps.. 143

Thus leaving in service 203 commissioned officers and no enlisted men.*

Mustering and disbursing offices have been discontinued as rapidly as the public interest would permit. At the date of the last annual report there were eighteen offices, each under the charge of a commissioned officer. Of this number all have been closed except the following: At Albany, N. Y., for New York State; at Philadelphia, for Pennsylvania and New Jersey; at Columbus, Ohio, for Ohio and West Virginia.

The records of the offices closed have been transferred to this city, except those at Louisville, Ky., for Kentucky and Tennessee; at Saint Louis, Mo., for Missouri, Kansas, Dakota, Colorado, and Nebraska; at Santa Fe, N. Nex., for New Mexico; at San Francisco, Cal., for California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Territory; at which places, in consequence of the peculiar character of the business, they remain connected with military division or department headquarters.

No appropriation of money will be required for the volunteer disbursing branch during the next fiscal year.

COLORED TROOPS.

All the colored volunteers remaining in service at the date of the last report have been must twelve commissioned officers, retained on duty in the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.
