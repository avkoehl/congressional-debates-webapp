service than in his present position. Such change for him is therefore respectfully recommended.

Of the majors, Brockenbrough, entitled to praise for extended and good service, is disabled, and will probably long so continue, by the lingering effects of a wound received at Fredericksburg last December. He ought to be relieved of responsible connection with this army and assigned some post of comparatively light duty.

To fill the vancies thus occurring and others now existing, I respectfully recomend, on the testimonials of other commanders, as well as on my own judgmet, the following promotions, viz:

Colonel E. P. Alexander, to be brigadier-general and chief of artillery, First Corps; Lieutenant-Colonels Carter, Jones, and Cutts, to be colonels; Majors Dearing, Eshleman, Huger, Braxton, Pegram, McIntosh, Poague, Beckham, Hardway, and Richardson, to be lieutenant-colonels, and Captains Cutshaw, Jordan, Miller, Strinbling, Raine, R. C. M. Page, Watson, McGraw, M. Johnson, Ward, Maunrin, Moorman, Chew, and Breathed, to be majors.
