saying that 1 áo not suppose it possih'e to dispense with banks
or paper money. My principle is to ovtend and s rengthcn the
basis of specie, and to nuke banks subject to the laws of the
land These mints will probably have a good eflVct is sup
plymgr us with good currency^and it is ano her argument in
their tavor
Mi UNDERWOOD hoped this debite would now terminate,
but he wfahed to make one suggestion, which was  that, in case
the mints should be abol lined, the salaries of the oflu ers would
s> ill be authorized hy law     Now, 11 they intended 10 legislate
on these mints, they ought also, at the same time, to legislate on
all the various interests connected with then     li releienrel)
these mints, he would say that, if the question v. is now whe
ther tl ey should be created, he might perhaps oppose them
or if the question was in a proper form before them to repeal
the law under which thej had been created, he might be m favor
of doing away with them all, except one great national mint
Hut that could not be effected in the manner piopo=eri, and if
the amendment should prevail, the loss to Government would
be greatet lhan the amount proposed to be appropri t>ed
Mr McKAY hoped this debate would speedily be brouoht to
a close, and, as he did not wish to add ai v thing to the delay,
he would make but a few brief remarks, in addition to what had
already been ad\anced, in de'ence of these branch m n'e
The Constitution gave to Congress the txclusive power to
coinmone\, therefor , it was the chit) of Congress to provide
the means by which this was to be effected
For many years, there had been but one mint, located at Phila
delphia; but, iwoyearsago, Congress anpropnated money for
the erection of these additional one- Now, every body knew
that these mints in the Smth were in themidotol a tommy
wlierethe gold was procured and Government was bound to
afford every facility to the people ol those parts ol the country
for converting thu go'd into coin Tneufore, it wis nothing
but right that these branch mini3 should be located in a sol 1
country So faT as the operations of these mints v ere con
cerned, a very considerable amount of coinage halaheady been
executed.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr Ocle] had on
yesterday objected to them, on the ground i f expense Why,
upon the same principle they might contend for the abolition
ofall the dis ncteourts ofthe l mted btates They mietit con
tend that all theso branch courts should be abo'i-died, and one
great court erected in their stead to which t1 e feople would
hive to travel from all parts ofthe Union, in order to jet jus'ice
This was a case precisely in point The camepri'iciple would
also apply to our navy yards throughout ilie country and if
there was any fmce in the argüir ent ihat these mints «houl I te
abolished ol the grounJ of expense, then all the mvy vauls
except one should be abolished also, for it would he cena nly
much less expense lo have one great navy yinl instead of
several. But every reasonable person would anmit that it
was necessary for Government 10 siudy co iv enience, as w ell as
expense.
In relation to the purchase of tree* by the superintendent of
the mint at North Carolina, it occutiedtohimihat sums fora
similar obiect had been expended by other officers of Govern-
ment in adorning our pubhc places He believed n anv cases
could be refeired to, where an expenuiture had Leen made
for ornamenting our public buildings, by the p anting of
trees.
He hoped the motion to str ke out the item for these mints
would be withdrawn, and that they wou d be all iwed a fur
trial. Admitting that the expense should exceed the returns,
yet ihat was no good reason (or iheir disconi inuaticc, as it was the
duty of Government, in the exereise of ns constitutional prero
gative of coinage, to keep up those estabiiehments at points
most convenient for ihe people.
Mr MONTGOMERY feltbjundtp mike a few lemarts in
re'ai on to these branch mints He ui'ild notieprees I is *ui
prise that whenevei any appropriation came up for institutions
in the South,theie weie found g nilemen on 'hat 11 >or who
would mvar.abiy rise in opposition to it. It woii'd appeal
from the remarks ol some, that they were to have evtry thing
in the North, and nothing in the South He regretted, how
ever, that this important appropriation bill shoullbe tkliycd
by a, dtscuss'on of that nature, and as he vv a  anxious to de dy
lias little as possible, he would make his rtmirlis veiy brief
His colleague had spoken m reí rence toan accou I paid by
iheSeeretatyof the Treasury to Mi Wuehr, ofthe Norw
Carolina mint Now he would admit that it was a verytxlia-
ordinary account, yet he did not know of tmy'leder iei-on to
examine into that account thin hN tolleagi,e It w u'dseiie
his colleague very well lorelectioni ern g puipo^-b ai c' he wis
)«rfecily willing lint he shou d have fie lull brunt oi it
There was nodou'it but that he w mi d nial'e sun1 vuy hand
some political capital out ol those trees and fl >wrr girdeus
He was surprised, how ev et, at the accoui t ^e had litiiu, as, un
til then, he had al wats understood Mi Whet cr to be a v ry
plain man He would repeat that he km.w nothing about this
fljiver garden, hut he wassuie tl at if Mr \\ heeler ft t in o the
hands of his colleague, he wouM gel ample jtt-4 red >re ' m
If there was any man who could do |iWKf in such matie s i
was his colleague as he believed fiat gentleman hail tpoken
more afihe extravagince of this Adi un mi.u i n than an\ other
gentleman upon that floor.
Bu' there was one fivor whti he had to ,s' of his col-
league It was this he honed tint when I e pub ís'ie I ihK i x-
traordinary account ol ihe flower caiden he w nil I al->o pub
lish, and a'tach to the account fie fict that he [Mi Mtuv]
htmselfAorf voted for /A  money i.''iícA paid fa it
This Administration was charged  with all ihe extravagant
expenditures. Now he would beg to say, that during the Twenty -
fifth Congress, at least, the Administration were less guilty th^n
the Opposition    He could p ove that fict, is he hid done be
fore, by a reference to the journal, yes, during t'iat Congress,
the Whigs, with the aid of the Conservatives hada miprity
here, and it was a notorious fact, that the greatest Government
ap?ro iría' ois that were ever made weren ade du t ng the period,
when the Opposition themselves had the mat ri'y and could,
with their majority, have contiolle 1 them    lie knew \ ery well
that few of those gentlemen were w lling to aJmit tl o la t but
it could be found from an indispu'able authority, tl e journal
of the House, which shows that over seventy five mil'ions were
appropriated during that Congress, and that the Whigs and
Opposition members have  fewfr votes recorded against this
unprecedented amount than the Administration members see
the journal where the votes are recorded
Mr M was here called to order by several gent'emen for irre
lerancy. After some dispute on that point, he said as he did
poldenre to wound the feelings of those sensitive gentlemen,
or to make them unhappy by a reference to their votes at this
tune, he would say no more on that matter lie would repeat,
however, that if every institution ol tho ¡south was to be put
down on the ground of expense, the South had very little to
expect
He did not blame the Northern members so much, ss peihaps
sutb opposition might be expected from them bv their coristi
tuents,  far  umove'   from  the   place   of  expenditure,  and
foimed a part of their duty    But he was surprt ed to hear of
opposition   lorn   Southern men      He  regrette I   that  such
a    proposition   had    been   supported   by   any   gentleman
from the South    They had natural  resomrtj in the Smith,
and when  they were   attenuating   to  bring  them into ope
ration this opposition arose fiom gentlemen whose interest it
was to support rather than oppose them, and mould onlyatise
fiom po'mcal party feelings       It was more aimed at men
than at measures, and could be made here to manufacture
political capital   for the vote taken upon the motion to abo
lish, showed that they did not calculate on success    Let men
have all they can mike out of it    1 hey required a sound con
stmitional < urrency, a circulaung medium, in accordance with
tie requisition of the Consti ution     But whatdil gentlemen
say heie? Why, that they should nothave ihe means ol carrying
it mtoeffct
In his district they had one bank, which had almtit a half
mil ii m of specie locked up, so that the people could not touch
a dollar, nor didthey know how to get it, for thu banks refused
to pay any body, and made e\ery body pay them Would mm
—yes, sir, men of family submit to such tyranny without a
strugcle'' Ves, these bank men bought up the specie with
their depreciated bank paper, and then blamed the Admini
nistra ion for it 1 hey first drained the people of their hard
money, and then turned round and cmsed the Administra
lion for the effects of their own diabolical paper system It
was a notoiious fact, that in one single day that bank bought
up a half million of dollars in specie, and put afloat their
woithless paper in its s ead Ihey were told by the bank
men that they should have nothing but a paper currency
But if those paper tyrants thought they could oppress the
people of ihe South, they would find themselves n isiaken The
people of the South were yet free, and he thanked God that
oppression was only known, as yet, in the Fastein States It
mi. lit suit ihe bank men very well to compel the leopleof the
East to take their worthless paper, but that would not do in
tl e South
Instead of reinj tyrannized over by these bank", he was in
favor of these branch mints, from which we c luid get a coristi
tutional currency, instead of worthiest paper, and he wonldtcll
them that the day was not veiy far distant when no portion of
the pei pie would submit to the oppression anv longer 1 hey
would not long submit to have their bullion taken and locked
up in the banks
He wou'd not say that his colleague wasa bank man, although
it so happened that all the friends of the gentleman were en
gaged with the biuks Now there was one singular lactlo which
he wished to call the attention of the committee and the coun
try. It was, that these very men who were now opposing the
branch mints, to stop the coinage of good money, did, on a for-
mer occasion, vote against a pi opo«ition to compel the banks
to keep in their vaul s one dollar for every thiee dollars of
paper Yes, he wou d go furthei,andKay thatthete men voted
¡ignnst a proposition lor compelling the banks to keep one
dollar of specie for every five dollars in liabilities He had the
proof of a'l the ficts befoie him, page and vote maiked, but
as he did not wish to delay the passage ofthe bill, he would
not trespass fuiiher on the time of the rcmniittee, in relation to
that matter, but would, should his remarks be published, give
the vo'e upon Ihat subject He wou! I cm ent himself by
saying that he was prepaied to prove all he had asserted at d a
great deal more be3 des, upon these modern Bank Federal
Wh gs He had the material all ready, and would uee it the first
opportunity that offered.
If the "e branch mints were put down, it would be doir-g great
l justice to'hepeop'e of tin South, and p'aymg mto the hands
n the Bank Federal party there, who hate gol landsilvei—who
surreptitinaslv obtain it, and then lockitup and refuse to pay
the honest poor man for a five dollar bill of their ow n money,
w Inch he has liboied hard for, but compel hun to go to one of
their agents and have it shaved for good money, and that, too,
with their own money, and then curse Van Buren and his party

In relation to the motion to strikeout the item for the expen-
ses of these branch mints, it appeared to him a veiy different
question to the question as to whether these institutions should
or should not le continued in existence The latter question
depended on the law establishing the mints, 1 ut so long as that
law" was in force,it was evidently our duty to make the neces
sary appropriation for carrying them on The question of
abolishing them was an entirely independent question, there
fore so long as the law was in force, re shou'd be disposed to
vote for the appropriation to defray the current expenditures
Then the question as to whether they ought or ought not to
he continued, would furnish matter for an after consideration
In relation to the alleged abusesyeferred to by the gentlen-an
from North Carolina, it reminded him of the stmng position
taken by his colleague (Mr Adams] the other day That gen
tleman had said, if the Committee on Public Expenditures
would investigate all such cases of alleged fraud, and have
their repoit ready at the time the appropriation bills were
brought up, some millions ofthe public money might be saved
Mr JOHNSON of Maryland said he wished to submit an
amendment to suspend the salaries as a modification of his first
proposition, and inquired of the Chair whether it would be in
order.
The CIIAIR said it would be in order to make an appropna.
tion sul iect to a certain contingency
Mi JOHNSON (hen offered the lollowing as a modification
of his original motion to strike out, viz
'•And that the said salaries shall cease atthe expiration of ihe
current year, and that at the expiration ot said period, the es.
(ablishments In Georgia, North Caiohna, andJLouisiana, shall
be suspended until otherwise directed by law "
Mr CUSH1NG salt that, under the existing laws, the Prefi
dent, Secretary, and other officers, are entitled to certain sala
ríes Ihe law¿lhat creates those nfhcers,contlnues them at those
fixed salaries 1 herefore if you strike out the appropi lation in
thisb II, it (ill not rejieal theliw allowing the talary These
officers will be still ei titled Ey refusing to apirornate would
notaflect their nghtto it, but the Government would be still
indebted to them
Mi JOHNSON of Maryland said Ihe power which created the
law could destroy it, either in a separate bill, or as a section in
another bill The precise time or manner was unimportant
With that view he pioposed Ihe amendment
The CHAIR decided that the amendment was out of order
This was a hill making appropriation for ihe euirent expen
ses of the Government, to provide that for which the existing
Mr JOHNSON said he differed with the Chair, yet he did
not wish to take an appeal He was not responsible for the de
bate which had taken place on the amendment He made the
motion without a word of comment, and took his seat tne
friends of the Administration weie responsible In relation In
the astonishment expressed, that a Souihern man should have
made a motion to reduce an institution located in a Southern
Stale, could not influence his action The doctrine of Southsrn
interest was no doctrine to operate or influence him it was
useless to rise with such arguments to influence him 'I he same
arguments and reasons that would induce mm to vote for a
measure in Georgia, would govern his actions for like mea
sures in North Carolina He bel eved it was a useless expel •
diture of money, and he was astonished that it was defended on
no other ground lhan ihat it was located in the Staic of Geoigia
All these appeals had no mflui nee Though he was a Southern
man, he wou'd only go with the South when it was in favor of
the prosperity of the whole Union He was always opposed to
piodigil expenditure of moncv, without regard to tbe particular
section of country it was proposed to benefit If such an argu
ment should obtain, it would be a most potential argument to
bung about what these ^outht rn gentlemen so much deprecate,
a protective tautT He then went into an argument toshow
that the destruction of ihe mint would not oper ite to the iniurv
ol the gold findeis, or the laborers etuigid in Ihe mines in the
district of country in which it was located, even it it diddnve
them to the necessity ot disposing of the resu't of their labors to
the speculatois, of which the gentleman had complaint d The
whole operandi ot the brant It mints was a drain on the Trea
sury, and resulted to individual, instead ofnatioral advantage
He was willing to show his regard to the interests of ihe S. uih,
by voting for something that was useful to the*?ouih These
mints were not He was opposed tothe cieat on of these insu
Pmons in the first place \\ hen the whole facts of the case
should be known to the pub'ic, he did not believe any Adminis-
tration could be sustained that would support them Mr J
concluded by withdrawing his modification, and let the original
amendment stand
Mr UROMGOOLE dissented from this indirect mode of re-
pea'ing a law of the land \V hy dl 1 not those gentlemen who
were opposed lo there institutions come forward m the early
port of the session—after a discussion of this subject for two
years—and propose a bill to repeal, in a proper manner, the
law authonz ng these institutions, if they were deemed unrie-
ceecary^
Mr OGLE said he had, in the eailv part of iIip session, intro-
duced a rtsolniinn ci ling upon the Department for informa-
tion, with a view of bringing forward a bil, but the House had
voted it oown
Mr D resumed, and said that was the regular mode of d. -
ing the business, and it was evidently a test of the sense of the
House, of its determination not to repeal the 1-w and now it
was proposed to do that indnectly which the House refused to
do directly He did not deny that it was within the power ot
Congress to withhold an appropriation He would ask gentle-
men whtther it would be right in Congiess to withhold from
membeisof Congiessthe amount of pay to which they were
entitled under an existing law of-the land If it were withheld,
he had no doubt that thev would soon go home He would ask
those gentlemen who made so much clamor about economy,
whether this measure now proposed was Sow  fide economy.
What, he asked, would become of the public property? Do
gentlemen suppose that, if ihe salaties of Ihe < ffirers be wi'h-
held, they will not actas we would act, and abandon their sta-
ll ins?
If this appropriation be withheld, it would be tantamount to
the abandonment oC property that cost the Government half a
million of money; leave it to go to destruction, to save a few
thousands This would be, indeed, a beautiful system of eco-
nomy We had the right to refuse to appropriate to fulfil ex-
isting laws, but he would ask gentlemen, did rot ting amend
ment repeal tbe law, wh cb the House refused directly to do1
He put it lo genllerren, whether it formed a proper precedent
in leg slation whether it wa proj er to do that indirectly which
the House refused to do direrily, an I thus delay an appropna
tion bill, and do manliest íniustice to those who were in Hie
employ of the Government, and who were now suffering Who
would ever think of looking nro an appropriation bill to ascer-
tain (he dutus of the officer^ of ihe mints, or fo ascertain
whetler the law, establishing the mints, was repealed'' Con-
gress could not, with justice, withhold ihe appropriation.
Mr STAN1 Y made some further remarks here
Mr JONES was sorry to trouble the committee with any
further remaiki on this subject, nor wou'd he have done it, bat
for certain statements intrrdured by the gt ntleman from North
Carolina, [Ml Stanly,] which had been taiten hold of by other
gentlemen, and converted into a charge agamst the Adminis-
tration
It might heconsidered by the committee that it was his duty,
as chairman ofthe Committee of Ways and Means, to have ex-
amined this matter, but it would be obvious to all, that these
rharges referred to transactions more lhan two years ago
Notwithstanding, had he been aware that the charges would be
made, he should certainly have turned his attention to tbe
matter.
The gentlemrn from North Carolina han" selected these
charges liom a vast number of items.    Be had brought them
