Send word to the officer in command of the fifty men that went down the river last night to report at once if anything of importance has occurred since his last report, and to endeavor to ascertain the whereabouts of this regiment (Ninety-first Illinois) [Indiana] at once, either by sending a scout or going with his whole force to or near to Williamsport, and report in regard to this as soon as he can learn. Direct him further to watch the river closely from Hamilton's Ford down to Williamsport and report any movement of the enemy immediately by courier.

Colonel CAPRON,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: General Johnson directs that you detail a reliable and energetic officer with a party of fifteen men to scout up Duck River, on the south bank, as far as Berlin, inquire for the enemy, and the condition of the fords, whether passable or not. The object of the scout is to ascertain whether the enemy is moving any troops to the east of this place to cross Duck River above this. If any are heard of all possible information must be obtained of their number, character, and purposes. Send with this officer all the guides you have. He is to communicate any information at once, by courier; or if necessary in his judgment, will return himself, with his party, to bring it; if nothing is heard before that, he will go on to Shelbyville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
