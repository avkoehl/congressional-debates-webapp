master is authorised to retain out of the wages
of such seamen ; and if the master of any re-
gistered, enrolled, or licensed vessel of the
United States shall render a false account of

That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby au-
thorised to appoint a surgeon to act w supervising
surgeon of marine hospital service, whose duty it
shall be, under the direction of the Secretary, to
supervise all matters connected with the marine
hospital service, and with the disbursement of the
fund provided by this act, at a salary not exceeding
the rate of $2,000 per annum, and his necessary
traveling expenses, who shall be required to make
monthly reports to the Secretary of the Treasury.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I desire to inquire how
this bill changes the present law. I have not
looked into it. Does it increase the amount
of monthly contribution by sailors to the hos-
pital fund ?
Mr. CHANDLER. I will answer in brief
that it makes the marine hospital service a
separate thing and saves the Treasury about
one hundred and eight thousand dollars a year.
If the Senator desires it the report of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury on the subject can be
read.
Mv. TRUMBULL. I would like to inquire
what is the amount fixed. Is it fifty cents a
month?
Mr. CHANDLER. Sixty, I think; but the
report will show.
Mr. HOWE. Let us have the report read.
Mr. CHANDLER. Very well; I send it to
tho clcslc
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Treasury Department,
January 26, 1870.
Sir : I herewith submit respectfully a bill for the
organisation of the marine hospital servioe, to-
gether with suoh facts as are at the command of the
Department relating to the suhieot.
It will appear from the suhjoined table showing
tho total amount of reoeipts and expenditures for
six years that the estimated defioitexhibited for the
present fiscal year is greater than thatshown in pre-
vious years. This arises mainly from the faet that
the appropriations for the years 18(38-69 and 1869-70
have been in the former year only one half, and in
the latter only one third of tho estimates submitted.
The defleit of this year, therefore, exhibits aa
accumulated one of two years in consequence of inad-
eauate appropriations.
The following table presents the important facts
of the case:

During the year ending June 30, 1860, there was
received from hospital tax on seamen the sum
of.   $174,96595
During the same period there was ex-
pended for care of sick and disabled
seamen  418,602 37
Excess of expenditure over tax re-
ceived  243,63642
But during this period the scale of relief was
insufficient and the seamen had just cause of com-
plaint. When a seaman has canccr, consumption,
or other incurable disease, no relief is given under
existing laws and regulations.
Moreover, the marine hospitals of the first class,
through a mistaken economy, have been allowed to
deteriorate until they are in a very defective condi-
tion. To put them in proper order will require an
expenditure of $80,000.
The taxes can be collected from about ninety
thousand seamen, which at two cents per day will
produce a revenue for the year of $648,000.
There are one hundred and ten thousand seamen
entitled to hospital relief, and the average num- I
ber requiring relief will be not far from oneand eight
tenths of one per ccnt.; that is, the number con- I
stantly sick will be about nineteen hundred. Tho
avoruge cost per day is a littlo over ono dollar per
man, or about ninoteou huniirod dollars, or l'or th 
yean, $693,500.
Tho repairs necessary at Chelsea hospital will
cost 810,0(10
Tho repairs necessary at Portland hospital
will cost  13,000
Tho repairs nocessary at St. Louis hospital
will cost  12,000
..ho repairs necessary at. Pittsburg hospital
will cost  10,000
the repairs necessary at Key West hospital
Trill cost  5,000
The repairs necessary at New Orloans hospital
will cost  4,000
The expense of furnishing the New York hos-
pital will be  7,000
The expenso of furnishing tho New Orleans
hospital will be  6,000
To put tho hospitals at Pittsburg, St. Louis,
Koy West, and Cleveland in good condition
as to furniture, instruments, &c  10,000
There is now duo the medical department.
United States Army, for supplies and furni-
ture sent to Chelsea, Portland, and Chicago.. 4,000
Total $81,000
With the means asked for the hospital sorvioe can
be made acceptable to the boneliuiurics and honor-
able to the Government.
The bill proposed will render tho servioo thence-
forward self-supporting.
I am, very respeotfully,
GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary of the Treanury.
Hon. Schcylkr Colfax, PretuleiU of the Semte.
Mr. HOWE. I did not know that there was
any such bill as this pending ; but I am glad
to hear it. The bill aims in the right direc-
tion ; and from the hasty examination I have
given it, and from listening to the .letter of the
Secretary of the Treasury that has just been
read, I am inclined to think that the bill may
accomplish a very much needed reform, which
ought to be taken in hand.
i once examined this subject pretty care-
fully. I went over your appropriations from
the foundation of the Government down to
this time. I think in the commencement of
this session the sum collected from the sailors
was twenty cents a month, and I believe that
is the sum collected from them under the laws
as they exist now. I speak from my recollec-
tion of an examination made two or three years
ago. For some twenty years of our history
that twenty cents a month was not only ade-
quate to the support of the sick and disabled
seamen, but my recollection is that out of
that fund was appropriated the money that
built the first marine hospital, that at Chelsea.
There did come a time, however, when it was
said that the sum collected from seamen was
not sufficient for their support, and the Gov-
ernment commenced to make appropriations
to eke out that service. For a few years
the appropriations were light. They finally
swelled up until, I think, they were for a great
many years $260,000 annually, no more, no
less, arguing, as I thought when I looked over
this matter, the most regular habits on the
part of our seamen as a class that I had ever
known on the part of any people on the face
of the earth. There never was a deficiency,
and there never was a surplus; it cost precisely
the same sum of money to take care of the
disabled seamen one year that it did another
year.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Were the same number
always sick?
Mr. HOWE. Yes; the same number were
always sick, and sick the same length of time,
and took medicines which cost the same amount
of money, and required the same amount of
nursing. I ought to qualify this, however, by
saying that I found one period, 1 think, of two
years in succession, when, by some mistake,
there was not any appropriation made. There
was not any deficiency for those years, how-
ever, but the service went right on in the same
way.
1 have no sort of doubt, and I insist that the
seamen of this country can take care of them-
selves as well as any class of people we have
fot; and if you let them do it they will do it.
have not a doubt about that. But I notice
in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
