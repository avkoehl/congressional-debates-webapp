THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 8,
ries belonging to the United States, and by the act
of January 10, 1871, placed under the charge of the
marshals of the respective Territories, and asking
if your suggestions meet with my approval.
In reply, I have to inform you that after a careful
consideration of the subject, I am clearly of the
opinion that it would be more advantageous, both
to the Government and the Territories, that said
penitentiaries should be under the control of the
territorial authorities, and a bill drawn with that
viow would meet with my approval. Such bill, how-
ever, should provide that the Territories willreceive
and maintain the convicts of the United States on
the same terms as the United States are now main-
taining the prisoners of the Territories; and, fur-
ther, that the legal title to the property shall still
vest in the United States.
I would be glad to examine the bill you may draw
b"fore it is introduced to Congress.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEORGE H. WILLIAMS,
Attorney General.
Hon. S. A. Mbrbitt, House of Representatives.
Mr. RANDALL. I would like to ask the
gentleman who has charge of this bill one
question. I do not see any provision made
for defraying the cost of maintaining these
penitentiaries and supporting the convicts. I
want to know whether that is to be borne by
the United States, and in every other particu-
lar the United States to have nothing to say
in connection with the management of the
penitentiaries in the Territories. [After a
pause.] I am informed by the Delegate from
Idaho [Mr. Merbitt] that the Territory is to
charge a dollar a day for each convict the Uni-
ted States puts in the penitentiary, and then
collect it from the United States. That appears
to me to be a very equitable arrangement.
Mr. TAFFE. This is thought to be the
more economical way of maintaining those
penitentiaries.
Mr. HOLMAN. Judging from the experi-
ence of the various States, I think the sum
charged for the maintenance of prisoners
should be less than one dollar per day. What
is the present cost of maintaining them ?
Mr. TAFFE. The Delegate from the Ter-
ritory of Idaho [Mr. Merritt] can answer the
gentleman.
Mr. MERRITT. The territorial prisons are
now in charge of the United States Govern-
ment, which pays for maintaining them, and
the Territories pay so much for the mainten-
ance of territorial prisoners, not less than one
dollar, and sometimes as high as two dollars
per day. I have here a statement, furnished by
the Department of Justice, as follows :
A statement showing the cost of equipping and main-
taining the penitentiaries of Colorado, Montana, and
Idaho from the time the marshals of said Territories
took charge of them up to date, as far as has been
avproved; also the number of persons confined
therein convicted of offenses against the laws if the
United States and of said Territories; also tohat
contracts have been made with said Territories for
keeping their convicts, and the sums of money paid
by each Territory for keeping its prisoners.
Colorado Territory penitentiary:
?.!.ir-ihal tool, c'lanrn of, M<irch31. 1871; post of

ber 1,1872. $22,622 99: existing contract expires May
31, 1872. By it the Territory pays seven dollars per
week for each of its prisoners. Payments by the
Territory, $13,631 57.

vember, 1872, $21,429 46; contract expires 1st of
July, 1873. By it the Territory pays one dollar per
day for each of its convicts, and all bills for medical

Payments by the Territory, $1,729.
The expense account for the month of October
was returned for correction. Contract with the
Territory expires 21st of March, 1873. The Terri-
tory pays seven dollars per week for each of its pris-
oners, which amount covers all expenses for thorn,
the United States incurring no additional expense
on their account.
From that statement it will appear that the
Colorado penitentiary cost for sixteen months
the sum of $24,716 99. The amount received
from the Territory was $13,631 57. There
was one Federal prisoner there for four
months at a cost of $2,771 35 per month, or
rather more than it would cost to maintain
several members of Congress during that time.
In Montana the cost of maintaining the peni-
tentiary for sixteen months was $23,143 73;
the amount received from the Territory was
$8,271. There was one Federal prisoner
maintained there for sixteen months at a cost
of $929 54 per month. The cost of maintain-
ing the Idaho penitentiary for sixteen months
was $8,398 32 ; the amount received from the
Territory was $1,729. The cost of maintain-
ing three Federal prisoners for thirteen months
was $513 02 each per month.
Mr. HOLMAN. From the statement of the
gentleman this would appear'to be a favorable
arrangement.
Mr. MERRITT. It will be advantageous
to the Government, and advantageous to the
Territories. There are very few Federal pris-
oners in the Territories, very few infractions
of Federal law. By >the arrangement pro-
posed in this bill the Government will have
to pay but a small sum in comparison with
the present cost. I think this is a good arrange-
ment both for the Government and the Terri-
tories.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. TAFFE moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Idaho Territory penitentiary:
Marshal took charge of, May 13, 1871: cost of
equipment, $1,400; cost of maintenance, $6,908 32 ;
total, $8,398 32.
Prisoners confined.

territorial court reports.
Mr. PARKER, of Missouri, from the Com-
mittee on the Territories, reported a bill (H.
R. No. 3360) to authorize the printing of the
reports of the supreme courts in the Terri-
tories ; which was read a first and second
time.
The question was on ordering the bill to be
engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, provides that the
decisions of the supreme courts of the several
Territories of the United States, as prepared
by the authorized reporters of said courts,
may be printed at the expense of the General
Government, whenever such reports shall be
sufficient in number to make a volume of not
less than two hundred and fifty pages, in form
and size to conform to the volumes of the acts
1 and journals of the Legislative Assemblies of
said Territories; said printing to be done under
the direction of the chief justice, or, in his
1 absence, of the senior associate justice of the
Territory, and the edition not to exceed two
hundred copies; provided that the cost of
printing said reports shall not exceed five dol-
lars per volume, and that not more than one
volume in each year shall be published.'
Mr. HOLMAN. It seems to me that this
is not a wise measure. I believe such a thing
has never been done before.
I think there is no State of the Union which
would think of publishing reports of the decis-
ions of its courts at its own expense. I do not
think there is any State of the Union where
those reports are published at all until the de-
mand for them is sufficient to justify their pub-
lication by private enterprise. I suppose most
of the States in connection with the public
offices of the State contribute to increase the
number of purchasers of the reports of decis-
ions of its courts, but nothing beyond that.
Now, the reports of the decisions of the terri-
torial courts are not of themselves of such gen-
eral importance as to justify this additional
expense. I trust the gentleman from Missouri
will not, therefore, add this additional expense
to the administration of our Territories. They
are not of such great authority as to justify it
at our hands. Comparatively little authority
is attached to the reports of decisions pro-
nounced by territorial courts. There are con-
stant changes in the personnel of the territorial
benches, and the reports of their decisions are
of comparatively little importance to the States
generally. I trust this measure will not pass.
Mr. PARKER, of Missouri. I ask the
Clerk to read the amendment as reported by
the committee.
The Clerk read as follows:
Amend by adding at the end of the bill the fol-
lowing:
" Provided, That the cost of printing and publish-
ing said reports shall not excced five dollars each :
And provided further. That not more than one vol-
ume in each year shall be published."
Mr. HOLMAN. I move to amend the text
of the bill as it stood by striking out the words
"the United States," or I believe the " Gen-
eral Government" is the language of the bill,
and to insert a provision that this publication
shall be at the expense of the Territories. If
they are to be published at all, it ought to be
done at the expense of the Territories. If these
reports are of such sufficient importance as to
justify publication at all, the people of the
Territories cannot object to paying for them.
Mr. PARKER, of Missouri. I see no neces-
sity for that amendment at all.
Mr. HOLMAN. I would not in my own
State support a proposition that the State
should pay the expense of publishing the re-
ports of decisions of its own courts.
Mr. TAFFE. I should like to suggest to
the gentleman from Indiana that the greater
proportion, perhaps more than one half of
these cases, involve the interests of the United
States.
Mr. HOLMAN. That may be.
Mr. TAFFE. They are mainly cases of
