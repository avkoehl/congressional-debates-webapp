Major General D. S. STANLEY,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

A member of the home guard reports a force of mounted rebels, rumored 300 strong, in the direction of Maynardville; last heard from six miles from here. The captain of the home guard sends word that he had information this morning of the approach of the party, and he is gathering his men. I have acted upon the rumor so much as to send guards to Roxbury Creek bridge.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. KIMBALL,

Send a regiment at daylight to ascertain the facts and find out what direction the rebs have taken, and what they are up to. May there not be a mistake?
