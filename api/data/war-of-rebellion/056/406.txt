Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Forces:

GENERAL: I have withdrawn my line to this side of the road leading to the river, 2 miles above Turley's Mill. I am thoroughly satisfied that Longstreet's command is in our front, and I think his cavalry is moving down the river. The picket from the Poor Valley road reports heavy firing over the mountain this evening in the direction of Tazewell. A dispatch came from General Foster to you; it had been opened by General Ferrero, and then addressed to you or me. I read it and sent it back immediately.

I am, general, very truly,

SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Our cavalry is now checked by the superiority of their force, and I desire you to make all possible haste in joining them. You will bring your wagon train and be able to subsist the command on the country as our cavalry are now doing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.
