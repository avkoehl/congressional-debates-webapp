ville confirms my views. I think Cairo is not in danger, and that we must now direct our efforts on Nashville. The rebels hold firm at Manassas. In less than two weeks I shall move the Army of the Potomac, and hope to be in Richmond soon after you are in Nashville. I think Columbus will be abandoned within a week. We will have a desperate battle on this line.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 20, 1862

Brigadier General G. W. CULLUM, Cairo:

It is absolutely necessary that the gunboats and mortar boats should all be ready for service by Monday morning. Call on Chicago for the mechanics and material required. Use the telegraph. Communicate with William B. Ogden, of Chicago.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT, Louisville:

Telegram received. Increase rolling stock on Nashville Railroad. At present not troops will move from East. Ample occupation for them here. Rebels hold firm at Manassas Junction.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 20, 1862-8 p.m.

Major-General McCLELLAN, Washington, D. C.:

I must have command of the armies in the West. Hesitation and delay are losing us the golden opportunity. Lay this before the President and Secretary of War. May I assume the command? Answer quickly.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 20, 1862

Brigadier-General CULLUM, Cairo, Ill.:

Get gun and mortar boats ready as soon as possible. Tell Commodore Foote or ranking naval officer to telegraph to Cincinnati for all mechanics they want. They must work day and night. Send all spare gun and mortar boats to make a demonstration on Columbus to-morrow. Let the mortar boats anchor, under the protection of the gunboats near enough to throw shells into the place, but run no risks. It is reported that they are sending their guns to Memphis. This can be ascertained by a judicious demonstration.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
