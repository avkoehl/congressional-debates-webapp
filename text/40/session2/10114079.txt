to them, to survey them for them, and to patent
the lauds to them. Now we cannst give them
patents unless we know the lands patented.
We must describe them, or else there will be
no protection to the Indians at last. The
Indians gave up all, I say,-of Colorado, includ-
ing all the gold and silver mines ofUiat country,
reserving only a small place, and they even
gave that up in 1865, reserving only these fifty
or sixty sections for their half-breeds. We
agreed to survey tliem and patent them to them.
If we do not do that the probability is the
Indians will lose them after having made val-
uable improvements; and that is one difficulty
of the Indians now. They are afraid to make
improvements for fear others will come along
and reap the rewards of their labor.
Mr. HOWE. Let me add one word. If I
supposed there was any sort of danger of these
parties losing their lands, I should be as anx-
ious to have the survey made as the Senator.
They ought to have the lands and must have
them; but nobody can get these lands until
the President patents them, and he certainly
is never going to patent these lands to any-
body in defiance or disregard of the obliga-
tions of that treaty.
One other word as to the matter of survey.
Suppose this appropriation is made and a sur-
veyor goes out and surveys these lands; it is
true he may form a connection by surveying
through from^the point at which our surveys
now stop in Kansas, or wherever it is, so that
these lands could be described in the patentas
other lands are described. But if that can be
done, it can be done by the Commissioner of
the Land Office with the moneys already in his
hands. We have appropriated from twenty to
thirty thousand dollars for surveys in Colorado
this year. He has money enough if you will
allow him to make the surveys, and I think he
is the better party to direct all surveys, and
he has money enough to do it.
Mr. HENDERSON. The Senator is aware
of the very great complaint at the Land Office
now about appropriations for surveys, and very
great complaints among the people in the
West in reference to them. They say sufficient
appropriations have not been made to carry
on the surveys. There is sad complaint there
now.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask leave to submit a
report from the committee of conference on
the tax bill.
ThePRESIDENT pro tempore. The report
will be received.
