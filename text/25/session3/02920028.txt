APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 4,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Graduation Bill—Mr. Benton.
Senate
There does not appear to be anything here re-
pealing or modifying the act of 1817   On the con-
trary, this section seems to have been framed with
a knowledge of the existence of that fundamental
law, otherwise, the member who drafted this ■sec-
tion would be chargeable with gross negligence
It does not attempt to define the term for which the  I
Delegate shall be chosen     He is to serv  tor the  I
term of two years, but it is not said when that
term is to begin and end   We must look elsewhere i
for that, and to aid us in the search, tms law of ||
1836, in the secion 1 have jast read, declares that
the Delegates " shall be entitled to the same rights
and privileges as have been gi anted to the Dele
gates from the several Territories "     Now, what '
are those rights and privileges ?    Where are they
to be found'   We must not look for them in the
act creating th« Michigan Territory, nor to the act
establishing Iowa      Ihose are -special acts, con
fined to those Territories respectively, and as we
are in search of rights and pnvileges which have ||
been granted to the Delegates from the several Ter-
ritories of the United Stales, we must look to some  |
geneial fundamemal law applicable to all the Ter
ntones      That la"  we find in the act of the 3d of
March, 1817, passed to correct an inconvenience ,
and irregularity growing out of eaieless legisla ion
in the case of the Missouri Terntoiy, ai d intended
to guard against the possibility of a contest such
as that the House is now considering                       i
Theie is language to be found in another section   |
of the act of lfcjo  establishing a territonal gov    I
eminent for Wisconsin, that may be relied on in
maintenance of the opu ion that the provisions of
the act of 1817, which we have been considering,
are not applicable to ilia' Feiritory     in the twelfth 1
section of that law, it is declared that " the said
* inhabitants shall also be entitled to all the rights,
'privileges,and immunities,heretoforegiantedand i
'secured to the Teiritoiy of Michigan, and to Us
' inhabitants, and the existing laws of the Tern
' tory of Michigan shall be extended over said ler
' ritory, so far m the same bhall not be incompatible
' wiihthe pt oimoni of this act "   In one of the laws
of Michigan, (act lbth February, 1813 ) theie is a
section directing the Governor of that lenitory
to furnish to the Delegate elect a < ertificate of his
election, and declaring that such Delegate snail be
entitled to a seat in Congress " for Ehc tei in of two I
years ftom the date of said certificate " and it is
sontended that this I uv of Mulligan has, by the
provisions of the twelfth section of the act of lis If!,
been extended ovei Wisconsin      \ moment's ex
ammation mu t show the faliai y of such ai  opin
ion    The twelfth section of the i t of 1836, Hates
•o the inhabitants of the 1 erinory     In it their
rights and pnvileges are defii ed   but in the four
teetith tec ion of the s-nie law, wt are to look for
the rights ai ' pnvih^es of the Dele-gate, and we
here find that they ire as grett, ard not gieatet,
han those granted, not to the Delegate from Mi hi
"an, but " to the  Delegates ftom the sevt al Ter
ritorieb of the United *st íes "    Moieovet   in the
twelfth section of the ictof  18%   ne have these
words   Sfeaking of the laws of Michi„an, it is
said that they shall be extended ov°i Wisconsin
"so far as the same shall  not be incompatible
with the piovis'ons of this act   '   lake, then, loth
these sections of the act of 1836 into consideration,
adopting a well established rule of constiuclion,
and let us see what is the conclusion to be neces
sarily leached      The law of Mid lgan gave to the
Delegate from that Terntoiy a light to a term in
Congiess for two year   from the date of the Gov
ernor's certificate     The fourteenth section of the
act of 1836 confers expressly upon the Delegate
fiom Wisconsin the ngnt to a tei m in Congiess
like that secured to th  Delegates from tin. '■neial
Territories of the I nited btates     1 ne twelfth sec

inati oi alt i"ü by the i c ot 1*30, a id having
slated why 1 beh ve that the two years'term ot
service, to wiiiun the Delegate from Wiscoi sin has
a light m the present Congress, commences and !|
terminates at the same periods with the terms of j
the members from the several States, I will next
inquire whether Geneial Jones is entitled to hold ,[
the seat he now occupies to the close of the present |
session     He was elected by the people of Wis
consm in October, 1836    About the same time
the membeis of this House fiom Ohio and Penn-
sylvania were chosen    As their rights to seats are
not contested, it will not be pretended that he has I
no right because the election was held in Wiscon  ^
sin before the term of seivice was to commence   .
He appeared here at the first session of the rjres- ]
ent Coigress, Wis qualified according to theestab
ashed foimsofour proceedings, and took his seat
The House did not adopt a formal resolution de   i
clanng that he was entitled to sit therein  as a '
Delegate to theTwenty Fifth Congress from Wis
consin, but this was done in effect     He was called
upon by the Presiding Officer, as the other mem
bers, to take the oath of office, and we sat by and
witnessed the proceeding, assenting  thereto  as
fully as we could have done by a vua voce vote
I he House was engaged in the exercise of that
high power derived from  tne "fl'tn section and
first article of the Constitution "    We weiejuds
ing of " the elections, retu ns, and qualifications"
oi  the membeis     And we deeded   that  Gorge
W  Jones was duly elected a Delegate from Wis
consin and acquiesced in his appearance amongst
us to take lus seat as such     We adjudged that
he was duly qualified     Such being the facts, I
am at some loss to conjecture in what part of the
Const tution, in what law, or in what usage is to
be found the power to adopt a resolution declaring
iliat James 13   Doty is entitled to a seat in this
House as a  Delegate fi   in Wisconsin      There
cannot be two Delegates  from one Territory m
Congress at the same time     For the power to
admit Mr  Doty, I have examined the report of
the Committee of Elections, but I find nothing
there to satisfy my mind     In that report I find
much  to prejudice and  bewilder the judgment,
which ought not to have been introduced       It
serves not to enlighten, but to contuse     We aie
there told  that it Geneial Jones is peimitted to
occupy this seat until the present sf-sion closes,
he  will have been a  member of Congress  for
tinte   legular  sessions undei   one  election       If
this were tine what po sil le influence should it
have upon the judgments cf men suting here as a
judicial tribunal      We are not to decide whethei
Geneial Jones sdt in the last  Congress with  oi
without legal authonty      Each Congress is to
]udge of the election and ouahfication of its own
members     If the last Congiess decided tnatGen
eral Jonts wis entitled to take his seat there,n as
a Delegate, and eired in that decision, can we cor
rect tin t en or by usurping a power to dismiss him
now, if he be entitled to tins seat'   That he is so
entitled, we have already deeuled at the fiist ses
ion of this Congress     We sail that he is duly
elected a membei of the T went i V fth Co  giess,
and this decisu n gave him a title to be in his seat
whenevei the   Twenty Fifth Congiess is in   ses
sion     But, sn    I mamti in tl at he was n< t duly
qualified as a   Delegate   ti   the   Twentj  Four h
Cmgiess fiom Wiscoi sin     He had been elected
as  a Delegate to the  Iwenty Fouith Congies-,
from Mientan     Un Itr tl at election, he an >ea ed
and was quahfiid at the «> I ses i >n of th i  ( on
gress     Mi filian d d  not come into  the Unun
until January, lb37, subsequent to the Urn" when
General Jones took the oath as a Delega e fiom
Wisconsin       1 he   oa'h of r dice was   therefore
void     He could not be a representative fiom two
lerritoties  at one and the same   moment    and
benig a qualified  Delegate from Michigan at the
second session of the last Congress, he could not,
without resigning that office, lega ly qualify and
•ake another     But, I ag in a«k, what nave these
irregular proceedings to do wi h the question now
to be  decided'     We  are  now cal ed   upon  to
cunstiue  laws      We  aie aa ng judicially,   tnd

question according to the d.ctatcs of an unbiased
reason I know well that I and those who concur
with me in these views are to be found in a mi
nonty But minorities have no terrors for me
Those acts of my political life to which I recur
with most pride and pleasuie, weie when I had
few, very few, indeed, to countenance heartily the
proceeding I belong rot to that class of men
who are " preserved 'rom shame" only "by

THE Gu\DUAHO^ BILL
SPEECH OF HON. T. H. BENTON,
OF   MISSOURI,
In Senate, Janumy 4,1839,
On theGraduation bill, and in reply to Mr Clay's
attacks upon General Jackson
Mr BENTON rose, in consequence of the
endless attacks made upon an eminent citizen,
now retired fiom public life, and seeking repose
under his own vine, and by the side of his own
fire, but foi whom, it would seem, there was to
be no peace on this side of the grave He alluded
to tne late President of the United States, General
Jackson, and to the íepeateu instances in which
his name had been dragged into this debate, and
tyianny and mischief attributed to him for bis
conduct m relation to the act for the distribution
of the proceeds of the public lands That conduct
had been denounced as tyrarnical and unconsti-
tutional and to it had been attnbuted all the late
moneyed embairassments of the countiy The
Senator from Kentucky [Mr Clay] is the author
of these denunciations, and also the author of the
bills, for there were two of them, the loss of which
he so much det lores, and fi r the want of v  hich
he has seen so much evil anse I (said Mr B )
was the contempoiai y of thesebills I knew their
character and their fate I saw their birth and their
death, and great and numerous as aie the acts
which stamp the chaiacter of a hero statesman
on General Jackson, there are none which exalt
him more thin his conduct in ¡elation to these
very bil s It was wise, patriotic, constitutional,
and heroic conduct He had the wisdom to see
the pernicious nature or these bills, he i ad the
constitutional right to ariest them, and he had the
heroism to exercise that right The bil's were
of tl e most seduc ive chaiacter, they were cal-
culated to seduce all utnefiecfing minds, for they
pioposed j distribut on, among the people, of near
sixty ot seventy m llions of dolíais The dis
tnbution would have l"ft the Treasury bare, it
would have bankrup ed the denosit banks , it
might have debauched the States it would have
compelled a resoitto loans or a new tariff-, and it
would have se the fatal examole of hvish'ng
the public money, and also the public pi iperty,
upon the people on the eve of the presidential
ele tions The <hst bill passed tne two Houses
in 1832 just btfi r  the j> e'identitl e'e tion,and
