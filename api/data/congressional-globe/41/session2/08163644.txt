DIVORCES IN THE DISTRICT 01? COLUMBIA.
Mr. COWLES, from the same committee,
i reported back, with an amendment in the nature
j of a substitute, the bill (S. No. 76) concerning
i] divorces in the District of Columbia.
1 The Senate bill was read. It provides that
in all cases in which by existing law the supreme
' court of the District of Columbia is authorized
, to decree divorces from bed and board it shall
i in cases hereafter instituted have authority in
its discretion to declare divorce from the bonds
of matrimony.
The substitute reported by the committee
was then read, as follows:
That in addition to the causos for which the su-
preme court of the District of Columbia may now
grant divorces from the bonds of matrimony such
divorces may be granted forâ€”
First. Habitual drunkenness for tho period of three
years on tho part of tho party complained against.
Second. Cruelty of treatment endangering the life
and health of the party complaining.
Third. Willful desertion and abandonment by the
party complaincd against of tho party complaining
for the full and uninterrupted space of three years.
Mr. NIBLACIv. I desire to inquire whether
the committee will not consent to make the
period of abandonment less than three years?
I move to strike out" three" and insert" two."
' I think that is long enough.
Mr. LAWRENCE. What time does the
bill fix ?
Mr. NIBLACK. Three ye.irs. My amend-
ment will keep the people of this District from
!! going out West and obtaining a residence there
, for the purpose of procuring divorces. I desire
; to protect the western Stales from the emigra-
tion that goes there to seek divorces. I hope
there will be no objection to the amendment.
Mr. COOK. Iam very much opposed to
shortening the time of abandonment for which
divorces may be granted. It seems to me that
the bonds of matrimony will be light enough,
1 even if we do not make them as light in this
j: District as they are in the State represented
