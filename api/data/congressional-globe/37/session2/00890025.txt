THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ADJOURNMENT OVER.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that when the House
adjourns it adjourn to meet on Monday next. I
will simply state that we are authorized by the
Secretary of the Treasury to say that his report
will not be communicated to the House until Mon-
day, and it is desirable that the way shall not be
much more occupied until some bills shall be re-
ported from the Committee of Ways and Means.
Hence I make the motion.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I desire to make an in-
quiry of the gentleman. There are some who
were members of the other branch of Congress at
the last session, who are now no more. Would
it not economize time if the announcement of the
death of one of them was to be made this week?
Mr. STEVENS. The Senate have adjourned
over till Monday.
Mr. WASHBURNE. The deaths will be an-
nounced next week.
The question was taken on Mr. Stevens's
motion, and it was agreed to.
