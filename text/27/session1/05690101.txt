APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Loan Bill—Mr. Watterson.
~TW~
These manly sentimenu -how that you have at
least one honest editor m your party,a gentleman
who has the courage to ('enounce falsehood and
corruption when committed by his political friends.
Col Milburn has been removed solely for opi-
nion's sake The declarations oí Harrison and Ty-
ler, and the Wtbstenan edict, have all been
falsified m this remorseless removal These proofs
and evidences are before the hung world, and the
judgment of earth will forever rest upon that odious
transaction
The territories of Wiskonsan and Iowa have
been scourged as with a pestilence Such a uni-
versal proscription has never fallen upon any peo
pie—no, not even m a conquered province The
Governors, Secretaries, Marshals, District Attor-
neys, Surveyors General, Registers and Receivers of
Land Offices—all, all have b-en swept off Time
would not ailow me to point out the individual cases
of outrage that have been perpetrated But, sir,
allow me to call your attention to the case of Go-
vernor Dodge. He is a prominent victim, and is
known in every part of that great valley He was
an active and efficient officer in the war of 1812,
and subsequently held various offices in Missouri,
both civil and military
When General Dodge removed to Wiskonsan,
there were wuhin its limits a great number of the
aboriginal inhabitants, the red men of the forest
In '832 a war broke out between them and the
whiter, and, sir, that war came from a race of men
who do not precede hostilities by wordy negoti-
ations, they make no foimal declarations of then
purpose, they act like John Bull, when, under the
cover of night, he violated our territory, burnt the
steamboat Caroline at Schlosser, and muidered
one or more of our citizens That war was with
a race oí men who give no other notice of their
purpose than the \ ar whoop, and the sound of the
rifle It was with a race of men who seldom give
quarter, and who count their victories by the num-
ber of scalpi they have taken The gallant men
of the Territory came to the rescue General
Dodge organized a =mall but intrepid corps, who
took the field, and, as. far as possible, staid the
plague, until the voluntéis from Illinois, and a
few companies of the army, could be brought to
their rehet During this penod the enemy way
laid all the roads, and murdered many of the inha-
bitants One meidentcoiinected with this war will
serve to illustrate the tharactei of General Dodge
and his followers.
The enemy came t< th<- Pecatolica, and mur-
dered «ome of the c 'tzens Dodge and his party
pursued them, and being on horseback, came in
sight of them in a few hours in the open prairie
There were/ourteen Indians, and, I believe, twen-
ty two whites Toe enemy, find ng they could not
make their escape, postel themselves for battle m
a small giove oi timber
Now here was just tnt, situation to test the cou-
rage and demotion of any min to his country.
The exasperated enemy were armed with the rifle,
tomahawk, and spear, which they had been accus-
tomtd to u'-e all their lives Thty had a decided
advantage in position, protected as they were by
the trees of the forest, and were enabled to have
their usual advantage—the first fire
To dislodge the en^my a charge must be made
in the open prairie, m the most exposed of all po -
sible s tuauons, and from the number and despera
tion of tne enemy, at a great sacrifice of human
life In such a situation what is the course of
Dodge and his brave associates? They never he-
sitate They le olve to dulodge the enemy or pe-
rish in the attempt They dismount from their
horses, and, headed by their coiimander, charged
the enemy on foot Tnt y received the enemy's
fire when almc st at the muzzle of their guns A
desperate conflict ensued between the survivors
and the enemy After each party had delivered its
fire it became a personal encounter between the ex
asperated combatants
The story is soon told The enemy all fell
Not a man oí them was left to tell the tale.
I met him and the survivors of his party a few
davs aftei wards, and some of them still earned
upon their persons the evidence^ the conflict
The long and arduous services which he subse-
H. of Reps.
quently performed, his visits to ai d trea íes with
several Indian tribes, as far west as the Rocky
Mountain , his appointment to the office from
which he has been to unjustly dismissed, and.his
conduct while in it, it is unnecessary to dilate upon
They have become matters of history.
A leading Whig journal of Illinois, speaking of
his removal from office, and protesting against it,
says
As one of the brave detender of Wiskonsan   in times that
tried the courage of the best of men on that frontier, he (Gene
ral Dodge) stand  deseivedly among the foiemost "
Again

Here is the testimony of a political opponent of
General Dodge, one whose location and means of
information eoable him to appreciate public senti-
ment Yet m the face of all this, and violation
of their ow n pledgee, and in contempt of the known
sentiments of the whole country, th s same Henry
Dodge has been stricken from the rolls of the pub-
lic service
Let me ask the Senator from South Carolina,
who "o eloquently denounced proscnption, if he
approves of this removal' Is this "proscription
proscribed"*" Would that Hon Senator, or any
other man h ivmg an American heart in his bjsom,
have removed Dodge?
Let me tell the citizens of Wiskonsan and Iowa,
why it is that such desolation, in ihe way of pro-
scription, has swept over their land, it is because
old Federalism wants to triumph over them The
second reign of terror has commenced The ob-
ject is to make war upon your Democratic princi-
ples-, to break down your Democratic men, and to
bring those two territories into the Union as States,
m Federal leading strings They wehknow that
Wi konsan and ¡owa, are destined to hold the ba-
lance of power in the Senate of the United States,
and it benooves them to manacle these young giants
in. time
I have no fears for the result I know some-
thing of he noble hearted, untemfied Democracy
in those Ternioms They can accomplish who-
ever man can accomplish, and can do whatever
patriot sm and honor may require at their hands
A few more words, and I have done Sir, what
hd\e the American people beheld since the present
Administration came m'o power—an Administra-
tion pledged «gcu* sí 'lemvvals i Why, sir, a svstera
of proscription, on acconnt of political opinion,
unparalleled in any age or any country All the
Surveyors General of the United States or nearly
so—all the Governors and Secretanes of Terntoriss
—almost all the collectors and subordinate  in the
custom houses—district attorneys and mar hal —
wi'h postcnster-> htjond number, are, in three
short months of the rei n of ihe present dynasty,
swept from office, and, as many of their own join
nnls admit, without cau>-e, and in violation of the
pledges of th.U party Tne pioscnption has beep
carried down to humb   tide a ait rs
Wire pledges evet made o solemnly as the
leaders of that party made them ?gainst removal ,
and were evei pledges so soon violated after they
v ere made' Does the historv ot man's political
depravity iurnish  any  parallel to conduct   like
hiO
The people voted with flat pirty upon their
own principle-, ana now wh°n they have obtained
power by that vute, they turn upon their heel, and
showing their habitual coni mpt of the people, they
violate not only their o«n pledges, but the solemn
injunctions which the popular suffrage imposed
upon them
Sir, I have not ph5sical strengtti to g> through
with this argument, nor to mvestiga'e it, as it
should be investigate! The people can now judge
which party in mamtamg the r respective pnn„i-
ples, has done most to degrade, and which has done
most to elevat* the dignity of man's nature
I will neither attempt to prop íecy noi to con-
jecture But thus much I will <-a/, that if the soul
of man has not lost the faculties that God im-
pressed upon it, the people of this great land will
make a day of political reckoning with this Fede-
ral dynasty.
REMARKS OF MR. WATTERSON,
OF TBNFESSEE,
fa the Heme of Representatives, July 9, 1841.—In
Committee of ihe Whole, on the loan bill.
Mr. WATTERSON of Tennessee arose and
said
Mr Chairman- The gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Saltonstall] who has just taken his
seat, disclaimed all intention to harrow up the
party feelings of this committee, yet his whole
speech, from beginning to end, was a tirade of
abuse against the last Administration. He says
those who are now in power inherited a debt of
twelve millions fiom those who have just gone out
of power This I deny. The Secretary of the
Treasury himself, with all bis disposition to hum-
bug and lmpo'o upon the country, only makes a
deficit at the end of this year of $6,000,941 14;
after including near three millions of new appro-
priations that we are called upon to make at thw
extraordinary session of Congress But, sir, the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury has been
so ably and triumphantly exposed by others, that I
will content myself with giving it a passing kick,
and then go on in the statement ol some plain,
stubborn facts, in reply to many false charges that
have been made against the party with which it is
my pride and my pleasure to act, and perhaps, be-
fore I conclude, I may carry the war into the
enemy's camp
The Secretary of the Treasury proposes to ex-
pend from the 4th of March, 1841, to the 1st
of January    -           -           -   $26,731,336 98
He states the expenditure from
the 1st of January to the 4th
of March, 1841, to be            -       4,627,166 64
Making the expenditure for the
whole year    -           -           -   #31,368,503 62
Making an average per month  -     $3,673,133 69
The expenditure for the last year,
including   the  redemption  of
Treasury notes
Monthly average
-   |27,863,475 41
Making the monthly average of
1841, over the monthly average
of the extravagant year of Mr.
Van Buren, 1840
2,321,789 61
|351,344 08
But this statement is evidently unjust to the last
Administration    The Secretary in his report states
the expenditures from the 1st of January to the
4th of March,  and the monthly expenditure, as
above stated, includes the three first days of March,
n which lar^e payments,  were made in complet-
ing thx pay to  members of Congress, and other
expenditures  at the close of Congress, as well as
large sums  of money sent to  different pension
agents, to meet the semi annual payment of pen-
sions due on the 4th of March, and in addition to
this,  the sum of five hundred thousand dollar , re-
ceived in Treasury notes at the custom*, between
the lot of January and the 4th of March, are put
down as a par of the expenditure ot those months,
althoygn they do not appear in the books of the
Treasury  until after that period, and ought of
ourseto  be deducted from the alleged expendi-
ture    See House Doc No 2, p 2, note.
This sum deducted from the al-
leged expenditure  leaves the
actual expenditure, from the
1st of January to the 4th of
March           -           -           -    #4,127,166 64
And would average per month,
meiuding the three first days
m March      -          -           -       2,063,883 32
And according ro this average
the expenditure of the year
1841, should be        -           -     24,762,999 84
And makes the average monthly
expenditure of the ten months
proposed by the Secretary, ex-
ceed the monthly expendi-
ture of the two firstj months   -         609,550 37
