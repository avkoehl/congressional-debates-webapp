In the Field, January 24, 1865. (Received 7.35 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

I have barges all ready to chain together and fill up the draw in the bridge. It would be useless to sinks them. Would it not be well to put these in position as soon as all the gun-boats are above? They could not then fall below the bridge. The Onondaga now lies only a short distance above Aiken's instead of being close below the obstructions, where she could take advantage of any delay the enemy meets with there.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, City Point:

General Ferrero reports that a small tug, seen near the wreck of the enemy's gun-boat, drifted to the obstructions; was boarded by our men and towed to shore. It was injured by the explosion, was partially filled with water, and contains four torpedoes.
