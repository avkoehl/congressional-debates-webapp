Mr. TRUMBULL. I will state to the Sen-
ator from Oregon, if he will allow me, that by
act of Congress the United States courts con-
form as to the competency of testimony to the
Suite law. We also hare another general law
bv which in suits by executors. administrators,
and persons suing in a fiduciary capacity of
that character, where they are parties, the
other party is not permitted to testify to any
statements made by them.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Made by the deceased?
Mr. TRUMBULL. Made by the deceased.
This bill perhaps goes a step further in ex-
tending it to the exclusion of vendors and
assignors: but we have a statute already adopt-
ing the State laws upon this subject, and we
thought there was no necessity for this bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Oregon desire the bill to be placed on the
Calendar, with the adverse report of the com-
mittee?
Mr. WILLIAMS. Yes, sir; let it go on the
Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will go on the
Calendar with the adverse report.

G RENVILLE M. DODQE.
Mr. WILSON. I am directed by ibe Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (H. R. No. 1892) making an
appropriation to satisfy a judgment obtained
against Grenville M. Dodge, late an officer of
the Lnited 8tates, and others, for acts done by
them in the line of their duty, to report it back
without amendment.
The VICE PRE8IDENT. Tho bill will be
placed on the Calendar.
Mr. HOWELL. I should be very much
gratified if that bill could be read a third time
and put on its passage now. I shall be greatly
obliged to Senators if they will consent to it.
By unanimous consent,the Senate, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
bill. It appropriates the sum of $5,000, or aa
much thereof as may be necessary, to enable
the Secretary of War to satisfy a judgment ob-
tained against Grenvilte M. Dodge, late an
officer of the United States, and others, for
acts done by them in the line of their duty,
under orders from their superior officers, and
to defray the cost of defending the suits at law
in which snch judgment was recovered.
Mr. HOWE. Is there any report accom-
panying the bill?
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is no
written report.
Mr. HOWELL. The bill has passed the
House of Representatives, and is reported
favorably here by the Committee on Military
Affairs. The circumstances are simply these:
in the execution of orders during the war Gen-
eral Dodge took possession of some cattle in
Kansas which were replevied, and he not being
able to be there to defend the suit judgment
was obtained, and the suit was certified to
Iowa, and execution has issued in Pottawat-
. omie county, the place of General Dodge's
' residence, and he is harassed by the issue of
execution and levy upon his property. It is
a case in which there is no question whatever
of the propriety of the action of Congress in
the premises, I believe.
Mr. HOWE. How came General Dodge to
take the cattle? He was not in the commis-
sary department, was he ?
Mr. HOWELL. It was during the war, and
he took them in some way.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Under orders?
Mr. HOWELL. They were taken nnder
orders for the military department at the time.
Mr. SHERMAN. There was a general i
order issued requiring Army officers to seize
all the supplies in certain regions of country.
I prestim" that is this case.
Mr. POMEROY. But not in Kansas.
Mr. HARLAN. This order was issued to
break up cattle-stealing in the Indian territory
with a view of protecting the Indians. The
cattle that were taken by order of General
Dodge were herds of cattle driven out of the
Indian country into Kansas for sale. Certain
parties replevied the cattle, and finally got
judgment in one case against General Dodge.
The transcript of that judgment has been sent
to one of the courts in Iowa and docketed,
and execution has issued upon it.
Mr. HOWE. What became of the cattle
that were seized ?
Mr. HARLAN. Some of them were recov-
ered by the parties who replevied, and some of
them were used by the Army.
Mr. CONKLING. What is the amount of
the judgment?
Mr. HARLAN. I do not remember the
exact amount. It is less than five thousand
dollars.
Mr. HOWELL. Five thousand dollars, I
think.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin object to the bill?
Mr. HOWE. No, sir. I do not want to
interpose an objection; but I think it is a little
extraordinary that such a bill should be pre-
sented about which we can have so few facts
as to the amount of the judgment, or the party
recovering it, or why he recovered it.
Mr. HOWELL. The amount of the judg-
ment is stated in the bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
