THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 2,
aecfuitted hjm of the remotest purpose of strength-
ening the hands of a toreign Power against the
interests of his own country and State.
Mr. ADAMS made a similar explanation m
regard to Mr. Biddle, on whom he pronounced
a short but beautiful eulogium He insisted on
his own right to combat the arguments of any
other member with all the force in his power, and
protested against its being interpreted as the
sbghtestreflection against such member, and the
strenoousness with which he had resisted the
speech of Mi B. was but a proof in how high a
degree he appreciated the talents of that gentle-
man, and their effect upon the House.
The question being on the motion of Mi. John-
son, of Maryland, to amend the bill by inserting
a provision for the puichase of a site for a found-
ery of cannon,
Mr. J. supported the motion in a short speech,
and then, at the request of Mi Robfrtson, modi-
fied his motion so as to require that the piece of
ground purchased should not be less than fifty
nor over one hundred acres
The question being then taken, the amend-
ment was negatived.
Mr. WISE moved to amend the bill by striking
out all after the enacting clause, and insci ting the
following as a substitute

Mr W expicssed hes hope that the committee
would be brought to a unanimous vote in favoi
of this amendment It wt nt to avoid all tin (lis
puted questions on the bill, and n duittl it in fact

was as far as he could go The wholt measiiit
was,at last, but a mi mice , uid, as such, it would,
with such apowti as Git at Bittain, opt latxi tllit i
as an obstacle to ntgotiation, than an au\iluuy

was not of a wailtke disposition—but n chieftain
might hueafter use, and pit ad this at tab i pic-
ceoent. He believed the uoist about wai tobe
all humbug, but, if a wai did ensue, he would
not go as far as these resolutions went, but he
would go further—he would ask Picstdent Van
Buren for an office
A Voice    What will it be >
Mr, WISE did not say, but obseived that if
this substitute should not be agre ed to, he would
then move tesolutions geneially similai to thost
which have been submitted to the Stnate by a
Senator fiom Pennsylvania, [Mi   Buciiinan 1
The question being put, the amendment was
negatived--ftyes 73, noes 84
Mr, WISE now moved to stnkc out the sec-
ond section of the bill, which is at, follows
Sec 2 Jind he it further enacted, 1 hat in tin event

raised by virtue of this act whenever the occasion for them,
as defined by this act, shall cease to exist
Aftei the reading of a substitute for that sec-
tion, which Mr McKAY was desirous of offer-
ing when in order,
The question was taken by tellers on Mr
Wise's motion to strike out, and decided in the
affirmative—ayes 95, noes 78
So the second section of the bill was ordered to
be stricken out
Mr McKAY (chairman of the Military Com-
mittee) now moved to fill the blank occasioned by
the above vote, by inserting the following.
Pec 2 And he it further enacted, That the militia, when
called into the service of the United ¡states by virtue of this
act or of the act entitled" An act to provide for calling

A member moved to extend the term of mili-
tia scivict to twelve months instead of si\, but
it was negatived
1 lie question on Mi McKay's amendment was
Í then divided, and being put first on so much as
íelates to the teim of militia seivice, it was ear-
ned—ayes 105, noes not counted .
The question being then put on the residue of
the amendment, íeiatmg to volunteers,
Mi WISE opposed it as going, in substance,
to reenactthe second section, which hadjust'been
stucken out                                                                  |
Mr McKAY denied this, and spoke a shotti
time m vindication of the amendment                     i
Mr BRIGCjb moved to amend the amendment '
by limiting the numbti of voluntous to twelve |
tbousuid, which was ie|cetcd                                  ,

Mi BRONSOJN called foi a count, and rose
amid loud cues of "question" and " ordei,"
and, ordtr being in some meisure restoied, Mr
1! said that gentlemen might cty " question" aa
lout' as they pleased, but he should not be de-
teired fiom explaining and insisting upon this '
amendment, and he would stand m his place and
insist upon a heaangto the last day, if necessary !
to insure a heaung upon 'his amendment

order, and oider being restoied in the Hall,           I
Mr. BRONSON proceeded   to say that the i I
amendment which had been offered by hts col- I
league [Mr Fillmore] was of the utmost ím-
poitance to the northern fiontter, and that with-
out it the bill would be defective and pait.al
Mr. B said that, by the third section of the
bill, the Piesident was authonzed, in case of in-
vasion or imminent dangei of hostilities, to fit out
and arm the whole naval fotee of the United States,
and, by that means, the bill piovided, in the event
of that contingency, for the protection of the At-
lantic coast, and of our tiade on the ocean, as far
as the whole naval foice of the United States was
adequate to such protection, but it must be borne
m mmd that the United States had no vessels of
any description on the northern lakes or rivers
which could be fitted out, or put in commission—
not a single vesssel—not even a gunboat, did the
United States own on those waters, as he believed,
which could be used or made set viceable, and yet,
in the event of hostilities occurring which aie in-
tended to be piovided for by this bill, those north-
ern lakes and rivers would be the principal theater
of hostilities, and it would be by means of naval
forces on those lakes that the country could not
only be severely annoyed, but the fiontiei devas-
| fated Hostile operations along the whole of that
fionttei must and would be principally on the
lakes, and Mi B insisted that, if the bill under-
took to piovide for putting out \esscls of wai in
a state of preparation and lepairs, in case of the
contingency mentioned in the bill, it was equally
impoitantthat the Piesident should "be authorized
to purchase or chaitei such vessels as might be
obtained on those wa'eis, and which might be
leadily put in commission and made serviceable
for the defense of the country
Mr B stud that, a« the thud section now
stood without this amendment, it provided, so far
as we weie able, for the defense of the whole At-
lantic coast, but no piovision whatever, not the
least, was made foi the noithein frontier It was
partial and unjust m this respect, and, though he
trusted and believed that no contingency would
happen lendeung any portion of this section ne-
cessity, yet if any piovision was to be made, let
it be geneial and impartial, and such as will op-
crate foi the benefit of the noithein frontiei, as
well as the Atlantic coast
Mi 13 said he had not usen to make a speech
upon this subject, and would not detain the com-
mittee, he had meiely wished, in the shoitest
time and fewest words possible, to explain to the
House the natuie and piopnety of the amend-
ment offeied by his colleague, [Mi Fillmore,]
and having done so, he tutsted it would now be
adopted
The amendment was agieed to
An amendment empoweung the President to
arm all the fortifications was moved by some mem-
ber not asceitatned by the íeporter, and nega-
tived
Mi McKAY now moved to amend the bdlby
adding theieto the following
