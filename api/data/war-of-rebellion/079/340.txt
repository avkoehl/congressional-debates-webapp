Fayette through Villanow via Ship's Gap. We will scout along the mountain till we reach Broomtown Valley and then cross into Will's Valley. I have forwarded a messenger to General Schofield as directed. I joined Captain O'Reily this morning. The above information can be relied upon.

A force is reported at Jonesville, Va. ; uncertain. A small party captured the 100-days' men at Mossy Creek; did no damage to road or bridge. It is rumored Williams is to join Hood.

NASHVILLE, October 17, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I wish you to at once collet your troops together and readjust them in such a way as will enable the withdrawal of Schofield, with Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISIONS, and secure the safety of Chattanooga against any attempt of the enemy. Report to me the orders you may give to secure this object.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have two regiments on duty in Major-General Rousseau's district, located at Estill Springs and Decherd. If he will order them to Bridgeport I can relieve General Wagner's and General Morgan's DIVISIONS, and have 4,500 organized troops here for defense, exclusive of camp of detachments, at least 1,000 strong. This does not include guard on railroad.

Respectfully,

J. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
