They are all of irregular or State organizations and the cartel provides only for the exchange of prisoners belonging to the Confederate Army.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., September 12, 1862.

General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: There are a number of prisoners of war at Sandusky who claim to belong to the Confederate Army and to have the right of exchange. Some belong to Morgan's men, others to Morehead's and some are Virginia and Missouri troops; some are on the rolls as recruits, citizens, &amp;c. There are a number who desire to take the oath of allegiance and some wish to be released on parole. I respectfully desire instructions as to the proper course to be pursued in these cases.
