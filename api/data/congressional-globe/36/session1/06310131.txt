THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
SPEECH OF HON. A. A. BURNHAM,
OF CONNECTICUT,
In tiie House of Representatives,
March 7, 18G0.
The IIou^c being in the Committee of the Wljoleonthe
state of the Union—
Mr. BURNHAM said:
Mr. Chairman: The President of the United
States, in his annual message to the two Houses
of Congress, congratulates us as follows:
"I cordially congiatulate you upon the final settlement
by the Supreme Com t of the United States of the question
of slaveiy in the Territories, which had presented an aspect
so tiuly formidable ar the commencement of my adminis-
tration. The right has been established of every citizen to
take his property of any kind, including slaves, into the
common Territories*, belonging equally to all the States of
the Confi'deiacy, and to have it protected there under the
Federal Constitution. Neither Congress nor a Territorial
Legislature, nor any human power, has any authority to
annul or impair tln^ verted right. The supreme judicial
tribunal of the countiy, which is aeon'dmate branch of the
Government, ha*'sanctioned and affirmed these principles
of constitutional law,so manifestly just in themselves,and
fio well calculated to promote peace and liaimony among
the States."
It would seem, Mr. Chairman, that if this whole
question touching the rights of slave property in
the Territories of the United States had thus been
finally and completely settled by the Supreme
Court of the United States, as the President de- '
clares it to have been, those in whose favor this !
question has been settled might, for a while at j
least, have permitted this exciting topic to remain :
at rest. Ifthoseaguinstwhoseinterestsandagainst j
whose opinions this question had been thus set- !
tied were content not to renew this cxciting sub- !
jeet, which had so much and so long disturbed j
the country, those in whose favor it had been set- j
tied should have allowed the subject to rest in !
peace. So far as I know, so far as 1 believe, there i
was no disposition on the part of members of the j
Republican party who occupy seats in this House i
to renew, unnecessarily, this disturbing agitation. !
So far as I know and believe, they were content !
and ready to leave it, for the present at least, and !
to unite with those who came here also opponents j
of this Administration (though differing* with us, j
many of them, on this subject) in ferreting out its !
abuses, corruptions, and extravagances, m order I
that the people of the country might be fully pos-
sessed of the facts. Notwithstanding these were
the purposes, and this the disposition of the Re-
publican members, and of those who, to some ex-
tent, were affiliated with them, yet, at the very I
outset of this session—at its very commencement !
—a state of things arose, and was for more than j
eight weeks continued, which has rendered it quite j
evident to even the most careless observer, that I
the irrepressible conflict is still afoing on, and that
it will not be permitted by gentlemen on the other
side to cease. Not even allowing this House to
be organized; not even allowing its constitutional
officers to be chosen, so that it might proceed
with decorum and in order, they thrust this fire-
brand into these excitable elements which arc so
easily inflamed by the discussion of this question.
Mr. REAGAN. I do not wish to interrupt the
gentleman, but I would like to ask him a question.
Mr. BURNHAM. I would be obliged to the
gentleman if he will not interrupt me. I think it
much better that these interruptions should not
be allowed
The CHAIRMAN. Docs the gentleman from
Connecticut yield the floor to the gentleman from
Texas ?
Mr. BURNHAM. I do not, with all rcspcct
to the gentleman from Texas.
For more than eight weeks, Mr. Chairman, we
on this side of the lr£ouse sat here quietly, peace-
ably, under a storm—an incessant storm—of cal-
umny and abuse poured upon us and upon our
people, such as, I venture to say, could find no
parallel in the past annals of congressional his-
tory, and, as I hope, will not find a parallel in
the future; in whicn vituperation took the place
of argument, and epithets abounded more than
facts. Our opponents, pursuing a course which
assumed at the outset that the Republican mem-
bers had not equal rights here with themselves,
ask the House to pronounce, by a deliberate vote
on the passage of a resolution, that members en-
tertaining certain political opinions, or having
indorsed certain opinions, either advisedly or un-
advisedly, were unfit to occupy the position of
Speaker of this House; thereby undertaking to
distinguish between the rights of members on this
floor to entertain their own opinions on political
questions; as if it required some other and higher
qualification, politically, to occupy a seat in that
chair than to occupy a seat on this floor. The res-
olution was not only disrespectful in terms to
members who entertained these opinions, but was,
through them, alike disrespectful to their constit-
uents, to the people who sent them here, knowing
full well what opinions they entertained, *
I do not wish to speak further in regard to the
course of that debate, or of its characteristics from
the beginning to the end.
Parties in this country are kntfwn by names
which they have respectively chosen to designate
themselves; and whenever I shall have occasion to
speak of those parties I hope that I may so far
observe the proprieties of the occasion, and the
respect which is due from me to members of this
House, as to speak of them by the names which
they have chosen for themselves. I think our
discussions here should be characterized by calm-
ness, fairness, and courtesy.
Many accusations have been bro'ught against
the people of the North, or rather the Republican
party, to show why they are not, as a party, en-
titled to the confidence of the American people.
It is charged upon us that we are a sectional party.
And what are the reasons that are urged to show
this? They tell us that we have no Representatives
from southern States upon this floor. Well, sir,
that may be true. But if the question whether
we are or are not a sectional party depends upon
the locality of our Representatives, then I say, if
the time shall come, as I trust it may soon come,
when we shall find Republican Representatives
from slave States occupying seats upon this floor,
of course, to that extent, we shall cease to be sec-
tional; and as the number increases, so our sec-
tionalism will diminish, though our policy remain
the same; and, sir, judged by the same rule, how
long will it be before the Democratic party will
become sectional ? If the fact that we have no Rep-
resentatives from southern States proves us to be
a sectional party, how long, let me inquire, will it
be, in all probability, before the Democratic party
will be subjected to the same charge? Their num-
bers from the North are growing 44 beautifully
less" as the policy of the partyis becoming more
and more thoroughly developed, so that they are
becoming very rapidly a sectional party, upon the
same reasoning that they charge us with being so.
Sir, the member from Wisconsin [Mr. Larra-
bee] urges another reason for regarding the Re-
publican party as sectional and aggressive—one
which I uo not remember to have heard urged
before. After alluding to the habeas corpus act,
personal liberty bills, Wisconsin platforms, &c.,
he adds:
u Look at the fact that a very large proportion of the Chris-
tian ministers who fill the pulpit* of the North are members
of the Republican party; and that they persistently denounce
African slavery as a sin against God and humanity."
Well, this may be a fact, as the member as-
serts. I have not the means to deny it, but shall
have to admit that it may be true; and we must
take all the consequences of the admission, espe-
cially as the member states them to be Christum
ministers."
But they complain further, that we of the North
are radically wrong in opinion upon this ques-
tion of slavery. The gentleman from Alabama
[Mr. Curry] urged this as the foundation of all
the difficulty growing out of this question, they
claiming, on the one hand, that the institution of
slavery is sanctioned by the laws of nature and
the laws of God, while we hold to the contrary;
arid they demand of us that we shall go home and
c'orrect the public opinion of the North on this
subject of tne right or wrong of holding human
beings in bondage.
Sir, we at the North do hold that slavery has
no sanction either in natural law or by Divine
