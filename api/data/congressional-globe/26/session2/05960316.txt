Navy Appropriation Bill—Mr. Wick.
H. of Reps<
the navy, whose trade is fighting, and nui ship
building Now, sir, such are the principles of hu-
man character, that every man imagines h mstif
Solomon's first-born son In the good old times of
our navy, when vessels were bail according to
models furmshnd by naval architects, your frigates.
were crack sailers, and could overtake, or run
away from, an enemy, as circumstance', might re
quire. Bat since you have ^ot this miserable board
at the head ef affans, the new ve  els are ail so
built and the old ones all so repaired, that, with two
or three exceptions, you have not a vessel upon ih"
mountain wave capable of giving successful chase
to an inferior, or of escaping irom a supeuor fence
Tottliug tubs, are they all, in winch are impr sjmed
the gallant spirits of your country, paialyzej by
the remodelling of the modele of these snips by
your wretched navy board, and lendered incapable
of any service but that of surrendering at discrc
tion to an overwhelming force Sir, rub out your
navy board, and reorganize the Navy Departan nt,
so that one single man should be responsible foi
the models of vessels, another for the ma er als
with which they are built, another for their arma-
ments, and so on, ana I will then vote tny rea ona
ble sum for the nav) Responsib luj, individual
responsibility, is the greit spring of human a"tion
Sir, you may send a committee to ascertain who is
responsible for the faulty construct on of any one
of the vessels of your nav>—of the mest sliugí h
creeper among them Your committee will pro e
cute toe examination till tney may In nk they 1 ave
found the lesponsiblt man But put >oui fi iger
on him, and he will not be there He will tell
you, "the board ordered it " Boardr, like corpo-
rations, have no souls—like them, they can nattier
be hanged, d^graeed, nor court martialle I 1 here
4 no section for them
Now, sir. I have a word to say to my honoiable
friend from Ohio, [Mr Mason ] In hisspee h upon
this question, that honorable gentleman again
arraigned the present Admn istration for it* mp-
posed opposition to appropriation for the continu-
ance of the Cumberland road—a subject in leler-
ence to which that honorable gentleman and my-
self, and our respective conslituencies, fee), have
felt, and will continue to feel, the most lively inte
rest. Sir, what are the facts? S) long as Cor-
gress continued to make appropriations for the con-
tinuation of the Cumberland road, and even after
such appropriations were denied, Mi Van Buren
caused to be communicated to Corgress an esti-
mate for the continuation of the road, prepare! by
the Topographical Bureau, sane ioncd by the pu -
per Department having charge of the matter—viz
the Department of War It is true, he ditl not
cauie such estimate lo be suomitied by the Trea-
sury Department, b*eau e ¡he «súmales <i the
Treasury Department are legitimately confintdto
subjects of expéndame arising outot constitutional
obligation or standing laws, t.ermanent in thtnr
nature, and in their woids and *p nt implying per-
petuity The appropna ions for the Cumberland
road have never been of this charac er. On ihe
contrary, they have been made by law^, m letter
and spirit puiportmg to be single and ternpoiary m
their object
And now, sir, I have tins to say to my honorable
friend from Ohio, [VSr Mason J / I ai-e defended
in, speech and with my pen, the course of Mr f an
Buren in reference to this subject If President Har
nson shall 1 ecommend, m decided terms, m n s ci nunl
message, appr opriutmns far the continuation of the
Cumbei land road, oi shf 11 cause an es imate the ejor
to be inserted in the T/easary estimóte, I pledge myself
to go among my constituents and take ba kail that I
have said in defence of Mr Van Buren on that j o n'
And, sir, if my respecte' fnend [Mr Mason]
will publish, along with his speech, that whchl
have now s->id concerning appropriations foi the
Cumberland road, he may send his printer to me
for a ratable proportion of ihe b li, and I will
pay it
A word to my friend from Virginia [Mr Wish, ]
He said that the present Adr/iimstrai on could not
be kicked into a war I th nk I have m°i with this
expression before If I mistake not, it was used
on this floor by an opponent of Mr Madison's ad
ministration, is reference to those times and events
Perhaps ii was then, as now, used by a Virginian.
No, no, no, it came from the vicinity of Hartford
Mr Chairman, what would the honorable member
from Virginia have1*   Would he have
'The ocean into tempest tost
To waft a feather or to drown a fly?"
[Mr Wise    Nt, no.]
Mr Wick Our difficulties with Great Britain
grow out of transactions upon our Northern and
Northeastern bnindanes On the Northern boun-
dary the difficulties had their origin in the action of
in 'iVid mis—mere marauding Surely small diffi-
culties, arising out of sven causes, are better left to
the curative powers if time, and to the mu'ually
pacific explana ions of dip omacy, than committed
to the arbii'ament of arm*, rashly assumed
Tne Maine boundary question is one of more
ditlicu'ty The Britisn Government have raised a
claim to a portion of the territory of a sovereign
Stite By way of asserting this claim, armed de-
mons'ratu n«, upin ihe debateable ground, vere
ipade Entourage 1 by this, timber-jtealers com
menc"<1 op r tions Sir, here is a caase of war-
But the caen, m all prudence, must not pioduce
the effect unti' after reasonable remonstrance wi h,
an 1 pertinacity in, he wrong- oer I would evm
res rt to an umpire before an appeal to arms
In the correspondence between the British Minis-
ter and the head cf the State Department, I see no
lack of decision and diplomat c point on otr muV of
lh" subject Let eveiy mean be used to avoid a
national slruggle for ihiv. bit of pine wood=, and if
all fa I, and ihe shatp conies' must come, I say, go
ahead, Maine, the Moos ers vtill come '
Sir, lh" two past Administrations have asserted
evsry i aiional right, with a spirit wrrth/ of admi-
ration, and I was s0rry to hear my gallant fr^nd
from Virginia s&v that this Administration could
not be kicl ed into a war
Mr Wise explained, observing that he had said,
not that this Administration could not be kicked
m'o a war, but that it could not be kicked mlo a
war with Great Britain, and alleged that Tex-
an officers were permitted t > enlist, openly m
American cities, soldiers for toe Texan service,
against Mexico, while a Unit d States army was
stationed upon the Norlhern frontier to prevent
the interference of our citizens in behalf of Canadian
patriots
Mr Wick I admit that ihe reproach was con-
fined to a war with Great Britain But, sir, the
cases cited by the honorable member from Virginia
are not parallel ¡t is the sfecial duty of ihe Go-
vernment to provide for peace upon our borders
Personal collisions on our Northern frontier, and
Ihe interference of our citizens in Canadian mat-
ters, are calculated to compromit the tntionel
«alety On the other hand, interference of oit cit -
2cns in the contest between Texas and Mexico en
sures our national integrity, Vecause it tend to
rpise up an empire of friends and brothers 1 etween
eur Southern boundary and a people aliens to us
in feeling, policy, religion, and law. Besides, what
be Id hand shall be put forth to stay the onward
march of the Anglo-Saxen race, carrying civiliza-
tion, libeial opinions, and enterprise to tne remota
corners of the earth, baptizing with light nations in
their course i
In ihe progre¿s of the debate upon ihis bill hono-
rable mi mbers opposed to the present Administra-
tion have enarae enzed it as a uymg pouer They
have depicted to our minds its last dying struggles
To ^uch i \iou\d say, m the name of Democratic
principle", ' though we die,)et shall we'ne again "
Respectfully tto would Í offer my advice to the
Oppcsmon, lo be cuary of reproaches at present
t would say lo them, You have kep' us in hot
water a good while Your ingenuity in bringing
forward chaiges has, at times, puzzled even the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
who, in order to answer your que t ors, was bound
to know every thing, and some tbincs besides
You have had your day. You h?ve succeeded
You have made the people believe a portion of
your evidence You will soon be in power The
tables will then be turned upon >ou You will be
questioned m this hall You will be cal'e 1 up
to answer charges m relation to e/ery thing urder
the sua.   And, although you may have the major
part of talent on your side, you will often be puz-
zled Sharp tongues and bold pens will gaff y0H
You cannot bring the good times which * on have
promised Your panaceas for State and individual
indebtedness will fail Money will not grow on
the bushes, nor will your legislation raise prices or
produce demand Mind, I tell you, you will ' as
Burns said of one of his poetical heroes, in a storm
you will "have business on your hands " Even
"Old Tip," all innocent, as he will quite probably
be, m the premises, will be in a 1 sorts of trouble.
I intend to dn him justice But, in bitterness and
gall, will he learn,efrom partisan lrjusttee, that the
White Hou<=e is, at best, a jagg°d palace, that its
pillows arc fills 1 with thoins, instead of down, and
that all w not gold ¡here that glistened m Ogle's eyes
Since I have been here, Mr Chairman, Í have
diucov ied that it is, at nearly all times, perfectly
in order foi p member to "define his posi ion " I
wish to avail rn>se!l of the opportunity, if this be
the proper occasion, and, if it be no', I ask the in-
dulgence of the committee while I discharge that
peremptory du'y prescribed by the lex loci I have
cultivated, of He an indifference as to reputation
because I have seen that much of that which is
ncre acquired grows ou of a waste of t me, and
indu'gence of pergonal rivalry and animal tenden
ties My business nere, nr, is not with individu-
als, but with subject^, principles, and things, I
have been, to a gteat extent, a silent inemler, anl
in the mean time, I am aware that some false
prophet oí oiherhasi, by statements madeat hazard,
oi upon authority of a character too ques íonable
to justify any one in con<m tng him elf thereon,
produced e roneous impre«siors concerning the
hi mble indiv dual now addressing tbe committee.
Even the newspapers have received their lesson
and have pummelled me, in prose and song, as a
renegade, traitor, and all tbit Sir, I was not
elected as a Clay man I can-e not here to follow
in any one's wake—to be no one's ealo-
sist—to take eiceptions to no one m particu-
lar I would be sorry to acknowledge any
man a a "bit better than he ought to be," and
equally far would I be from acknowledging any
man's dangerous greatness by making him the ob-
ject of unceasing attack and misrepresentation I
do profess to be a moderate man—moderate m
feeling and action, but decided in opinion and
principle It was universally known, when I was
elected, that I had voted for Mr. Van Buren, and
had expressed much satisfaction with the general
tone and policy of his Administration But, sir,
there was a kind of manual convention on the'sub-
ject, and it vi a> agreed that I should vote against
thr independent Treasury measure, and about other
things üo as should seem to me right and proper.
And upon that footing I was elected by both parties,
to some good extent. Sir, I have violated no
pledge, as hss been represerted. I have keptfaith
with my constituency I am a Democrat of the Vir-
ginia school—a man of '98 I cannot, for a mo-
mem, ihmk of indulging in a latitudmous construc-
tion of the Co istitution I am for construing its
grant of powers to this central Government strictly
and to the letter, reserving all other powers to the
municipal action cf the States And, sir, I not '
only fear, as the worst of all political evils, the as-
sertion and ex reise of powers by the Federal Go-
vernment not expressly granted by tne charter, but
I go further I ho'd that th  original compact be
tneen the soveieign States of this Confederacy had
for its motive not only the corporate advantage of
the whole, but also the separate advantage of each
State, and lhat if ihe Federal Government should,
in violation of the Constitution, trifle with the
rights ard sovereignty cf ary particular State, and
enact laws of partial effect, oppressive to the inte-
rests or rights of its c tizens, or conferring immu-
nities and benefits upon other States, denied to such
particular Sate, without legitimate reason, or
adopt measures invading rights recognised by the
char er, such particular State, its constituted autho
riti s and cittzers, have a right to recur to original
principles, resist the exercise of the power by the
Federal Government not delegated to it, and do the
best she may Sir, m some respects the Federal
Government is sovere gn—in so far as the Consti-
tution has, made it so    In all other respects the
