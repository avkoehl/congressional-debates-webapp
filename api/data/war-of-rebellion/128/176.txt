I shall give the company every assistance in my power by supplying at cost rations, tools, horses, carts, &amp;c., and under an act of the General Assembly of Virginia I can draft hands for the portion of the road in the State. If Your Excellency can supply hands for the North Carolina part of the road I must ask you to do so, and to inform me when and where they can be delivered to the company. Upon conference with the engineer of the company it has been determined to add 1,900 hands to the force now employed, and to apportion them as follows: Virginia, 650 laborers and 100 mules, and North Carolina, 1,250 laborers and 500 mules. I am informed that the planters of the Roanoke have hands, carts, and mules. If you can prevail upon them to hire them to the company it will enable us to complete the work by March 1. The owners of the hands drafted under the Virginia act received $16 per month, and are taken under the ordinary responsibilities of hirers, except that they are to be paid for if they escape to the enemy. The distance of the road from the scene of operations and the presence of a mounted patrol, which I shall organize to operate along the line, will render the latter risk very small. Can you recommend a suitable person to raise the mounted company for local service as guards and patrols? He should be somewhat acquainted with cavalry service. The company will be composed of non-conscripts and be mustered into the service for six months.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

The acceptance by the President of eight regiments recently organized in this State will for the present lighten the duties of this office and render unnecessary the appointment of more than five additional enrolling officers for the entire State. If officers of the line or staff are not detailed for this service, and appointments of citizens are to be made, I trust the Department will confide those appointments to the commandant of the camp of instruction. I venture the suggestion, because I hear of recommendations of most unworthy persons being sent to the Secretary of War. I know every man in the State who is fitted for the duties, and can select the best. The drill-masters now
