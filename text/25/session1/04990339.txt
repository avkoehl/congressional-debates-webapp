Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Mams.
H. of Reps.
forlpassitig to the third reading the bill to postpone the pay
merit of die fourth instalment of the deposite with the States,
prescribed by the act of 23d June, 1S36, is to be taken in con
neition with his subsequent speech, on the 14th of Octobei, on
the\bill to adjust the balances remaining due from the late de
posse banks, to be found at p 265 Tue postponement bill, as it
hadipassed the Senate, postponed the payment of th.e fourth in
stalment "till further piovisionby law " Mr Pjckens, in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, had moved to strike
outjthe words "further provision by law," and insert the first
da# of January, 1839, to which Mr Adams had moved, as a
jrfrther amendment, to add the following " And all balances
#public moneys due from all the deposite banks are hereby
ipropi rated to the said payment, and no part of them shall be
ibplied to any other payment v. hatever, and if the portion of
(he said balances due by the said deposite banks cannot be re
¿Wved in time to pay the whole of the said deposite with the
States, heieby made payable on the first of Januaiy, 1839, then
the instalment ol debt iiom the late Bank of the United States,
for the sto-k in that institution held by the United *tates, paya
hl^in October, 1838, is hereby appropriated, to make up any
insufficiency of the sums recovered from the deposite banks to
complete the said payment of the fourth instalment of the (lepo
site with the States '
Both these amendments had beet), by small majorities, re
jected m Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
á|d the bill had been reported, without amendment, to the
House, wheie they hail been eve IwJed from consideration by

Mr ADAMS e qire-^ed the hope that it was competent for

/he had introduced m Committee of the Whole, but which had
J been cut off by the pievious question

Mr   Ada"WS pioceeüed    He wouid be veiy buef in the íe
marks he should addiess to the liou=e    fie said he had come
/ to his seat at this special session of Congress, fully aware of
'   the difficulties under which the Government was placed, and no
less sensible of the embarrassments which afflicted the people
of the country    He had felt inclined to go f i the mea&ure now
before the House, as a means of relieving the Administration
fiomembairasbmcnt, being wilhrg to go foi the ic lef of the Go
vernment, and theiehy to lelieve, mdnectly, the people, whe
ther the Government should propose any measure lor the di
rect íel ef u£ the people oi not    But when he had come to
consider ihe bill, as it came from the Senate, he had been forced
to the  convicnon  that  whatever relief it would affoid the
Government would be obtained at the expense of the people,
it being, in substance, a bid to rare revenue    And what was
the effect of the bill?   A bill, bearing on its face one thing, and
doing another'   Putportmg to postpone the opeiation of an act
of Congress iestonn0 to the people a poition oi their own
money, and, m leality   going to repeal that act1   As the bill
had passed the Ser ate there was no lurther payment or depo
site to be made of the pronoition of the suipli¿s revenue now
due to the States witnsui íurther legislation    It was, to all
intents and puipo ea apioposaltorejieal theactof June 1836
This was its g eat object    If us intention v> a" not express! d,
and appaient upon its lace, the effect of it woul i be a deeep

might think the postponement of its operation reasonable, were
the time to which it was postponed fixed ard ceitam    liut
theie lb new   no such corlainty upon the face of the bill, its
operation is to be put off to a da e as far distant as wl it the
old Romans called the Calendas Groycas, or, asihclieuch
proveib terms it, "the week of the three Phuisdayb'      r^ow
the ai te idment of the gentleman from Poutli Caí iht i (Mr
Pickens) piopo es to postpone the operation oí the act until the
1st of January, 1830, instead of until the further action o   Con
gre*s    lie, fu one   was willing to take the bul with such an
amendment, but theie must be one othei ptovision—an assur
anee that there shall be no more postponement, and that the
sum thus appropriated shall be applied to that puipose, and to
no other
Mr A had called tins a bill to laise revenue, and so it was

said that it, with us companions of the same general sys-
tem, had onginateu at the Treasmy Every one of these
billshadeveivmark and feature of such an origin, they weie
all, beyond question, drawn up and prepared at the 1 leasuiy
Department'   The chairman of the Commit ee of Ways and
Means (Mr Cambreleng) has told the House that the Senate
and House bills, on the same subjects, were not identical m all
respects, and what was the difference? Mr A believed that
the Hoase bill proposed the issne of Treasury notes to the
amount only of $12,000,000, while the Senate bill proposed
only $10,000,000 He would confess that he had much rather see
the difference on the other side He weuld lather find the
House disposed to give loss than more The whole thing, as
managed thus lar, looked like a little "experiment" The
House were to be asked by the Treasury through the Senate
for $10,000,000, with the expectation that (he House, becoming
familiarized to the idea of so large an issue, would consent to
throw m the additional two millions as a mere trifle of more
or less                                                                "
Mr Cambrele\o rose to explain When the bill was re
ported in the Senate, it was reported m blank In the House
bdljtheie was an additional appropriation,foi the Florida war,
which was not included in that of the Senate of course, and
there weie other differences between the two bills
Mr Adams said he thought he had ^een another bill separate
from this bill of twelve of millions, and asking sixteen hundred
thousand dotlai s more    He did not understand—
Mr Cambreleng Don't you understand sn'* Ihe othei
is the bill appi opi lating the money proposed to be raised by
¡VMS
Mr Adams t.aid he was happy to receive this explanation
fi om the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and
would be glad to hear lurther fiom him, why, aftei the enoi
mousappropnations made last spring lor this vei y object, it
had become already neeessary toappropuate lorthe seivice of
this same year nearly two millions moie He expiesstd the
hopethatMr Pickens would accept his amendment as a modi
ficationof his own
Mr PioKEt.  said he would willirHj do so, but foi the Intel
clause, pledginethe faith of the UmtulS ales th it the Coi _iess
will provide for the payment of the money in T-inu li v   1 nT>
Mr Adams obsei ved that the proportion was divisible, md
that if, alter the House had made the appiopi .uion, they
think it best not to pledge the faith of the Govei ninent to can y
it into effect, they could easily reject the latter part ot the pio
position All he desired was to say to ihc people, we have
promised to pay over lo you this sum we cannot do II now foi
want of that sum to pay over but we pledge you oui faith that
we will elo so ' and certainly fifteen months will be found
abundantly sufficient for the perfoimance of such a Pledge
Yet, if theie was all tins reluctance to the adoption of this pait
of the proposition, Mi A said he was willing to take the
amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina, modified
by the adoption of Ins oa n (Mi Kdame s) without the lattei
clause All he piofessed to want was an assurance Out the
people shall not be paltered with any longti with delusive) 10

Mr A then argued briefly that, with the amendmen s pio
posed, this bill ceased to wear the aspect of a bill to raise re

several gentlemen on this floor have complained of, in the íe-
Kort of the Secretary of the Treasury, and he (Mr A ) had
ad been much perplexed to obtain a glimpse of its meaning-.
What, then, was the meaning of this circumlocution about
"warrants, to the amount oí two hundred thousand dollar^
heretofore drawn, but not yet paid, though payable? Why,
Mr Speaker, all that wmple means, that those warrants ot
drafts of the Seci etary of the Treasm y wer§ protested* That's
all1 [Laugh ] The drafts-were for specie—"hard currency,"
" mint diops,"-—and they were drawn on (hose hoards of specie
accumulated by the "Specie circular " But the specie had
gone when the drafts arrived, and so the drafts were "notyet
paid, though payable''   [Laugh ]
Sn, (said Mr A ) gi\ e me leave to say a word or two on the
alleged unintelligibility of the Senetary of the Treasury I
certainly cannot but feel a great degree of compassion for him,
considering the necessity he was under of making a report w

stance of the repoit of tne Secretaiy of the Treasury may be
summed up m those few words
Mr A said he had another observation to make A gentle-
man fiom South Carolina (Mi Thompson) had ©bserved that
it was a soit ot umloim opeiation of this confederate Govern-
ment that all the money of tins nation ' flowed to the North"*
[Mi Thompson here hdid, "I did say eo ") Theie is (said Mr
A ) an English poet, who has said,
"Ask where's the Noith7—at Yoik, 'tis on the Tweed "
INow, su, suppose youiself at Charleston, South Caiolma,
ynu ask, "WheitJs tlio North?" With this maxim of thegen-
tlem m from SkhuIi Caiolma, and ins system of geography, and
the anvwtr you would íeceive must be—at Chai leston, South
Caiolma, the Nuitli         is Mobile, Alabama, the Isorth     .   is
Natchez, Mississippi the North—is New Orleans, Louisiana.
1 oi these are l;¡Ni>uh' at Chaileston,—if you assume that the
money of the country is flowing to the North 1 have named
a single instance— the Hank of Alabamu, at Mobile—where
there is a deposite of public money to the amount of more
than a million of dolíais It flowed thither, I suppose, by
the aif of the lai famed Specie ciuular," in "mint drops" and
"hard eunency ' fvow, what is that million worth? The
amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina, and my
own added to it, will secure to t hit banK the use of that monev
