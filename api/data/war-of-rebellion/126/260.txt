In closing this report I cannot but express to the Quartermaster- General my high appreciation of the uniform kindness and courtesy he has extended toward me in the discharge of my official duties, and I feel grateful to that Providence who chooses the bounds of our habitations for having assigned me, during the prevalence of the great slave holders" rebellion, to a department of mammoth proportions and of great responsibility, under the guidance and direction of an officer of distinguished ability, with whom I have had such delightful personal and official intercourse.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES A. EKIN,

Bvt. Brigadier General, in Charge First Division, Q. M. G. O.

Many claims entered in the column of "rejected and suspended" have been rejected for want of evidence or accountability for the property, and may come before the department again; hence the impossibility of discriminating between "rejected" and 'suspended."

Many of the claims entered in the column of "not acted on" are under investigation.

Respectfully submitted.
