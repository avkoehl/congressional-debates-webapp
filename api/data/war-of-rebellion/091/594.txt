Captain F. C. BROWN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Brigade:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that heavy firing was heard between Burke's and Fairfax Stations during the hours of 5 and 6 p. m. to-day. A negro living in that vicinity came to this camp and told me he thought at first it was artillery firing; finally he concluded that it was heavy musketry. I did not receive any other information; but knowing that Mosby has been reported in the district above Fairfax Court-House I thought it might be some of his work.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. SCHNEIDER,

Captain, Sixteenth New York Volunteer Cavalry, Comdg. Stockade.
