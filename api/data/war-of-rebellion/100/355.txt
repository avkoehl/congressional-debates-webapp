GREENSBOROUGH, April 30, 1865.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of North Carolina, Raleigh:

GENERAL: I have the just received your letter of yesterday and the supplemtal terms. I respectfully ask a modification of the first article. You have an undoubted right to make the disposition of the field transportation. I propse that it be loaned to the men who use it. The agricultural of the country will be as much promoted by that mode as any other distribution. I will add that I understood that General Sherman and yourself both looked to such an arrangement, and so explained to officers with whom I have conversed. I sign the papers, but hope that you will make the modification, immaterial, I think, to you, but important to me.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSON,

General, C. S. Army.

General JOHNSTON, Greensborough:

I will modify the first article of the supplemantary terms as you request. It will not be necessary for your detachments to be collected to give their obligations. The certificates of commanding officers will be all the evidence necessary. I believe General Hartsuff understands it so. If not, please show him this dispatch.
