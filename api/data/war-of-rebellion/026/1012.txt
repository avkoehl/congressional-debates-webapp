the one that comes by Black Jack Church and into the Washington road at Taft's. From the upper road the captain reports that he saw Whitford, who was near the enemy as late as 2 o'clock in the morning. They were then is possession of Swift Creek and were cutting and working a good deal. Whitford represent this force at 4,000. Should they advance I will make the main fight 3 miles from town, the best position this side of the Swift Creek road, but still much in favor of the enemy. General Pettigrew is at Adams' Bridge. I will endeavor to keep you advised.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JUNIUS DANIEL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Greenville, N. C., April 21, 1863-5.30 p. m.

Brigadier General J. J. PETTIGREW, Commanding, &c.;

GENERAL: There will be no necessity of your marching here to-night. I have not yet heard from the force I sent in the direction of Washington, or I should have heard from them. My information from Swift Creek is that they still occupy it and are at work upon something. It regard to attacking them I do not see how we can do so unless we attack the force at Swift Creek, or those at Washington should come out again.

I will write you again when I get reports from below.

Very respectfully,

JUNIUS DANIEL,

Brigadier-General.
