Mr. WILSON asked, and by unanimous
cousent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 634) relating to brevets in the Army of
the United States; which was read twice by
its title.
Mr. WILSON. If there be no objection, I
should like to have the bill put upon its pas-
sage.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It authorizes the President,
with the advice and consent of the Senate, to
confer brevet rank on officers in the Army of
the United States on account of gallant, meri-
torious, or faithful conduct in the volunteer
service prior to their appointment in the Army
of the United States.

Mr. CRESWELL. The bill to regulate the
disposition of fines, penalties, and forfeitures
was passed in full Senate on a careful consider-
ation, and it has been returned by the House
of Representatives with certain amendments,
which are merely verbal. I ask that those
amendments be now concurred in.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the Senate
take a recess until nine o'clock in the morn-
ing, leaving that matter as the unfinished busi-
ness.
Mr. CRESWELL. We may as well take
up the bill and dispose of the amendments;
it will take but a few minutes.
Mr. SHERMAN. I submit a motion that
the Senate take a recess until nine o'clock.
Mr. CRESWELL. I hope the Senator from
Ohio will not insist upon his motion until this
bill shall be taken up. The amendments of
the House are merely verbal.

l veyed, asked to be discharged from their fur-
; ther consideration, inasmuch as when the deed
I is executed and the title approved by the At-

The report was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on Mil-

charged from the further consideration of the
following bills; which was agreed to, and they
were ordered to lie on the table :
A bill (S. No. Ill) to provide for the na-

A bill (S. No. 540) to amend an act entitled

Mr. MORRILL, from the Committee on the

district jail.
Mr. MORRILL. I am further instructed
by the Committee on the District of Columbia,
to whom was referred the joint resolution (H.
R. No. 304) in relation to the erection of a
jail in the District of Columbia, to report it
back without amendment, and recommend its
passage. I ask for its present consideration,
and I will state to the Senate what the exigency
seems to be. Last session the erection of a
jail was authorized and its location left to the
discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.
The House Committee on the District of Co-
lumbia have an apprehension, from facts re-
ported to them, that this jail is being located
at a very inconvenient and unsuitable place,
inconvenient in that its distance is a mile or a
mile and a half from the court-house, unsuit-
able in that it is a very low, wet piece of
ground. This resolution contemplates a reex-
amination of that subject by engineers at the
head of whom is to be Quartermaster General
Meigs, and the postponement of the subject
until a report from that commission at the next
session. I hope the Senate will consent to the
passage of the resolution.
By unanimous consent the joint resolution
(H. R. No. 304) in relation to the erection of
a jail in the District of Columbia was consid-
ered as in Committee of the Whole. It pro-
vides that no money shall be paid from the
Treasury toward the erection of a new jail for
the District of Columbia under the act of July
28, 1866, unless the letting of the contract
shall be delayed until perfect plans shall have
been completed and approved by a board of
three disinterested and competent engineers
and architects, of whom Quartermaster Gen-
eral Meigs and A. B. Mullet, architect of the
Treasury Department, shall be two ; nor unless
the letting of the contract shall have been open
to fair and equal competition on reasonable
notice printed in two leading newspapers in
the city of Washington after such approval of
the new and perfected plans, and the Secretary
of the Interior is authorized and directed to
select a new site.
Mr. GRIMES. I desire to inquire of the
chairman of the Committee on the District of
Columbia where it has been proposed to erect
this jail, and where it would be erected if
some legislation was not had?
Mr. MORRILL. Just at the junction of K
street west and the boundary of the city.
Mr. GRIMES. This subject was under con-
sideration some years ago when I had the
honor to be a member of the Committee on the
District of Columbia. I think the present
chairman of the committee was also a member
at that time. The Senate agreed to appropri-
ate ยง100,000 for the purpose of aiding in the
erection of a jail, butthat appropriation failed
in the House of Representatives. While the
subject was under consideration then the com-
mittee gave considerable attention to it and
examined the proposed sites for the jail. I
believe they were unanimous in the opinion
that the present location of the jail was very
inappropriate; and that it was very desirable
that when a new jail should be constructed it
should not be upon Judiciary square nor the
jail square, and thef were also unanimous in
the opinion that the present structure was
wholly unadapted to the purpose for which it
is used and is a disgrace to the country, and
that a new jail ought to be built. They were
equally unanimous, I think, that it ought to be
built upon a public square belonging to t.he
United States, a piece of reserved ground to
the east of the Capitol, and in the neighbor-
hood, I think, of the Congressional burying
ground; and if it is proposed to locate it at
the place stated by the chairman of the Com-
mittee on the District of Columbia, I trust
this joint resolution will not pass until there
can be a further examination as to sites. The
place where it is proposed to put it, according
to his statement, is certainly not the best
adapted to the purpose, especially in view of
the fact that the Government now owns a place
that is well adapted to the purpose.
The joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate, ordered to a third reading, read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. GRIMES. I move that the Senate take
a recess for half an hour.
The motion was agreed to ; and at the ex-
piration of half an hour the President pro
tempore resumed the chair.

Mr. MORRILL. I move to take up House
bill No. 1234, and I will say that it is a very
small affair any way. The corporators of the
proposed company are gentlemen of the very
highest respectability, and tiiey seem very bo-
