prevail, to offer the second part of the resolution * „
a distinct resolution     To «Inch
Mr BUCHANAN replied certainly He could
have no objection to place it in the same situation
in w hich he had found it, without, however, there-
by pledging himself to support all the principles
which it contained
Mr WEBSTER said he could not concur in
this resolution I do not know (said he) any mat-
ter of fact, or any ground of argument, on which
this affirmation of plighted laith can be sustained
I see nothing by which Conj ress has tied up its
nands, either ditectly or indirectly, so as to put it?
clear constitutional power beyond the exercise of
its own discretion I ha\ e carefully examined the
acts of cession by the States, the act of Gonsress,
the proceedings and history of the time , and fnnd
nothing to lead me to doubt that it was the inten-
tion of all parties to leave this, like othei subjects
belonging to the legislation tor the ceded territory,
entirely to th# discretion and wisdom of Congress
The words of the Constitution are cleai and plain
None could be clearer or plainer Congress, bj
that instrument, has poner to exeicise exclusue
juiisliciion o ei the ced d territory, in all cases
wiiatsoetei The acts 11 cession contain no hmi
tation, condition, oi qualification whatever, except
that, out of abundant oiution, there is inserted i
jnomso that nothing in the acts contained should
be constiued to vest in the United State any light
of property m the soil so as to aftect the rights oi
individuals therein, othei wise than as such indivi-
duals might themselves translertheu nghtof soil to
the United States The acts of cession declare that
the tract of country "is for ever ceded and relin-
quished to Congress and to the Government oi the
United States, m full and absolute light and exelu-
sue jurisdiction, as well of soil as of persons re-
siding or to íeside therein, pursuant to the tenoi
and effect of the 8th section of the 1st aiticle of the
Constitution of the United States "
Now, that section to which reference is thus ex-
pressly made in these deeds of cession, dc< lares
that Congress shall have power " to exercise exelu
sive legislation, in all ca«es whatsoevei, over such
District, not exceeding ten miles squate, is may, by
cession nf particnlai States and the acceptance < t
Congress, become the seat of Gotemment of tin
United States "
Nothing, theieforc, as it seems to me, can he
clearer than that the Slates making the cession ex
pected Congress to exeioise ovei the District pie-
cisely that power, and neither more noi less, which
the Constitution had conferred upon it I do not
know ho-v the provision, or the intention, either of
the Constitution m granting the power, or of the
States in malting the cession, could be expressed in
a mauner more absolutely free from all doubt or
ambiguity.
I see, therefoie, nothing in the act of cession,
and nothing in the Constitution, and nothing m the
history of this transaction, and nothing jn any othei
transaction, implying any limitation upon the au-
thonty of Congtess
If the assertion contained in this resolution Ix
true, a very strange result, as it seems to me, mu t
follow The íesolution affirms that the faith of
Congiess is pledged indefinitely It makes no li-
mitation of time or circumstance If this be so,
then it is an obligation that binds for e\ er, as much
as if it were one of the prohibitions of the Consti-
tution itself And at all times hereafter, even when
m theeouise of their history, availing themselve
of «vents, or changing their \ lews of policy, the
States themselves should make provisions for the
emancipation of then slaves, in this District, ne-
vertheless, the existing stale ol things could not be
changed It does leally seem to me, that if this
resolution, in its terms, be true, though slavery m
every other part of the world should be abolished,
yet m the metropolis of this great Republic it is es-
tablished in perpetuity Tins appears to me the
result of the doctrine of plighted faith, as stated in
the resolution
Mr. BUCHANAN said, that m his opinion, the
Senatoi from Massachusetts (Mr Wmster) had
not placed the question upon its true grounds He
had entirely mistaken the meaning of the resolu
{¡.on, if lie (Mr. B ) understood it correctly.   He
would ask, did any human being suppose that the
States of Virginia and Maryland would have
evei thought of ceding this District to the United
States, if they had imagined that Congiess would
convert those ten miles square, in the veiy heart of
their territory, mto an asylum for their fugitive
slaves, and a spot froi.i whence the peace and safe-
ty of both were to be constantly endangered? Thev
never would have made the cession, had any such
idea existed It is true that no erptess faith was
pledged in. the cession, because no such apprehen-
sion was then entertained If there had been,
does any man doubt but that they would have in-
sisted upon an express stipulation against such an
alarming danger? If (said Mr 1!} I freely grant
to you a valuable possession, could yon, as an
honorable an/I honest man, think you had a light
to wrest this giant from its original put pose, and
convert it into an instiument of my destruction?
If you know that the gift never would have been
made by me, had I supposed you were capable of
using it in such a manner, vou are under the
strongest moral obligation not to pervert it to suth
a purpose It is true you may have the constitu-
tional powei to abolish slaveiy m this Distnet, but
w juld it not be a \ íol Hum of implied I nth, under
all the cucumstai ces, to exeicisp this power' 1
think it would, I feel that u would, and therefore
sh ill vote that it would.
Again, said Mi B no infeienoe can be drawn
fr im the language of the íesolution, that its friends
intend that slavery shall exist m the District, aftei
it has been abolished in the surrounding States In
thus supposing, the Senator has misapprehended
the terms of the resolution. Abolish slavery in
Viiguua and Maryland, (said Mr. B ) and it will
no longer, it can no longer, exist in this District
The people of these States had been making rapid
strides towaids the accomplishment of this object,
until they were auested m their career b) the abo-
lition excitement, and the proteedings of the abo-
lition societies This resolution presented the very
point ol the question on which he was willing to
st-ind or to fall It contemplated the existence of
sla\ cry here, so long as u should continue to exist
in the <¡m rounding States, but not a day longei It
contained the very prim iple for which he had al-
wiys tontended, that slavery lure md slavery Hint
must share the same fate He thus undeistood the
íesolution, and with this understanding he had
given it his support
Mr WEBSTER The words of the resolution
will speak for themselves They requue no com-
ment They express an unlimited plighted iatth
The honorable member will so see, if he will look
at those words The gentleman asks whethei
those who made the cession could have expected
that Congress would ever have exeicised such a
power? To this, I answer that I see no reason to
doubt that the parties to the cession were as wil-
ling to leave this as to leave other powers to the
discretion of Cnngress T see not the slightest evi-
dence of any especial feir, or any. especial care, or
concern, on the part of the ceding Sutes, in regard
to this particular piit of the jurisdiction ceded to
Congress And, I think, I can ask on the other
side, a very itnportint question for the considera-
tion of the gtntlemn himself, and foi that r>f the
Senate and the country, and that is, would Con
gross have accepted the «¡ssion with any such re-
straint upon its constitutional power, eithei express
oi understood to be implied"! I think not Looking
back to the state of things then existing, and espe-
cially to what Congress had done so recently be-
fore, when it accepted the cession of the Northwest-
tern Territory, I entertain no doubt whatever that
Congress would ha\e lefused the cession if offered
with any condition or understanding that its con-
stitutional authority to exercise exclusive legisla-
tion over the District in all cases whatsoever should
be abridged
The Senate will observe that I am «peaking
solely to the point of plighted faith. Upon other
parts of the resolution, and upon many other things
connected with it, I have said nothing I only re-
sist the imposition, at this time, of new obliga-
tions, or a new prohibition, not to be found, as I
think, either in the Constitution or my act of Go-
vernment.   I have sajd nothing on the expediency
of abolition, immediate or gradual, or the reasons
which ought to weigh with Congress should that
question be proposed I can well conceive, I
think, what would be- a natural and fair mode of
reasoning on such an occasion
When it is said, for instance, by way of argu-
ment, that Congress, although it have the power,
ought not to take a lead in the business of Aboli-
tion, considering that Ihe interest which the United
States have in the whole subject is; vastly less than
that which the States have in it, I can undei-stand
the propriety and force of the observation. It is,
as far ai it goes, a pertinent and appropriate ar-
gumeftt/and I shall always be ready to give it the
full weight belonging to it When U is argued
that, in a case' '«¡d vital to the States, the States
themselves should be allowed to maintain, "their
own policy, and that the Government of the United
States ought not to do any thing which shall, direct-
ly or indirectly, shake or disturb that policy, this is
a line of policy which I can understand, for I have
always not only admitted, but insisted, that slave-
ry, within the States, is a subject belonging abso-
lutely and exclusively to the States themselves
But the present is not an attempt to exhibit any
such course of reasoning as this The attempt is
to s( t upa pledge of the public faith to do the same
office, as a constitutional prohibition, in terms,
would do, that is, to set up a direct bar, preclud-
ing all exercise of the discretion of Congress over
the subject It has been often ¡said, in this debate,
audi believe it is true, that a decided majority of
the Senate do believe that Congress has a clear
constitutional power over slavery in this District
But while this constitutional right is admitted, it is
at the same moment attempted to be effectually
counteracted, overthrown, and done away With by
theaflumation of plighted faith, as "asserted in- the
íesolution befoie us
Now, I have already said I know nathing to sup-
port this affirmation Neithei in the acts of cession,
nor m the act of Congress accepting the District,
nor in any other document, history, publication, or
tiansaction, do I know a single fart or suggestion,
supporting this pioposition, or tending to support
it Nor has any gentl«man,so far as I know, point-
ed out, or attempted to poinl out, any such fact,
document, transaction, or other evidence All is
left to the general and repeated statement, that
such a conditioh mustsh&ve bean intended by the
States Of all this I see no proof whatever. I see
no evidence of any desire <5n ihe part Of the Stales
thus to limit the power of Congress, or thus to re-
quire a pledge agauist its exercise And, indeed,
if this were made out, the intention of Gongress, as
well as that of the States, must be inquired into
Nothing short of a cleai and manifest intention of
both parties, -proved by proper evidence, can
amount to plighted faith. The expectation, or in-
tent, of one party, if exeited, founded on something
not provided for nor hinted at m the transaction it-
self, cannot plight the faith of the other party.
In short, I am altogether unable to see any
ground lor supposing that either party to the ces-
sion had any mental reservation, any unexpressed
expectation, or relied on any implied, but unmen-
tioned and unsuggesled pledge, whatever, By the
Constitution, if a district should be eeded tc> it for
the seat of Go\ eminent, Congress was to have a
right, m express terms, to exercise exclusive legis-
lation, tn all cases whatsoever. The cession was
made and accepted, m pursuance of this power.
Both parties knew well what they were dmn 
Both parties knew that by the cession the States
surrendered all jurisdiction, and Congress acquired
all jurisdiction, and this is the whole transaction
As to any provision m the aets of cession stipu-
lating for the secunty of property, there is none,
except only what I have* already observed—this
condition, that no right of intoStaals m the soil
should be construed to be tgaasferied, but only the
jurisdiction. But- no dou hfc ajl rights of property
ought to be duly respected by Congress and aH
other legislatures          ,                           '
And since the-subject of compensation:*? toe
