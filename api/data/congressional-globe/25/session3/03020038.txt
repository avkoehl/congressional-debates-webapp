yard there is easy of approach to oar own vessels,
under the guidance of the Delawaie pilots, ¡t is
inaccessible to foreigners who are unacquainted
with the navigation of that liver Ships can be
building and íepairing theieatall times,m perfect
safety and seounty fiom foreign depredations,
which, in time of war, might be of momentous
interest to our navy Over and above that, a
dock can be constructed at Philadelphia with less
cost than at Brooklyn Its location is more cen-
tral between the two docks at Chailestown and
Gosport, and it is within a few houis ride of this
city
Mr P. said he was induced to throw out these
suggestions without any antagonist feehng to waids
the claim of New Yoik, ot any other place, for a
<lry-dock, but, if the subjects of dry docks must
now be examined, he thought his colleague had
done well to offer the amendment, in oider that
we may show that the claims of the Philadelphia
yard are entitled to the consideration and respect
of this House
Sir, my notion, long since, has been that there
should be a dock at each of the piincipal yards
but if we are to have but one at this time, wheie
is the argument, where is the reason, wheie is the
report from any source, or which shows the
advantages of Biooklyn over Philadelphia ? The
Secretary of the Wavy leaves that matter open
He says " M some point," without designating
either, particulaily fen, his not sufficient to give
one yard picference over anothei, to say that it
is admitted by ail that a dry dock is wanting at
Brooklyn, we want the reasons that-,nall show
this House and the country that any navy-yaid
has claims over that at Philadelphia
Considering the course which this debate seems
likely to take, 1 feel much inclined to the idea sug
gested by my fuend from Massachusetts, [Mr
Pabmenter,] that the whole matter ¡should be
postponed until a critical examination be made as
to the sites, and necessity of more docks than we
have at present, we could then meet the subject
more fully, and decide more coriectly     I shall,
however, cheerfully vote foi the amendment ol
fered by my colleague, and feel under obligation*
to him for his  having so promptly brought the
subject to the notice ot the House
Mr POlIERsaid the amendment of his col
league was direct and positive, ai d expressed, in
plain language, what he desned to be at Ihe bill
to which it was des ie<i to be attached appiopnited
§100,000 toimpiovethe navy yaid at Brooklyn,
and for ¡he necUo/i <f a diy dock A few thousand
dollars would mi| love and enlarge ti e navy yaid,
bat all aie awate that it would cost five bundled
thousand to build a di y dock ihe minor | r< j"ct
takes the first rlace in the position foi aj pio¡ ua
Won, and the mi|or comeo in b/ way of appendix
to it He woi hi íespeufully ask the houoinblt
gentleman from New 'Voik [Mi Oambri i i jo]
whether the erection ot a diy dork it Brooklyn
was or was not a new woil , oi had theie ever
been one dodar expended m pieparation ioi the

which no Pennsji-aman will ever admit, then,
sir, Phiiadel ih a sidiuls on an equahtvwith Biook
Jyn or "New Yoik The memory of tnePhi'adel-
p1 la navy yard is identified witn the glory of ihe
N wv The vessels built there equal in models of
beauty, and m snpeiionty of sailing, any vessels
built in f-is oí fi y ' tl pr portion of the world
The mechanics  in that city equal in  skill and
science the ship builders in any portm the Union
In cheapness of building and economy in labor no
point on the sea board can successfully compete
with  Philadelphia     In  advantages in obtaining
materials for the construction of vessels of war
the  port of Philadelphia is admiraoly situated
Why, then, should there not be a dry dock con-
nected  with the navy-yard at that city?   The
great ship Pennsylvania was built at the navy-
yard in that city, and was removed from the point
where ouiit to be finished, because there was no
drj dock     I recollect the buist of dissatisfaction
thi oughout Pennsylvania at the circumstance, and
the anxiety expi essed that this noble ship should !
be perfected, and leady to sail on her element, m I
the State from whence she derived her name   The
question is one vital to the existence of the navy-,
yard at Philadelphia—a navy yard at which the ¡
lust ship of war was built in this Union     Mark i
the prediction'   If vessels cannot be finished at i
Philadelphia, the United States will cease to build
at that port     What Pennsylvaman could stand |
silently by and see the navy yard at Philadelphia i
abandoned ? that navy-yaid, so identified with the
naval glory of the nation and the pride of Penn   J
sylval la     At no point on  the sea board could a
di y dock be situated wheie it would be safei fiom
the aggiession of a maritime incursion      ihe nav-
igation of the Delaware, aided as it is by steam
towing ships, can be ascended with ease     Why,
then, should not an appropriation be made fortne
election of a dry dock, connected with tne navy-
yard at Philadelphia5
Mr B1DDLE would say one word on a point
of fact The gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr
Paraie'vter] had said that one dry dock was
sufficient, and that we had more than one already
That was his argument against the bill and the
amendment
Mr PARMENTER explained     He had said
that the chairman ot the Boaid of Navy Commis
sioners had given it as his opinion that, in time of
peice, one diy dock would be sufficient
Mi   RLED     In what year had he said so'
Mr PARMENTER     In 1825
Mr    B1DDLE resumed      We had two diy
docks now, and  they were not told how  many
more would be needed     The bill proposed a diy
dock at Biooklyn, as an extension of that yard—
as a convenient appendage to it     Rut why would
not one be an  equally convenient appendage to
the navy yaid  at  Phi] uielphia?   As that yird
now htood, aiter a ship had been built there she
must be sent to Not folk oi   to Boston to be fin

[Mi   Hoinaw] had promised tne friends of the
amendment that, if they would withdiaw it now,

the puiest gentlemen of the South w re startled
a'     But let not gentlemen look  at tagne piom
ibes, but at the nstuial workings of the human
neaitwhen the ob|ec sougnt had been attained
Why lifd the gentleman from New Yoik rebuked
the gentl-man  fiom  Mnssachusetts, [Mr   Pir
ii VTEit,]   ind accused  him of e lfish   motives

proper time, nor could ne see \ hy it should  be
postponed, unless for some sin ster pc-pose not
avowed
Mr DAWSON said he had listened to the de
bate with attention, and had watched the workings
of interest on the different gentlemen who had
taken part in it It was with reluctance he wsi
compelled to see how these things were managed
We of the South (said Mr E> ,) remain silent at
our seats when questions of great interest to the
country are agitated, and why? Because when
ever we have asked our equal share with the resf
of the Union, we have always failed i have, from
time to time, applied here even for a navy yard
at any port south of Noifolk and how often have
I failed' Just as often as I have asked And
why is this? Because we have not the talent at
getting up the necessary arrangements Is that it?
We eie told tne objects we desire are proper, but
tne chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means tells us there is not a dollar m the Treas-
uiy Thus 1 find that those who are more modest
get nothing Here there is a navy-yard and a dry-
dock at Gosport, a navy yard here at Washing-
ton, another at Portsmouth, another at New York,
a navy yard and dry-dock at Boston Well, sir,
now look at the South, ay, en, along the whole
coast of the Atlantic and round into the Gulf of
Mexico, and where is the protection for our com
meice fiom any establishment of the United States'
They will send us ships, says the gentleman from
Massachusetts, whenever we need them Yes, sir,
and when we need aid and ask for it, pei haps that
will be the moment when none can be sent When
we want any repairs done, the vessels must be
sent round to Norfolk or to Boston What other
Government in the civilized world ever pursued
such a policy? Go to England, how many dry-
docks has she? More, by one, than we have
But the gentleman says she has two or three dry
docks at the same navy yard Well, sir, if thai
is necessary, we can do the tame, and then the
I mechanics and all the conveniences will be together
¡ on the spot, and there will not be the difficulty
nowcomplained of But this is not the point Yon
I are now asked to appiopnate for New York and
Philadelphia $100 000 apiece How much do you
| usually appropriate for the increase of the navy
in one year? and how many new vessels do you
need in the same time ? I will venture to predict
that if we aieto have foui dry docks, as proposed,
they wih not have a vessel apiece in any one year
I shall oppose both the bi'l and amendment Not
because Í am opposed to either city, I would vote
the money with gi eat pleasure, if I honestly be-
lieved it was required, but I cannot believe these
dry docks necessary If a new one is necessary,
,t must be south of the Chesapeake Bay
I call unon this House, (said Mr D ,) instead
of establishing all the navy yaids and building ail
the diy docks at tne North, to do rn act of justice
to the South, and give us an appropriation for our
protection Sjppose an enemy should attack us,
wheie aie we to look foi aid? " Government will
send us vessels, " Ay ' but where is a navy-yard ?
Í here it none south of Norfolk Yet we are to
give tne North new navy yards and new dry docks
Before you pom out your money from the Treas-
ury,—but 1 forget, the gentleman from New York
tells us there is none theie to poui out—well, sir,
when \ou pledge the counti y to further appropna
tions of money for objects of this kind, do it for
the South, not because it is the South, but because
it is a defenseless portion of this Union Last
session, my friend [Mr Legare] asked for the
es abhshment of only a navy yard at Charleston,
the gieat commercial emporium of the South, but
he could get none I asked one for the whole
coast of Georgia, and the reply I got was " We
will send you help whenever you need it " Sir,
this laiguage is becoming unpleasant in our ears
If we belong to the Government, we have our
lights, and they should be respected, but they
never will be, so long as we lend our aid to put d
navy yard and a dry dock in every port of the
Nuith More dry docks are unnecessaiy, but, if
any aie built, they should be at the South Let
lis treit all jus Jy, before we do over-much foi any
ore poit
The gentleman from New York [Mr lion -
ia\] seems to mi'mfest an extraordinary soiici
tude to get t! e loor—for what? Not for a navy-
yard, sr, no1 tí at she has go' but for a dry deck
n addition to a navy yard We ask only fo* a
navy yard at the South, for what New Yoik has
