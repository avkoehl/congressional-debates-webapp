skirmishers also, in falling back, had several of their wounded bayoneted, by order of one the enemy's officers.

The enemy's entrenchments and batteries appeared to be in rear of a creek called Bull run. The batteries on the extreme right of their line were on high ground,a nd fired over the heads of their infantry in front. At night we fell back to Centreville for water and rations, and this morning have again occupied our ground upon the hill in front of the enemy, they being in large force, and having their pickets and skirmishers in the woods and in front of them, as yesterday. I have the honor also to inclose a statement of our loss incident to this affair.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. B. RICHARDSON,

Colonel, Commanding Fourth Brigade, First Division.
