HDQRS. PROV. ARMY CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA,Charleston, S. C., April 9, 1861.

Colonel J. J. PETTIGREW, Commanding Sullivan's Island, S. C.:

SIR: You were informed last night that you were to hold your regiment in readiness for any change of station that circumstances might dictate. This order should not preclude you from maintaining all your present arrangements for the defense of Sullivan's Island, for it is impossible to state now when you may be called upon to move from your present position. I may even have to strengthen the present forces on that island.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

P. S. - Have you put that flat-boat in position, as already directed, in the Sullivan Creek?

G. T. B.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 9, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston:

The messenger speaks doubtless my authority. He gives the promised notice to Governor Pickens. Diplomacy has failed. The sword must now preserve our independence. Our gallant countrymen will do their duty.

MARTIN J. CRAWFORD.

MONTGOMERY, April 10, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston:

If you have no doubt of the authorized character of the agent who communicated to you the intention of the Washington Government to supply Fort Sumter by force you will at once demand its evacuation, and if this is refused proceed, in such manner as you may determine, to reduce it. Answer.

L. P. WALKER.

CHARLESTON, April 10, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

The demand will be made to-morrow at 12 o'clock.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Brigadier-General.

MONTGOMERY, April 10, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston:

Unless there are special reasons connected with your own condition, it is considered proper that you should make the demand at an earlier hour.

L. P. WALKER.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 10, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

The reasons are special for 12 o'clock.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
