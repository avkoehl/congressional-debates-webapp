This officer allowed his command to neglect the most ordinary rules of police, and gives in excuse that he was not aware of their condition because he had not been to see them.

Sanborn reports Freeman on Spring River, fifteen miles below Salem, Ark. Rumored at Pilot Knob that a portion of Shelby's command is at Doniphan. Take best care of what you have. Look after the trains going to Springfield. I will send re-enforcement soon. I expect Seventh Kansas from Memphis. Keep me posted.
