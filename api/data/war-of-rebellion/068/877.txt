Assistant Adjutant-General.

(To division commanders.)
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,Near Myers' House, May 18, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have investigated the report sent to you. It originated with the Maryland Brigade. I can discover nothing but cavalry vedettes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,Left of line of battle, near Myers' House, May 18, 1864.

GENERAL: The enemy has opened a battery which has an oblique fire on the batteries on my right. His fire is not repeated, although an angle of one of the limbers has been broken. The skirmish line has advanced a considerable distance without finding the enemy's pickets. It is going on slowly until they are found. The enemy can be seen near the Gate at which we saw them yesterday. At the Ny River the batteries will open more frequently.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD.

Brigadier-General
HEADQUARTERS PENNSYLVANIA RESERVES,THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

May 18, 1864.

[Captain MARVIN:]

CAPTAIN: The enemy made a charge upon the Bucktails, who were holding the crest of a ridge in advance of my picket-line on the right, at 9 o'clock to-night, and forced them back. Part of the Eighty-third New York, who had relieved the picket-line, fell back also. Colonel Coulter, to whose brigade they belonged, went to the front to establish the line, when he was wounded, the ball striking a rib in the region of the left breast and going round under the skin. The picket-line has been re-enforced and re-established. The enemy are entrenching the crest of the ridge from which they drove the picket. As I reported to the general, the value of this ridge was, that it gave the Rifles control of a battery of the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
