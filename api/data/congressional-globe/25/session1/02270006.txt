SPEECH OF MR. HAMER,
Oi Ohio
In the House of Rep esenlatities, Sepiemhei 25,1837—
On the bill to postpene the depo ite oF the fourth
instalment oí tl e pub ic monpy vv uh the States,
under the act of June 23, 1836
Mr Spfaker I have anxiously destied to avo d
speaking upon this subject The ext aordtnary
circumstances under which ive have been assem-
bled, seem, to my mind, to require action, ra'her
than debate Wnatever we do, to be effectual,
should be done piomp.ly, without unnecessary de-
lay I have beeu disinclined, therefore, to protract
this discussion Besides, for some days past, my
health has been such as to disqualify me, m a good
degree, from engaging m the contest that has been
progiessing in the Hous  But the course which
the debate has takpn, as well as my own position,
being a member of the Committee of Ways and
Means, seems to require that I should express my
opinions upon the important topics introduced by
gentlemen, and upon the principal measures which
have been presented by our committte to the con-
sideration of the House.
It is true, as has been remarked by several gen-
tlemcj, that the contrast which the presenf condi-
tion of the country exhibits to thit which w e occu-
pied bat a few months since, is of an extraordinary
character It is but a short time since our Tiea-
sury was full and overflowing Comphmts «ere
heard from all quarters of the country, that we had
so much money in the Treasuiy of the Union, that
no one knew what to do with it The bmeful
influence of such vast sums of money upon our
legislation, leading to profusion and extravagance
in the public expenditures, was deprecated by al'
Schemes vvihout number were d°vised to get rid
of it, in some matner that would benefit the coun-
try Now, sir, on being assembled here b/ pr >cla-
mation of the Chief Magistiate, we are tol I that
not only are the people of the country m a state of
great pecuniary embarrassment, but that the Trea-
sury of the United States is in a state of bank-
ruptcy1
Instead of proceeding, at once, to provide reme-
dies for this remarkable state of things, if remedies
can be found, within the range of the constitution-
al powers conferred upon Congress, t wuuld seem,
from the remarks that have fallen fren gentlemen,
that our great object is to ascertain i< ho created ail
this distress and embaí rassment II remed is
forgotten, vvlp'st we occunv omselves, m ascer'am-
mg who is the culprit, to what Ongin these difficul-
ties are to be traced, or, in other words, which
party is to be held responsible for this catastrophe1
Instead of attempting to relieve the Government
and the people, we stop to talk about ' lions" and
"tigers," about "fixes" and 'hares,' of "Executive
patronage" and 'Legislative seivilit}," about a
"Star in the East," the "dark clouds" that ovei-
shadow the foi tunes of the administration, and the
"sunshine" that is breaking in upon the prospects
of the opposition We stop tu talk of Piesid ntial
elections that have been, and that are to be, and of
candidates thai aie now, or ma, hereafter make
their appearance in the feld Is this a course die
tated by wisdom1 Is it íequircd by patriotism1 It
may seem so to some gentlemen, but in mv judg
ment, h is wholly incompatible with the duties
which devolve upon a patriotic and enlightened
statesman
In private life, we have many mies and maxims
that die applicable to public affairs. When I see
my friend in distress, it is not the part of fnend«hip
to stop and inquire minutely into all the cncmi-
stances, to see whetl er his difficulties may not hav e
been occasioned, in some degiec, bv Ins own im-
prudence or w ant of fores ght The fust thing a
hue fnend does is to reach out H s hc<nd He first
relieves the other from his embarrassments and
dangers, and inquires into th-> causes afterwards
The same rule should be applied to eur coumi > if
she is really distressed, everj true-hearted man will
come to her relief The particular causes which
nave contributed to produce her troubles are wholly
immateiial When she raises her imce and de-
mands assistance, that son who disobejs the call is
unworthy of his country
But before we advance a single step towards
amelioration, the opposition in tms House seem de
ttr mined to convince the country that the policy of
th° las'and present administrations has produced
the existing evús of which we have now to com-
plain This is to be done by furious declamation
Sir it is verv easy to decli m The cant phrase 
of ' Goths," Vandais," Cormorants," Destructives,"
"Loco focos," " third-rate men in power," "slaves
to Cvecut v<  rtietation " can be pronounced without
e hei in el¡ee' or pan i sm A parrot could be
tmght o reppa* taeni as well as a demagogue
f*nmin*>li n ¿nJ iter mini ion nrove nothing, but
they usually i id cate either a rial cause, or weak-
ness and mil ice in tho e w io aie its advocates
And it may do ver, well (or those who have not
the capaeitv to drover ihe rea1 causes of our p- -
s nt difficulties, or the honesty to avow them, to at-
tribu e every misfortune which has befallen the
country to the policj of the demociatic partv
We l.ave'-cen repeated!; told dunng this deba'e,
that ail our embarrassments might be traced to the
veto upon the bill «chartering .he United States
Bank, to the removal of the public dopusjtes from
its vrults, and to the Specie circular It is a sound
rule in philosophy, that m attempting to account
for a known effect, we must always select a cause
that is adeq late to produce t Nov, it the oppo-
sition newspapers cm be believed, and I admit
that tney are generally verv bad authority, but in
this instance they aie corroborated by the papers
on our side—if they speak the tiuth, then these
embairassments m the commercial community are
not confined to the United States They have
overrun England, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Turitey, the East Indies, and the empire of
China The whole civilized world has been
more or Uss affected b> them Can rm man in
I is senses! elieve thit uV icmoval of th' deoosites
from the United States Bank has c^ivulsed thiee
quarters of the globe1 Is it possible tnat ihe mtie
transier of a lew millions of public money from
one bank to another, or to several others, could
have produced an enure ¡evolution in the monetaiy
affans of the w crld1 As well might it be pretended
that a pebble thiown into the Potomac had pro-
duced a mighty tempest m the At'antic, which had
overwhelmed whole fleets m its progress, and sent
thousands of human bemgs to a w atcv grav e1 Is
it ncf suinge that gen 'emen belon * rg to a party
who oh in to p ssess almost all tie \ isdon m the
conmuriv, sho ¡id hav selected ¡>o t iiiing an
event and he'd it i p to ihe people as the cause oí
all the c mfisior, embarrassment, and dis'ress of
tne present time1
Sir, the real causes are far diffeient from those
to which I havp referred They are to be found
m the over-trading, speculations, and extrav agance
of the times The causes have not been limited to
our couniy rlone They have pervaded the
whoie commercial w oild It is one of those extra-
ordmau conjunctures in human affans, produced
by a combination ot circumstances, and ldceable,
rrmoíeíj to principles inherent in t e constitution of
man At paiticulai peuods a mania seems to pre-
va I upon seme one or upon si miar subjects, that
sweeps ot er the whole face of the earth Human
affans ebb and flo v like the tides of the ocan
Hence his*or> is divided into ages and epochs, and
we have the ages of conquest and of inventions,
the ages ot discovery ard adventure, and of the re-
vival of letters We have periods of almost
univeisal wai and of ilmos  anivei al peace The
remote cause may be entnelj 1 - ond our reach, but
the facv is indisputable
The present ebb m commeic al affans has been
preceded by a lemarkaVe flow of prosperity An
mercase oí riches only stimulated to gieatei nsks,
and whetted the appetite for more exorbitant pro-
fits A resale s anxietj and burn ng desne to amass
laigf fortunes, m a shoit time aid b> a few ope-
rations, plunged eve v one nto wild and extiava-
gant speculations, and 1 e w iv e rolled on, ace m u-
latmg and increasing is ' progresse 1, u itn in a
moment of fancied secunty ltwassuddenh bioken
upon a rock, and its scatteied part cles fell back
into the bosom of the gieat deep from whence it
had risen The same scenes are witnessed at least
once in every generation  sometimes ottener    But
in such matters, the succeeding generation learn
no wisdom from the experience of the past. They
a'wajs fancy they see a dietvncltoit between the
cases, they go on, engage in the saine schemes of
speculation, and in a short time find themselves
plunged m the same difficulties and misfortunes
So far as this country is concerned, we know
there were some local causes which, have contri-
buted to bring upon us our present disasters When
ihe bank charter had been vetoed, and the deposites
removed when all saw that the bank mnst die,
there was a general impression abroad m the com-
munity, that other bai k capital and circulation
ought to be provided by the State Governments, to
supply the vacuum which would be occasioned by
the withdrawal of the United Slates Bank from
business Accordingly, manv of the existing banks
had th 'ir capital increased, and a great numtier
of new binks weie chaiteied by tne Stale Legisla-
tures In the vears 1834 and 1833 the bank capi-
tal was increased from about twi hundred millions
to tu o hundred and fifty-one millions of dollars,-the
amount of bank paper m circulation was increased
from ninety-five millions to one hundred and forty
millions of dollars, and the loans and discounts
dunng the same period were increased from three
hundred and tvventv-four millions to fbiir hundred
andiiftv-se en millions of dolíais This extraor-
dinary increase of capital, circulation, and loans,
within so shoit a penod, changed the face of the
whole countrv The credit svoteni w as expanded to
such a degree as to affect eveiy man s business and
estate The value of labor and property was raised
in proportion to the mcrea e of the circulat.ng me-
dium, and to ihe facility with which money was
obtained The country wore an appearance of
prosper tj, such as the nation had seldom, if ever,
witnessed at any former penod Most of this
prosperity w as teal, but ¡here tn< much of t delu-
sive Ifmencou'dhavebeensatisfiedwi treasona-
ble distension of the credit system, they v ould have
done very well An impulse w^s g ven to bu  ne s
and enterprise, that exer.ed a most salutiry influ-
ence upon the country, but they continued to blow,
until, at last, the bubble buist, and we have seen
the consequences

cations, it appe is that a majority of the opposition,
aided by a ,ma'l minority of the democratic mem-

been passed there during the last three or lour
