APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
125
41st Cong. ...3d Sess.
Fifteenth Amendment-
Voorhees.
Ho. op Reps,
down that the virtue and the intelligence of
the people could alone sustain it; and when-
ever we proclaim that the people are not to
be trusted, that it is necessary to have force
bills in their midst, that Federal satraps have
to g ) among them with bayonets in their hands,
that informers have to stand at the polls with
the Army and the Navy at their backs, to regu-
late the canvass, to inspect the ballot as it
goes in, and after it is in, and as it comes out,
it will be a proclamation that our Government
has failed, that its foundations are false, that
their virtue and their intelligence are myths
and mockeries and do not exist. That is what
your bill does here. It accomplishes this fell
purpose. It lays hold upon the foundations
of the Republic. It drags them to their down-
fall. It declares an absolute loss of faith in
the people. Sir, I knew when you entered
upon your career of violence in prostrating the
southern States by your misnamed reconstruc-
tion that it would not stop there. I knew
when the sky darkened in that quarter that it
would darken likewise in this. I knew that
usurpation could not be confiued to any one
section of the country. I knew, that despot-
ism had no boundaries when once begun save
the outside limits of the Union. I knew that
when you overthrew and chained a portion of
the States you would seek to overthrow and
chain all the others. The unlawful exercise of
power is the tiger's taste of blood. It cannot
be appeased. It grows more insatiate upon
its unnatural and horrible repast. It ravens
in fierce hunger and thirst upon each new
draught from the veins of its bleeding and
dying victims. The lust has not been quenched
in your hearts by its unbridled indulgence.
You crushed the States of the South after
their people had surrendered; you invaded
their voting precincts; you regulated all their
elections with the iron hand of the military";
you elected such persons as you desired. There
is nothing more to be done in that quarter.
Your ruthless work is finished under a southern
sky. And now, unlike the great Alexander,
who wept because there were no more worlds
to conquer, you have found new and inviting
fields of conquest over your own countrymen ;
and this bill declares the war and orders the
ravaging and devastating march, a march over
the ark of the covenant of a free Constitution
and over the downtrodden forms of American
freemen. You turn away for awhile from your
southern captive. You turn the edge of the
sword now to the States of the North. You
point your cannon toward Saratoga and Mon-
mouth and Brandywine and Bunker Hill.
What are some of the leading features of
this bill of nineteen sections? My time is too
short for more than a glance. You provide
for the appointment of two persons to super-
vise at each voting precinct the registration
of all the voters in all the cities and towns of
over twenty thousand inhabitants in the sev-
eral States. Who ever heard of such an out-
rage on local liberty in the good old days now
gone, and, I am afraid, gone forever? You
say these two officials shall be of different
Eolitical parties. What care I? If they were
oth of my own party I would denounce the
principle just the same. Sir, I despise an
argument based upon such an idea. I spurn
it; 1 loathe it; it is unworthy the Halls of
the national Legislature. I cast it from me
as false and pernicious.
Another section of the bill provides that the
United States marshals shall have certain high
and almost unlimited powers; they shall
appoint as many deputy marshals as they may
desire, either for the public good or for mali-
cious oppression. There is no limit in this
respect. He may organize companies, regi-
ments, and battalions of deputies. No words
of limitation contract his powers. He makes
his selections also to suit himself. No appoint-
ments from different parties are here provided
for. The execution of this terrible bill rests
in the hands of the marshal and his deputies,
and they will all belong to the party in power.
This is a cunning device. There is a decep-
tive show of fairness in regard to the appoint-
ment of the supervisors, but where the real
power to grind and oppress is lodged none but
the adherents of usurpation are trusted for a
moment by this bill.
And what does the execution and enforce-
ment of this measure involve ? Who can con-
template it with calmness ? By section twelve
of this monstrous revolution—it is nothing
less—provision is made that a marshal, or his,
general deputies, or his special deputies, or
either one of them, shall, upon his own judg-
ment, if he thinks or pretends to think that
he has been interfered with or opposed in the
execution of his duty, call the commander of
the nearest military post to his aid to enforce
this bill with United States troops. I appeal
to the geutleman from Ohio—I appeal to him
personally, for he can\iot want to destroy his
country. I do him that justice. A long ser-
vice in this Hall has dissipated many preju-
dices. I am ready and anxious to accord to
all good intentions. I do not desire to be
harsh in my judgment upon any one. 1
therefore appeal, in all candor and kindness,
to the gentleman from Ohio in the face and
hearing of the country, tell me what you mean
when such a section as this is written ; where
power to command the Army and Navy is
given not merely to a United States marshal,
but to one of his deputies; to one of the low,
crawling creatures such as were raked up in
the vile purlieus of the city of New York last
fall and appointed to act in that capacity? I
challenge the attention of this House, I chal-
lenge denial of the assertion that under this
law any one of those bawds of politics who
may be appointed a deputy marshal can call
upon the commander of the military post near-
est him and compel his services with all the
troops at his command; for this bill says that
the officer thus called upon shall obey or incur
the wrath of heavy penalties. There is no
exemption by reason of rank. The tallest
heads shall bow at the mandate of the deputy
marshal. The plume of the greatest hero will
trail in the dust at the feet of the bar-room and
back-alley politician dressed in authority by
this wretched bill. William T. Sherman must
obey; Philip Sheridan must obey; George H.
Thomas, if alive, would have to obey; Winfield
S. Hancock must bend his proud head to some
poor, slimy creature born in infamy and reared
in corruption, who, as a deputy, might see fit
to call upon him for military assistance with
which to carry an election by force. Gentle-
men, if you can stand that, we can. Little by
little you are giving us the advantage before
the country. Upon measures of this kind you
are alienating your honest followers. It was
once said, "Oh, that mine enemy would write
a book!" We may well say, ''Oh, that our
enemy will continue such legislation as this,
until the mighty and colossal structure that
once reared its insolent head to the very heav-
ens and overshadowed all the land, known by
the name of the Republican party, shall totter
to its fall, forever 1" It is not for me to com-
plain, except in behalf of the public good. I
do not complain in the spirit of party. My
party rejoices and prospers in your follies and
yourcrimes. You cannot undermine the strong
battlements of your party more effectually than
by such gigantic, heedless, and unnecessary
outrages as are contemplated by this bill. The
people are resenting your lawlessness day by
day, and soon will turn and rend your political
fabric to pieces. It requires no eye of pro-
phetic light to foresee this doom,' unless the
downfall of liberty itself is at hand.
Sir, I had no idea of engaging in this dis-
cussion until it was about to open to-day. I
thereupon sent a page to the Superintendent
of the Census Bureau, asking him to send me
a list of the cities of the United States con-
taining a population of over twenty thousand.
I have that list here. I give it as it was given
to me:
Population of cities of the United States of twenty
thousand and upward.

Those cities are seventy in number; and this
bill makes every one of them a military post
whenever a United States deputy marshal
desires the presence of troops at one of their
elections. There are five such cities in the
State of Ohio of which the gentleman who has
charge of this bill [Mr. Bingham] is one of
the Representatives. At Cincinnati, Dayton,
Columbus, Cleveland, and Toledo troops can,
at the high and sublime command of a deputy
marshal, be brought across the waters of the
Ohio river from Newport barracks to surround
the polls. When will the people awake to
their danger? How much longer will the
delusive cry of "All is well" lull them into
a false security ? Must they behold the gleam-
ing bayonets at their throats on the day of
election before they will believe in the open
and shameless advances of tyranny? Must
they see the cannon trained upon the ballot-
box before they will rush to its rescue? Must
shot and shell lie piled up at the voting pre-
cincts before the voter will recognize an assault
