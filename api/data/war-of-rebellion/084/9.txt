Colonel J. H. FORD,

Pleasant Hill:

The commanding general is of the opinion that to send scouts with the stage regularly invites attacks from the guerrillas that will lead to an unnecessary loss of men, and that they should not be sent except in extreme cases. Besides that, it requires too many troops to protect it.
