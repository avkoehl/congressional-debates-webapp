State of Georgia.
SPEECH OF HON. O. P. MORTON,
OF INDIANA,
In the Senate of the United States,
April 14, 1870.
The Senate having under consideration the bill
(H. R. No. 1335) to admit the State of Georgia to rep-
resentation in the Congress of the United States-
Mr. MORTON said.;
Mr. President : This is the anniversary of
the assassination of Mr. Lincoln. Five years
ago to-day lie fell by the hands of an assassin,
perhaps the original Kuklux whose evil exam-
ple is now being imitated in various States in
the South, producing a condition of thing3
■which imperatively demands the consideration
of the Senate and the country. But, Mr. Pres-
ident, there are some preliminary matters which
I must first dispose of before proceeding to the
discussion of the main subject.
The main issue upon the Georgia bill now is
what is called the Bingham amendment—a pro-
vision the principal feature of which is to re-
quire that the election for members of the Legis-
lature in Georgia shall take place this coming
fall. The other provisions in the bill were con-
tained in the bills for the admission of Virginia,
Mississippi, and Texas, and I had supposed
were not really in discussion until the distin-
guished Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Carpen-
ter] the other day chose to argue the question
all over.
This Bingham amendment, requiring an elec-
tion next fall, is favored upon several grounds
which are in direct conflict with each other.
The first ground is that the Georgia constitu-
tion requires that the election shall take place
next fall. Those who support the amendment
upon that ground seem to be unconscious that
they are advocating a power in Congress more
dangerous to what are called State rights than
those who claim to support the other provisions
of the bill under what is called the guarantee
clause. They assume that Congress has a right
in advance to give a construction to the con-
stitution of a State, and to provide in advance
that the Legislature of a State, after it shall
have been admitted, aftenthe State government
shall be in full operation, shall not do a par-
ticular act. This position assumes on the part
of Congress a supreme judicial character to
construe in advance a State constitution, and
to provide by law that the State government,
after the full admission of the State, shall not
give that constitution a different construction.
I am somewhat surprised that the leaders
of the Democratic party sustain this constitu-
tional position, inasmuch as it is more destruc-
tive to State rights than any other ; but it only
proves that the ultra advocates of State rights
are willing to tolerate an aggression on the
part of Congress when that aggression threat-
ens to be'in favor of the Democratic party
instead of being in favor of the Union party.
Now, Mr. President, there are those who
assume that under the Georgia constitution
the Legislature - have a right to put off the
election one, two, or three years, and that in
consequence of that it is the duty, and Con-
gress has the power to interfere to prevent the
Legislature of Georgia from exercising a power
which they concede it possesses; but they in-
volve themselves in this contradiction: they
insist that Congress has the power to overrule
the constitution of Georgia so far as to require
the election to be held next fall, and thus
promptly put the State into the hands of the
rebels, but has no power to require an elec-
tion to be held two years hence, to give a loyal
State government in the mean time the power
to reorganize and regenerate the State and
secure protection to the loyal men of that
State.
I will not upon this occasion go over the
argument I have made heretofore on the Geor-
gia question. I have argued heretofore that
there was no legal Legislature until the pres-
ent one was organized in the month of January
last, and that consequently the legislative term
began from the time of the first legal organiza-
tion, and the members had two years from that
time. I have argued further, that whether this
was so or not Congress in the exercise of its
supreme power of reconstruction had the right,
in view of the public necessities or of general
convenience, to fix the time when the term of
the State officers should begin, or, in other
words, to fix the date when the new State gov-
ernment should take its start.
I want to say right here that the Bingham
amendment, so called, (and it bears the name
of a distinguished and honored Republican, but
that does not change its chax-acter,) is in the
inlerestof the Democratic party, is against the
interest of the Union party in the South and
throughout the country, and that it is so uni-
versally understood by the Union men in Geor-
gia and by the rebels in Georgia. The Demo-
cratic party in the entire South, and so far as
I know in the entire country, support the Bing-
ham amendment unanimously. The Repub-
lican party in Georgia, otherwise called the
Union party, the loyal party, oppose the Bing-
ham amendment unanimously. I believe the
entire Republican party of the South, who un-
derstand the situation better than we do in the
North, oppose the Bingham amendment.
It may be said this is not a very good argu-
ment. I think there is something in it. I think
itis worth agood many of the fine-drawn, very
technical, constitutional scruples that have beeu
brought forward in this case ; and I must say
that these fine constitutional scruples, some-
what remarkably and unfortunately, all result
in favor of the Democratic party of the South
and against the Union men of the South. In
