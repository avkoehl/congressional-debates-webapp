Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 29, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A dispatch* of 7.30 [7.35] p. m. from General Wright reports his arrival at Reams' Station without meeting the enemy or hearing of General Wilson, except from citizens, who says he was fighting the enemy's cavalry successfully till about 4 p. m., when they were re-enforced by infantry and forced back. Since Wright's dispatch was received, the accompanying dispatch+ has been received from Kautz. It shows a very unfortunate state of affairs, and makes me anxious for Wilson. Kautz has been directed to communicate with Wright and endeavor to ascertain the whereabouts of Wilson. Wright is ordered to remain at Reams', and, in conjunction with Sheridan, whom I hope will join Wright to-night, and Kautz, endeavor to ascertain Wilson's position and extricate him from his difficult position. When Wilson is secure I shall withdraw Wright and the cavalry and get the latter into condition for further operations.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
