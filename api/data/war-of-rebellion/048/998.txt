here and have carried out all the orders given me. The enemy hold Thoroughfare Gap in such force that I can't drive them without trouble. I have reported already that I drove the enemy through Bristoe Station and found him in force at Thoroughfare. His pickets are in my front, and I think he will retire without making a fight against infantry.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel C. Ross Smith, Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,October 19, 1863 - 10:30 a.m.

COLONEL: My main body is at Bristoe Station. I send 2 prisoners to the rear, who report that the rebel infantry has gone to the Rappahannock River and Culpeper. Stuart and Lee have gone to Gainesville. The railroad in this country is a complete wreck - bridges, culverts, ties, and many rails destroyed completely. The enemy's infantry worked hard on the road several days since. The destruction is thorough. Part of the rebel cavalry (Hampton's) is reported toward Catlett's, as also another brigade.

Very respectfully,

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel C. Ross Smith, Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps.

Report of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick, U. S. Army, commanding Third Cavalry Division. *
HDQRS. THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,October 18, 1863 - 7 p.m.

GENERAL: I have received your order to advance to the Warrenton pike at 3:30 p.m. My trains were moving on the pike at 4:30 p.m. My skirmishers became engaged with those of the enemy at 5 p.m. a short distance beyond Groveton; also on the road leading from New Market to Gainesville. My line of skirmishers is extended along the edge of the woods just this side, and I have halted for the night. The enemy had used no artillery; in fact, the country would prevent its use. The country about Gainesville is favorable for cavalry.

It would be well, if the major-general commanding the corps desires me to advance in the morning, to have Brigadier-General Merritt, who, I understand, is now in the neighborhood of Bristoe Station, move on Gainesville from that direction. My scouts have just come in from Aldie and Hopewell Gap. They report that Stuart's cavalry, from 800 to 1,000 strong, left Aldie this afternoon for Hay Market. No infantry has been seen near Hopewell Gap or Aldie. The lieutenant commanding the scouting party says he distinctly heard heavy firing from the direction of Harper's Ferry.

Very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.

General Pleasonton.
