Commanding Cavalry:

My command is now in motion for Newton by the way of Hillsborough. Maxwell reported to-night, and so has Ferguson.

Major-General.

MORTON, MISS.,

February 8, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel THOMAS M. JACK:

Enemy's forces so overwhelming will be compelled to fall back to Newton by way of the Hillsborough road. Stop all trains with re-enforcements at that place.

Major-General.

MORTON, MISS.,

February 8, 1864 - 9.30 p. m.

General POLK,

Lake:

I am now moving toward Newton by the way of Hillsborough. I think it best for you to return to Newton with the train. I feared the enemy would take the Homewood road and get in advance of us. This force being so much larger than ours I determined to fall back in the direction of Newton. The enemy is all this side of Jackson. Some of our cavalry in that place. Any more re-enforcements should be ordered so as to meet them. I think they will push forward to Enterprise or Meridian.

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.

MORTON, February 8, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Meridian:

Lee not yet come. Just received a dispatch from him at 11 a. m. to-day at Smith's Ferry. Reports the enemy either to go to Meridian or to bear to the right and go to Mobile. Fears that their cavalry will make for the bridges on the Mobile road. He has ordered Ferguson's brigade here to cover my front, and, if necessary, protect the Mobile road. Has ordered Ross to join him. General Jackson, he says, is making for Brandon. Lee says he will lie between Brandon and Morton. Lee [received dispatch] from Major Steede, commanding cavalry regiment, reporting strength of enemy 62 pieces of artillery, 35,000 infantry, and 12,000 cavalry. Left Jackson, Sherman in command.

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.
