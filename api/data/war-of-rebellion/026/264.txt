HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, April 11, 1863.

Brigadier-General KING, Yorktown:

I have directed a stern-wheel steamer for West to be sent up if one can be had.

If West does not waste his ammunition he ought to do five times as much damage to the enemy as he receives. I cannot understand how the 500 got below Fort Magruder. Did they cross the James River?

Do all you can to supply West and to encourage him and his men to fight.

Major-General.

Major-General.

We have taken 10 prisoners, one of them an officer, who corroborates the rumor of yesterday that Wise issued orders to take forts at all hazards.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General KEYES, Fort Monroe.

YORKTOWN, April 12, 1863-11.35 a. m.

Major Chamberlain, who has just come in from Fort Magruder, brings me a verbal communication from Colonel West to the effect that he thinks his position insecure and the line too extended to be successfully defended. From prisoners and deserters he learns that Wise, who is in command of the enemy's force, has 4,000 infantry, 500 or 600 cavalry and 6 or 8 pieces of artillery; that his orders from Richmond are to
