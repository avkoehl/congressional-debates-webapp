HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864-4 p. m.

Major DAVIS:

Assistant Adjutant-General:

With the news of Early's advance, my thin lines, and the extended works I am constructing, it would be inexpedient to take any more troops from here, so that if Lieutenant-General Grant did not specially designate a regiment from this corps, you will order Major-General Gibbon to send a regiment to Fort Powhatan temporarily. Otherwise I will have to take fatigue details from line.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, Va., September 5, 1864.

Major R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: A report has been received that the enemy is massing in General Terry's front; under the circumstances the major-general commanding does not deem it advisable to withdraw the Twenty-second Colored Regiment from the line to-night, but directs that your order a regiment of General Gibbon's command to be sent to Fort Powhatan temporarily. The Twenty-second Regiment will be sent to relieve it as soon as it can safely be withdrawn.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
