Major-General HALLECK:

The Third Iowa should stop at Memphis. I will be at Chattanooga May 1, but will leave General Webster and other staff officers at Nashville. All well here.

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, April 26, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have not lost a moment's time in the shipment of mules. The Missouri trains had to come into Saint Louis from the frontier posts, and if boats are not detained on Harpeth Shoals a large number will arrive by the first of the month. From other points they should be arriving daily. Wherever it was possible to obtain a mule it has been procured. I have no orders yet from Washington to join you here. Have telegraphed several times.

Do you desire me to move on the 2nd May, or to concentrate my troops in readiness to move on that date?

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.
