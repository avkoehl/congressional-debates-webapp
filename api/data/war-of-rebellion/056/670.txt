HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE, Missionary Ridge, November 8, 1863.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET,Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding instructs me to say to you that General Wheeler has his artillery with him.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Tyner's Station, November 8, 1863.

Colonel GEORGE W. BRENT,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: We have not received our supply trains as yet, nor have we heard of their going up the country. I understood from the general that preparations were already made or would be made for all our wants. I hope that we may not be delayed on account of want of transportation for our supplies. I suppose that we shall not be able to make any movements without such transportation. I doubt whether we can more than subsist ourselves in the country, doing nothing else, with our present limited and inefficient transportation.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
