REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OP THE
TREASURY.
Treasury Department,
September 5, 1837.
In pursuance of the duty of this department to
submit to Congress, at each session, the state of the
finances, and in conformity with the request of the
President, that such other fiscal matters should, on
this occasion, be presented, as appear to require
early legislation, the undersigned has the horioi to
offer the following report
I    CONDITION OF THE TREASURY
It is not proposed to give all the particulars, relating
to the receipts and expenditures, "which usually ac-
company an annual statement Bat nn exposition
of them, under the customary general heads, so far
as they have been ascertained, for the first hall of
the year, is subjoined.
Brief estimates for the other half are made, and
such explanations added, as seem necessary to show
with e'earness not only the condition of the Trea-
sury at this time, but its probable state for the resi-
due of the jear
According to the Treasurer's running account,
ihe whole amount of available money in the Trea-
sury on the 1st of January, 1837, applicable to pub-
lic purposes, was $42,468,859 97. Prom that sum,
there were on that day íeserved §5,000,000, and
the balance, being $37,468,859 97, was, under the
provisions of the pet of June 23, 1836, to be placed
in deposite with the States It is ascertained that
$27,063,430 80ofitha\e smce been actually re-
ceived by them
The amount of that portion of the first three in-
stalments, the payment of which has not yet been
acknowledged, though transfers were seasonably
ssued for it, is $1,165,575 18 The remainder is
$9,367,214 98, and is the sum which -was designed
for the fourth instalment of deposites with the States
on the 1st of October next. The amount reserved
n the Treasury on the 1st of January has since
been increased, by íetnrns subsequently rsceived
from banks., to the sum of $6,670,137 52, and
which, uf course, could not then be ascertained or
taken into computation.
RECEIPT-.
The receipts m the first half of the jear, depo-
sited in the banks, and paid on drafts by collectors
and receivers, so far as> ascertained, have been
Prom customs   -                                   $7,234,451
From lands       -           -           -             5,303,731
And fiom miscellaneous sources                512,263
To these maybe added about $600,000 v,hiGb
remained m the hands oi receivers, and $50,000 m
those of collectors, subject to draft AH these
make the aggregate for that half of the jear
§13,187,182 If no further postponement be grant-
ed on duty bonds, it is estimated that the whole re-
ceipts for the last half of the year, from all sources,
will be about $9,500,000, which would make them,
as ascertained and estimated for the whole j ear,
$22,637,182 Em if the brief extension of the pie-
sent postponement, brought into view hereafter,
and favorably regaided, be directed by Congress,
the receipts will probabh be about $7,000,000,
while, by a postponement of the v. hole to another
year, they will not be likely to exceed $4,500,000
Looking at our whole revenue theiefore, irom
all quarters, it appears that the balance of money
reserved at the commencement o; the yeai, as
finally asceitamed to be $6,670,137, with the
actual receipts for the first half at $> 13,187,182, and
those now anticipated for the last half of it at
$7,000,000, will constitute an aggregate of
$26,867,419.
EXPENDITURES.
The expenditures during the first half of the} ear
were, for
Civil, miscellaneous, and foreign
intercourse       -           -           -   $2,812,540 40
Military, including pensions        -   10,603,301 49
Naval
Public debt
Making an aggregate of
•    3,297,149 69
20,832 75
■$16,733,884 33
The expenditures required to meet existing ap-
propriations, during the last half of the jear, will,
as computed, equal the sum of $16,000,000, making
for the whole year $32,733,884
Whatevei expenditures shall arise within the
year, upon new appropnations which Congress
may think proper to make, will require a corre-
sponding addition to this amount But, without
them, it will constitute an excess of $5,876,565 of
expenditures over both the receipts and the balance
at the commencement of the jear, besides not
leaving, at the close of it, any thing m the Mint
or the Treasury for future uses, or to meet contin-
gencies
In order, therefore, to discharge that excess, and
retam, of the money reserved on the 1st of Janua-
ry., one million, which is the smallest sum deemed
proper, undei the acts, of Congiess, for the efficient
operations of the Mint, and at least three oi four
millions more, to answer sudden and contingent
calls, there will probably be a necessity to resort to
the deposites now with the States, and to the instal-
ments destined for them in October, or to some
other resource, for a sum equal to $10,0(ip,000. By
a report of thelreasurer of lhe30lh ultimo, it ap-
peals that the balance m the Treasury, including
what was m the custody of banks, the Mint, and
collecting ofneefs, was then $14,5l16,311, that the
amount of this, subject to immediate draft, v¡ds
only $8,928,072, but the whole balance in the
Treasury, including all which had been deposited
with the States, and ordered to be, though only a
small part of the amount is subject to immediate
draft, was $41,532,381 Deduct all which has
been, and was designed to be, deposited with the
States, and there would be no balance left on hand
subject to draft, though including every thing in
the Mint, and in the possession of receivers and
collectors, which is applicable to general purposes
Hence it is probable, that, besides the deficiency
for the expenditures of the 5 e-ir, no sufficient means
of any land wnl exist on the fiist of October next,
after defrajing the mtervenmg evpenses, to com-
-pleie the instalment of deposiies then payable, un-
less a large part of the bonds for duties postponed
to that day, and amounting to near $4,000,000, and
the million and a half then due on the first oond
from the United States Bank, shall be punctually
paid, or, in the mean time, Some piovision on this
sobject made by Congress
The money standing to the special credit of the
Post Office Department and the Patent Office, as
well as various tiusts, is not included m the above
exhibit, for reasons explained in the last annual re-
port Outstanding and unexpended appropriations
at the end of the year will, m this view of our finan,
wal condition, be still left charged on theTieasury-
amountmg to about $16,000,000
This does not diner much from their amount at
the close of the last j ear Whethei the appropria-
tions unexpended on the first of January, 1838,
prove, therefore, to be one or two millions larger
oi smaller than 11 now anticipated, it must be mani-
fest, from all the above data, that some new legis-
lation is indispensable to complete satisfactorily the
service of the 5 ear, and leave a suitable amount in
the Mint and the Treasuiy
Indeed, befoie submitting (he last annual report,
the indications of a decrease in the receipts, and of
an approaching revulsion in our commercial pios-
perity, appeared so strong to the undesigned, that
he felt compelled, with íeluctance and regret,
because differing so much from the views of many
others, to estimate the accruing receipts for the j ear
at only $24 000,000
As  the appropriations asked   for were about
$27,000,000, it wa* then suggested that the occur-
1 rencc of a deficiency was probable    When those
appropriations became in fact enlarged by Congress
to more than $32,000,000, it rendered a deficiency
inevitable, to the extent now anticipated, unless the
receipts should happen greatly to exceed the esti-
mates.
II   ON   THE   POSTFOVEMBNT   OP     THE   PAYMENT OP
BONDS FOR nUTIES
The first suggestions which will be submitted
concerning such special legislation as appeals pro-
per in consequence of the recent embarrassments
of ihe countrj, relate to the postponement of the
payment of bonds for duties
Early m Maj last, the collection of the Tevenuo
from customs beeams much obstructed through the
severe pecuniary difficulties of the mercantile inte-
rest The Treasury Department felt an anxiety
not only to take steps which might increase the
security of the Government for eventual payment,
but, m an emergency so great, and to many so
unexpected, lo fmmsh all the relief from sacrifices
■i Inch could judiciously be extended under its
limited powers, and in anticipation of what would
piobably be its straitened condition in a few
months.
A postponement of the payment of the bond1!
falling due was, therefore, and in accordance 11th
the views of the Executive, authorized for periods
oC from thirty to ninety days, on interest and addi-
tional secuntv, and in a manner more liberal than
usual, by permitting it before as well as after suit,
m all cases of embarrassment, great hardship, or
insolvent-}
The particular terms, and the reasons for such
pos'ponement, are more fully set fotth in the docu-
ments annexed
When the difficulties in discharging bonds in a
legal currencv became increased by the suspension
of specie payments 111 some of the principal cities,
and the President deeded to call a special «ession
of Congress, the postponement was allowed to bs
extended till after the commencement of the session,
in order that an epportunity might be afforded to
obtain further relief by new legislation Urgent
requests were made for an indiscriminate delay of
payment on all bonds to the 1st of January next,
and for the rece pt, in discharge of them, of notes
issued by banks not paj nig specie
It wa-, not deemed proper to comply with these
requests. But as long a delay as oui fiscal situation
justified, and evert relief as to the currency which
seemed legal, by the receipt of debenture certificate*
and Treasury drafts, for duties, weie permitted m
mitigation oí the existing «mbarrassmenls
Having, in this, done all that a sound and liberal
exercise of the discretion oí the department ap-
peared either to justify or requ re, no intention
exists, nor would it be proper in the piesent state
of the Treasury, to grant any mdulgei ees beyond
those already authorised, without the express direc-
tion of Congress.
Some further facts which may be useful to aid
it> members in coming to a correct conclusion on
tht> subjeot, are, that the amount of bnids which
have already been postponed to the 1st cf October,
is about $3,500,000, and by that date mil, it is
piesnmed, be increased to $4,000,000.
If Congress permit no longer postponement, ihe
receipts foi the > ear u ill probably be increased by
the indulgences already gianted, as they have been
allowed, generally, on additional security, and a Í
wajs on interest.
But as suits and del-us in collection -nil still oc
cur, though to a less extent that in the first stages o
thepressme, it is expected that not over two-thirds
of the amount postponed before tbe close of tlvs
month can be cr'lected during the current year
The bonds already put in suit since the middle of
May amount to nearly $1,000,000 But if Coi -
gress extend the postponement till next January, as
was originally lequested by some of the parties, or
for one year, as recently requested bj the Ch?m-
ber of Commerce of New York, the receipts for tl <j
