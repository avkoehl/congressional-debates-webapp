Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

The Richmond Sentinel of to-day has the following:

A slight ripple of excitement was produced here yesterday by the report that a Yankee raiding party was advancing on Gordonsville and were within a few miles of that place. The result of all our inquiries on this head is that this report originated in the fact that early yesterday a party of Yankee raiders, whose number is not know, visited Rapidan bridge, and after destroying it proceed to Liberty Mills, five or six miles above, which they also destroyed. From this latter place they are supposed to have gone back to Culpeper.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

(Received 21st.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

I have the honor to report my command at Strasburg. My troops were so much fatigued by their work yesterday that I was only abe to follow the enemy a short distance south of Winchester last night. My infantry marched from Winchester to Strasburg to-day. I could not get ready to attack the enemy before night. Early was badly whipped yesterday. I have the not yet received full reports. The enemy left in Winchester over 3,000 wounded. We captured five pieces of artillery, a number of caissons, 4,000 stand of small-arms. My estimate of Early's loss yesterday is over 7,000. He lost the following general officer: Rodes and Godwin, killed; Gordon, * wounded mortally; Terry, Hays, Fitz Lee, and Bradley Johnson, wounded. General Ramseur reported by citizens as wounded; this is doubtful. My

*Error as to Gordon being mortally wounded.
