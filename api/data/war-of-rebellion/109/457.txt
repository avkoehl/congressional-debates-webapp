Lieutenant Colonel G. P. THURSTON,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Twentieth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform the general commanding that the rebels are erecting battery to the left of the battery which they put up the other day. It is on the spur of the mountain running eastward and on the first point next to Lookout Mountain. They have been showing themselves with more activity on the extreme right than they have done for some days past. This, as well as the movement of the troops to the right, may have been caused by my replacing my advanced brigace this morning by a fresh one.

I am, sir, very respectfully, yoru obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

[30.] Major-General, Commanding.
