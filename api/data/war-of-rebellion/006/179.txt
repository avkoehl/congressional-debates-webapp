WASHINGTON, October 17, 1861.

General THOMAS W. SHERMAN, Annapolis:

If General McClellan should consent to spare the New York Seventy ninth Regiment to join your expedition with General Stevens, do you want them, and have you transportation for them? Answer immediately.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

ANNAPOLIS, October 17, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

Have received your dispatch. I want the Highlanders (Seventy-ninth), and I have transportation. Send them on immediately.

T. W. SHERMAN.

WAR DEPARTMENT, October 17, 1861.

General MCCLELLAN:

If Generals Stevens and Sherman want the New York Seventy-ninth to go with expedition, can you spare them without serious loss or inconvenience? Please answer.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

CAMP GRIFFIN, October 17, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

I gave General Sherman all the regiments he asked for. At least two of those originally intended for him, and promised to me, have been diverted from me. The artillery promised me to replace Hamilton's battery have not been given to me. I will not consent to one other man being detached from this army for that expedition. I need far more than i now have to save this country, and cannot spare any disciplined regiment. Instead of diminishing this army, true policy would dictate its immediate increase to a large extent. It is the task of the Army of the Potomac to decide the question at issue. No outside expedition can effect the result. I hope that I will not again be asked to detach anybody.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
