The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication fiom the Secretary of the Treasury, i
covering certain returns relative to public lands,
which v/as laid on the table and ordered to be
printed
Also, a communication from the Secretary of the i
Navy, enclosing rules and legulations respecting
naval hospitals, which was laid on the table and
ordered to be punted     And
A message from the President, enclosing a copy
of a treaty with the Republic of Chili, which was
referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
INDIAN AFrAIRS.
The bill reported from the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, making appro-
priations for the Indian department for 1834, came
up, on concurring with the amendments made in
committee
The amendments, excepting that appropriating
$8,000 for the expense of forming a treaty with
the western Pawnees, were concuned in
That amendment having been stated,
Mr  ASHLEY said he was totally ooposed to |
the appropriation o^  money for toe purpose of,
buying peace with the Indians     There was no
necessity font   Ifthey weredisposedforhostilities, 1
Congress, at its last session, had provided ample
means for putting them down    The corps of dra-
goons had been raised to meet exigencies of this I
kind     If we should give them §8,000 for pence
this year, it would require §16,000 next year, and
the demands upon us would go on in that ratio
Mr LLWI!5 said, the object of the appropria-
tion was to enable the commissioners to redeem
the prisoners they had taken This tribe resided
at the extreme west of our territory, and he had
been informed by Governor Stokes that they pos-
sessed the fleetest horges perhaps m the world
The only way in wmch our fellow citizens could
be liberated, was to redeem them
Mi VANCE entirely concurred in the views
expressed by the gentleman from Missouri, [Mr
Ashlfy ] If prisoners taken by Indians are
redeemed, it will prove the most effectual induce-1
ment for them to capture our citizens In his ¡
view it would be one of the worst acts that could
be done                                                                          i
Mi ASHLEY said he regretted to learn fiom .
the authority of one of the commissioners of the
fleetness of these Indian horses He professed to !
have some knowledge of these matters, and had
generally found these Indian horses very inferior
animals But, whatever their horses might be, he
was opposed to the principle of the appropriation
The officer who commanded the regiment of dra-
goons was an exceedingly competent man to
anange all difficulties with these Indians, without
this appropriation
The question was then taken upon the amend
ment, and it was non concurred in, and conse-
quently struck from the bill The bill was then
ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
CH motion of Mr STEWART, the House then I
went into Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, Mr J  & Adams in the chair
Mr McKIM moved that the committee take up |
the bill for con muing and lepanmg the Cumber-
land road, and for continuing several territorial ,
and military roads for 1834
Mr STEWART suggested the propriety of I

Cumberland road                                                         |
Mr  McKIM assented to the proposition as it
embiaced a portion of the same objects    The bill
was read, and no amendment being proposed, it I
was laid aside                                                               I
Mr HUBBARD moved that the harbor bill be .
then taken up                                                               I

j tions for continuing, completing, and securing di-
vers works and improvements in different harbors
and rivers, principally on the lakes
1     The question being on the first clause of the
amendment, "For continuing and securing the
works at Oswego harbor, New York, $,30,000"—
Mi   McKAY made some objections to it, and
Mr E WHITTLESEY spoke at some length in |
its support                                      *                            I
