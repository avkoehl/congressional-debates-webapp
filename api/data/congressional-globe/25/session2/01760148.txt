CONGRESSIONAL «BWiBÉ.
guage, stated in the report of the Secrelarj of State
to this House to have b°en printed and circulated
by the late minister from the Republic of Mexico,
Gorostiza, before his departure from this countr>,
and the name of the diplomatic functionary from
a foreign Government who communicated a copy
oí said pamphlet to the Secretary of State
The question pending was the motion of Mr
HOWARD to strike ont all thatpart relating to the
name of the diplomatic functionary, after the word
"country" in the eighth line
Mr HOWARD, remaiking that the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr Cushing) entitled to the
flooi being absent from indisposition, moved to
postpone the further consideration of the subject till
to-morrow
Mr ADAMS deemed it of great importance that
the pamphlet in question should be in the posses-
sion of the House, from the attitude of our relations
with Mexico, and, consequently, that the resolution
should be soon adopted, because it would take
some time to translate the pamphlet He, there-
fore, expressed a hope that the gentleman fiom
Maryland would withdraw his objection, or that
the House would take the question at once
In reference to the merits of the call, Mr A in
sisted that the information was indispensable to the
House Here was the country brought to the very
verge of a war by the course of the Executn e, and
yet they were den ed the information upon whi<-h
the Presidenthad brought the country to this point
Mr A said "denied," for, m the call of the House
for the correspondence between this Government
and that of Mexico, all communication between
the ministers of the two countries had been express-
ly and positively withheld or suppressed, under the
restrictive clause in the call so strenuously insisted
upon by th" gentleman from Georgia, (Mr Haynes)
viz that saying it, in his (the President's) opinion,
not incompatible with the public interest Now, if
there were negotiations pending at this time be-
tween Mexico and the United States, that would
be a sufficient reason for the President to deny
communicating these papers, but when they were
told that no negotiations were pending, f ir Ihey
were informed that the President had exhausted all
argument for negotiating, and nothing more was
to be done but for Congress to assume their
power, it did seem the most extraordinary thing in
the world that all the information m possession of
the Executive, could not be at once communicated
"What1 were they to go to war without this infor-
mation'2 Was this conntry to be drawn into a
declaration of war, without being put in posses
sion of the information necessary to show the
grounds of such a step1? Surely they ought to have
a copy of that pamphlet, a pamphlet described,
m a demi-semi official response to it as an out-
rage without precedent Mr A did not justify
the act of Gorostiza, which might be called an act
of indiscretion, but it did not merit all that had
been said of it Nor was it without precedent, and
he particularly referred to the case of Gwmnett
Mr A's remarks were cut off by the annuncia-
tion ®f the spacial order,  being the case of the
MISSISSIPPI ELECTION.
The question pending being as follow
Mr BRONSON moted the following resolution
Resolved, That Messrs S S Prentiss and T J
Word are not members of the 25th Congress, and
are not entitled to their seats in the House as such
The question pending bei ig on the motion of
Mr Bell, «ho had moved to amend by striking
out all aftei the word "Resolved," and inserting as
follows "That the resolution of this House of the
3d October last, declaring that Samufl J Gholson
and John F H Cl«borne were duly elected mem-
bers of the 25th Congress, vs as agreed to without a
knowledge of all the fac s which were material to
a correct decision of the question presented, and
the same is heieby rescinded "
Resolved fa titer, ThatMeisrs Prentiss and Word
were duly elected members of the 25ih Congress
from the State of Mississippi, m November last,
and aie entitled to take their seats as such
Mr LEGARE, who was entitled to the floor, ad-
dressed the House at considerable length m support
of the right of the sitting member*, Messrs Clai-
borne and Ghoisi , to letain their seats    Mr. L
uent into a lengthy argument to prove that the sit-
ting membeis v\pie duly elected by the people of
Mi'-si^sidpi, and that they .were entitled to sea s for
the whole Congress He based his argument on
me Constitution of the United States, it being over
and above the acts of the Governor and people of
Mississippi, and the argument of gentlemen tha 
it was only intended to elect the sitting members
for the extra session by the people, he considered
entirely erroneous
Mi EVANS addressed the House at some
length in support of the rights of the contestants to
seats, and in repl to tne arguments of the gent e-
man iiom feouth Carolina, (Mr Legare,) aid
others, who had spoken m favor of the sitting mem-
bers
Mr CUSHMAN then stated that as this ques-
tion had consumed a great deal of the time of the
House, and as he presumed every gentleman had
now made up his opinion m relation to the ques-
tion, he now demanded the previous question
Mr WISC called the attention of the gentleman
from New Hampshire to the facts that one of the
membeis now asking seats on this floor had not had
the opportunity of sajmg a word, and that it w"s
the wish of the other gentlemen again to address
some remarks to the House, in reply to the argu
ments which gentlemen had made lft opposition to
their light to seats m this Congress
Mr CUSHMAN replied that if this was the
case, he would withdraw the motion, to enable the
contes ints to address the House, if they desired it
Mr PRENTISS then rose, and it timated a
mí h to ac'dress some remarks to the House, but
gai e wai to
Mr MASON of Virginia, who addressed the
House for a few minutes m explanation of the v >te
he had given at the extra session. He stated tnat
at the extra session n<> had voted in favor of the sit
ting members taking their seats m this House, b it
iiom subsequent examination and reflection, he
had come to the deteimmation that the bettei pi in
w ould be to send both the delegations back to i e
people
Mr PRENTISS then obtained the floor, and
addressed t íe House a few minutes, when he gave
way to
Mr WISE, on whose motion,
The House adjourned
