infantry from General McCook's corps, to follow the route lately taken by General Crook, till it reaches the Chattanooga road, where it will reconnoiter that road to the southern spur of Missionary Ridge to ascertain whether the enemy is retreating in that direction. Send another brigade, also to be supported by a brigade of infantry, to enter the Broomtown Valley and push from Alpine as far toward Summerville as may be safe and necessary. The enemy is believed to be in full retreat, and it is most important to now where he is going and by what routes. You have not a moment to lose in starting these expeditions.

Hold your whole command in readiness for and advance. The reconnaissance must be made thoroughly and with vigor.

Very respectfully,your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
