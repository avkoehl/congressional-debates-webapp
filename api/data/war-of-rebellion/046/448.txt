HEADQUARTERS MORRIS ISLAND, August 30, 1863.,CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations during last night and to-day:

As usual, the enemy were quiet during the night, and were busily engaged in trying to complete their works, in which they were greatly disturbed by the fire from Fort Wagner, assisted by the batteries on James Island. They attempted to advance a sap on the left of the fort, but were soon compelled to leave the work. During the morning, there was little firing on the part of the enemy exception from their sharpshooters, who are very vigilant. This evening they opened a brisk fire their mortars on Fort Wagner and upon Fort Gregg, with their Parrott guns. No serious damage was done to the work, but there were a good many men wounded by their shells.

The firing from the James Island batteries, was sometimes effective; at other times the shell went over or fell short of the enemy's works. The fire from Fort Moultrie was well directed.

Below you will find a report of the shots fired from Fort Wagner.

The disposition of the troops is as follows;

Thirty-second Georgia and Eighth North Carolina, around the works at Wagner; Twentieth South Carolina and Twenty-third Georgia in reserve and along the sand-hills in readiness to be relieved.

Early this morning, the enemy kept up a brisk fire for about an hour upon Fort Sumter with their heavy guns.

Respectfully submitted.

A. H. COLQUITT,

Brigadier-General.

Captain W. F. NANCE, Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - Four or 5 men slightly wounded at Fort Gregg this evening, whose names we have not learned; they belonged to the Thirty-second Georgia.
