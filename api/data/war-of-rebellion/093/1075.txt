COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that as soon as the boats carrying troops of your command have coaled, that they will be sent forward to the mouth of the Cumberland River and await at that point further orders from you. If, on arriving at that point, you find that the other divisions are not there, move your command up the river to Nashville in fleet, if all your boats are there, but do not wait for one or two boats. It is important that you arrive at Nashville as soon as possible.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
