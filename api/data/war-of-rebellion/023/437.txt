order quartermaster at Cincinnati to send canteens, haversacks, and tents to Colonel Swords?

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, August 27, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

No reply received to General Wright's application for change of order about delivering arms to recruits before being mustered into service. Every regiment raised last fall and three cavalry regiments just raised in Kentucky received arms and equipments long before they could be mustered in. We have men in camp in exposed positions without arms. They will not remain without arms. I fear the order will lead to disorganization and do us great harm. We are not in same situation as in States north of us. We are surrounded by bands of guerrillas and by the Regular Army. I hope I can be allowed to furnish arms and other equipments on requisition of the military authorities of the State. This is important to us, to prevent recruiting for rebels and to subjugate the scoundrels in our midst.

Brigadier-General.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

You must confer with General Rousseau in Nashville. Have officers arrested who neglect or abandon their duties and prefer charges. I can't at this distance and this time attend to it. Send out citizen scouts to find trains and the divisions from Florence.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

Negroes must be impressed to cut and haul timber and help in rebuilding bridges and getting trains through. Use plenty of them.

JACINTO, August 28, [1862]-4.30 p.m.

General ROSECRANS:

John Manuel, a reliable Union man, left my lines this morning to go to his home, 13 miles south. He has sent me the following:

The telegraph to Tupelo says Buell badly whipped. Morgan in Buell's rear. General Price has his headquarters at Saltillo, and was aiming to move on Jacinto with a large force. Price had sent 6,000 cavalry west, with six day's rations, to attack the lines.

I have sent for Manuel.

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General.
