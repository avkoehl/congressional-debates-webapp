Tieaswy Note BUI—Sir, Evans.
H. of Reps*
nary operations of Government, whit ground ¡o
there for &uppoí.o¿ that the same services cíii be
performed this year for imeeen milhchs anda
quarter? I am rot now looking at all at the ap
propnations made or proposed for the last or ihe
present year, but at the amount actually expended.
I am aware ih° apprepi-iatimis which faa^e been
requested are made 10 correspond t) tho e es'imates
of expenditure. But I wish to know what lavish
expendieres were nade in 1840, is Inch may be
dispensed with m 184 P What extravagance is to
be reformed? We ad know that, owing to the em-
barrassed state of tne Treasury last year, both the
appropriations and ihe expenditures were kept
down to the lowest po*sib e amount. Wheie can
there be any greater reduction for the present yeai?
The Secretary answers in these word1-:
"It is believed that the ordinary expenses of 1841 ought to
fall some millions below those of |840, as the pensions ha\s
diminished by deaths, fewer Indians remain to oe íemoved
several expensive public buildings jiave been mostly finish
ed, and hobtilittes with theSem notes ransc be nearer to a close '
These are the heads oí expenditure in wjicn the
reduction of over tlree millions and a quar.er is
proposed to be mad"; and I will examine them in
the order they are named
l«t. As to tne pensions The Secre'aiy has re-
ferred several times m his reports, lo ¡be great relief
which the Treasury is to experience from the deaths
of the old soldier  of the Revolution, and iheir aged
and impoverished widows. He seem* almost im-
patient, because they are so lrn^ a charge upon the
country. But let that pass. How much doe he
expect to save from this source' By th  report of
the Commissioner of Pur-ioi • , a d of the S cretary
of War also, it appear, that ",he total amount
drawn from the Treasury durmg 'he past year, to
pay pensions, is $3,048,663," m round numbers,
two millions. It appears, further, from the state-
ment of the Commosionei, that the pensioners, ex-
clusive of naval, are divided into six classes, vi¿
invalid, under aet of 1818, under act of 1828, un-
der act of 1833, under act of 1836, under act of
1838. TJader the first class there are 4 289 pen-
sioners, and the deaths last year were 48—not quite
one per cent Under the second class there are
7,947 pensioners, and the deaths last year v ere
256—a little over Ihiee per cent. Under the third
class there are 605, and the deaths were 17—about
three per cent Under the fourth class the number
is 23 207, and the deaths were 974—something over
four per cent. Under the fith class thete are 2,760,
and the deaths were 139—which is five percent.
Under the sixth class the'humber is 5,586, and the
deaths were 171—a little over three per cent
Nonr, sir, mak ng some allowance for oenhs, the
Knowledge of which had not come to thi Depig-
ment, as the Commissioner suggests is Ihe case,
and something for the advancing age of the re-
maining pensioners, from which it is probable that
the per centage of deaihs will increase from }ear
to year, 1 suppose th&t ihenu-aber of deadi-, m 1841
will be ten per cent, of the whole number in all the
classes; and this is a larger propor.ion, I tmnir,
than has ever taken place in any tvo jears to-
gether since the pens-on laws have been in opeia-
tion: the saving up^n tb?u basis will be jusi $200,-
480, and no more.    But, on the olher hand,  the
Commissioner supposes that there  will be 1,400
added to  the sixth cla^s during ih  present j ear,
whose applications hate already been made, and
are under examvnpiion, pnd, if so, they will  be
entitled to the whole five yeats,' pension, ratable at
once, which will undoubtedly require from thres to
four hundred thousand dollars.
The appropriation bill already repor'ed
for the payment of pensioners, ex-
clusive of the fourth cLs<,  which  is
provided  for by  the   act  of  1832,
amounts, agreeably to the estimates,
to    .           .           .           .              $1,042,555
The standing appropr.atton under the
aet of 1832, as estimated by the Se-
cretary for this yev, is .           . 630,000
The unexpended balance of former apj
propnations, now on hand,appiicab e
to the service of this year, is.            .     561,000

for K41      .... p,203,5P5
?te esoeeds  she amount   actually
drawn from the Tiea<,ury for last year,   $154 892
Ths «mount thus cstimat-*, snd to be appto-
pria'ed for ihe y ar, is ether wanted or it i  not.
¿f it is wante), it exceeds tne artount drawn from
the Treasury in 1840, as berore stated, and th*ie
will be no relucts ii, bB'rttherai ir cease ft ooi

braced m \h" estimate^, and why a'e billsrepTt'd
to appropratf ill It is net u d rctord, I pre-
sume, ih u the whole pmouiit paid fcr pensions last
jear wes but 02 048,663 This was tho sum
"d'awn ñuta the Treasury ' and formed part of
the current expense, of 1840. The amount ac't.-
allv paid was probibly •¡om^what 1 rger, perhaps
200 003 to 300,000 dolar,. The balance was
made up of money drawn m 1839, and fcrnnnga
part of the expenditures oi thit >ear, but reman -
aig in the hands ot the various pension agents un-
expended. S mcthwg undoubtedly remains in
their hards now, which is to bo added to the 'urns
before s'a'ed, a" applicable to tbr service of 18 ll
but wh ch will forrn no chiisre upjn tho Treasury
of this jear, as >f is airead} withdrawn from it.
Toe second i a m "si¡>red by 'ho Secretar/, for
tie eypi-ct d reduction in 1841, is, that '""eiver In-
dians remain to b  removed" Nov what wete
tue exdend'iuresfrr remnva's lest yea,' The Com-
rn'Sbionei of Indi?n Affairs reports That, dnnng
the preced.nz year 5,671 were remove1; 4,500 of
them b< ing r f th° WinneD?.gocs, for which ai ap
propnatcn rf ¿,45 000 was made last year, and
whuhwas probib'y sufficient If the remaining
1 171 were removed at the sam  " te,'he wiole co-t
tf ¡emovais last ye* was but &56 710 I  also ap-
peal  bv th-same íept rt,'luí 21 774 sun ¡emai
tobe removed, and abbotg' th roare ''fewer"than
there were a year ago, ye the e s fall em u->h re-
maining to allow a-, many n be reme ed in 1841 as
were lerroved i" ¡bid Ho , il cs j'an ear that
such will not be the ca^e? But giant that the whole
amount will be saved, and it will add but $56 7..0
to the reduction estimated on pensions.
The next reason is,' several expensive public
buildings have been mosily finished.'

Assuming th s staiemeat 1 ¡ be eoireet, which it

ne" c arge upt n ti e >ear 1841, f«r wb ch no cor-
respouliog expsnditu e was made m 1840 I mean
the pay/nen's for the cen^us—a ^ert ce reaiered ia
1840, and frr which app'opnadcis were made that
year, but have not been enenced—nit drawn
from 'he Treas iry. The chorge ihus imposed
upon 1841 will be «bout $720 000, of which $550,-
000 are wanted lor the fir-i quarter, the balance
will f>ll upon ths residue of the 3ear. This angle
item, rew in lis c*-ar?eler andehargeab'e solely
upon this year, very nearly meets all tha íedac-
twnii which can be made from the sources indi-
cated by the Secretary.
Bun bio is n"tal!. There, are other and heavier
expenses to fall upon the Tie sury in 1841, of
which the Secretary takes no no ice, although it is
scarce.y possible he wa not advised of them. The
honorable chairman of (he W?ys and Means is
equally silent upon the «ubjeC, though wen known
to him aiso. So far f¡ m incr being any reduc-
tion this 5 ear, becaus; ' hos íhtie? wi h the Semi-
nóles must be rearer to a close," there is now a
proposition before the CoJimit'ee of Ways and
Means for an appropnauon oí near two millions
and a half of doli?rs, sabm.ued by the Secretiry of
War on the 17th December last, ten days only after
the e^timaies for the jear were piepared. Ihe ne-
cessity for this is ieprtsent>dasiery urgent. About
half a nvl ¡on of it is wan ed to pay for arrear-
ages of 1840, for services already rendered, and
which ought to have been a cnarge on that year,
ane not on 1841. Why was it not ernbiaced w.thin
the estímales for th s yea.* Wis in not known to
the Secretary on tre 7in Decemoer, the date of hi*
annual repor 1 Wa--11 kepi back by tne Secretary
if Wi , il ■ li/ i 1 His rtpoit is daied Decem-
ber 5 Now, sir, on the 13 h November preceding,
the Paymaster Gencitd, in obedien-e to the direc-
tions of the Secretary of War, submit ed to him an
estimate, amounting to $250,690, for the payment
of militia musteied into bervice m 1840. On the
17th December, the Secretary of War speaks of it
in these words:
Thii pay is now due and, as the hoops stai d much m need
of injustice to them requites that it should be paid to them at
tbeeaihestpo  'bleday"
Azara, General Jesup, on the 14th November,
submitted to the Secretary of War, by hi-direc-
tion', "t.n est roste of the a!ro'int wl ich will pro-
baoiy be required for the service of this depart-
ment m pro-ecutmg the wnr m Florida" This
estimate, including two hundred thousand dollars
lor arrevs of 1810, expenses ihetdy ineu*red, but
not paid, amoun s to t, 1,300,000, cl which he te-
que-ted that $400,000 m ght be appropna'ed "as
ear'y m the sess on as pos tole," being wanted for
immediate use. On t_e 23th November, General
Je«up, id another report to the Secretary of War,
says that the failure of the Aikin^as delegat on to
effect a satisfactory arrangement with the Semi-
mles induces "the Dehef that a jreatei amount will
probably be required than thit for which I pte-
sent^d an esiimate in ih  14th instant." Agam, !
inquire, why were not these sums, thus approved
by tne Secretary of War, and mide known to him
by the midd e of November, and urgently requested
on the 17th December—wb> were_th v noterabraceá
withtn the e-,timates «ubmi fd on 7th December?
