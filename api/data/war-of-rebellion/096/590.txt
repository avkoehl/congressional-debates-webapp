NORFOLK, VA., February 18, 1865.

Major HICKS,

Commanding Fort Magruder:

MAJOR: Application has been made to headquarters for the two companies of cavalry. Telegraph if the enemy appears in force before you. Do you wish the furloughs you have forwarded granted under present circumstances? Major Darling will reach Fort Magruder in a few days, being delayed.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 18, 1865.

Major HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All is quiet in this vicinity at present. I will promptly notify you if the enemy appears. I think that it will do no harm to grant the furloughs now in hand; I have stopped them here. If I had the cavalry I would send out scouting parties. I have no doubt of quite a force of rebel cavalry above, as they are seen on York River, Jamestown Island, and by our picket-line; also, by reports of deserters and refugees, which tend to confirm the reports. I have a strong picket-line, also a reserve. I think that I am all right. My cavalry force is so small that they are overworked. Thirty-three are on duty every day, and as I have only 115 total you can see the amount of work to be done.

Very respectfully,

J. C. HICKS,

Major Sixteenth New York Artillery, Commanding Post.

NORFOLK, VA., February 18, 1865.

FORT MAGRUDER, February 18, 1865.

Major W. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Telegram received. The force on Jamestown Island is thirty-five men of the Sixteenth New York Artillery, under the command of Carlo Blomberg, lieutenant Company D, Sixteenth New York Artillery. They are picked men.

Very respectfully,

J. C. HICKS,

Major, Commanding.
