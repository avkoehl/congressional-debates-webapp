WILMINGTON, December 31, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond, Va.:

In the emergency now upon us we have three resources: Emancipation and the negro, a faithful and efficient execution of the conscript law, and the large en employed army in the Trans-Mississippi. The first would be fatal, the next has been to long and fatally postponed, the last is available, only requiring tact, energy, and will. If the East is lost, the West must follow; if the East is save, the West can be redeemed. Use this for our cause.
