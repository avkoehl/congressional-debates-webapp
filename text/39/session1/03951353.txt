1866.
THE -CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1:
ted States proposing to recognize them as mem-
bers of the Federal Union upon certain terms
and conditions. Then, sir, where is the Union
into which you propose to admit Colorado? Is
it into the Union formed by your fathers? No,
sir ; but you propose to admit her into a Union
ffitli some of the States, but not into a Union
composed of all the States. I prefer that when
Colorado shall bo admitted into the Union, she
shall be admitted into the Union as we have
heretofore understood and known it to lie, as
our fathers intended it should be, and not into
a partial Union with a certain limited number
of States. I shall not detain the Senate by any
argument on this subject. I shall content my-
self with voting against the bill.
Mr. GRIMES. Mr. President, there is prob-
ably no State in the Union more deeply inter-
ested in having a strong and prosperous State
in the Territory now known as the Territory
of Colorado (ban the State of which I am in
part the representative. She is destined to be,
when she becomes a State, one, o£ our neigh-
bors. We are intimately connected with her,
and always will be. I presume that a larger
portion of the population of Colorado emigrated
from the State of Iowa than from any other
State; and I appfehend wo are now more inti-
mately connected with her and the people of
Iowa are more thoroughly acquainted with the
history and condition of Colorado than the peo-
ple of any other State. Hence, nothing would
afford me greater pleasure, if I thought I eould
do so in justice to the other States and in jus-
tice to myself, than to vote for her admission
into the Union. But, entertaining the opin-
ions I do, believing that such a vote is calcu-
lated to lead to most. disastrous consequences
in the future, I am constrained, notwithstand-
ing the interest which my constituents I am
aware feel in the admission of Colorado, to
vote in opposition to this bill.
I do not predicate my opposition to it upon
the two reasons assigned by the Senator from
Massachusetts. The simple objection that I'
have to the admission of Colorado as a State is
the fact that she has not population enough, ;
and that nothing in my conviction could possi- '
blybe more injurious to the people of Colorado
themselves than to permit her to erect herself ;
into a State with a population of only from i
15,000 to 25,000. I have had about as much :
experience in territorial life as almost any one |
else. It has so happened to me that I have
lived in three different Territories under three
different territorial governments, although I
have resided in the same town all the time.
The State of Iowa was admitted into the
Union when she had a population of one hun-
dred and thirty thousand. She came in upon
the old theory, which it was supposed wo were
always going to adhere to, that no State should
be admitted into tlie Union until she had the
population required to send a Representative
(o Congress under the then existing represent-
ative ratio. She had some forty thousand more,
if I recollect aright, when she was admitted
than was required, for I think the ratio then
was about ninety-two thousand five hundred.
With a population of one hundred and thirty
or one hundred and forty thousand, and after
wo had been in a territorial condition for twelve
or fourteen years, with a vast amount of real
estate owned by the State (for the land offices
were opened there in 1838) and by non-resi-
dents, which was subject to taxation for the pur-
pose of supporting the government, yet the very
first thing that the people of the State of Iowa
■were compelled to do was to go into the money
market of New York and borrow money at the
enormous rate of ten per cent, in those days,
for the purpose of defraying the necessary
expenses of the government; and for ten or
twelve years we were compelled to pay that
interest and at the same lime be constantly
. in debt, because we had not property sufficient
to support the government,; und why? -Let me
tell gentlemen who have not lived in anew Statue
that they cannot conceive of the constant drain
that is made upon everybody who emigrates to
one of those States. Everything is new.- Dwell-
ings have to be built, farms have to be flowed
and improved, school-houses have to be erected,
churches must be built, roads must be con-
structed, and charitable institutions must be
established. All these things have to be done,
as well as the ordinary State, county, and town-
ship taxes paid; and the result is that the
people in a new State like Colorado, with the
population that there is in that State, and with
comparatively no real estate to tax, nothing but
; personal property, will be oppressed with tax-
' ation. If I were a citizen of Colorado i would
I remonstrate and protest against the admission
i of the State under all circumstances until there
j were at least one hundred thousand people
! there to support the State government. I ean-
1 not conceive of anything that can be more
i oppressive, th'at can possibly be more injurious
■ to the people of that Territory than to allow
her, with her small population, to come into
the Union and be compelled to pay her own
| expenses from this time forward.
: Now, what is her population'! I hold in my
hand a certified statement from an executive
; officer of the Territory of Colorado, showing
; what was the population in 1861, and the vote
cast in the differentyears, 1861,1862,1864, and
1 1865, from which we must deduce our conclu-
1 sions as to what the present population is. In
order that we may see what we are doing, and
i that we may have some criterion by which to
be governed, when Nebraska, that has already
, formed her constitution with a population of
| twenty-six thousand, and when Montana and
Idaho I hat arc already attempting to form Slate
constitutions, present themselves, I present this
table to the Senate. It may be useful in the
future to those who come after us:
