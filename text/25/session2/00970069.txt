tioa of a large majority m this Hou e and in the
Seoate, and ilia enough for our purpose that the
treaty toas wade the law of the land, and carried
jato effect. Mr. G then proceeded at some length
to trace the piobable evil results ot the prebent dis-
cussion, and the bad feeling it would cant* among
the Cherokee* It would, in a mannei, countenance
iheir resistance to the fulfilment of the treaty, and
hence it was possible that depredations might
arise, and the same scenes. agam attempted, wh ch

Mr. GRAHAM moved to funher modify the le-
sotution, by striking out "State of Georgia," and
inserting "the said tribe of Indians east of the Mis-
s ssippt river "
Mr. DAWSON" felt glad ihit the resolution had
given ns>? to the present discussion, as it had
thrown open the subject m such a way as to give
him and his colleagues an opportunity of stating
the true condition ot thing  He, for one, was
proud lo avow to the world that the Cherokee In-
dians were the most moral of any tube in the Uni-
ted States But to what cause was it to be attri-
buted. He would tell them. Tneir high state of
civilization had grow n out of the humane policy
pursued toward them by their neighbors. It waa
the people of Georgia who had accomplished it, by
establishing missionaries anions them, and adopt-
ing other salutaiy measures The Legislature of
Georgia had thrown her protection around them,
and placed them upon the same footing as the
white man, and injuries could no more? be inflicted
upon an Indian with impunity, than thay could up-
on their own cmzens But his object in offering
the resolution, was that ihe true state of affairs
might be made knovvn to the country. Georgia
desired not to mteifere with any arrangements o(
the General Government, but in justice to heiself
required information, as to the course the Govern-
ment intended to pursue
Mr. EVERETT made some remaihs, in which
he endeavored to show that no treaty had ever
been made by the Cherokees, and that the agents
who cla'med to have represented them had not
been authorized so to do , consequently, it would
be extremely unjust to attempt to force them from
their country, m pursuance of a pretended treaty,
when, in fact, none such had evei been made or
agreed to by them With that view, he moved an
amendment to the resolution, as follows " and
that the President be requested to lay before this
House copies of all documents relating to the init-
iation of the late treaty with the Cheiokee Indians,
and ot all communications of the Chuokee Indians
relating thereto "
Mr. IIOLSEY replied at length lie urged that,
the treaty having been made and confirmed by
Congress, the Executive had a light to make use
of the standing force ot the nation to tompel its
fulfilment.
Mr. WISE was in favor of the amendment
oifered by the gentleman tiom Vermont, (Mr
Everett,) for he was certain that, when all the do-
cuments came to Tie examined, there was no man
who would say that the treaty had eier been uni-
fied by the Cherokees
Mr DAWSON made an ineffectual atttmpt to
induce Mr Everett to withdiaw his amendment
Alter some Anther rtmarks from Messrs EVE-
RETT and GLASCOCKt
Mr IÍAYNES said it was obvious that there
wasiio connection between the original resolution,
as offered by his colleague, (Mr Dawson,) and the
amendment proposed by the honorable gentleman
from Vermont, (Mr Everett) The purpose of
th« resolution was to obtain information Irom the
War Department touching the progiess made m
the execution of the Cherokee treaty, and the mea-
sures which might heieüfter beome necessary to
enforce its fulfilment VV e desired to obtain that
information for the purpose of quieting the mmds
of our constituents living m the Cherokee countr)
that wasall Piom the amendment itseli, proposed
by the honorable gentleman from Vermont, it was
manifest that his object was to bring up the ques-
tion of ueaty or no treaty But that honorable
gentleman had distinct!} avowed it to le h¡s object
to raise that question It «as, he believed, thu
first time he had ever heard  it avowed that this
House was the treat v -making power Mr H
would not request the honorable member from
Vermont to withdraw his proposed amendment, as
he did not suppose he could be more successful in
appealing to his courtesy than other* had been, to
whom it had been denied Hewoull not gro into
the numerous topics which had been drawn into
this discussion Of the arguments ot the honoia-
ble gentleman from Vermont, (Mr Everett,) and
the honorable gentleman trom Virginia, (Mr Wi e,)
he would say, that their sum and substance was
thr- that a treaty was very good if they liked it,
and very bad if they did not like it
Mr DAWSON again expressed a hope that the
amendment of Mr Everett would be withdrawn
Mr OWENS moved to liy it on the table, but
the question bein  taken on his motion, it «a' lost
After some further debate b"twe°n Messrs
WISE, GRANTLAND, TOWNS and EVER
ETT, the question was taken on Mi Everett's
amendment, an! rejected without a division
The resolution, as modified by Mr Wise, was
then agreed to
Mr EVERETT submitted the following "And
that the President be requested to lay before this
House copies of all documents relating to the le-
gnlation of the lat  treaty with the Cherokee In-
dians, and of all communications of the Cherokee
Indians relative thereto "
Some further remarks were then made by Messrs.
EVERETT, WISE, GRANTLAND, TOWNS,
and GLASCOCK, when
Mr OWENS moved to lay the whole subject on
the table   1 ist
Mr. HAYNES then spoke for some time against
the proposed amendment of Mr EVERCTT, when
the question was taken, and it was rejected, vv uhout
a division
