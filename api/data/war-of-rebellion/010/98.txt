Honorable E. M. STANTON.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Pittsburg, Tenn., April 13, 1862.

SIR: It is the unanimous opinion here that Brig. General W. T. Sherman saved the fortune of the day on the 6th instant, and contributed largely to the glorious victory on the 7th. He was in the thickest of the fight on both days, having three horses killed under him and being wounded twice. I respectfully request that he be made a major-general of volunteers, to date from the 6th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, April 23, 1862.

The President desires to know why you have made no official report to this Department respecting the late battle at Pittsburg Landing,
