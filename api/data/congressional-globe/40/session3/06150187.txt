APPENDIX TO'THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
40th Cong....Sd Sess.
Reduction of the Army—Mr. Butler.
Ho. oj? Reps.
Therefore I say that the argument fails and
conies to naught which says that we cannot
reduce this force because these men have been
bred to the profession of arms and have been
brought up to it from boyhood.
How do I propose to reduce it? I have pro-
posed to reduce the whole force in this way:
there shall be aboard of fifteen officers selected
by the President in the way proposed in this
bill. There shall be three generals, one from
civil life ; three infantry officers, one from civil
life, and one commanding colored troops, and
so on. There shall be a board of officers,
which, when you reckon it up, of eight West
Point officers and seven volunteer officers, de-
tailed by the President for good conduct, sol-
dierly qualities, and professional ability. Those
men are to select the list of men out of which
selections shall be made of those to be retained
in the Army. The board selects who of all
the men in the Army are worthy to be retained
at all, and from that list the President shall
select as many as are necessary to officer twenty-
five thousand men with the proper staffs. There
is one class of exception, and that is the men
who arc holding office in the Army and who
occupied "softplaees" during the war at their
own request, or who refused to go into the field
because they would not fight against their
States and were put on mustering and commis-
sary duty in the North, the men who took
good care to keep in " soft places " all during
the war at their own request. I have provided
when that appears they shall be left out, and
meritorious officers shall he selected in pref-
erence.
The next proposition in which I differ from
the committee is in regard to the pay of the
Army. I have fixed the pay of each grade of
officers in this form, subject of course to the
betterjudgmentoftheHouse: Lieutenant Gen-
eral to have 312:'W0 a year. $4,000 more than
the Speaker of this House and $4,000 more
than the Vice President 5 major general, $7,500;
brigadier general, $5,000; colonel, $3,500;
lieutenant colonel, $2,750; major, $2,500; cap-
tain, mounted, $2,000; captain, not monnted,
$1,800; adjutant, $1,800; regimental quarter-
master, $1,800; first lieutenant, mounted,
$1,600; first lieutenant, not mounted, $1,500;
second lieutenant, mounted, $1,500; second
lieutenant, not mounted, $1,400; chaplain,
$3,200; aid-de-camp to major general, $200 in
addition to pay of his rank; aid-de-camp to
brigadier general, $150 in addition to pay of
his rank; acting assistant commissary, $100 in
addition to pay of his rank; and that these
sums shall be in full of everything.
Then I provide that commutation for fuel,
quarters, forage, rations, longevity rations,
servants' clothing, pay, and rations, and every-
thing of that sort in the way of allowances shall
be done, ended, cease, be got rid of, cut off,
and put a stop to. [Laughter.] I provide that
that great abuse shall be finally brought to an
end, if it is possible to be done by legislative
act.
I have provided, however, when officers travel
they shall have ten cents per mile, and that
according to post routes. And there is a
special provision that the paymaster shall alone
pay the officers all they shall receive. Now
he only pays the pay proper and rations and
servants' allowances, while the quartermaster
general's department pays commutation for
quarters and fuel and forage. In some cases
the commissary department pays him for his
rations. As it is now it is next to impossible
to tell how much an officer gets. I want to put
a stop to all that.
If the pay and allowances provided in this
bill can become law, and the supernumerary
officers cut off, then we can make the saving
shown in the following table :
Pay of officers and clerks of the Army as reduced, and the Army made by this Mil.
Department.
Salaries of officers and
clerks of the different
branches of the War
Department and of of-
ficers of the Army, in-
cluding commutation
of all sorts and all al-
lowances, and the ex-
pense of printing for
the Army for the years
1867-6S.
Estimate of the sal-
aries of officers and
clerks if the number
and pay of officers is
reduced in accord-
ance with the bill
and the clerical
force is continued
as at present.
Estimate of salaries
if the number and
pay of officers is re-
duced in accord-
ance with the bill

or about 48 per cent
! will refer now to a matter merely to show f
how these allowances and privileges grow into 1
abuses. In addition to what I have already J
stated, these officers also have the right to buy j
everything from the commissary department !
which they use as food, whether of necessity or ^
luxury. When officers are in the field this priv- .

ilege was allowed them to get what they wanted
to eat from the commissary department at the
contract price, because they could not buy their
rations elsewhere than from the Government;
but that practice has grown until it has got to
this pass. It is carried into the cities and towns,
and wherever there are commissarv stores, and
they buy their food now at the wholesale price
of the Government. When that privilege was
proposed to be interfered with in the appro-
priation bill it was of so much consequence
that the chairman of the Committee on Military
Affairs raised a point of order upon it to strike
out the provision. He wanted to save the right
of buying rations to the officers. Now, what
does it mean?
Mr. GARFIELD. The letter I had read
from the Commissary General explained pre-
cisely that; as we had abolished the office of
sutler and allowed officers of the Army in the
commissary department to furnish sutlers' sup-
plies, the gentleman's bill would cut off the
allowance of any such supplies.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I am
going to that. I understand it all thoroughly.
The commissary department buys an ox at
eight cents per pound, and it is slaughtered
and cut up and the best pieces are sold to the
officers at eight cents per pound, and these
pieces go to their landlords, while the shin-
bones and poor cuts go into the hospitals and
quarters of the men, for which the United
States pays the same price as the officers do
for the best ones. That is what the tenderness
about this privilege means, and the practice
prevails everywhere.
It gives to the officers canned meats, pre-
served fruits, coffee, sugar, tea, and everything
of that sort, bought at wholesale by the com-
missary and sold to the officers at the same
price. Now, I agree that the abolition of this
, practice will not be a great saving to the Gov-
■ eminent, and perhaps I ought not to have
! spoken of it, but I do speak in behalf of the
men. When you hear them grumbling about
their rations it is not because the commissary
has failed to buy good rations, but because they
only get the inferior part of the rations which
the United States pay for at the same price as
for the best. Therefore we fonnd the moment
wc struck at that little abuse a letter came to
the chairman of the committee, saying " Look
out for our rations." [Laughter.] "Takecare
that the privilege of buying them is not cut off.
Take care of our preserved fruits, that we may
not have to pay for them only the wholesale
price."
Mr. ROSS. Does the gentleman know that
officers on the plains draw coffee by the sack
and sell it ?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I do not
know that fact. I am speaking of what can
be done under the law. On the plains I sus-
pect they are all pretty lawless. I am talking
about what is done in Washington right under
our noses, and there are men who know the
fact that Army officers have paid their board
bills to their landladies in whole or in part by
selling the meat which they have thus obtained
at the wholesale price. And there are mem-
bers here who will confirm what I have said.
Therefore I have endeavored in this bill to cut
off all allowances which may grow into abuses,
and substitute a salary only.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Will the gentleman in-
form the House to whom he refers?
Mr. BUTLER, ofMassachusetts. The officer
or the member of the House?
Mr. ELDRIDGE. To what gentleman in
the House does he refer?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. He sits
right before me. He stated this fact in the
House the other day.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Is he white or black?
[Laughter.]
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I have
never seen a black officer do anything but his
duty.
Now, sir, I have been speaking of the abuses
that may be cut off only. I have but one or
two other provisions to which I will call the
attention of the committee. I have provided
that hereafter the line of the Army shall consist
of twenty-four regiments of infantry. I have
also provided that three of them shall be th*
