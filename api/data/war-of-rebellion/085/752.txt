* * * * *

9. So much of General Orders, Numbers 134, current series, from these headquarters, as directs the entire regiment to rendezvous at Pilot Knob, is hereby so modified as to permit the remaining companies of the regiment (Fiftieth Missouri Infantry) to rendezvous at De Soto for muster into the service.

10. The regiments of Illinois troops (100-days' men) on duty in this department are hereby relieved, and will proceed with a little delay as practicable to the different points where they were mustered in to be mustered out of service. They will remain in camp and report their destination through the proper channels to Colonel L. B. Parsons, chief of transportation, who will see that they are furnished with the necessary transportation. Settlements for issues of clothing, ordnance, and equipments will be governed by the provisions of paragraph 4, Special Orders, Numbers 279, current series, from these headquarters. Colonel Hugo Wangelin, Twelfth Missouri Infantry, will remain in command until all the regiments have been sent home, when he will report to these headquarters for soldiers. The commanding general thanks the officers and soldiers of these regiments for the promptitude with which they responded to his call and for their services.

HEADQUARTERS CITY GUARD,

Saint Louis, October 10, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: Having volunteered my services to aid in perfecting the defense of the city of Saint Louis against a threatened attack from the hostile force now in the State, I proceed, in pursuance of General Orders, 179, from department headquarters, to organize into companies and regiments as desired to take up arms and hold themselves in readiness for duty. The result I have now the honor to report to you in the shape of five regiments, two battalions, and several unattached companies, embracing a force of more than 5,000 well-armed men, most of whom are familiar with drill, and many of whom have served out the period of their enlistments in the volunteer regiments recently mustered out. In regard to one of the battalions that formed at Carondelet, it is proper to state that when reported for muster it consisted of from 300 to 400 men, but owing to some misunderstanding on the part of those enlisted the organization has not yet been completed. Subjoined will be found the oath which was administered to these troops by Major Ledergerber, assigned to these headquarters as mustering officer, and also a roster of the command and map* of the city showing company locations. Authority has been given to form several companies of exempts in the county of Saint Louis, but as they furnish their own arms and equipments it has not been deemed necessary to include them
