mem
Mr BRONSON moved to amend the last line, by striking
out the woid ' untd the further older of Congress," and insert,
in lieu theieof,vl for two years fiora the passage ol this act "
Mr R.IVLS then moved u  commit the bill to the Commit
tee ot Ways md Means, 'with instructions so to amend the
sameai* to disp -ise with the agency of banks m the fiscal ope
rations o! the Goveiement "
Mi R leniarked that these instructions were the aime as
those moved by his colleague from Richmond, (Mr Robkrt
son,) tw > i eais ago, and as the best, die a tilt st, the most con
elusive aigument that could be offered m their behalf, he would
ask to have read his colleague's speech on that occasion Tins
being objected to, Mi R proceeded to sustain the motion him
self, with íefeieuee to the« xisting sute of things and went on
to demonstrate the e\pedieiicy ai d constitutionaUt) of such a
measuie as that piopo&ed He was m favor of a hard money
currency, and wi led to bring it about by gi idual means; He
believed i majority of that House was m favoi ot the divorce
scheme, and he wanted to test the Question, and let thobe who
aieforpe petuatwg the connection betwteia the Government
and the banks come up to the mark He adveited to the change
of his colleague's [Mr RoBPRTbONl position, and examined
Mr RitOne s proiect, now uuvoiatedby his colleague, of a spe
cnl depositt system, demonsuatmg it to be the most objection
able of all the s-chemes devised or agitated Aftei some further
remarks, Mr R called for the yeo> and nays on his amend-
ment, which were oideml
Mr ROBCRisON said he should not then join issue with
his colleague on the qui^non ofconsis ency, ioi he did not hold
himself infallible and aumittedthat his op'iuons had imdeigone
a change He hid witnessed i bat'le oí this kind in the ím nate,
between two much mere piomment men than themselves,
which res Utid in e iclt exposing ínconsis encies on the i ai t o*
