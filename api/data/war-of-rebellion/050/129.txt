HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Near Crawfish Spring, September 19, 1863-1.40 p.m.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I am sending Sheridan's division to Gordon's Mills to occupy the ground just vacated without my knowledge by General Wood. I will retain Negley here until further orders, as I think this point needs great attention, and I do not know how far I am without support on my left. General Wood has gone to my left; how far I do not know. All quiet here thus far. Lieutenant Yaryan reports Bushrod R. Johnson in front of Gordon's Mills.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, September 19, 1863-p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: It is getting very warm in our front. Musketry very heavy. I cannot use my artillery in the dense woods. General Palmer is engaged hotly on my left and driving the enemy.

I have the honor to remain, yours, very truly,

JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Widow Glenn's Spring, September 19, 1863-1.45 p.m.

Major General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN:

Colonel Starling was here just now. I have ordered McCook to relieve you. You will proceed at once to take command of your corps. Make your dispositions as best you can. Cheer them up; see that their ammunition is right. Sheridan will come in if necessary on your right, leaving a nominal force to cover your rear. Take care of your right.

By command Major-General Rosecrans:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Near Crawfish Spring, September 19, 1863-2 p.m.

Brigadier-General MITCHELL,

Commanding Cavalry:

General McCook directs me to state that it is absolutely necessary for you to dispatch a portion of your force down Chattanooga Valley to dispose of some rebel cavalry reported there, and to close down this way to our right with the remained of your force. General Negley, on our right, is ordered to be withdrawn immediately, and your force will have to closely cover the right. All goes favorably thus far on the left.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Chief of Staff.
