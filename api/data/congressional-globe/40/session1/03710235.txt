THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

They will then be able to take care of them-
selves, and will neither need nor solicit alms-
Sir, in my humble opinion, the Congress of
the United States will best discharge its whole
duty to the Constitution, to humanity, to a
Christian civilization, and to a wise and noble
statesmanship, by according to the southern
people, standing as organized and legitimate
States within the Union, all their political
rights, and all their just powers of local self-
government, as equal members of the confed-
eracy. To do this would, indeed, be a heavenly
charity; not as a humiliating gift, not as an
unsolicited donation, not as an indifferent alms
by the wayside; but in the spirit of that higher
and broader charity which pertains to masses
of men rather than to individuals, and which
recognizes the principles of justice and ignores
all sense of wrong and oppression. A policy
like this would do more to heal the great
wounds of the country, more to inaugurate
peace and harmony and mutual respect among
the distracted sections, than if you were to pour
out the entire treasure of the nation as an alms
to a proud and high-spirited people.
I am at a loss, Mr. Chairman, to understand
the motive and the spring of action which
impels the other side of the House, although
they are somewhat divided in their position as
to the bill now before us, to propose to vote
ยง1,000,000 to a people whom they have op-
pressed by a studied system of hostile legisla-
tion unparalleled in modern times. Is it in-
tended as some reparation for the wrongs thus
inflicted upon them? Is it, at last, compensa-
tion rather than charity? Is reaction in the
Republican mind, like reaction in all other
over-excitements, whether moral or physical,
about to take place, and thus restore the pop-
ular feeling to that normal condition of quiet
and repose so well Calculated to bring about
a good understanding between parties now hos-
tile and belligerent? If there is any feeling
of this sort connected with this measure on
the part of those who advocate this bill as
members of the party on the other side of the
House, why not frankly apply the real remedy
at once, with straightforward directness and
earnestness? Several gentlemen on the Re-
publican side put the merits of this bill upon
the ground that it would tend to bring about
reconstruction and reconciliation. If that is
a thing desired by our friends on the other side
of the Hall, or by a portion of them, there is
a much more effectual mode of accomplishing
the object. Repeal your Freedmen's Bureau
bills, your civil rights bills, your negro suf-
frage bills, and your military reconstruction
bills, and you will do more to reunite a divided
people, more to put the country on the high-
road to prosperity and greatness, more to re-
invigorate all the channels of trade, of com-
merce. and of the industrial arts, than you can
by all the money you can create by paper-mills
and steam printing-presses, when applied in
the way of a loose and indefinite charity to a
people who are too proud to acknowledge or
even accept the favor as an alms, and who are
too much broken down by political oppression
to be permanently benefited by its reception.
For these reasons, sir, and for many more
which might be enumerated, I shall earnestly
and conscientiously record my vote against
the passage of the bill.
Mr. WOOD. The honorable gentleman from
Ohio yields to me the residue of his time. It
is not tny intention, sir, to prolong this debate
to any length. I wish merely to present six
reasons which influence my mind and which
determine roe to vote against the passage of
the pending joint resolution. I shall not elab-
orate these points or detain the committee from
proceeding to an immediate vote.
Mr. Chairman, I will not vote for the pend-
ing joint resolution for the following reasons:
First, Because Congress has no power un-
der the Constitution to make appropriations of
public money for charitable purposes ;
Second, Because neither the southern States
nor people have applied to Congress or the
Government for such aid ;
Third, Because the arguments which have
been advanced in this House in favor of the
appropriation by those who have participated
in passing treasures destructive of the political
rights of the southern States and oppressive
of the southern people place the gift proposed
on grounds insulting and derogatory;
Fourth, Because the money will be disbursed
through the agency of the Freedmen's Bureau,
whose agents in many cases are not only un-
safe custodians of public money, but disquali-
fied by prejudice against the white people of
the South to make an impartial distribution
of funds for charitable purposes ;
Fifth, Because the sudden philanthropy of
those who propose this measure at this time,
immediately preceding the southern elections,
is calculated to excite suspicion that political
and not benevolent motives lie at the bottom
of the proposition;
Sixth, And because the Freedmen's Bureau
has already over two million one hundred
thousand dollars to its credit unexpended,
which can be used by its chief to relieve any
cases of actual want that may exist among the
southern people.
Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, without any
attempt to go into any discussion explanatory
of them, I shall vote against the pending meas-
ure. I state very broadly and explicitly that
either one of them would prevent this measure
from receiving my vote.
Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I desire
that the committee shall come to a vote upon
this question, and I now offer an additional
proviso to come in after that offered by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Banks.]
The CHAIRMAN. The pending amend-
ment, as. offered by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr. Baxks,] will first be read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Provided. That there shall bo expended from the
appropriation herein made, under the direction of the
Commissioner of Agriculture, tlie sum of 850,000 for
the purchase of seeds, to be distributed among the
destitute people of tho South by the Commissioner of
the Freedmen's Bureau.
Mr. BINGHAM. I move to add the follow-
ing proviso:
And provided further, That no part of tho money
herein appropriated shall bo used tor the purposes
aforesaid until the unexpended appropriations here-
tofore made by existing law for the iwe of the Freed-
men's Bureau shall have been first applied to the
purposes herein specified, under the direction of the
Commissioner of said bureau.
Mr. BINGHAM. The committee will see,
if this proviso is incorporated in the resolution,
not one cent can be drawn from tlie Treasury
for the purpose specified in the original Senate
resolution until all the money unappropriated
by existing laws for the use of the Freedmen's
Bureau shall have been first applied to the pur-
pose specified in the original resolution, to wit,
to supply the wants of the destitute and fam-
ishing in the southern and southwestern States.
Mr. SCHENCK. If I uudeistood my col-
league, he would take it away from tlie loyal
and give it to the disloyal.
Mr. BINGHAM. I regret very much that
my colleague labors under so stiange a hallu-
cination. The gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Stevens] yesterday reminded the House
truly that in the appropriation made in the
several cases passed in the Thirty-Ninth Con-
gress there was no limitation to the loyal; and
lie stated also very truly that in the expendi-
ture of that money the disloyal who happened
to be refugees within the meaning of those
statutes were provided for by the Freedmen's
Bureau.
But the occasion for this enlargement, Mr.
Chairman, is this: there are large numbers of
poor whites, as they are known in the several
States of the South, who are not refugees ; and
I undertake to say a majority_of those who
are now suffering never were disloyal to your
flag, who cannot be relieved at all by your
existing laws, even though the existing appro-
priation were sufficient for that purpose, for
the reason that those laws restrict the Freed-
men's Bureau to the use of funds for the re-
lief first of freedmen, that is to say, men who
have been slaves, and second of refugees, that
is to say, men who are in the sense of that
word refugees escaping.
Mr. SCHENCK. I will answer my col-
league, if he will allow trie to interrupt him.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. I ask to
be allowed to make an explanation, as the gen-
tleman referred to me.
Mr. BINGHAM. Certainly.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. When we
tablished the E'reedmen's Bureau -
i we appro-
priated several million dollars, since which
time we have appropriated about twelve mil-
lion dollars for the same purpose, for the
freedmen and refugees. It did not mean loyal
or disloyal; it meant refugees who were suffer-
ing, whether they were loyal or disloyal; and
upon the reports, so far as 1 have observed them
lately, in many parts of the country about three
fourths of the persons fed were white refugees.
That far the statement of the gentleman is
true. Now, I do not see any reason why they
should nqt go on the same way, unless you want
to bring in a class of sturdy beggars to be fed.
Mr. SCHENCK. I understand my colleague
to have yielded to me for a moment. I wish
to be understood about this matter in the
remark I made about giving preference to the
disloyal. If my colleague will look at General
Howard's report he will find that what we call
the Bureau of Freedmen is in fact by law a
Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Aban-
doned Lands. He will find, too, in the provisions
made for the relief to be given under the bureau
as thus organized by law some ten or twelve
million dollars have already been given. It is
the practice to give, in the first place, as a mat-
ter of course, to the freedmen, for tlicy are
named, not by preference to others, but there
is a distinction made by the general epithet,
and I suppose I may appeal to my colleague to
know whether they belong to the loyal class
rather than the disloyal. In the next place to
the sefugces, and I admit without stating
whether they are loyal or disloyal. Practi-
cally, every starving man, woman, or child who
has come to the bureau asking for rations has
been treated as a refugee, and has .received
these rations, and the returns from Richmond
and other points, where three whites to one
negro were fed by rations issued under the
direction of the Freedmen's Bureau, will show
that no inquiry was made beyond the fact
whether they were needy or not.
General Howard, near the close of his report,
says that for all these purposes the $5,000,000
last appropriated is ample. What, then, further
is asked? That somebody who has not been
thus fed, that somebody who is not a freedman
or a refugee, who is not a destitute man, woman,
or child, who has come petitioning for rations,
shall be taken care of; and, if I understand
it, it can only be the sturdy disloyalist, too lazy
to work, but still wanting to be supported at
the expense of the Government of the United
States.
Mr. BINGHAM. I am very much obliged
to my colleague โข [Mr. Schesck] for making
the statement he has made, and I intend,
too, that he shall be understood. He has
stated here now in the hearing of the com-
mittee that no starving man or woman or
child, whether loyal or disloyal, has been
denied relief by the Freedmen's Bureau. If
that be the case, then, if the gentleman favors
that conduct of the bureau, he cannot object
to the amendment which I have offered, which
requires the bureau in the future not to inquire
whether the starving poor have been loyal or
disloyal. And that being the case, I would like
to know what becomes of the objection of my
colleague, that we propose to transfer this fund
from the loyal to the disloyal ? And in this
connection 1 beg leave to say further that in
the report to which my colleague has referred
General Howard has notified the Congress of
the United States that not merely Bl.0u0.000,
but SI,-500.000 additional will be needed for
this purpose ; and yet I feel n1 liberty to ^ay
this much, that General Howard
