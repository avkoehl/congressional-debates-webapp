WAR DEPARTMENT

Washington City, February 11, 1863.

Honorable EDWIN D. MORGAN,

New York:

SIR: In answer to a letter handed by you to the Honorable C. P. Wolcott, late Assistant Secretary of War, I have the honor to inform you that your resignation as major-general of volunteers was dully accepted on the 27th of December, 1862, to take on the 1st day of January, 1863, agreeably to your own request.

The Secretary instructs me to say that he has delayed sending you the usual routine notification of acceptance, hoping that the pressure of urgent public business might be so far relaxed as to afford him an opportunity to acknowledge in fitting terms his sense of the hearty co-operation and valuable assistance he uniformly received from you as Governor of New York and as a military officer in the service of the United States. The pressure of public duties has become so great at to deprive him of all of being able to write in person, and you therefore merely receive this note of acceptance.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
