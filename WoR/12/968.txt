In the execution of this or(ler the three right conupaines became detached, but were gallantly led by Lieutenant-Col- onel Johnston across the Williamsburg road, and co-o~)erati11g with the Fourth North Carolina, charged in the direction of the battery in the rc(loltbt, officers and men acting nobly bitt suffbring terribly. Having passed the opening and the abatis ~vith what was left of my counmamid, with a part of the Twenty-fourth Virginia I again pressed for~vai~~l, the enemy fighting bitt giving way. The swampy earth and thick undergrowth continued to check rapid movement. The Second Florida, on my left, was hard pressed. When the Forty-ninth Virginia came up cheering upon our right the enemy began again to give way an(l our line went forward. About this time my horse was shot, and in ihiling with him I was so much injitred as to be incompetent for fttrther service. All the field officers and two-thirds of the company officers were now hors de combat, but several officers and many of the ntemi joined other commands and fonght on until night closed the engagement.
