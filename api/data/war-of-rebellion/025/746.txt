Major General EARL VAN DORN, Abbeville, Miss.:

I have just received the following telegram, viz:

I have pretty information that Federal forces are crossing Tennessee River and going toward Nashville. The force left at Corinth is exceedingly small.

C. R. BARTEAU.

Send at once reliable persons to ascertain any movement of enemy from Grand Junction, Davis' Mill, &amp;c; also from Corinth. Direct the scouts to be as prompt as possible and report only what is reliable.

ABBEVILLE, November 11, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Dispatch from Colonel Starke informs me that 2,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and 4 pieces artillery encamped last night 12 miles north of Hernando. I have ordered Jackson to send out scouts in their rear to ascertain definitely what force is in that road. Heard yesterday that Memphis had been re-enforced. Will send a brigade mounted Texans and battery to-morrow morning to crossings above Panola unless your order me to the contrary. All quiet in front. Holly Springs in our possession.
