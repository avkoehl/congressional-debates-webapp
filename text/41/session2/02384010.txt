THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 2,
sideration. I feel that it is my duty now to
object to its passage by this body 
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. If this is to lead
to debate I must interpose. I suppose it was
not the intention of the Senator from New
Hampshire to push it if it led to debate.
Mr. CRAGIN. > I will not ask the further
consideration of the bill if it is likely to lead
to any lengthy debate.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I call for the
regular order.
Mr. SPENCER. I ask unanimous consent
to take up Senate bill No. 446. It is a local
measure that affects my State, and there can
be no earthly objection to it. It is very short,
and it will not take a minute to read it. I ask
unanimous consent to take up the bill.
Mr. ANTHONY. I wish the Senate would
take a vote on the bill called up by the Senator
from New Hampshire.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I understood
the Senator from New Hampshire called it up
with the understanding that it would not lead
to debate, and I suggested whether it was
desirable to proceed further with it.
Mr. ANTHONY. I am not in charge of
the bill; the Senator from New Hampshire has
charge of it; but I think it rather a hard case
when we are giving away land by sections and
counties and States, and empires almost, to
speculative companies, that here, when a com-
pany comes and merely asks the privilege to
manage its own possessions in the same way
that any individual would have the right to
manage them if he owned them alone, and
when the object is to bring into the country a
desirable immigration, it should meet this oppo-
sition.
Sir. TRUMBULL. I should like to ask the
Senator from Rhode Island one question. In
any State of this Union did he ever know of a
corporation created with authority to purchase
real estate and hold it to any extent it thought
proper ?
Mr. DRAKE. And sell it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. And sell it when it
pleased or hold it as Jong as it pleased. It was
never done in my State. A corporation is
always limited, banks and everything else, to
the purchase of such real estate as is necessary
to carry on their business.
Mr. NYE. That is what this is.
Mr. TRUMBULL. No; this is to author-
ize the purchase of the whole territory. I never
heard of such a proposition.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Question!
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pome-
koy in the chair.) The Senator irora Maine
insists on the regular order, which is the In-
dian appropriation bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Before we proceed with
the bill I wish to congratulate the Senator from
Maine on having by his good nature lost twenty
minutes in the consideration of this bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. It was not my
good nature; it was the good nature of the
Senator from Vermont.
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe an amendment
of half a dozen words can make the bill accept-
able to everybody. The Senator from Vermont
can put it in, I think.
^Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Let us proceed
with the regular order.
presidential approvals.
A message from the President of the United
Stales, by Mr. Horace Porter, his Secretary,
announced that the President had, on the 1st
instant, approved and signed the following act
and joint resolution:
A bill (S. No. 7G) concerning divorces in the
District of Columbia ; and
A joint resolution (S. R. No. 120) to provide
for the appointment of an examiner of claims
for the Department of State, and for additional

indian appropriation" bill.
The Senate, as in "Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the bill (H. R.
No. 1169) making appropriations for the cur-
rent and contingent expenses of the Indian
Department and for fulfilling treaty stipula-
tions (so called) with various Indian tribes for
the year ending June 30, 1871, and for other
purposes.
Mr. MORRILL, of Mainer" Before the read-
ing of the bill is proceeded with I desire to
correct the text in line nine hundred and forty-
nine ; after the word "of" insert "two," and
the letter "s" after "school;" so as to read
'' for support of two manual-labor schools.'' โข
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That cor-
rection will be made.
The Secretary continued the reading of the
bill.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was on page 03, line fifteen
hundred and forty-two, after the word "dol-
lars," in the clause making an appropriation
for the Yancton tribe of Sioux, to add the fol-
lowing proviso :
Provided, That the Secretary of the Interior, with
the consent of any tribe of Indians, may use such
portion of their annuities, appropriated by this act
for the purchase of provisions, as in his judgment
the necessities of said tribe may require.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 04, line
fifteen hundred and sixty-three, to strike out
"75" and insert " 100," so as to make the ap-
propriation for the general incidental expenses
of the Indian service in California $100,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 05, line
fifteen hundred and ninety-two, to strike out
"15" and insert "30;" so as to make the
appropriation for the general incidental ex-
penses of the Indian service in Montana Terri-
tory ยง30,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page G8, line
sixteen hundred and fifty-one, to strike out
"o" and insert "10;" so that the clause will
read:
For insurance, transportation, anu necessary ex-
penses of the delivery of annuities and provisions
to the Indian tribes in Minnesota and Michigan,
$10,0U0.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 68, lino
sixteen hundred and fifty-eight, to strike out
the word "and" and to insert "or."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page G8, line
sixteen hundred and sixty-nine, to insert after
the word "stocks" the words "as follows."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was on page 70, at the
end of the first section to add the following
proviso :
Provided, That upon annuities and interest of
trust funds provided by treaties no taxes shall in
any case be assessed or collected.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. The intention
of the committee was to move to strike out
the second section. It is a misprint in not
being so reported. I move that the section
be stricken out.
The Chief Cleric. It is proposed to strike
out the second section, in the following words:
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That nothing in
this act contained, or in any of the provisions there-
of, shall be so construed as to ratify or approve any
treaty made with any tribes, bands, or parties of
Indians sinco the 20th day of July, 1867.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was to add as an additional
section the following:
And be it further enacted. That no part of the
moneys appropriated by this act to pay annuities
due to or to be used and expended for the care and
benefit of any tribe or tribes of Indians named herein
shall be applied to the payment of any claim for
depredations that may have been committed by such
tribe or tribes, or any member or members thereof
prior to the passage of this act; and all acts and
parts of acts inconsistent liBrswitii &ro hero by rG-
pealed.
Mr. HARLAN. The Committee on Indian
Affairs haveinstructed me to propose to amend
that amendment. In line two, after the word
"act," I move to insert " or which may here-
after be appropriated in any general act or
deficiency bill making appropriations for the
current and contingent expenses of the Indian
department."
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the amendment to the amendment
proposed by the Senator from Iowa.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I ask that it be
reported again.
The Chiei' Clerk. The amendment to the
amendment is to insert in line two, after the
word "act," the words " or which may here-
after be appropriated in any general act or
deficiency bill making appropriations for the
current and contingent expenses of the Indian
department."
Mr. HARLAN. The next two of the printed
amendments of the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs should be read in connection with that,
to explain the meaning of the committee.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Let it be read
all together with those amendments, so that we
can see how it stands.
The Chief Clerk. It is also proposed to
amend the amendment by inserting in line five,
after the words "have been," the words "or
may be;" so that the section will read :
That no part of the moneys a,pproprinted by this
act, or which may hereafter be appropriated in any
general act or deficiency bill making appropriations
for the current or contingent expenses of the Indian
department, to pay annuities due to or to be used
and expended for the care and benefit of any tribe
or tribes of Indians named herein, shall be applied
to the payment of any claim for depredations that
may have been or may be committed by such tribe
or tribes, or any member or members thereof, prior
to the passage of this act; and all acts and parts of
acts inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I suggest to my
honorable friend from Iowa that so far as his
amendment is prospective and relates to future
acts it would be inoperative. It is hardly com-
petent for Congress to say in this bill what shall
take place in regard to future bills. If I un-
derstand the purpose of the amendment, it is
that none of these funds shall be appropriated
to a particular purpose, nor shall they be ap-
propriated by any other act that may hereafter
be passed. So far as it relates to the future,
of course it would be inoperative.
Mr. HARLAN. The object of the commit-
tee was to prescribe a rule for the regulation
of the department so as to prevent hereafter
the allowance of any claim for depredations
without first submitting it to Congress, and I
suppose it is competent for Congress to enact
such a law. Of course any future Congress
could repeal it.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. It would clearly
be inoperative so far as it refers to any future
act. But if the object is to furnish a rule for
the department, then I submit the Senator
will accomplish that object by saying that no
payment shall be made for any of these claims
out of any future appropriation "unless ex-
pressly authorized by law."
Mr. HARLAN. I should have no objection
to that modification of the amendment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. That would pre-
vent any payment by the department, and
would furnish a rule to the department which
perhaps would accomplish all that the Senator
desires.
Mr. HARLAN". The committee supposed
that they had effected that purpose by the last
clause of their amendmentand which I observe
now the Secretary has not read. In line seven
of this section, the committee propose to strike
out the words "prior to the passage of this
act," and to insert the words " and no claims
for Indian depredations shall hereafter be paid
until Congress shall make special appropria-
tions therefor." That will prevent the absorp-
tion of the appropriations in general appropria-
tion bills for the payment of claims.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I have no objec-
