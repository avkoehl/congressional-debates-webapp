VALLEY EAST OF ROCKY FACE, May 9, 1864-1.40 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Tunnel Hill:

I am confronting the enemy, my right connecting strongly with Newton, and my line extending obliquely across the valley to the main Dalton road. The enemy appears to be in force. I am feeling forward to ascertain how strong. As yet my skirmishers only are engaged. I will push the enemy as far back as practicable. May I expect re-enforcements if I meet a superior force, or is it intended that I simply do what I can alone? General Cox now confronts the defenses which I saw yesterday. I am about going forward to examine the ground. McCook's cavalry has been driven back from the Cleveland and Dalton road onto the ridge this side of the railroad. One of his brigades pretty badly handled. The force in front of him seems to be only cavalry and mounted infantry. I have sent a regiment of infantry to support him, and hope to be able to protect my left and rear.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BUZZARD ROOST, May 9,1 864-3 p. m.

General SCHOFIELD:o

I do not want you to encounter field-works but to keep the enemy employed to give McPherson a change. I do not want to re-enforce you, but keep near strong ground and Newton's division. Tell McCook to maneuver and not keep in any one place. Send an officer back to hurry up Stoneman, who should be near at hand. He can get forage now at Tunnel Hill. Stoneman should be this side of Cleveland.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I send Captain Poe to connect your position with ours as to the easiest line of march.

MAY 9, 1864-3.10 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Tunnel Hill:

GENERAL: McCook reports a heavy column of infantry confronting him to the east of Smith's, where Hovey's left was last night. The column came up the road to the east of the railroad, drove McCook across the hills, and was approaching the valley in which runs the railroad. I have one regiment of infantry supporting McCook and cannot well send more at present. Can you send any from other commands? If you do, left them march through Tunnel Hill Gap toward Varnell's.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Tunnel Hill, May 9, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Major McCoy is just back. I want you to have a strong defensive position before daylight. One division in good contrast with Howard's
