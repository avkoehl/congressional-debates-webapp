SIR: I HAVE THE HONOR TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING REPORT OF THE PART TAKEN BY THE TROOPS UNDER MY COMMAND IN THE ACTION OF THE 9TH [AT BEVERLY FORD]: TWO-THIRDS OF THE INFANTRY CROSSED THE FORD AFTER THE CAVALRY, AND MOVED UP THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE FRONT AND CENTER OF OUR LINE. THE EDGE OF THE WOODS WE OCCUPIED SOON AFTER THE ENEMY'S CAVALRY ADVANCED UPON US; AFTERWARD ATTACKS WERE MADE BY HIS DISMOUNTED CAVALRY, BUT IN EACH INSTANCE HE WAS REPULSED, WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS. AT 11 A. M. OUR ENTIRE LINE ADVANCED. IN THE AFTERNOON ALL OF MY AVAILABLE FORCE MOVED TOWARD A RIDGE OF HILLS ON OUR RIGHT. BY THIS MOVEMENT A VERY SUPERIOR FORCE OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY AND CAVALRY WAS DISCOVERED. A SECTION OF THE ARTILLERY CROSSED THE RIVER WITH THE INFANTRY, AND WAS ENGAGED FIRST ON THE LEFT, AFTERWARD ON THE RIGHT. THE REMAINING TWO SECTIONS CROSSED LATER IN THE DAY, AS DID THE INFANTRY LEFT ON THIS SIDE, MOVED TO THE EXTREME FRONT, AND ENGAGED THE ENEMY. MY COMMAND WAS WITHDRAWN UNMOLESTED. MY FORCES WERE AS FOLLOWS: THE EIGHTY-SIXTH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS, MAJOR LANSING; ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOURTH NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL CUMMINS, COMMANDED BY COLONEL ELLIS, OF THE THIRD CORPS; THE THIRTY-THIRD MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEERS, COLONEL UNDERWOOD, OF THE ELEVENTH CORPS;
