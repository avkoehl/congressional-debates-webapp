such would have been the result had the im-
provements actually been of any value what-
ever, and not, as they mainly were, an abso-
lute damage. Deducting this one third, al-
though it is as much a debt as any other form of
obligation, and as onerous an imposition on the
property-holders, there is left $5,481,997.
Prom this, in the official estimates, a de-
duction has been made of twenty per cent, for
cash, but as no one could either explain or
understand this, and as in point of fact the
expenses in all operations which have been
advanced toward completion overran the sums
allowed, there is no propriety in taking it into
consideration. If therefore we take this
$8,222,996 and add to .it the old city debts
$3,756,381, the Piedmont railroad $600,000,
the water loan $450,000, the market bonds
$300,000, and the Chicago relief bonds
$100,000, we have a grand total of $18,429,377.
Of this over nine million five hundred thou-
sand dollars has been incurred in seven months.
Does the history of our country contain any-
thing like such extravagance? One tenth of
the entire property of the District disposed of
in little more than half a year. In ten years a
similar course would annihilate the total value,
real and personal, of the possessions of the
present residents. Taxes of the most onerous
description must follow inevitably, and the
assessments will bo so heavy that much prop-
erty must change hands, and many persons in
moderate circumstances will lose their worldly
all, as their estates will be sold to pay the
liens upon them thus created. So remarkable
lias been the improvement of the city that many
persons have before them the immediate pros-
pect of being improved out of house and home.
A false impression is attempted to be given
as to the rate of taxation. The rate for the
fiscal year closing June 1, 1872, is put forward
as though that would be the amount main-
tained in future, and was a justestimateof the
sum made necessary by. the outlays of the
past year. The fact, however, is that the Dis-
trict has been borrowing, so far, and has not
yet begun to pay either principal or interest,
the first installment of interest on the loan
having not yet fallen due.
Nothing is so easy and pleasant as running
in debt, and if a big debt is a large blessing,
the District of Columbia is blessed beyond all
other parts of the earth. The debt of the city
of New York is $100,000,000 on an assess-
ment of capital not exceeding two thirds of
its true value, reaching a thousand millions
and with a vast commerce and growing re-
sources to meet deficiencies, while these two
citiesof Washington and Georgetown, with their
surrounding country and poverty-stricken and
sparsely inhabited environs, have a debt of at
least $12,000,000 on an excessive valuation of
$89,225,615, or over thirteen per cent., with-
out trade or other resources to assist in the
work of payment. The rate of assessment in
New York is nearly three per cent., and that
makes the subjects of Tammany spoliation
groan, but the burden will be far heavier upon
the victims of the Board of Public Works of
the city of Washington. The true estimate is
as follows:
For the District fund $0 70
Lighting the city  15
Metropolitan police    20
Xhu public schools      60
The ten-year bonds      10

In addition to the appropriations named in
the foregoing statement, there were sixteen in-
definite appropriations made at the first regular
session, and two at the second special session,
which in the aggregate will probably amount
to $500,000.
William M. Tweed once passed a charter
for the city of New York, which provided that
