HDQRS. 5TH MIL. DIST., DEPT. OF S. C., GA., AND FLA.,[March 4, 1864.]

GENERAL: I have the honor to report herewith the total number of shots fired at this city since November 16. Some few (say 30) were fired previous to this date.

I here take occasion to call to your attention the conduct of the fire department since the commencement of the siege. Since November 16, fires have frequently (almost daily) occurred, and the promptitude and th alacrity with which the fire department has responded cannot be too much praised. The enemy has always shelled rapidly whenever a fire has occurred; but this has not deterred the firemen from the discharge of their duties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED RHETT,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN.

[Inclosure.]
