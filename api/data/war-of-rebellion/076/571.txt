In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 18, 1864.

General THOMAS:

There are always at the bridge enough troops in the shape of train guards and wagon escorts, but it is proper some one colonel should be known as the commanding officer. You may name one and instruct him to picket well up the river, and on any alarm to hold the signal hill over Vining's, and the redoubts at the bridge, and make it his duty to notify you of anything worthy of your attention.

Major-General, Commanding.

No change in the appearance of things upon the rebel side in front of the Fourth Corps.

General THOMAS:

Both Generals Howard and Schofield report the enemy to their front unchanged. I don't understand why the wires are down between Vining's and Marietta. Can you signal to Kenesaw and ask if all is right? As auxiliary we had better keep up signals from your headquarters to signal hill, or Vining's, Kenesaw's, and Allatoona.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

August 18, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have officers enough to establish stations here at Vining's and Marietta or Kenesaw. If General Howard can send a couple to Allatoona we can have a complete line as far as that point. I ordered up ammunition early this morning, and the big guns will continue firing as soon as it arrives.

General THOMAS:

I will order General Howard to establish a signal station on the hill at Allatoona in correspondence with one at Kenesaw.
