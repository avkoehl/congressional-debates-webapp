glass of that bijou, of a church situated at the head
of Broadway. Theie is a little anecdote con-
nected with that church, that I recollect having
read in some New York paper, not many years
since. It seems that, a few years a^o, there was
a venerable old church, whose antiquity lent a
religious awe to the devout who frequented its
hallowed precincts, situated on Broadway, below
Wall street. Its devotees and attendants were
mostly of the poorer class of people. The more
wealthy of Grace church parish—for that was the
name of this venerable edifice—had moved to the
more fashionable and aristocratic part of the city.
But these pious, but poor people, were not left
long to enjoy the Sunday instruction of their pas-
tor. The land became valuable, and mammon
wanted, and mammon got it. The edifice was
sold, and the proceeds invested in the beautiful
structure I have referred to. When it was com-
pleted, however, it was so beautiful that it soon
became the fashionable resort, and all its seats were
secured at fabulous prices by the wealthy. Its
magnificent front and marble columns spoke more
legibly than blazing capitals, " No poor man can
enter Ibcret" &xid the poor of Grace church were
excluded from its doors.
The trustees of this temple then decided to build
a modest chapel at the side of this splendid edi-
fice, for the exclusive use of the poor of the con-
gregation. Now, by poor is not meant the pau-
pers, but only the less wealthy—the tradespeople.
Well, no sooner did this building for the poor
begin to raise its head above the ground than its i
purpose was announced in the New York papers j
under the head of "Two road^ to heaven—one i
for the rich, another for the poor." The rich j
were expected to go through the high portals of j
Grace church, and the poor by the little door of !
the side chapel. The satire was too severe, and j
the trustees converted the chapel for the poor into j
a parsonage. This conversion called for a news-
paper remark, that Grace church trustees had
closed even the side windows of heaven to the
poor. Now, if the effect of magnificent churches
be the same elsewhere as it ^eems to have been
in New York, I am inchncd to think every one
will agree with me, that the fewer magnificent,
expensive, luxurious churches we have, the bet-
ter. In the South, "the poor have the Gospel
preached to them."
I hold—and I think the gentleman from Illinois
will agree with me—that the value of church prop-
erty is not to be the evidence of the intensity and
extent of religious feeling; but that the facilities
afforded by church accommodation are only the
evidences of the efforts of a State to spread the
benign influences of religious instruction.
On pages 136 and 137, census 1850, it appears
that the total church accommodations in the Uni-
ted States were 14,270,139. In the slavehol4mg
States 5,606,995—leaving 4,057,661 persons, of
all classes, without church accommodation, or
rather, without a seat m church. In the North, j
there were 8,603,144 seats, leaving 4,868,076 per- |
sons without seats, being 806,415 more persons at ,
the North than at the South without church seats. !
Again, at the South, the value of church accom- j
modation was only about twenty-two million 1
dollars, being just four dollars a seat; whereas |
at the North, the church accommodations costj
$.67,000,000—near eight dollars a seat. The fact
then stands, that we have more church accommo- j
dations at the South than you have at the North, ;
and at just half the expense for each seat; and if j
there is anything to our discredit m this, we are j
willing to Sear it. I
On the next day after this speech by the gen- j
tleman from Illinois—the 23d—the member from :
New York [Mr. Pottle] comes in with an echo
of the same retarding influences of negro servi-
tude. He says:
u These effects are no longer matter of doubt or specula-
tion. Gentlemen may talk about the value ol their annual \
pioduct of cotton and sugar. What do such facts weigh 1
against the comparison of States side by side—in wealth, |i
in population, in schools, in general intelligence, in all the |
coaitorts and blessings of lite ? Weigh Vngima against >
Pennsylvania, Kentucky against Ohio, and the -.lave States .:
which have been admitted since the formation of the Gov- j
eminent against the free States admitted withm the same ;!
time, and dii?\ver the question foi yourselves. There is no j
chance for mistake here; for, in soil,in climate, in every- |
thing, you had the advantage ; and yet, with ail these, how j
far you have fallen behind!" j
The member from Wisconsin, [Mr. Potrer,] ;i
i following suit, on the same day, says, after a
' sweeping charge of general corruption:
" Such are the demoralizing influences of slavery, which
seeks to establish and extend its power throughout the length
and breadth of this continent—a power which exhausts the
life and vigor of commonwealths \ destroys the prosperity
1 of nations; corrupts the principles of parties; debases and
brutalizes its victims j and drags down to its own leveUof
barbarism all that yield to its embrace."
On the next day, the 24th—for we have been
dosed with it nearly every day—the member from
Indiana, [Mr. Kilgore,] to show that he was as
safe on the "nigger question" as any of them,
tells us:
" i was born and reared in a slave State, and 1 am pioud
of the State of my nativity, for it is one of the noblest of
the old slave States of this Union. She has furnished he-
roes to the field, and statesmen to the council of the nation.
It is the land of the lamented Clay. But, as f said, I now
represent heie a free interest. The State of my adoption
is suriounded with everything that is calculated to endear
me to free institutions. When I contrast the state of things
there with what I learn of the condition of the extreme
southern States, I am proud of my position. How do we
stand ? We have our free schools; we have our churches;
we have our academies; we have our charitable institu-
tions for the benefit of the deaf nnd dumb, the blind, and
the insane. We have our thousands of miles of railroads,
our fields teeming with abundance, our thriving towns, our
flourishing cities—everything to endear us to our home.
Can those gentlemen who have denounced us on tins floor
as Abolitionists, as much for themselves?"
And then came the member from Massachu-
setts, [Mr. Buffinton, I believe,] on the same
day, declaring of this African servitude, that
(% It is a curse upon any State where it exists; it affects
all the relations of a community, internal and external; it
is a blight upon moral and social progress; it affects all the
material intere&ts; it depresses the value of lands; it dis-
couiages and debases free laboi; and gives the political
control and social predominance to a few aristocratic pro-
prietors of slaves; itretaids and prevent5? the development
of all the rcj,ources of a State, and is a withering blight
upon its pro>perity."
To cap the climax, the member from Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr. Covode,] on the 26th instant, thus
delivers himself. Hear him:
" The friends of slavery are in the habit of pointing to the
large expoits of the South—they can no longer point to Us
large imports—as evidence of the superior wealth of that
section. They expoit everything valuable which they pro-
duce, and import, either from Europe or from the North, ev-
erything except necessaries which they consume; and this,
su, is the ground of then boasted wealth, independence, and
civilization ! I am amazed, sir, that a moment's ipfleption
lias not taught them the contrary. Is it not clear that a coun-
try which produces only the law materials of commerce,
winch only cultivates the ground, is m a condition of colo-
nial dependence ? Such sif, is tiic condition ot the South.
She pioduccs the bulk of our exports, and yet she has never,
at any penod of her history, expoired them. iiven when a
majority of the exports was made fiom southern porN, the
tiade was earned on by northern or European ships and sea-
men. But for s,ome years past the South has fallen behind
the North in the amount of exports. The impoits have al-
ways been in northern hands. The North sends its ships to
New Orleans and Charleston, transports their cotton, to-
bacco, sugar, and rice to Euiope, ami bungs back return
cargoes of merchandise to New York, Boston, and Philadel-
phia; and from these points the South is .supplied with for-
eign or notthern inanufactuie^. Sir, the condition of the
South is strictly one of colonial dependence. She pioduccs
the veiy aaple* of commerce ; she has fine haibors, fine
timber lor ship-building ; m a word, every material element
of commerce; but they are of no avail. The ignoiancc and
barbarism of slavery havo doomed her to an inferior and
dependent condition."
Now, Mr. Chairman, all these gentlemen have
declared themselves our sincere friends, and good
lovers of the Union; but not being able to divine
or appreciate the reasons impelling to such strange
ways of exhibiting regard and love, I shall not fol-
low their example, but content myself with the
old-fashioned notion that the best way of making
and preserving friends, and accomplishing our
purposes, is to speak in all kindness to and of
each other, and be always ready to perform such
friendly offices as circumstances may enable us
to render.
It is said that " figures will not lie;" and I will
now proceed with my principal purpose m seek-
ing the floor to-day. But, sir, I shall contrast no
one State with another, the least prosperous of
one section against the most prosperous of the
other section. That will do well enough for clap-
trappery on the stump, to arouse sectional ani-
mosity or party feeling. I shall put the whole
North against the entire South, and then let him
strike the balance who can to our disparagement.
I invite my friends on both sides of the House to
follow mc in my statements, and to correct any
errors I may make.
I have taken as authorities, the census of 1850,
and the report of the Secretary of the Treasury
for 1357, on commerce and navigation. I state
as an undeniable fact, that the agricultural pro-
ductions of the southern States for the year 1850,
show that each inhabitant, of all classes, produced
$13 30 more than each individual at the North. i
state that the average agricultural productions at
the South was $58 to each person, when at the
North it was only $44 70. From the table that
i have prepared, showing the products of differ-
ent kinds in all the States, i read that the total
agricultural productions for 1850, amounted to
$1,164,457,783—say $1,164,000,000. And of this
sum, the North produced, in round numbers,
$604,000,000, and the South $560,000,000.
I will now continue the tables on the agricul-
tural productions.
Total value agricultural products, $1,164,457,783
Total value agricultural products
North $603,775,018
Total value of agricultural pro-
ducts South $560,682,765
Population of the United States
33,191,876, for 1850, will give
for average production by each
person $50 20
Population North, 13,527,220— >
each person ...$44 70
Population South, 9,664,756 —
each person $58 00
Now, if we deduct from all our ag-
ricultural products the amount
exported, to wit:  $118,750,118
We will have left for home con-
sumption $1,045,707,665
Which shows that each person consumed $45 08.
The North consumed $609,880,612; the South
consumed $435,827,053. Hence, it appears that
the North had a deficiency in 1850, of agricultural
products, to the value of $6,105,594; whereas, the
South had a surplus of $124,855,712; or each
person fit the North consumed thirty-eight cents
worth more than he produced; whereas, at the
South, each person produced $12 90 more, than
he consumed.
We will now examine the table of the products
of manufactures, mines, and mechanic arts.
On page 179, Census, we find the value of all
these products of the United States, deducting the
value of the raw material, to be $458,681,425.
The North produced $378,305,175
The South produced  80,376,250
$458,681,425
Let us deduct the manufactures ex-
poi ted in 1850, which amounted to 18,196,797
And we have left for domestic con-
sumption  $440,484,628
Being at the late of $19 to each person. Now,
the North consumed at that rate, $257,017,180,
and the South consumed $183,467,448.
Thus it appears that the South hadte purchase
from the North #103,091,198 of manufactures to
make up her deficiencies; which she paid for out
of her surplus of agricultural products, which
was §124,855,712, and then there was left to the
South a surplus of $21,764,514, for the year 1850.
I now propose to show that at the South we
cultivate more land to each person, and that the
cost of the land at the South is very little more
than half the cost of the land at the North, and
yet at the South, the produce is only nineteen
cents to the acre less, in value, than at the North.
(Page 169, Census.) Total, improved acres,
$113,032,614; in the southern States, $54,986,594;
in the northern StatesandTerntories,$54,046,020.
So that at the South there are 5.68 improved acres
to each inhabitant; and at the North, 4.29 each.
The total valuoof faims, $3,271,575,426; value
in southern States, $1,119,380,109; value in north-
ern States and Teiritories, $2,152,195,317. So
that at the South, the acre costs $20 37; but at
the North, $37 07.
Now, the agricultural products at the North
were, as we have seen, $603,775,018, being $10 39
to each acre, and at the South $10 20 to each
acre; and at the South, there are 5.68 acres to
each person; in the North, 4.29 acres to each per-
son. Ilenec, at the South, it is evident that each
person working land, costing $115 82, produces
$58; but in the North, each person working land
costing $159, produces but $44 70. Or, m other
woids, the agriculturist at the South can produce
