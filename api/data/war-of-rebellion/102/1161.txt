HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., August 3, 1865.

Colonel R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 31st ultimo, covering a telegram from the General-in-Chief to Major-General Sherman in relation to reduction of forces and expenditures in this department. The instructions contained in these communications I have ordered General Dodge, commanding on the plains, to execute without delay. I transmit inclosed copy of instructions to that officer for reducing everything to the minimum; also, a full statement of the condition of Indian affairs, and the difficulties which surround their settlement. * As You are aware, I have been but recently placed in command of this department, and have not yet had time to fully acquaint myself with its detail. The inclosed letter of instructions to Major-General Dodge will bring the military forces and expenditures to what seems to me the lowest possible limit for the present, in view of affording anything like adequate protection to the overland routes to the Pacific and to New Mexico, and the proper restraint upon the Mormons in Utah. I will leave nothing in my power undone to effect every possible reduction both of troops and expenses. I have the honor to request that copies of this letter and the inclosed communications be forwarded to the General-in-Chief.

I am, colonel, respectfully, Your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., August 3, 1865.

Bvt. Major General A. SULLY,

Commanding Northwest Indian Expedition:

GENERAL: I transmit inclosed a copy of a letter to Major-General Dodge for Your information. + The First U. S. Volunteers and all the cavalry at Your command whose terms of service expire this winter will be mustered out of service as soon as You return from your expedition. I have ordered General Dodge, as You will see from the inclosed letter to him, to send You 600 infantry to garrison the posts in Your command. You will also have the three companies of Seventh Iowa Cavalry and the battalion of Fourth U. S. Volunteers. I wish You to reduce both troops and expenditures to the lowest possible limit, contenting yourself with retaining force sufficient for defensive purposes. The Sixth Regiment of Iowa Cavalry to be sent for muster out to Davenport; the First U. S. Volunteers to this place. Report as soon as You return. Acknowledge receipt of this letter.

I am, general, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
