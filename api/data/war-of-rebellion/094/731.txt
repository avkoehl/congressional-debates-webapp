General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston:

General S. D. Lee reports from Florence he will be at Okolona in a few days; states he would be flag to have General Beauregard's views in regard to recent events in Tennessee. There are no advices whatever from that quarter, and do not understand General Lee's telegraph. Am apprehensive that some reverse may have occurred.
