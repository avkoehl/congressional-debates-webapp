It is reported that Rosser's brigade, Stuart's cavalry, 800 strong, struck the Orange line of railroad at Sangster's last night at 8 o'clock. they cut the wires and set fire to two bridges on Pope's Run. The general commanding directs that you notify your brigade at Warrenton to keep a good lookout toward Salem and New Market, as the enemy are reported to have gone in that direction toward the Blue Ridge, and if they come within reach your brigade at Warrenton, tell it to "pitch into" them and whip them, as their horses will be tired out. Have your whole command on the lookout, as they may try another point. Please answer when your receive this.

Very respectfully,
