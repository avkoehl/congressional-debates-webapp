Major General WILLIAM NELSON, Lexington, Ky.:

Adjutant-General Finnell, at Frankfort, telegraphs that Morgan is at Glasgow,and expresses apprehension that Frankfort may be attacked. I have authorized him to call upon you for a regiment, or more if required, in case Morgan advances that way. Please send the necessary force on call.

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 30, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Morgan is at Glasgow, with from 1,200 to 1,500 men and no artillery. What is to keep him from possession of Lebanon if all the forces are moved away? Colonel Bruce says one full regiment can protect the men at work on the tunnel.

One of my scouts reports rebel force at Sparta, Tenn., of considerable strength. They may come in force by that route and secure position in good foraging country.

You have statement of forces as far as ascertained. Morgan is still at Glasgow. News from above not good. Governor Morton promises more regiments to-morrow. Governor Yates sends none.
