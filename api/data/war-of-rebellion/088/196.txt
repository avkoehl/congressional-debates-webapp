Gary's brigade (cavalry) is also there. Refugees left Richmond Saturday evening, and say that infantry and cavalry went to Early Thursday and Friday nights last. This is certain, and I think the infantry was Willcox's division or a part of it, though one heard General Heth's name mentioned. The prisoners taken by the Tenth Corps (seven) are also from Field's division.
