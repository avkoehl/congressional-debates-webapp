Brigadier General CYRUS BUSSEY,

Commanding Third Division, Seventh Army Corps, Fort Smith, Ark.:

SIR: A scout of the enemy, some thirty-five in number (all mounted), swam Arkansas River at a point thirty-eight miles above. They also swam Wredigris; no ford at either place. Some infantry and every scout I could mount are after them. They travel in the night.

W. A. PHILLIPS,

Colonel, Commanding.
