the progress oí population m thesevennew ktates,duiing the
ten years which elapsed from 1820 to 1830 And I venture the
confi lent prediction that those which will be disclosed by the
census of 1840, will be found to be not less surpi ising
in view oí such results) can any one, the most aident friend
of the new States, (and I yield to none m fervent wishes lor
their prosperity) mi partially believe or justly contend that fresh
«stimulus is wanted to emigration! No one derives more plea
care than I do m witnessing the íapid growth and unexampled
prosperityof the new States They are gratifying triumphs of
our system, *>nd attest the wisdom of that plan for the admims
tiationof ihe public lands, undei the opeiation of which they
have been achieved and which is now sought to be essentially
dis tin bed The pi mcipal accession of population in the new
folates is den ved from the old States Their gam is om loss
Among the old States which contribute mostly by emigration to
the gmwih of he new ¡state*, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee
may be placed at the bead They have no just came to com
pía n and do not complain, at the loss of population which they
sustain But if undue stimulus and inordinate encouragement
were given to emigration by sacrificing or unnecessary reluc
log the price of the public lands, the old States would have just
cause to complain Such an unnecessary reduction would be
attended with a tuple injury to them of reducing the value of
lands with n their respective limits, of diminishing th*nr mte
re U i the public domain, the Common pioperty of the people
of the United States, and of offering a bounty to their citiyens to
remove from then limits, and to settle themselves m the new
btates Is thib right or reasonable? If it were necessary to the
well being of the new States, the sacrifico would be cheerfully
borne by the o id Hut it has been seen that their growth is quite
fast enough for their welfaieand happiness The new btates
aesuppli 1 i\iih population from all the States, bringing to
gethei thru customs laws prejudices, and habits TmiPisne
c ssary to huimo use these various elements, and to amalga-
mate ind consoiilate them 11 they were to populate faster
than they now do, the elements of discard would bediSbemina
ted and the peiiod of their becoming homogeneous would be
postponed
We have he«ud, upon this and upon other occasion , our sys-
tem of distributing the public lands reproached for iHiberahty,
and as deviating from tho practice of other nations    But is
t ¡ere any justice in this reproach)   Our system pioceeds upon
the principle that the public lands are tho propeiiy of the whole
people of the United estates., to be disposed of for the common
benefit, and not to be wasted on favorites and para&itet,     Ihe

fin the operation of natural causes, without stopping until the
demands ol our growing population shall ease the burdened
market, we are called upon to reduce the price of what it was
impossible fo have sold, on the mere presumption, contrary to
known facts, that it is not worth the extremely moderate puce
which the Governments demands And, if weentei on this ca
reer of reduction, on tha ialse piemises assumed, when and
wheie are we to pause? I have shown you that you cannot
stop with the 71 millions of acres on which the bill will quickly
opeiate, that you must advance to the 240 millions, not yet pre
pared foi the market, situated withm the existing States and
Territories, that you must finally apply the principle of reduc
tion to the 750 millions of acres which lie outside of their limits,
and that ultimately all this immense public domain must be
brought down to the low íate of fifty cents per acre, proposed m
the bill But this is not yet all Once establish this principle
of reduction, and who is to pi escribe, or to see, the limits of its
operation? Further and lui ther, and lower and lower, reduc
tions will be proposed Politics—party politics—will mix
themselves up m the question In some of the new States, can
didates for public office will pi esent themselves upon theground
of securing other i eductions in the price of the public lande,
and will appeal to the popular suffrage Other candidates will
come out espousing still lower rates It will become the lead
ing and controlling object until, m the end, the veiy purpose
which, in the eai ly stage of our progiesi, some gentlemen are
bold enough now to avow is accomplished, that is, that the com

sacrificed at nominal puces, or be appiopriated to a few, Ol be

SPEECH OF MR. LEGARE,
Of South Caroli*«a,
In the Hottse of Represp?itahve$, Monday, June 4, 1538—
On the bill making appiopuations foi pieventing and sup
pressing Indian hostilities
Mi  LEG \RE lose to say a few woj ds m reply to the gentle
man fiom Pennsylvania, [Mr Biddle ]   He  regretted that he
should be compelled todo so under all the disadvantages of a
surprise, for at that advanced stage of a very pit tiacted dis
cussion, he did not expect to see it takp, for the first time, the
turn which that gentleman had given to it    The House must
perceive, from toe nature ol the objections made to the policy
of the Admini"tntion in the conduct of the Florida wai, That
no answer lo them could le completely satisfactory, whioh did
not go very con^i 'oiablv into detail     Ihe gentleman hid pre
sented ^n i lgeiious and elabonte view of some lather minute
circumstances attending lhat wai     I he issues he had made up

o^e  which it was attempted to be drawn    It was so with íe

heionfesscd vtiy inadequately prepaied, by any special in
quiry into tin facts,to exphm whatever difficulties might pre
sent them«e ves on a supeinctal glance at them    But he felt
no d >ubt at all that, if called upon to do so   the Secretary of
Wai would he able to account satisfactory for whatever had
been thmi-h* ul jfctmnib'e in his plans or his conduct     He
had the uujioft tonfide ice in the charactei and abilities of that
gentleman    He did n >t allude to those hiph social qualities
which made him, by the confession of all n en, one otthe mo<t
aceomplished gentlemen ol whom the country had to boast, he
meant precisely those charac'enstics which the gentleman f-om
P nns\lvmiahad dei led him    Mr L spoke,he waspermad

when he declare 1 that he  thought him pre eminently distm

it ha ' bepn by wlntht   ia 1 seen and kn* w oi the condnct ni the

But tin cínfidence Mr T said wis confirn ed by what had

Mr   f. appe i   d with confidence lo the House, whefhei the
topics by which he had supported the charge of imbacihty and
mismanagement were such as ought to be made the ground of
so grave a censure What did they amount to? Some «rum
blmgs of General Te«up, eked out by the gentleman wihmoat
latí udinanan muendoee, some Indian poneys offered as ie
wauls to stimulate the enterpiise oi the bold and adventuious,
a difTeience of opinion as to a plan of operatu ne in a country
covti ed with swamp and forest, of which no survey had ever
been made,&c These, and a very few othei trifling objections,
were madetheioundationofan inference that the Senetaxy o{
War was destitute oí all admims rati ve talent, and that the wjjple
affairs oí his Department were in a state of uttet insuboidma
tion, imbecility and disorder
As to ihe atgumentum ad homtnem m lefeicnce to the In

s'inting evftiy branch of the public seivice, on nariew and sor

plying to himself He had never confounded parsimony with
economy He was not for hoarding cheese paungs and candle
ends True economy consists in laying out money to the gieat
est advantage and he was ready to furnish, nay, to lavish it, if
need were, foi any really important public eei vice—but, most
of ad, for the defence of the country m war
Wi*h regard to General Jesup s langmge, which bad been
treated as dlmost mutinous, Mr L said that, for any thu ghe
knew of the articles of war, it might beso, it might be a viola
tionof that severe discipline, even in a country where ecaicely
any other is observed, it might be that, in becoming a soidier,
that officer hid ceased to be a citizen Th's might ah he so,
though he must say it struck him as a little singular, amidst the
wild licentiousness of speech to which thisllou^e, m «pit of all
its boasted pnvPeges, had been compelled qaietlv toaccomuio
date itself He was not the champion of General Jes ip, he
wished not to be considered as defending the conduct o^ hat

disasters ofthe Florida war, he had toid the ttuth
[Mr Wise    How can that b^]
Sir, (said Mr Legare ) I repeat it I solemnly dec a, e, m the
face of the country, that upon the heads of this Congiess, of this
House, rests the hea'v y responsibil ty of having exposed the na
tion to the wasteful expenditure of its treasuies, to the loss of
life, the destruction oí property, and the desolation of the coun
try m Florida, by its absuid reduction of the army m 1821—a
reduction not only far below what would bo requisite to meet
any extraordinaiy emeigencies, notonI> below the exigencies
ot a state of war, but far below what was indispensable in such
a country for an adequate peace establishment The disasters
they were now deploring were only a fulfilment ofthe predic
