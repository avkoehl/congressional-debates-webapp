CITY POINT, August 19, 1864-10.15 a. m.

General HANCOCK:

The enemy claim to have captured 600 prisoners from you on tuesday and number at other times, making in al near 1,000. They also claim to have captured many horses. How far are these statements correct?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, August 19, 1864-10.30 a. m.

(Received 10.40 a. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

The enemy are moving troops to Petersburg. How many have gone I do not know, but probably a division. If you can find an opportunity to attack any weak point do not hesitate to do so. I think it will be perfectly sage for you to have any portion of your lines guarded merely with pickets, whilst all the balance of the force is being used as an assaulting column.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864-11 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Gregg reports that he does not know of any horses being captured in his late fight. He had 300 killed and wounded and a few mired in a swamp. He has 33 men missing, none of whom he believes to be wounded.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864-11.40 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have sent for the list of missing to ascertain the number supposed to have been taken prisoners. I have never heard of any horses being taken, nor have I hear of any prisoners being taken, except that I supposed stragglers might have been. There may have been some loss, but it was considered a matter of so small moment that it never was presented to me in the light of captures by the enemy. When General Miles and Gregg were pressed back on the Charles City road some men were missing, but it was supposed that they had been broken off in the jungle and had straggled to the rear. General Miles that evening reported 150 as unaccounted for, the most of whom he supposed he could collect.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
