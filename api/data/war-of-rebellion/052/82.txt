GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,

Numbers 136 Cincinnati, Ohio, August 19, 1863.

All ferries over the Ohio River and other streams within the limits of this department are hereby declared military highways, and when the interests of the service require it, will be subject to the control of the military authorities.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 20, 1863.

Major-General GRANT, Vicksburg, Miss.:

GENERAL: Immediately on the receipt of your recommendations for promotions, dated July 27, 1863, I approved and submitted them to the Secretary of War. All vacancies of major-general had been previously filled. I tried all I could to keep some open for your army, but failed. Only a part of those recommended for brigadier-generals could be appointed at present. My object in getting the appointments on colonel Rawlins' statement, without waiting for your official letter, was to prevent everything from being gobbled up before your army could get a chance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Hereafter no such shipments to private individuals will be permitted, except in cases of property purchased from sales by quartermasters and provost-marshals, for which proper vouchers will be given.

By order of Major General S. A. Hurlbut:

HENRY BINMORE,
