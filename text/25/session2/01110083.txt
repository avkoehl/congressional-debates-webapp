States were in " glass houses" m this case. Snp-
pose it Suppose it should turn out that 1,000 or
1,500 men, most of them Amencan citizens, had
located themselves on an island in a foreign
territory, furnished with arms and ammunition
from the State of New York, and aiding a rebel-
lion of the lawful subjects of a foreign pow-
er—suppose it should turn out that the steam-
boat Caroline had been employed in transport-
ing arms and men from our own frontier to the
island m question, and that at the time of
the outrage, it was employed for that purpose1
He imagined if thesff things should be proved,
gentlemen would not be quite so ready to expiess
themselves so warmly on the subject He (Mr B )
did not intend by that to justify the act so justly
complained of, the attack on the steamboat must
be looked upon by all as a most horrible and
violent sutrage, sufficient to make the blood of any
man tirgle to his finger ends , but still it was pos-
sible there might be some little apology for the
outbreak of passion of the Canadian troops, owing
to the treatment they have previously received
He therefore desired a proper investigation of the
subject, and he approved of the motion to refer it
to appropriate committees
Mr. RHETT deprecated any premature expies-
sion of opinion on the subject He thought the
House should, in the first place, look at the matter
calmly, and ascertain who was to blame One
gentleman had said that it was the fault of the Ad-
ministration, another gentleman had laid it all on
Great Britain, while olners had taken a different
view. Under these cucumstances, he considered
it highly mportant that it should be carefully in-
vestigated, and ascertained v here the blame really
lay Wasit with the Administration1 Candor, cer
tainly, would declare not, whilst not a regular sold er
was available at l's command, and the civ 1 officers
on me frontier, who h?d been called up n to reptess
the cxc t«ment, appear by their conduct to have
be n the instruments of increasing and continuing
it He w, Mr, asked Mr R had the difficulty com-
menced1 Was it not caused by a fugitive from
Canada, a traitor according to the laws of his
country, for whose head a price had been offered,
coming over the lines mto the United States,
and m open day, in the streets of Buffalo,
by his inflammatory speeches, inducing the citi-
zens of the United States to take up arms, and
assist m a rebellion of the subjects of a fuendly
power, who was rightfully endcavoimg to main-
tain her institutions1 This fugitive had not only
been harbored and entertained by us, but recruits
from amongst our citizens were openlj mustered to
his standard Now have we forgotten the laws of
nations as we applied them when Gen Jackson seized
upon Pensacola, because her autnorities harbored
our Indian enemv, and furnished tl em w ith muni-
tions of war1 He then ably demonstrated, by
the gentleman from Missachusetts, then Secretai}
of Slate, that for such a cause we had a right to
take possession bj the swoid of the city of a friendly
nation, and have the citizens of Buffalo done less
than the Governor o< Pensacola1 He commented
at some length on the law of nations, so far is rela-
ted to the pursu t of enemies over neutial ground,
and the practice of om own Government
m such eses He said it would be well
for gentlemen to lever a the matter, and to
suppose out selves m the Mtuation of the CdHad'"-
Suppose me subjects of Great Britain should
gather togethe- uoon oui frontiers, in comb na-
tion with some discontented, factious c tizens,
with the avowed puirose of overturning our
republican institutions—how would we bear it1
and how would we tolerate the idea that mu-
nitions of war, provisions, and fire arms, should
be furnished these our enemies by British sub
jpcts1 Unquestionably we would consider our
selves as gro-slv wronge 1,and would be very slow
in recognising an} spirit of friendship as dictating
such measures We would not look to individuals,
we would properly look to tne Government,
whose duty it was to control its citizens Ineffi-
ciency was no plea, foi then we ought to cease our
existence amongst the farm'y of nations As to
the steamboat affair, befoie he made up his opi-
mon as to any outrage committed by the British
soldiery, he must know all the fact's Shon1(1
it turn out that this steamboat was actually
in the possession of ftp hostile islanders, used
for canfina: ait cíes contraband of war, he
was not sure hat the act was not perfectly just -
liable according to the law s of na' o is At all
events, ,1 ii a ga'lanr onterpiiv, a d suca
as, he doubted no  every b ' 1 man on th s floor
would lute deemed himW morall} justilulp
in undertaking But we weie ignorant of all the
facts Si far, however, as they were known, the
citizens of the United ¡states were tne aggressors
throughout A.s the} woul 1 get all the glory, they
should also take a'l the responsibility, in defiance
of the laws of their countrj, of assailing a fuend-
ly nation
Mr R was not gung into a war ipon such
indefendible laudes Oí e war, With a debt
of 180 millions, was enough for one genera-
tion War was danger is t > the liberty of
any people, but especially so under oui frev
institutions, whose ver} ex sterce was based
upon a lealousy of poner Rccrtmul-ted n the
hands of Government In th s affair we had,
so far, nothing to be proua of We had been the
first aggressors, and should act thepait of anhono
lable aggressor, knowing that we were wrong
Mr R concluded by urging on the House to pur-
sue an hor-est policy, and to exhibit an upright,
honorable bearing on the subject, worthy of a free
and enlightened nation
Mr MENIFEE fully concurred n the opinion
that it was the duty of Congress to look at the mat-
tei calmly, and to pjrsue a liberal and statesman-
like course in relation to it but he cons dered it
extremeiy unwise foi gentlemen thus prematurely
to expiess themselves in a manner calcub'ed to
pioduce a hostile state of feeling netneen the peo-
ple of th s counti v and Great fii a It v ->s to be
presuma!, as i matter of cour t tna mis nam n
would undie?te its iigh.s, but a nu gentle-
men anticipate what we w m u do, befo e tne
stale of the case arises If any great pr ícipls
were involved, ruch as "tne light of search,"
or the " impressment ot Amencpn seamen,"
it w mid, he admitted, be a d fleient affair,
but as no such great piinciples were involved m
the present cas , m the absence of that, he was
extremely unwilling that we should be forced into
a state ot things when we should be influenced by
passion, contrary to the dictate of principle He
considered the expression of hostile fciings to-
ward Great Bntai i as absdutelj piepo ierous
Gentlemen seemed to forget tlmt betwiei us and
that country war was growing unfashionable an 1
that we were actuated and governed by a noblei
pnnciple that of the advancement ot hum m

Mr M endeavoied to show that <nea er caust
had been at woik, prev ions to me attacl on the
steamboat Cdiohne, to ptoduce the present stite of
things He alluded at some 'ength io the pel icy ot
this Government toward Mexico, which, he con-
tended, had engendered i lawless and dishonorable
leeling in our citizens, and had influenced their
conduct m relation to Canada He was nfa>or
of a referente of the whols subject to committee
Mr THOMPSON said he hoped that he had
giv en evidence, since h= had been a mem' er of this
body, lhat he was not disposed unnecessarily to in-
volve the country n war lie had, wl en he was
first up, deprecated a war With England II ne
had not expiessed himself on th s point as strong!}
as other gentlemen, it was only because h  could
' not He had said, and he repeated, t' at nothing
could be more disastrous to both countin  if not
fatal to the cause of human lu ltv IT c uld ne-
vertheless crnceive of a case in \ hie.n vc <• ulJ
not hesitate—a ense mvolvng t e hour, the
very existence of our Government Such, he
did not hesitate to sa}, - ou d be the case
if the facts stated in the affidavits wo now heard
read are true He knew nothing of the facts—he
would not pre-judge the case—he wouldnofrelv
upon newtaaper and ex parte statements on either
side, he wanted information in !>n aumente
form But if that statement is true, (and the Pre-
sident seems to think it so,) it is a cold blooded,
unmitigated, and savage murder of unoffending
Amencan citizens with circuns „ ees of atrocity
unprecedented among civil zed nations, even
m a state of actual war Pie sincerely
hoped ll a* there were fact? which would ex-
cuse or explain the statement which we now
h ivc If there are not, no tbs„i im°i on

der to our tribunals of the ferocious assassins,

Ihe gentleman fiom Kentucky (Mr. Menifee) had
said that there was no danger of war, that there
was no principle involved, none such as the right
ot search. No principle involved' Gread God'
«ir, are we to be told that the-'e is no prin-
ciple involved m the mvas on of our terr tory
by a hostile band of another nation, and the
murder, with fiendish atrocity, of our sleep-
ing and unoffending citizens1 The gentleman
Ins alluded to another topic, which, although
Mr F had anticipated, he did not expect from that
quailei The gentleman said, that the course of
our Gov eminent towarels Mexico had been infa-
mous, coivardlv, but that we were now about to
be forced by England, our peer, our equal, to do
that which our sense of justice had not prompted
tow arris Mexico Mr T confessed that he had
no wish to see our Government presented in this
light to the civ llized world It would be one of the
strangest changes in these times, when nothing is
certain but change, that he (Mr T ) should become
the apologist of fhi=, or of the last Administration
But he v as not disposed to assail improperly
even this Administration, and to embarrass or
weaken tt in its foreign intercourse and disputes
The fiist duty he held to be to sustain our Govern-
ment in its controversies with foreign powers to
the utmost extent of justice and right The se-
cón 1 to bieul down this dangerous and pernicious
Adminis ntion, which no man more than he de-
sues to see trampled down as it deserves to be.
Mr T had watched the course of the Administra-
tion through the whole progress of the wai in Tex-
as, and he wi^ prepared to prove that our Govern
ment ltd exerted every power under the Con-
stitution and laws to enforce neutralit}
The laws upon that subject are, in the mam,
penal, not preventive There was no power to
prevent our citizens from expatriating themselves
to Texas or any other country, nor to pievent them
from bearing arms in the w ars of their new coun-
trj Such w as almost, in e ven msianc e, the case
with our e iti7 ns who went to Texas Not one m
one hundred has gone there witn other view than
' f permanent «e tlement The only law which
could have prevented this was the act of 1818,
