MILITARY RAILROADS IN USE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND.

On the 1st of November, 1863, there were in use in the Department of the Cumberland 123 miles of military railroads, with 30 locomotives and 350 cars; 187 persons employed in the transportation depot, and 4,000 in the railroad service; average dispatched per day, 40 cars.

On the 14th of September, 1864, the number of miles of railroad in use was 956; locomotives, 165; cars, 1,500; persons employed in transportation department, 150; in railroads service, 10,805; dispatched per day, 150 cars.

The expenditures at Nashville by the Quartermaster's Department exclusive of the military railroad service, amounted for nearly $14,000,000.

It has not been as yet possible to carry all its provisions into full effect, but much progress has been made. It has improved the efficiency of the organization in the field materially; has encouraged officers, who see that good service meets with the reward of Honorable advancement, and has given general satisfaction. I do not doubt that it will, by its more thorough system of division of labor and responsibility in this office, by the means it provides for frequent and systematic inspections, and
