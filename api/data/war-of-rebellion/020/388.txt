GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Numbers 47. Hilton Had, Port Royal, S. C., November 1, 1862.

The Tenth Army Corps will learn with regard of the death of its commander, Major General O. M. Mitchell, who departed this life at 6.30 o'clock on the evening of the 30th October, 1862, at Beaufort, S. C.

Major General O. M. Mitchel was a graduate of the Military Academy, West Point, 1829, but retired from the Army after a short periods of service until the danger of his country again called him to arms. At the outbreak of the present rebellion and i the West, where he commanded a division of our Army as brigadier-general of volunteers, he proved himself to be a gallant and efficient commander.

Brief as was his career in the Department of the South, yet had he already won the esteem and regard of all by his energy and activity in directing the movements of the corps against the adjoining rebels and the frimeness and tempered justice with which he conducted the administrative duties of the department.

He died with the calm fortitude of a believing Christian, and while we lament the death of a gallant soldier and a kind friend, let us endeavor to emulate the virtues and soldierly qualities of our late commander.

As an appropriate tribute of respect to his memory, on the day following the receipt of this order, at every military post of this department, thirteen minute guns will be fired, commencing at meridian, and the flag of the Union to be displayed at half-mast from that hour to
