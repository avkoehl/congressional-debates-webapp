THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 10,
other great material interests of the country
to commerce, and yet that amounts to only
abcut one sixth of the annual productions of
the country.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. E. H. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, I
desire to call attention to the fact that the
difference between the two propositions now
before the committee is thirty cents a ton, and
that only. One proposition is to make the
I duty on pig iron six dollars, aud the other
proposition is to make that duty six dollars
and thirty cents a ton. It is about this differ-
ence that my colleague from New York, [Mr.
Cox,] thegentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Buuch-
AltD,] and the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr.
Kerr,] grow so eloquent.
Upon this text of thirty cents a ton, my col-
league from the city of New York, [Mr.
Cos,] protests against the proposiiion to give
"bounty" to manufacturers; and he makfis
the plea in the interest of commerce, aud in
the interest of commerce against manufactures
he assails Pennsylvania. Does he forget that
great as Pennsylvania is in manufactures, New
York is greater? New York is to-day the
greatest manufacturing State of this Union,
as it is greatest in agriculture and the greatest
in commerce. Our total imports last year
amounted to $518,759,518, and the manufac-
tures of tile State amounted to $790,000,000.
If "bounties" are paid, if this tariff is a
bounty, then bounties go more than to any
other State in the Union to the Empire State.
What are these "bounties" about which
gentlemen rail ? The gentleman from Illinois
[Mr. ISukohard] has juat cited the table given
by me early in this debate, and which shows
the dividends in favored New England m cot-
ton and woolen manufacturer for fifty years.
Upon those figures lie repeats his cry of
" bounties." Those figures plaeo the divi-
dends at, these rates :
Per cent.
From 1820 to 1830, :i, shiulo ovor  8i
From 1830 to 1810, just II)
From 1810 to 1>*50, hardly  83
From 1850 u> 18(10, ;t fraction over  f>i
From 1801) to 1870, not quite   12
If these ate "bounties," or are affected by
" bounties," what are the returns upon land
investments in all parts of the country ? They
are much greater than the earnings of capital
invested m inanufaetuies. fhose earnings are
less than the average interest, on mortgages on
real estate at, the West. 1 do not refer to
exceptional rates. The current, honorable
charge for money loaned on land at the West,
exceeds I he dividend of eastern manufacturers
alleged to be enriched by "bounties." The
rale of interest permitted bylaw is in Illinois,
which rny friend [Mr. BmtoUAUDJ represents,
ten per cent, per annum; in Indiana, which
my friend [Mr. Kionit] repiesents, ten per
cent. ; in Minnesota, which my friend [Mr.
DuNXlil,!,] represents, twelve per cent. ; and
in Nebraska, t welve percent. Now, the high-
est average profits reached by manufacturers
in prosperous New England in any decade for
hall'a century never exceeded twelve per cent,
per milium. Any "bounties" that are paid,
then, are paid not to the manufacturers of
New England and New York alone. They
are bounties, if they are bounties, which go to
the land-owners and farmers of the West.
They go to every man who has part and parcel
in the prospeiity of this great country.
But gentlemen protest against the high price
of iron. Are they going to put down tile
price of iron by statute? They cannot do it.
The law of supply and demand is stronger
than they. If they would try to keep down
the price of iron they must stop the building
of railroads. The annual increase in the num-
ber of miles of railroad in this country from
tilfl miles in 18(11, and 1,840 miles in 1860,
has run lip to 4,990 miles in 1869, to 6,145
miles in 1870, to about 7,000 miles in 1871,
and in 1872 it is estimated that it will be 8,000
miles, as this table shows. It is made up
from Poor's Manual of Railroads in the United
States:

Marvelous as is the extension of railroads,
the new uses for iron are even more wonderful.
Architecture leans upon it; mechanism re-
joices in it; comfort and luxury have made it
their ally ; costly structures are built of it, and
it is the furniture of rich and poor. The
blacksmith toils upon it, and it is a part of
ambition's works of art. You measure the
progress of civilization by the advance in the
demand for iron.
When gentlemen can stop this building of
railroads, ami all this demand for iron, they
will be able to keep down the price of iron.
They cannot do it, by assaults on our manu-
facturers. They can do it by building furnaces
and increasing production; not much by med-
dling with duties.
And yet, Mr. Chairman, we can concede
the proposed reduction of ten per cent, on pig
iron. We can afford it. Our home demand
for iron will sustain all our furnaces, and
many more to he built. This country is to be
the great iron producer of the world. Already
this duty has only become a revenue duty. It
is to-day not needed for protection. Iron is
independent. Let it continue to have a fair
field and it will always be so. All we want
is to develop our own ores, and learn to pro
duce from them better iron and more of it.
Mr. RANDALL. I move to amend the
amendment by strikingout " three and ahalt'"
and inserting in lieu thereof six and a half."
In my remarks the other day in showing
what I deemed to be the solid reasons which
should govern me in my treatment of this
question, and my vote upon it, I pictured the
prosperity of my native city by a statement
of facts in connection with her manufactures.
The gentleman from New York [llr. Cox,]
ill answer to that picture, which 1 thought a
proper one to present, has told this House that
the prosperity of which 1 spoke is the result
of robbery.
I ask the gentleman, for I know he is well
versed in history, to look for a moment at the
history of that, city. Like the New England
States, Philadelphia at one time possessed
much commerce; but circumstances have
stripped New England, as they did also Phil-
adelphia, of that commerce, in a very great
measure. Like a frugal and honest people,
following somewhat the example of New Eng-
land in that particular, when we saw com-
merce disappearing we directed our energies
and our labor to other pursuits. As weceased
to be a city of commerce we grew up as it were
into manhood a city of industry. And yet
the gentleman from New York—although
surely he must have spoken in a Pickwickian
sense when he said that—charged that indus-
trious people with being robbers. Sir, such a
charge against Pennsylvania and Philadelphia
of being robbers comes from a hard place.
But the slander carries with it an antidote in
the history, the very recent history of New
York city.
Moreover, the gentleman, seeking perhaps
to break the influence of my vote here, charged
that my position on this question was one of
the remnants of my Whiggery. Sir, I tell the
gentleman that I represent what was formerly
a large Whig constituency. And I say further,
that whenever he wants to strip his party of
the old Whigs of Philadelphia he will find
if he succeeds that it will be less than it is
now. Instead of its being any cause of regret
1 am proud of the education I received in
that school, because I am enabled to ingraft
upon legislation and thereby make conserva-
tive some of the radicalism which there is in
the only constitutional party now in existence
in this country.
Nor am I, sir, different from the Democratic
party of my own State in this particular. I
have here a resolution of the Democratic
Slate convention of last year, which came from
the committee on resolutions as their unan-
imous v.erdict, aud which was unanimously
indorsed by that convention. Gentlemen will
see by reference to it that We are not, in our
course upon this subject, different from the
judgment of the Democracy of that State.
The resolution I will read:
" That the present tariff is in many of its features
oppressive, and should be revised; and that wo
herewith request our Representatives in Congress,
when the tariff shall bo the subject of readjust-
ment, to see that the immense products of the State
and its industries are properly cared for,"
I am glad at ail times to see New York
prosperous. I never have cast an envious eye
toward her; it was never in my mouth to say
ill of her. She has pursued her course aud
we have pursued ours. But I say to the gen-
tleman that when he cites here the statistics
of Schuylkill county to show what Penn-
sylvania has obtained, it is but fair that he
should state that of that great interest ninety
per cent., so far as I am informed, should be
credited to labor. Therefore we are not pro-
tecting the monopolists who own the land at
all, but we are doing everything to increase
the wages of labor so as to make people hap-
pier and more prosperous.
I also might qualify my former statement a
little further in this respect: I think the census
will show the fact that in the city of Philadel-
phia there are but about six or seven persons
to each house, while in the city of New York I
fear that it will run as high as twelve or' four-
teen to each house. Sir, in Philadelphia every
honest mechanic, every industrious man can
have a home of his own. He can buy land
and pay for it gradually ; he can build his house
upon it, aud have something left for his chil-
dren. For one I am not ready to strike down
or impair in any degree that prosperity which
gives to industry and honesty a habitation,
with also the means to support and bring up a
family in comfort.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I rise for
the purpose of making a word of reply to my
colleague from the State of Missouri [Mr.
Boiideit] in reference to his statements in
regard to the wonderful increase of wealth
of the State which he and I in part repre
sent. Like my colleague, I am proud of the
past achievements of the people of the State
of Missouri; and I am proud of her future
greatness as a State and as a mighty Com-
monwealth of this Republic.
But if this House supposes that the figures
read by the gentleman represent, all the peo-
ple of the State of Missouri have accumulated
by their own industry and energy within the
last twenty years, they will be greatly mis-
taken ; they will be greatly misled by those
statements. First, the returns of the census
for 1850 and 1860 of the property of fhe State
of Missouri were upon a gold basis. The last
computation for 1870 was made upon a cur-
rency basis. That will account for a consider-
able difference. In addition to that the same
quality of real estate in the State of Missouri
