old as the war, and orders for it have been issued from here to turn whenever out army had a prospect of going into Missouri; but it ought to be done with a larger force than Stand Watie can start. His might do for a flanking party out west, but the whole Indian Division ought to move up Grand River and Neosho while General Price goes into Missouri; each column would support and create a diversion in favor of the order. General Maxey has probably forgotten, but I gave him the outline of such a movement in conversation soon after he assumed command of the district.

HEADQUARTERS C. S. FORCES, INDIAN TERRITORY,In the Field, September 24, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the expedition from this command, under Generals Watie and Gano, north of Arkansas River is on its return, having destroyed several Federal camps and a large quantity of hay between Gibson and Cabin Creek on the Texas and Missouri road, and captured a train of between 100 and 200 wagons, I know to be reliable, who arrived yesterday to headquarters of First Creek Regiment, bringing arms, &amp;c., captured by himself from a Federal officer. Generals Watie and Gano are returning slowly, the command being much worn and tired. I moved up this morning with Walker's brigade and Duff's command to old Camp Pike, on Canadian, and also send parties toward Conchanty to meet the train in case it should return by the route west of this.

Respectfully,

D. H. COOPER,

Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Captain T. M. SCOTT,

Assistant Adjutant- General.

N. B. - Official report will be forwarded as soon as received.
