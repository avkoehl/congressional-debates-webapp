APPENDIX' TO THE CONGRESSIONAL ©Ml.
38th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Ho. 01? Reps.
the Treasury can be thus kept in a condition to
meet current demands, it is not difficult to restrain
the circulation of Government paper within safe
limits. But this, not always certain in a time of
peace, though with abundant resources it always
should be, is often impossible when war upon
a large scale, and long continued, has created
distrust. Hence it has followed that, under the
acts referred to, our bonds have assumed vari-
ous forms, to suit what was supposed to be the
choice of lenders. Our notes have shown a simi-
lar diversity of character, while it has been found
impossible to avoid the necessity of using them to
an extent which could not but aggravate the trou-
bles incident to the necessities of our condition.
Yet, though forced to resort to the issue of pa-
per for the time, the idea of a specie basis was not
lost sight of, as the payment of interest on long
loans in coin was amply secured. And though in
several of the acts authorizing the issue of b&nds
at long periods payment of the principal at matur-
ity in coin is not specifically provided, the omis-
sion, it is believed, was accidental, as there could
have been no intention to make a distinction be-
tween the different classes of securities in this re-
gard. It is respectfully recommended to remove'
all doubt upon this point by proper legislation.
Although the wisdom of thus securing the pay-
ment of interest on bonds in coin has been ques-
tioned, and the pledge of the receipts from cus-
toms, to be collected in coin for that purpose, has
perhaps facilitated the operations of those dis-
posed to enhance the price of gold for speculative
purposes, the Secretary is of the opinion that these
measures were not only wise but necessary at the
time, and greatly aided in sustaining public credit.
The expenditures for the preceding fiscal year
so slightly exceeded the estimates of the Depart-
ment, that at the last session of Congress it was
not considered necessary to increase the amount
authorized to be borrowed by existing laws. Ex-
perience had shown, however, that some changes
of form were advisable. By an act approved
March 3, 1864, authority was given to the Secre-
tary to issue bonds to the amount of $200,000,000
in lieu of so much of the loan authorized by act
of March 3, 1863, redeemable after any period
not less than five years, and payable not more
than forty years from date. At a subsequent
period of the session, June 30,1864, the author-
ity conferred by the first section of the act of
March 3, 1863, was repealed, except so far as it
affected an amount of $75,000,000 then advertised,
and power was given to borrow $400,000,000 on
bonds redeemable after five years, and payable not
more than forty years from date. By the second
section of the same act authority was conferred
to issue, in lieu of the same amount of bonds,
$200,000,000 in Treasury notes, which might be
made a legal tender at their face value, bearing
interest at a rate not exceeding seven and three
tenths per cent., payable in lawful money, and
convertible, at the pleasure of the Secretary, into
bonds issued under theauthority of said act. The
Secretary was furtherempowered to substitute for
Treasury notes issued under former acts an equal
amount of notes such as were therein authorized.
A table is appended to this report, showing the
amounts issued under the several acts hereinbe-
fore referred to, to the beginning of the present
fiscal year, from which it appears that, by the
laws in force on that day, the Secretary had au-
thority to borrow, on the credit of the United
States, the amounts following, namely:
1. Under the act of March 3, 1863, so much of $75,000,000
advertised previously to June 3d, 1864, as had not been
awaided to bidders  {§32,159,700 00
2. Undei the act of March 3,1861, so much
as had not been subscribed lor, and paid
into the Treasury, namely     127.003.520 00
3. Under the net of June 30, 1864   400,000,000 00
4. Amount of Treasurynotesissued under

The public debt, as stated by my predece^or m ins repoit
of December 10, 1863, was $1,U9S,793,161 37
of December 10, 386a, was ^x,uue,/w,iDi 37
To this should be added amount paid into
the Treasury previous to July 1,1863, for
which evidences of debt were subse-
quently issued  23,782,423 20
The Secretary is of the opinion that not over'
$25,000,000 can be safely calculated upon as
likely to accrue from similar sources during the
current year.
The item of "premium on gold shipped from
San Francisco to London," may also require
further explanation. In March, 1863, it became
necessary to transmit a considerable amount of
funds to London, for a special purpose, for which
an appropriation had been made by Congress,
and it was thought advisable to deposit a certain
amount of our securities with an eminent London
banker, against which bills might be drawn.
Five-twenty bonds to the amount of $10,000,000
were accordingly placed in the hands of two dis-
tinguished citizens, to whose care the negotiation
was committed. The negotiation failed, and
$6,000,000 of the $10,000,000 wsr& returned to
the Treasury and disposed of. It was thought
advisable that the amount of $4,000,000 should re-
main, and tliatexchange should be diawn against
it, and the bonds disposed of abroad, if a favorable
market should be found. It appears, however,
that very nearly this amount of issue is in excess
of the $511,000,000 authorized by existing laws,
$510,750,900 having been disposed of. The act of
June 30,1864, authorizes the Secretary to dispose
of " any bonds known as five-twenties remaining
unsold." It is at least questionable whether by
this clause power is conferred to dispose of an
amount beyond thatfixed by existing laws. Ad-
ditional legislation may remove that doubt, should
Congress think it advisable, otherwise they may
be canceled.
Exchange having been drawn, itbccame neces-
sary to provide funds to meet the bills at maturity,
which was accomplished by shipments of gold
from California.
The expenditures for the current fiscal year
were estimated in the last report of the Secretary
as follows:
Intimated balance of former appropna-
— ,000,000 00

cellaneous sources require explanation. Ihey

And the receipts from ordinary sources
were estimated m the aggregate at  206,836,539 93
Leaving to be provided by loans    $544,978.549 93
This estimate, like all others of a similar char-
acter, was necessarily based on past experience
with regard to unexpended balances, and upon
estimates from the different Departments, which,
in a time of war, must be liable to great uncer-
tainty. Additional information enables me to
state the probable expenditures with a nearer ap-
proach to accuracy. As corrected by including
ko much of the actual balance of former appro-
priations as is liable to be used during the year,
those made at the last session of Congress, the
additional amounts called for to meet probable
deficiencies, and reducing the balance of unex-
pended appropriation at the end of the year, as
from amounts expended during the first quarter
would seem necessary, the estimate is as follows:

The amount of certificates outstanding on the
1st of November, 186-1, was $233,593,000. Tins
being a much larger amount than the market ought
to bear, it would not be wise to calculate upon
these securities as available for the service of the
