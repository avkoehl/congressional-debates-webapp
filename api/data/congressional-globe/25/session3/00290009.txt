president's message.
Mr. CAMBRELENG, from the joint commit-
tee on the pait of the House appointed to waiton
the President of the United States, reported that 1
they had discharged that duty, and the President I
had infoi med them, in reply, that he wo ild tians- |
mit to the two Houistsa mi &&a^t to-day
The  President's   annual   Mi   sage   was   then j
biought in  by his private seen taiy, and, being 1
laid befoie the House by the Speaker, was lead
at length by the Clerk.
Mr. HAYNES moved that the message and
accompanying documents he lefened to a Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
and that fifteen thousand copies without the doc-
uments, and five thousand v  ■ th the documents,
be printed for the use of the House.
Mr. BELL did not raise any pai m ular ob]ec-
tion to the printing, though he would piefei a less
number, because the message would be fur more
widely disseminated through the newspapers than j
by the members, but he objected to the other '
blanch of the motion at this time He tequested
the Clerk to read the entiy on the Journal of last
session, winch was done.
Mr. B. added that he believed that message
was never taken up in Committee ot the Whole
on the state of the Union, but discussed at the
present slage, and such was his objict in lcfer-
ence to the piesent message, lie u< sued to ex-
press his sentiments upon a numbci of the topics
embi aced nut as early as possible; but unless occa
sion was taktn to do so on the motion to commit,
they could hope foi no other oppoitumty. He
hoped, therefore, the quest on would be taken on
the punting, and the othei motion laid over.
Mr. HAYNES said the gentleman was en-
tirely mistaken in the supposition that the last
annual mess-tge was never consideied in Commit-
tee of the Whole. It was discussed again and
again m that committee, and a number of gentle-
men had addressed the House upon it.
Ml. BELL might be •iii&taken as to that point;
but no disposition was made of the message.
Mr. HAYNE3 statid what was the fa-t, that
all the message had been disi osed of except that
part in i elation to the finareis But what was
(he great object of sending it to the Committi e of
ho Whole on tin state of the Union ' hwas that
'the widest scope of debate should be given.
Mr. H. then varied his motion to the terms of
that on the Jumna!, viz: to prmffitteen thousand
copies of the message and accompanying docu-
ments, and five thousand copits without, the lat-
ter to lie fuimsned within two days.
After some Anther conveisation between
¡VIessis. Wise, ÍAsiti Gai «i>, and Haives,
the motion was airreed to without a division.
The SPEAKER laid before the House the an-
nual repoit of the Secretary of the Tieasury on
th< state of the finances; which,
On motion of Mr. CAMBRELENG, was laid
on the table; and, at the suggestion of several
members, ten thousand extra copies ordered to be
printed.
Also, a communication from the Secretary of
State covering a statement of the expenditures
out of the contingent fund of that Department for
the past year; which,
On motion of Mr. HOWARD, was laid on the
table.
WIDOW OF W. S. FRANKLIN.
Mr. LOGAN, on leave, submitted the follow-
ing resolution:
Resolved, That the widow of Walter S Fravkus, de-
ceased, late Clerk of the House of Representatives ot the
United States, he allowed and paid, out of the contingent
fund, his salaiy as Clerk afoiesaid, up to the 3d December,
1838
Mr. UNDERWOOD called for the yeas and
nays; which were ordered
Mr. McKENNAN suggested to his colleague
to cause the resolution to read up to the " 3d of
December," when the new Clerk took upon him-
self the duties.
Mr. LCX3AN so modified it
Mr. WISE asked when Mr. Franklin died?
The CHAIR replied, from the information
contained ¡a Mi. Buich's letter of yesterday, on
the 20th ofSeptembei.
Mr. WISE moved to make it that day; for
though no one lamented Mr. Franklin's death
moie than he did, he could not vote a mere gia-
tuity without service
Mr UNDERWOOD reminded Mr. W. that
up to the time of Mr, Franklin's decease his
salary belonged to his executors
Mr. WISE thereupon withdrew his amend-
ment.
The resolution was waimly sustained by Mr.
McKENNAN and Mr. GL VSCOCK, when it
was agieed to—yeas 93, navs G3.
On motion, the House adjoined.
