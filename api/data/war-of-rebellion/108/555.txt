Colonel WALTON,

Washington Artillery:

If you have a light battery that you think will be efficient on the banks of the river, I wish you to send it on the left bank either at Chaffin's Bluff or opposite the obstructions at Warwick Bar to retard the ascent of the enemy's gun-boats said to have arrived at City Point. The battery must select concealed positions, not near residences, and endeavor to cripple and destroy the wooden boats and drive from deck the men on the iron boats.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE.
