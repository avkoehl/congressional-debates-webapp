HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, January 1, 1863.

Lieut. Gen. E. KIRBY SMITH, Knoxville:

GENERAL: Your telegram of the 29th was received about 10 o'clock the next morning. One from Brigadier-General Marshall was received at the same time. I immediately ordered all my available troops, Brigadier-General Marshall commanding, to Bristol, and communicated the information to Brigadier-General Floyd. Marshall reports that he is in pursuit of the enemy. Floyd is also moving against them, and if they attempt to escape into Kentucky by way of Pound Gap, I have strong hope that they will be overtaken and severely punished. I regret exceedingly that I did not receive earlier information of this movement of the enemy, and of your inability to meet them with a sufficient force. I was under the impression that one of your general officers was commanding at Cumberland Gap, and I supposed with a sufficient force either to have prevented the passage of so large a body of cavalry so near the gap or to have given information of their approach. On the 19th instant I addressed a letter to Brigadier-General Heth, commanding Department of East Tennessee, suggesting that it was desirable I should have the earliest information of any movement of the enemy in that direction, and asking that he would keep me advised on that point but have not heard from him in reply. I shall send, by the train to-day, to Bristol, Captain Robinson, of the engineers, on my staff, to examine and report the extent of the damage done the railroad in East Tennessee, and to make an estimate of the time and cost of repairs. I am sure you
