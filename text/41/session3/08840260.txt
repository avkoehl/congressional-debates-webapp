They show, in this connection, the total num-

United States, but they have no relation to the
question under discussion, which may be con-
sidered as practically limited to those within
the lerritories.

It thus appears that the Indian reservations
cover one acre out of every five and fourtonths
acres in ihe whole public domain not included
in States, which gives to them an assignment
of 72!)J acres per capita. Deducting from the
total population the 70,309 estimated by the
department to be already within the boundaries
of Oklamaha, and the whole of its territory,
namely, 41.091 180 acres, there is left a total
Indian population in all the Territories exclu-
sive of Oklahoma of only 95,919, who occupy
reserves to the extent of 79,583 813 acres, or
829 acres per capita of choice land in the direct
path of settlement. This is our problem.
It will be observed that I have excluded the
States from this calculation, because where
Indians, with or without their consent, are in-
closed within the limitsof a State, they accept,
ex necessitate, the conditions and restraints
of civilization, and the adoption of its habits
and customs and obedience to law follow as an
inevitable necessity.
It is upon the border line where civilization
meets savageism in its death-struggle that the
Indians are at once formidable, vindictive,
a n javaS*' when tho wave of population has
rolled over them it leaves them as tribes
stranded and broken, submissive and sub-
dued.
With very inconsiderable exceptions, if any,
and I am not aware of any, every acre of all
these Indian reserves, amounting, as before
shown, to 137,846,971 acres, are, by distinct
prohibition by law, excluded from white set-
tlement; and all but 13,896,763 acres are held
by the several tribes under treaties with the
United States, by which the Government is
bound, in express terms, to guaranty and de-
fend the Indian possession against the intru-
sion of white settlers.
The Indian intercourse acts which, from the
first, in 1785, through all their changes arid
supplements, down to the act of June 30,1834,
which consolidated all previous acts, and is
still in force with its last supplement in 1860,
exclude, under heavy penalties, all white cit-
izens, all of every race or citizenship, from
acquiring or seeking to acquire any rights
whatever of property in the soil.
The eleventh section of the act provides:
"That if any person shall make a settlement on
any lands belonging, secured, or granted by treaty
with the United States to any Indian tribe, or shall
survey, or shall attempt to survey, such lands, or
designate any of the boundaries, by marking trees or
otherwise, such offender shall forfeit and pay the
sum ot $1,000; and it shall moreover be lawful for
the President of tho United States to take such
measures and employ such military force as he may
judge necessary to remove from the lands as afore-
said any such person as aforesaid.
Sec. 12. And be it further enacted, That no pur-
chase, grant, lease, or other conveyance ot lands, or
oi any titlo or claim thereto, from any Indian nation
ortnbooi Indians, shall be of any validity in law
or equity, unless tho same be made by treaty or con-
vention entered into pursuant to the Cons itution ;
any person not employed under the authority
ot the United States shall attempt to negotiate such
treaty or convention, directly or indirectly, to treat
with any such nation or tribe of Indians for tho titlo
or purchase of any lands by them held or claimed,
such person shall forfeit and pay $1,000."
Ihe seventh section of the same act provides—
."That if any person other than an Indian shall,
within the Indian country, purchase or receive of
any Indian, m the way of barter, trade, or pledge, a
Sun, tr:i]>, or other article commonly used in hunt-
ing;, any instrument ot husbandry, or cooking uten-
sils ot the kind commonly obtained by the Indians
m their intercourse with the white people, or any
articl o of clothing except skins or furs, ho shall for-
ieit and pay tho sum of fifty dollars."
By the twentieth section of the same act,
amended by the act of February 13, 1862, it
is made an offense, punishable with fine and
imprisonment, to "sell, exchange,give, barter,
or dispose of any spirituous liquor or wine to
any Indian under the charge of any Indian
superintendent or Indian agent appointed by
the United States," orto introduce, orattempt
to introduce, liquors or wines into the Indian
country.
These laws are enforced with all practicable
fidelity and vigor, but illicit trade and inter-
course have become year by year more diffi-
cult of control; and the demoralization which
attends it is the most fruitful source of border
outrage, and not unfrequently has resulted in
mutual retaliation and war.
Genera^ li. 13. Marcy, Inspector General
of the United States Army, in his report of
June, 1809, says:
" The practice which has existed for many years
of licensing white traders, who for the most part
are of the most dissolute and unscrupulous order of
humanity, is unwise in the extreme, for the reason
that they exercise a most pernicious and controlling
influence over the savages. They sell them whisky
debauch their women, lurnish hostile tribes with
arms and ammunitions, and all their energies nrp
exerted to perpetuate their traffic, which would be so
wi'fil m as.'0 become unprofitable if the Indians
had fixed habitations and cultivated the soil."
As early as 1702 D'iberville wrote to the
authorities in Paris:
fniiif,? ?rSP°hmen (traders) should be allowed to
follow Indians on their hunts, as it tends to keep
them hunters, and when they are in the woods thev
do not desire to become til lers of the soil."
All experience, from the earliest attempts
to civilize the Indians, confirms these views
and justifies the policy of keeping them dis-
tinct and separate from the whites who sur-
round them. Yet it is plain that this policy
cannot be continued. That portion of the In-
dian reserves, exclusive of Oklahoma, which,
uuder the operation of this bill, may be ulti-
mately opened to settlement, discharged from
all Indian title, embraces a territory exceeding
one and a quarter miles square fur every man,
woman, and child of all the tribes, and abound-
ing in all the resources of wealth, and inviting
population by their minerals, their climate,
and their soil. It is hopeless and unreasonable
to expect that civilization and its attendant
developments must stop on the borders of a
barrier so frail and so opposed to the progress
of the age and the necessities of the times. It
is a foregone conclusion that, with or without
right, these Indian lands must become the
abode of civilization.
But in addition to the lands specifically set
apart for particular tribes by law or by treaty
there is a vast territory, whose boundaries it is
almost impossible to define, covering many mil-
lions of acres, which are the hunting-grounds of
nomadic tribes, wild, untamed savages, without
local habitation, trained to savage warfare, sen-
sitive to real or imagined wrongs, quick m re-
sentment, and cruel in revenge. Over all these
lands, wholly indifferent to the rights of the
Indians, some attracted by the discoveries of
gold and silver, some by the allurements of
climate and soil) some by the restless spirit
of adventure, there is gradually spreading a
pioneer population, energetic, unscrupulous,
often revengeful and cruel, acknowledging no
restraint but power, who seize with violence
and hold with force whatever possession at-
tracts their desires. The United States in
some instances have interposed to eject the
intruders; but the pressure of westward settle-
ment; the feverish speculation engendered by
the discovery of gold and silver and valuable
minerals; the building of the Pacific and other
railroads, intersecting, dividing, and subdivid-
ing the country ; ihe numerous radiating cen-
ters of population which are located around
them, have rendered this mode of dealing with
the question wholly impracticable. A large
portion of these lands, and in some instances
the whole ot some reservations, should be
released both from Indian title and possession
and thrown open to preemption, settlement,
and sale.
For the Government to seize them, or any
part of them, as a mere act of sovereign power,
would be a violation of the plighted faith of
the nation, alike in conflict with its dignity
and the guarantied rights of the tribes, and
would inevitably lead to war.
The end to be attained, and of which this
bill is the initial and essential means, is the
ultimate consolidation of the tribes, and their
removal, with their voluntary consent, from
the reservations they hold to an assigned por-
tion of the Territory of Oklahoma. The right
thus to locate them therein the United States
has already acquired by retrocession under the
several treaties of 186(5, from the tribes whose
reservations under previous treaties covered
all the Territory.
That the Territory proposed is large enough
for the purpose is abundantly clear. Upon the
supposition that every Indian, man, woman,
and child _west of the Mississippi would locate
within it, it would afford one hundred and fifty
acres per capita. But there are many tribes
within the States whom it is not desirable to
remove; and some far removed from the lines
of settlement whom it may not be necessary to
remove. Upon the most liberal estimate of the
number who would probably be there removed
there would be an average, under every reason-
able probablity, of not less than three hundred
acres per capita. Making every allowance for
waste and unproductive land there is no reason
to doubt that there is abundance to afford ulti-
mate title in severalty to one hundred and sixty
