THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 9,
officers throughout the country, in the hands of
a subordinate official; for the gentleman will
observe that the Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue, so faras regards the conduct of this office,
is, where the law does not expressly provide
otherwise, a subordinate of the Secretary-of
the Treasury. I prefer, as I have already re-
marked, that this appointing power should be
distributed, and not, as the geatlemw from
Ohio proposes, accumulated in the hawds of
one man. Hence I oppose the amendment.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I desire, with the per-
mission of the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. randall,-] to ask him a question, which
[ hope may somewhat elucidate this subject.
I quite agree with the idea- expressed by the
gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Schenck] that the
responsibility should rest where the power is;
and I was very glad to learn that the gentleman
has reformed his views on that subject. I de-
sire, however, to inquire of my friend from
Pennsylvania whether he does not think the
opinions he expresses are somewhat in conflict
with the early practice of the Government in
regard to this matter?
Mr. RANDALL. To what practice does
the gentleman allude ?
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I will explain in a mo-
ment. Does not the gentleman think it better
that the power to control these appointments
should be lodged in the hands of the President,
he being held responsible for the proper exer-
cise of that power in the same way as the
gentleman from Ohio proposes to throw the
responsibility upon the Commissioner of Inter-
nal Revenue, in whom he would vest the power
of appointment and removal ? Does not the
gentleman think that the later practice of the
Government has tended to diminish the effi-
ciencyof the revenue service and deprived the
Government of income which it would other-
wise have obtained by taking the power from
the President, and yet holding him responsible
for what he cannot control?1 Of course my
friend understands that I am referring to the
tenurc-of-ollice act, which gives the Senate the
control of appointments, though the President
is still held responsible. 1 am glad to hear
the gentleman from Ohio express views which
are more in accord with the earlier practice of
the Government, and, as I think, more states-
manlike than those he has heretofore main-
tained.
Mr. RANDALL. In reply to my friend
from Wisconsin [Mr. Eldridge] I will only
say that I am in no wise responsible for the
passage of the tenure-of-office act. I voted
against its passage; and had I been here I
should have voted in favor of its repeal. But
it is manifest from what we know of the report
of the Committee on Retrenchment that the
tenure-of-offiee act will not, as to its essential
features, be repealed. I am, therefore, look-
ing at things as I find them.
Mr. SCHENCK. Does the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Randall] intend to de-
mand a division when this amendment shall be
voted on ?
Mr. RANDALL. Yes, sir.
Mr. SCHENCK. Then I move that the
committee rise, with a view to an adjournment.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose ; and Mr. Wilson,
of Iowa, having taken the chair as Speaker
pro tempore, Mr. Delano reported that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had, according to order, had under con-
sideration the bill (H. R. No. 1060) to reduce
into one act and to amend the laws relating to
internal taxes, and had come to no conclusion
thereon.
And then, on motion of Mr. SCHENCK,
(at nine o'clock and fiye minutes p. m.,) the
House adjourned.

IN SENATE.
Tuesday, February 9, 1869.
The Secretary began to read the Journal of
yesterday.
Mr. STEWART. I move that the reeling

have the morning hour for morning business.
Business has been accumulating for several
days, and we ought to dispose of it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The read-
ing of the J ournal will be dispensed with, unless
objection be made.
Mr. RAMSEY. I have no objection to that,
but I object to the motion of the Senator from
Nevada, to proceed at once with the constitu-
tional amendment.
Mr. STEWART. I move to proceed to the
consideration of the constitutional amendment.
Mr. SHERMAN. I simply want to intro-
duce a joint resolution, and then I have no
objection to taking it up.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will receive the usual morning business.
