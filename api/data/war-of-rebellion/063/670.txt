could reach it, and hold it, if possible, to prevent the enemy from crossing the river. About 150 men who escaped from Dardanelle I instructed Colonel Moore to collect together and station at Galley Rock, to check the enemy if they attempt to cross there. I will leave at 11 o'clock with Captain Snelling's force for Norristown, and will get telegraph through if possible. From scouts I sent to Shelby's camp I learn that shelby detailed 4 men to hading around Perryville, and 4 to carry dispatches to Cooper. From what they could gather it was Shelby's intention to cross the river and operate on Devall's Bluff and railroad. The train from here I have ordered to camp on the south side of the river for the present. Did the flat arrive safe?

Generals STEELE and CARR:

Shelby's forces have left Dardanelle; 3,000 crossed to north side of river and gone toward Clarksville and Roseville. I think Shelby will cross river again and try and effect a junction with McRae. The latter, rumor reports, coming this way; if such is the case, will send all dismounted men to Little Rock with train, and with mounted men try and prevent Shelby from crossing, falling back on Fort Smith if necessary.

Brigadier-General CARR:

GENERAL: Colonel fuller reports the rebels all on this side of river with artillery, moving northeast direction. The unmounted men are 5 miles from here. I will move them forward with train immediately. I will call in the force above and leave here in the morning for Little Rock unless otherwise ordered.

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

[General E. A. CARR:]

GENERAL: I halted the train on the Cadron to bring the wagons with telegraph apparatus back, and the mounted men with train to send on scout. There are still 150 men of the Dardanelle command not come in yet. I will try and send them with train in the morning. Many are unable to walk to Little Rock, and will have to take turns riding in the wagons. I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Fuller with the troops to Norristown. I remained to send scout to Springfield. Do you wish the train sent in without delay?

Respectfully,

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
