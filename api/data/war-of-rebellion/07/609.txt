Send all troops to arrive to Fort Henry. They can be transferred here, if required, and there is now appearance that point is in danger. One gunboat should be there.

Brigadier-General CULLUM, Cairo:

General W. T. Sherman is assigned to the command at Paducah. One regiment and battery leave here to-day and two more will follow immediately. They will touch at Cairo and Paducah. Stop them, if you fear an attack and want them.

Brigadier-General BUELL, Louisville:

The attack be made on Fort Donelson to-day by the joint land and naval forces, or if not to-day certainly to-morrow. Would it not be possible to make a cavalry demonstration on Bowling Green? A mere feint might help. I have no maps other than the general ones in book-stores. Why not come down and take the immediate command of the Cumberland column yourself? If so, I will transfer Sherman and Grant to the Tennessee column.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

FEBRUARY 13, 1862.

Colonel BRUCE,

Commanding Brigade, Bardstown:

March for Louisville with all the effective men of your brigade to-morrow morning. You must reach here early on Sunday without fail.
