fire of the first musketry the enemy were in possession of our pits. From two officers and a number of men who escaped from the rifle-pits, I ascertained that the enemy's attacking party were at least 1,500 men, while our picket consisted of 86 men from the Sixty-first North Carolina Troops, under command of First Lieutenant William Ramsey, who was among those who made their escape.

Our pickets were so soon overwhelmed that I can say but little of their resistance, but think they did their duty well.

Owing to strength of enemy, I refrained from attacking him with infantry, but am keeping up an artillery fire on him both from here and Gregg.

Casualties during the day, 4 killed, 26 wounded, and 79 missing. The report of the surgeon in inclosed herewith.*

I remain, sir, very respectfully,

GEO. P. HARRISON, Jr.,

Colonel, Commanding.

During last night I kept up a fire from one 8-inch sea-coast howitzer and two 12-pounder brass howitzers at irregular intervals upon the working parties of the enemy.

At early dawn I discovered that they had advanced their line to within about 350 yards of the fort. During the greater part of the day I have fired upon their advance from one 8-inch sea-coast howitzer, but an accurate and concentrated fire form their Parrott guns rendered the chambers almost untenable, and I was compelled to cease.

Since morning they have advanced about 50 yards nearer by means of their sappers, and at dark this evening a sharp fire of musketry from the epaulements ran in their working parties. I opened at
