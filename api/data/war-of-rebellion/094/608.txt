Madison Station, an officer and 30 men; Beaver Dam, one company of 50 men; Limestone, a company of 50 men; Piney, a company of 50 men; Decatur, 1,500 infantry and 500 cavalry; four block-houses to Athens, and officer and 30 men each-total, 4 officers and 120 men; Athens, 150 infantry and 150 cavalry; Sulphur Trenste, 150 infantry and 20 cavalry; three block-houses between Sulphur Trestle and Elk River, 4 officers and 90 men; Claysville, 2 officers and 60 men, and 25 cavalry; Whitesburg, 20 infantry and 15 cavalry; Triune, 30 infantry, with an officer. Total infantry effective force, 3.070 enlisted men, and 126 officers; and cavalry, 1070 enlisted men. The effective force of the brigade, and a small detachment of colored troops will give an effective force of about 1,700 men, which will leave 1,370 effective force for minimum garrison. This furnishes no guards for trains or force to operate in the field; this, at least, should be 1,000 more, giving a total effective force of not less than 4,000 infantry and 1,100 or 1,200 cavalry. I wish the general to understand that his is the effective force absolutely required for this district, and I consider that a less force will constantly invite invasions from the south side of the Tennessee River; and this is a very much smaller force than has been employed to hold this road by any officer who has preceded me.

I earnestly request that the general commanding will give this his immediate attention,a nd send me the re-enforcements with as little delay as practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

Since writing the above Colonel Lyon informs me that the officers of the railroad have called upon him for guards to four more stations.
