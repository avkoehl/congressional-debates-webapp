In the opinion of the most loyal and intelligent men throughout the country, the establishment of the Provost-Marshal-General's Bureau as the connecting link between the Government and the people, placing the entire military resources of the country immediately in the hands and at the disposal of the General Government, has proved a most wise and effective measure for the suppression of the rebellion and in the preservation of the Government against the machinations of open enemies as well as the wiles and intrigues of secret foes; the condition of the country being such at the time of its inauguration that it would have been impossible without this measure to have furnished men in available numbers to meet the pressing emergency forces upon us.

The historian who would trace accomplished results to their true and genuine causes must assign to the law constituting this Bureau a most important place among the agencies by which the great work of restoring the national authority has been so happily accomplished. The true turning point of the war was reached when the first "draft wheel" began to revolve, under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1863. The general effect of this law throughout the country has been highly favorable to loyalty. No one department has brought its operations so directly and closely home to the people, or has given such a feeling, of security, such a confidence in and such assurance of the power of the Government to preserve itself, conquer its enemies, and protect all its citizens. Next to the success of its arms, the ability of the Government to bring men into the field at its call, and the manner in which it has been done by this Bureau in the execution of the "enrollment act," in spite of innumerable and apparently insuperable difficulties, has best demonstrated that power.

By the continuance of this Bureau the National Government would not again become dependent upon the will and caprice of the various State Governors, some of whom might, as in times past, be disposed to cripple and break down rather than aid the national authorities.

In the services of a single officer in each disecured the enumeration of he inhabitants, the enrollment of such as are subject to do military duty, and the recruitment of the Army; and if Congress should continue or establish in it the duty of collecting and collating statistics for the Census, Pension, and other bureaus, the interests of the whole country would be advanced, and Government would have machinery in operation that could always be depended on, either for collecting valuable statistics in time of peace or recruiting its armies in time of war, and would be able to know and to use its whole military strength at any moment.

It is impossible to review te Provost-Marshal-General's Bureau without being impressed with the extent and importance of its operations, and the skill and labor required to establish the system throughout the land, and conduct it from noting to its present position of power and success, whereby the authority and influence of the Government is felt in every ward and township throughout the loyal States. Established in the darkest hour of the struggle, the outgrowth of a stern and vital need, it has seen the darkness disappear and the Nation saved, and once more on the high road to prosperity and power.
