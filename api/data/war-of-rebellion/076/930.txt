Just have information that the enemy have struck the Macon road six mils below Jonesborough. General Hood desires you to give all possible assistance to repair the damage. Troops have been sent from here to prevent its destruction as far as possible. Please communicate with Captain Hazlehurst, who is somewhere below, gathering railroad iron. I send this letter by Captain Shoup, my aide-de-camp.

ATLANTA, GA., July 30, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

As soon as I can get the dismounted cavalry General Bragg is to send and the militia here I hope to strike the enemy with my main force. The recent raids have caused delay in receiving the re-enforcements referred to. I hope in a few days to send Wheeler, with his cavalry, to break Sherman's communications. The two recent engagement have checked his extension on both flanks.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
