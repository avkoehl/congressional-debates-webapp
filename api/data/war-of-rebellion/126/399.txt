contrary, everything seemed to prove the ability, foresight, and skill of the generals commanding and of the chiefs of the several staff departments. I am at a loss, too, within the limited space allowed me to set forth the manifold incidents of the march, which was full of interest and information. The experience of commanding officers and of officers of every department was greatly enlarged. That experience will hereafter enable the one with wisdom and the other with competent knowledge to conduct campaigns which will add luster to our arms and greatly promote the interests of our Government with a small loss of life and little expenditure of means.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

Your obedient servant,

HENRY M. WHITTELSEY,

Captain and Actg. Chief Quartermaster Twentieth Army Corps.
