From this exhibit and the accompanying order, Special Orders, Numbers 22, it appears that the minimum cavalry force required for the defense of this department absorbs all the cavalry horses now in

the department. If horses can be furnished a field division of about 5,000 cavalry will be held ready for orders. The Second Missouri (Merrill's) has been reorganized and order to Tennessee. Presuming this department will lose that regiment the detachment has been sent to Memphis. The First Iowa is understood to be temporarily detached, and will proceed to Memphis, Tenn., in obedience to order from headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi, on the return to Pine Bluff of the expedition now proceeding toward Camden.

Very respectfully,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding.
