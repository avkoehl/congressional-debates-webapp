Jiepeal of the Salt Tax—Mr. Benton.
April, 1840.
Senate
was sold lor a bushei oí salt Wds not more irnn a
peck; and this he demonstrated in several difl rent
\v3l\> Fi -t, he-aid, ins nominal bushel of 50
pounds *a< but ha't a mea-uied bu-diei, and this
was proved by all the testimony in relat on to (he
capacity of the bane's, hr all this testimony
proved ihat the barres winch were marked five
bu<he s, u ix tiishels, or nine bushels, could in
reality, hold no m re than two and a hall bushels,
three busheK, or (our and a hall. Th's at once
reduced ú\¿ nom-nal bushel to half a bushel, or
two jecks. Then came ire adulteration, which
was proved to add ttom 25 to 30 pounds to every
50 this would hare to be dednc ed from the two
pecks, and would reduce it 50 p-i cent, or to one
peck and a half. Then came the wastage, dryrge,
leakage, and the weight of the barrel over and
above what was a"owed for the tare, and all th,s
might be sa'ely raiel at half •*> peck: pnl thin the
evidence was complete, th-u ubat was soli lor a
barrel of six bushe1* i t Kina*ha erlt vas in re-
ality no mi>re than six peck-' what th'/called a
busle! wis a peck ' and tbu , all the prices quoted
must be understood as app!) ma; to pet ks, and not
to bushels. This rule would g ve twenty-four dol-
lars a bushel lor bill in Wiskonsin, and as high as
twelve, rr «íx'ecn dollars a bushel for salt in Mis-
souri. It would make the common ra'ea in Mis-
souri range from four to eis^ht dollars a bushd '
Subject-d to a chemical anil^sis-, and Mi B un-
dertook to say that his conclusio i> * ould be veri-
fied to the letter He wished to see it tr,ed, he
wi hed lo see the test applied, and the experiment
made. Let any one in the West purchase a bar-
rel cf this salt at uck weight; let it be analyzed,
and the pure salt measured by the bushel measure,
and the resu't wonH be that six peck measures
would ho'd the content** ora mt bushel barr 1, lick
•weight, ana so on of all tne other barrels fn in the
lowest to the h ghest A barret m?rked five
bushels, would Meld five peck**; cr"  marked 450
pounds, or nine bushels, would yield nine pecks '
and to this imposition the people of the West
are forced to submit; their only reli'f being in the
free importation of foreign salt, which the Federal
Government refuses to p-rmit.
The faLe measure being established, and the de-
ficient quantity proved, Mr. B. said there was
another way to test the quality of this salt, and that
was from its capacity, or rather mcapaci y, to pre-
serve beef or pork in the p>ckled state, or lo make
bacon, wh'ch would bear exportation, or to pr?-
«erve butter, wh'ch s to Le long kep . The que-
ues were diree'ed to th s point, and the answers
weie all explicit, and in the negative, Baccn for
home use, with the h°lp oí drying and smoking,
and much care, might be made wi h it, but no
such bacon cou'd go to the Sou'h, and as for
pickh-d beef and pork, it would not answer in any
climate. All such beef ard pork was excluded
frcm th  army and navy of the TJn.'ed States by
express regulations; and the character of all Wes-
tern sal ed rrciis'ons was injured <n the market by
the suspicion of be ng put up with domesacsalt.
In proof of this, Mr I?, referred to a Idler from a
merchant in Philadelph a, to be *een at page fO,
of lili j-a't document, which, after giving an ac-
count of a quantity of Wes'ern bacon, which
spoiled on the hands of the purchaser, said*
' Dealers arid consuners ere ti eitaint le opun in that meat
put up with domestic sx]t is dangerous to in id e wi h Fei
   ¡here, who -w the said bicoi ial h uns "[Oled in
the hog heads, jscnbtd it tobo the inferior quality of the
domestic salt that ha 1 been n=e * instaures )' c i slated that
lime had hreti ifiit trtlh svrh salt by Ihe manufactiu ei ?,to

the West have experienced ruinou3 losses enough from spoiled
fiacon and hams t i torn meet1 em of the ncres ay ofap| lying
more sea silt and using more care in cunnz properly tl en
salted piovisiors '
The next pj nt tn this h,story of the salt mono-
poly in the West to which Mr. B. called ihe atten-
tion of the Strafe, was the mode of conducting the
trade by means o( dtsrrictirg and allowancng the
country, with general and special agents to super-
intend the sales, and to see that all the regulations
prescribed by the monopolizers, should' e strictly en-
forced. This was a curious head of inquiry, and
the testimony upon it <-hould be full and explicit
The 23 I of the queries applied to this point, and
was in these word*-:

Mr. B. would extend his quotations to one add -
tional head, to show ihat, with all these impositions
in the sa't trade oí tie West, ihere was still one
more etu to hi added—the evil of fcarci'y—the
evil of an insufficient supply, with a rigorous ex-
action of ready meney, and the consequent injury
to stock and ptovision1*, for want of an adeqna'e
supply, and the duresse of the purchaser, in the
hard necessity he was under to take what he cou'd
get, and on such terms as the cruel company pie-
scribed. The supply was ínsuíiicient; and this
very insufficiency was necessary to complete the
success of the general plan. Three of the queries
applied to this point, and were.
' 27 Have the people in yoiu part of the country ever been
so necessi ated for sail as to be obliged to submit to impositions,
and to take such as they coul t get, at uch puce and measure as
the monopolists chose to prescribe, and of such quality as they
offered-!
 *• Is salt sold or bartcied for produce m y our part of «*
country, oi on y for ready moneys
2°. Would the people of your part of the country use more
salt, il they could get it cheapei, and of good quality, and fa"
measure1"
Without following the answers to these queries
county by county, Mr..B. would limit himself hi
a few quotations, tak-m at random.
u2(v  We hav e known salt to be so scarce here on some occa
sions, that the people were compelled, by dire necessitv, totas
it at any price that the sellers thought properto pul tipon
