Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. FERRERO,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Lee's Mill, Va., July 1, 1864-2 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I am in receipt of your note directing me to follow in the direction General Wilson is reported to have gone. I will move in the morning, but it will be at the risk of dismounting my command. I marched from the river without forage and without preparation. My horses are worn out. Some of them have been without forage for forty-eight hours. I am satisfied that General Wilson cannot keep any considerable body of his command together. I thought it best to keep open the roads leading to the south, so that small parties can come in as they are now doing.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
