1854.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Iieve the Post Office Department from insolvency
is fo fasten icon the Treasury of the United States,
it is truly a wondeiful discoveiy; one for which
the gentleman is surely entitled to receive letteia
patent, i am now ready to acknowledge the corn,
and say the gentleman is wondrous sagacious.
But an undutiful son who, perhaps, expends five
hundred dollars a year more than his father would
allow him, might have the same sagacity, and still
draw upon his father's funds to pay the deficiency,
and save himself from insolvency. The gen-
tleman's patent, I think, will meet with ready
sale.
But, sir, the moment you fasten the Post Office
Department upon the Treasury of the United
States, what will be the result? The deficiency
will increase just as they have in the Army and
Kuvy Departments of the Government, until you
run up the expenses of the Post Office Department,
as you have those others, to more than $10,000,000
a year.
But, sir, how is this deficiency to be met? We
must have increased mail facilities for the country.
We are a growing people. This very Congress
has already added two Territories to the United
States. And you must extend the mail facilities
to them. In 1850 you had to extend them to Cal-
ifornia, and Utah, and New Mexico. We are a
mighty and a growing people, and our mail facil-
ities must increase as the population and com-
merce of the country increases. How is it to be
done? The gentleman from Pennsylvania says
fasten it upon the Treasury of the United States.
Jlut how is the deficiency to be met there? By a
tariff, I suppose, will be the answer. The gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Haven] talked feel-
ingly and affectingly the other day about the
correspondence of the servant girls and servant
men, and I might add, too, the laboring men of
the country. Ay, it would not do, he said, to
tax them. But fasten this system upon IheTreas-
uiy,and the servant girl, when she goes to the
store to buy a dress, must, under the tariff oper-
ation, pay indiiectly a tax to supply the deficiency
in the Post Office revenue ? You fasten it upon the
Treasury of the United States, and you fasten the
taxes upon those who do not use the mails of the
country. You fasten it, in spite of all your pro-
testations, upon those articles of dress which
the servant girls and servant men must use and
have.
Mr. HAVEN, (interrupting.) I will say to
the gentleman that if he had only allowed the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to report the tariflfbill
this morning, he would have seen that we propose
to raise our revenue upon iron, silks, and such
articles, of which servant girls and servant men do
not use much.
Mr. OLDS. Who write the letters of the
country ? Not the servant girls," who only, per-
haps, now and then write a letter to make known
their affections to parents in the old country. The
same is true as to servant men. I repeat, sir, who
write the letters, and carry on the large corre-
spondence ?
Again, sir, hear the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Chandler] upon that subject. He
says:
" A gentleman of extensive correspondence cay*5, in reply
to a note from mo . ' A* for letter po^Ms^t*, f pay t<> the De-
partment now certainly per annum more than I did
when the postage was five and ten cents.' "
By this precious morceau we see that it is not
the serving girls and serving men who use most
extensively the mails of the country, but quite a
different class of society.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania has a corre-
spondent who pays $200 more postage under the
three cent rate, than he did tinder the five cent
rate. What must be the amount of his corre-
spondence, when compared with thatof the servant
girls and servant men of the country? And yet
under his proposition, that very correspondent
might not pay any more revenue, under the oper-
ation of the tariff, than that of the servant girl or
servant man; perhaps not as much.
To illustrate it again, a hale farther. It is a
notorious fact, that one of the messengers about
this Hall has been asking the members of the
House, for their document books, that he may
obtain the list of names of those to whom we send
documents. For what purpose is this' A gen-
tleman in Baltimore pays him thirty cents a hun-
dred for copying those names, with their post office
address. It is, sir, that he may know to whom
and where to send his business circulars—perhaps
a lottery scheme in the city of Baltimore. Thu-ty
cents a hundted, sir, to get the names and the ad-
dress of our constituents. Compare his corre-
spondence with thatof the servant man or girl; and
yet he may not pay more revenue, under the
tariff, than do these latter upon the goods they are
compelled to purchase.
I must refer again to the remarks of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. In speaking of the
bill, and the arg-uments urged in its support, he
says:
" Hut, Mr. Chairman, if the plan is wrong—if the bill is
unworthy the acceptance of Congiesd—still more is the
leading portion of the aigumem of ju> utile advocate un-
worthy Ins lame and his position.
" The honorable gentleman who is at the head of the
Post Office Committee demands that the postage be laised
trom thiee to live cents- prepaid, and this, among other
reasons, upon the ground that the West, the agricultural
region*., mutt oiiiei wise be made to fiifler by the cupidity
ot thtj commercial portions of the country, and be com-
pelled to pay for the conveyance of the mail along the sea-
board. Such an argument, or an argument thus founded,
sounds strangely trom the mouth of a s-uue&man , and,
conceding that <humctcr to the chairman of the com-
mittee, 1 profess my elt astonished at the error into which
ins feelings have beuayed him."
Why, sir, it seems to me, if I understand my-
self, that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has
entirely misunderstood my remarks. I do not
suppose that the interests of the people of com-
meicial New York, us respect to correspondence,
are ditferent from those of the agricultural portions
of the West, i suppose the merchant in New
York has just as much interest in having commu- i
nication with the farmer in Ohio as the farmer in j
Ohio has in holding communication with the mer- I
chant in New York. They are equally interested
in having mail facilities kept up between them, and
you cannot, m this respect, separate the interest
of one from that of the other.
My remarks were based upon the supposition
that low postages must result in denying; increased
mail facilities; and that m the Atlantic States their
mail arrangements were perfected; they needed no
increase of mail facilities, but that in the West and
South, in short in almost all the rural districts,
we needed largely increased mail facilities; that
consequently low postages operated against the
interest of the South and West.
Again, the gentleman talks about the expres
carrying letters from Boston to Baltimore for a
penny each, and that, upon every letter passing
between these cities upon which thiee cents are
paid, two cents are paid, for the establishment and
maintenance of mail facilities for the W est. Now,
sir, I repeat, that the commercial men in New
York, or Philadelphia, or Boston, or Baltimore,
are as much interested in having mail facilities at
the West as are the people of the West them-
selves; and theiefore this two cents of which the
gentleman speaks goes to maintain the mail facil-
ities in which the man who pays them directly is
interested.
Sir, the postal system of the United States is a
system in which allure alike interested. New
York is as much interested in having such mail
facilities as will enable letters to pass from New
York to Minnesota or Nebraska, as are the peo-
ple of these Territories. The gentleman from
New York [Mr. Haves] read from the report of
the Postmaster General, to show that after paying
for their own mail facilities, his State paid a large
amount towards defraying the expenses of the
Post Office Department in the sparsely settled
regions of the country. Now, sir, I hold in my
hand an exhibit, furnished me by the Auditor of
the Post Office Department, showing the cost of j
transporting the mail, and the revenues of the (
Department collected m different States of the '
Union. The results differ most materially from .
those furnished by the gentleman from New York. 1
They are of such importance that I will read j
them: !

Now, sir, if the gentleman would charge New
York upon the same rule that he has chained the
other States, he must charge her for the transpor-
tation of the mail from New York to Liverpool,
which would make §800,000 in one lift. Again:
the transportation ot the mail from New York to
San Francisco should be charged to New York,
which will give another lift to that State of
^800,000. When you come to place these charges
to the account of that State, the gentleman will
find that the balance is over the left—it is greatly
against that State.
Sir, it is impossible to make any calculation by
which the proper amount of debt and credit can
he fixed for any one State. If a letter is to be
sent from New York to New Orleans, the postage
is paid in New York; but the expenseof transpor-
tation through the State of New Jersey is charged
to that State; the transportation through a portion
of Pennsylvania must be charged to Pennsylvania,
and in like manner through the States of Mary-
land, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, Sooth
Carolina, Georgia,and Alabama, before it reaches
New Orleans. These facts must all betaken into
consideration in estimating the expenses and re-
ceipts of the Department in any one State. I say,
therefore, that it is utterly impossible to arrive at
anything like a correct conclusion in this respect.
Neither is the solution of the question of the least
piactical importance. Our postal system is not a
local, a Stale institution, but it is, m every sense
of the word—in usefulness, in importance, and in
interest—a national institution.
The exhibit of the Auditor shows some States
and Territories in which hut a tithe of the expense
of the mail facilities is collected in such State or
Territory. This, sir, illustrates the utter futility
of abandoning the postal system to private enter-
prise, as proposed by the gentleman from New
York, [Mr. Smith.]
The carrying the mail must, from necessity,
be a monopoly. Shall it be a Government mo-
nopoly, or shall it he indiuduul monopoly? For
one, sir, I prefer a Government monopoly. Gov-
ernment carries the mails where they do not pay,
as shown by the letter of the Auditor of the Post
Office Department. Private enterprise would not
care for such regions of country. The Govern-
ment does. That is the difference between a Gov-
ernment monopoly and private enterprise. When
gentlemen talk about the destruction of our postal
system, they talk about destroying that which is
the admiration of theOld Woild, Let me read an
extract from the London Morning News of May
17th, to which i call the attention of gentlemen:
"Amfrio^n Postal Statistics.—Sonic time since a
paragraph appeared m the Daily New* on the American
po«.t office system, containing s-ome interesting statistics,
derived from document presented io> Congress, Since tliat
other documents; from the waine source have been published,
