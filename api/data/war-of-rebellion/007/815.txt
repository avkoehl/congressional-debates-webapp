HEADQUARTERS, Knoxville, January 1, 1862.

S. COOPER, Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: My brigade is composed partly of companies organized in East Tennessee and in part of West Tennesseans. Colonel White's regiment, composed exclusively of East Tennesseans, is well equipped, having muskets. This regiment is very near General Zollicoffer's encampment in Southeastern Kentucky. Another regiment, four companies of which were organized by myself, and ordered to Fort Pillow, on the Mississippi, below Columbus, by order of General Pillow, are well armed. Colonel Looney's regiment, made up of Eastern and Western Tennessee companies, is at this post, under orders to march on to-morrow to join General Zollicoffer. Many of this regiment are on the sick list. I have arms enough for all whoa re able to march.

When I organized these regiments I advised the War Department that I had 1,620 Tennessee rifles, and requested an order upon the ordnance departments of Nashville and Memphis to have these weapons remodeled. Of these guns, upon the orders issued in September last, I have received 520 with the saber bayonet attached. I have in addition to the above 200 muskets. These will complete the equipment of Colonel Looney's regiment, which has orders to move on, as before stated. I will have enough guns to equip Colonel Gillespie's regiment within thirty days.

I have assurances from Colonel Hunt, of the Memphis ordnance department, that my guns shall be forwarded as rapidly as possible. The Government shops in this place are now actively employed in repairing the guns collected at this post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. H. CARROLL,

Brigadier-General.
