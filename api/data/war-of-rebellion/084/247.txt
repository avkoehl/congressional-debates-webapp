I do not wish the command. I will try, with my regiments, to keep my sub-district all night, and will also be ready to move and aid any of my neighboring districts. It needs a good, thorough military man to command that county. If any change is made, I would respectfully suggest the name of General Totten.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, July 18, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Following dispatch just received:

LEXINGTON, July 18, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER KANSAS CITY:

Dispatch just received from Captain Whitmer states that from 300 to 400 of Thornton's rebels at 4 p.m. yesterday were ten miles west of Richmond, marching in the direction of that place, and that another force farther north was also marching east. Their object is to cross the river east of this place. I desire a section of artillery immediately. Major Suess, with his force, boat, and artillery, should move here immediately. Answer and let me know what Major Suess will do and where he is.

JAS. McFERRAN,

Colonel First Cavalry Missouri State Militia, Commanding.

I immediately ordered Major Suess, with steamer Fanny Ogden and one section of battery, to move down and prevent their crossing. He will be off in fifteen minutes. Have destroyed all small boats and flat-boats on the river.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 18, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD:

I think it would be best to go after those rascals. Will notify General Curtis and ask him to help you at Kansas City. You will, therefore, prepare for and push Thornton's bands on the river, at some point where you can secure them. I must leave you to be governed as to the point by circumstances; but make your moves so as to bring them up as far west as possible.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, July 18, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I start back immediately and shall move my whole force down the river; but it will leave my own counties unprotected. Will do the best I can. If Thornton or Todd in any way murders or molests my troops I will take my revenge on my return out of those rebel counties on the opposite side of the river.

JAS. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.
