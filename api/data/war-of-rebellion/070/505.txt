SANDY HOOK, May 20, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER,

Harper's Ferry:

It is reported to me this morning that there are about 300 horses at the Dismounted Camp, and Lieutenant-Colonel Middleton claiming on that plea that he should remain. These horses were not there day before yesterday. Please find out if Captain Gardner has sent over any since that time; also number necessary to mount the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry. I think the report of horses a mistake. Answer requested.

C. S. BOWMAN,

Captain, Commanding U. S. Cavalry.

BALTIMORE, May 20, 1864.

General MAX WEBER:

Sherman's is our only column making any rapid progress. Grant has had another fight with Lee, but without results. Butler is again quiet. Nothing from far southwest. War Department says Grant has fully as many men as when first moved two weeks ago. Great fighting expected to-day. The American has our statement to-day, but Tribune will have editorial and letter besides to-morrow. Major-General Hunter and horses leave Washington for Harper's Ferry about noon to-day with special train ordered from Washington.
