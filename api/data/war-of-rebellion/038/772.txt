OFFICE CHIEF OF SUBSISTENCE, DEPARTMENT OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA, April 20, 1863.

R. W. MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-General, Jackson:

MAJOR: In reply to a communication from department headquarters, asking for information as to the arrangements made "to keep up the supply of subsistence at Port Hudson," I have the honor to state that supplies will be sent, as required, via Osyka. Port Hudson is better supplied now than any post in the department. Captain Chrisman is in the neighborhood of Port Hudson, gathering together beef-cattle belonging to the Government that were turned loose from herd last winter. They are, I am informed, in good condition, and will be sent to Port Hudson as they are wanted.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THEO. Johnston.
