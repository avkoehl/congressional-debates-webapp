ASAHEL BUSH.
Mr. LANE introduced a joint resolution author-
izing the settlement of the accounts of Asahel
Bush, public printer of the Territory of Oregon;
which was read a first and second time,^nd re-
ferred to the Committee on Territories.
Mr. LETCHER. J wish to inquire of the gen-
tleman from Oregon if that resolution involves a
question in regard to any law under which this
account accrued ?
Mr. LANE. The territorial printer ofOregon,
by direction of the Legislature, executed certain
punting, for which he has not been paid. An
appropuation for that pm pose, which has long
since been made, has not been expended, and the
object of the joint resolution is to provide that out
of the money appropriated for that purpose, this
man may be paid for the services rendered. We
ask for no money.
Mr. LETCHER. If the money has been ap-
propriated for this particular purpose, and this
man did the work, I cannot see why he cannot
get the money.
The SPEAKER. The bill has been referred.
MILITARY ROAD IN OREGON.
Mr. LANE introduced a bill making an appro-
priation for the completion of the military road

ferred to the Committee 011 Military Affairs.
Mr. LANE. I have another bill I desire to
inti odaee.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I must object, un-
less there is a general relaxation of the 'rule. I
design, when the Territories have been called, to
introduce a resolution that all the States and Ter-
ritories be called again.
Air. HOUSTON. Let the Delegates get in
their bills.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. No, sir; I must
insist 011 my objection; but the difficulty will be
obviated in a few moments, [ trust, by the adop-
tion of the resolution which I design to offer.
PRIVATE LAND CLAIMS IN NEW MEXICO.
Air. OTERO. I ask leave to introduce a bill i
to ascertain and settle private land claims in the '
Territory of New Mexico.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I object.

Mr. OTERO. I ask leave, then, to introduce
a bill supplemental to an act approved July 22,
1854, entitled "An act to establish the office of
surveyor general of New Mexico, Kansas, and
Nebraska, to grant donations to actual settlers
therein, and for other purposes."
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I must object, for
the same reason that I objected to the bill of the
gentleman from Oregon.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from New
Mexico has not yet introduced one bill.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. Then Withdraw
the objection; let him get in one bill.
The" bill was then read a first and second time,
and referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. OTERO. I have other bills which I desire
to offer.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I object.
roads in washington territory.
Mr. STEVENS, of Washington, introduced a
bill for the completion of military roads in the
Territory of Washington; which was readafirst
and second time, and referred to the Committee

other bill which I desire to offer.

Mr. ABBOTT presented resolutions of the
Legislature of the State of Maine, relating to for-
eign paupers and criminals; which were referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary, and ordered
to be printed.
suppression of polygamy.
Mr. MORRILL introduced a bill to punish and
prevent the practice of polygamy in the Territo-
riesof the United States, and other places; which
was read a first and second time.
Mr. LETCHER. I ask that the bill may be
read. I must know what it proposes before I can
tell whether to object to it or not.
The SPEAKER. The bill has been read a
second time. What committee does the gentle-
man ftom Vermont propose to refer it to?
Mr. MORRILL. I move that it be referred to
the Committee on Territories.
Mr. READY. I suppose the Committee on
the Judiciary would be the appropriate committee
to which to refer it.
Mr. GROW. No, sir. It belongs to the Com-
mittee on Territories. The domestic institutions
of the Territories are under the control of that
committee.
Mr.READY. The bill proposes, as I under-
stand it, to pass a law imposing a penalty for, or
providing for the punishment of crime; and I
think, therefore, that it comes properly under the
jurisdiction of the Committee 011 the judiciary.
Mr. MORRILL. I have 110 objection to the
refercncc of the bill to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. If the House prefers that it should
reccive that reference, I have no objection.
Mr. KEITI\ I object to that reference; and
move that the bill be referred to the Committee
on Naval Affairs. [Laughter.]
Mr. MORRILL. I will not press the motion
to refer the bdl tcJ the Committee on Territories.
Mr. KEITP. I withdraw my motion.
Mr. GROW. I desire to read the rule defining
the duties of the Committee on Territories, and
the House will then see that this bill properly
belongs to that committee. The rule is as fol-
lows:
It shall be the duty ofthe Committee on Territories to
examine into tiie legislative, civil, and criminal piocecdings
ot the Tcrutorie-?, and to dÂ«\i&y and report to the House
sueh means a-s, in their opinion, may he necessary to secure
the rights and piivilcges ot*residents and non-residents."
Now, this bill relates to the domestic institu-
tions of one of the Territories. It properly be-
longs. therefore, to the Committee on Territories,
and I hope the House will refer it to that com-
mittee.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I suppose it is not
in order to debate this question; but I suggest to
the House that the Congress of the United States
