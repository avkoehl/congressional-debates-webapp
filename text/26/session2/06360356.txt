«was passed from the Comra ttee of tbe Whole mio
the Houce, prevented the gentleman from express-
Big his views relative to his amendment. He, sir,
is not very active in obtaining the floor. It is an
honor to hira that he is not. His (Mr. Gkeen's)
lamem'Sa was produced by serving his country in
tbe field, undei the heio of Tippecanoe. J hope,
hereafter, the country will have his valuable aid in
assisting him unier whom he served in war, to
carry out in peace the great measures necessary for
the good of the country We want a few more
such men—such as arc attentive to their business,
ready and true to their principles—who prefer do-
ing their daly by voting to consuming the time of
the House by speeches. The gentleman will par-
don me in giving expression to my feelings by thus
referring to him. He is tbe last man, I know,
who would speak cf his own services.
Another "sign" was the resolution of my fnend
from New York, [Mr. Barnard ] His resolution,
so far from conflicting with the compromise act,
expressly proposes to imposeduties "on wines, silks,
linens, gpices, Jand other articles, being luxuries,"
"but in such a manner as not to conflict with the
prancip.es, policy, and spirit of the act of March,
1833, commonly called the compromise act"
Surely, sir, this '."sign" of a tariff exists only in the
imagination of the gentleman from Virginia
As to the "sign" of my amendment, I have al-
ready referred to that.
But the gentleman from Virginia thinks, or seems
to intimate, that some purpose is entena'ned of
violating the provisions of the compre mise act of
March, 1833
I have heard of no proposition from any quatter
to disturb the compromise act Although it was
passed «gainst the "wishes of a large portion of the
North, still they seem, with the best motives I know,
to be disposed to give it a fa>r trial. Acting like
patriots, they desire to give peace to the country
They evince a most noble spir t of concession for
the sake of harmony, which we ought to appreciate
I deny, sir, that the amendment which 1 proposed
to the Treasury note bill will be any infraction of
the terms or the spirit of the compromise 1 con-
cur with the gentleman, that we ought not to disturb
the act, tp interfere with it at all, "without an actual
and unavoidable necessity." But I maintain that
that necessity [now exists, and I humbly think 1
have proved it.
The Secretary tells as—"It is believed that the
reduction of the duties on imports, which, by the
existing tariff, will take place in the year 1842,
cannot vary much from five millions of dollars "
I concur in all that has been said in favor of the
compromise. It was not an ordinary act of legis
lation. It did come ' with healing on its wings "
It originated in the breast of the greatest statesman
of h¡is day, from an anxious wish to allay a trouble-
some excitement. It saved many gallant spirits from
being subjected to the mthleaspower of the chief, who
declared he wished to hang them If the great man
who struggled so hard against such fearful odds.,
and finally accomplished his magnanimous and
noble purpose, had no other claim to immortality
tbaii this, he would deserve to be gratefully remem-
bered while virtuous actions continue to excite the
admiration of the good
The great and leading principle of the compro-
mise act is as sfeted by the Secretary of the Treasury
in his -eport to the Senate Speaking of the stipu-
lations contained in the compromise, he says
"The lint seems to be that a reduction by instalments of the
former rate of duties when exceeding twenty hve per cent
should forthwith commence and continue unmteiruptej until
July J, 1842 so that, when that peihd arrived, no duties what
ever should exceed 20 per cent
In this 1 believe we all concur
I agree also with the Secretary when he gives the
following opinion
"Another restriction, supposed to have been intended, j* tluit
if a revision be made to operate after June 30th 1842, instead of
before,sti!l,asageneralruIe, none of the duties "hall bie then
raised above twenty per rent, Thus, the cto'tof ihe 5th sec
Uonprovides thaU'all imports on which the first seen n of this
«tptmay operate, and all anieles now admitted to entry free
from duty, or paying a less rate of duty than twenty percent
ad valorem before the said 30th ot June, 1843, fiom and after
Uto Jay maybe admitted to entry subject to such duty not ex
ceedmg twenty per cent ad valorem as shall be provided by
law ' A change could then be made at pleasure irom twenty
per cent downwards to enure freedom from impost, but no m
«reas  was- to Be pefrmtteij tojgo aboye ttyat rate "
It is true, sir, one of the sections of the act, the
■OMEXTO THE eOÍSCcitESSIOlTAL

1 fourth, provides that Certain luxuries, until the
30th June, 1842, shall be admitted to entry "free
of duty," but then the sixth section of the act con-
tains the following proviso
' Pi ovided, 1 hat nothing herein contained shall be so con
strued as to prevent the pis«age, pi lor or subsequent to the said
thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty
two, of any act or acts, irom time t9 time, that -nay be neces
sary to detect, prevent, or pan sh evasions of the duties on im
poitsimposed by law, nor to prevent the passage of any act
prior to the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred
and forty two, in the contingency eithei of excess or deficiency
of revenue ' &c &c
I endeavored to regard strictly the compromise
act, when I offered the amendment I think it
was regarded, for nothing is clearer than the fact
that there is now a "deficiency of revnue "
If I understood my friend from Virginia cor-
rectly, he said the first or mam principie of the
compromi«e act was, that the ariff should be a ta-
riff for revenue, and that "protection was abandon-
ed " In this, with all respect for the gentleman, I
venture to say he is very much mistaken In the
report from Mr Woodbury from which he quoted,
Mr. W. states expressly that the interests of the ma-
nufacturer were consulted in the compromise act.
If he will consult the debates of the day, he must
see that Mr Clay all along denied that protection
was to be abandoned Mr Clayton, who took an
active and important part in passing the compro-
mise act, said, before he would consent that protec-
tion should be abandoned, he would let the compro-
mise act fail I think, upon reflection, the gentle-
man, who is better acquainted with the debates of
the day than I am, will see m this he is in error I
know in this opinion the gentleman from Souih
Carolina [Ml Rhbti] concurs with the gentleman
from Virginia, but really, Mr Chairman, the pol -
ticians from South Carolina differ so widely upon
almost all subjects from all other persons, that I ge-
nerally think to go opposite to what they recom-
mend is to go right
While speaking upon this subject of protection,
let me say, Mr Chairman, that gentlemen need not
any longer attempt to delude the public mind by
any outcry upon this subject. The gentleman from
South Carolina, [Mr. Rhett ] especially, I nought,
seemed anxious to raise an outcry against a protec-
tive tariff I wish to '■ay somethmg presently in
reference to the peculiar opinions of that gentle-
man, and before 1 do so, let me say, I wish to do
so in no spirit of unkmdness I wi«h to speak of
political opinions alone I do not intend to say any
thing calculated to wound the feelings of any gen-
tleman from that State
But let me remark, ao to this protective tariff,
that when the question comes up for consideration,
I shall be ready to meet it, and to aU upon it And,
sir, wher my friend from Vtr;ima says, "Southern
gentlemen dare not vole for a protective tariff" let
me tell him, in all humiht}', he has no right to
speak thus for Siuthern gentlemen L«t me teli
him, here, before the next eleotion in my district,
that North Carolina Whigs do "dare to support a
protective tariff" whenever they become satisfied
the interest of our great countiy requires it Yea,
sir, we dare, I hope, do all that may become men
A tariff may not only protect Northern manufac-
tures, but a tariff may protect commerce and agr -
culture May not our cotton reqwe protection,
and ihat at no distant day? Does not our tobacco
already require some legislative protection? The
time may come, sir, when my own State shall be
sufficien ly aware of Iit own great «tieigih and
power—when she will arouse to a proper sense of
her own capability, of her immense resources—
when she may, as I hope she will, avail herself if
the benefit' conferred upon her by a kind Provi-
dence, and turi her attention to rnanu,actum g,
the time may speedily corpe when we shall demand
of our Government a pro ectrte tariff And when
that time amve>, yes, before then, if any gieat
b anch of American industry rcquiies protection, I
shall de'm myself unworthy a seat on tus floor, it,
by any fear of the unpopularity of the measure, I
shall be deterred from supporting it While, sir,
I acknowledge the great power of my friend frota
, Virginia, while I am proud to admit that his oppo-
sition is calculated to make any measure odious,
let me téll him,sir, hers much mistaken if he thinks
North Carolina, as a part of the South, "dare not
| go for a protective tariff    Let not the gentleman

lay "the flattering unction to his soul" that he can,
by the magic of hio name, prevent the Whig paity
of the Southern countiy irom advocating whatever
they may think right and proper. No, sir, in the
old North State, thank God, we are free. We have
declated our independence of the ridiculous ab-
stractions which tied us to the car of Virginia.
We have seen the error of our ways our peeople,
remembering the noble conduct ot our State in
1775, when she took the lead of her proud sister,
have determined to think and act tor themselves.
Yes, sir, she took the lead m 1775, when our Meck-
lenburg Declaration of Independence was declared,
and if we have been under Virginia ínfluesce, it
was not when our country was assailed by foreign
domestic foe" Not only in 1775 did we go ahead
of Virginia, but I am proud to say that in 1840 we
did likewise. Yes, sir, after the result of elections in
Virginia was well known, our people went to tbe
polls, each man knowing he was discharging an
important duty to his country, and feeling grateful
that he s'ill had a right to exert a proper influence
througn the ballot-box over the action of his repre
sentauves
[Mr. Eavner here interrupted Mr Stanlv, and
said he hoped his colleague would allow him to
ask if he understood him correctly in what he had
said of a protective tariff From what he had
heard, he was satisfied Mr S had been mnunder-
stood ]
Mr Stanly said, my colleague is right, sir, in
sajing I have been misunderstood, if it is alleged I
advocate a "protective tariff" As far as I have
heard, no one on this floor has preterded to advo-
cate a protactive tariff It is a false alarm, raised
by certain persons here, that they may, it possible,
induce some tanfl man to recommend it, to give
them an excuse for indulging m a little blustering
talk. I did say, however, sir, that if it hereaftei
became necessary to the welfare of the country to
resort to a protective tariff—if the peopie of North
Carolina should think her interests required it, I
should not be driven from the support of it because
South Carolina representatives had threatened us
that they would not submit to it. If hereafter
Texas should, as she may, raise cotton enough to
supply our Northern manufacturers, I think it very
probable tho South would not very strongly object
to a little protection If Great Britain succeed  in
her plan of raising cotton in India, and can supply
her manufacturers from that source, which will de-
prive us of a market m England, a pioteclive tariff
to keep out foreign cotton, to enable us to s>ell outs
to our Noithein manufacturers, would not be so
unacceptable to the South as some of us may ima-
gine I really have beard a protective tatiff so
much denounced from a certain quarter that I be-
gin to think it cannot be half as bad as many South-
ern gentlemen have thought
But, sir, my friend from Virgim-i seemed to think
that there is some charm in the word "tariff,"
which can call spirits irom the vasty deep ' He
speaks of it as if it were «is terrible a monster as.
that described by Milton, as seen by Satan at the
gates of Hell—
A foi nndaWe shape,
Biack it stood as night,
Tierce as ten funes, terrible as hell "
Yes, sir, one would think, from the horror ex-
pressed by himself and some of the members from
South Carolina of a tariff, iliat it was a monster
threiienmg to attack the South, levelling his dead-
ly aim—
^.ndlike a cometbumel,
1 hat fired the length of Ophiuchus huge,
In the arctic <*kv and from hi* horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war
I have no doubt, sir, in some parts of our coun-
try, where reading, \,ntmg, and arithmetic (the
three r's, I think, they wore once called) are
thought to be aristocratic arts, and where "direct
taxation" is regarded as the only Demoeratic way
of raising revenue for the Govern nam— I have no
doubt in such places a tariff is be íevtd to be some
"highland blood" Abolitionist that wi 1 liberate all
the slaves, and sell all the "resp ctab e poor neigh-
bor men and women " But what i> "a tar.ff" It
is a table of duties on goods, or a book of rates—a
declaration by law of the duties to be paid at the
