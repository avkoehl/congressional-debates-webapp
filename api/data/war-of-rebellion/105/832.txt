As there will remain at Camp Drum only the four companies of the Second Cavalry, the fifty cords of wood that I requested to be sent forward by the Senator on the her next trip need not be shipped. I trust that this may reach you in time to prevent incurring the heavy expense that would otherwise be involved. I shall push on to Camp Wright to-morrow morning.

Respectfuly, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding
