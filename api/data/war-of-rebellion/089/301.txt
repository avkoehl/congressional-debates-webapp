The following dispatch just received from Captain Hallett, gun-boat Foster, who commanded the expedition to Smith's Point, sent out in retaliation of the capture of the light-house keeper:

I went to Smith's Point, up Coan River, and also Great Wicomico, besides several creeks. Had several skirmishes with the rebels and two smart little skirmishers - killed and wounded about thirty rebels;none of us hurt. Have on citizens and three other prisoners -one, I believe, a captain in the Second Georgia Regiment. The country is full of home guards. I killed the captain of one company.
