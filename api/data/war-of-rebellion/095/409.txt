the parapet between the sections C-D and F-E. There should be but four, there being but one 10-inch gun near the 8-inch mortar instead of two. From the list it will be seen that of twenty-one heavy guns and three mortars on the land front six guns and three mortars were serviceable at the capture and of twenty-three guns on the sea front seventeen were serviceable at the same time.

Very respectfully,

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General, Chief Engineer.

General RICHARD DELAFIELD,

Chief Engineer.
