Major-General WRIGHT,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

Your are mistaken in regard to the usage of issuing ordnance stores. But upon your representation that the service requires such issue in Kentucky your order to Captain Edson need not be countermanded, and he will be instructed to make issues upon the requisition of the State authority in accordance with that order.

The twelve-months" recruits in kentucky will be allowed the $25 bounty and advance pay, and instructions will be given the disbursing officer accordingly. Yielding to the peculiar exigency in your State, I shall also authorize ordnance stores to be issued on requisition of State authorities by Captain Edson, but request that care be taken to avoid doubles issues, and also to see that the arms issued are properly disposed of. The disposition of the Department is to afford you every possible aid.
