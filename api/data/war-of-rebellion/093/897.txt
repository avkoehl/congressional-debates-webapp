If the general concludes to send cavalry after this party, as I have strongly recommended, I should like to know about the matter, as they would probably returned down Flint River if approached from the north, and might be waylaid by other infantry.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., November 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Nashville:

I have just received your dispatch of this morning, directing me to send to New Market to find a rebel force referred to by General Granger. Since sending Colonel Capron to Mount Pleasant I have no cavalry available for that purpose, and in view of the last report from General Hatch it would be probably unwise to send infantry. Please inform me of the general's wishes on the subject.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 15, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The Fifth Tennessee Infantry is here. Where do you wish it sent?

W. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., November 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Nashville:

Please send the Fifth Tennessee Infantry to this place.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

PULASKI, November 15, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have nothing from General Hatch since 1 o'clock this morning, but hope he will give me reliable information of the enemy's movements to-morrow morning. I will have everything ready to move promptly if it becomes necessary. I do not believe Hood will come this way with his infantry. He may move north, via Centreville, or possibly Columbia; but, I think, more probably will send his cavalry on a raid, while he occupies our attention and holds the ground necessary to cover their retreat. When will Smith be at Nashville?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
