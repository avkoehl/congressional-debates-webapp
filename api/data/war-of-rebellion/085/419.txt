FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 27, 1864.

Captain J. H. STEGER,

Sedalia:

I have received orders from General Curtis to move south. When will troops arrive in Fourth Sub-District to relieve me? I shall abandon Independence and Hickman Mills and move to Pleasant Hill, and there await further orders from General Curtis. I shall leave a small force at Kansas City of my regiment and order out the Enrolled Missouri Militia and Home Guards. Would respectfully ask that the general court-martial now sitting at Independence either be disbanded or sent to Pleasant Hill.

Colonel Second Colorado Cavalry.

Lieutenant CLARKE,

Aide-de-Camp, Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Leave at once for Macon and come over here with Colonel Kutzner's command. Bring with you all the mail requiring my personal attention. Take the 1.40 train to-day, if possible. I need you much. Lieutenant Hayward, if well, will come with you. Telegraph him. Answer.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

RENICK, September 27, 1864.

Brigadier General CLINTON B. FISK:

By order of General Douglass I came here to-day and heard of the capture of the train and murder of the soldiers on it. I will move forward toward Sturgeon early in the morning, unless you dispatch me to the contrary. I suppose you have more and later news than I have. They are reported to me to have moved east from Centralia. I can probably hear later news at Sturgeon. I send this by messenger to Allen to be telegraphed. I will send back everything with which I can dispense from this place to Macon, and be prepared to move with the utmost dispatch.

DAN. M. DRAPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia.
