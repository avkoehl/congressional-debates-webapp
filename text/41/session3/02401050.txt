George Cowie, Thomas L. Tullock, Brainard
H. Warner, and H. B. Croggon.
Mr.PATTERSON. I moveto amend the bill
in section four, line eleven, by inserting alter
the word " estate " the words "worth twice the
amount of the loan;" so that the clause will
read:
Or loaned on a pledge of any of said fund?, or
invested in lands on mortgages of real estate worfii
twice the amount of the loan.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. PATTERSON. I move further to
amend the bill in section eight, line three, by
striking out the word " returns" and inserting
the word "report."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. PATTERSON. In the twelfth line of
the eighth section I move the same amend-
ment, to strike out the word "return" and
insert the word " report."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. CORBETT. I noticed in the reading
of the bill that it allows this bank to invest
its funds in the stock of any bank. The ques-
tion in my mind is whether it should not be
confined to national banks. Otherwise, they
might be invested in a private bank or some
banking institution which had no security.
Mr. PATTERSON. I will accept that
amendment.
Mr. CORBETT. Then I move to insert the
word "national" before the word "bank."
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I do not
see any necessity for that amendment; and
while 1 am on the floor allow me to remaik
further that I do not see the necessity of
entering upon the consideration of any ot these
bills at this time. These are general bills to
affect this District. The territorial bill has
passed both Houses, and is now in the hands
of a committee of conference; and yet we
undertake to legislate here on subjects that
will belong exclusively to the government to
be formed under that territorial bill. I think
this system of general legislation ooght to be
deferred, at ail events until we see the action
of Congress upon that bill.
The honorable Senator from New Hamp-
shire knows generally the condition of that bill.
He is a member of the conference committee.
He knows what will be done with it. I do not
know what may be done w ith it. But if there
is a probability of the passage of that bill by
Congress there is no occasion lor any ot the
legislation contemplated by any ot these meas-
ures now before this body. On the contrary,
there is every reasou why nothing should be
. done. If the people of the District ot Colum-
bia are to govern themselves in their local
matters let them do so. They ean begin in a
few weeks. These measures are not pressing,
Some of the measures that are to be considered
by us to-day I know are obnoxious to ttie peo-
ple of the District of Columbia. If we intend
to give any virtue to that territorial govern-
ment let us do so. Let us not trammel thera
by any hasty legislation. Let them attend to
their own affairs, if we contemplate that they
shall do so.
Mr. PATTERSON. The Committee on the
District of Columbia have had the territorial
bill under consideration, and have had these
other bills under consideration; they have
considered the whole matter which the Senator
has spoken of. and in thejudgmentofthe cotn-
> mittee these bills should be acted upon. So
