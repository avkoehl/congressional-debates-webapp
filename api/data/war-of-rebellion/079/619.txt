Major ECKERT:

Telegraph cut north of Bowling Green last night by partisan band; therefore no report. On the 1st General Croxton made reconnaissance and found enemy intrenched at Florence, with pontoon bridge laid, and infantry and artillery crossing still. It is reported the railroad is working from Mobile through Corinth and Tuscumbia to the south end for their bridges. Forrest has appeared on the opposite bank of the Tennessee River, near Johnsonville, and to- day, assisted by gun-boat Numbers 55 (which he captured two days since near Fort Heiman), attacked our gun-boats at that post, but suffered repulse, and withdrew his infantry out of range, while the gun-boat went up the river out of range, but not out of sight, and was there at dark. Railroads and telegraphs all working.
