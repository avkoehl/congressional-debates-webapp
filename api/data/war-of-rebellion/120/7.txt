Respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Captain MELVIN, Assistant Adjutant-General, Cumberland:

I inclose herewith copies of papers found on the person of Mr. Dooley, who was arrested some time since and carried to Richmond. Two citizens of Winchester were held as hostages, but they declared Dooley had on his person my pass authorizing him to recruit negroes. I informed them that being the case Dooley would have to be considered a prisoner of war, but denied ever having seen Dooley or ever authorizing any one to give such a pass, and requested the proof, promising to release them as hostages if they substantiated their charge. They have sent in these papers, in which I can find nothing that makes Dooley a Government agent.

I respectfully submit the case, but would recommend that at least Mr. Boyd be brought in and held until Mr. Dooley is returned.

I remain, respectfully,

JER. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

WINCHESTER, March 14, 1864.
