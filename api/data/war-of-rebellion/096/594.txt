HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,February 19, 1865.

General RAWLINS:

The following received from General Gordon:

NORFOLK, February 19, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

General Palmer has ordered the troops at Coinjock to report to him. They are two companies-one of them white, Thirteenth New York Heavy Artillery, the other colored, all under Major McLaughlin. Both these companies belong to regiments in this command. Many applications have been made to have these men relieved from General Palmer's command, but evidently General Palmer does not intend to do so. We cannot prevent smuggling with the force here, even with those at Coinjock. About 500 men have reported; about 1,000 more are needed.

GEO. H. GORDON,

Brigadier-General.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, February 19, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

General Palmer has been directed to relieve the two companies mentioned in General Gordon's dispatch and order them to report to General Gordon at Norfolk immediately.

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
