to get a battle at once out of the enemy, I think we should advance to the Danville railroad, which will undoubtedly bring the enemy out of his entrenchments, and we can have an open fight. At present we cannot take much artillery with us, and would not need much in such a movement. We can't use any in advance directly on Petersburg. I think our plan should be to establish a good line across to the plank road, with a good sized fort at this point where we can leave our artillery and a supply of ammunition, and then take every available man and go to the Danville road. If we advance against Petersburg I venture to say that we shall fare no better than heretofore in such attempts east of the Jerusalem plank road.
