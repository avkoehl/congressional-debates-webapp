200 yards from 16-foot water to 16-foot water across the gap. The land is but 30 feet high as an average, and we should have for a 50-foot cut but about 55,000 cubic feet of excavation, or ten days' labor for 1,000 men. By that means our iron-clads could get out and Howlett would be useless. If you will look upon the map you will get my idea at once. I have made my examination by the Coast Survey map. I should not depend on the current to do any part of the cutting, as at Vicksburg although it might help. The gun-boats cover the place.
