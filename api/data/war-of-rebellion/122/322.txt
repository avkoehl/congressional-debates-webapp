Geneva, Switzerland:

SIRS: I very much regret that the Government could not accept the generous offer which you make through the U. S. consul at Geneva. We have already an army composed of more than 300,000 men, a number greater than we need for the actual crisis.

Expressing sincerely my appreciation of the honor conferred by your devotion to the cause of the liberty and sovereignty of our great Republic, I have the honor to be, sirs, your devoted servant,

SIMON CAMERON.
