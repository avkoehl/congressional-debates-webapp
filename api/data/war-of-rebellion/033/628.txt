Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Colonel Cole, with his command, arrived at 6 o'clock this morning. This command gives me about 1,100 men at this point. I hope additional militia in to-day, and then if I can leave Jefferson City out of danger, I will propose a movement up the road. Crittenden, who remain up the road, telegraphs as follows from California:

Just in on locomotive. Discovered 100 rebels 3 miles west of Tipton, on railroad. Drove them back; killed 1. All around Tipton. We have fallen back with locomotive.
