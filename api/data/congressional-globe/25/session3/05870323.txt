vented had the proposed delay of two years been
eliowed That it was not allowed is to be attrib-
uted to the miudicious, and, if I may say so, the
obstinate com se of the Executive of Geoigia, and
to the want of firmness of our own I have spoken
of the conseauences of that hasty remova , not
of any intention to produce them
it was not my intention when I came here, to
have said one word on subjects that are past.
The southern Indians have been íemoved—they
are gone I was disposed to let all past contro-
versies rest. But, sir, I could not in silence sub-
mit to the sweeping denunciation of the message
that all the charges heretofore brought against the
Executive, on the subject of our Indian relations,
were " undeserved reproaches," " unjustimputa-
tions," or " misrepresentations," nor that history
should falsify facts, however much to our credit,
that, for the last ten years, all our dealings with
the Indians have been just, or that we have ful-
filled all our tieaty stipulations with the Indian
tribes, and I have to say that, so often as such
denunciations and assertions shall be repeated,
as often will the charges be restated
EXECUTIVE POWER
SPEECH OP HON WILLIAM SLADE,
OP VERMONT,
In the House of Representatives,
February 22, 1839
An amendment to the bill making ippropnations for the
civil and diplomatic expenses of the Govermm nt for the
year 1&Í9, being under consideration in Committee of the
Whole on the stale of the Union-
Mr SLADE said that it had not been his in-
tention to trouble the House, during the present
session, with any remarks on the great questions
which divide the leading parties in the country
It was always with extieme  reluctance that he
addressed the House, and he felt his  ordinary
embarrasbment much increased  by a considera-
tion of the extent and fullness of the discussions
which these questions  had   recently undergone
here and elsewhere     He had  not the vamly to
suppose that he could  adduce any new facts, or
■urge any new arguments, yet he deemed thepres
ent a cusís when it is incumbent on every man to
do  his duty and his whole duty, and when it
becomes no man to  stand still until he can " do
some great thing," before he attempts anything,
but to do, according to his ability, whatevei Ins
hands find to do with all his might     In the fear-
ful stiuggle going on between Executive power
and   constitutional freedom, every man   should
feel that he has a deep stake, and that the efforts
of the feeblest and the humblest may not be una
vailing to turn the scale and secure a victory     If
I can Influence but a single mind, if I can louse
but a single freeman, and give to i. s efforts a right
direction, I shall be amply rewarded
But, sir, I have other motives for addressing
this committee It has been my lot to stand on this
floor as an opponent of slavery, and to be iden-
tified with those who are sometimes reproached
as being men of" one idea," in the contempla
tion of which they are so engrossed as to ovei look
allothei public in'erests I am willmgto bear the
reproach of being opposed to slavery, here and
everywhere I am not ashamed to own that, on
this subject, I think much and feel deeply But,
sir, so far from forgetting other interests, m my
desire for the emancipation of the enslaved, the
contemplation of the great pnnciples o/jusitcewhich
lie at the foundation of that cause does but inspire
me with a firmer purpose to maintain another
cause with which those principles arc deeply iden-
tified
I am opposed to slivery of every kind, to sla-
very ofraitid and slavery of body, to the slavery
whose silken cords aie aitfully coiled aiou id the
spuits of freemen, as well as to the harsh ard
cruel oondage which forces the <uveat and toil of
him who moves ai the bidding of a task-raster
S r, I cannot stand still and set co"iaPTiof stalk-
ing through th s lard, and crushing eve ytl ing
beneath its tread, without standing up and oppos
ing my feeble strength to its progress No man
can estimate the consequences of failure in the
present effort to arrest it    The cusís is one of
momentous and fearful interest     The triumph
I of corruption now may be its enduring timmph,
! a triumph which may reach, in its consequences,
far beyond the time when Afiican slavery shall
I have been exterminated—as I pray Heaven it
may soon be—from this and eveiy other land
That slavery I abhor and detest, and shall do
¡what I lightfully can to root it out from the
j world, but I also detest and abhor the slavery in
which the policy of this Administration has long
j sought to bind the fieemen of this country, and
I intend to do what I can to take away the power
of the oppressor, so that the oppressed may go
l free     In both cases I am for emancipation with-
i out delay     In one, I do not expect to see it ac-
complished immediately, in the other, I hope to
see it effected on the 4th of March, 1841    Neither
of these causes do I intend to forget in my zeal
for the other  The sword of justice is two-edged,
and both the " curse of slavery" and the " cor-
ruptions of Van Burenism" may be made to feel
its power
THE PEOPLE TIRED OF DISCUSSION
I have, Mr Chan man, listened to the recent
debate m this committee with some attention, and
have heaid some things which sounded to me
veiy strangely On entering this Hall two days
aaro, I found a gentleman from Maryland [Mr
Howard] replying to the arguments which had
been urged against this Administration, and pro-
fessing to defend it on its arraignment for conup-
tion and a"ouse of power And what did I h<ar
from him' Why, sir, instead of a serious de-
fense, theie met my ear a most mournful eom-
plamtof waste of time m this discussion ' Instead
of an aigument, we were giavely and repro\ingly
told that " the peonle were dissatisfied with us as
a debating society " Yes, sn, standing in the
high position of chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Affurs—a position fiom which he might
well be supposed to speak the sentiments of the
Administration—the gentleman deems it sufficient
to meet the indignant remonstrances of the peo
pic, thiough their Repiesentatives, against the
newly developed results of Executive favoutism
and corruption, by telling us that we are a mere
debating society, with whose harangues our con-
stituents are weaned' We aie actually gowned
by the gentleman and sent back to college, and
held up as a class of sophomores, exercising our
wits and sharpening our faculties by inti lltctual
conflict This is deemed by the honorable chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs as a
sufficient answer to the arguments of opposition
on this flooi, and a fitting defense of the Admin
istration against the heavy artillery dlawn up to
batter down its foi tifications and level the walls
of its last citadel
The people dissatisfied with us as a debating
society ' Sir, so far from this being true, the
people are looking from every quarter with the
most intense anxiety to our deliberations, and to
the investigations we have instituted into the
abuses of Executive power Manv a man among
the honest, unsophisticated yeomanry of the
country, who has long held on to the Adminis-
tration, under the hope of reform, which was art
fully held out at the beginning of its deceptive
career, is beginning to open his eyes upon the
alarmi ne results of -pledges 6) okenand power abused
" Give us light," is the cry that comes up to us
from every quarter of the Union " Send us
speeches and reports of committees We want
to see the results of the promised ' reform,' and
possess the means of judging of the conduct of
those who have ruled over us for the last ten
years " Such is the language addressed to me
by many of my constituents, and it is, I have no
doubt, addressed to almost every member on this
floor who is known to be unpledged to sustain,
right or wrong, the men in power And, sir,
[ these inquines have not been prompted by any
art ñni\ excitement, got up to suuserve t! c pi r-
poses o<" paity, but they have been forced from
|! the i eople by the practic 1 results of the Cxem
1 live i uLcy—results wh th no arts could conceal—
results which hate been the legit mate fruit op
sed long since sown, and which would produce
its kind The Administration have sown tne wind
and are now reaping the whirlwind.
Mr Chairman, I commend the prudence of the
gentleman fiom Maryland He has made the
best defense of the Administration that could be
made We are " a debating society'" and the
people are sick of it' Thi<s is his answer to the
murmurs of the people, and the arguments of the
people's repiesentatives This is the language
which is used to Congress and the country when,
after a maladministiation of ten years, which has
brought us to the foot of Executive power, there
is a roused and struggling effort to shake off the
incubus, restore the Constitution to its just bal-
ance, Congress to its lights, and the people to
their full and fiee breathing
Mr Chairman, the gentleman mistakes the
feelings of himself and his political associates
here for the feelings of the people, when he sup-
poses they are tired of discussion. Sir, the peo-
ple want discussion They pray for light. They
say, debate—debate fully and thoroughly. We
will pay the expense. Goon Probe matters to
the bottom Don't spare for their crymg We
begin to find out that the boasting reformers have
deceived and misled us, and we want to see fur-
ther into the mystery of their political iniquity
Open thp doors wide, if you can get the keys, and
if you cannot, keep thundering at them till we can
come to your aid with a reinforcement
Tired of discussion ' Well may this JMminis-
tration be tned of it It is a battering ram that
is shaking the walls of their castle, and threaten-
ing to bury them in its ruins Light and tiuth '
What horror takes hold of the abuséis of power,
when these stern and vigorous assailants look
them full in the face—when quickened memory
brings up with fearful celerity, and presents in
diead array, their political transgressions, and
" conscience, which makes cowards of us all,"
performs his office Well may they cry out in
the subdued agony of detected guilt, we are tned
of discussion But, sir, the people aie not tned
of it They are aioused, and discussion will go
on If we hold our peace, they will not be silent
If we refuse to come to the rescue, then shall en
laigement and deliverance arise from some other
quarter     " Truth is mighty, and will prevail "
Rut suffer me, Mr Chan man, to look a little
moie narrowly into the reasons why the friends
of the Administration are tired of discussion It
is ten years since the present dynasty came into
power Those who are now so impatient of dis-
cussion have good memories. They have not
forgotten with what professions they forced their
way to the chief control The means employed
by them to supplant the preceding Administra-
tion have become matter of h istory The pledges
made to a deceived people are on record, and the
gross and shameless violations of them now stare
their authors full in the face And, sir, it shall
not be my fault if they are not made to look
upon them until their eyeballs shall be scared with
the sight
THREAT  TO PUT   DOWN  THE   " PORE  ADMINISTRA-
TION "
f well remember the history of the cam ass
which elevated General Jackson to the Presiden-
cy í saw then, as clearly as I see now, and
detested then, as strongly as I detest now, the
means by which that elevation was effected And
I now say, without the fear of contradiction, that
a grosser system of deception was never piac-
ticed upon any people than that by which the
purest Administration the country ever had was
supplanted, and the most corrupt put in its place
Who, Mr Chairman, can fail to remember the
declaration of a leading partisan of General Jack-
son, now the second officer m the Government,
made at the outset of Mr Adams 'a administration,
that "it should be put down, though pure as the
angels at the right hand of the throne of God 1" And
how was a pure Administration to be put down *
The ingenuity of disappointed ambition was itady
with an answei, rai«e the ciy of " bargain and
juupnnn," because a man who voted in the
House jf Represe n'at ves tor the elected Fre^i
dent has oeen «elec ed as one of his confdential
adviser  Let " bargain and corruption" be ste-
r ot/ped, ind placed at the head of every JJppo^
sition newspaper for four years *
It was done ' The columns of the United States
Telegraph, and of all the affiliated journals of the
