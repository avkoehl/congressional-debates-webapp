C. S. Army, the officers and men of this army are to bind themselves not to take up arms against the United States until properly relieved from that obligation, and shall receive guarantees from the U. S. officers against molestation by the U. S. authorities so long as they observe that obligation and the laws in force where they reside. For these objects duplicate muster-rolls will be made immediately, and after the distribution of the necessary papers the troops will march under their officers to their respective States, and there be disbanded, all retaining personal property. The object of this convention is pacification to the extent of the authority of the commanders who made it. Events in Virginia, which broke every hope of success by war, imposed on its general the duty of sparing the blood of this gallant army and saving our country from further devastation and our people from ruin.
