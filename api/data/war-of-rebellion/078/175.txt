the Mud Lick to McCormick's Gap, and back to Camp White. Passing from Mud Lick Springs to McCormick's Gap, in charge of twenty- one men, I was fired on by four or six rebels, and had 1 man slightly wounded. I sent a scout of forty men, yesterday evening at 4 o'clock, to Gill's Mills, with directions to send across to McCormick's, scour the country, and report this evening. I will send out a scout to- night in that direction, and one in the direction of Owingsville. I learn nothing here to occasion any alarm. I will report any important information promptly.
