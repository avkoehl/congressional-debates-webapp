respect, all regretting that he is not now in the field. I desire to suggest that if General McClernand, with some Western troops, was put in command of Pennsylvania, it would inspire great hope and confidence in the Northwest, and perhaps throughout the country.

RICH'D YATES,

Governor.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., August 24, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

On June 27, ultimo, I had the honor to address you a respectful communication, giving the circumstances attending my removal by General Grant from the command of the Thirteenth Army Corps, and containing, among other things, the following passages:

I ask, in justice, for an investigation of General Grant's and my conduct as officers from the battle of Belmont to the assault of May 22 on Vicksburg, inclusive.

* * * * * * *

Please early advise me of the determination of the Government in the premises.

Fearing that the foregoing matter, in the multitude of your engagements, has escaped your attention, I write again, respectfully asking that you will please immediately advise me whether the desired investigation will or will not be ordered.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McClernand,

Major-General.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., September 5, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 29th ultimo. * By it I am advised that the President has declined to order a court of inquiry. If the reason for this determination was because my application contemplated an investigation extending beyond my own official conduct, I beg to obviate the objection by requesting a court of inquiry simply to investigate my own conduct. If the court be granted, I would prefer that its jurisdiction be extended to my entire conduct as an United States officer in the present war; or, if that may not be, to my conduct in connection with the Mississippi River expedition; or, if that may not be, to my conduct in connection with the late campaign from Milliken's Bend around to Vicksburg, and resulting in the fall of that place.

Pardon this further intrusion upon you attention, which is made in no improper spirit, but to ascertain the intended effect of the President's determination, and to ask of you to further oblige me by early advising me in the premises.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McClernand,

Major-General.
