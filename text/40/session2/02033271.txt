river and harbor bill.
Mr. EGGLESTON. When the bill now
before the House is disposed of, the river and
harbor bill will come up. It has been sug-
gested by my colleagues on the Committee on
Commerce, and by those who are opposed to
some portions of the bill, that we should fix on
Tuesday next, or some day early next week, for
final action on that bill, as some of those inter-
ested in its discussion wish to leave the city
to-night. I therefore suggest to my colleague
on the committee, [Mr. Eliot,] who has the
bill in charge, that he make a motion to post-
pone, if he sees fit to do so.
Mr. ELIOT. From the best information I
can obtain I think the probability is that we
shall have the tax bill upon ua before it would
be possible to mature the river and harbor bill,
and by the rule of the House itwill then become
necessary for us to enter on the consideration
of that bill. I do not object to the suggestion
made by my colleague on the committee to
postpone the river and harbor bill until Tues-
day next, with the understanding that it shall
be considered immediately after the tax bill is
disposed of.
Mr. SPALDING. That will not do. There
are other bills waiting to come in. I object.
Subsequently Mr. Spalding withdrew his
objection, and the bill (H. R. No. 1046) mak-
ing appropriations for the repair, preservation,
and completion of certain public works, and
for other purposes, was postponed until lues-
day next after the morning hour.
immigrant ships.
The House resumed the consideration of the
bill (II. R. No. 1100) to amend an act entitled
"An act to regulate the carriage of passen-
gers in steamships and other vessels, ana tor
other purposes.'
