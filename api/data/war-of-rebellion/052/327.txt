Palmer is at Battle Creek with one brigade, but cannot ge the ferry from Brannan before morning. Wood crossed one brigade last night at Shellmound and will cross the other to-day. Van Cleve is here; he thinks his train from McMinnville will be up to-morrow, as he has heard from it since it left. I shall lose no time whatever in crossing and shall endeavor to take up position on other side, as per order, on time.
