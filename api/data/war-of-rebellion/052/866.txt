VICKSBURG, MISS., September 26, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

You can turn over the command of that part of your corps that will be left to General McPherson, and have them so posted as to cover the country between the Yazoo, as it is now covered by you.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNumbers A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

VICKSBURG, MISS., September 26, 1863.

General SHERMAN:

I am told that there is a small camp of rebel cavalry near Benton, committing depredations. Have you got 300 or 400 fresh cavalry to send in there rapidly, to try and pick them up. I think they should start in the afternoon and travel at night so as to come upon them early in the morning. They might then go down to Yazoo City and return by way of Satartia.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 26, 1863.

General GRANT, Vicksburg:

I have the cavalry and can send it out. The cavalry back of Yazoo City is not in camp. Their camp is near Vernon, east of Black River, and they are engaged in getting cattle from the Yazoo. I doubt if we can catch them, but I will try to-morrow afternoon.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, Vicksburg, Miss., September 26, 1863.

General SHERMAN:

I was not aware that Vernon was the headquarters of a cavalry division. You may send a brigade of infantry, as you proposed, or as much of it as you deem necessary and all the cavalry that can be spared, and see if we cannot break up their present cavalry arrangements. The rebels have at present a small force over on Silver Creek collecting cattle and negroes and burning cotton. They might be intercepted and their stock taken from them by going down to Yazoo City and return in by the river route. You have studied the geography of the route to be traversed more than I have and can give the specific directions.

U. S. GRANT,Major-General.
