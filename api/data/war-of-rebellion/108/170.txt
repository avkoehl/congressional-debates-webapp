LUNEY'S CREEK, July 14, 1861.

THOMAS MOSLIN, Esq.:

DEAR SIR: I herewith send a dispatch from Colonel Johnson of the Northwest Army. The messenger states that they want all the troops that can be had. You will see from the dispatch that our men have been routed by the enemy. General Garnett and Colonel Heck are coming through the mountains by way of Tucker County and via Greenland here. They wish some troops sent to pilot them through the mountain. The Northern troops are making their way over the Staunton and Parkersburg road to Staunton. Eight thousand strong now at Huttonsville. General Garnett wants to get through to Monterey with all the additional troops that can be had to stop them at Monterey.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. J. McNEMA.

You had better send a dispatch to Colonel McDonald immediately for as many men as can be had.

General GARNETT:

I shall effect a junction with Colonel Scott about 1 p. m. to-day. He has retreated to Greenbrier River at the foot of this mountain. The enemy can get in my rear by Huntersville and Monterey, and by Pendleton to Herron's.

E. JOHNSON,

Colonel Georgia Regiment.

Written on note of W. C. Scott, of which we can read part, as follows: Please hasten on by forced marches or the enemy may be too hard for me single handed.

W. C. SCOTT,

Colonel of Forty-fourth Regiment Virginia Volunteers.

[Indorsed.]

Hand this to General Garnett.
