Major-General STEEDMAN:

Yours just received. Thanks for your prompt assistance. What kind of men are the 600? Can they move together, or are they detachments? There are constant rumors that the enemy are in force, but cannot yet obtain anything definite.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE ETOWAH,Chattanooga, November 17, 1864.

Colonel CULVER,

Dalton, Ga.:

Do you credit the report that the enemy is in any considerable force near Resaca? Give your own opinion from the information you get that is reliable. Do not permit the troops at the terminus of the road to get nervous over vague rumors.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

DALTON, November 17, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Commanding District of the Etowah:

GENERAL: I do not believe that there is any considerable force of the enemy at Resaca. I have sent a staff officer down to ascertain particulars. Lieutenant-Colonel Poteet, One hundred and fifteenth Illinois, near Resaca, says he had reliable information this morning that the enemy were crossing in force at Fite's Ferry, and wants me to send him some cavalry. I have only ten or twelve horses in the command; had to press some for the scouts this morning. I ought to move a mounted force of 50 or 100 men to scout the country.

J. B. CULVER,

Colonel, Commanding.
