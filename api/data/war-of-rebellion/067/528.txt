could assume an upright posture without seriously endangering his life. It was determined to try the effect of the mortar shells upon them and the whole battery delivered its fire, with the same charge of powder and length of fuse as at first. The result was almost instantaneous. Their firing was suppressed and was not resumed for several hours. It is perhaps not improper to observe that, during this affair, 2 rebels were seen to be blown 10 feet into the air, with heads detached. Their companions wildly scattered in every direction, and our infantry (General Owe's brigade) giving a cheer, delivered a volley with telling effect. At dark the enemy opened a heavy fire of artillery and musketry, which was replied to by our infantry, artillery, and the mortars. Of course the execution done by the last could not be seen. The attack was discontinued at the expiration of half an hour. The battery remained in this position night an day until the evening of the 10th of June. During this time but little firing was done, the battery being short of ammunition.

It was observed that the enemy had fallen back in front of the mortars, leaving but a few skirmishers and sharpshooters in their front line of breast-works. In the mean time the rebels fired at our forces with good range, using what was supposed to be a 24-pounder howitzer, trained as a mortar. The projectile thrown was spherical case-shot, by the explosion of one of which a man and a mortar were struck, but no serious damage was done to either. A new supply of ammunition having been received, it was decided to silence the rebel machine, if possible. By observing the smoke of their discharges, it was estimated that the distance was about 800 yards. A charge of 6 ounces of powder and a 15-second fuse were used, and after about one dozen discharges the enemy's machine was silenced.

On the evening of the 10th two sections of the battery were withdrawn. On the 11th the remaining section, in charge of Captain Jones and Lieutenant Moore, was employed in firing at a rebel battery of light 12-pounder, which had opened upon a Union battery a short distance to our left. The mortars were estimated to be about 800 yards from the rebel battery. The charge was 5 1/2 ounces and the length of fuse 15 seconds. The first shot struck on the left of the battery on a sand-bag breast-work, tearing a large hole therein. Another exploded inside the parapet, another in rear of the battery, another a short distance to the right. Assisted by the Union battery (light 12-pounders), the enemy's guns were silenced. After this a few shells were thrown into a house almost in front of the mortars and 300 yards distant. The charge was 3 1/2 ounces and the fuse 10 seconds in length. The house was a refuge for sharpshooters. One shell broke through the roof and exploded in the house. No more shots were observed to come from that locality. The two sections that were withdrawn took position about half a mile to the right and 200 yards from the rebel lines.

On the 11th only 7 rounds were fired from these sections, which had the usual effect on the rebel sharpshooters. None of the enemy's artillery responded.*
