POINT OF ROCKS, MD., August 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding:

A scouting party of twenty-four men started yesterday to Loudoun County, crossing the river at Point of Rocks ford; from there went to Waterford, thence to Wheatland and Southerville, Va., and Short Hill Mountain; returned this morning, having seen or heard of no rebels except a few straggling guerrillas. I hear from reliable authority that up to noon of the 23rd there was no force east of Blue Ridge. Another scout is out.

Do you know anything of him? The railroad is destroyed pretty effectually near Kearneysville. You
