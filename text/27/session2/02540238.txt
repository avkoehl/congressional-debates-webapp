were express appropriation bills or not The act of 183? ap-
propriated $40,000, ami the next act of January, 1839, appro-
priated $43,400, By leference to the estimates of that act they
would rind that two additional clerks worepioposed, accounting
for this additional appropriation. Tins was unquestionably a
specific aijd express appropriation, and they eouul include it in
thisiappropnation bill without violating any principle whatever.
He wished to inquire of the gentleman who introduced these
resolutions [Mr. ¡Summers] what salary he proposed lor the as-
sistant postmaster of ihisHouse. Iiecouldnut ascertain from
the report made.
Mr. ¡SUMMERS said that, so for as the examination of the
committee had enabled them to asee run n,there was aow no such
officer known as the assistant postmaster to this ilmise The
gentleman who performed this duty, and might be entitle! to
the name, was a messenger, and a messergei only. lie, like
all the other messengers, till ¡March, 1639, had leceivcd $'2
per day. Then his sataiy was raised to $3 per day, And on the
next day that of the other messengais wa-i laised to ©2 50.
The committee, in their report, recomirtemh-d i hat the sa
lanes of ad the messengers of the Rouse should b°> %Z 50
per day. ThecomimtteeT and, if the labors oí tka". individual
were more onerous than of the other messengers, let him he
put on an annual salary. Ho knew of nothing that ought to
entitle him toa larger salary than the ether messengers of the
House.                                                                                          •
Mr. WISE said that he knew, and all the members of the
House could ascertain the fact, that tins was 3 much more
important officer ¡ban the other messengers of this House
He was responsible fir bringing from t be city post office the
mail of this ÍÍOuse, the importance of whictt they all knew.
He was also shut up with the postmaster at the- opening oí the
mail.
Mr. FILLMORE said he hoped tb's question would not he
discussed outof order, hut tiiat the debate would be confined to
the resolution be tore them.
Mr. WIc*E did not mean to enter into the general discussion,
but would say that the duties of this officer woie highly oneioiis,
and of an lmp-marituuMt. JL. was em pío ved ¡iom 8 o'clark m

sufficient support for the man—certainly not asuffictnt com-

Mr. BRIGGrt thought ¡he gontleman from Vngim-i [Mr.

The question the ^ is, how should th?y b.-1 b ealieed "i A
pe&tion of the clsiic existed undei an act óí Consre*s, and ano-
ther portion under the resolutions ofiheTiousc. Xf an addi-
tional number wet e legalized by a resolution, he would inquire
of the chairman of the'Commutee of Ways and Means if there
was any doubt in regard to the fact whether a resolution
would sufficiently legalize them"?
Mr. FILLMORE said he would very cheerfully give his own
opinion on this question if the gentleman desired it. lie did
notse3any necessary connection between the power to fill a
vacancy and the creating power to make it, except so far as re-
cognised by the Constitution. If the point was, whether the
Committee of Ways and Means deemed the creation of an offi-
cer by a resolution such a creation as authorized them to ap-
proptiate for it, th; gentleman would perceive by the proviso
to the very ¡t-uaiuii oi theappiopztatkm bdl they were now con
sidering in Committee of (he Whole, tiiat the Committee of
Ways and Means had provided thit, wherever either House, by
resolution, should employ a cteik or other officer, the appro*
priatiations should cover loa salary, bull they did not consider
that a resolution was a law withmthe in anuig oí theruie.
Mr. CUSUÍNG, If the House adopt this r^ohinon, the ap-
propriation bill can be so wunhd asrto tov&r the salar.es of
these two H^rlr0-?
Mr.Firr/vIOKE.   It does already.
Mr. OUSJIiNG said if they adopted this íesoboion, the
question of order now p^ndins; before the cortmMttef of the
Whole mi^ht be disposed of. For thw purpose, as he was
anxmusthat the Hon^-e should decide ¡his question this morn-
ing, he would call the previous question.

A BILL to puppend, for n limited time, the oper.itinn of a paif of
an art eviritlnd, "An ¿rt  ¡o re/tve auA p\;e'id the charters of
cr^u-n n?iik*m th" D:-:nr' of Columbii '•
Maryland paper. The banks were now willing to receive that
paper, provided Congress would allow them to do so, and to
pay i: out asam to those who were willing fo take it. But if
Congress refused to the hanks the liberty to receive it, ofcourse
the people o. the District could not pay it, and they would be
requned by the banks lo pay in specie. The off ct of refusing
to pass this bill would be, that the whole amount due by the'
people of tli3 District to the banks would be converted mto a
specie demand, and that, too, when the banks were willing to be
paid in Virginia or Maryland paper if Congress was willing
that they should pay it out. And that was the simple question
presented to the consideration of the House, The case, it
seemed to him, was aveiy plain orte.
One other fact he wished to sta'e, and then, he thought, the
House would have every thing belore it which it was requisite
to enable the members to voteundevstanclmgly on the. question.
The amount which the. people of the District owed to the
banks was something like two millions of dolíais. He had not,
in view of this present quesiion, examined the reports made at
the extra session, and he spoke from general recollection; and,
according to that, the amount was something like two millions.
If. then. Congress refused to allow payment m Vil-gima and
Maryland notes, it would convent the debt of the people to the
banks into a specie demand of something like two millions of
dollars. Now, when such an intimate connection existed be-
tween the people of this District and the people of the ritates of
Virginia and Maryland, when the currency of the two States^by
which the people of the Dis'nctwere surrounded constituted a
hrge poitionoi the cucuUting medium, would Congress thus
convert this amount of liabilities into a specie demand, and say
that these debts mutt be collected in specie'? It appeared to
him ihatthe&malJ boon provided by this bill should not be de*
ni.-d.
And then, m obedience to a very geneial voice therefor, Mr.
U. demanded the pieviou^qups'nm
