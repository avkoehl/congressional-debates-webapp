Colonel, Commanding.

OCTOBER 2, 1862.

Major-General THOMAS, Floyd's Fork, Bardstown Road:

I am absolutely compelled to go on to Taylorsville. There is no water in Plum or Elk Creek for man or beast. I fear I am about 5 miles out of position, but it cannot be helped. The force at Shelbyville must have gone to Frankfort. They belonged to Smith. Send me orders to Taylorsville. Have driven the enemy's vedettes to-day.

A. McD. McCOOK.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 2, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

My latest information is that Smith's and Buckner's forces are concentrating at Danville to re-enforce Bragg. Their artillery left Lexington several days ago. I have reason to believe that our General Morgan has escaped through West Liberty in the direction of the Ohio River. Please give me any information you may get relative to enemy's movements north of the Kentucky River, as it will enable me to judge of the best point for the concentration of new troops coming in.

Very respectfully, yours,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Washington, October 2, 1862-11.5 a.m.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Communicate with the Governor of States in your department and hurry forward regiments. This delay is ruinous. One regiment now is worth what ten will be a few weeks hence. Milroy's brigade left here several days ago.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 2, 1862.

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio; Governor MORTON, Indianapolis, Ind.;

Governor YATES, Springfield, Ill.; Governor BLAIR, Detroit, Mich.:

It is of the utmost importance that the new regiments be got ready for the field with the greatest expedition. Delay is ruinous. One regiment now is worth more than many would be a few weeks hence. Let me urge upon you the necessity of giving this prompt attention. Please inform me at once how fast regiments may be expected from your State, in order that they may be disposed of to the best advantage.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
