HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Warrensburg, February 15, 1865.

Respectfully forwarded to major-general commanding Department of the Missouri for information. The constant employment of the troops on other duty has prevented us from employing many of them on these works. I have ordered the citizens impressed into service and will compel them to work. The great scarcity of timber in vicinity of Warrensburg is an obstacle in the way of constructing the block-house at this point. This will be speedily overcome and the work progress.
