tion. Following out practically the principles of theConstitu
lion, he would increase the number of Representatives, and
thereby increase the difficulty of corruption m times when cor
ruption was too prevalent throughout the land
Mr POPE said he had once been in favor of a diminished
fcamber of Representatives, as a means of avoiding the confu
sionand delay which nowtoomuch prevai'ed, but, on further re-
flection, and aftei more experience, he had come tu ffce belief
that, for the preservation of liberty, the larger 'he number ol
Representatives of the peuple the better He referred, m sup
port of a numerous delegation, to the course of Cieneial Wa«h
ington, who had proposed, in convention, to make the íes nc
tion in the Consti uaon as low as ¿0 000 It was the opmion of
many of the greatest of the Virgun i statesmen, that, as you in
creased the number oftliepeop e'sRepres ntativesm the Legi«
lature, you increased the actual power of the people Mr P.
advocated a compaiatively amali Congressional district, as bet
ter enabling the Representative to have a personal acquam'ance
withhisconstituents, and rendering him moie independent of
the misrepresentation  of a parly pies* It would be haider to
prostrate an honest man m a smaller than in a very large dis
tnct The power of wealth, too, would be less felt He
believed a House wifh five hundred members would preserve
more order in its proceedings, and would have a smaller num
bei of debaters than one of the present size
Mr DAVIS, of New York, very warmly opposed the num
ber now under consideration, and contended for a small aver
age and a numerous Hou=e of the people As to the objection
from increased expenso, he hada ready mode oí meeting that
which was, to reduce the per diem of members to &4, and abo!
ish their franking privilege He avowed it as his earnest de-
sire to get more of the people into the House, and fevvergen
tlemen He rpcogmsed no such class in the communit), he
wanted to see the haid handed mechanics and farmeisen that
floor. He, too, believed a House of five hundred members
would be more ordeily, and would do business moie expedí
tiously The necessity of each man's making a spee< h to satis
fy the expectation oí his constituents wou'd in such a House,
be superseded, the members would be acting:, voting men, not
talking men Mr D wanted to cbanae the toneofmanncisand
feelings in this metropolis He lelt himself a srars^r here,
and wanted an atmosphere around him moie congemai to tho^e
he repre ented The House ought to be a living, acting emana
tion from the people, and should be composed of manuals of
the same sort wit i them He woull gladly see its numbers
doubled As it was now, be nevei had seen rnoie d^oider and
less decorum and efficiency in any legislative body

Gentlemen seemed to have had the British House of Com
mons before their eyes, just as if that were a representation of
the peop'e of EnglantT It was no such thing, it was a repre
sentation of the Ministry in power, or soon to come into power
The members a large majority of them, were absent mo°t of
the time, and were sent ior when their votes were wanted
This was the natural jesult of a very numerous legislative body,
A House so constituted would necessarily throw the whole pow
er of the Government into the hands of the Senate and the Ex
ecutive. In tbe last war, the House had contained a little over
a hundred member", and even then, it had at one time sat three
weeks, without a ^ce**, before it could get a question Had
it consisted of thieehundrtd men, what would hive become of
the countiy? The Capitol might have been batteied down
befois the II mse of Keprescntatives could have voted a man
oi a dollar to defend it As to the argument for i educing the
pay of member , it was an argument to ihe aristocracy—its
tendency was to fill the House only with them, pool men could
not afford to come heie If the gentleman was so anxuus to
see bu chers and bakers in the House, he took the wrong course
to bung them into it V\ by, a man could not, as it was, hear
the expense of a foreign mission unless he had a fortune, and
si it wou d be m this Hou^e, unless he was willing to break
himself, bieak his friends, and ruin his wife and ch ldren Be
sides, the Constitution lequned one half the total number of the
House to constitute a iiuorum, (in the Hon^e of Commons forty
men were sufficien ,)and how much of the time had the present
lit use contained ovei one hundred and sixty members1 What
would a House d > with double its number? There would be an
eternal call of tbe House, and each call would consume horns
