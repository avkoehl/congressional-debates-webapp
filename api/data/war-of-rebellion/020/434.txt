care of the extensive and important works at those which have been placed in his keeping. Whenever you can dispense with the service of Captain Duane or Lieutenant Suter I shall be glad to place the permanent works at Fernandina and other points within the Department of the South in their trust, unless, indeed, in the great urgency which presses upon me for want of engineer officers, some other point may have claims even more extreme than these shall then possess.

Respecting armament, it is beyond my power to do more than to bring the state of readiness of our works in this respect to the knowledge of the War Department and the Ordnance Office.

I am, &amp;c.,

JOS. G. YOTTEN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Colonel of Engineers.
