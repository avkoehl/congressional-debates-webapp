Sepaiatg the Government from ihe Banks—Mr. Calhoun.
Senate*
gravitation of the system has been m one
dnechon—to dispense with the «se of ihe metals, and
hence the descent from a bank of deposite to one of
discount, and hence, from being the representative,
their notes have become the substitute, for gold and
silver, and hence, finally, its present tendency to a
mere paper engine, totally separated from the
metals. One law has steadily governed the system
throughout—the enlargement of its profits and
influence, and under that operation, through
which metallic currency became insufficient
for circulation, it has become in us progress,
insufficient foi the basis of banking operations,
so much so, that, if specie payments were restored,
it would be but nominal, and the system would
in a few years, on the first adveise current,
sink down asraia mto its present helpless condition
Nothing can pre\ent it but great and radical
changts, which would diminish its profits and influ-
ence, so as_efieclually to arrest that strong and
deep current w hich has carried so much of the
wealth and capital of the community in that direc-
tion Without that, the system, as now constituted,
must fall, unless, indeed, it can iorm an alhante
with the Government, and through it establish its
authority by law, and make its credit, unconnected
w ith gold and silvei, the medium of circulation.
If the alliance should take place, one of the fir t
motemente would be the e tabhshmenl of a great
central! nstitution,or,if that should prove impractica-
ble a combination of a few selected and powerful
of the Slate banl s, w hich, sustained by theGovern-
m°tit, would ciush or subject the weaker, to be
followed bv an amendment of the Constitution, or
some other device, t-> limit their number and the
amount of capital hereafter This done (he next
step would be to confine and consol díte the supie-
maoj of the system ovei the currency of the
coi ritij, winch would be m ils hands exclusively,
and, thtough it, over the industry, business, and
politics of the country, all of 'which would be
wielded to advance its profits and power
Tne system having now arrived at this point, the
great and solemn duty devolves on us to determine
this i sy what relation this Government shall here-
after o^at to it Shall we enter into an alliance
with n, and become the sharers of its fortune and
the instrument of its aggrandizement and supre-
macy This is the momentous question, on vvnich
we must now decide Before we d-eide, it be-
hoves us to inquire whether the svst«rn is fav< n' 'e
to the permanency of our free republican institu-
tions to the industry and business of the country,
and, above all, to our moral and intellectual deve-
lopment, the great object for which we were placed
here by the Author of our being Can it be
doubted what must be the effects of a system whose
operations have been shown to be so unequal on
free institutions whose foundation rests on an
equality of rights1 Can that favor equality
/which gives to one portion of the citizens and the
countiy such decided advantages over the other, as
I have shown it does in my opening remarks1
Cm that be favorable to liberty which concentrates
the money powei, and placas it under the control
of a few powerful and wealthy individuals1 It is
the retnaik of a profound statesman, tha1 the reve
nue is the State, and, of course, those who control
the revenue control tne State, and those who can
control ihe money poner can the levenue, and
through it the State, with the property and industrj
of the couniry, in all its ramifications Let us
pause for a moment, and reflect on the nature and
extent of this tremendo us power
The curre-cy ot a country is, to the community,
what the blood is to the human system It consti-
tutes a ..mallpait but it cnculates through every
poition, and is mdispensible to all the functions of
life The currency bears ev en i smaller propor-
tion to the aggregate capital of the community,
tnan what the blood does to the sol ds m the human
system What that portion is, has not been, and
perhaps can not be, act urately ascertained, as it is
probably subject to considerable variations It is
probably between twenty five and thirty-five to one
Í will assume it to be thirty to one With this
assumption, let us suppose a community whose
aggregate capital is $31,000,000, its currency would
be, by supposition, one million, and the residue
of its capital thirty millions This being assumed,
if the currency be mci eased or decreased, the other
portion of the cap tal remains the same, accord-
ing to the well kno vn laws of currency, pro-
pelty would rise or fill with the increase or de-
crease, that is if the currency be increased to two
millions, the aggregate value of property would
rise to si\ty millions, and, if the cui rency be i e-
duced to &500 000, it would be reduced to fifteen
millions With this law so v ell established, place
the money powei in the hands of single individua',
or a combinanon of individuals, and by expanding
or coutractirg the currency, they may raise or sink
prices at pleasure, and by purchasing when at the
greatest denression, and selling at the greatest eleva-
tion, may command the whole property and indus-
try of the community, and control its fiscal opera-
tions The banking system concentrates and places
this power m the hands of those who control it, and
its force increases just in propoilion as it dispen-.es
with a me a!Uc basis Never was an engine in-
vented Detter calculated to place the destiny of the
many in the hand  of the few, or less favorable to
that equality and independence, w hich lies at the
bot om of all free institutions
These views have a bearing not less decisive on
the nen inquiry—the effects of the svstcm on the
industry aid wealth of the countiy Whatever
may have been its effects in this respect m its early
stages, it is difficult to imagine any more mis-
chievous on all of the pursuits of life than the fre-
quent at d sudd-n expansions and contractions to
which it has now oecome so habitually subject,
that it ma} be cons dered its ordinal y condition
None but those in the secret know whit to do All
are piu mg and Uokmg out to ascertain wheth-
er in ffxpms ~>n or c infraction is text t> tillow,
and what will re its extent i id durat on and if,
perchance, an erroi 1 c conmute 1—if it expands
when a contraction is expected, or the reverse, the
most prudent may lose by the miscalculation the
fruits of a life of toil and care The effects are to
discourage industiy, and to conveit the whole com-
munity Into stock-jobbers and speculators The
evil is constantly on the increase, and must conti-
nue to increase just as the banking system becomes
more diseased till it shall become utterly intolerable
Bat its most fatal effects originate in its bear-
ing on the moral and intellectual development of
the communm The gieat principle of demand
aid supply gov^ii the moral and i itelle„tual
world no less than the business and commeictal
It a community be so organized as to cause a de-
mand for high mental attainments, they are sure to
plausible, without containing one panicle of rea-
be developed If its honor  and rewards are allot-
ted to pursuits that require their development by
creating a demand for intelligence, knowledge,
wisdom, justice, firmness courage, patnotism, and
the like, they are sure to be pioduced But, if al-
lotted to pursuits that require mfenor qualities,
the higher are sui" to decay and pensh I object
to the banking system, because it allots the honors
andiewardsof thecommunii), m a very undue
proportio i, to a pursuit the least of all others favor-
able to the development'of the higher r>ental qual-
ities, intellectual or moial, to the decay of the
learned profess ons, and the more noble puisuits of
sc enc=, literature, philosophy, and statesmanship
and the great and moie useful pursuits of business
and industry W th the v ast increase of its profits
and influence, it s si tduallv cc ncenlrating in itself
most of the prizes of life—wealtn, honor, and in-
fluence, to the c^e't dispaiagement and degiidation
of all the liberal and u eful and generous
pursuits ot society The rising genention can
not but feel its deadening influence The
youths who crowd om colleges, and behold
the raid to honor and dist nciion teimmatmg
in i banking house will feel ine spirit of emu-
lation decav within him, in I will no longer be
pressed foi ward by generous ardour to mount up
the rugged steep of science, as the load to honoi
and distinction, when, peichaps, the hiehest po nt
he could attain in w hat was once the most honora-
bl" and influential of ?11 the learned profes ions,
would be the place of attorney to a bank
Nearly four years since, on the Question of the
removal of the deposites, although I was opposed
to the removal, and in favor of their restoration,
because I believed it to be unconstitutional and
illegal, yet, foreseeing what was coming, and not
wishing there should be anv mistake as to my opi-
nion on the banking system,! stated here m my place
vhat that opinion was I declared that I had long
entertuned doubts, if doubts they might be called,
which were daily increasing, that the system made
the worst possible distribution of the wealth of the
community, and that it would ultimately be found
hostile to the further advancement of civilization
and liberty This declaration was not lightly
made, and I have now unfolded the grounds on
which they resied, and which subsequent events
and reflection have matmed into a settled convic-
tion
With all these consequences before ns, shall we
restore the broken connection1 shall we again
unite tne Government with the system1 And what
are the argumt nts opposed to these high and weighty
objections1 Instead of meeting them and denying
their truth, or opposing others of equal weight, a
rabble of objections (I can call them by no betfer
name) are urged against the separation, one cur-
íency for th" Government, and another for the
people, separation of the people from the Govern-
ment, taking care of the Government, and not the
peop'e, and a whole fiaternity of others of like
character When I fiist saw them advanced in
the columns of a newspaper, I could not but srmie,
m thinking how admirably they were suited to an
electioneering canvass They have a certain plausi-
bility about them, which makes them troublesome
to an opponent simply because they are merely
s m 1 I ttle expected to meet them m discussion
in this piaoe, b it since they hav e been gravely intro-
duced beie, respect for the place and company
exicls i pissm" i itice, to vhich of themselves
they die not at all enliticd I begin with that
v, hich ¡s first pushed forward, and seems to be most
relied on—one currencyafor the Government and
another for the people Is it meant that the Go-
vernment mu-.t take in payment of its debts, what*
ever the people tal e in payment of theirs1 If so, it
is a very broad pioposition and would lead to im-
portant consequences The people now lecsive
the not*s of non-specie pay mg banks Is it meant
that the Government should also receive them?
They receive in cl ange all sorts of paper, issued
bv we 1 now not whom Must the Government also
rtce ve them' Tntv receive the notes of banks
issuing notes unuer five, ten, and twenty dollars
Is it intended that the Government shall also per-
manently receive them1 They rece ve bill  of ex-
change Shall Government too receive them1 If not,
I ask the reason Is it because they are not suita-
ble for a sound, stable, and uniform currency1 The
reason is good, but what becomes of the principle,
that the Government ougSt to take whatever the
people take1 But, I go further Itis the duty of Go-
vernment to receive nothing m its dues, but which
it has the right to rendei unifoim and stable m its
v a ue We are by the Constituí on made the
guaid an of the money of the countrv For this
the right of coming and regulating the value of
coins wis given, and w e hav e no ris-ht whatever
to receive or treit any thing as monev, or the
equivalent of monev, the vilut of which wehave
no right to ie"nlate If this principle be true, and
it can not be contri verted, Iisk what righ' has Con-
gress to receive and t eat the notes of the State
banks as monev1 If the Suites have the light to
mcoip">rate banks, what risfht has Congress to re-
gulate tbrm or their issues' Show me the power
in the Constitution If then ht be admitted, what
aie its limitit ons ind how can the right of sub-
jecting them to a bankrupt Uw in that case be de-
n el' If one be idmitted, the cuVr follows as a
consequence ind vet those «no are most indignant
against the proposition of ubjeetmg the Stat  banks
t > a bankrupt law, are the most clamorous to re-
ceive toe r no c., ni t seeing that the one nvolves
