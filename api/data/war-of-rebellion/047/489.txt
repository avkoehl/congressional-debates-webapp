CHARLESTON, S. C., November 6, 1863-8.30 a. m.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President Confederate States:

(Care of Major-General Whiting, Wilmington, N. C.)

I visited Sumter last night. It is all right at present. Major Elliott and garrison are in fine spirits. No casualties in last forty-eight hours. Commanding officer of that important post should have more rank.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First Military District, Mount Pleasant, S. C.:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that in the event of an attempt on the part of the enemy at night to assail Fort Sumter, as on a former occasion, by a boat expedition, 200 men of your command shall be held in readiness nightly, to be thrown to the assistance of the garrison of that work, by row-boats. You will please make the necessary arrangements to secure celerity and certainly of movements.

It will be well to arrange with Major Elliott for some signal to be given by him. Another party, of equal strength, will be sent from Fort Johnson.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]
