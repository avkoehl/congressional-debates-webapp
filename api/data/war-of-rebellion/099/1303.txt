RICHMOND, VA., March 1, 1865.

Colonel JAMES PHELAN, Meridian, Miss.:

I received your fiendly letter of the 17th of January only about a week ago, and do not see that I can answer it more appropriatelly than by sending you the annexed copy of a paper which I had prepared for transmission to Congress. As it would, however, have been necessary to acompany it, if sent, with a protest against

any Congressional interference with the function exclusively executive of assigning officers to command, I determined to withold it rather than, nuder existing circumstances, to send it to Congress with such a protest as I should have feft bound to make. The paper will fully expain my views and position in the matter. I may add that since the accompanying paper was written General Lee has asked that General Johnston should be ordered to report to him for duty, and that I have complied with his wish in the hope that General Jognston's soldierly qualities may be made serviceable to his country when acting under General Lee's orders, and that in his new position those defects which I found manifested by him when serving as an independent commander will be remedied by the control of the general in-chief.

Very truly and respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

JEFF'N DAVIS.
