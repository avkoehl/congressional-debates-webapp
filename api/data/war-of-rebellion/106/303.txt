HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, February 4, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: We are experiencing extreme embarrassment throughout the whole department in consequence of the depreciation of U. S. Treasury notes. They are now worth less than 70 cents on the dollar, and our purchases and contracts have to be made conditionally. The money basis in this conuntry is specie. there is no paper currency in circulation except that of the Government. The greatest economy has been used in all the disbursing departments, but owing to the dispresed condition of the troops and the long lines of transportation over this widespread department our expenses are necessarily heavy; and again, the large expenditure for raising and eqipping the new regiments has to be met. Again, I beg leave to submit to the Department the hardship falling upon the officers and soldiers on this coast. Everything is enormously high, even when paid for in specie, and the notes can only be counvered at a ruinous discout. I would most earnestly recommend that the payments in all the departments on this coast be made as far as practicable in coin. The best interest of the Government will be the result. I beg of you to submit this communication to the consideration of the General-in-Chief, whose intimate acquaintance with affairs on this coast will enable him to judge of the propriety of my recommendations.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
