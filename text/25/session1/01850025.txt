25th Cohg.....1st Sess.                           Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. E'll.                                                       H. of Reps.
thit they would suggest nothing. It seemed to him
(Mr. A ) 'hat they were reduced to the dilemma of
either acknow ¡edging that they had no measure
which they could suggest, 01 that their favonte
measure is such that they shrink from presenting it
before the people.
We have, indeed, heard a cau non given to the
gentlemen of the opposition, not to bring forward
any proposition for a national bank, because such
a measure was odious to a majority of the people.
But, sir, thanks to the ftankne«s of the gentleman
fiom Kentucky (Mr Underwood) and the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, (Mr Biddle) there is no
longer any doubt or concealment upon this subject
The embarrassments of the country, which those
gentlemen represent m the most viv ñ colors, are all
ascribed to the destruction of the Uni'ed States
Bank, and the establishment of such an institution
is set forth as the panacea which is to restore every
thing to health, and bring back our former high and
palmy state of prosperity
The gentleman from Kentucky has asserted ilia*
the great canse of mischief was the veto of 1833,
occasioned by that clause in the Constitution which
makes the will of the President, m the exercise of
the veto power, paramount to the will of the tepre-
sentatives of the people Had it not been for this,
said the gentleman from Kentucky, we should now
have a national bank He (Mr A ) viewed the
matter differently The exercise of the veto power
in that instance by the Piesident, who, m tins re-
spect, acted as the agent of the people who elected
him, prevented the representatives from fastening,
by an accidental majority, an od'ous and irrespon-
sible moneyed ohgaiohy on the people, against
their w ill And in diat provision of the Co istitu-
tion he (Mr A ) saw a vise provision, which pre-
vented the "«ni of the people from bein<* thwnited
In acci lenta! oicumstances, and secured lo it, in
the en 1, its <ull lorce and effect
The issue is now fanly presented, and (said Mr.
A.) let it be proclaimed to the people of the country
that the true issue to be tried is, a Bank oí the
United States, er no bank The gentleman from
Pennsylvania had referred to the recent election in.
Mame in connection with the doctrines of the
Message, and had adveited to th?t election as
showing the rise of a "star in the East " The
doctrines of tke Message had beenieimed on this
flooi ¡evolutionary He thought that those doc-
trines were the doctunes really deceiving that
epithet, which would lead us to oveiturn 'he Con-
stitution and to do that wmch we have no consti-
tutional right to do He (Mi A) believed that
the doctrines of the Message were such as a vast
majority ol the people would approve, and that the
sentiments there avowed would find a hearty and
cordial response ¡n their bosoms It was just such
a message as was earnestly and ardently desired
and expected bj the people, and the President, in
sending forth that able and admirable document,
had done that without which no one can obtim
permanent greatness or renown—he has identified
himself with the spirit of the age.
There are gentlemen on this flooi, representing
the State ot Maine, abundantly able to speak in
her behalt, but he (Mi A ) knew a little of the
spirit ot the democracy ol theNoith, and he would
venture to say , that, let the true issue be piesented
to them, and the principles of the Message be w til
■neighed and understood, and they would rise and,
to a man, they would gird on their armor and ba-e
tnen blades, and, shoulder to «houldci, they would
again fight the battle of liberty And he coul I tell
the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania that, ere another
year, his "star m the Eist" will have pio\ed but
an ig'íis fatuus which has deceived htm with i
false and delusive hope, and 'he tiue star m the
East will re-appear—the star of the morning—the
harbmgei of full and glorious day
He hoped he might be pardoned bv the commit-
tee if he alluded bnefly to the imoutations which
have been made on the Secretary of the Tieasmy
That distinguished officer was a native of his (Mr
A's) native State, and of his native county One
imputation which has been thiown out is, that the
Secretary is opposed to the deposite law, < nd that
he has (if he, Mr A understood the charge)
thrown a large amount of money into the hands
of d sb using officers, s > that it c >u' 1 not be
available for the purpose of pi\mg the fourth
instalment If gentlemen wou'd take the trouble
to examine the information communicated by the
Secretary of the Treasury on the subjec, they
would discover the injustice of thi imputation in
the fact that the amount m the hands of disbursing
officers is less than t was m May last, the time of
the suspension of specie payments He would
also remark that the complaint which h?s beeii so
earnestly made concerning extravagant appropria-
tions, seems hardlv consistent with another source
of corophmt against that officer, who has also
been accused of taunting Congress with the fact
that then appropriations were larger than he had
recommended or could approve He thought that
some observations which have been made here in
relation to the Secietary might well have been
spared
Is there any secret cause of sensibility which
prompts these attacks on ihe pan of the friends of
the Bank of the United States'' Do they result from
the fact wMch is before the committee, in an an-
swer to the resolution of inquiry proposed by tha
gentleman trom Pennsylvania, (Mi Biddle,) that
ti e Secretan of the Treasury has paid large classes
ol public cieditors in gold and silver, while this fa-
voute Bank of the United States, m violation of
its charter and of the plainest moral obligations,
refuses to pay one single dol'ai1
That individual, said Mr A needed not the aid
of his humble vindication his distinguished career
is well known to the nation In his native State,
as an advocate, he had lew equals, and no supe-
nois at a bar, wmch for learning and talent is un-
surpassed by that of an\ State in the Union
Elevaied totne benon at a vol y early age, his lig-
miy, lmpiitidlity, aid l5uud legal attainments,
s eured (he respect of that uai, and the conn lence
of the su 'ors n hij court, a id h s published legal
opinions aie justly adm red foi their clearness of
conception, their coirect diction, and their piofound
learning Having filled the chair of Chief Execu-
tive Magistrate of his State, he was elected to the
Senate of the United States, and in tha* bodv,
amidst a constellation of talent never surpassed, he
stood in the ve y fust rank as a statesman and de-
bater, and in the administration of two departments
of this Government, and especially of the Treasury
Department m the late difficult crisis, his eminent
abilities, aided bv (hat wilhout which the gieatest
abilities aie ot litile avu1—Ins persevering ind
untuingmdus ry—have placed him ot an enviable
eminence in the eyes of the American people—an
eminence far above the reach of the shafts which
have been, or may be, aimed at him
HEM \RKS OF MR BELT ,
Op Temnessfe
In the House of Repiesentaiives, Tuesday, September
19,1837 —The House having lesumed, in Com-
mittee of tne Whole on the state of the Union,
theconsideiat on of the bill from the Señálelo
postpone the payment to the States of Ihe fourth
instalment of the deposites under the distribution
act of 1636
Mr BELL, of TuintsHc, said, that although
this v as one of a series of measures, the tendency
of which was to coiisummite an important and fa-
vorite policy o  the adnun stiitnn, or foi t'iat rea-
son might afoul any '-"nude of debate that might
be desirable to those who w shed to entei into the
discussion of an '•lie oi all those meas ires, yet he
should not a\ " ' himself of this 'lDeity He col -
sideied the que ti m duectly connected with the
measure pronosed in the oill undei cens delation of
Sieat impoiiince enough to engage his attenticn on
this occasion Again the other measuies to wh oh
he had alluded and which were proposed o go i-
nection with this one,?sdi(Terent paitso one irul tn=
same general system verc each ol them of weight
and interest enough to dem<ai i md receive a sepa-
rate diseuss v.n aid a sepaiate deteiimnarion of the
questions they mvol  ed
It eamiol be disguised, said Mi B that the bills
alieadv reported in this House,and whrh icceived
the  sanction  ot the Senate, whatever c utlemen
might profess, and whatever some of them ra.ght
perhaps very honestly thmk, wereso many features
of a project which found extensive countenance,
and the object of which was to establish, in fact, a
national bank—a Treasury bank of deposite and
issue. Disguise it as they may, such a plan has
been conceived, and not only conceived, but a"tu-
ally embodied to a consideraDle extent m the bills
which have been reported from a commitlee of this
House The plan is to establish a Government
bank undei the proper disguises for the present,and
through its agency to substitute a circulitmg me-
dium composed of Federal Government papel,
instead of the notes of State banks We have ue
germ of thi° bank now before us, its paits aie
already sufficien ly developed to indicate its true
character At another session, or in another Con-
gress, by one or another addition, by way of amend-
ment, we sha'I eventually behold the monster de-
veloped in all its frightful proportions Such a
subject is suiely of consequence enough by itself lo
occupy the attention of the House, without connec-
ting it with the less important subject under consi-
deration.                                            "
But the questions presented by this bill are of
great inteiest to the country It is true, the object
to be accomp'ished by U as less connection v< ith
the great resi.lts lo v inch I have alluded, than any
one of the othei measures proposed foi out adop-
tion, and I believe it wll be fo md, upon exanuna-
t on, to have originated more from the settled hos-
tility of the administration lo the policy of the de-
posite law of 1836, than from any actual necessity
of the Gov ernnif lit, or its tendency to promote the
fa\ onte fiscal policy of the Execuln e, but still it is
of a piece wui the geieial conduct end pohev of
those m power One question which v 11 be f mud
to anse under the present bi 1, uivo've^ the public
faith The question is piesentel, whether Con-
gress in (he Federal Croveniu en is net b n 1 to
keep Us promise, oi comply with its engagements
with the States of the Union, by obligation  as
strong as any that can exist between it and lis cre-
ditors, of any other nature or description It is a
question whethei, if the States agreed to accept the
deposite of the surplus in the Treasury, accordirg
to the terms of th" act of 1836, by which it was
tendered lo them, theie wasnot, from that momert,
a contract between them, as obligatoiy as anv othel
eoi'p^ct between the Government and the States
can be Can the General Go\e, nm^tit, without
consu ting th  other pwif  to'his n pngement,
dissolve it wilhout a breach of faith?
But, sir, theie is another and a much more ím-
piessive and important inquiry which presents it-
self in considering the effect of this bill—I mean
the great question whether the expenditures of tins
Government are to be reduced now or ever' This
is now the is ue, ind it is to be dcttimined abno t
exclusively by this House We alicidy know ti e
deteimmation of the Executive biaxh of the Gc>-
v eminent, ?nd all the influence attached to it, and
we know, too, the decision oí the other branch of
tne National Legislatnie It devo'ves upon this
House, I repeat, to se'tle the s^ue whe he- the e\-
perdituies of this Government, aftei hav ng been
inciciseü nearly threefold v jnm ihs last few
years, aie to be reduced now or °ver Tne e are
questions, truly, which may command mu evclj-
siv e at'ention for a season With these convic-
tions, and a eoiresponding de ei n i atuii 1 snail
proceed to make as succinct a state u< ut of w hat I
bebe\e to be the existing condi' on of th' Tuasmy
as I can, that it may be- seen wh thei the r pell of
the act of 1836, pioposed by the 1 ill undei con-
sideration, is demanded by h" state of the Tiel-
siuv or by the public inteiest, foi,if it be so, I
shs'l le piepared to give it my support
