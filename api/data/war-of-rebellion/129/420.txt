decisions to which you refer, I feel confident you will find nothing in those decisions to justify such a practice in morals.

Though I do find in the decisions quoted in your letter that our supreme court holds that "the enrollment (by the Confederate Government) of the officers and agents by whom the State governments are operated, and without whose agency their machinery must stop," would be violative of the very existence of the State government, and hence void; yet you can not fail to observe the strict conformity of the act of Congress to the doctrine of our supreme court, for that act in terms exempts all officers necessary for the proper administration of the State government; but neither Congress nor our supreme court, nor anybody else but Your Excellency, ever conceived the idea that justices of the peace who never held a court, constables who never served a warrant, and militia officers who have no men to command were necessary for the proper administration of the State government, "without whose agency the machinery must stop. "

Will even Your Excellency on calm reflection assert and certify that in any county in Georgia of the peace and an equal number of constables are necessary for the proper administration of the State government, and that "without their agency you have serious apprehensions the machinery of the State government must stop. " It does seem to me your fears and apprehensions might be quieted, especially in those districts which have had no justices or constables for several years preceding the time when the present incumbents sought and obtained those offices to keep out of the Army.

You seem to think that there is ample justification for withholding these men from the field, and protecting them in their "official retreats," in the fact that there are "Confederate officers, agents, and detailed men, who as the favorites of power have obtained safe and comfortable positions in the rear, while their less favored comrades who seldom get furloughs or details are required to meet the enemy in front. " Granting the truth and justice of this imputation upon the Confederate officers and men on duty in the rear, instead of inducing you to withhold still others from the field, if you are the friend you profess to be of our gallant soldiers in the front, it should have stimulated your efforts to fill up their decimated ranks and strengthen their efficiency. It will be hard to convince those true and brave men that you were befriending them in the hours of their greatest trails by keeping out of the Army justices of the peace who have not a case upon their docket, constables who never saw a warrant, and militia officers whose whole duty consists in drilling themselves. It may be that there are Confederate officers and men int he rear who are more needed in front, and who are engaged, as you allege, in attending to their private interests and the disgraceful practice of speculation. You know that such is not the case with all of these officers, and that some of them at least occupy their present positions not at their own suggestion, but in obedience to the orders of those who have the right to assign ties. But if it was otherwise, there is this striking difference in their case and that of your sinecure officials: They have been service in the field, and have borne the heat and burden of the war in the past; they have, for a time at least, endured the privations of the camp, and encountered the dangers of the battle-field, whereas your officials have from the beginning enjoyed the same quiet and securing from danger which have fallen to the lot of Your Excellency. Besides, these Confederate officers and men are liable to be summoned to active service at any moment, whereas your
