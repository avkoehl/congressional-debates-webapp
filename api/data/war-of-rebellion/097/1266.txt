WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, June 8, 1865

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond:

If. Mr. Smith will surrender himself you may take such measures as in view of his age and state of health you deem proper to secure his appearance at Richmond when the President requires him to answer any charge that may be brought against him. Your discretion will be satisfactory, either in respect to his close imprisonment, giving bail or parole, as you deem proper.

(Received 10.30 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Ex-Governor Smith has surrendered himself to General Patrick. As soon as he accounts to Governor Peirpoint for all State property for which he is accountable, I propose to parole him as a prisoner of war, to confine himself to his house in Warrenton till further orders, and to report himself at Washington or Richmond to the military authorities of the United States, within five days from the time notice to that effect is left at his house in Warrenton.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
