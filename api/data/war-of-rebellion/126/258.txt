of animals, viz, 53,794 horses and 52,516 mules, for which the sum of $6,107,618.14 was received. It is probable that when full returns shall have been received the total amount of sales of animals from the 8th of May last up to the present time will be found to upward of seven millions of dollars.

As required by the provisions of General Orders, Numbers 42, Quartermaster-General's Office, current series, these sales, with one or two exceptions, have been conducted by employes of this department, and this course has in all cases proved more advantageous to the Government than the employment of the professional auctioneers of any one locality for sales in that locality. The prices obtained by employes are generally greater than those secured by local auctioneers.

The success of this division in supplying the armies in the field has been mainly attributable to the zeal and fidelity of the officers acting under its orders, among whom I would mention-

Bvt. Colonel C. H. Tompkins, assistant quartermaster, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

Captain Ingham Coryell, assistant quartermaster, late in charge at Saint Louis, Mo.

Captain L. Loury Moore, assistant quartermaster, New York City.

Captain George T. Browning, assistant quartermaster, Giesborough, D. C.

Captain E. C. Wilson, assistant quartermaster, Buffalo, N. Y.

Captain J. L. Trumbull, assistant quartermaster, Saint Louis, Mo.

Captain C. Hay, assistant quartermaster, Washington, D. C.

Captain D. W. McClung, assistant quartermaster, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Captain E. C. Reinchenbach, assistant quartermaster, Harrisburg, Pa.

Captain J. M. Bradshaw, assistant quartermaster, late at Chicago, Ill.

Captain H. A. Du Puy, assistant quartermaster, Syracuse, N. Y.

Captain C. H. Gallagher, assistant quartermaster, Wilmington, Del.

In the claim department I have had the valuable assistance of Bvt. Major J. T. Powers, assistant quartermaster.

All these have served faithfully and energetically, and I take pleasure in bearing this testimony to the Quartermaster-General.
