HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-5.05 p. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

A staff officer from a brigade (Brigadier-General McLaughlen's) reported the enemy massing on your left. Ayres' division was sent to you at once. Was this reported to you? Can Ayres return to camp? Do you need him?

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,March 25, 1865-5.25 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I do not know anything of the report made by one of McLaughlen's staff. No such report was made to me. I presume it is based upon the report made by prisoners, who stated they would keep at us until they took our line. Other prisoners said that Lee was massing on the extreme left of our army. I have sent to Colonel Robinson to ascertain if he knows anything of this report. I don't think the enemy will attempt our line, and therefore do not think we will need General Ayres' division.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
