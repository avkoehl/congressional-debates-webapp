JAMES HILL'S, SR., March 31, 1865-8.45 p. m.

MAJOR: I find the enemy encamped on Huntsville and Tuscaloosa road at White's, three miles from point where Huntsville road comes into Tuscallosa road and six miles from this place. Their strength not yet ascertained. I am closing around them with the view of attacking at daylight in the morning, which I prefer if they remain till that hour, or, if they move, to-night, and will drive into them. I am placing a force between them and Tuscaloosa. Have also directed Colonel Cox, who is in charge of artillery and train, and some fifteen miles from here, that in case I do not gain their front and they advance on Tuscaloosa, to fall back before them, impeding their progress; to notify Colonel Hardcastle, commanding post, to have everything in readiness to meet them, and to tear up planks on the bridge and remove them, nothing preventing. All appears bright, and I expect success.

Respectfully,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
