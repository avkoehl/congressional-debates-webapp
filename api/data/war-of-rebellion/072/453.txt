In conclusion allow me to offer my most respectful compliments to the general commanding the division upon the conspicuous part borne by his command in this memorable campaign. It is with great pride that we look back to it, and we trust that we will not be deprived of his presence in future campaigns on account of his wound. I deem it my duty to thank him for his indulgence of my short comings in command of the brigade, to which responsibility I was unexpectedly called, and for the advice and instruction which I received from him on all occasions; and I trust that the conduct of the brigade meets with his approval.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. KNEFLER,

Colonel Seventy-ninth Regiment Indiana Volunteers.
