instant-and were closely pursued by our cavalry. Roddey's band, numbering about 1,000 men, were at the tunnel last night, and may attempt to form a junction with Wheeler. By last accounts our forces were gaining advantages over the enemy all the time, and had high hopes that they would capture the entire crowd. The rebels declare that they are striking for our communications where-ever they can reach them. Will take care of everything below Murfreesborough and at that place.

Brig. General R. S. GRANGER,

Nashville:

The general commanding is informed that our men captured, paroled, and set at liberty by the enemy's cavalry are being sent, under orders from you, to paroled camps. These men are set at liberty contrary to the terms of the cartel and General Orders, No. 100, War Department; hence cannot be considered prisoners and must be at once arrested and returned to duty. Orders have been sent to Louisville to return men who have already gone forward.

By order of General Rosecrans:
