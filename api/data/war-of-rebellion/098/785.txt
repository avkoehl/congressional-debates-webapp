to see and report the position of the same. This brigade was thrown into a gap between General Morgan's left and some portions of General Carlin's right; its arrival was fortunate indeed. The active foe had already discovered this weakness and was hurrying two columns to the left and rear of General Morgan when General Cogswell struck him a stunning blow, cutting off two regiments, or parts of two, and checking immediately the advance.

How efficient the service of this brigade may have been, I have others to decide. Through three times relieved, the enemy failed to dislodge the valiant Cogswell and his brave officers and men.

My loss in this battle, confined as it was to one brigade, was severe, as per accompanying report.

On the 20th I extended and advanced my left, feeling for the enemy's line, and fortified in an advanced position. On the 21st developed his line toward Mills Creek in a reconnaissance. Withdrew in obedience to orders upon the 22nd, and marched to the rear and left for Cox's Bridge and Goldsborough, which latter I reached on the 24th, and encamped on the right of the Fourteenth Corps, two miles and a half north of the town.

In closing this, my report, I desire to especially mention my brigade commanders-Colonel Case, Colonel Dustin, and Brevet Brigadier-General Cogswell-who, by their prompt obedience of orders, their fidelity in their execution, their personal supervision of, and their active interest in each day's duty, through the many and great difficulties incident to a march of 475 miles through an enemy's country, over indifferent country roads at best, now rendered bogs and sloughs by rain and heavy trains, over many deep and rapid river, through almost impassable swamps, they have carried our heavy transportation without loss, and our soldiers in good health and spirits, undismayed alike upon the route, in bivouac, or upon the battle-field; the officers and men have uniformly displayed that prompt and ready obedience to orders which characterizes the good soldier.

I desire also to mention in terms of highest praise the gentlemen of my staff-Surgeon Grinsted; Captain Speed, assistant adjutant-general; Captain Chipman, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain Lacey, assistant quartermaster; Captain Beecher, assistant commissary of musters; Captain Crawford, aide-de-camp; Captain Scott, aide-de-camp; Captain Burgess, ordnance officer; Captain Rennie, ambulance officer; Lieutenant Harryman, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Thompson, provost marshal; Lieutenant Hardenbrook, pioneer officer; Lieutenant Tuttle, topographical engineer-who, by their attention to duty and their intelligent comprehension of orders, have rendered invaluable assistance upon the march and on the battle-field.
