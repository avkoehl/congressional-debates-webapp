work was more than he with the few officers he had to assist him could accomplish, and his success though very commendable has come short of his wishes. I have made such recommendations to the General-in-Chief as I hope will insure in future a better state of the camp. The paroled troops at the camp belonging to regiments serving in the West have been ordered to Camp Chase and Benton Barracks, pursuant to General Orders, Numbers 72, of June 28, 1862, which was perhaps the chief object hope to be gained by these complaints.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier General J. H. MARTINDALE,

Commanding District of Washington, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith rolls of citizen prisoners held in Old Capitol Prison who under the direction of the Secretary of War will be embarked on board the steamer State of Maine on Saturday, the 14th instant, under the charge of Captain J. E. Mulford, Third New York Volunteers, for City Point via Fort Monroe, there to be exchanged for prisoners to be delivered from Richmond. It is possible that some of those on the Old Capitol Prison list may be charged with offenses which will debar them from the privilege of an exchange, and others may be added to the list. Please direct that all shall be prepared to embark on Saturday and have rations issued for the voyage. Three days will I presume be sufficient. Each prisoner will be permitted to take for himself such reasonable supply of clothing as he may have in use and a sum of money to exceed $500; but this allowance will depend somewhat ont the person and the circumstances. A guard will be ready to receive the prisoners on the steamer, and it will only be necessary to conduct them from the prison to her. Prisoners are expected from Sandusky to go in the steamer and I am therefore unable now to say at what hour she will be ready to leave, but by to-morrow evening I will be able to fix the time. Have the kindness to direct that the accompanying rolls be delivered to Captain Mulford with the prisoners. Charles K. Sherman, now a prisoner at the Old Capitol, is not to be exchanged at present; and though his name is not on the list I think it best to mention his case lest by accident he should be included among those sent to the steamer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

P. S. - Since writing the foregoing I have learned that the are prisoners at the Old Capitol whose names have not been furnished to me. I expect a list this morning and will send it to you as soon as received.
