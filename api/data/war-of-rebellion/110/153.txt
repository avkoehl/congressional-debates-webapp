must move carefully, as there may be obstructions on the track. A part of his force on each train must be ready for action, as it is possible that straggling marauders may fire upon him. He will receive the instructions I have given Colonel Hawes, and direct that officer to report to me as soon as he can dispense with his services. He will telegraph me from all stations and state disposition of his guards. He will make arrangements to obtain accurate information from advance.

BOWLING GREEN, September 20, 1861.

General A. S. JOHNSTON:

Please direct Colonel Wickliffe and troops at Mayfield to be mustered into service. Rousseau had not got this side of Floyd's Fork yesterday. He was repairing the bridge. He has about 3,000 men, according to reliable information. It is currently reported in Louisville that the troops from Garrard County will join Rousseau. The fleet of boats and barges passed Clover Point on their way down three days since. I have some hopes of success in reference to the lower dam in Green River. In a day or two some of the home guards at Green River have voluntarily given up their arms. News relative to public feeling rather cheering. General Anderson has arrested ex-Governor Morehead and other prominent Kentuckians and sent them to Indiana Penitentiary.

HEADQUARTERS CENTRAL DIVISION OF Kentucky,Bowling Green, September 21, 1861.

Colonel HELM:

In consequence of conflicting reports, I will re-enforce you with 400 or 500 men under Major George B. Cosby. They will approach from Russellville. You will form a junction with them at a point eight or ten miles south of Rochester (Camp Prentice), at a point where the old Greenville and the Bowling Green road comes into the road from Morgantown to Rochester. A guide will be sent across the country to join you on the march to-night or to-morrow morning from Russellville. It is important that you run no risk. Your movement should be a sure one. You must effect your junction with Cosby before you attack, unless your information is positive that your force is far superior in numbers. You must be at the point of junction mentioned to-morrow night.

Brigadier-General.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

Your dispatch just received. One Mississippi regiment in Middle Tennessee, the other here, which I hope will be permitted to remain. To give it up would probably force me to withdraw from Kentucky.

Brigadier-General.
