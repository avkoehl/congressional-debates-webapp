GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY AND DIST. OF N. C., Numbers 28. New Berne, N. C., March 9, 1864.

The moment when we are threatend with an advance by the enemy is the proper time to remind the gallant officers and soldiers of this command of the results of the recent operations in North Carolina. Besides the repulse of general Pickett's army at New Berne, the following have captured: Six officers, 281 prisoners and dangerous rebels, 500 contrabands, 250 arms and accouterments, 138 horses and mules, 11 bales of cotton, 1 piece of artillery, caisson complete, 1 flag, many saddles, harness, and wagons. Much property of the Government has been destroyed from inability to remove it, as appears by partial list: 250,000 pounds of pork, 80 barrels of lard, 75 barrels of meat, 20,000 bushels of corn, 32 barrels of beef, 5 hogsheads of sugar, 5,000 empty sacks, 1 corn-mill, 10 wagons, 1 ton of tobacco, 18 mules, 2 warehouses of salt, and 2 extensive salt manufactories. Thousands of have entered the lines and resumed their allegiance to the Federal Union with joy and gladness.

these valuable services will be appreciated by the Government and the people, and this brief allusion to them should stimulate all to renewed energy in the final campaign against the revolutionists.
