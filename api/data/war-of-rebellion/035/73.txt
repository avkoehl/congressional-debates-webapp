Van Dorn is crossing at Florence. About 2,000 men and six guns are at Waynesborough, waiting for him.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, February 16, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

We have annoyed Van Dorn, and taken some 50 prisoners from him. He has not got all across the river yet. Some 50 deserters came in yesterday from Tullahoma. They all say Bragg is going to fall back to Bridgeport. He is crossing an engine to Decatur, to run on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, and gather up the corn in the valley bought by the C. S. Army. If you get knowledge when it gets to running, let me know, and I will capture it. Roddey took 1,500 men with him, mostly conscripts. I got about 200 of his command. Van Dorn told one of my wounded men, who was a prisoner, that he could not stay to fight us, as he was ordered to get to Bragg immediately. His actions indicate this. I will co-operate with gunboats.

G. M. DODGE.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 16, 1863.

Colonel W. W. LOWE,

Commanding Fort Henry:

Brigadier-General Dodge, Corinth, telegraphs that Van Dorn, with 2,000 cavalry and six pieces of artillery, is crossing the Tennessee at Florence. Take most prompt measures for strengthening your position by fortifying, &amp; c. Notify Colonel Harding to do the same.

W. S. ROSECRANS,
