CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, Md., September 27, 1863.

(Received 9.10 p.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

The following dispatch was received from our agent at Grafton at 4.45 this p.m.:

The order by telegraph to stop the troops here was sent by one of General Schurz's staff. I did not recognize it,and had some difficulty with the general on his arrival here. Had great difficulty in preventing his taking possession of an engine, and running on after the trains to try to overtake them. He has telegraphed from here to Fairmont to have them stop there until he comes up.

To which I have replied as follows:

CONDUCTOR OF MILITARY TRAINS,

Fairmont:

In the name of the Secretary of War and Major-General Hooker, as well as my own, I direct you to proceed with your trains according to the orders and arrangements made for you by Captain Willard or our agents, without regard to any orders from General Schurz or his staff, or other parties proposing to stop you on any pretext whatever. Let me know at once and distinctly what military officer undertakes to interfere with this order.

W. P. SMITH.

WAR DEPARTMENT, September 27, 1863-9.40 p.m.

Major General CARL SCHURZ,

Fairmont:

Major-General Hooker has the orders of this Department to relieve you from command and put under arrest any officer who undertakes to delay or interfere with the orders and regulations of the railroad officers in charge of the transportation of troops.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, September 27, 1863-9.40 p.m.

Captain WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Baltimore:

You have done exactly right. I have telegraphed Schurz that he will be relieved and put under arrest if he undertakes to interfere with the transportation. You need not have furnished him an extra, but let him and any other officers who lag behind, get along the best they can.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, September 27, 1863-9.50 p.m.

Captain WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Baltimore:

To prevent any improper interference by military officers, I would suggest that your telegraphic agents by directed not to transmit any orders or directions by any officers, except General Hooker or his staff, but would delay transportation, but send them to you. You are authorized to do so.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
