THE CONGRESSIONAL- GLOBE.

clanking of their chains? Six, nine, ten_, twelve
months have elapsed and these prisoners still rot in
jail—one hundred American citizens, equal in in-
tellect to the average of the men listening to me,
American soldier?, without one solitary tact being
alleged against some or proved against any." *
* * * "I know that we cannot alter the
British law; but I have quoted the words of Baron
Fitzgerald himself in making up the minute which
was taken in one of these cases from the court below
to the court above, that there was no proof of any
act done except coming to Ireland and having been
said some months or years before to be connected
with what they oall the Fenian organization, and if
this be true I do say here that the President and the
Secretary of State and our minister in England and
this Congress and this House would be derelict in
their duty if, believing theso facts to be true, they
do not make just such a peremptory demard as I
ask for here."
The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Eld-
ridge] supported me in asking for immediate
action and protesting against referring the sub-
ject to the committee. I thank him for it, and
I thank him now for remaining to support me
again when others fail.
My colleague from the Albany district [Mr.
Pbuyn] and others seeming to desire time for
reflection, and to inquire into the facts, I offered
to let the resolution lie over till the next morn-
ing ; but the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
Washbukne] wished to settle the question
forthwith. The House refusing to adjourn, I
u rged that the resolution should not be referred,
but that immediate action should be had upon
it; that there had been ten thousand times too
long and inexcusable delay. I concluded my
remarks in these words :
"The chains are on thelimbsof American citizens,
the iron of the British despot is rusting on the bones
of sovereigns superior to their sovereign—with more
brain, more intellect, each one of them than their
sovereign has. And while we adjourn from day to
day frQm our comfortable seats to our plentiful meals
and our soft, downy beds, these American citizens,
soldiers, heroes, are insulted in every quarter of Great
Britain." * *• * * "I want something
done, and I want itdone now. If you refuse to adjourn
let us meet this question now and put it in the power
of the President to act." * * * * 'Sir,
wo are all comfortable; we are eating and drinking
and faring sumptuously, and swinging round the eir-
clcs ot fashionable frivolity, but do not seem to appre-
ciate tho fact that one hundred American citizens,
unconvicted and charged with no crime, are to-day
pining in cold, damp British jails, badly fed and
poorly clothed, while no man is raising a hand to liber-
ate them, or a voice to comfort them, or a cup of
consolation to their quivering lips. _
'• Sir, I want to show that we are in earnest; and 1
intend, God giving me strength, to press this subject
in every way and. without cessation. If I do not
succeed now you will hear from me again, unlc^j.my
voice or my health iail me, as they have almost tailed
me to-day. At the risk of both, however, I have
advocated and will continue to demand prompt and
cncrgetic action."
I then moved the previous question on the
immediate passage of the resolution, but could
only get twenty-nine votes. I then called for
the yeas and nays on referring the resolution
to the committee, declaring that it would be
the end of the whole matter, but the reference
was carried by a vote of eighty-one yeas to
thirty-eight nays. Sick and sorrowful I left this
Chamber. My indisposition and other causes
prevented my attendanceatthesucceeding meet-
ings of the committee, and afterward necessi-
tated my return home; but I promised you
that with God's help I should press this sub-
ject in every way and without cessation. I
am here with renewed health and vigor to keep
my word, and you shall know no peace till this
matter is settled. I shall devise meaus to keep
it before the House, the country, and the world
till the prison bars that shut hoarsely upon
these American citizens shall ring out the
inusic of their deliverance. They shall be free.
They shall conic home. Their sorrowing hearts
shall brighten in the light of the stars, and
their blushes shall be hidden in the crimson of
their flag. In recounting this story of their
wrongs and the history of our delays to right
them, I have no intention of blaming or offend-
ing any one; I only wish to rouse attention to
the outrages over which our sensibilities seem
stupefied and our manhood paralized.
Why, sir, notwithstanding all the declara-
tions of my distinguished frfends who insisted
on having this subject referred to the Commit-
tee on Foreign Affairs, promising prompt action
as soon as the' facts were officially ascertained,
I pray you.to hear me when I mention as a tact
patent on the records of this House that the
official record of Warren's trial, published by
the queen's reporter, has been officially before
this House since the 10th of February last, now
ten months, with Congress in session more
than half of the time—technically the whole
time—with that record in print and upon the
desks of members, showing clearly that War-
ren was.tried, convicted, and is suffering penal
servitude for his actions beneath our flag, so
ignominiously insulted in the face of mankind
and in the light, of this latter half of the nine-
teenth century.
Sir, a few months ago a colored woman was
put out of a car between this city and Alexan-
dria. That was a matter of assault and battery
at best, triable and of easy remedy in any of
our petty courts ; but the proceedings in one
House of Congress were absolutely suspended
till the smallest rights of this humblest citizen
of the Republic were vindicated. The very
respectable colored citizen who caters for the
members of this House on the floor below had
received some cross look or word or treatment
from some eiiploy^ of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad, and the wheels of that railroad, if not
even the wheels of time, were threatened with
an everlasting stoppage till Mr. Downing gave
a certificate to the Senate that he was satisfied.
It was all right to protect the rights of the
humblest citizen. But, sir, when will either
this House or the House at the other end of
this Capitol take such vigorous measures with
England as we can take with a railroad com-
pany, and refuse to let up on her until War-
ren or Costello sends in a certificate that he is
satisfied? When shall we look for the per-
formance of the vows of the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Bingham] concerning
the "honor of the Commonwealth?" _ Hashe'
read the official report, and does he still doubt
that Warren was tried for acts done in the United
States, and will he join me now to "interpose
the whole power of the nation to shield our
citizens from being.li eld to answer for crimes not
committed where they were held to answer?"
Sir, it will be in your memory that over a
year ago, while speaking on this very subject,
I called attention to and gave England credit
for the prompt manner in which she vindicated
the rights of her citizens traveling abroad.
How her people were deeply moved, and her
armies and navies swiftly flew to Abyssinia to
avenge an insult given her in the imprisonment
of her subjects by Theodoras. She avenged
that insult over the ruined capital and the life-
less corpse of the sovereign who had dared to
imprison, but had neither condemned nor sen-
tenced the humblest of her citizens. When
shall our armies and- navies return from such
a vindication of our insulted honor ?
When shall we welcome back an American
Napier and crown him with effulgent honors
who returns to us with our national honor
vindicated by rescuing from their imprison-
ment our citizens, even it it had to be done
over the lifeless body of the sovereign and
from the battered and smoking ruins of the
capital of the country that dared to insult our
nationality?
At the breaking out of our war many English
subjects were guilty of all that was chaiged
against Warren, yet, England, when we arrested
any of them, demanded their release, and we
complied. Not one of the hordes of British
blockade runners taken in the act were- tried
as Warren was ; and even Lord Derby, Lord
Stanley's father, then talked civis Romanus
sum as volubly as George Francis Tram now
talks civis Americanus sum. in the btate
Department's publication of the diplomatic
correspondence, Thirty - Seventh Congress,
third session, volume one, 1862-68, commenc-
ing at page 27, will be found the following
remarks in the House of Lords, reported m
the London Morning Post of hebruary II,
1862, and sent to the State Department by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams, our then minister to
England, under date of February 13, 18b^:
" The Earl of Carnarvon said he was anxioiu to ask
a question of some importance of the noble earl tnc
secretary for foreign affairs. The .house wpul&.re-
member th«,t on Friday last he made some remarks .
on the case of an Bnglishman in America who had
been taken into'custody and sent to prison under the
warrant of Mr. Seward. Since Friday he had.re-
ceived further information in reference to similar
cases, but they were, if possible, worse than the one
he then mentioned. He understood that at this mo-
ment there were no less than three British subjects
who had been for four or five months coiiihied in
Lafayette prison, and they had been detained there
.without any charge of any sort or kind having been
made against them. There had been no mqtnry
made into their cases. \An inquiry had been asked
for, but it had been refused, unless they first con-
sented to take the oath of allegiance to the Govern-
ment of the United States, Now, if that were so, it
wo a clear that those persons had been illegally ar-
rested. illegally imprisoned, and illegally detained,
and there ought not to be a moment lost before
clearly understanding the presentposition of affairs.
In these American prisons there were confined
person? of every rank and means and intelligence,
and many who had been brought up .in affluence
—thero were representatives of the liberal profes-
sions—of the bar, the press, and the judicature."
# * * # "The names of the British sub-
jects were Charles Green, formerly a British mer-
chant resident at Savannah. He wentfrom Liver-
pool, and his connexion with this country had been
maintained to tho present time, for ho had now a
son residing at Liverpool. The next person was
Andrew Lowe> also a British merchant residing at
Savannah, and he had children now at school at
Brighton." * * * ' *' *
"Now, if these persons had broken the laws 01 the
United States they ought to be brought to trial, and
if they wero found guilty then letthem be sentenced
according as the law directed? but if they had not
broken any law then they ought not to be kept in
prison for an indeliniteperiod.anidonsecretcharges.
He understood that an inquiry would be directed
into the cases of these persons, but Mr. Seward made
it a preliminary condition that they should take the
oath of allegiance to the Government of the United
States. Now, the very fact that theso persons would
not do that served to show that thoy were British
subjects. He wished to know how tar the noble earl
had been informed of these things, and what steps
or measures he had taken to obtain redress.
"Earl Hussell said: I conclude that the noble earl
has hardly read tho papers which have been laid
upon the table of the house by command of her
Majesty; for tho noble earl would there havo lound
a correspondence between Lord Lyons and Mr. Sew-
ard, and also between her Majesty's Government and
Lord Lyons, on this subject. The noble earl, in his
statement, seems hardly to have taken into account
the very critical circumstances in which thoOrovern-
ment of the United States has been placed. In the
spring of last year nine of the States in the scheme ot
confederation declared war against the Government
of tho United States. In sucli circumstances as theseit
is usual for all Governments to imprison upon suspi-
cion persons whom they consider arc taking part in
the war against thorn. In a case which happened,
not many years ago, namely, 1848, when there was a
conspiracy for tho purpose of overturning the author-
ity of her Majesty, the secretary of state. applied to
the other house of Parliament for authority to arrest
persons on suspicion, namely, for the suspension ot
the habeas corpus act, and in the papers presented
to Parliament at that date thero wero two cases m
which the lord lieutenant of Ireland had ordered the
arrest of two American persons; a complaint was
thereupon made by the American Government, and
my noble friend, (Lord Palmorston,) at that time at
tho head of the foreign office, replied that "with re-
gard to those persons tho lord lieutenant had duo
information, upon which he relied, that those per-
sons wore engaged in practices tending to subvert
tho authority of the Crown, and wero aiding Prac-
tices which were being pursued in that part ot the
kingdom. Those persons wero never brought to
trial, but on that authority they were arrested. Alter
this civil war broke out in America complaints were
made by ceKain British subjects that they had been
arrested upon suspicion. I immediately directed
Lord Lyons to complain of that act as an act enforced
by tho sole authority of the President of the United
States, and especially in regard to one of those per-
sons there seemed very light grounds for suspicion,
and I said he ought not to be detained.

"Lord Lyons represented to me that these cases
took up a very great part of his time, and he was
anxious to investigate every one of thern.^ JNor can
1 say that Mr. Seward has refused at any time to lis-
ten to thoso complaints." * * " An
innocent person being arrested and connnedlor sev-
eral days in prison was undoubtedly a great griev-
ance, and one for which he was entitled to compen-
sation." * * * * "lwas not aware oi
the cases the noble earl would mention. But with
regard to Mr. Green this is the statement he mad j
on the 5th of September: 'T desire no action to be
taken by my friends in England in consequence ot
my arrest. Lord Lyons has represented iny case, ana
it will receive investigation in due time. Meanwuue
I am in the hands of the officers of this tort.
* * * But in every case where a.Bntjsa
subject is arrested, and a reasonable case is made
out for him, I shall be ready to instruct kord L?
to bring the case under the consideration of the uov
ernment of the Unitedftates. Lord Lyons!i^.uown
been wanting in his duty. He has, I think, s _
himself a vigilant British minister in that lespoct,
