of boats to be brought from Norfolk. Every effort will be made to ascertain promptly his strength. I telegraphed General Peck on the subject last night, after my return from Suffolk, in consequence of a dispatch from General Butterfield stating that Hood's and Pickett's divisions were reported on General Hooker's front. I have just received a dispatch from General Peck in which he says deserters from Pickett's division state that they saw Pickett yesterday and that no brigades have gone from Longstreet's command. They received orders to be ready to move last night, but the orders were countermanded. One of the deserters-a Texan-says that Hood was there yesterday. Jenkins' division is before Suffolk. I will direct General Peck to make a reconnaissance in force and will be ready to make the movement referred to by you promptly.

General E. D. KEYES, Yorktown, Va.:

Our cavalry ought yesterday or to-day to have been in rear of enemy, on the Richmond and Fredericksburg road, at its crossing of the Pamunkey or in that vicinity, and have destroyed it. Use every possible means to get any information, and telegraph it to us and oblige. Things are very lively here now.

Let me ask explanation of the last clause-no signs of a movement then. Does that refer to Longstreet's move or General Hooker's?
