volution taking place in public opinion on the subject of includ-
ing banks m the compulsory provision of that oil! Poi his
own part,hecjald baiely meet with a single intelligent man,
who was not in favor of subjecting these pernicious corpora
tions to the operations of the law He believed it the only
way the Federal power could be restored over the currency,
when the sword of justice was suspended over them, they would
be made to conduct their business in such a manner as would
not prove injurious to the public interests
Mr WRIGHT presented seveial memorials—one signed by
34 citizens, who (Mr W said) were the most intelligent classes
Among them was the Mayoi ofthecity They were ail friends

that the BinkiuH law may be amended or repealed
By Mr PRFS TON From citizens of Boston, New York, and
Philadelphia, as cmg that the law may be amended or re
pealed
Mr PRESTON said he was deeply impressed with the no
tion that the repeal of a law presented a very different case from
the enactment of a law It was proper that there should be
permanent y and fitednesd m the laws of the country, and lm
pioper'hat a law should be repealed six months after us en
actment He would have no difficulty in reference to the Bank
rupt law ifhis objections were not of a veiy deep rooted cha
racter In voting therefore, for the repeal of the law, as he
should when it came up, it would be under the impression that
the law was bad tu itseli The enactment at the last te^ion of
Congiess looked to repeal or esbenudl nudification oí the law
The passage, in s mesoit wa* a notice to the people wi lung
for the benefits of this bill tint the law should be amended It
seemed to him wrong, however, that, at the very moment the
cup was offered to ihur lips, it should then be dashed fiom
them, as was proposed in the repeal of the law In the cha
racter oftheact alone could he reconcile it toa «enseof duty to
do this But he felt him&elf impeuuusly bonnd to vote for the
repeal He sepanted himself with gLeatieluctance from lus
friends of the extra session of Congress upon this question But
since then his opposition to the measure had been mide strong
er and wider by tha suosequent events that had intervened His
own State was unanimous agairst the law, and there was no
c ass or paity therein avorofit Theagnoultural people too,
who lormed the majority in all sections of the countiy, were
opposed to the la* We were is was well known amoral
paople To thu class of persons a bankrupt law would
never be advantageous, and nevei, m any shape, acceptable
to them.
The geienl proposition is as had been stated \ bankrupt

I confess to the Senate (said Mr P ) tint T ti > lament for one,
that this power is conferred upon this Government I w,s, i it
wasconfenedupon th bta r& exclusively, ai i I doubt whether
this Government should er art an; bid nipt system whatever
I would not say thu it was impo & ble to make a permarent
law ofa ptospectivecharacter Oi this I hive my d>ub s, hut
what I mean to say i«, that any bankt upt hi Í is difh^u t dan

He would, under present convictions, be willing to suireniiet
Shisw io e power to the ¡States themselves, regar dins: it as must
pto\a ly belonging to them.   lam deeply convinced that the
law willjnot work well, (said Mr P ) I am not insensible of the
general embarrassments of the last four years I know that
they have resulted from the misconduct of the Government for
the last four years, passive or active The Government had
been pm ticeps cnmints in the misfortunes of the people
Nevertheless, said he, I have a settled feeling of aversion of re
hefof any kind by Government acts inteifenng between man
and man This bill was a relief system, and it was better to
submit to the present temporary evils than to interfere with
the private affairs of the people of the United States The States
themselves weie much more highly fitted to manage these deli
cate matter  than the United States was, and, therefore, as at
present advised, (said Mi P ) I am more opposed to the Bank-
rjpt bill now than I was at the extrasession of Congress when
I voted a amst it
Mi BUCHANAN said he merely wished to correct a misap-
prehension which prevailed extensively throughout the coun-
try and seemed to exist in the mind of the Senator from South
Carolina, as to the extent of the necessity for the passage of a
Bankrupt law by Congress
There was no principle of constitutional law more firmly
settled than that the several States possess the power ot pa«s
mg bankiupt laws which shall extend to all future eontracts
made between citizens of the State where such a law existed
Nay,more if the citizen of a State wheie such bankrupt law
existed, became the debtor of a citizen of another State, and
tonk thebenefit of hisown State bankrupt law, his foreisrn ere
ditor would be bound by the discharge, provided he bad ac
cepted a dividend of the debtor's property The foreign credi
tor would always accept the dividend, even if it were very
small, rather than lose his whole debt Th.3 only necessity,
therefore, for the passage of a bankrupt Jaw by Congress,
would be to provide for the discharge from retrospective con
tracts, and from obligations m ca«es in which the citizen of
another State refused to accept his dividend of the bankrupt's
effects
Mr BERRIEN, in presentmga memorial fromHarrisbm*,
remonstrating asamst the repeal of the law, made some re'
marks to prove the necessity of a bankrupt law by Congress
but distinctly admitted that Mr. Buchanan had stated the law
correctly It was true, he said, that the Supreme Court had
decided that it was competent for the State Legislatures to
pass a prospective bankrupt law, but it was nevertheless true
that that law could not operate beyond the limits of that State
And when the debtor who had availed himself of the benefi s
of a bankrupt law of his State should pase, the bounds of his
State, he would be subjected to the action of other Legislatures
upon the subject Therefore, such laws as could be passed by
the States would oe found to be inadequate
Mr BUCHANAN then expressed his pleasure at their con
eurrence in opinion on the points of constitutional law, and re
iterated his statement of the law as it now stood, in order to
fix the attention of the countiy upon i-t A discharge under
a Statp bankrupt law fta? ahsol uie between citizens ofthe same
State, and would release the debtor from all contracts m every
State of theUmon as against all foreign creditors who had accept
ed a dividend This would be accepted in every case w here the
debtor had not held on until he had exhausted his whole pro
perty.
Mr CLAY presented a memorial fiom the city of Philadel-
phia, for ihe repeal of the Birkrupt law The memorialists

amendments which were worthy of consideration

gence and patriotism
Mr Huntinotov said that since he had had the honor of a
seat on this floor he had voted twice in favor of i general Rank
rupt law In regard to the merits ofthe question he hat: seen
no reason to chiuge hi& opinion and believing that such a law
wis one due to the mentón ms debtor and was for the equal ben
efk of the creditor when the bill to repeal came up he should
vote against it When the mo ion come uo, too, he should ex
pre s his views upon th constitutionality,jjbtice, and expe
di°ncy of this law At present he contented himself with pre

Mr ALIEN made some effort to have his resolution of in

Mr WOOUBURY said $i4 regretted exceedingly, that the
motion to stiike out the pro"fc/so in the bill had been made. He
thought that when the Senate undeistood the real operation of
the motion, their regret would be no le-s than his It must of
necessity open the whole question as to the proper amount of
receipts and expenditures for the year Tnese had already
been discussed by the chanman The direct tendency of it
was to delay (he passage oí a bill for days, if not weeks, which
the official oigan oí the Treasury Department here (Mr.
Evans) had stenunusly argued was much needed Theme
lancholy picture that he had di awn of the insolvency, dis-
credit and embairas^ment, which now hung ovei the Adminis-
tration, wa" not overcolored Even the hardy fishermen were
unable to obtain their much wanted bounties, and yet, the re
presentative of the Treasuiy makes this motion, that must in-
evitably lead to iurtherdelay
