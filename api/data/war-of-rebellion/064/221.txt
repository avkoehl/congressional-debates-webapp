WARRENSBURG, June 4, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

Philips' movement is to the southeast. The guerrillas are directly opposite, course northwest. Philips moving at this time does not leave force enough to occupy the country. Our troops are moving night and day constantly, and daily fight the guerrillas. The guerrillas have no lines of retreat to cut off. They scatter when attacked, each man taking a separate route, meeting at some agreed point 20 miles off in four hours. Our troops understand this warfare, are full of zeal, are brave and energetic, but it is an intangible warfare. If there is not urgent reason, I respectfully ask that the order to move the Seventh Regiment be suspended until we see what the guerrillas intend, and I can thoroughly scour the country.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

SAINT LOUIS, June 4, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Warensburg:

You ask a very serious thing. Why not let Philips move on the guerrillas and go to Springfield at the same time? What if the route be a little circuitous; can't you combine other force with his and clean the country out? What is wanted seems to me to be to know the country and whereabouts of all this vague cloud of guerrillas, and have a rapid night and day movement to surprise them, so directing the forces as to intercept their probable routed of entreat. Let me know if this can be done. Now is the time for brains and energy, and there must be no halting or flinching by the officers or men, and no fear of night or day movements.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
