On the 1st of March, 1866, oar debt reached
the highest figure. It then amounted to
52.823,924,959 ; or, deducting the cash in the
Treasury, to $2,707,906,000. From the 1st of
March, 1866, to the 1st of March, 1867, we paid
of the principal of this debt $190,064,110; from
the 1st of March, 1867, to the 1st of March,
1SG8, we paid $20,482,266; from the 1st of
March, 1808, to the 1st of March, 1869, we paid
$5,959,918; from the 1st of March, 1869, to
the 1st of March, 1870, to-morrow, estimating
for a few days, we have paid $86,695,629 of
our bouded indebtedness—making an actual
payment in four years of $303,201,725, or
an average payment of the ascertained debt
during the last four years of $75,800,431.
Not only that, but we have paid in addition
a large mass of unliquidated debt. I have in
my liand a statement or estimate prepared by
the Secretary of the Treasury, showing that
during four years we have paid $777,540,634
of unliquidated debt in addition to the $303,-
201,725 of the principal of the liquidated debt;
making the total payments, besides interest,
over one thousand million dollars in four years
on the public debt. This unliquidated debt
consisted of supplies furnished, of unpaid re-
quisitions, of bounties and backpay, and other
debts in various forms outstanding not entered
on the books of the Treasury, but just as much
the debt of the country as five-twenty bonds.
All these have been paid from the ordinary
revenues of the Government in addition to the
$303,000,000 of bonds. It is believed that it
is high time the people of the United States
should be somewhat relieved from the pay-
ment of the public debt, and that the policy
of paying so large a sum should be suspended,
but we should faithfully carry out the obliga-
tions of the contract and pay. at least one per
cent annually.
Mr. President, I have shown by the refer-
ence that I have made that during the present
year, the first year of General Grant's admin-
istration, we have paid $86,000,000 of the pub-
lic debt; and that during the last year of Mr.
Johnson's administration there were only five
or six millions of the public debt paid under
the Same revenue laws. This presents a favor-
able aspect for the party to which the great
majority of the Senate belong. I wish to carry
it a little further. I have a table here showing
the receipts and expenditures of the last year
of Mr. Johnson's administration compared
with the receipts and expenses of the first year
of General Grant's administration,. and the
result ia highly favorable to the Republican
party. Although I do not intend to drag into
this discussion anything like political contro-
versy, yet it is due to the Administration that
these official figures should be put on record,
so that it may have the benefit of the credit
due to its management of our public finances.

As I have already shown, there has actually
been paid opon the public debt during the first
year of this Administration $86,649,971, show-
ing that nearly all the money that has been
paid npon the pnblic debt in the past year has
been derived from the Baving in expenditures
and the inereased collection of taxes under the
same laws. The last year of Mr. Johnson's
administration only diminished the principal of
the public debt a little over five millions, while
this Administration in the same period of time
has diminished the public debt $86,000,000.
These are simply facts derived from official
sources and inure greatly to the benefit of the
present Administration. I only hope they will
go on and do better in the future
Mr. President, the three remaining sections
of this bill apply to the national banks. That
is much too great a theme for me to enter npon
at this stage of the debate; but I will explain
in a very few words the theory of those sec-
tions. The national banks are mere creatures
of law. They hold their existence at the pleas-
ure of Congress. We may to-morrow, if it
promotes the public interests, withdraw their
authority. Their franchise has been valuable
to them. We think it right that they should
aid us in funding the public debt. They hold
of our securities $846,000,060. Nearly all of
these bear six per cent, interest in coin. We
will not deprive them of any of them; we will
not take from them the property they enjoy;
we will not deny them even the payment of
six per cent, gold interest as long as they are
the owners of these bonds. But they hold the
franchise of issuing paper money guarantied
by the United States, and which constitutes
the circulation of our country; and we say
that, enjoying that franchise, we now stipulate
with them for the reduction of interest on the
bonds they hold. The provisions of this bill
are not arbitrary; they are not harsh ; they
do not take from the national banks any right
which they enjoy except one confessedly at
our pleasure. If they are not content to enjoy
their franchise on the terms proposed they can
retire.
As to new banks which may be organized
under the free-banking section it is eaaier for
them to engage in banking under this bill than
under the old law, because they can go to the
Treasury and buy bonds at par in currency
atld upon these receive circulating notes, and
a corresponding amount of legal tenders is
then canceled. The new banks may issue in
circulating notes four fifths of the amount of
their bonds uaderthe terms and conditions of
the banking act, while if they are now required
to go into the money market to buy bonds with
which to start new banks they would be com-
pelled to pay a premium of from ten to twenty
per cent, for the existing bonds, and then
could only issue ninety per cent, of the amount
of the principal of the bonds.
Mr. HOWE. If it will be no embarrass-
ment to the Senator from Ohio I should like
to ask him one question upon that last sec-
tion. He calls it a free-banking section. I
had some little difficulty on looking at its
first two or three lines in determining whether
or not the privilege of funding United States
notes under that section would be confined to
existing banks, or whether new banks can be
organized under it.
Mr. SHERMAN. I think it is very clear
that the banking system becomes free, and
old and new banks are on an equal footing ;
but if it is not clear it ought to be made so.
The tenth section of this bill is a free-banking
law, opening wide the door for the organiza-
tion of banks to any amount only upon con-
dition that an equal amount of greenbacks
shall be retired as the new notes are issued.
Mr. HOWE. I am glad to hear that explana-
tion of it. My reading of it led me to put the
other construction on it; but I heard the Sen-
ator once before call it a free-banking act, and
then I read it again and saw that it was sus-
ceptible of that interpretation.
Mr. SHERMAN. I invite the scrutiny of
the honorable Senator to that, and I will accept
any modification to make it a free-banking law.
That is the purpose. The only limitation on
it is the amount of greenbacks now outstand-
ing ; and when they are exhausted it will be
for Congress to determine whether we shall go
further.
Such, sir, are the general provisions of this
bill. The great object is the reduction of the
interest of the public debt. If the $1,200,-
000,000 proposed is taken it is a reduction of
our annual taxes of $18,000*000 of gold, rep-
resenting a capital at five per cent, of $360,-
000,000, and the incidental results of this meas-
ure will be as beneficial as the direct saving
of the public treasure. A policy will be adopted
by fixing the minimum to be applied to the
payment of the public debt that will enable us
to ascertain precisely the amount of necessary
taxes. The public debt will be represented by
an annuity of $150,000,000, which will pay
every dollar of it within thirty years. O ur taxes
can then be measured by our appropriations,
with, the constantly pressing lesson that every
new appropriation is a new tax *ad every
saving of appropriation ia the repeal, of tha
most burdensome af existing taxes* And, sir,
the tendency of the measure is t<> tile return
of specie payments. We now again restore to
the United States note its quality of redeem-
ability, a quality that Was only taken from it by
the pressure of the war, and which when re-
stored to it will give it value and stability, will
place it beyond the range of mere gamblers,
and will firmly anchor it upon the credit of
interest-bearing securities, so that while specie
payments are suspended the note will not fail
in market value below the value of your bonds.
Having thus fixed a mode of redemption and
the limit of depreciation you may hope soon
to see these broken promises redeemed and
their place supplied with paper money con-
vertible at pleasure into gold or silver coin.
And, sir, tho beneficial effect of this measure
will be seen in the reduction of the rate of
interest on capital employed in private enter-
prise, which by the usurious rates paid by tho
United States during the war has been forced
to an average in the United States of ten per
cent. This unnatural rate has tended to deter
new enterprises, to accumulate capital, and to
increase prices; for interest i  a onief element
in the cost of all commodities.
The national banks will be required to aid
us by some sacrifices on their part, but oven
this is voluntary with each bank. If any of
them do not choose to enjoy a privilege con-
ferred and held at the pleasure of Congress
they are at liberty to take their property and
retire, Others will gladly avail themselves of
the privilege of buying these bonds, with the
right to issue four fifths of the amount in paper
money npon their security. If bankers whose
profits have been largely increased by the high
premium in gold received of the Government
