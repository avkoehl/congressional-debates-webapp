Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA, Baton Rouge [Natchitoches?], La., June 5, 1865.

Colonel A. DE BLANC,Commanding Reserve:

DEAR SIR: Until the establishment of our post and matters are fully settled I would like to use the reserve force as a mans of preserving quiet throughout the parishes. Can I have your co-operation in this matter? If so, please confer fully with Colonel Van Anda, commanding at this point. The reserve can be paroled at once, or as fast as they come, and still act in the way spoken of above until we got our cavalry fairly moving. They can do much good in preserving order among the negroes and putting down jayhawkers. Will you please give such instructions to them as will accomplish the end we have in view. I had hoped to see you here personally but will not be able to until my return from Shreveport.

With kind regards, colonel, I am, very truly, yours,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.
