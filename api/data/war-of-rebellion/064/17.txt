line than that by which the army marched from Alexandria, and an army operating by this line will possess the great advantages of having its actual base on the Mississippi and its flanks mainly secured by the Red and Washita Rivers, and that of covering by its movements the line of the Arkansas and the frontiers of Missouri. My opinion with regard to these rivers was formed ten years ago, and was the result of an official examination, made with reference to military operations on an infinitely smaller scale than those now contemplated. The character of the rivers has not changed since then, and the reasons why they should not be relied on now are materially the same, but of magnified importance. On my way down the river I directed a quick examination of two of the lines last mentioned to be made, and on my arrival at Vicksburg to-night I expect to learn the present condition of the roads. These routes will [require] no greater force or longer time for preparation than those by the Red River or Washita, and the results will, in my judgment, be infinitely more certain than by either of those rivers.
