pio-
la the House, Mr. EVERETT offered his t
posed amendment, and asked to hare it printed.
Mr CAMBRELENG suggested that it would
be better to have the bill printed as amended in
committee, with the amendment annexed, to -which
Mr Everftt assented, and in that form the mo-
tion prevailed.

panied by a report from the head of the Topo-

The bill from the Senate to authorize the ap-
pointment of an additional judge in the Orphan's
Court in. the District of Columbia, was then taken
up, with an amendment prepared by the Commit-
tee for the District of Columbia
Mr. DAWSON said tnat ah objection had been
made by Mr MercCr to this amendment, on the
giound of unconstitutionality , and he (Mr D.)
contended that, inasmuch as the District of Colum-
bia was a Territory of the United States, according
ing to the decisions of the Supreme Court, tht re
fore Congress had full power over it, as much as
over Wisconsin or Florida
Mr MERCER thought the position of the Dis-
trict of Columba im generis, and not that of a
Territory Every judge undei the Constitution of
the United States is appointed fur life, anil no instance
to the contraiy can be shown
Mr HAYNBS instanced jnstices of the peace m
the District of Columbia as holding office by a limit-
ed tenure.
Mr PETRIKIN said that m the  committee he
had opposed tht  bill, but, being in  the minority,
he consented to have it leported to the House, with
the amendment, limiting the term of service to lour
yeais      His   opposition   was predicated   on   the
grounds that the continuance ol a person in the re-
ceipt of a salaiy, without rendering any sen ires to
the public, was m fact u rating and continuing a
sinttcre in violation ot  the Constitution, and con-
trary to the spirit  of our  fiee  institutions     Our
country was fast following the fcou op* of tht Go-
vernments m Europe, by contmuinr men m office
out of mere sympathy, 01 because tney belonged to
respectable families, although unable to discharge
the duties of the office     The Depaitments  in   the
city of Washington  furnished  many examples of
this kind, and it was high  time  Congress should,
by their action, famish a precedent to those admi-
n   tenng the Government to con ect (disabuse     In
this case, if the present incumbent was incapable
of discharging the duties of ajiidfc, and Congress
had the powet, under the  Constitution, to  remove
him, let members discharge their duties by addres-
sing the President for that purpose, and if Con-
gie s has i ot the constitutional power to remove
him, let the Constitution be amend :d for that pur-
j >i,e, and that can be done by the meeting of next
Congress
Mr. P said he was opposed to sinecures of every
land, and a hard case, or mere expediency, was no
apology for members violating the Constitution It
was a well known fact that in all ages public good
liad been an apology for tyrants setting at naught
the rights of toe people, and expediency, the ex-
cuse of usurpers for trampling upon the liberties of
the people When members objected to the limi-
tation of the term of service of a judge, on consti-
tutional grounds, and at the same lime advocated
trie continuance of an officer m the enjoyment of a
sinecure, he thought, to say the least of it, they took
a one-sidad view of the Constitution He did not
sur pose, however, that any thing he could say
would alter the determination of members on this
subject, but he could not, consistently with his
conscientious notions of what was his duty, suf-
fer a matter so grossly wrong, in his opinion, as
the present bill is, to pass without raising his voice
against it.
Mr. BOULDIN said he supposed, as he was
chairman of the committee, it -would be expected
of him to say something in relation to this bill, yet
he knew that by wearying the House by such de-
bate, he might hazard the bill, rather than render it
more secure
He said his mind had been long made up, that
during good behavior was the best tenure for a
judge to hold his office b>, that when a change is
made fiom good behavior m such offices, it is gene-
rally found to be for bad behavior. He frtiew
there was a difference of opinion upon this pom ,
and he would not provoke argument, as the District
really was suffering for a judge. The present in-
cumbent was, by visitation of Providence, rendered
unable to do the duties of his office.
There could be no constitutional dtfficul'y i*i
appointing an additional judge There was no par-
ticular number of judges constitutionally required
in this case It might be that the meumbent
ought to resign, but h? had not, and Mr B was not
aware of any mode by which he could be com-
pelled to do so, and if he could, it weuld be diffi-
cult to prove he ought to be prosecuted for this
visitation, and though all this were right and ptac-
ucable, yet it would take much time to do it, and
in the mean time the people would, suffer much.
The appointment of another judge would not pre-
vent a prosecution and removal of the present in-
cumbent* should it be practicable and proper
Mr B had given his own opinion on this bill in
as few words as he could, and Would prefer to pass
the bill himself as it c-ime from the Senate, but he
was so sure that the pei pie were in grfat need of
help m tins particular, that he would vote for almost
any meisiue tint would give relief—any thihg
within the pale of the Constituí on He hoped,
(herefoic, Ihit the bill would piss to-day
Mr JENIFER and Mi DAWSON had a few
words of convemiuui, which (on account of the
gieat confusion and noise m the hall) were entirely
mandible
Mi ADAMSthonghKhat, if the pending amend-
ment wan constitutional, then Congress could re-
move the piesent judge lie considered that an
olhtei who did nnl discharge the duties of the of-
fice he held did noi hold it "duringgood behavior "
it ivas inconsistent lo •■ny tint Hie assistant judge
sho lid hold his otlicp undei the Constitution for
four yeais, and ihit the other judge of the mitic
couit should held Ins during good behavioi This
was a provision to change the tenure of olhce of
the judge oí (lie oíprVtis' court If Congress can,
constitutionally, clnnge this tt nitre ot office, the
President may, on applicition, íemoye the office
costing He hoped that neilhei the amendment
nor the bill would pass He thought the proper
course would be to impeach the officer for incom-
petency This had been done, and it seem d to be
the true and pioper mode
Mr POPE thought the amendment ought not to
pass to this bill If this question of the proper
tenure of office weie to be discussed, it should be
at another time. At present, he looked upon this
as a necessary measure lor the trarsacUon of bu-
siness ¡n this District, and it was the duty of Con-
giess to see that the rights of ths District ought to
be religiously and sac redly preserved He hoped
the amendment would be withdrawn
Mr GARLAND, of Virginia, satd he had but
little to say upon ihe subject under consideration,
nor would he say that little, but for the fact that
there weie two impoitant questions involved m the
bill The first was, have the people of the District
of Columbia any constitutional ptotection'* Are
they citizens of the United States, or subjects of an
aristocratic despotism' By the act of cession they
were stripped of the protective power of the consti-
tutions of Virginia and Maryland,and if they «ere
not within the protective powei of the Constitution
of the United States, unlike all other American ci-
tizen , they were without any const tin tional protec-
tion whatever, but the unqualified subjects of the
power of Congress, which can exercise over them
unlimited and unqualified authority. He did not
doubt that, as far as the Constitution applied, the
people of the District of Columbia Were ais much
entitled to its broad shield as they were before the
act of cession He would not now enter into the
discussion of that question, but would content him-
self with this mere expression of opinion If the
Constitution did not not extend to the District of
Columbia, he said that its principles and its spirit
might be earned into the legislation of Congress
affecting it, and thus exiend its beneficial and pro-
tective powers as successfully as if it was directly
applicable, and there was no subject on which its'
principles could be more profitab'y applied than in
the limitation of the judicial tenure
The second question involved was, whether Con-
gress, in establishing the judicial tenure, could, in
reference to the District of Columbia, disregard the
limitation prescribed m the Constitution, of "good
behavior," and affix to it a term of years'!   The
only power winch tms Government has to establish
ajumciary is derived from the Constitution, but the
tenure of the judicial office is not left to the discre-
tion of Congress, but is fixed by  the  Constitution
itself.   If, then, this Government has none but ex-
I*iessly delegated poweis, I  might safely inquiie,
where is the authority lo limit the judicial tenure
to a term of years1 The Constitution having affixed
the tenure, Congress has no power over it, and anv
other tenure would be a usurpation of power, rnd
contrary to the true spirit of that instrument.     He
said he did not now propose to enter into an elabo-
rate  discussion of  this important question,  but
would content himself with remarking, that when
the act passed, establishing the Orphans' Court of
the District of Columbia, the judge was regarded
as a judicial officer, and  the tenure of his office
limited by the authority of the Constitution, and it
would now be establishing a dangerous  plecedent
to chsiegard it     He thought U wise to adhere to the
pr nciples and spirit of the  Constitution   upon all
occasion^ and in none more pertinaciously thau
the tenure of the judicial office      There was no
principle   in Government   more   important   and
mere necessaiv to any  peopb*   than   á  faithful,
an honest,   and   well  qualified  judiciary,   and
there were no other means by which it could be
accomplished than by affixing a tenuie of office
which, while it is placed within the leach of ample
responsibility., is seemed from the effects of sudden
popular exc lenient   and   unfounded   prejudices.
This blessing is as important lo the people of ihs
Distiiot as  to  any  poition of the people of th=
Union, and't would be  unwise and impolitic to
distinguish  between  thun  and thp people of the
States.    Wo man who possessed the pioper qualifi-
cations of a judge would accept the office with a
tenure of four years, and a liability to have his
commission struck dead in his hands by those ebul-
lition   of popular excitement  which   frequently
spnng up on account of his decisions    To secure
competent and well qualified judges, there must be
permanency in the sanure as well as adequacy m
compensation, and the  value of the judicnry will
be entirely dcslnvved when opposite principles are
acted upon     The tenure affixed in the amendment
proposed by the Committee foi the District of Co
lumbia, would, in its general application, be dan-
gerous  m   practice  and  subversive  of  the  best
interests of the country     It was in accordance
with that spirit which had commenced limiting the
tenuie of the judicnl office to a fixed age in some
pkces—to ten years in some, and seven in others—.
a spirit which, said Mr   G   was undermining the
stability of the system, des'rt ymg its most valuable
features, and would ultimately throw the judiciary
into the hands of the ignorant, the illiterate, and
the demagogical    He thought a rebuke of this
destructive spirit would come wnh great force from
Congress, by strictly adhering to the wise and salu-
tary tenure prescribed m the Constitution, which
its framers wou'd not confide  to Congressional
discret on.
Mr G. said the temporary additional judge pro-
posed to be appointed for the Orphans' Court of the
District of Columbia, would not establish a sinecure,
but grew out of the actual necessity of the case In
the organization ot the Court, a single judge had
been appointed    That judge not not misbehave'p
