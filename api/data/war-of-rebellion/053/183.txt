October 8, 1863- 1 p.m.

Colonel A. J. MACKAY,

Acting Chief Quartermaster:

SIR: My train was attacked at this point from the opposite side of the river by I think only a few of the enemy. We are moving slow, and think we will not be injured by the attack. I cannot move very fast on account of the train in my front.

I am, yours,

T. S. MARVIN,

First Lieutenant and R. Q. M. Sixty-fourth Ohio Vol. Inf.

The firing is pretty heavy now, but mostly from our side. While I have been writing three of my mules have been shot while passing.

CAMP GENERAL WOOD'S TRAIN,

White's Plantation, on the Mountain, October 8, 1863-9 p.m.

Colonel A. J. MACKAY,

Acting Chief Quartermaster:

SIR: My train is in park and in good condition. The skirmish of to-day (that I communicated to you at 1 p.m. to-day) was of a worse specimen than what I expected at that time. I lost 2 drivers killed and 2 or 3 wounded slightly, and lost 20 mules killed and wounded so as to disable them from future service. Consequently I had to fill up the train with the extra mules out of those that had only 2 and 3 killed,and I was compelled to leave two wagons at Suck Creek,6 miles from Chattanooga, at the camp of the pioneers. All quiet now. We start at 5 a.m. to-morrow morning.

Colonel, I am, very respectfully, yours, &amp;c..,

T. S. MARVIN,

First Lieutenant Regt. Q. M. Sixty-fourth Ohio Vol. Infantry.
