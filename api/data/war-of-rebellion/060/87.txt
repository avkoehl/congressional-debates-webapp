HEADQUARTERS, January 20, 1864.

[Major General W. H. C. WHITING:]

GENERAL: An attack on New Berne is contemplated by the forces under command of General Pickett. The time will be between 25th and 30th instant. I request you will give all the assistance in your power, threatening simultaneously with your troops north of the Cape Fear the enemy's positions, so as to prevent their re-enforcing New Berne. General Pickett will telegraph you the day, by which you will know what is meant. Commit nothing to the telegraph on the subject. Keep the matter secret.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.
