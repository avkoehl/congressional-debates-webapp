to be sent to report to Colonel Jackson at Harper's Ferry. I desire two regiments more, if efficient men can be obtained, to be sent to the same point as soon as practicable. Report what troops will have been sent in compliance with these orders, composition, arms, &amp;c., and under what officers. The detachment may be composed of Virginia or Confederate State troops, as you may deem best for the occasion.

Very respectfully, &c.,

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN ECHOLS, Virginia Volunteers, Staunton, Va.:

COLONEL: It is desired that you send the troops you were directed to muster into the service of the State at Staunton to Harper's Ferry, by companies, as fast as mustered in, with their descriptive list, to Colonel Jackson, without waiting to organize them into regiments, with such arms as they may have. You will report the companies sent, their number, condition of arms, &c., to these headquarters.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEO. H. TERRETT,

Provisional Army of Virginia, Alexandria, Va.:

COLONEL: In forwarding Special Orders, Numbers 39, I take occasion to say that, while pursuing a strictly defensive policy, it is necessary that you should be vigilant, have your troops at or near points where they may be needed, and urge forward their instruction and preparation will all the means in your power. For this purpose it will be necessary to remove them from the towns, if possible, and establish them in camps, where their constant instruction and discipline can be attended to. They will the sooner become familiar with the necessities of service, and be better prepared for its hardships. It will be impossible to furnish tents at this time, but it is hoped that unoccupied buildings or temporary plank huts might be obtained where needed. At Manassas Junction, where it will be necessary to establish a portion of your command to secure the road to Harper's Ferry, some preparation of this sort will be needed. Colonel Garland's and Colonel Preston's battalions (the first consisting of four and the second of seven companies) have been ordered to that point, to report to you. These battalions will be increased to regiments as companies from their districts arrive, which will be forwarded to you by Colonel Cocke. You will give them the necessary orders and add such re-enforcements as you think proper. The troops near Alexandria will be kept in readiness to move whenever necessary, will afford such protection to the town and neighborhood as their number will permit, and you will endeavor to take measures to allay unnecessary excitement, and not to provoke aggression.
