Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you occupy the attention of the enemy in your front to-night and to-morrow morning by skirmishing and artillery, so as to prevent his massing upon Major-Generals Schofield and McPherson who are to attack his left flank. It is not intended that your operations shall amount in the aggregate to anything like a battle, but hat yo make use of any means that may occur to you as best calculated to accomplish the object intended without really attacking him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.

(Same to Palmer and Hooker.)

Brigadier-General NEWTON,

Commanding Second Division;

It has been discovered that the enemy's right is nearer General Stanley's left than was supposed this afternoon. Also General Stanley will make a strong demonstration for the purpose of attracting the attention of the enemy at daybreak to-morrow. You will therefore move your division directly forward at daybreak to-morrow, close to Colonel Taylor's brigade (General Stanley's rear brigade). General Wood will be ordered to close up on you.

By order of Major-General Howard:

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Near Marietta, July 3, 1864.

Reports that he left the Federal lines 30th June. Had instructions to visit along the river between the bridge and Baker's Ferry and ascertain if the rebels had any pontoon across the same. The first day I reached Powder Springs, next day reached Marietta, crossing Sweet Water Creek, at the mouth on the ferry. Reported to Colonel Hill, provost-marshal-general, rebel army, staid there till next morning, and then started for the river. When I got back as far as Ruff's Station, four miles below Marietta, I discovered they were running their train off, and the army was about to fall back. I concluded to come back and report the same. Started back immediately by way of Dobbins'
