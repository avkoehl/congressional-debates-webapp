WILMINGTON, January 13, 1865-8.30 a. m.

His Excellency Governor VANCE,

The enemy's fleet recuperate last night. It will be prudent to reassemble your State forces, and especially do I desire General Leventhorpe back with General Baker. The enemy would not return without the means and the will for a desperate effort.
