NEW ORLEANS, LA.,

July 27, 1863

SIR; I have the honor to report to you the following signal duty as having been performed by me since the 24th of May, 1863:

May 24, I was ordered by Lieutenant Hallett, commanding detachment at Baton Rouge, to report to Springfield Landing without delay. I proceeded from there to the headquarters of General Augur, and was then ordered by Lieutenant Hallett to report to Acting Brigadier-General Dudley's headquarters for duty.

June 1, having opened communication with the headquarters of General Augur, sent the following messages:

JUNE 1.

General AUGUR;

Please ask Captain Holcomb the range of the three last spherical case shots I fired after I received his message.

DUDLEY,

Colonel.

JUNE 1.

Colonel DUDLEY:

I did not see them.

HOLCOMB,

Captain.

Was now ordered by Lieutenant Hallett to build a station on Griffith's plantation, on a line of communication between the headquarters of General Banks and the U. S. sloop of war Richmond.

JUNE 4.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The enemy number their water batteries 1,2, &amp;c., from up-river down. The magazine is behind battery Numbers 6,500 yards back from the river.

N. P. BANKS,

JUNE 6.

General BANKS:

I have got the enemy under my control. The minute he opens, I silence him. I am glad I hurt him.

D. G. FARRAGUT.

JUNE 9.

General BANKS:

Hammering and building is reported at the mouth of Thompson's Creek. Can you account for it?

D. G. FARRAGUT.
