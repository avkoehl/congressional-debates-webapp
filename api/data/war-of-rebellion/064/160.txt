assisted by the gun-boats on the flank. This force foots up to 18,000, which is the minimum, in my opinion, for the defense of New Orleans and the river, including the occupation of the territory already under our control.

This plan does not involve the abandonment of any positions now occupied by our troops, and I do not consider that any of these positions can be abandoned unless all the troops are withdrawn to the line of the Mississippi. In this case the troops on the west bank of the river should be posted in strong redoubts at suitable points along the river, where they could receive the maximum assistance from the navy. The garrisons of these works should number about 800 each. These works, being strong enough to resist any sudden assault, will serve as a rendezvous for our fleet, and enable re-enforcements to be promptly landed at the threatened point. The main force should be posted on the right bank of the river opposite New Orleans, to prevent the occupation of that position by the enemy. The total force might thus be reduced to 12,000 men. Id in addition to these garrisons, a movable force is organized which can be readily thrown by transports to any point, the problem of holding the river will be solved in the most economical manner possible.

In regard to the positions held on the coast, Fort Pickens and Barrancas require a garrison of 2,000 men. These may be colored troops.

Fort at Ship Island.-This fort is not armed, except with a few naval guns temporarily in position. There is a colored regiment at this post, which is sufficient. The work should be armed as soon as possible, as the position is an important one in view of foreign complications. The casemate tier is ready for its guns. The permanent works in Louisiana are in good order and improvements are being made.

Pass Cavallo, Tex.-This is a point of great importance with reference to future operations, and should be held if the troops can possibly be spared. The garrison now is, I am informed, about 2,500 men. They should be able to maintain their position, which is on an island. The position is intrenched, though originally for a large force.

Brazos Santiago and Brownsville.-These points may be of great importance to us in case of a foreign war or subsequent operations with the rebels, and, like other inlets on the Texas coast, they are very difficult to take if held by the enemy. I consider the harbor of Brazos a very important one in the present position of affairs, and I would recommend the construction of a permanent work for a garrison of 800 men on Brazos Island. This work should command the entrance to the harbor and be strong enough on the land side to require a siege.
