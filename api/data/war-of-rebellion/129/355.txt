Papers E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, and N, hereto attached, exhibit the various operations of the conscript service in the diverse functions allotted to it. From these, however, are excluded an immense mass of work which it is not deemed necessary to report, because it is of a character not demanding record in this Bureau.

The returns furnished are unavoidably incomplete, and I respectfully refer to the latter portion of this report for the explanation.

Papers O and P will exhibit very valuable reports from Colonel Blake, the registrar of this Bureau, in regard to the military capabilities of Georgia and Virginia. * Within a few days I expect to receive from the same intelligent and zealous officer similar reports on North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama.

Paper Q is a list of the enrolling officers whose commissions have been vacated. * The case is fully stated below.

These various exhibits show that much good work has been done, although the numbers recorded in this Bureau do not manifest a large increase to the Army. A rigid and universal inspection, not only of company rolls, but personal and also pay rolls, will prove that more men have been received into the service irregularly since the 1st of January than have gone through the conscription authorities. The results of conscription since the 1st of January have not been equal to the anticipations of the country, and, perhaps, not quite up to the calculations of this Bureau.

I. The act of Congress entitled "An act to put an end to the exemption from military service of those who have heretofore furnished substitutes" (approved January 5, 1864), has not furnished the number of men which it was supposed would be brought into the service by that law. It has been found that a number of persons having substitutes come within the classes exempted by the act of February 17, 1864, and other large numbers belong to those classes who are the subjects of detail for the industrial productions. Wealthy farmers, enterprising manufacturers, and mechanics were the persons chiefly furnishing substitutes. Besides these many patriotic persons of feeble health, but within the conditions of the regulations, sent in substitutes, and on being enrolled have been detailed for service out of the field. The Bureau under your instruction, have been very cautious in allowing such details. I regret to state that there seems to have been a general effort to keep principals of substitutes out of the Army.

It is proper to add that the calculation of enrolling officers is, that a larger number of this class have gone into the Army without reporting to the enrolling officers than have been passed by them through the camps. The result of the law, therefore, has been better than is exhibited by the records of this B is has been found exceedingly difficult to interpret the "act to organize to just administration under the agencies provided for conscription. The purpose of the law seems to be that while all men are made liable to military service the productive industry must be maintained as necessary to the public defense. Under the classes of exemption there are but a limited number engaged in production. Of persons " owning fifteen able-bodied hands" a very small minority produce more than they consume, rarely having a surplus of grain or meat to sell, and a large majority of such persons between the ages of seventeen and fifty are already in the service.
