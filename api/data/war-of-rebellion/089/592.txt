HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Va., November 10, November 10, 1864.

Major-General WEITZEL:

Graham will have on his Bermuda line 4,000 infantry. Of course he could be re-enforced from your left much more readily than from elsewhere. Would it not be well for you to re-enforce him at once on hearing sufficient fire to denote as serious attack, and then I could re-enforce you. I shall have a brigade of Cavalry in reserve to send speedily there or elsewhere in case of need. Not counting horse-holders they will have 600 breech-loading rifles. Ames will from a reserve of 4,000 men ready to move at reveille to-morrow morning.

A. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
