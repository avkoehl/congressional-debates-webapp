After passing the second line we came upon Flint River, which at that point runs through a dense swamp. Here it was intended that we should halt, but as the brigade on our left kept going forward, our men also (though our line was much broken by the passage through the swamp) pushed up on a hill and through an open field to the enemy's third position. Here we halted and reformed our line, and the order having been given by the division commander, retired across the Flint. Our loss in the charge was slight-only 10 men wounded. That night we were withdrawn to the right of the army, and relieved General Stevenson's division just before daylight on the morning of the 1st. Our new line was not a good one; it was imperfectly laid out and only partially completed, and the enemy and gotten so close onto it that in sending out our pickets to relieve General Stevenson's pickets, some 33 of our men were captured. As daylight came on we were much annoyed by sharpshooters. In the afternoon a line of battle appeared in our front, but beyond opening a brisk fire upon our skirmish line, made no other demonstration.

The brigade took no other part in the fight of the 1st, though our lesson that day amounted to 61 in killed, wounded, and captured.

My officers and men have all behaved with gallantry, and deserve praise due to brave men.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. H. OLMSTEAD,

Colonel, Commanding Mercer's Brigade.

Captain PALMER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
