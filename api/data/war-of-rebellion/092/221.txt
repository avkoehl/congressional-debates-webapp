SURGEON'S OFFICE, Savannah, Ga., December 31, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to make the following report of First Division, Twentieth Army Corps, during the campaign and siege of Savannah, commencing at Atlanta, Ga., November 15, and closing with the capture of the city of Savannah, Ga., December 21, 1864, embracing a period of thirty-seven days:

The Twentieth Corps formed the right of the Left Wing of the Army of Georgia. The division was commanded by Brigadier General N. J. Jackson, and was composed of three brigades, commanded respectively by- First Brigade (four regiments), Colonel J. L. Selfridge, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers; Second Brigade (five regiments), Colonel E. A. Carman, Thirteenth New Jersey Volunteers; Third Brigade (six regiments), Colonel J. S. Robinson, Eighty-second Ohio Volunteers, giving a total present strength of 5,829. (See Appendix, Table I*) The men were generally in good condition, having had for some weeks the advantage of foraging expeditions, and were well clothed before leaving Atlanta, having received issues of new clothing. There were in the command about 300 recruits. The transportation of the division comprised 177 six-mule army wagons, thirty-eight of which carried ammunition. The transportation of the division hospital consisted of three army wagons and one medicine wagon, carrying sixteen ten-flies and the usual monthly allowance of the most useful medical supplies The transportation for the sick and wounded consisted of thirty-two mule ambulances, under the supervision of a captain and one lieutenant from each brigade, to which were added, near the close of the march, three army wagons for carrying knapsacks and equipments of men in regiment-such cases as were not proper for hospital and who would return to the regiment at night. The supplies consisted of twelve days' rations of hard bread, fifteen days' rations of coffee, fifteen days' rations of sugar, sixty days' rations, of last, and one days' ration of salt meat. The ambulances carried 200 pounds of hard bread for the hospital, which was much needed after the commissary's supply was exhausted and before the communication was opened with the fleet; also, a quantity of beef essence. The sick and wounded of the command had been mainly sent to the rear before we left Atlanta, the credit for which is partly due to the foresight and energy of Surgeon Kittoe, medical inspector, U. S. Army. The hospital report of November 15 showed but one remaining. There were at the same date fifty-one in the regiments excused from duty. (See Table I. *) On the march men were admitted to ambulance or hospital with passes signed by the regiment medical officers. (See Form, Table IIIa. *) One medical officer of the hospital corps and one steward accompanied the ambulance train each duty day to regulate admissions and attend to the wants of the sick. The number of sick and wounded admitted to hospital during the campaign was: (see Table IV#; also list of casualties.) At the close of the siege the number in hospital was only 1 per cent. of the command. The regiments were supplied in most cases with a packmule and a pannier set to each, and no regiment in the command was
