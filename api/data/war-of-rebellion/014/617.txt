HEADQUARTERS, June 26, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,Secretary of War:

SIR: I have directed General Holmes to be prepared to move his whole movable force to the support of the defenses around Richmond if called for. General J. G. Walker, at Drewry's Bluff, has been specially instructed also to the same effect. General Wise's brigade is retained in observation at Chaffin's Bluff. Colonel Rhett has been arming and preparing the troops in the batteries for an emergency in the field. Colonel Ransom's regiment in already with General Huger. I request that you will give any orders that the emergency may require. I shall be found on the Mechanicsville turnpike, or farther, according to events. I sent to President a copy of the general order of the day. I have not time to make another copy. He has also a copy of the signals to be given from the balloon.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

HEADQUARTERS OF DIVISION, ADVANCED LINES, WILLIAMSBURG ROAD, June 26, 1862-10 p. m.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,Secretary of War:

SIR: I send inclosed a letter just received from General Lee. I am holding my lines, but my men are much exhausted by yesterday's and last night's work. If there is no prospect of an attack at Drewry's I beg you will send the troops from there to re-enforce this line; at all events please send me the two regiments of my division now there, the Fifty-seventh Virginia and Thirty-second North Carolina, left at Drewry's Bluff. My force here is, as you know, not sufficient to stand long an attack in force, and I have no supports.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS, June 26, 1862.

Major General B. HUGER,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Hold your trenches to-night at the point of the bayonet if necessary. If you discover demonstrations against you and do not feel strong enough, call upon Colonel Rhett for his battalion of infantry armed with muskets. Should there be no indications of the enemy on James River, call on General Wise for such as he can spare. If the enemy should press you and this does not give you force enough, send to the Secretary of War to order Walker's brigade from Drewry's Bluff to join you, if only for to-night.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
