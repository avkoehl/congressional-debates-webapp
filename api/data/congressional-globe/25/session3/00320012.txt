December 5,
tures, a question naturally arises as to what items
it should first be applied The Depaitment
would not be understood as urging retrenchment
or parsimony, where the object is great, press
ing, and constitutional It has always approved
not only those appropriations which are neces-
sary to satisfy the ordinary wants of the public
service, ard others rendered proper to vindicate
our rights and national chatacter in war, but
those which our unexampled increase in territo-
ry, numbers, and wealth, may have requned, in
order at all times to afford due protection to per-
sons and property abroad, as well as at home,
and dischaige with efficiency all those moment-
ous duties which have been clearly and wisely
devolved on the Government of the Union. Á

the   ¡sinking  eontiast between  tne  state   of   the
eountiy in 1814, and its condition 111 ]Mj7, in le
cove iing from the suspensions of specie p lynidits
which inclined in those yeais, furnish s so in
sttucuvealessoiionthesubjectsbcfo 1 mentioned,
as to justify and lcquir*. a few details 111 comiec
tion with them
At the foimer peuod, there weie omy about
sevi nteen millions of specie in the United Stites,
tthetbei m banks 01 m ictive c rcula ion This
sum would aveia,e but two dolíais to each indi
vidual of oui population i tint time Sm-ill bills
Weie lee livable m almost eveiy S „te and by the
Genual Givunuicnt Such being the amount
i'f specie and the condition of ti e cunency, the
Gove nncnt felt compelled to act.uitsce in the
impolitic, as well as unjust, reception of depie
c - d pajiei of all kinds ten public dues, and the
susi ns on of specie ¡laymcnts, always calami-
tous however shoit, was piotiacted neaily tlnee
yi ais It was then terminated only by gieat jiei-
sonal sieiificts, by numen us insolvencies, and,
as imny hivi supposed, oy the cooperation of a
new nati 111a! bank, which its fi lends established
under the belief ot its utility, if not necessity, to
effect the iccomplislimeiH of that object
But, in 1837, the condition of thecuirency had
become mateually changed     There weie about
eighty millions of specie in the country, equal to
about five dollars per head of out population, 01
moie than double the former average
It had been thus mcieased, principally, by the
firm and persevering pohcy of the General Gov
ernment, during the last four years, to discourage
the use of small notes, and introduce gold more
extensively into the currency
In this state of things, the public officers at
once declined to violate the laws and countenance
partiality among debtors, by receiving depre-
ciated paper, and that of very different values,
for public dues Without hesitation, they also
refused unjustly to abandon the specie standaid
of value, eithei as to payments or receipts, and
hence sustained, throughout, both that standard
and the uniformity in imposts so wisely estab-
lished by the Constitution
This step tended stiongly to encourage a re
sumption of specie payments,and,iri consequence
of it, and of othei measures about to be explained,
the suspension, though it was more general than
the former one, ceased in some places within less
than a year, and has already ended m mostpaits
of the Union without any aid fiom the danger
ous and oveishadowing influence of a ¡National
Rank The essential diffeience in the couise
which the public offieeis weie able to puisue, as
to the kind of money ieceived, and the eaiher
peuod and gieater ease of resuming specie pay-
ments, bear no unequivocal testimony to the wis-
dom of the policy which had previously been
adopted in lelation to the improvement of the cur
rem y
It is behe\ed that about seven hundred banks
and branches, situated in twenty two Stites and
Tendones, have already lesurned specie piy-
ments lliese, including not fai fiom thirty
which nevei suspended, make seven hundied and
tlmty now pay ing specie Seventy moie are ex-
pei ted to 11 sume on or before the first of the en-
suing month Of the residue, amounting to about
twi nty five, with a capital of from three to foul
mil ions, it is believed that six 01 eight arc wind
ing up their concerns, because unpiofitable, and
that the rest aie insolvent
Soon aftei the suspens on, this Depaitment
uiged the deposit banks to use their utmost efforts
to lesume specie payments at an caWy day
It was piessed that each, as an act of sound pon-
ey, no less thanof strongn oral obligation and im-
perative duty under the law s, should resume specie
paj inents the moment it was able safely to effect
them, 01, at least, that all the banks intaiticu-
111 ncighboihoods, cities, counties, and States,
should unite in doing this, when vei alie, with-
out waiting foi weaker institutions, 01 moie em
bauasspd legions of the country
Die idoption of that course 111 some States,
I owever much the measuie was questioned at the
time, and persevcnno-ly opposed by many banks
as well as infuentidl individuals, has pioved for-
tunate, and icnWs gieat ciedit on the sagacity,
fiii rnn ss, and nite'ngcnce of those who adopted
it TI e encou agement given by the Department
to su h 111st unions as resumed specie payments,
by tiking no papei but tliens foi public dues, and
by |)ieierung them 111 the t ansaction of public
business, was 1 ot without silutaiy influence
Suits ao-euist the banks in default, unless appi-
lcntly insolvent, were iUo foibome, and diafts
continueu, with great idvantag , to be issued
giadually on ill that were disp is d to make sat-
lsfactoiy ariangemcnts with tne public cieditoi--,
and thus lessen those laigc immediate liabilities
winch stood in the way of eaily «sumption
Indeed, every facility was piomised and ex
tended which the limited powei ot the Di put
ment pmmtied, and, on its lecomniendanon, fui-
thei measuies of reasouibe indulgence to the
merchants and oanksindeuted to the Goveinmint
ieceived the prompt a tention of Congnss, and,
doubtless, contnbuted much to shorten the sus
pension
Undei the laws granting such indulgence, the
aggregate of met chants' bonds, th piyment 1 f
which was postponed,is supposedto have rcae lied
between four and five million dolíais lhe chief
benefit of this measuie was felt in the Atlantic
section of the country, while a similai extent of
relief was experienced piinctpilly in the west
and southwest by the allowance to the banks of a
long delay in paying the balances due fiom them
