JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Information induces me to look for early renewal of attack by enemy's iron-clads and of strong diversion with his land forces from direction of Bull's Bay or Mount Pleasant. I cannot safely withdraw more troops from Savannah or Pocotaligo, and am constrained to ask for that brigade from North Carolina soon as possible.

Walker's command, including batteries, except one regiment, in readiness for movement at a moment's notice to Mount Pleasant, with three days' provisions. At the same time have Colquitt's regiment held ready likewise to move to the same point.

It is the desire of the commanding general that this order should be given to the troops in question as soon as possible.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
