EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the

municating, in obedience to law, inventories of
the property of the United States in the pos-
session of the War Department; which was
ordered to lie on the table, and be printed.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. SHERMAN. I present the memorial
of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of
Cincinnati, setting forth atconsiderable length
and some detail that the bridge now being
constructed between that city and Newport,
Kentucky, is likely to be a very serious ob-
struction to the navigation of the Ohio river.
They state that under a fair construction of
the law the bridge ought to be one hundred
feet above low-water mark and forty f'eetabove
high-water mark, but that the company are
now erecting a structure at an elevation of
about fifteen or sixteen feet above high-water
mark, which they say will close, at the most
important navigable season of the year, that
important river. They askforthe prompt and
early action of Congress, requiringthe railroad
company interested in building this bridge to
elevate the piers and raise the superstructure
about thirty feet. This is a subject which is
exciting a good deal of interest in that region
of couutry, and it demands prompt action at
the hands of Congress. I shall ask that the
memorial be referred at the propertime either
to the Committee on Commerce or to the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads; I do
not know to which committee it ought strictly
to go.
The VICE PRESIDENT. To which com-
mittee does the Senator desire it to be re-
ferred ?
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not see the chairmen
of those two committees in the Chamber. I
will let the question of reference stand over for
the present.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator will
suggest to the Secretary hereafter the commit-
tee to which he desires the memorial referred.
It will lie on the table for the present.
Mr. SHERMAN. As the memorial contains
a number of important facts on the subject, I
move that it be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SAWYER presented the petition of P.
V. Dibble, of Orangeburg, South Carolina,
praying for the removal of his political dis-
abilities ; which was ordered to lie on the table.
He also presented the petition of Thomas
Black, of Charleston, South Carolina, pray-
ing for compensation for property taken and
destroyed by the United States Army; which
was ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. HARLAN. I present a memorial from
, the Board of Trade of the city of Dubuque,
i State of iowa, representing that the north-
ern branch of the Union Pacific railroad was-'
diverted from the line contemplated by Con-,
gress at the time of the passage of the law on
that subject, and also representing that a very ,
large district of country lying between the ;
Union Pacific railroad and the supposed tract
of the Northern Pacific railroad will be entirely -
destitute of railroad facilities; that this is a very â– 
valuable territory, bearing immense forests of
timber and great deposits of coal and other -
minerals of great value; and they deem that it
will advance the interests of the country very
much if another road should be constructed
between the line of the two roads named ; and
they pray that a grant of land be made to
facilitate that object. I move that this memo-
rial lie on the table for the present, to go to
the Committee on the Pacific Railroad when
the committees shall be formed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ABBOTT. I present a petition of citi-
zens of Wilmington, North Carolina, very
numerously signed, asking an appropriation
for the erection of a building for a post office,
custom-house, and United States district court-
room in that place, reciting that the present
building is totally unfit. Attached to this peti- '
t.ion are resolutions of the board of aldermen
of the city of Wilmington and the presentment
of the grand jury of the district court recently
held there condemning the building, and which
is indorsed by his honor Judge Brooke, the
presiding judge. I move that the petition and
resolutions be referred to the Committee on
Post Offices and Post Roads when it shall be
appointed.
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. The papers will
lie on the table for the present.
Mr. ABBOTT also presented the petition of
A. M. Noble, of Johnston county, North Caro-
lina, praying for the removal of his political
disabilities ; which was ordered to lie on the
table.
He also presented a petition of D. R. Ben-
nett, and others, praying for the establishment
of a mail route from Smithville, North Caro-
lina, to Little Iiiver, South Carolina; which
was ordered to lie on the table.
