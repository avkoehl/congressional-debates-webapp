THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

bangs in the. Senate, requesting the Secretary
of the Interior to suspend his order restoring
jo private entry the lands of the Southern Pa-
cific -Railway Company, in the Tulare valley,
until Congress could so legislate as to dedicate
these,lands to settlers only. Some years ago
a grantrWas made to that company, and they
fijed their map, j but the route indicated in their
Hjap was not justified by their charter. There-
fore it was'held by the Interior Department—
and very properly held, I think—that these
lands must be restored. But how were they
,to be restored? Why, under this system of
private entry, which would allow the specu-
lators who had already absorbed six million
acres in that valley to absorb the rest to the
exfent of a million acres; for they were all
ready with their descriptions and their rolls of
greenbacks to go in there in advance of the
settlers who would pour in if the lands were
held open only to homestead and preemption
entry,' and thus this million acres would be
added to the vast domain already absorbed by
these speculators.
Now, sir, this illustrates the condition of our
State inthatr.espect. Itisablightto ourpros-
perity, 'a continual curse, turning away the
high tides of an immigration that else would
gain homes in" our midst. I think there ought
to be a law passed applying to the whole of the
United States prohibiting hereafter all entries
of land under private entry. In view of the
rapid settlement of the public lands of the
United States we ought to preserve the rem-
nant left to us for the actual settlers. When
a man loads up his family and household goods
in a wagon and starts oh his weary journey
across the plains, when he reaches the West
or California, let there be some small piece of
land that he can buy of the Government itself,
and not compel him to pay twenty-five or fifty
dollars an acre to some speculator for land
which he has bought for fifty cents an acre. I
believe this is necessary for other States as
well as for my own.
• Under the present system rich men can
afford to make these investments and absorb
all these vast areas of the puhWc lands. For
one I am determined to do what I can to break
vip a system which has worked so badly for my
own State and must have had such disastrous
effects elsewhere.
■ Mr. Chairman, I am very glad of the oppor-
tunity which has been afforded me, under what
1 consider a wise rule of this House allowing
general debate in Committee of the Whole, to
express the ideas which I have upon this sub-
ject. 1^ assure gentlemen that these matters
are of vital importance to, my own State, and
that I speak with, I believe, an intimate knowl-
edge of their wants. I went there with the
first tide of emigration ; I have seen that State
grow up to its present proportions; I have
known the difficulties with which we have strug-
gled there. There, where all the years of my
manhood have been passed, is my heart; I love
that people as I love those of my native State.
I beg of Congress that these measures may be
early considered and may be adopted. I assure
you that thereby you will have the gratitude of
a generous people, which has ever fulfilled its
obligations within the Union and which looks
to you for the passage of measures vitally
necessary for its prosperity.
UNITED STATES COURTS IN INDIANA.
Mr. KERR. Mr. Chairman, I have been
directed by the Committee on the Judiciary,
to whom was referred House bill No. 230, to
report it back to the House with a recom-
mendation that it pass. I beg the attention
of the House while I briefly state the reasons
which render proper and necessary the pas-
sage of this bill.
In the State of Indiana, under existing laws,
there are but two terms of the district and cir-
cuit courts of the United States held each year,
and they are both held at the capital. Indiana
is the fifth State in popular and representative
strength in the Union ; yet there are but five
States in the Union whose Federal court facili-
ties are not greater and whose terms of such
courts are not more numerous, and whose judi-
cial machinery is not more complete than those
of Indiana, and in each of those five States they
have just the same extent of Federal judicial
facilities that Indiana enjoys. Those five States
are Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,
and Minnesota, and the aggregate representa-
tion of those States in this House is but thir-
teen, while that of Indiana alone is eleven.
Every other State enjoys greatly superior judi-
cial advantages over Indiana. The extent of
the State in area, in wealth, in population, in
commerce, in admiralty and maritime business,
and in all the elements of prosperity and power
entitle it to a great enlargement of these advan-
tages.
I have prepared for the more specific inform-
ation of the House, a careful table showing the
extent and organization of the judicial system
of the United States in the different States of
the Union. It is compiled from the,different
statutes now in force for the organization of
courts, and is believed to be absolutely correct.
It indicates very forcibly and clearly the sin-
gular insufficiency of our facilities in Indiana
and the very remarkable inequality which in
this respect exists between it and all the other
States. The committee very justly conclude
that this condition demands a speedy remedy
and that this bill ought to pass. The table is
as follows:

The insufficiency of Federal judicial facilities
in Indiana may be made still more impressive
by a brief reference to a few recent events.
Our complicated systems of internal revenue
taxation and bankruptcy, with their numerous
fines, penalties, forfeitures, and punishments
are of recent origin, and all seek judicial con-
struction and enforcement in the courts of the
United States. To them have been from time
to time added many laws of Congress for the in-
demnification of certain classes of persons from
punishment for certain offenses and wrongs
committed during the war under color of au-
thority. _ All such laws tend to increase the
jurisdiction of the same courts. The numerous
cases arising under them are taken out of the
State courts by transfer upon petition or writ of
error or mandate. The business of the same
courts has been further very greatly extended
and complicated by recent decisions of the
Supreme Court of the TJiuted States touching
their admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
This new jurisdiction is the r(e?,ujk ie"
cent legislation; unless it be legislation.
It is declared bv,the highest judicial tribunal
in the land to ejustand'tobe absolutely exclu-
sive in the Federal'coiirts. It vitally auecis
in an exceedingly important and somewhat
local sense the great interests of commerce as
carried on by the aid of the important natural
highways of the West. It affects some of the
most important interests of my own immediate
section and constituents. - Ihe entire southern
border of Indiana is washed by the Ohio river.
Upon its banks are several of'the most enter-
prising and prosperous cities in the State. Two
of these are in the district I have the honor to
represent, one just above and the other below
the falls of the Ohio. The material interests
and commerce of the people ofsouthern Indi-
ana, and especially from the,falls of the Ohio
westward and southward, are very largely con-
nected with that river. Our mechanics, who
are equal in intelligence, enterprise, and skill
to any in the country, are largely engaged in
the construction of steamboats and water-craft
of all kinds, including the floating palaces that
traverse the waters of all the navigable rivers
of the West and South. Other and not less
meritorious classes are engaged in the practical
management of, all such vessels as common
carriers of persons and'property, contributing
very greatly by their capita!, enterprise, and
intelligence to develop the material resources,
enlarge the commerce, and hasten the general
progress of the country.
Out of the extensive and diversified business
thus more or less directly connected with the
Ohio river innumerable and important con-
tracts and controversies arise, many of which
become the subjects of litigation. Heretofore
nearly all such litigation has found convenient
tribunals and speedy settlement in the courts
of the States. But now all such contracts and
controversies a3 are proper matters of admi-
ralty jurisdiction under late decisions of the
Supreme Court can only be litigated in the
Federal courts. Jurisdiction over them is de-
nied to the State courts and held to be abso-
lutely exclusive in the district courts of the
United States. Thus great numbers of suitors
are driven from the local courts to seek reme-
dies in remote Federal courts, or to give up all
remedy and suffer injustice. The Constitution
declares—
"Tho judicial power shall entend" * * *
* " to all cases of admiralty and maritimejurisdic-
tion."
The judiciary act of 1789 declares that—
" The district courts shall have, exclusively of the
courts of tho several States," * s s. *
cognizance of all civil causesof admiralty and mari-
time jurisdiction."
It will not be inappropriate here to inquire
briefly what is meant by the expression, " ad-
inirality and maritime jurisdiction." In its
most general sense it refers to that kind of
j unsdiction which at the common law was exer-
cised by certain courts over torts, contracts,
and offenses which arose or were committed
upon the high seas within the ebb and flow of
the tides and outside the body of any county.
It embraced the torts, contracts, and crimes
which are neoessariiy connected with and arise
out of that kmdof business and commerce which
is transacted upon the water aud lacks the ele-
ment of exclusive locality uponland, and there-
r!ffn 5?tj.e,r7ery nature, could not
be assigned for adjudication to the courts within
any prescribed territorial limits. Henoe, foi
