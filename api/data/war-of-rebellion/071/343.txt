Point of Rocks that the enemy crossed a large wagon train at Noland's Ferry on yesterday morning, followed by the enemy's cavalry and infantry. From all the information we can get, there is none of the enemy now anywhere in the neighborhood of the line of the road between Sandy Hook and Monocacy.

Colonel Chipman returns by train this a. m. to Baltimore. I hope you have received the desired definite information from the generals commanding.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.

(Via Monocacy. Received 8 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Captain Martindale, First New York Cavalry, of General Hunter's army, here on reconnaissance with sixty men, left Martinsburg Wednesday 11 a. m. General Crook had arrived at Cherry Run with his division. General Hunter was then at Cumberland, marching this way. He was without doubt at Martinsburg Thursday evening. Captain Martindale says the men are wearied and footsore; the cavalry much exhausted. I think your dispatches will get to General Hunter as soon as 6 o'clock this a. m., if Lieutenant Wyckoff gets along safely. If I can telegraph from Harper's Ferry I will send forward the cipher dispatch, following it myself. No enemy in this part of the State. When Captain Martindale left Martinsburg a force of 1,000 rebel cavalry were guarding a train of wagons, cattle, and plunder of all kinds, then at Winchester. He was too weak to feel or attack them.

N. P. CHIPMAN,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

HARPER'S FERRY, July 15, 1864-8 a. m.

(Received 10 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Hunter arrived here in advance this morning, 2 o'clock, and found your dispatches. General Sullivan was soon put in motion. He is now crossing the Potomac at Knoxville, 8,000 strong. He will strike for Aldie via Lovettsville, Hillsborough, and Purceville, subject to developments in front. General Crook will pass here with one brigade to-day, another to-morrow-together 4,000 strong. General Sullivan will report to General Wright till General Crook comes up.

N. P. CHIPMAN,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Sent cipher dispatch from Harper's Ferry. Last paragraph I am afraid is not clear. General Crook was signaled to come up in advance
