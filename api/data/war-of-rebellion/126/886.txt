From Governor Ellis, of North Carolina:

Your dispatch is received, and, if genuine--which its extraordinary character leads me to doubt--I have to say in reply that I regard the levy of troops made by the Administration for the purpose of subjugating the States of the South as in violation of the Constitution and a usurpation of power. I can be no party to this wicked violation of the laws of the country and to this war upon the liberties of a free people. You can get no troops from North Carolina. I will reply more in detail when your call is received by mail.

From Governor Magoffin, of Kentucky:

Your dispatch is received. In answer I say, emphatically, Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern States.

From Governor Harris, of Tennessee:

Tennessee will not furnish a single man for coercion, but 50,000, if necessary, for the defense of our rights or those of our Southern brethren.

Governor Jackson, of Missouri:

Your requisition is illegal, unconstitutional, revolutionary, inhuman, diabolical, and cannot be complied with.

From Governor Rector, of Arkansas:

None will be furnished. The demand is only adding insult to injury.

It may be interesting to state the fact that, notwithstanding the positive refusals contained in the foregoing replies to furnish troops for the Government service, the people of the States named furnished troops for the U. S. service as follows:*

Virginia (including what is now West Virginia) ........... 31,882

North Carolina ........................................... 4,358

Kentucky ................................................. 75,514

Tennessee ................................................ 29,727

Missouri (in addition to a large number of home guards,

Missouri State Militia) ..................................104,834

Arkansas ................................................. 5,472

"On the 9th day of the eighth month, in the year 1757, at night, orders came to the military officers in our county (Burlington) directing them to draft the militia and prepare a number of men to go as soldiers to the relief of the English at Fort William Henry, in New York government. A few days after there was a general review of the militia at Mount Holly, and a number of men chosen and sent off under some officers. Shortly after there came orders to draft three times as many, to hold themselves in readiness to march when fresh orders came; and on the 17th day of the eighth month there was a meeting of the military officers at Mount Holly, who agreed on a draft, and orders were sent to the men so chosen to meet their respective captains at set times and places--those in our township to meet at Mount Holly, amongst whom were a considerable number of our society. My mind being affected herewith, I had fresh opportunity to see and consider the advantage of living in the real substance of religion, where practice doth harmonize with principle. Among the officers are men of understanding, who have some regard to sincerity where they see it; and in the execution of their office, when they have
