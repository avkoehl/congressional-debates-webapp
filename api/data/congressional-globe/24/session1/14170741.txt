APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
741
24th Cong.... 1st Sess.
National Defense—Mr. Clayton.
Senate.
ftllow-citizens in one or the other House of Con-
gross can have no adequate conception, that this
pioposition was sprung upon the members of the
other House, and passed not only, as the gentle-
man says, w ithout time to discuss it, but without
time for any man to weigh it and consider it in
its most remote and mostalarmwg consequences.
The feeling which impelled gentlemen to this sud-
den and dangerous vote was, in general, doubt-
less patriotic Yet, even amidst the distracting
hurry of the scene of a last day's session, all men
of the party most devoted to the Executive in the
other House did not obey the impulse of feeling
and concur in that vote; and in this no less than
twenty-nine members, among whom were some
of all parties, rose, after but a few moments' re-
flection, against it. Nothing could have been
more unexpected. In confirmation of the remark
made by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, that
the President himself had not prepared any mem-
ber for it by asking him to move such proposition,
and of his further observation that there was no
time to discuss it, let me remind the members of
the last Senate of the manner in which, as I ob-
served at the time, we were routed at night out of
a secret session by a message from the House to
announce it. Sir, if a bomb shell had suddenly
exploded on the floor of the Senate, it could
scarcely have produced greater surprise and con-
sternation among those who were not in the con-
fidence of the Executive, nor acquainted with the
midnight movements and secret wishes of his
partisans.
It is in vain, sir, that the honorable gentlemen
who commenced this war on us by that vote, now
seek to find shelter from the storm of the attack
upon themselves, for their unconstitutional prop-
osition, by case-hunting through the whole mass
of congressional precedents for a single one to
sustain them. The statute-book does not present
a parallel to it. An appropriation of $2,000,000
"for pay and subsistence of troops, under an
act of 1806, authorizing the President to call out
the militia, and two large appropriations " for
foreign intercourse,"made in the years 1806 and
1808, the instances relied on by honorable gen-
tlemen as furnishing precedents for their votes,
are examples, not of general, but of specific appro-
priations, the objects being designated in the grant
of the money. [Mr. C here read these and other
acts, to show that the appropriations contained
in them were all of a specific character.] We
every year pass appropriations in the same words,
and the language thus applied is understood to
designate the objects for which our money shall
be expended, so that it cannot be applied to any
other purpose When Mr. Jefferson came into
office, he carried the doctrine for which I contend
so far as to recommend, in his message of the
8th of December, 1801, the " appropriation of
specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible
of definition, and it was this principle upon which
his disciples most plumed themselves as exhibit-
ing their scrupulous regard for the Constitution,
however those who now claimed to be his exclu-
sive followers have abandoned this great land-
mark of his party. The whole range of legislative
precedents, established by successive Congresses,
which supported his administration, and the sub-
sequent administrations of this Government, ac-
quired a character in consequence of the earnest-
ness with which the Demociatic party insisted
on the principle of specific appropriations, which
accounts at once for the failure of honorable gen-
tlemen, who now advocate the contrary doctune,
to find a single authority to support them.
Sir, another reason for their failure may also
be assigned. President Jackson, when he came
into office, professed to act upon the principle of
specific appropriations, as well as the other doc-
trines of Jefferson. In his inaugural address,
delivered on the 4th March, 1829, after pledging
himself to an economical administration, and the
counteraction of that profligacy caused by a pro-
fuse expenditure of the public money, he says-
"Pow< rful luxihanes to the attainment of this desirable
end are to be found in the regulation-! provided by the wis-
dom ol Congress lor the specific appropriation ot public
money "
And even in his message of the 7th December
last, he says-
" No one can be more deeply impressed than I am with
the soundness of the doctrine which restrains and limits,
by specific provisions, Executive discretion, as far as it can
be done consistently with the preservation of its constitu-
tional character "
He adds:
" The duty of the Legislature to define, by clear and pos-
itive enactment, the nature and pxtent ot the action which
it belongs to the Executive to superintend, springs out of a
policy analogous to that which enjoins upon all the branches
of the Federal Government an abstinence irom the exercise
of powers not clearly granted "
He afterwards again reiterates-
" The same rule of action should make the President ever
anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary authority
which con be regulated by Congress "
And in the next paragraph he says:
" in my former messages to Congress, I have repeatedly
urged the propriety of lessening the discretionary authority
lodged in the various Departments."
Sir, all these messages were looked to by his
partisans as the texts from which they were to
preach, and the creed on which their political
salvation depended. If they, having always had
the power to prevent, in the other House, the
passage of any law making an appropriation with-
out specification of object, could have produced
another example in which they had
" Kept the word of promise to the ear
But broke it to the hope,"
it would have been, indeed, but another melan-
choly commentary on the instability of all human
professions, and the utter worthlessness of that
sounding patriotism which explodes in party
pledges.
Indulge me in another question to the honor-
able gentlemen en the other side of the House.
Had this proposition been couched in such lan-
guage as would have authorized the President to
take ourplacesin this Chamber, and decide, while
we withdrew to give him the undisturbed use of
the room, how three millions of the public treas-
ure should be disbursed " for the naval and mil-
itary service," would aman among them have
acceded to it' Why not' Had such a proposi-
tion been adopted, it would have been quite as
good an appropriation, quite as definite a specifi-
cation of the purposes for which the money should
be expended, and, in one most essential particu-
lar, such a proposition would have been greatly
preferable to that for which they voted, for, al-
though it would have exhibited less confidence in
the President than the vote they gave, which
allowed him to decide at any time within nine
months what should be done with the money, it
would have required of him to come here and tell
us at once to what uses the money should be ap-
propriated . We might have gone into the gallery
as quiet spectators of his exercise of the legislative
power, but we should have enjoyed the satisfac-
tion of hearing his decision at the tune; and, while
we yet hngeied in the Capitol, we could have
congratulated one another on the mode and man-
ner in which his wisdom had disposed of the
money. When we wended our way back to the
people, we could then have told them what was
to be done with their three millions, as, what
forts were to be built, and where they were to be
erected; what ships and what arms were wanted,
or what number of tioops should be raised for
their army This would have given the workmen
and contractois for pubhejobs among us an op-
portunity of entering into competition with the
Executive favorites, for then, havingsome chance
to know what was to be done, they could have
put in thei r bids for the public works to be erected.
I could have gone home rejoicing in my ability
to answer the earnest interrogations of my con-
stituents, whether Fort Delaware was to be re-
built, whether the breakwater was to be defended,
and whether frigates or gun-boats were to be used
in the Delawaie in the event of a war.
But honorable gentlemen will now perceive that
the vote they gave was a much more alarming
surrender of their legislative power. They yielded
up their trust, and gave the President, with it,
the privilege of keeping his intentions seen t until
the moment of expenditure, their only restriction
upon the period allowed for his exercise ot it
being, that he should spend it at some time " prior
to the next meeting of Congress," when, indeed,
upon their principle of confidence, they ought
again to have assembled, voted twenty millions
at once for the public seivice, to be expended by
the President " prior to the next meeting of Con-
gress," and adjourned without further expense to
the people Sir, I do solemnly denounce this
proposition, which the Senate alone resisted on
the last night of last session, as a measure in
principle no better than the regulations of Cali-
gula, who suspended his laws on pilláis so high
that men might not read them in the public ways
Even his laws might have been read by the aid
of ladders. But by what possible means could
that portion of the people who have no access to
the private ear of the Piesident have climbed to
the information of Ins plans of defense, during the
period for which he was to have been peimitted
to keep his purposes secret'
Viewing this proposed appropriation of three
millions, without restriction, specification, or lim-
itation as to objects other than the naval and mil-
itary service, as not only unconstitutional, but as
destructive of the first principles of representative
government, having considered and expressed his
solemn conviction, after a year's deliberation,
that it laid the foundation for the introduction of
dictatorial power in this Government, and con-
tained the very language in which a dictator might
be appointed under a pretense of some future
pressing emergency, the honorable gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr Webster,] in the
midst of a strain of fervid eloquence and indig-
nant remonstrance against this attempted outrage,
which has not been equaled in this debate, and
cannot be excelled, had declared—
<c If the proposition were now before un, and the guns of
the enemy were battering against the wills of the Capitol,
he would not agree to it, that the people of this country
have an interest, a property, an inheritance, in the Con
stitution, against the value of which forty Capitols do not
weigh the twentieth part of one poor scruple "
Taking authority for so doing fom another
part of the Capitol, I read the following remark,
as published in the National Intelligencer, in ref-
erence to this sentiment-
" Sir, for a man uttering«ueh sentiment", there uould be
but one step more, (a natural and eisy one to take ) and
that would be, with the enemy at the walls of the Capitol,
to join him in battering them down "
And he who published this, has also published
1 that when he uttered it, he "was íntenupted by a
spontaneous but st of feeling and applause "   But,
he adds, "the indiscretion was momentary, and
the moit respectful silence followed "
Sir, I pass over without notice the accountgiven
of "applause," and "aspontaneous burst of feel-
ing," and "indiscretion," and then "the most re-
spectful silence." Indeed, I know nothing of
these allegations, except as I find them here stated.
But, in regard to that denunciation of the senti-
ment of my honorable friend from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Webster,] who is this day elsewhere ne-
cessarily detained, and in reference to the particu-
lar individual who was the author of that denun-
ciation, I have something to say.
The opinion expressed in this denunciation is,
that it would be a natural and easy step for the
j Senator from Massachusetts to take, to join the
enemies of his country in war, in other words, to
turn tiaitoi,and meut by his treason the most
ignominious of all deaths, with an immortality of
infamy beyond the erave '
And for what' The Senator from Massachu-
setts had expressed a pieference for the Consti-
tution to the Capitol of his country. He had
dared to declare that he puzed the magna chai ta
of American liberty, the sacred bond of our Union,
the tie which binds together twelve millions of
fieemen, above the stones and mortar which
compose the crumbling mass within whose walls
we are assembled. " The very head and front
of his offending hath this extent—no more " No
man here has questioned, in the most violent
moments of party excitement—not amidst the
fieicestofall political strife—his purity of purpose
in debate Grant to him what all otheis who
have any title to the charactei of gentlemen de-
mand for themselves, that he believed what he
slid, grant that in his judgment, as well as that
of many hi re, the veiy existence of our liberties-
is involved in the surrender of the principle he
contended foi, giant that the concentration of
legislative and executive power in the hands of a
single man is the death-blow to the Constitution,
and that the Senatoi was right in considering the
proposed appropriation as establishing the very
