Brigadier-General BROWN,

Had I not better leave for Pleasant Hill to-day? I can safely take from Kansas City, Independence, Westport, and Hickman Mills from 100 to 150 mounted men.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 4, 1864-4 p.m.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Kansas City, Mo.:

You had best keep the troops at Independence, Kansas City, and Westport to operate against the enemy from that line, while you have a force in the vicinity of Pleasant Hill for the same purpose in case they move towards Kansas. Make arrangements to obtain information by the means of citizens, women, and boys, and save your troops, and keep them concentrated for more important movements. In case you learn of a concentration in Jackson County and the telegraph is cut, manage to get the information to our troops in the vicinity of Chapel Hill and Holden. The commanders are instructed to act with you and follow up vigorously any move of the enemy.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
