line of logs and rail works complete, and one partially constructed. The fire under which this was done was exceedingly heavy, and the artillery of the enemy, which was massed in large force and admirably posted, was served with a rapidity and fatal precision which could not be surpassed. The nature of the ground over which we passed was most unfavorable to such a movement-the two right brigades moved for much of the way over open fields, the two left through dense undergrowth. The line thus became more irregular and broken every moment, and when the two right brigades had driven the enemy into their main works the line was so much broken and mixed up that, although the men were in good spirits and perfectly willing to make the attempt, it was not deemed practicable to carry the works by assault. The command were halted and the best possible line, under the circumstances, formed. Brown's and Trigg's (Reynolds') brigades lay in a swampy ravine within pistol-shot of the enemy's works; the other two brigades held the road on their left. The dead and wounded were all removed to the rear, and after holding our position for several hours, in compliance with the orders of General Hood, the division returned to its old position. With perhaps some few exceptions the conduct of the troops was highly creditable.

My loss was heavy-807 killed and wounded. Among the killed were Cols. Ed. C. Cook, Thirty-second Tennessee, and C. H. Walker, Third Tennessee, both models of the Southern soldier and gentleman.

My thanks are due to Generals Cumming and Pettus, to the brigade commanders, and to my staff. Major J. P. Wilson, assistant adjutant-general, and Captain Coleman, engineer officer of the staff of Lieutenant-General Hood, were with the command, and I am under obligations to them for the assistance which they rendered.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON.
