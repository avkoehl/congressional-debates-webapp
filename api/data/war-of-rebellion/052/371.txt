HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,In Tennessee Valley, Poe's Tavern, September 5, 1863-8 a.m.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Clouds of dust and the general movements as observed from lookouts from the hills on this side of the river all day yesterday strongly indicated a general movement of the enemy in the direction of Tyner's Station. All possible vigilance and means of obtaining information are used; the whole line of the river from General Burnside's forces is carefully picketed. I am withdrawing Minty's left as rapidly as circumstances will permit, and am preparing boats that will be ready as soon as needed. Movements intended to deceive the enemy with regard to our forces have been made, I think, successfully. I can conceive of nothing that has been left undone contemplated by instructions or made necessary by circumstances. All further developments will be carefully noticed and promptly acted upon.

I am, very respectfully,

W. B. HAZEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully,
