Major-General WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

Lieutenant-Colonel Downey, commanding at Kearnesville, reports that he, with an escort of 20 men, encountered the enemy at Boonsborough, advancing to-day. He does not state whether in this direction or toward Hagerstown; probably, cannot tell. The enemy in considerable force. Colonel Downey and Captain Shamburg, commanding the escort, charged upon the enemy, who retreated in confusion, till they ascertained how small a force attacked them, and then turned upon our men, who were obliged, of course, to recede. Colonel Downey was wounded, though not severely.
