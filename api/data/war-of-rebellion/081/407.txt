General Barnard, through Colonel Porter, I at once sent an aide down in a steamer to bring it up, and I expect it to-morrow afternoon or evening, and will send them out to you at once, if you then wish them, of which please advise me.

General Wright reports that his sharpshooter officers report to him that a column of the enemy half a mile long is moving down the railroad. General Gibbon is instructed from these headquarters to hold himself ready to move to attack, as he may be thrown upon the enemy's flank, and to make himself acquainted with the roads leading from beyond our left toward the railroad.

The information received to the present time renders it probable that the force of the enemy moving down the railroad are covering the repair of the road where it was broken by our troops.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 25, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I sent up a prisoner just taken from Finegan's brigade, now with Perry's brigade, assigned to Hill's corps. He says the movement down the railroad was to meet the cavalry destroying it, and that they returned to the works. He seems to be an intelligent fellow.
