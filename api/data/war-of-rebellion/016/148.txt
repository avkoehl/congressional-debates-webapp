fought with a heroism hardly found in the record of war. The commander of the brigade was amongst the last of his command to leave the field. He subsequently collected the thinned regiments of the brigade in rear of its original position, and afterward by superior order took post for the night in rear of the re-enforcing column.

I inclose herewith a list of casualties in the division,* and a tabular statement of the number taken into action,+ showing a loss of 78 officers and 1,144 enlisted men, nearly one-third of the number engaged. This record is the strongest commendation that can be presented of the gallantry and good conduct of both officers and men. Among those reported missing some wounded probably have fallen into the hands of the enemy. Most of them, I regret to be compelled to believe, must be numbered with the killed.

Upon reoccupying the field of battle it was found necessary from the intense heat tom hurry the burials, and most of the dead were interred by details of men who did not know or could not recognize them.

I refer to the reports of commanders of brigades and regiments and to that of Captain Best,+ U. S. Army, chief of artillery, for further details of the action, as well as for such commendation of officers and men as especial instances of good conduct merited. The prompt, ready, and zealous co-operation of Generals Crawford and Gordon, commanding brigades, demand especial commendation.

I beg leave also to bring to the notice of the major-general commanding the corps the efficient and valuable aid my personal staff - Captain William D. Wilkins, assistant adjutant-general, who, I regret to add, was taken prisoner near the close of the action; of Captain E. C. Beman, commissary of subsistence; of First Lieutenant Samuel E. Pittman, aide-de-camp; of Captain B. W. Morgan, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, division provost-marshal and volunteer aide-all of whom were untiring in their efforts to forward promptly my orders. I desire also especially to bring to your notice the very valuable services of Surg. A. Chapel, division medical director. At the commencement of the action he selected and prepared as far as possible a general depot for the wounded at a house near General Gordon's position. At this depot were collected several hundred of our wounded, who received during the night the able professional services of Surgeon Chapel and his assistants, and early the following morning were carefully sent back to the hospitals in Culpeper. The prompt and judicious conduct of Surgeon Chapel has bee the subject of praise by officers and men.

Nor can I close my report without a reference to the sad record of the killed and wounded of the fields officers engaged. In the Twenty-eighth New York Volunteers, Crawford's brigade, Colonel Donnelly is mortally wounded, Lieutenant-Colonel Brown severely wounded Major, Cook severely and a prisoner. In the Forty-sixth Pennsylvania Colonel Knipe severely wounded, Lieutenant-Colonel Selfridge twice slightly, though not reported, Major Mathews severely. In the Fifth Connecticut Colonel Chapman wounded and a prisoner, Lieutenant-Colonel Stone dangerously and a prisoner, Major Blake wounded and a prisoner. In Gordon's brigade Lieutenant-Colonel Crane, Third Wisconsin, killed and Major Savage, Second Massachusetts, wounded and prisoner. More faithful and valuable officers no service can boast of. The loss, temporarily it is to be hoped in the cases of wounded and prisoners, will be severely left in the divisions. Of the subordinate officers who have fallen or suffered from wounds a record will be found in the reports
