of January, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, by virtue of an order from the President, promulgated by the Secretary of War in an order dated fifth of August, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, to be by the sub-agent delivered to the chiefs of the Seminoles, who were to decide the right of property in and to said slaves; and that this was done by a decree of the general council of the fifteenth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, by which decree all the slaves and their increase, having formerly belonged to King Payne, were decided to belong to and to be under the control of Micco Nut-cha-sa or Jem Jumper, the principal chief of the nation;

And it being also alleged by the Seminoles that the claims of the various owners of said slaves, so dispossessed of their property and deprived of the use of the same for three years or more, were made out before and filed with Marcellus Du Val, the sub-agent for the Seminoles, prior to the fifth of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four;
