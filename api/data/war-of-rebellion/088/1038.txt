Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,September 26, 1864-6 p. m. (Received 7 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

I find that the picket-line which General Mott desires me to relieve covers the front of Fort Davis and probably extends to the right front of it, and, besides, there is apparently no connection on the right of this line with that in front of Fort Sedgwick; or in other words, I am to relieve all on this side of the plank road. It may be that the location of the line is different from what can be observed from the front of Fort Davis. I have directed, however, General Mott's line to be relieved this p. m., but as the relief is to be taken from the Third Division (colored troops) I thought it best to let you know, so that your people in Fort Davis and on the right may be on the lookout, for, as these troops are all new, I cannot say how long they will hold on should the enemy advance with a yell.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 26, 1864.

General PARKE:

i particularly directed General Mott to-day to continue picketing a considerable distance to the left to the left of the plank road, and understood that the arrangement was that the should keep at least fifty posts on the left of the plank road. I will at once direct him not to relieve his line to the plank road, but to cover considerably to the left of Fort Davis.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 26, 1864.

General PARKE:

I have referred your telegram to General Mott, and the following is his answer:

I would not feel sage unless my now own picket-line covered the works I occupy, as the responsibility would not be felt properly, I think, by troops picketing another front than their own.

I prefer the picket-line now established by General Mott.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
