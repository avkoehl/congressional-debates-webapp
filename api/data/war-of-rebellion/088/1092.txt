HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 29, 1864-12 m.

General U. S. GRANT:

The following dispatch has just been received from Major Fisher, chief signal officer:

STATION NEAR FRIEND'S HOUSE,September 29, 1864-11.40 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

A column of troops numbering about 2,000 has just passed toward Richmond on a side road along the Richmond turnpike. Trains were moving upon the turnpike at the same time, and are still moving. At present a well closed up column is entering Petersburg at the cross-roads. There were at least 4,000 in this column; I did not see the head of it.

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.

General Meade has gone to General Warren's headquarters.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General MEADE:

Signal officer reports train of sixteen cars, heavily loaded with troops, from Petersburg to Richmond.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, September 29, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Re-enforcements are beginning to come from Petersburg. I doubt whether it will be advisable for you to make any advance this evening, but this I leave to your judgement. The works carried this morning are very formidable, equal to Warren's inclosed works. One that I was in had two 8 or 9 inch columbiads and a number of small rifle guns, besides one 100-pounder Parrott. Since writing the above I have received reports of large forces moving from Petersburg toward Richmond. If this continues it may be well for you attack this evening.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
