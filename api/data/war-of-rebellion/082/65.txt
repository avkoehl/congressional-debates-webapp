HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 7, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

We are getting along very well with our redoubts, but need more men and tools. I wish, if it can be done, that 600 men could be detailed with tools, picks, and shovels, from either the Sixth or Second Corps, to help us on the central redoubt under Captain Mendell. I work all the tools I have day and night. The man should begin work at 4 a. m.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

JULY 7, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Captain MENDELL:

If we can get a detail from another corps I wish to have them help on the large redoubt. General Griffin will prefer to finish the little one on the left. I have asked for a detail to report to you. I think Captain Gillespie better change the interior crest of the redoubt he has so that it will be only of the same thickness of parapet as the one you are building. There is a good road from headquarters direct to where I met you to-day.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1864.

G. H. MENDELL,Captain of Engineers.
