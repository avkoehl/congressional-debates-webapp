Major-General HALLECK,

Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose to you a synopsis from the reports of the 10th instant of the forces in and near Washington for its defence. I t is as near to the exact strength as "reports" will bring us. The aggregate is probably somewhat larger than the actual number of troops ready for duty.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-The number of guns reported is one hundred and twenty; forty of these are heavy guns in garrison. The balance is doubtless field artillery.
