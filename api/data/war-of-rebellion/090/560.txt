and Ohio road. If he moves across Ridge I will move directly across from this place to meet him, and I think I can defeat his infantry and thwart his movements on the east of the mountains. But what shall I do if he sends re-enforcements to Grant or remains in the lower Valley? He has laid waste nearly all of Rockingham and Shenandoah, and I will have to rely on August for my supplies, and they are not abundant there. Sheridan's purpose, under Grant's orders, has been to render the Valley untenable by our troops by destroying the supplies.

My infantry is now in good heart and condition, and I have sent a special messenger to you to get your views. Without Kershaw I would have about 6,000 muskets.

Very respectfully,

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia.

NEW MARKET, October 20, 1864. (Via Richmond.)

The Sixth and Nineteenth Corps have not left the Valley. I fought them both yesterday. I attacked Sheridan's camp on Cedar Creek before day yesterday morning, and surprised and routed the Eighth and Nineteenth Corps, and then drove the Sixth Corps beyond Middletown, capturing 18 pieces of artillery and 1,300 prisoners; but the enemy subsequently made a stand on the pike, and, in turn, attacked my line, and my left gave way, and the rest of the troops took a panic and could not be rallied, retreating in confusion. But for their bad conduct I should have defeated Sheridan's whole force. On the retreat back to Fisher's Hill the enemy captured about thirty pieces of artillery and some wagons and ambulances. The prisoners were brought off. My loss in men was not heavy. General Ramseur was seriously wounded while acting with gallantry, and was captured by the enemy.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEW MARKET, October 21, 1864.

My net loss in artillery on the 19th was twenty-three pieces. My loss in killed and wounded in less [than] 1,000. In the early part of the day it was not more than 100. I cannot say how many were captured, but I think very few. Many of the men scattered, and are still coming in. The enemy's infantry is very badly demoralized. My men ran without sufficient cause, and the capture of artillery, &amp;c., was made by the enemy's cavalry. The enemy is not pursuing; his loss was very severe. I have sent off over 1,300 prisoners.

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.
