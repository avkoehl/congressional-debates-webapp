NASHVILLE, May 30, 1864.

Brigadier General J. E. SMITH:

The detachment of 150 Indiana cavalry left here on train this morning. They are to relieve your troops between Decatur Junction and Huntsville on the railroad. Please have your command at the different points ready at the train to embark as the relieving force arrive. Four hundred and fifty men of Thirteenth Indiana Cavalry leave on train this morning for Huntsville. They are to constitute part of the Huntsville garrison. There are not any quartermasters of commissaries here to send to Huntsville. As soon as I can get officers I will send them to relieve the post commissary of subsistence and post assistant quartermaster. The militia that were to relieve Granger's brigade on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, which in its turn is to relieve you on the river and at Decatur, have been stopped at Louisville, and placed on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. This will delay your being relieved. I will push forward what forces I can as rapidly as possible.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
