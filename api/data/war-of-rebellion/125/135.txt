AUGUSTA, ME., February 25, 1864.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The Fourteenth Maine Regiment is here, having about one hundred men enlisted at New Orleans who have not served quite two years. These men are chiefly foreigners, and re-enlisted by direct orders of General Franklin, approved by General Banks. They are furloughed with the others-one of the privileges of re- enlistment. They re-enlisted under the inducement of $300 offered by Maine. This bounty they expect, and if not paid this State is disgraced, for it was promised them by our officers, and a mutinous spirit will be engendered which will virtually destroy the regiment. With their furloughs in their pockets escape to Canada is easy, and the Government will lose the service of these men for the rest of their term. I shall order the bounty paid, and shall expect that this State will have credit for the men. We cannot afford to be disgraced at home.

SAMUEL CONY,

Governor of Maine.

STATE OF RHODE ISLAND, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Providence, February 25, 1864.

Colonel JAMES B. Fry,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: Much to my surprise a communication reached me yesterday through the acting assistant provost-marshal-general for this State, informing us that though the State of Rhode Island has furnished largely more than her quota, the men so furnished had been so assigned to districts and sub-districts that a draft might be made in some towns.

I am more surprised at this, as I received a letter from you on the 21st of October, 1863, leaving the assignment entirely to me, and I then positively stated that I desired no subdivisions in this State, but stated distinctly that Rhode Island would furnish her quota, and she has done so and has some thousands in excess.
