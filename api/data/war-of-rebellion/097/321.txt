south of Hatcher's Run; that a portion of Pickett's division went up toward Lynchburg, but don't know if it remained there. Says the rebel rifle-pits are fifteen yards apart and five men in each; that the men go on once every three or four days. this would give a line of one man to the yard. General Michie corroborates the report as to distance and contents of their rifle-pits.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received deferring attack and to keep up preparations. Will do so.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865-10.58 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

If you have not already got it, have a road made across Hatcher's Run at your left near the Crow house, so that troops can be moved rapidly from your position to this side of the run. Also spread your troops out so as to have one division in reserve.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

I notified you some hours ago that the order for assault in the morning had been suspended.

U. S. GRANT,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

General Wright reports that he thinks he can assault at daylight in the morning with a good prospect of success. I had suspended the order, but authorized General Meade to direct him to make the preliminary preparations. Are your men so arranged as to enable you to assault at the same time? It will require the massing of your troops at point where you intend attacking. Answer, and I will give definite orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
