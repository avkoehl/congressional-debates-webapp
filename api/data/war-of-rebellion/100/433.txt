WILMINGTON, May 7, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Chief Justice Chase left Morehead City last evening and is expected here any hour. Your dispatch concerning the Stonewall is received and the instructions are being carried out. Those recruits were for the Fifty-third Indiana. They sail to-day in the steamer that brought Stonewall is so definite that it is best to retain them.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY,

Washington, D. C. ;

I have been ordered by General Sherman to occupy Augusta, Ga., and Orangeburg, S. C., and shall do so at once. A very great reduction in the infantry force of this department can be made at once, but I want some cavalry to protect my communications from guerrillas. General Schofield informs me that most of Joe Johnston's cavalry refused to surrender, and have started off south. I suppose they will scatter themselves over South Carolina and commit all sorts of depredations, particularly upon the colored people. Two thousand good cavalry would not be too much for this department for the next two months.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., May 7, 1865.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY,

Washington, D. C. ;

SIR: I have dispatches from Bvt. Major General J. H. Wilson of the 1st instant, from Macon, making requisitions for supplies to be sent by way of the Altamaha and Ocmulgee Rivers. All his command, some 15,000, strong, was at Macon. I have ordered a temporary depot to be established at Darien for supplying General Wilson's command, and shall send a light-draft river steam-boat for his use.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE

Major-General, Commanding.
