HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Abernathy's house is about one-fourth of a mile in front of Schofield's right center; Howard's troops overlap Schofield's right. I have directed Howard to send a division down the river to Pace's Ferry at daylight Thursday morning to cover the laying of the bridges at that place.

Major-General.

General THOMAS:

I understand that Howard has a pontoon bridge at Powers' Ferry.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The road from Powers' Ferry to Abernathy's house is said to be good. Howard has one bridge at Powers' Ferry, but I want to replace that by McPherson's bridge, as it will be nearer to his position, and Buell's at Pace's Ferry will be nearer to mine.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HDQRS. MILIARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 12, 1864.

General THOMAS:

You need not attempt the crossing at Pace's till I hear further of General Stoneman. The day after to-morrow will be soon enough. I heard of twenty men on foot armed, about four miles from Big Shanty, who questioned a negro as to the force at Marietta. Yet it is well that Colonel Gleason sent the regiment, as it will make it certain. The Fifteenth Corps will pass Marietta in the night for Roswell, and it seems impossible that any force should be near the place described. The brigade from Allatoona for Kenesaw should also be in position by to-morrow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, near Vining's Station, Ga., July 12, 1864.

Colonel G. P. BUELL,

Commanding Fifty-eighth Regiment Indiana Vols (Pontoniers):

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that as soon as Captain Kossak has laid a bridge at Powers' Ferry, that you take up your bridge, now at that place, and throw it across the river at Pace's
