THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 10,
House proceed to refer them to their appropriate
.committees.
Mr. LETCHER. I hope we shall get beyond
the Committee on Public Lands, of which the
gentleman [Mr. Cobb] is a member. I do not
want to stop at that committee, as I am anxious
to get to sowe other committees, which will not
occupy the whole balance of the session.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Call the next
committee.
Mr. COBB. I hope the gentleman will not
throw any reflection upon what I have done. We
are through with the call of committees, according
to the understanding this morning, and the Com-
mittee on Public Lands cannot be called until we
meet again.
The SPEAKER. In order that gentlemen may
understand each other, the Chair would state that
the order made by the unanimous consent of the
House this morning was, that the committees be
called, beginning with the Committee on the Poet
Office and Post Roads, and that such matter should
be reported as should give rise to no debate or vote,
and that the same should be referred; and that
when the Chair should again resume the call, he
should begin with the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads. The Committee on Pub-
lic Lands immediately precedes the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads. Therefore the
gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Cobb] is not more '
interested in the proposition which he hart made j
than any other member. !
If there is no objection, the bills on the Speak-
er's table will be disposed of in the same manner, 1
either generally, or if the House prefers, such as
relate only to private business.
Mr.STANTON,ofTennessee. I askthecon- j
sent of the House to make a report or two. They i
are not of any particular impoitance; but I was ;
not in the House at the time my committee was
called.
No objection was made.
On motion by Mr. STANTON, it was
Ordered, Tlmt thfi Committee on the Judiciary br* dis-
ehargeil fiom the Imther consideration of certain iiotttiona i
for the election of l'n'tmlent and Vice President tiy tin; peo-
ple, and that the same be refeired to lhe n'leet committee
on that subject appointed some lime since.
On motion by Mr. STANTON, it was
Ordered, That the Committee on the Jndieiaty be dis
charged from the (nither consideration of certain petitions
tor lhe election of" pos-tmasteii by the people, and that the
same he laid upon the table.
Mr. STANTON, from the Committee on the :
Judiciary, also reported bac.k u a Ull declaratory '
of the second section of an net of Congress up-!
proved February 3, 1853, entitled 4 An net to con-
tinue hftif pay to certain, widows and orphans.'
Mr. S. snid (he Committee on the Judiciary j
looked upon this bill as the ennctment of a new i
law upon the subjcct of pensions, which does not 1
come within the province of our committee; we
therefore ask to he discharged from the further :
consideration of the bill,and that it he referred to
the Committee on htvaitd Pensions.
The bill was ordered t<> be :jo referred.
Mr. STANTON, from the Committee on the
Judiciary, reported hack a joint resolution pro-
viding for the election of United States Senators
by the people; which was referred to the select
committee appointed to consider that subject.
Mr, S.jfrom the same committee, reported back
a biil entitled "An act for the more effectual pros- 11
ecution of land claims belonging to the United
States." **
Mr. S. said; 1 will otcrte to the House that this
bill is a proposition to purchase witnesses and
prosecutors by giving them a portion of the prop-
erty to be recovered. The Committee on the Ju- 1
diciary considered it to be one very improper and
injurious in its character. They have therefore
instructed me to report it back to the House, with
a recommendation that it do not pass. Ji move
that it be laid upon the table.
The motion was agreed to; and the hill ordered
to lie upon the table.
Mr. HAVEN. Some time .since I pave notice
of the introduction of a bill upon a subject o^ some
consequence. It involves the expenditure of no
money; and I now propose to throw myself upon
the well known indulgence of the House, and ask '
leave to introduce it, simply for the purpose of
having it referred to the Committee on Commerce, i
There was no objection; and the following bill i1
was introduced, read a first and second time by
its title, and referred to the Committee on Com-
merce:
A bill to amend the act entitled " An act to
provide for recording the conveyances of vessels,
and for other purposes," approved July 29,1850.
Mr. DRUM. Among the papers of the mem-
ber from Virginia, lately deceased, [Mr. Snod-
grass,] I find a bill and report from the Commit-
tee on Revolutionary Claims, of which he was a
member. I ask leave to present it and have it re-
! ferrred.
j There was no objection, and the fallowing bill
I was reported from the Committee on Revolution-
] ary Claims, read a first and second time by its
! title, referred to a Committee of the Whole House,
1 made the order of the day for to-morrow, and the
| bill and report ordered to be printed.

istrator of Captain John Davis, an officer in the

j ceededÂ«to take up and dispose of bills upon the

! Mr. COBB. I move to refer the bill to the
Committee on Public Lands, and that it be printed.

the Committee on Military Affairs. The bill was
