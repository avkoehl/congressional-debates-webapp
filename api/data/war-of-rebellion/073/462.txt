Lookout Valley and, joining the march of the brigade, moved to Gordon's Mills, on a branch of the Chickamauga, where we halted for a day; again moving forward, we halted near Ringgold and sent to the rear our surplus baggage; then we moved to Leet's farm, and from there across Taylor's Ridge, via Gordon's Springs, and, with the Army of the Cumberland, confronted the enemy at Buzzard Roost. Here we skirmished for two days, losing 1 man. Withdrawing, we moved with the brigade, via Snake Creek Gap, upon Resaca; assisted in driving the enemy into his works at this place, and having developed his position and engaged him with slight loss, on the 15th of May we moved with brigade to the extreme left of our army and joined in the attack and assault of that day, which engagement resulted to us in killed and wounded in the loss of 56 men. A full report of the part taken in that engagement by this command has been duly forwarded.* On the following day the regiment joined in the pursuit of the enemy, crossing Connesauga and Coosawattee Rivers, and moving in a southerly direction. On the 18th we again encountered the enemy on a wooded hill, across skirmishers, who fell back toward Cassville. This regiment skirmished in the direction of Kingston, and discovered the enemy in strong force in our immediate front. We then fell back with the brigade and threw up temporary defenses. Subsequently we made a movement to the left and advanced to the seminary at Cassville; drove the enemy's skirmishers into the village, and opened fire on a column of troops passing through the place. Later we supported a section of artillery on Seminary Hill, and kept up a brisk skirmish until relieved by Colonel Coburn, commanding Second Brigade. We rested in this vicinity until the 23rd of May, when we again joined the column on the march; moved down and across the Etowah River, leaving Allatoona Mountains on our left, and crossing Burnt Hickory Ridge, met the enemy near Dallas and participated in the battle fought by the Twentieth Corps on the 25th of May. In this engagement this command lost 72 offices and men in killed and wounded. After this the regiment joined in the successive movements to the left, and on the 15th of June in support of the First Brigade in a charge on the enemy's position near Pine Mountain. On the 19th and 22d, successively, we were joined with the brigade in charging the enemy and driving him within his main works near Kenesaw, in which charges and skirmishes the regiment lost 36 men killed and wounded. On the evening of the 22nd of June we were moved to the right of the corps, on the Powder Springs road, were we remained several days, and until the enemy fell back from Marietta, when we were advanced to the vicinity of the Chattahoochee River. Here we had ten days of much needed rest. On the 17th of July we were thrown across the Chattahoochee and moved toward Buck Head. On the 20th of July we moved early and crossed Peach Tree Creek in the rear of General Newton's position, occupying a place in the second line. My regiment supported and relieved the Twenty-sixth Wisconsin during the engagement of this day, with a loss to the command of 18 officers and men. On the 22nd we were again advanced as the enemy fell back to the defenses of Atlanta. My command occupied temporarily a number of positions during the investment of this place, with a loss of 15 men killed and
