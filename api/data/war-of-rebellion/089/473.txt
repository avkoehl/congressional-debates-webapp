Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The enemy's heavy gun, in what was called the Whitworth battery to the rear of the main line and near the Jerusalem plank road, has disappeared. The enemy has also removed the gun that was visible in fort near the Boisseau house. A working party of about 150 men are engaged in destroying the fort.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac.

I have directed special examination to ascertain what modifications the enemy are making of their line.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,November 1, 1864 - 2 p.m .

Major FISHER:

I have carefully examined the position about the Boisseau house. The enemy are throwing down an angle facing east, and as all their working party is engaged at that point I think they only mean to strengthen their line. The entire ground covered by the work is in a measure commanded by works to the right and left.

Respectfully,

GEO. J. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant, Signal Corps.
