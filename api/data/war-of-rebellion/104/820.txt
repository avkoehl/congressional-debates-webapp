HUNTSVILLE, May 17, 1865.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

I have just returned from an interview with General Roddey, and have signed an agreement by which he will surrender his forces to-morrow at Courtland and the remainder at Moulton and Somervile as soon as they can be collected, on terms granted Lee. He reports to me that there is a band, of marauders preying alike upon citizens of all parties and paroled soldiers, murdering and robbing indiscriminately-three bodies on the road by Colonel Windes and three men in a house soon after, just murdered. A party of Texas Rangers, about seventy- five strong, were at Courtland day before yesterday, robbing Union citizens and threatening paroled soldiers. I request that 100 or 200 cavalry be sent to Decatur at once to hunt out these outlaws. I met a number of influential citizens at the place appointed for an interview with General Roddey, who all evinced a desire to return to their allegiance to the United States. The officers accompanying General Roddey and himself express the same sentiments.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILE, May 17, 1865.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

What shall be done with horses of Confederate soldiers who come in and are paroled? They claim them as private property, stating that their Government never furnished any.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, May 17, 1865.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Huntsville, Ala.:

If I remember right the agreement between Generals Grant and Lee permits only officers to take home their private horses. That being the case, the horses of privates should be taken and turned over to the quartermaster's department.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.
