arrive, they entered with great spirit into the charge, and would have gone forward as far as the first two regiments named, but were ordered to return and form behind a barricade, which they did promptly. There they remained under charge of Colonel Swaine until the final assault, late in the evening, in which they gallantly participated, both officers and men, and where they faithfully remained until ordered by me, under instructions from General Baird, to retire my command fighting, which I did.

I have to report, in the actions of the 19th, the loss of 299 killed, wounded, and missing, 163 on the 19th and 136 on the 20th.

The number and names of officers and men in each regiment will appear in the reports of the respective regimental commanders, herewith filed and marked 1,2,3, and 4. Said reports give in detail the part each regiment took in the actions named, with their versions of the whole affair, which I forward in justice to said commands. From the said reports it will appear that the Fifty-first Ohio [Colonel McClain] lost in killed, wounded, and missing 38 officers and men, to wit, 1 commissioned officer wounded, Lieutenant Wood; 4 missing; 8 enlisted men killed, 34 wounded, and 51 missing. The Ninety-ninth Ohio lost 2 commissioned officers wounded, 3 enlisted men killed, 19 wounded, and 33 missing; making in all, 57 killed wounded, and missing. The Eighth Kentucky lost 2 commissioned officers wounded, 1 missing; 4 enlisted men killed, 45 wounded, and 27 missing; making in all, 79. The Thirty-fifth Indiana lost 2 commissioned officers wounded, 2 missing; 5 enlisted men killed, 21 wounded, and 35 missing; making in all, 65.

The following is the number of officers and men carried into action on the 19th:

I regret to report the loss of Colonel R. W. McClain and Lieutenant Colonel James D. Mayhew. They were gallant, efficient, and very valuable officers. I fear they are killed. Colonel Mayhew was missing in the battle of the 19th, in the charge made by the brigade. Colonel McClain was lost late in the evening of the 20th, after the order to retire fighting. He could not be excelled for genuine coolness and bravery. He obeyed all orders with great promptness.
