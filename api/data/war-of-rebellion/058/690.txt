GENERAL: I herewith send you a copy of the last dispatch from the front:

BRANDON, MISS.,

February 7, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding:

GENERAL: The enemy have crossed the river and are driving my men in on both the upper and lower Jackson roads. They are fighting me altogether with small-arms.

I am, general, very respectfully,

C. C. WILBOURN,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

It will be necessary to have some cavalry on the road to Jackson. I am informed that Wilbourn has only 40 men and Herren only 60 men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Cullum's, Jackson and Canton Road, February 7, 1864.

Major General W. W. LORING,

Morton:

GENERAL: I wrote you last night and this morning. Send you a copy of my last. Have established a line of couriers from Smith's Ferry to Morton. The enemy's pickets are 5 miles from Jackson. I fear there was a large fire in Jackson last night from the appearance of the sky. I scarcely think the camp-fires of the enemy would have made such a glare. I am a little embarrassed about moving from this position till the enemy makes some move, as he has ample supplies to go to Meridian. I send you a good regiment this morning.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS LORING'S DIVISION,Morton, February 7, 1864.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I cannot hear anything of the regiment of cavalry you spoke of, but understand they are scattered on conscript duty. My front between here and Jackson is entirely exposed, with the exception of a squadron of cavalry, and may be subject at any time to small raids of the enemy. Troops are concentrating here from Meridian.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General.

Heard from Brandon late yesterday; no enemy there.
