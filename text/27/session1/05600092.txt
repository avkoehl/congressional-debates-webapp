pose, would depend opon th« valuation, if valued
at fifty cems, the rates oí duty would be the same,
if more than fifty rents, then the ad valorem «j s-
tem would increase the rait, and if less than fifty
cents, it might work a reduction Tms recommen-
dation may not be carried out. I do not know
that ih  Committee of Ways and Means approve
it. It is hoped they do not Ot course 1 kiow
nothing of their jn'emion*, and will not anticipate
the result of their deliberations, but every one must
perceive, if the bill under debate n to become a
law, the deficiency in ¡be Treasury must be m de
up from some q arter, or the country must incur
the curse of a national debt O ie thing is well
known, and that is, that a proposition is now on
your table to create a permanent loan for twelve
millions of dillars and unless that amount Mull
be increased no other re-ort is left but to a lopt trie

The bill it=ef, thctefore, as^um s teat there is
no sucn relation as oebtor and creditor between
the Fedeial Government and any one or more of
H. ot Reps.
the States—gry such justification for the measure
is nega'ived by (he provision in bfhalf of States
that never set up any claim to'he lands, aod^had
loexiteec at t'e time of their cession* In
another respect, ih  relation of debtor and creditor
is very clearly denied on the face of the bill It
proposes lo appropriate money derived from farads
only Wtjy confine its application to money de-
rived fr mland, it th s Government is indebted to
the Stales m any legal or (¡quttab'e sense? No one
•tail deny the right to appropriate money, whether
received from lands or customs, in discharge of
debts due to States or nidividuals Congress
may pro\ ide, by law, for the pajment of tbe pub-
lic debt, by revenue from land , custom', excise,
dirsct taxation, or from the sale of other property
bebngmg to the Ui ited States.
There is still one more argument in negation of
ary pre ence of indeo edness, that maybe dtawn
from the foutth section of the bill, to vh ch parti-
cular attention is asieed    It provides that

Whit can demonstrate more clearly thit the ap
propria tion 1 a barefaced gra uity' If the money
belong t > the S ates, why suspend the operations
of the act in any event? What is *ne exea e put

man e t ln no sutu j «-tif «a 1 n as mdebtuiness
ca 1 ba set up with an> success, m the argument, to
support this meisurc Tne money power is a'-
ways an exoress power as "to raise and support
armies, but no appvopnation of money to that
use shall be for a longer term than two years"—"to
provide and mamta n a navy," and "to make all
law  wmch shall be necessary and proper for cai-
rymg inn execution the forego ng powers and all
other po" ers vested by this Constitu ion in the Go-
vernment of the Ueued States or in any depart-
m nt 0 ofh er thereof " Wha are those power 1
fhey are all enumerated in the Co"stitution or
contuied in the jrerer I p^ra e, "to m?ire nil
'us 1 tcts aij an 1 piipT for c rr^ieg 11 to
tsecutun tnose that are specifically grant-
ed and enumerated" Where is the power to
sp'-n pruts money as a g-atuity to the S ates? It
is not enumer ted, nor is it neo'sary or. proper,
n the sense m which Mr Jefferson b?i explained
those w irds, to enable Coigress to carry out any
ere of th granted powers in the C©nstitutior>, and
if that be true, then the power does not exist, be-
csuse it is expressly p ov ded that tbe powers not
de egated to tbe United Sutts by t^e Con  liutioli,
ntr j 01 b ted by it to the States, are re<ervd to
th°<St tes íespectively, or to the people. I con-
