Numbers 39. Report of Major John McE. Hyde, Thirty-ninth New York Infantry, of operations March 25.
HDQRS. THIRTY-NINTH NEW YORK VET. VOLUNTEERS,March 26, 1865

SIR: In obedience to orders from brigade headquarters of this date, I have the honor to submit the following report:

At 11.30 a.m. yesterday we were ordered to the front to support the attacking party. We remained in reserve all day. During the afternoon we supported a battery while it dislodged a force of the enemy from a large house, which was done effectually. Although we were not actually engaged with the enemy, yet the men acted brave and cool; and had our assistance been required, I am confident the men would have conducted themselves with credit.
