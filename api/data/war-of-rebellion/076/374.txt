HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 5, 1864--12.40 p. m. (Received 12.50 p. m.)

General STANLEY:

Schofield is heavily engaged with the enemy. Watch them closely in your front and take advantage of any attempt they may make to withdraw from your front. Threaten them all along your line. Tell Garrard to keep a good lookout on his front and take advantage immediately of any favorable opportunity to move against the enemy.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864--4.45 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

I attacked the rebels with a heavy skirmish line along my whole front; drove them from their rifle-pits in front of Grose's position from Wood's front. We received a heavy fire from their main works, musketry and artillery. From Grose's we received a heavy fire from their main works and a heavy out-work 100 yards in front of the main work. I see no chance to carry their main work without severe loss. I have not heard from Newton yet. I am now moving regiments to the front and will make a reconnaissance, feeling for their right. No movements of the enemy except manning the works have been observed. They have been discovered at work all day.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,August 5, 1864.

Generals NEWTON and WOOD:

Schofield is heavily engaged with the enemy. Re-enforce your skirmish line; open fire and advance your skirmishers where you can threaten the enemy, and if he leaves his works to re-enforce his left take advantage to push into his works. Make his skirmish line hot for him; open deliberately with solid shot on his batteries.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
