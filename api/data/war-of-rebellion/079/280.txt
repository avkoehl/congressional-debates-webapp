General WAGNER:

General Thomas orders that the force at Ringgold be drawn into Chattanooga, but should probably be kept out until the trains and troops from this place pass the junction. The last will probably start from here about noon.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have no news from the south. The wires are down between Graysville and Ringgold. A scouting party, numbering thirty-two men, charged into La Fayette on the evening of the 12th, and were driven out by about 200 rebels. General Morgan's DIVISION has arrived here.

Major-General THOMAS:

Scouts sent from here yesterday report at 3 this p. m. [October 13] from near Rock Spring Church that only a few rebel cavalry have yet made their appearance in that vicinity. Cavalry sent out to-day in the same direction, with orders to report everything of interest, have not yet reported. Colonel Hays, at Ringgold, says, in answer to a dispatch to know if rebel infantry had made its appearance at Dalton, that if reports are to be relied upon the rebels have infantry near there. Reports are very contradictory in regard to rebels.

Respectfully,

S. B. MOE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
