Major General A. H. TERRY,

Commanding Detachments Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have ordered General Ames to cross the river at Fort Anderson and report to you this evening. In the morning I want you to move forward against the enemy, east of the river, while General Cox will move up the west bank. If you find the enemy in a fortified position this side of Wilmington, try to turn his left and force him back upon Wilmington, or you may endeavor to cut him off from that place if your force appears sufficient. If the enemy fall back to the defenses of Wilmington invest the place as far as practicable. In any other event act as may seem for the best. Communicate with me frequently, by signal or otherwise. I will move up the river in the Spaulding, so as to keep in communication with the troops on both side.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

FEDERAL POINT, N. C., February 19, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

My advance is about eight miles from Wilmington, close to the enemy's outposts. Unless I receive contrary orders from you I shall camp for the night at about nine miles from the city and await re-enforcements. Can they reach me before daylight?

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
