25th Cong*•••2nd Sess.                                     Independent Treasury—Mr. Bayard                                                                   Senate.
on the high road to that full development—that the pathway to
it was then direct befoie us—that we were making rapid ad
vanees in that pathwa /, and that our final and complete success
was certain. The rivers do not find their way with more cer
tamty nor more rapidly to the ocean, than that course of po
licy was carrying the country on to that final and complete
s uccess, and when he reflecte, too, that we have only to re
turn to the same course of policy still to reach that glorious des
tmation
But there is a lion in the path A phantom is conjured up to
fill the people with imaginary terrors, and to frighten them from
a return to that path They are told that the money power
wielded by the banks is dangerous to the liberties of the country,
as if that money power could have any possible interest m ar
raying itselfagamst those liberties Why the prosperity of the
country is the very element in which the banks live and
breathe and move and have then being, of which prosperity
they are at once both the effect and the cause Destroy that
prosperity, and you destroy them They to an ay themselves
against those liberties, when those liberties are intimately
blended with that prosperity, and essential to it' Destroy those
hbeities, and you destioy that \ lospenty But if the hanks
were foolish enough and wicked enough to attempt this now,
could they act in combinador to this tilth Banks have nothing
of the esprit du corps, nor is it in the nature of things that they
should have They are made up of individuals scattered far
and wide, mostly unknown to each other and who have no meet
mgs together, for the annual meetings  for the choice of directors
are nevei atiende 1 but by a few Besides the members are
made upof all partita, and are changing constantly, the mem
hers to day not being the members to morrow A bank ]<* a
mere money makm? concern, and looks only to that business
It is true that when their ^xwtence is. attacked thev act upon
the common pimciple of human nature, m self defence, and
stand upon their chaitered lights I  no case (and heie I defy
contradiction) has any bank corporation in this country ever
been known to move with a c jncerted action to any political ob
ject whatever I speak not of the m Jividual membeia, i speak
of the corporate body moving as a corpoiate "body The truth
is, they have less of (he esprit du coi ps than any other coi pora
tions whatever Even re! gions corporations ha\ e far more of
that spin t
The money power wielded by the banks dangerous to the
liberties of the country ' I marvel that the State Legislatures
have nevei had the sagacity to perceive this dangei They
have now been m the practice of creatine: the c corporations,
the old States for forty > ears and the new States evei since they
have been States, and are "till m the practice This proves as
it seems to me, eithei that the dangei >a &o bmall as to be mvi
sible to them or that the> are indifferent to those ibeities If
the danger is tu o small to be visible, it seems tome it is oo n
small tobe talked about, and if the=e >ta e Legislatures are '
really indifferent to those liberties, why, thedanger comes fioin
them, and the war should be made against them Then we
should fight the danger at the fountain head, and in its head
quai ters
I know that there is a little band of Loco Focos in each of
the seveial States, (who, by the by I would not speak disre
epectfully of them now, ¡since the President has seen fit to put
himself at their head, and to make himself their chief,) a little
band, I say who aiefnghtened or affect to be, at this dangei,
who are raising a terrible outcry asainst banks on this account,
and who are mce&sdiitlv warning their Leeialatuies of ilia
danger -But stiange to teb and lamentaba a* stian^e the&e
Legislatures "eem to pa> a^ little heed to then warning voice 
as they would to the barking oí so many, I will rot say what
And there is icason tot ai that th^ outcn heie ibout this dan
gei pven in the Senate ^hambei oí the United State  wi1! be as
little heeded bv them id that they will still "o on creatine
the e corporations J thru 1 have seen it seated in the papers
that Mississippi, this Loco Foco ciy of danger to the contrary
notwithstanding, is now engaged in the hoind act of c eating a
bank with a capital of someten mill ons
Theie is, too another hen rn the path, anothoi phantom The
banks it is said, are dangerous to the stability of property by
then poweratwill to elevate or depress its standard of valve,
to elevate by their expansions, and to depress by their contrac
tions It they had this power (for which there is not a tha low
of a pietex ) what posible inteiest can they have m causing
these elevations and depie« iorsí They deal only in money,
not at all m pro} eity The m'eiest on their discounts i  all
thevcanmale that inteiest is fixe' by 1 tw that interest thev
cannot enlarge without forfeiting then chxrter- So if they
had this power, they could gam nothing by i s exeiciae
Besides, these expansions depend not upon the wiP of the
bank, but upon the community wheiethey exist They can
make no dis ounts lfno discounts are demanded, nor beyond
the demand, and that demand will be governed by the exigen
cíes of business at thp time As for contractions they have this
power, and they must have it for their own safety No bank
would be sale foi a day wit íout this powei Bu there is no
danger of the abuse of that power, foreveiy contraction is so far
adnectlos-nothebank itself
Besides, farther, this imaginary power supposes a condition
which it is impossible should ever exist It supposes that the
eight hundred banks of the country (if there be sn many) will all
by concert expand on the same day, and all by concert contract
on the same day and lurthei, as to expansions that all the bust
uess men of the countiy, m concert with the bank*, will simul
taneou&ly make a demand for discounts on that day Of all the
pi eposteious ideas that ever entered into the head of a man the
idea ofsuch a concert and combination appears to methemo--t
preposterous
As to the i lea that a National Bank would be still more dan
gerous in both these respect*, that is, if posible a still more
pieposterous idea, for it supposes that a bank which we have
under out absolute contio1 and oui constant inspection would
be more dangeious than the eight hundred banks of the States,
with ten times the capital, over which we have no control, irto
who^e affairs we have no nshf of inspection
\s to expansions and contractions with repaid tn every bank,
these do and must take plate They ate the nece^an- conse
queiice of their connection with the buaines- of the countiy and
¡he ebbs and flow sin that bo mess but these aie compensated,
and a thousand times compútate 1, by the benefit- of that busi
nesstothe country
These two phantoms, namely, the danger ofbankf to theh
beiues of the country, and thedanger of bank* to theatabiiuy
of property, I hope ha\e hal then day, and will soo i vanish
The dawn aeems to be bieakmgupon the country, when these
phantoms, like all unreal beings, who mock the benighted
vision of men, will disappear For m every quarter we hear
an outcry against this barbarous and chimerical attempt to
carry the country back to a metallic cuirency, as the only me
dium of exchange Every where we see the people taking
their stand on the side of that capital which the banks with then
ctedjts alone can give to the business of the country Every
where their complaints are reproaching the Government for
the want of that national currency, by which alone the ex
changes on which the whole business of the country depends,
can be put on a convenient and prosperous footing
These aie the harbingers of that dawn to which 1 haveal
luded But though we have the dawn, we have y et to wait for the
day, that is, we have yet to wait the lime when the people can
interpose and act for their own relief Yes, the people are yet
to suffer, and to suffer yet more severely That great pause in
the whole business of the country, which has now endured so
many months, is yet to endure for months to come, and that
general diatresi, which is the consequence of that pause, and
which has deepened from month to month is yet to deepen and
to deepen still further upon the people Fur I take it be a «et
tied thing that this Administration is not to concede to the peo
pie any of those measures, which they consider and demand
as measures of renef, and that the hand which has afflicted is
not tobe the han 1 which i& to relieve the countiy

Piesident did in hisSept^mber Message, to deny its truth, and
we are called upon to show that clause of the Constitution
which gives the power and imposes the duty If must be re
collected that the Constitution is a collection of general prmci
pies, expiessed m general phrases, and that their import is to
be gatheied from the context and the subject matter in relation
to which they are used Bearing this m mind, there is no diffi
culty m showing, from the circumstances under which the
Constitution wag adopted, from the positive provisions which
it contains, from the subject matter of those provisions, and
from the authority of its commentators, that such power is
given and such duty imposed One of the highest wants of the
social state is a common medium of exchange, some species
of property which, having universal value, is exchangeable for
all othei commodities, and the possession of which will enable
every md vidual to command &uch of the nece«sanes oí Jife as
his condition requires That species of property is money In
