SURVEYING DISTRICT IN ARIZONA.
The bill (H. R. No. 686) to make the Terri-
tory of Arizona a separate surveying district,
and to establish the office of surveyor general
therein, was read twice by its title.
Mr. POMEROY. I think that bill ought to
be put on its passage at once. It simply cre-
ates the office of surveyor general in Arizona.
I presume there will -be no objection to it.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. Itproposes to create the Terri-
tory of Arizona into a separate surveying dis-
trict, and authorizes the President, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, to ap-
point a surveyor general of the Territory, whose
annual salary shall be $3,000, andwhose power,
authority, and duties are to be the same as
those provided by law for the surveyor gen-
eral of Oregon ; and he is to have proper allow-
ances for clerk hire, office rent, and fuel, and
is to locate his office from time to time at such
place as may be directed by the President of
the United States.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. CAMERON presented a memorial of
citizens of Easton, Pennsylvania, remonstrat-
ing against the continuance of the income tax ;
which was ordered to lie on the table.

Richard M. Harvey, praying the refunding of
certain moneys, the proceeds of a sale of to-
bacco under decree of a court at Richmond,
Virginia, and erroneously covered into the
Treasury ; which was referred to the Commit-
tee oil Claims.
Mr. CASSERLY. I present a memorial of
importers and dealers in wines and liquors of
San Francisco, complaining of certain features
in the internal revenue acts, and asking that a
portion of the taxes be repealed. In part this
memorial has already been forestalled by action
of the Senate. I also present a similar memo-
rial from the same class of persons in Stockton,
California. As the Senate have acted on the
subject, I move that they lie on the table.
The motion was agreed to.

FORFEITURE OF RAILROAD GRANT.
Mr. POMEROY. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 2359) to declare forfeited
to the United States certain lands granted to
the State of Louisiana to aid in the construc-
tion of a railroad therein, to report it with an
amendment; and I ask that it be put on its
passage now. These lands have been hereto-
fore withdrawn, and this bill restores them to
the public land system. I hope it will be acted
upon at once.
By unanimous consent, t.he Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It declares all the lands which
were granted by Congress, in the year 1856
to the State of Louisiana, to aid in the con-
struction of the New Orleans, Opelousas, and
Great Western railroad, and which have not
been lawfully disposed of by the State under
the grant, which has expired by limitation,
or by act of Congress since the original
grant, forfeited to the United States, and that
they shall henceforward be subject to home-
stead entry and settlement, under the act, of
Congress approved June 21, 1866, for the dis-
posal of the public lands for homestead actual
settlement in the States named in that act,
precisely as are other public lands therein.
The Committee on Public Lands reported
the bill with an amendment, to strike out the
following words:
And shall henceforward be subject to homestead
entry and settlement, uudev the act of Congress
approved Juno 21,1866, for the disposal of the pub-
lic lands for homestead actual settlement in tho
States named in said act, precisely as are other pub-
lic lands therein.
And to insert in lieu thereof:
And these lands shall be hereafter disposed of as
other public lands of the United States.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed. The amendment was concurred in and
ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be
read a third time. The bill was read the third
time, and passed.
