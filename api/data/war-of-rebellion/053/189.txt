Brigadier-General WILLIAMS:

Instructions to General Slocum by telegraph post his command between Murfreesborough and Tantalon. Knipe's brigade is here. Ruger's between Stone's River and Fosterville. I presume General Slocum will to-night give full instructions to troops; will have to march to their positions to have the railroad for supplies.
