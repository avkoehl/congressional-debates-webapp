Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The right of my skirmish line has advanced in front of Fort Howard and driven the enemy back to their works, where they seem to be in considerable force. This portion of my line is as far advanced as it can be.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,October 8, 1864.

Major-General PARKE:

GENERAL: The object of the reconnaissance has been accomplished on the right, and I have given orders for the establishment of the picket-line on the right only. Has your left advanced? General Ayres has orders to take the W. Davis house in his front. Please let me know when your line halts and you have accomplished your object, as we must fall back carefully and together.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
