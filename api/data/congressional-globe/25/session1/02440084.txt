strate that many o' t! es banks, 'roil time to t me,
owed their very existence to the forbearance of tne
Secretary of the Treasury, and that often a Trea-
sury draft or tran ler warrant wou'dhaxe reduced
them to a state oí ban' ruptcy True it is, (hat all
of the deposite banl s could n< t thus have bem de-
stroyed by the Secretan, yet tne profits of a'l
would be grea ly'nflaen'-ed by the amount < f re-
venue he deposited with, oi witndiew fiom
them What, then, was this pow..r? It was ?
pywerovereigatj-nine of ihe stron est conredeiated
hanks in the Unii n, with this tnoi-m his amount of
loans and capital, and «ith stockhoicHs, debtors
and cnstomeis, at least one hundied thou and in
numb i, all affected by the movements of the Se-
cretary of the Treasury ¡n the d stnbstion or vvnh-
diawal of the deposites In Maj last, the Secretary
of the Tieasury had necessanly distributed among
these institutions more than thirty mi lions of pub-
lic deposites WhaUí tremendous extent o< power
and patronage' Why, sir, it was almost the lever
of Archimedes, and if this system had gone on nro-
gressmgand augrrentmg, soon, very soon, the banks
by their power must have controlled the Government,
or the Government controlled the banks And
now when the Pi esident pi oposes to surrender all this
money, and power, and patronage, to dissolve this
dangerous connection between the banks ini\ the
©overnment, shall he oe opposed in this measure
by those who so lately denounced the whole deposite
bank system as the very climax of political coirup-
tion'! And what do we see now1! Why, this careei
of illimitable discounts by banks on Government
deposites is ciosed for thepiesent, ml the still more
dangerous attitude is exh bited, in which it is but
too probable tint very man) of the bank., may
soon be sued by the Gov ernment to recover the pub
lie moneys, or lather the States that ow n m whok or
inpart so many of these banks, and the debtors that
owe them, for, as the banks can o'ly collect their
moneys by suits against their debtors, to sue the
banks at present, is to sue the people It was in
view of this state of facts that I succeeded a few
days smce m prolonging the time given to the
deposite banks to make payment to the Govern-
ment, from two, five, and eight, to foui, six, and
nine «ion h , bung the longest extension I coild
ol tvm for then, and upon payment t the first
nstalment, the two last ought to be, an 1 I hope
will be, stdl fmther prolonged at the next session
Bui I could not but ieel bumiliatedb} the reflection
that so many of my most worth) con titu nts—
including two of our largest State institutions, and
the State itse'f the principal pi opnetor of one of
them—should be placed m a posit on m which a
suit against any of them could in any event be
rosorted ti—a posit <n arising ojt o> this mo^t
unholy conm ction between the b^'nts an J the Trea-
suiy—a connectii n oí unmixed evils, dt is reus to
the banks, the States, ths people, and t''e Govern-
ment
Well, th-n, may the Senator from Scuih Caro-
lina, (Mr Calhoui,) who has on this il< or so re-
peatedly oppo ed the augmentation oí Executive
power—well may he support the b It now un ler
consideration, because it not on!) a ds nothing to
Executive patronage, but takes fr< ra it that alaim-

co Wed by the Government from the people, was
not loaned out to the people who paid it, but depo
s tc 1 with banks to be loaned out by them to bank
vo'orie^, and to increase the dividends of a lew
corporated stockholde s The people were taxed
for revenue, to be conterted into bank capital, sti-
mulatng tneir over-issues, and rendeimg their con-
di ion more fluctuating and piecanous TI e fluc-
tuation oí banking business is bad enough under
any circumstances Wly, then should we aug-
ment their natuial tendency to over-issue by Go-
veinment deposite-,'! Will not the banks issue
enough of paper without this artificial stimulus?
Why, then, should the Government inflate their
i«s ic, and drive them on more rapidly to explo-
sion? Why not let them bank upon their own ca-
pital and then own credit, v. ithout depending upon
the Government for both—for capital in Govern-
ment deposites, and for credit in Government en-
dorsement for all their notes, as receivable in re-
venue parents'! Is !t not seen that the most in-
solvent bank m the Union might thus be pufied by
tie Govern  ent nto "'teat an 1 extensive tempora-
r) map ltanee, id hen, when the Government pa-
tioaage was withdiawn, their depreciated papei
fall dead and woi hless m the lunds of an un us-
pectmg community1
The Pi esident s Message is against <lie extension
of Executive patronage Its cardinal doctrine is
this " A limitation of the expenses of the Govern-
ment to its «dual wank, and of the revenue to those
expenses " This, then, is the Piesident's doctrme,
openly avowed in his Message—reduce your
expenses, leduce your revenues This was the bag
under which I have fought ever since entering this
eh mber it is lb" (lag under wh ch I opno«cd your
extravag nt bi s f< r local and sectioral impreve
tnents, it is the principle I  spcsed at the first
session of my service, contained m my resolution
to reduce the revenue from the tanfl and public
lands to the wants of the Government It is tne
great principle contained in the land bill proposed
by me, reducing to settlers the price of the public
lands, and confining the sales to them, it is the
great principle upon which I relied for the reduc-
tion of the tariff, and especially the abohshirg of
the duty upon salt, that most odious duty upon light
and heat, m foi rung salt from solar evaporation, and
lastly, it is thegreatpnncipleuponwhich,atthe Irst
as well as the last session, I opposed, in every form,
the suiplus dstribiion policy, that mother of ta-
riffs, banks, and ol the very catastrophe which nov
tverwheims us Reduction ot the expenses and of
the levenue economy in all public expenditures,
and no " interference wi h the pursuits oí the citi-

lastly, to gne uu versalify to tl e principle, the sur-
plUq—the annual «urp'os for distribution, from
sales by to\ aships an I c rallies at an entry, to spe-
culators in the public lands—asjstem calculated to
debauch and corrupt the States, to break down e\e-
ry fee'ng of S ate independence, to feed them an-
nually from the public Treasury, mere stipendia-
ries upon our bounty, supporting even their State
Governments and State olncers from the íevenues
of this Go ¿ernni'mt And at the head oí this mighty
system, this consol dalion of all powers m this Go-
vernment, won d stand the executive of those pow-
ers—the President oí the Ui ited States, a monarch
in etc?!/ thing but m name And, sir, this league of
State banks, confederated by the Government, ancl
fed by the tariff, increasing its deposites and profits,
would be the next most po'ent ally of these systems
It would station some hundied bank fortresses
throughout the States, armed and equipped by Go-
vernment deposites, and extending Executive power
and influence 4.11 this President Van Buren would
aioid No, sn, no, it is not the principle or
policy of this administration—Give us patronage
and we will make ourselves popular
But u has been said that this bill establishes, in
fact, a Treasury tank And wh)? Because, al-
though these depos tones can neither use or loan
the public moneys, where disbuisem°nts are to be
made at distant pom s, to a oid the expense and
p it o aBt pus ag fn in i i íw urmy of officers, con-
stantly engaged in iraispoitng the specie, drafts
in payment of its dues may be diawn by the Go-
vernment on uVse distant depositories—drafts drawn
on actual deposites of gold and silver, and this is
called a Treasury bank, and that too by the advo-
cates of the deposite bank system, by which Trea-
suty diafli, checks, and wan ants upon and by the
banks mav be drawn upon and by the deposite
banks m. the transactions of the Government It
is true these drafts will constitute the best exchange
in the woiid, and thus far operate incidentally for
the great convenience and benefit of the people,
but this is no objection to the system, for the Go-
vernment neithei loans nor discounts, but simply
piysthe public creditor m gold and silver, or an
oreler upon a depository, on which he recen es the
specie
But it is said this bill, separating the Government
from the bank , will divorce the Government from
the peop e Are the banks the people? No, sir,
this bill will e'evate the people, and the Govern-
ment of the pee pie and of the States, above the
banks, and pie ent them from arresting the Go-
vernment, as they now oo, by v ilhhold ng the pub-
ic rev enue It will have a still gieatei tendency
to elevate the people above the banks, by diminish-
ing, by its incidental operation, the amount of bank
r> per, and incieasmg the circulation of gold and
silver—ioi the payment of it into the Tieasury will
he as consi-ntly flowing out, enriching and fertili/-
n g the Villi le country
Biu the Senator from Virginia (Mi Rives) says
this bi I will furnish one cuirency for the Govern-
ment, and another for the people Is it contended
mat the Government shcu d take and pay out r>e
broken bank notes and local shm-plas ers, because
tne people take tl em? Ke the Senator fiom Vir-
ginia doe* rot propose tl is butonly that we should
