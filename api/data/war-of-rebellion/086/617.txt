Live Oak, and Eclipse at daylight to-morrow morning, 20th instant, leaving one commissioned officer and twenty men for each boat. Also one commissioned officer and twenty men for guard on steamer Emma Numbers 2, to report on board the boat at 10 a. m. to-morrow. They are going down White River and the Arkansas and will take rations for ten days.

By order of Brigadier-General Dennis:

RICHARD A. KENT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, November 19, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

I understand there is a perfect crowd of steamers at your post loaded with forage. I think that those whose cargo can be put under cover there should be unloaded and the rest sent up the Arkansas, which is up and likely to be so for some time. We must send forage to Fort Smith, and the railroad has not capacity to do the business. There are no rebel troops on the Arkansas. Put guards on the boats that are to go that way, and I will have the river patrolled from Pine Bluff. The captain of the Zephyr wishes to unload and return to Memphis for a load to go to Fort Smith. Please give me your views.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., November 19, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major General F. STEELE, Little Rock:

The Zephyr, Tempest, Eclipse, and Live Oak, four boats, are still loaded with forage and quartermaster's stores. I recommend they be sent up the Arkansas.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.

LITTLE ROCK, November 19, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Commanding, Devall's bluff:

I am informed that the Tempest is only partly loaded, and that the Eclipse is in a sinking condition. Can you not designate other boats in their place?

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., November 19, 1864-3.15 p. m.

Major General F. STEELE, Little Rock:

Your dispatch is received. Captain Gaubert say the Eclipse is not in a sinking condition, but is all right. The Tempest has 1,000 bales of hay board. The Emma, Captain Gaubert says, has not a full load, but she can go.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.
