small parties of guerrillas on the hills near Campbellsville, by whom he lost one man killed. The intelligence I have from scouts and citizen refugees is that Hood's army is at Florence (mostly this side of the river), which his advance fifteen miles out, apparently making no preparations for a forward movement. Forrest is scouting the country up to this point and Lawrenceburg, seeking leather, clothing, &amp;c. I can hear nothing of General Hatch. I shall send out heavy scouting parties to-morrow in the direction of Florence and make every effort in my power to communicate with him. I send you a sketch* of the roads radiating from this place, by which you will see that we are isolated, our right and rear being entirely exposed. The nearest and only communication with Lawrenceburg is eighteen miles to our rear upon the Mount Pleasant road, and it is fourteen miles from that point to said town, making by the nearest route thirty-two miles from Waynesborough to Lawrenceburg, there being no direct road east from this point, as indicated by the maps. I shall place a force of fifty men at Lawrenceburg. Forage is very scarce, there being none on the Waynesborough and Mount Pleasant or the Lawrenceburg and Mount Pleasant roads, and but very little here. I have four days' rations on hand for the command, and my only communication with my base of supplies is either Pulaski, via Lawrenceburg, fifty-two miles, or Columbia, via Mount Pleasant, fifty-six miles. I learn from reliable citizens that there is a rebel force at Clifton, fifteen miles west, under Colonel baffle; and another at Linden, twenty-eight miles north. The inhabitants in and about the latter place and Ashland are reported as strong rebels. The scouts driven out of Waynesborough upon my taking possession divided, and, pressing guides, took the direction of Clifton and Linden, which would indicate the truth of the reports referred to. The roads are fast becoming impassable.

Very truly,

HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
