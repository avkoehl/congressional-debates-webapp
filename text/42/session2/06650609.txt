Question. That is the seat of government,
where the election was held?
Ansicer. Yes, sir.
Question. When was that conversation?
Answer. I had several conversations with
him concerning the matter, and they were held
prior to the joint convention—a part of them
prior to any votes being cast, I believe, at all.
Question. Now begin and state those con-
versations, beginning with the first and going
straight, on in your own language, distinguish-
ing one conversation from another. What was
the first conversation ? Where was it?
Answer. Perhaps, to make it clearer and
show on what side I was, I will state that I was
myself personally a supporter of A. L. Lee,
doing what I could to secure his election. I
went first to Senator Pomeroy to see whether
I could make any arrangements with him by
which I could secure the election of Mr. Lee.
What passed I don't remember; I only know
that my attempts were futile, and before the
election was held it was a self evident proposi-
tion that Senator Pomeroy would be elected.
That was conceded by all before we went into
joint convention. In the course of a conver-
sation with him on one occasion. what exactly
passed I don't remember; I did not impress
my mind with it at all; having been iu other
things since I have not thought about it, only
one remark I think of about that, and that was
this: ke said, " I have expended a fortune to
defeat Thomas Carney,"
Question. '' I have expended a fortune ?''
Answer. Yes, sir. Now, whether that was
just before, or just exactly what time it was,
I don't remember.
Question. Just before what?
Answer. I think that was the night preced-
ing the joint convention, but I am not positive.
Question. At what place in Topeka was that?
Answer. At the hotel where he had his
rooms.
Question. Was it in his room ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Were any other persons than you
and he present?
Answer. Not in that room. I don'tremem-
ber whether any one was in the adjoining one
or not. Perry Fuller may have been in the
adjoining room, but I ana not sure that be wag.
Question. Did he show you anything at that
time as evidence that he had expended a for-
tune?
Answer. He did not.
Question. Did he have a check-book there?
Answer. There was a book lying on the
table, perhaps as far off as that stand—six or
eight feet.
Question. What about it?
Answer. I judged from its general appear-
ance that it was a check-book. I could not
say that it was.
Question. Did he make any observations
about it?
Answer. No; he simply, as he spoke, pointed
at that.
Question. Pointed at that check-book ?
Answer. Yes, sir.'
Question. Did you see Perry Fuller there?
Answer. I did.
Question. At what hotel did Mr. Pomeroy
have his quarters; what was the name of the
hotel?
Answer. I believe it was the Capitol House.
Question. At what hotel did Perry Fuller
have his headquarters?
Answer. 1 don't know, but suppose he was
in the same building.
Question. For whom was Perry Fuller at
work ? For anybody.
Answer. E. G. Boss.
Question. Was he favorable or unfavorable
to the election of Mr. Pomekoy?
Answer. I never heard him say whether he
was or not.
Question. Do you know of any consultations
between him and Pomekoy?
Answer. I only saw him in Mr. Pomeroy's
room on several occasions when I was in there.
Further than that I do not know about it.
Question. You do not know what was the
connection between them?
Answer. Well, neither of them ever told me
that there was any connection between them.
Question. State generally what Perry Fuller
was doing there.
Answer. He was doing all he could to elect
E. G. Ross.
Question. You say it was admitted on all
hands that Pomeroy would be elected?
Answer. Yes, sir ; it was.
Question. How long did that contest con-
tinue before the election; how long before the
election did the parties and their friends come
on the ground ?
Answer. They came on the ground as soon
as the Legislature met, which was, I think,
some two weeks preceding.
Question. Was Perry Puller there from the
first?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. From the first was there any doubt
as to Pomeroy's election?
Answer. I thought there was in the outset.
Question. You thought there was?
Answer. He was the leading candidate from
the outset.
Question. "Who was thought most likely to
beat him if he were beaten at all ?
Answer. There were so many contingencies
upon which that would be based, it would be
almost impossible to auswer. The two lead-
ing candidates against him were Carney and
Lee.

expending any money in that contest?
Answer. I do not.
