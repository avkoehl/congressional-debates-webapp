Major-General PARKE:

All the troops here can be furnished with transportation tomorrow. What troops shall be sent and will they go to Lexington or Nicholasville?

GEO. P. WEBSTER,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

SOMERSET, August 22, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Started from Buck Creek this morning at 4.30. Troops arrived well, but trains got along badly. Division trains have very bad teams and wagons. General ammunition and supply train, turned over by Captain Morris, can go anywhere; the others will break down and be hard to get along. Colonel Wolford says road at and beyond Smith's Ford is very rough. General White started all right.
