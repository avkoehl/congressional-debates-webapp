FORT MONROE, April 23, 1863.

Major-General KEYES,

Commanding, Yorktown:

I have been every day since you were here to the Nansemond or to Suffolk. We cannot get more troops for you at present. I do not feel easy about our force at Fort Magruder. It would not be difficult to cut it off. If we remain there we must hold Williamsburg with our pickets. Please send the correspondence with Dr. Wager, late in charge of the asylum. I may write General Wise. If we get rid of the enemy at Suffolk I shall strengthen you for active work.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
