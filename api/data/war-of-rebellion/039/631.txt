T. A. MEYSENBERG,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 25, 1863.

ADDENDA.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ELEVENTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 9. May 10, 1863.

As your commanding general, I cannot fail to notice a feeling of depression on the part of a portion of this corps. Some obloquy has been cast upon us on account of the affair of Saturday, May 2. I believe that such a disaster might have happened to any other corps of this army, and do not distrust my command. Every officer who failed to do his duty by not keeping his men together, and not rallying them when broken, is conscious of it, and must profit by the past.

I confidently believe that every honorable officer and every brave man earnestly desires an opportunity to advance against the enemy, and demonstrate to the army and to the country that we are not wanting in principle or patriotism. Your energy, sustained and directed under the Divine blessing, shall yet place the Eleventh Corps ahead of them all.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.
