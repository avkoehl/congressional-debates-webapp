Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have obtained an order for 3,000 accouterments from Louisville and have bought 1,000. Colonel Symington advises my agent at Pittsburg to contract for the balance. Can be Government furnish them or shall I contract?

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 23, 1862.

His Excellency O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana:

The United States have bought and are buying the accouterments that can be produced in the country; but a few of the makers, and among the rest those about Pittsburg, have refused lately to bid, in the hope that some of the Governors of the States would bid in competition with the Government, with no possible result but to raise prices. If you come into the market it will greatly embarrass the Government. The Governors of other States have been notified that purchase of arms or advance stores made otherwise than through the Ordnance Department cannot be sanctioned, nor the money thus expended be reimbursed by the United States. You can see be necessity of this rule.

Assistant Secretary of War.a

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 23, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Our arsenal has supplied a large amount of ammunition to the troops recently sent from here; also to the troops in Kentucky, when the necessity was great within the last few weeks. We have plenty of material on hand except lead. Our advances to the Government are heavy, and as lead is strictly cash we cannot obtain it. Cannot the Government send up 200 tons of lead, the value thereof to be credited on our account for ammunition furnished? General Ripley did last spring for us, to the manifest advantage of the service/

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

His Excellency Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

Two hundred tons lead will be shipped at once. Four thousand five hundred Enfield rifles and 11,100 Austrian guns are ordered to you.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
