Report of the Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
November 26, 1866.
Sib : The revenues of this Department for the
yearendingJune30,1866,were 514,386,986 21,
and the expenditures $15,352,079 30, showing
an excess of the latter of $965,093 09. Anti-
cipating this deficiency, a special appropriation
was made by act of Congress approved July 28,
1S66.
The decrease of revenue compared with the
previous year was one and one fifth per cent.,
and the increase of expenditures twelve per
cent. Including the standing appropriation for
free mail matter, $700,000, as a legitimate por-
tion of the revenues yet remaining unexpended,
the actual deficiency for the past year is only
$205,093 09; within §51,141 of amount esti-
mated in the annual report of 1864.
That portion of the revenues accumulated in
depository and draft offices, under the super-
vision of the "finance office" of this Depart-
ment, was $6,751,655 39; collected by the
Auditor, $2,641,074 38; and retained by post-
masters for salaries and office expenses,
$4,994,256 44.
The estimated expenditures for the year ending Juno
30,1868, are  $17,583,000
The revenue*, estimated at 5
per cent, over last year  $15,106,335
Appropriation for free matter, 700,000
  15,806,335
Excess of expenditures  $1,776,665
For this deficiency no special appropriation
will be required. The standing appropriations
for free matter, unexpended for several years,
are deemed sufficient. The following amounts
will, however, be required from any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated:
For overland mail transportation between Atchison
and Folsom, and for marine mail transportation
between New York and California  $900,000
For steamship service between San Fran-
cisco, Japan, and China, for one year
from Julv 1, 1867   500,000
For steamship service between the United
States and Brazil, for the same period... 150,000
$1,.550,000
For detailed information as to the finances
of the Department reference is made to the
full and satisfactory report of the Auditor,
hereto appended.
The number of postage stamps issued dur-
ing the year was 347,734,325, representing
$10,816,661; stamped envelopes 30,386,200,
representiijg $921,500 50; stamped envelopes
hearing printed cards and requests 7,683,525,
representing $230,006 75; stamped wrappers
1,025,000, representing $20,500; making in all
$11,988,668 25; a decrease of $858,769 25,
compared with the previous year.
The aggregate of stamped envelopes and
stamped wrappers issued during the year ended
June 30, 1866, was 39,094,725, representing
$1,172,007 25; an increase of 12,888,550, rep-
resenting $424,557 25, or nearly fifty per cent.;
being largely in excess of issues during any
previous year since the introduction of stamped
envelopes.
The sale of stamps, envelope*, Jfcc., during
the past year amounted to $12,204,729 54, or
$216,061 29 more than the issues; showing the
absorption to that extent of the stock remain-
ing unsold in the hands of postmasters, which
Bmonnted on the 1st of July, 1865, to $447,710.
The issues of postage stamps and stamped
envelopes during the current fiscal year, from
1st of July to 1st of November, are $360,765
in excess of the issues for the corresponding
period of last year, being at the rate of more
than $1,000,000 per annum. _
The increased demand since 1st July for
envelopes with printed cards and requests for
returning direct to the sender, if not promptly
delivered to the address, is very notable, being
about sixty-six and two thirds per cent. The
general use of such envelopes will tend largely
to reduce the number of dead letters.
During the year sixty-six cases of claim^ on
account of robberies by armed forces, involv-
ing an amount of $4,226 06, have been acted
upon. Fifty-seven of these claims, amounting
to $3,852 04, have been allowed under the pro-
visions of the acts approved April 29, 1864,
and March 3, 1865, and nine, amounting to
$374 02, have been rejected as not coming
within the provisions of the law.
contracts.
There were in the service of the Department
on the 30th of June, 1866, 6,069 contractors for
the transportation of the mails.
Of mail routes in operation there were 6,930;
aggregate length, 180,921 miles; aggregate
annual transportation, 71,837,914 miles; aggre-
gate annualcost, $7,630,474; includingthe com-
pensation of route agents, local agents, mail
messengers, postal railway clerks, and baggage
masters in charge of mails, namely, $779,710,
the aggregate annualcost was $8,410,184. This
service was divided as follows :
Eailroad routes: length, 32,092miles; annual
transportation, 30,609.467 miles; annual cost,-
$3,391,592; about eleven cents per mile. _
Steamboat routes: length, 14,346 miles;
annual transportation, 3,411,962miles; annual
cost, $440,844 ; about thirteen cents per mile.
Celerity, &c.: routes' length, 134,483 miles;
annual transportation, 37,810,485 miles; an-
nualcost, $3,798,038; about ten cents per mile.
The length of routes was increased over the
preceding year 38,581 miles ; the annual trans-
portation, 13,724,420 miles; and the cost,
$1,393,590, the increase arising principally
from the restoration of service in the south-
ern States.
A table herewith annexed shows the rate of
pay per annum for mail transportation in oper-
ation in late insurgent States on the 30th June,
1866, $1,170,529, compared with the amount
due for service actually rendered in those States
in the year ending with that date, $769,218;
the difference, $40,311, resulting from the fact
that much of the service was in operation only
part of the year. The net postal receipts from
those States for the same period being $693,835,
the liabilities (without including the compen-
sation of route agents, local agents, and mail
messengers) exceed the receipts by $75,383.
A table is annexed showing the mail service
in operation in these States September 30,
1866, compared with the condition of the ser-
vice in the same States, November 1, 1865,
the date to which the statements on this sub-
ject were made up in the last annual report.
From this table it will be seen that there are
in operation in the States enumerated ninety
railroad routes, with an aggregate length of
8,170J miles, at a cost of $587,581 per annum;
twenty-six steamboat routes, with an aggregate
length of 5,557 miles, at a cost of $195,665 per
annum; and 1,137 " star service" routes, (celer-
ity, &c.,)-with an aggregate length of 46,442}
miles, at a cost of $1,062,477 54 per annum;
making the whole service now in operation in
these States, of all grades, 1,253 routes, with
an aggregate length of 60,170} miles, at a cost
of $1,845,623 54 per annum. Compared with
the service in operation on the 1st November,
1865, namely, seventy-one railroadroutes, with
an aggregate length of 6,242^ miles, at a cost
of $437,257 per annum ; twelve steamboat
routes, with an aggregate length of 3,869}
miles, at a cost of $93,260 per annum; and
one hundred and fifty-four "star service"
routes, with an aggregate length of 8,186J
miles, at a cost of $177,743 per annum, there
appears an increase of nineteen routes, l,928^j/jjr
miles, and $150,324 annual cost of_railroad
service; fourteen routes, 2,971} miles, and
$102,305 annual cost of steamboat service;
and nine hundred and "eighty-three routes,
38,250} miles, and $884,734 54 annual cost of
"star service;" making a total increase of
1,016 routes, 41,872^ miles, and $1,137,368
54 annual cost.
Another table is annexed showing the num-
ber, termini, and length of southern railroad
routes not in operation September 30, 1866;
the number being only fourteen, and the ag-
gregate length 696^% miles. Comparing this
with ninety routes -in operation, having an
aggregate length of 8,170} miles, shows a
remarkable-progress in the resuscitation of the
railroad system of the South. There being
two thousand two hundred and fifty routes in
all the States enumerated, these statements
show more than half the whole number to be
in operation, comprising nearly nine tenths of
the railroad routes. All the routes in these
States were duly advertised to be let to contract;
apart from 1st January, 1866, and the residue
from 1st July, 1866; but on a large number of
them no proposals were received under the ad-
vertisement, and on many others the bids wero
extravagantly high. In the latter case, offers
of the highest admissible rates were submitted
by the Department to the lowest bidders, and
in some instances negotiations were opened
through special agents, postmasters, and lead-
ing citizens. By all these means combined
the amount of service here stated has been ob-
tained.
The existing contracts in all the States
named, except Tennessee, will expire on the
30th June, 1867. New advertisements, invit-
ing proposals for four years' service from 1st
Julyj 1867, are now being issued, under which
it is hoped all routes of real utility in the whole
section will be let.
By a recent order of the Department, the
overland mail route to California, of which
Atchison, Kansas, had been the initial point,
has been changed so as to have two points of
departure—one from Junction City, Kansas, on
the Union Pacific railroad route, (eastern
division,) running from Wyandotte, Kansas;
and the other from Fort Kearney, Nebraska,
on the Union Pacific railroad route, running
from Omaha City, Nebraska. The lines from
these two points meet at Denver City, in Col-
orado Territory.
The Junction City road connects at Wyan-
dotte with the Pacific railway from St. Louis,
Missouri, making a continuous railway con-
nection with the eastern cities. By this route
the stage travel is diminished one hundred and
sixty-eight miles, and the time occupied in the
transit should be proportionately reduced. The
mails to and from California, which before
were sent via Chicago and St. Joseph, were
consequently ordered, on the 15th ot" August
last, to be sent via St. Louis, Wyandotte, and
Junction City. The reports so far received of
the actual running of the mails since the change
took effect do not show the average diminution
of time in the performance of the through trip
which the Department was led to expect, though,
the capacity of the route for superior expedition
is proved by the fact, that in one or two
instances the mails have been received at New
York in nineteen days from San Francisco, a
day less than the shortest time ever made pre-
vious to the ohange. Subsequently, however,
the extension of the Chicago and Northwestern
railway to Omaha City, which is necessary to
form a continuous line by rail to Fort Kearney,
has become so nearly completed, that on th«
13th of November instant, orders were issued
to forward via Chicago, Omaha City, and Fort
Kearney, all mails destined for the overland
route from the distributing offices at Portland,
Boston, Hartford, Albany, New York, Phila-
delphia, Pittsburg, Buffalo, Cleveland, and
Detroit—the expectation being that mails from
that portion of the country represented by these
distributing offices will find their Quickest
transit by the northern route. .
The preparation of post-route maps for pub-
lication has been continued by the topographer,
and is well advanced. Two sheets, exhibiting
