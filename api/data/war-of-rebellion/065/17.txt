fire was discontinued, but opened again on Monday morning, and will be continued until the fort is thoroughly demolished. This has never been thoroughly done yet, and as far as I can ascertain the lower line of casemates remain intact. I propose to make a breaching cut along the line of lower embrasures and then shake the wall by explosions of large quantities of powder, floated down against the fort on rafts. I shall take these rafts up to-morrow morning. The jails for the rebel prisoners are now made, and they will also be taken up to-morrow, and put at night on Cumming's Point.

I am now collecting the four companies of cavalry, all the cavalry that remains in the department, for the purpose of a raid on the railroad. As the weather is too hot for infantry to march any distance, I propose to land the infantry and cavalry together, and push forward the latter to do its work, while the former holds the landing and advances as far as possible to give support.

The general health of the command is good. The late movements have had a decidedly beneficial effect on the troops, both white and black. The latter, especially, improved every day that they were out, and, I am happy to say, toward the last evinced a considerable degree of pluck and good fighting qualities. I am now relieved of apprehension as to this class of troops, and believe, with active service and drill, they can be made thorough soldiers.

I have the honor be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., July 17, 1864.

GENERAL: I have nothing of interest to report since my letter of the 12th. The fire upon Fort Sumter has been kept up, slowly and with marked effect. A breach which appears practicable has been made near the right gorge angle. We are now demolishing the left gorge angle, where the rebels have their magazine containing the small supply of ammunition left in the fort. I shall try the mine rafts as soon as I can go up there and arrange the details for locating and firing them. I would like very much to receive your sanction to the occupation of this fort, which, I think, can be done with little loss of life.

I am preparing to make an attack on the railroad and afterward on a point near Savannah. I am, however, not able to make these moves as rapidly as I desire for want of proper and sufficient transportation, of which I have made full reports. I will do the best I can. The jails are now being erected on Morris Island, and as soon as ready will receive the prisoners in my hands.

The health of the command of is good.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff.
