Gen. Silas Casey, U. S. Army. commanding Third Division, Fourth Corps. HEADQUARTERS CASEYS DIVISION, June 16, 1862. CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that yesterday a cavalry de. tachment ordered by me on a reconnaissance encountered near New Market a rebel picket of about 12 mounted men. They succeeded in capturing 1 of their horses and 2 carbines. They also brought in a man named Nathan Doughty, who has been engaged in collecting negroes to work on the fortifications near Richmond. I would respect- fully call attention to the insecurity of this part of the line. My geii- eral officers of the day report a number of fording places not heretofore known to us. In fact, in dry weather the places across the swamp that cannot be easily forded are exceptions. A sufficient force of cavalry should be kept here, that the borders of the swamp from the Chicka- hominy may be constantly watched. I also request that an officer of engineers may be sent to make an examination of the swamp. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, SILAS CASEY, Brigadier- General Volunteers, Commanding Division.
