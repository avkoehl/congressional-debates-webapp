I desire to call the attention of the general commanding to the bravery, self-possession, and energy of Lieutenant Colonel F. E. Pierce, commanding One hundred and eighth New York Volunteers, who, throughout the heaviest of the fire, showed the greater unconcern, passing along his line and encouraging his men; Major John T. Hill, commanding Twelfth New Jersey Volunteers, who directed his men to retain their fire during the charge of the enemy until they were within 20 yards, when, at his command, so tremendous a fire of buck and ball was poured into their ranks as to render it impossible that one of them could reach the breastwork; Major Theodore G. Ellis, commanding Fourteenth Connecticut Volunteers, who led the last attack on the house and barn occupied by the enemy's sharpshooters in a very spirited manner, completely routing them, and Lieutenant William Smith, who commanded the First Delaware Volunteers during the attack upon our front. He was a brave and efficient officer, and was instantly killed, with one of the enemy's captured flags in his hand. I would also particularly mention the able and efficient services of the gentlemen composing my staff: Lieutenant William P. Seville, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain James Parker Postles, acting assistant inspector-general, and Lieutenant Charles S. Schaeffer, aide-de-camp, who was wounded, and Lieutenant Theron E. Parsons, aide-de-camp. These officers are deserving of much credit for their conduct during the whole action. Lieutenant William P. Seville and Captain J. P. Postles I wish specially to recommend to your notice as really meritorious officers.

THOS. A. SMITH,

Colonel First Delaware Volunteers, Comdg, Brigade.

Captain GEORGE P. CORTS, assistant Adjutant-General.
