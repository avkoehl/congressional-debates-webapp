Fayetteville to Van Buren is held by several hundred bushwhackers, and this officially, and if this is so 100 men would be no better than 25 to guard such a train. So I think we will not order troops down at present, but you will confer with Colonel Harrison and see if he will not assistant to get these people out. Captain Hughes with his detachment may remain Fayetteville while some of Colonel Harrison's troops go to Van Buren to assist Bowlin, if that will do. Have Harrison inform us as soon as the large force of bushwhackers has withdrawn. Keep scouts well out toward Fayetteville.

Lieutenant-Colonel CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

If you cannot furnish escort for the train delay it till to-morrow, when Captain Hughes will be there with fifty men escorting down horses for the First Arkansas. Have all go on together with a large escort. The reason why a large cavalry force of 200 or 300 cannot be used at that point is that I have not got them and cannot get them. Raise a company of infantry there for six months if you can. Will not Captain Godely and his company muster into the six-months' regiment? Have him do so if you can induce him.

Lieutenant-Colonel CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville:

Captain Hughes will not at present be detained at Fayetteville, but with re-enforcements from there will push on to Cowskin Prairie as rapidly as possible. Major Burch has retired before that force with 150 men under his command.

You will send Captain McCabe with his company and all its camp and garrison equipage to the post of Springfield immediately. You will call Captain Rubey's company into active service at your post at once. If they are ready to muster I will have the assistant commissary of musters come down and muster them.
