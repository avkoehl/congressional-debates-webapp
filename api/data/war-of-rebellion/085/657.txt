HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, October 6, 1864.

Major- General CURTIS:

You will wish to know our latest news. Ewing blew up Pilot Knob and made god retreat to Rolla with is battery, losing only killed, wounded, and stragglers by the way. Price was reported crossing the Gasconade yesterday on the old State road to Jefferson City. McNeil and Sanborn finding their aim moved with their mounted force to Jefferson City.

Will hurt General Price decidedly*

HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, October 6, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans:

General not in. Price is crossing the 	Osage; his advance is skirmishing with cavalry from Jefferson City. Can you patrol the river with light- draught boats to prevent parties of guerrilas from crossing north! If you can spare cavalry they can be of great service west of Jefferson City; if infantry they can be sent by boat to Jefferson City. McNeil has 2,500 cavalry near Jefferson City to- day. We will send 9,000 infantry up the river to- morrow or next day.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 6, 1864- 11 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Few boats and low water prevent my doing much. Have armed boat on river; will start another in the morning. Have called out militia and will do all I can. Fisk telegraphs that he holds the enemy at the Moreau to- night. A few killed and wounded. Push forward you forces to- night. Delay is disastrous.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-Genera.
