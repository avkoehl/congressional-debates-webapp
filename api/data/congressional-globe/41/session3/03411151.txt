JOHN PREYEAUX.
Mr. WILLARD also, from the same commit-
tee, reported a bill (H. R. No. 3003) granting a
pension to John Preveaux, a citizen of Ames-
burg, Massachusetts ; which was read a first
and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill authorizes and requires the Secre-
tary of the Interior to place the name of John
Preveaux, late a private in Captain Whitney's
company, first regiment of artillery, upon the
pension-roll, and pay him a pension at the
rate of eight dollars per month from the date
of the passage of this bill.
The report was read.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. WILLARD moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
REUBEN THOMAS AND GEORGE BROWN.
Mr. WILLARD also, from the same commit-
tee, reported a bill (H. It. No. 3004) for the
relief of Iteuben Thomas and George Brown;
which was read a first and second time.
The question was upou ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill was read in full. It directs the
Secretary of the Interior to restore to the pen-
sion-rolls and to their former rights as pen-
sioners Reuben Thomas, of Jefferson county,
iÂ« the State of Tennessee, and George Brown,
of Johnson county in the same State, their
names having been stricken from the roll dur-
ing the late rebellion, the parties to receive
from the date of the passage of this act pen-
sions at the same rate paid them before their
names were stricken from the pension-roll.
Mr. KELSEY. What committee reports
this bill ?
The SPEAKER. The Committee on Rev-
olutionary Pensions and War of 1812.
Mr. KELSEY. These men were stricken
from the rolls for disloyalty, were they not?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman in charge
of the bill can answer that question. It is not
a parliamentary question.
Mr. WILLARD. There is a report accom-
panying the- bill, and I ask that it may be
read.
The report upon the petition of Reuben
Thomas was read. It states that Reuben
Thomas, of Jefferson county, Tennessee, was
receiving at the beginning of the rebellion a
pension at the rate of eight dollars a month
for services during the war of 1812. Being in
a State which was in rebellion, his name was
stricken from the pension-roll. A petition for
his restoration to the pension-roll is signed by
a large number of his neighbors and by prom-
inent officials of Jefferson county. It states
that, led by his sons, he sympathized with the
late rebellion ; that otherwise he did nothing
to aid the rebellion, and that since the war
he has acted with the Union party in Bast
Tennessee. It states further, that he is old,
feeble, and poor.
Mr. KELSEY. 1 hope this bill will not
pass. I do not want to open the door to let in
claims from all these men who were drawing
pensions from the Government and went off
into the rebellion, giving it aid and comfort.
I do not want that we shall go back upon our
own record. I think the bill should not pass.
Mr. WILLARD. These two cases are the
only ones that have been presented to our
committee asking for a restoration to the' pen-
sion-rolls. These two men are too old to have
taken any part whatever in the late rebellion.
They live in East Tennessee, and each of
them, I believe, had a son in the rebellion.
All the evidence there is in respect to their
disloyalty is that they probably had the natural
sympathy of a father for his child, and so far
sympathized with the rebellion. But there
was no evidence before the committee from
any source, and the committee had no reason
to suppose, that these old pensioners gave any
aid or comfort whatever to the rebellion.
Their names were stricken from the rolls, as
were the names of all pensioners in the south-
ern States, without any previous examination
as to their loyalty.
Mr. BEAMAN. Was there any evidence
of their loyalty ?
Mr. WILLARD. Their names were stricken
from the rolls without any preliminary trial,
without any evidence being produced of their
disloyalty. Their case in that respect is like
the case of every pensioner in the southern
States of the war of 1812.
Let me say further, that, on the evidence, I
deem that this case comes precisely within the
limitation of the general bill which has passed
the House-and the Senate, and which bill pro-
vides that all the soldiers of the war of 1812
who gave aid and comfort to the rebellion, or
who held office under the confederate govern-
ment, should not have the benefit of that bill.
But it does not provide that those who might
in any way, from natural feeling, have sym-
pathized with their children who were in the
rebellion should be denied the benefits of the
bill.
Mr. KELSEY. Then, if I understand the
gentleman rightly, these men did sympathize
with the rebellion.
