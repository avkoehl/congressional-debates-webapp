Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Eastport, February 4, 1865.

Bvt. Major General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry, Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Colonel Mackay, chief quartermaster Army of the Cumberland, reports the arrival at this place of ninety artillery horses which he describes as being under size for the purpose. The major-general commanding directs me to inform you of the arrival of these horses, and to state that if you wish them to be given to the division of cavalry ordered south, they can be thus disposed of to mount some of the dismounted men of that division. He directs that you send an officer of the quartermaster's department to receipt for and take charge of the animals if they are wanted. He further directs that the division of dismounted cavalry (General Hatch's) be prepared to move down on the other side of the river, reporting on arrival opposite to this place, to be moved at once across the river. This he thinks will be the most expeditious mode for the division to come, as the chief quartermaster can move them rapidly across the river on arrival.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY M. CIST,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
