Major General JOSEPH HOOKER,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your letter of yesterday, requesting permission to send a burial party to attend to your dead and wounded on the battle-field of Chancellorsville. I regret that their position is such, being immediately within our lines, that the necessities of war forbid my compliance with your request, which, under other circumstance, it would give me pleasure to grant. I will accord to your dead and wounded the same attention, which I bestow upon my own; but if there is anything which your medical director here requires which we cannot provide, he shall have my permission to receive from you such medical supplies as you may think proper to furnish. Consideration for your wounded prompts me to add that, from what i learn, their comfort would be greatly promoted by additional medical attendance and medical supplies.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
