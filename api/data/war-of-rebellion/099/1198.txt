bridge and to enfilade it. Construct works on this side to keep enemy's batteries as far from city as possible. The city must then be held as long as circumstances will permit to give time to our re-enforcements to arrive. When forced back retire toward Winnsborough.

I will see you in the morning.

AUGUSTA, GA., February 15, 1865.

Major N. W. SMITH,

Chief Inspector, Field Transportation:

MAJOR: I wish to place 1,000 or 1,500 men on the Edgefield plank road, about ten miles from the city, to guard approach in that direction. It will be impossible to do so without wagons for supplies and baggage. What can you do toward supplying Stewart's corps so that it may move as soon as concentrated?

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,February 15, 1865.

Colonel Hannon's brigade, with the exception of 100 men, is ordered off to-morrow. The force left is directed to watch your front and to report to you for orders.

Respectfully,
