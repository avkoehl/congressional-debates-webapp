CUMBERLAND GAP,

September 10, 1863.

Captain ANDERSON:

All well. This place surrendered unconditionally to-day. Over 3,000 prisoners

and 14 pieces of artillery. Please make full report of affairs at headquarters. Remember me to your wife, mother, father, and brother.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, September 10, 1863.

General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Cumberland Gap:

Your success gives universal joy, and the news reached us at the same time with that of Rosecrans' occupation of Chattanooga. All quiet here. The disloyal men seemed desirous of a collision, but no considerable disturbance has occurred. Willcox says he has information that Vallandigham will try to return about the 15th. I have ordered that he be sent to Fort Warren at once, if he comes within the department. His friends threaten an uprising to meet him, but I doubt their nerve. A draft a little over 12,000 men from Ohio is said to be ordered, but we have no official information of it.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

CLEVELAND, OHIO, September 10, 1863.

Major ECKERT:

Operator at Crab Orchard states that line was working to Cumberland Gap yesterday, but not working at hour Secretary's message received. Same operator states that Cumberland Gap surrendered to General Burnside yesterday afternoon, 4 o'clock, without firing a gun. Expect further advices soon.

A. STAGER.
