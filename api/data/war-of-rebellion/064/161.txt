Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, La.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report, in compliance with instructions from department headquarters this date, and the letter of the 31st ultimo from Lieutenant-Colonel Abert, assistant inspector-general, that the organization and distribution of depots and commissaries of subsistence in the Department of the Gulf to-day are as follows: The main depot of subsistence for the department is in this city under the charge of an efficient officer, as is that, also, for the issue of provisions on returns in this city, and the duties of both are well and promptly done. The Nineteenth Army Corps, if not increased at Morganza, La., is well provided with a capable and efficient corps of commissaries of subsistence, well organized, and in good working order. Lieutenant Colonel H. D. Woodruff, commissary of subsistence of volunteers, is its chief, and he has 5 commissaries of subsistence of volunteers as assistants.

With the Thirteenth Corps there are but 2 commissaries of volunteers with the rank of captain. One is without any business experience or capacity whatever; the other is very efficient and capable. The depot at Port Hudson is in charge of a capable officer; that at Baton Rouge is temporarily in charge of a lieutenant detailed to it from the Thirtieth Massachusetts Volunteers. One of the commissaries of subsistence returned from the Red River service will be immediately assigned to it. The depot at Carrollton is in charge of apparently as honest and incapable an officer as ever had charge of important public business. Should a considerable part of the Thirteenth Army Corps be stationed there I hope to have the services of a more competent officer for that depot. At present I have not any officer to replace the present incumbent.

There are commissaries of subsistence of volunteers at Fort Barrancas, at Brazos, and at Brownsville. All other stations, posts, and organizations in the department are subsisted by detailed acting commissaries of subsistence, Additional commissaries of subsistence of volunteers are greatly needed here, but I have so often and
