Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Cavalry DIVISION:

Upon receipt of this you will leave a sufficient force to protect the immediate line from Jacksonville to the Coosa and collect all the force you can and move on the road between the Etowah and Chattahoochee. General Hood thinks such a movement would, in a great measure, protect the line you are now on, and it is of the first importance that part of the railroad should be destroyed. Do all you can to damage the road. Our trains are supplying us from Jacksonville, via Edward's Ferry.
