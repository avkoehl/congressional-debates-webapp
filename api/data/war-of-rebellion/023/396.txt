BATTLE CREEK, August 23, 1862.

General BUELL:

McCook is encamped on Battle Creek, 6 miles from the mouth. The scouts send out last night to the Durham road have not returned. No further reliable information of the enemy.

BATTLE CREEK, August 23, [1862].

General BUELL:

William Allen, who says he is employed by you, sent a man that I know, a true man, from Walden's Ridge to General McCook. He came to Mr. Allen; says Bragg's headquarters are at Dew Valley, 6 miles from Chattanooga. Enemy, 150,000 strong, had nearly all crossed at Chattanooga, Igou's and Blythe's Ferries, with 1,000 wagons, to concentrate at McMinnville.

L. A. HARRIS,

Colonel.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

General McCOOK, via Battle Creek:

Suspend your march, but be ready to march to-night. Will send your orders in a few minutes.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 23, 1862.

General McCOOK, via Battle Creek:

March to Tracy City, and there form a junction with Schoepf by 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. Then march to Altamont, so as to form a junction with Thomas to-morrow night. I shall probably join you to-morrow morning with Sill's brigade, but at any rate move forward so as to intercept the enemy and attack him on the Therman road. I think you had better not take more than two batteries; more than that will encumber you. Send the rest to this place under an infantry escort; two companies will, I think, be sufficient. Select a position for a regiment of infantry and two pieces of artillery best calculated to guard the pass from Jasper to this place-I suppose near where you are.

The regiment and artillery will be one of those left at Battle Creek, which I will designate. Send some one to guide them and point out the position. Let there be no mistake about the road and no failure. Report exactly the road you will take and any other information.

Schoepf has a report that Hardee is marching on McMinnville by the Dunlap road. Is your previous information confirmed? You should at least know whether the enemy has entered Sequatchie Valley.

D. C. BUELL.

BATTLE CREEK, August 23, 1862.

General BUELL:

Your dispatch just received. I understand it. I will move as ordered, but fear I cannot make Tracy City by 10 a. m.; will do the best. When
