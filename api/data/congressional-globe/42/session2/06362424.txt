THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 13,
at Washington with the Choctaws and Chick-
asaws, of April 28, 1866, provides that—
"The Choctaw and Chickasaw nations shall de-
liver np persons accused of crime against the United
States, or any of them, who may be found within
their limits, on the requisition of the Governor of
any State, or of the United States."
The seventh article of the treaty of Wash-
ington, made July 19, 1866, with the Chero-
kees, provides that—
"The United States court to be created in the In-
dian territory,and until such courtiscreated therein
the United States district court the nearest to the
Cherokee nation, shall have exclusive original juris-
diction of ail causes, civil .and criminal, wherein
an inhabitant of the district hereinbefore described
shall be a party, and where an inhabitant outside of
said district in the Cherokee country shall be the
other party plaintiff or defendant in a civil cause,
or shall be a defendant or prosecutor in a criminal
case," &o.
The seventh section of th« tenth article of
the Greek treaty made at Washington, June
1-4, 1806, provides that—
" The Creeks also agree that a court or courts may
be established in said territory with such jurisdiction
and organized in such manner as Congress may by
law provide."
The eighth section of the eighth article of
the Choctaw and Chickasaw treaty, of April
28, 186(5, provides that—
"The Choctaws and Chickasaws also agree that
a court or courts may be established in said ter-
ritory with such jurisdiction and organization as
Congress may prescribe: Provided, That the same
shall not interfere with the local judiciary of either
of said nations."
This provision is also contained In the prior
treaty with these tribes, of June 22, 1855, arti-
cle fifteen of that treaty.
The seventh section of the seventh article
of the Seminole treaty, of March 21, 186G,
provides that—
"The Seminoles also agree that a court or courts
mny be established in said territory, with such
jurisdiction and organized in such manner as Con-
gress may by jaw provide,"
PROVISION FOE REFUGEES WHO SUFFERED ON" ACCOUNT
OF THEIR DBVOTION TO THIS UNITED STATES DURING
THE REBELLION.
The Seminoles in their treaty at Washington
of March 21, I860, provide in the latter clause
of the fourth article that—
" Tho provisions of this artieleshall extend to and
embrace the claims for losses sustained by loyal
members of said tribe, irrespective of race or color
whether at tho timo of said losses the claimants
shnll have been in servitude or not; provided said
claimants are made members of this tribe by the
stipulation of this treaty."
By the forty ninth article of the Washington
treaty of April 28, 1800, with the Choctaws ami
Chickasaws, it is expressly provided—
"And it is further agreed that a commission to
consist of a person or persons, to bo appointed by
the President of the United States, shall be ap-
pointed immediately on the ratification of this treaty,
who shall take into consideration and determine the
claim of such Choctaws and Chickasaws as allege
that they have been driven during the late rebel-
lion from their homes in the Choctaw and Chicka-
saw nations on account of tbeii adhesion to the
United States, for damages, with power to make
such award as may be consistent with equity and
good conscience, taking into view all the circuui-
stanecs, whose report, when ratified by the Secre-
tary of the Interior, shall be final, and authorize
the payment of tho amount from any moneys of
said nations in the hands of the United States as
the said commission may award."
The fourth article of the Creek treaty of
Washington, June 14, 1866, provides thai—
*' Immediately after tho ratification of this treaty
the United States agree to ascertain the amount duo
the respective soldiers who enlisted in the Federal
Army, loyal retugee Indians and freedmen, m pro-
portion to their several losses, and to pay the
amount awarded each, in the following manner, to
wit: a census of the Creeks shall be taken by the
agent of the United States for said nation, under the
direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and a roll
of the names of all s-oldiers that enlisted in tho
Federal Army, loyal refugee Indians, and freedmen,
be made by hun.
The superintendent of Indian affairs for thesouth-
eru superintendency. and the agent of the United
States tor the Creek natiou, shall proceed to invest-
igate and determine from said roil tho amounts due
the respective refugee Indiana and &huli transmit
to theCommi?sionerof Indian Allan's for his approval,
and that of the Secretary of the Interior, their
awards, togetherwith their reasons therefor. Tn case
tho awards so made shall be duly approved, said
awards shall be paid from the procoedsof tho sale of
said lands within one yearfrom the ratification of this
treaty, or so soon as said amount of 8100,000 can be
raised from tho sale of said land to other Indians."
The third article of the Cherokee treaty
made at Washington July 19, 1866, provides
with less liberality, however, for the restora-
tion of property to tho returned refugee Cher-
okees.
These several treaty provisions present in a
most favorable light the generosity of these
people, and test their worth and civilization,
pointing them, out, not as outlaws from whom
we should take that which we have sold to
them for a consideration, and for which we
have received our price long since, but of
whom we could with great safety learn many
lessons of national faith and devotion to jus-
tice and charitable dealing with our fellows.
PROHIBITION OF INTEMPERANCE.
Another evidence of a desire for progress
and good order is manifested among these
people by their of t-repeated stipulations against
the introduction of spirituous liquors among
them. Their great love for it as a beverage
makes the prohibition of its introduction the
more virtuous as a self denial, and would
among white men call for the highest en-
comiums for firmness and moral worth. Of
course I speak of the better-thinking classes
of the Indians, and must do so in regard to
any other people whose virtues are being con-
sidered, as there are careless and dissolute
men in every society who add nothing to its
fame or its progress.
The twenty-seventh article of the Cherokee
treaty of Washington, made July 19, 1866,
provides, among other things—
" But no sutler or other person connected there-
with, either in or out of the military organization,
shall be permitted to introduce any spirituous, vin-
ous, or malt liquors into the Cherokee nation, ex-
cept the medical department proper, and by them
only for strictly medical purposes."
All Indian tribes, by their treaties, author-
ize the United States to pass such laws regu-
lating internal trade and commerce among the
several tribes as in the judgment of Congress is
proper, and in pursuance of this understanding
the law of June 30, 183-1, entitled "An act to
regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian
tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontier,
was passed." The twentieth section of this
intercourse act provides—
"That if any person shall sell, exchange, or give,
barter^or disposeof any spirituous liquor or wine to
an Indian in the Indian country, such peison shall
forfeit and pay tho sum of $500; and if any person
shall introduce, or attempt to introduce, anyspiritu-
ous liciuor or wine into the Indian country, except
such supplies as shall be necessary for the olhcers
of the United States and troops of tho service,
under the direction of the War Department, such i
person shall forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding
#300; and if any superintendent of Indian affairs,
Indian agent, or sub-agent, or commanding officer
of a military post has reason to suspect, or is in-
formed, that any white person or Indian is about to
introduce, or ha-* introduced, any spirituous liquor or
wine into the Indian country, in violation of the
provisions ot this section, it shall be lawful for such
superintendent, Indian agent, or sub-agent, or mili-
tary officer, agreeably to such regulations as may be
established by the President of the United States, to
cause the boats, stores, packages, and places of de-
posit of such person to be searched, and if any such
spirituous liauor or wine .is found the goods, boats,
packages, and peltries of such person shall be seized
and delivered to the proper officer, and shall be
proceeded against by libel in the proper court and
forfeited, one half fotheinfbruierandtheother half
to the use of the United States, and if such person is a
trader his license shall be revoked and his bond put
in suit. And it shall moreover be lawful for any
person in tne service of the United States, or for any
Indian, to take and destroy any ardent spiiits or
wine found in the Indian country, except military
supplies, as mentioned in this section."
POWEK GRANTED TO CONGRESS TO LEGISLATE.
I now call attention to the powers granted
Congress under the treaties of 1866, to legis-
late for the interest of the several fugitive
tribes in the Indian territory, together with
their restrictions.
It is provided by article seven of the Choc-
taw and Chickasaw treaty of Washington,
April 28, 1866, that—
"The Choctaws and Chickasaws a,gree to such
legislation as Congress and the President of the
United States may deem necessary for the better
administration of justice and the protection of the
rights of person and property within the Indian
territory: Provided, however, Such legislation shall
not in any wise interfere with or annul th~ir pres-
ent tribal organization or their respective legisla-
tures or judiciaries, or the rights, laws, privileges
or customs of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations
respectively."
The tenth article of the Creek treaty made at
Washington, June 14, 1866, provides in the
same terms of that of the Choctaws and Chicka-
saws touching the power of Congress and the
President to legislate ■' for the better admin-
istration of justice and the protection of per-
son and property within the Indian territory,"
aud with the same restrictive provisions '"to
not in any manner interfere with or annul
their present tribal organization, rights, laws,
privileges, and customs."
It is provided in the seventh article of the
Seminole treaty made at Washington, March
21, 1866, that ''the Seminole nation agrees to
such legislation as Congress and the President
may deem necessary for the better administra-
tion of the rights of person and property within
the Indian territory;" with the same provis-
ions as to non-interference with the "tribal
organization, rights, laws, privileges, and cus-
toms."
The Cherokees made no special provisions
in their treaty of 1866 on the subject of con-
gressional legislation, but the affirmation of
all former treaties not inconsistent with that
one leaves all former authority touching the
power of Congress as it was, so that the inter-
course laws or the power to make or amend
them is fully authorized with this or with the
other enumerated tribes and as with all tribes
in all the States and Territories of the United
States.
But the title of the Choctaws, Chickasaws,
Creeks, and Cherokees to their present homes
is as sacred as the laws of Congress and treaty
stipulations can make it, and nas been sanc-
tioned in many ways through a period of nearly
ninety consecutive years.
GENERAL COUNCIL OF OKLAHOMA.
It is provided by the seventh article of the
Seminole treaty of March 21, 1866; the eighth
article of the Choctaw and Chickasaw treaty
of April 28, 1866; the tenth article of the
Creek treaty of June 14,1866; and the twelfth
article of the Cherokee treaty of July 19,
1806—
" That a general council, consisting of delegates
elected by each nation or tribe lawfully residing
within the Indian territory, may be annually con-
vened in said territory, which council shall be or-
ganized in sueh manner and possess such powers as
are by their treaties above prescribed."
CENSUS.
These several treaties and sections provide
for the taking, by the Secretary of the Interior,
prior to the first meeting of said council, of a
census or enumeration of each tribe lawfully
resident in said territory, under the direction
of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
GENERAL COUNCIL ELECTION.
Article seven of the Seminole treaty of 1866,
article eight of the Choctaw and Chickasaw
treaty of April 28, 1866. article ten of the
Creek treaty of June 14,1866. and the twelfth
article of the Cherokee treaty of July 19,1866,
severally provide for representation and the
election of members of the general council, a
representation republican in form, and show-
ing evident progress, copying after our Govern-
ment in all respects. These provisions are:
"The first general council shall consist of one
member from each tribe, an additional member
from each one thousand Indians, or each fraction
of a thousand greater than five hundred, being
members of any tribe lawfully resident in said tor-
ritory, and shall be elected by said tribes respect-
ive^. * * * * * * *
The said council shall be presided over by the
superintendent of Indian affairs, or, in case of his
absence for any cause, the duties of said superin-
tendent enumerated by this article shall be per-
formed by sucn person as the Secretary of the
interior may direct.
'' The Secretary of the Interior is to appoint a sec-
retary for the general council, whose duty it shall
be to keep an accurato record of all the proceed-
