MAJOR: I respectfully report that I left my camp this morning about 10 o'clock, moving out in rear of General John E. Smith. I marched two of my brigades in rear, and that portion of my column was also covered by the Seventh Illinois Cavalry,* that reported to me before starting. I was not molested to any extent by the rebel cavalry, none making themselves manifest during the day's march. Reaching my present camp at 4 this p. m., I halted and encamped my division in accordance with directions received. I have sent my ambulance and ordnance trains as well as my battery across Falling Creek, encamping them beyond the stream. My headquarters are on the roadside about a quarter of a mile from the bridge. Inclosed please find list of casualties for the 21st and 22nd instant.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
