HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1864.

With regard to the affair of yesterday I can only say at present that the Third Brigade made as gallant a charge as ever was made. It relieved one of Carlin's brigades, which was used up, and passed to the front of it. Then it charged into the woods without any troops either right or left moving with it, and a large interval on the left. It carried two lines of works and took 2 regimental colors and 1 battery flag; likewise 4 cannon. Almost immediately after getting the works, General Morgan, on the right, came forward to the same line, and as Este had to move to the left the guns fell into the hands of General Morgan's troops. I think 600 men, at least, were captured on the front of this brigade, but in falling to the rear many were taken up by offices of regiments lying behind, and we do not have them to report. The brigade went into the flight with about 1,100 men, and lost 75 killed, and 271 wounded, about 50 supposed mortally. I lost many good officers, and all behaved magnificently. I will give further particulars as soon as possible. This brigade started the movement of the line, which had completely stopped before we came up, and it did actually carry the intrenchments of the enemy with the bayonet, using it all along the line with more freedom than I have ever seen it done. Very many were bayoneted.
