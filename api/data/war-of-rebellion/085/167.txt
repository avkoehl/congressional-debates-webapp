Brigadier-General BROWN:

I have reliable information that there is a lot of bushwhackers east of here on railroad track. They fired on citizens this morning.

W. D. WILSON,

Lieutenant, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Warrensburg, September 12, 1864.

Lieutenant W. D. WILSON,

Knobnoster:

The general commanding desires more definite information. How many bushwhackers are reported and how far from your station? If they are not too strong for you to attack take every man you have and move on them. Call out the citizens to hold the town during your absence. Answer at once.

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOBNOSTER, September 12, 1864.

Captain J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I obtained my information from Mr. Cooper, whose brother they killed a few weeks ago. He says they were seven miles east on the railroad; he could make no estimate of numbers. I have but nine men here with me that could go, as W. E. Chester has the rest of my men in search of a horse thief, by order of Captain Ferguson, but if you desire that I should attack them please let me know soon.

W. D. WILSON,

Lieutenant, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Warrensburg, September 12, 1864.

Lieutenant W. D. WILSON,

Knobnoster:

Move out at once, and if imprudent to attack ascertain their number and movements. In future do not wait for orders in cases of this kind.

By command of Brigadier-General Brown:

J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
