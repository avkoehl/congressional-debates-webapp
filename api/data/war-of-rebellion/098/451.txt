In concluding this report I can testify to the cheerful department of officers and men during this long and arduous campaign. It has fallen to the lot of Bvt. Brigadier General George P. Buell, commanding Second Brigade, to render more important service than any other brigade commander, as he has constructed nearly all the bridges on our line of march.

I wish to return my thanks to all my staff officers for their efficient and intelligent action. Captain Fred. L. Clark, assistant quartermaster, deserves special mention as a quartermaster. Captain E. F. Deaton and Surg. R. F. Dyer have kept their respective departments in perfect order. Captain J. E. Edmonds, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain Isaac Brinkworth and Lieutenant Benham, aides-de-camp; Captain Taylor, inspector, and Lieutenant Putnam, provost-marshal, have all done their whole duty.

For further information I respectfully refer to reports of brigade and regimental commanders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. CARLIN,

Brigadier-General.
