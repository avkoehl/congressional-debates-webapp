domestic slavery was but a hollow and hypocritical pretext, to
covet political designs The slaveholding population and the
<hvehoIding po meal communities may be multiplied by the
pi oponed acquisition of termor-}, hut I do not see that slaveiy

you may, you can oniy ha\e those you now have and then
natural inerea«e Ihey may bed (fused over a v*ide) suiface,
intenrnngled with alargei free population but not oneaddi
tional slive can be made Nay Mi President, this annexation
will pioduct the precise opposite result It will prevent the
increase of slaves
It is well known that it has tasked the vigilance and povtej
of this Government to enforce the laws to which I have just al
laded, against the temptation ol the vast profit which would
lewird the introduction of slaves and it is also t-nown that the
combined en^rues of the civilued Poweis of the wold have
not > et succeeded in putting an end to the Mav< tidde which
continues to supply the West Indict with African =lave< Om
laws, sustmied by our publie opinion and enfniced bv om
powt t v. ould no doubt prevent tlie possibility of the furfhei m
tioduction of n¡ Toes But none of these checks wdl optiatc
with the same lorce upon Texas hei extended eoist watched
byasmall nivy hei uninhabited tennoiy subject to meces

them will be gi cater than any othei poition ol this contmnit
hascver been expo ed to, not sn, will the piopcsed annexation
deteriorate the uindition of the slaves now held in bondage
Suoh as would be tiansfeiied to Texas would be placed

would be less cjowded together in Ipige ma&sec-, an i
from the enhanced value of their laboi, enlist a more intense

how blind and mistaken is that humanity which has peimittel
itself to be enlisted against this measure How nai low it also

distinguished, and at leas as able as himself—a member who •*
hi the habit of personal speak,m<r, and who is entitled to the
same privilege of debate upon thi^ ileor, and at this rime t ta
any other member enjoys
My colleague prefaced his persoi al attack upon me with ano
ther remarkable statement He aid hat fot me, ¡ ersonali},
he had no other than kind feelings ihis was a to eti^ra ia
tuitoue deüaraüon on his p^rf I have ueit ei courted h t.
fiiendship nor his kind lemings But I n ay i\ hat ^o ia «s
pirsona! ennrtesj uideiviuty mayge,! ha\edc«erveel his kind
leelmgs My colleague s residence and m> own, m Tennessee,
are separa ted by a considerable distance    I have nevei been as
sociated with him in any public body before we met upon this
floor, nor have I eithei seen or known much of him in private
life What I at any time have heaxd others 8ayofhim,didftot
seem to preclude those civilities which it is convenient to ex-
enátoa colleague, and which are ordinarily due to agentleman
on this floor ¡have, therefore, beea uniformly courteous tú
him But my colleague had no sooner made ÉhiS pWessiofc pf
kind feeling than he entered upon an airangcdand jpremeái,
tated peisonal attack upon my whole course It must hare
been evident to all who heard him, from the materials he had
at command, and the manner m which they were set forth, that
he enjoyed the benefit of the counsel and experience of others
better versed m the history and politics of the times, and that
thobe pai us of hisspeecn which did not an&e naturally out of the
pieceding discussion, had bsen carefully concocted and laid up
for '•ome suitable occasion for bringing them forth But I will
to my colleague the ci edit to say, thai it is not his own gall
*"whieh he has vented against me upon this occasion He ca"
not have any malignant feeling to gratify against me, nbi, on thó
othei hand, can I entertain any feeling of leseitmem against
him, though I cannot have any respect for him He haebe
come a vohmlaiy scavenger loi other men's uses He has
shown him el! the fit and apt comh t for the discharge, upon
this fiooi, oí the hoauled and accumulated malice and vinthc-
tivtiness of others I know the tource of this attack^ and the
men by whose piomptmgmy colleague speaks I refer to ufo
othei colleagues oi mine, one in another body, m the other end
of tlie Capí ol, and the othei a member of this House They
ne both the ¡nttrrate associates nftny colleague before me I
have 1 nown them both long and well, both m public and th pri
vate life, and I ha\e evei found them alike destitute of private
honoi and pub! c principle Their hypocrisy, their mali^nityj
md'hen tieaeheiy towards me are well understood They
have long sought to traduce my chaiacter through other chan
neis, but theyhavenevei dared to meet me to my face, here or
elsewhere, with their charges What I hare here saiá of them
I have often said befoie I have denounced their conduct to
waidb me, heretofore upon this floor I have repeatedly de
nounoed them at home, in public assemblies of the people,
among then own neighbois in their own vicinity, and where
they h id repeated opportunities to make their charges openly,
and when I could rej ly to them, but they nevei had the Courage
to do so Ttiey nevei daied to meet me These are theauthors
o* the present attack upon me But 1 repeat that I can enter
{pin no fee mg of resentment or tevenge against my colleague
before me Jn (he pail he has acted litre I regard him as the
i leieinstiument of other men's malice—a tool of tools
[Mr Ttrney, who occupied a seat immediately m front of
Mi Bell iobe fiom his seat, and turning round to him,said "it
is f tit, , the statement is false, and my colleague knows it to be
so Mi Bell instantly struck him with his hand, and some

a tn (hat anxiety has been so earner- ly expressed by some of

it was due to the ir ends with wnom 1 ha\ e so long acted, here
and elsewhere, that u is dt e to the pr neiples which I profese,
and which I have uniformly supported on this floor, and. abeve
all f t it is due to m; own feehi gs ai d to my own honor, that
I should answer the vaiious charges wh ch my colleague has
