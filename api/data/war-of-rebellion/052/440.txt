You will find the country for 40 miles below you pretty rough and badly devastated; after that I think it will be better. I desire expressly that no marauding or violence be used toward the people, and that for rations or forage taken receipts be given, payable on proof of loyalty, and nothing be taken which is not needed.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

[PADUCAH, KY.,] September 8, 1863.

Major W. M. MABRY,

111th Illinois Infantry, Commanding Expedition:

MAJOR:Yours of the 7th instant received. I congratulate you upon your success thus far, and would advise you to move upon the force in the Obion Bottoms and use your best endeavor to drive them of, break up their rendezvous and camp. I think you had better mount one company of infantry, and more if necessary to accomplish the object. You had better move your whole command to Conyersville,

Tenn., so as to better act as a reserve force for your cavalry in case they are forced back. You will use your judgment in making your movements, reporting to these headquarters all changes in your locations, intentions, and the information gained.

Respectfully,

JAMES S. MARTIN,

Colonel 111th Illinois Infantry, Commanding Post.

MEMPHIS, TENN., September 8, 1863.

You will obey the orders of General Carr in regard to expedition.
