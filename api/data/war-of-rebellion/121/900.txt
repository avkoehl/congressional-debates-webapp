POST HOSPITAL, Fort Monroe, Va., April 18, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commadning District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be very much as on the last report. His appetite seems to be diminishing and he eats with less apparent relish. He complains, too, of muscular weakness. This may be attributable to the condition of the weather, which prevents him from taking outdoor exercise. State prisoner C. C. Clay is in good health.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,
