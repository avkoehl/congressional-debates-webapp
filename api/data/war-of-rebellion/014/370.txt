CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

Camp near Harrison's Landing, Va., August 11, 1862.

As the army is ordered to be in readiness for a movement at a moment's notice, and to be prepared to bivouac until a permanent depot is established, the general commanding directs that the allowance of tents to officers serving at these headquarters be reduced to one wall-tent for every two officers and one common tent for every two officers' servants. All tents in excess of this allowance, except such as may be actually necessary for office purposes, will be turned in to the assistant quartermaster at headquarters.

Officers will be expected to reduce their baggage, as far as practicable, and especially to take no large trunks or boxes, and they will see that this reduction is extended to their servants and to the enlisted men serving under their orders, some of whom have now more baggage than is allowed to commissioned officers. The surplus baggage should be plainly marked and turned over to the assistant quartermaster, who will have it stored on the transports.

These reductions must be made immediately on the receipt of the order to move. Captain Dandy will reassign the wagons as to conform more nearly to the diminished number of officers now serving at headquarters and the reductions above ordered.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

[S. WILLIAMS,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
