the extreme right of the Second Corps. Part of the army was moved more to the right. On the 17th, in the p. m., General Ewell moved Rodes' division forward from our left and found the enemy behind breast-works some distance in front; we fired one volley and fell back (see plate ---*). We recovered a portion of the line we lost on the 12th. The enemy attacked Gordon's brigade at 4 a. m. of the 18th with a heavy column, which was repulsed. In the p. m. of the 19th the corps made a movement to the front and right (the enemy having retired last night across the Ny) to attack the enemy's right. We attacked at 5 p. m. with Rodes' division and gained some success, but were finally forced to retire, the enemy being in full force (see plate ---*). A portion of the Third Corps moved out a short distance at the same time (see plate ---*).

A profound quiet prevailed on the 20th. On the morning of the 21st the Second Corps moved to the right of the army toward the Telegraph road, and south of the Po (see plate ---+), as the enemy was moving to the right, having abandoned the line of the Ny. The march was continued down the Po to the Telegraph road and then to Dickinson's Mill, where we encamped at 11 p. m. (see plate ---+). The enemy's advance attacked part of Pickett's division at Milford Station, and the cavalry skirmished with them all along the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad to that place. On the 22nd the march was continued to the vicinity of Hanover Junction, which we reached by 1 p. m., Rodes' division in the rear (see plate ---+). The cavalry fought the enemy's advance near Chesterfield Station (see plate ---+). On the 23rd the Second Corps was put in position in front and to the right of Hanover Junction (see plate ---#). The Third Corps was on the extreme left. The enemy crossed at Jericho Ford in the p. m., and drove the Third Corps away and formed a line at right angles to the railroad and across it toward New Found River (see plate ---#). The Second Corps was ordered to move up to support the Third after dark, but finally bivouacked along the railroad, across and to the left of the Telegraph road (see plate ---#). The enemy took the works near the Telegraph road bridge and crossed the North Anna. At night a line of defense was selected, and the First Corps moved to its line and fortified it; the Second Corps was held in reserve (see plate ---#). The Second Corps was placed on the right on the 24th, and fortified a line extending from the Telegraph road across the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad to the right of Hanover Junction (see plate ---#). The enemy fortified his position south of the North Anna. Some skirmishing occurred on the 24th and 25th. There was some skirmishing on the 26th, and the enemy advanced a line of battle on Rodes' division, on the right, which his skirmishers drove back (see plate ---#). On the morning of the 27th it was found that the enemy had withdrawn across the North Anna, and only a small force remained in front of the army. The Second Corps marched along the Virginia Central Railroad; then to Merry Oaks, and to Hughes' Cross-Roads (see plate ---$), the enemy moving to near Hanovertown. Marching at 3 a. m. of the 28th, via Atlee's Station and Shady Grove Church, the corps took position near Hundley's Corner, on the crest of the water-shed on the south bank of the Totopotomoy Creek (see plate ---$). There was a hardbought cavalry engagement near Aenon Church the same day. We
