CHAIRMAN OF THE MILITARY COMMITTEE.
Mr. BENTON. Mr. Speaker, in the list of
members of the Committee on Military Affairs as
made by the Chair, my name was placed at the
head of that committee. By the courtesy of the
committee, the first name upon the list is usually
considered chairman. The committee have the
right, however, to elect their own chairman.
While I am well pleased with a place upon that
committee, I feel it extremely inconvenient to
take upon myself the duties of its chairman at this
time. I therefore proposed to the committee that
we should go into the election and choose our own
chairman, for the purpose of relieving me from
the labors of that station; which they had the
right to do. It was done, and Mr. William H.
Bissell was elected chairman in my place.
The SPEAKER. Air. Bissell will be placed
at the head of that committee.
