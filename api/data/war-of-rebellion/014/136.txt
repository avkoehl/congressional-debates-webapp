Brigadier-General SEDGWICK:

General McClellan directs that you move to the vicinity of Yorktown to-morrow morning, with all your transportation, to be there at 9 o'clock if possible. Camp near the first parallel in front of it and there await further orders.

Give particular directions to your men not to leave camp; it is dangerous going about Yorktown until the torpedoes are removed.
