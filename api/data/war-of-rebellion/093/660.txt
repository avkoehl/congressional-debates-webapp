nessee River, and I hoped to have crossed at or near Gunter's Landing; but not having a sufficient force of cavalry with me, and learning that Major-General Forrest was not then in Middle Tennessee, our march was continued to Tuscumbia, Ala., that the supplies necessary to subsist the army till it should reach the rich portion of Tennessee might be obtained, and also to effect a junction with the cavalry under Major-General Forrest. We reached Tuscumbia on the 31st of October, and, for the reasons mentioned in my letter to you of December 11,* we were not able to commence the movement into Tennessee until the 21st of November. For a report of operations of the army from that time till the 11th of December, I respectfully refer to my letter of the latter date, a copy of which is inclosed.*

Our army took its position in front of Nashville on the 2nd of December, but the enemy still holding Murfreesborough with some 6,000 troops, Major-General Forrest, with the larger portion of the cavalry and Bate's division of infantry, was sent there to see if it was practicable to take the place. But after an examination and reconnaissance, during which, I am pained to say, our infantry behaved badly, Major-General Forrest reported that nothing could be done with the place by assault. Accordingly Bate's division was withdrawn, leaving General Forrest, with Jackson's and Buford's divisions of cavalry, in observation of the place, together with Mercer's and Palmer's infantry brigades, which were ordered there as Bate's division was withdrawn. I hoped thus to isolate the enemy's force at Murfreesborough and prevent them from foraging on the country or obtaining fuel, and if they should attempt to leave the place to have attacked them on their march.

Nothing of importance occurred till the morning of the 15th of December, when the enemy attacked simultaneously both our flanks. On our right he was handsomely repulsed, with heavy loss, but on our left he succeeded in driving in our flank, and toward evening carried some partially completed works which were in process of erection for the protection of this flank. Our line being necessarily very extended, a series of works had been commenced on each flank for their protection. During the night of the 15th our whole line was shortened and our left thrown back, and dispositions were made to meet any renewed attack. The corps of Major-General Cheatham was passed from our right to our left, leaving Lieutenant-General Lee on our right, who had been previously in the center, and placing Lieutenant-General Stewart's corps in the center, which had been previously the left.

Early on the 16th of December the enemy made a general attack on our lines, accompanied by a very heavy fire of artillery. All his assaults were repulsed with great loss till 3.30 p. m., when a portion of our line to the left of the center, occupied by Bate's division, suddenly gave way. In a few moments our entire line was broken, our troops retreating rapidly down the pike in the direction of Franklin, most of them, I regret to say, in great confusion, and all efforts to reform them were fruitless. Our loss in artillery was heavy, the giving way of the lines being so sudden that it was impossible to bring away the guns that had been placed in position. Our loss in killed and wounded was small. Our exact loss in prisoners I have not been able to ascertain, but do not think it great. I regret to say that among them were Major General Ed. Johnson and Brigadier Gens. H. R. Jackson and T. B. Smith. At Brentwood, some four miles from our line of battle, the troops were
