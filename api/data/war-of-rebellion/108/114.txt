miles nearer Alexandria; 12,000 to 15,000 Federal troops in and near Alexandria. Landing more from Washington by steamers. They had batteeries on Arlington Heightgs and junction Loudoun and Hampsjire Railroad. Federal troops not advanced from Alexandria, so far as I could reliably ascertain. Every train brings troops from Lynchburg to Manassas Junction. General Lee says, without arms, which he is unable to supply. Two of the injured Carolinians from collision are since dead, after amputation of limb.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES. Numbers 21. Richmond, Va., May 27, 1861.

I. Officers in command of troops traveling upon railroads or other public conveyances are required to enfroce strict discipline among their men. When the trainsor conveyances stop momentarily the men must be prevented from leaving their places, unless necessary, and from going to public bar rooms, where the limited time and their numbers are apt to produce difficulties with the proprietors and citizens. They will be strictly prohibited from riding on the platforms or tops of the cars.

II. To prevent accidents detrimental to the interest of the Stae, the telegraph operators on lines in Virginia are urged to give preference over all other business at their offices to messages concerning the movement of trains carrying troops or munitions of war.

By command of Major-General Lee:

NAVY-YARD,

Norfolk, Va., May 27, 1861.

General BEAUREGARD, C. S. Army, &amp;C.:

GENERAL: I start this day twelve 42-pounders and twelve 32-pounders (latter 61 tons weight). The 32-pounders will be furnished with carriages in eight days; the 42-pounders in twelve days. The pressure on the yard is excessive and I am doing my best to forward the guns, &c. This entire State (as well as North Carolina) is depending on this yard. You can fancy the difficulties that are in my way.

In great haste, respectfully and truly, yours,

J. N. MAFFITT,

Confederate States Navy.
