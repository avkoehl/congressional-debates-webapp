Can it be possible that they have turned on us now, thinking that Rossecrans is too strong for them? The withdrawal of the pickets from the river seems to indicate this movement.

Nothing is known yet of the fight at Philadelphia, except heavy cannonading all the afternoon.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

EMERY S. BOND,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

MUNFORDVILLE,

October 20, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE:

Dispatch from Lebanon reports 600 rebels on Greensburg road, moving in direction of railroad near Lebanon. I am not apprised of Federal strength at Glasgow. My cavalry are all at Glasgow; have about 300. Has Colonel Weatherford been mounted?

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel S. A. STRICKLAND,

Glasgow:

Make requisition for the number of wagons you want. Captain Huntington will fill it. Send over the transportation he furnished you. The wagons can return with commissary stores after your quartermaster settles with him for them. Captain Stone left Columbia this morning. If you can by any means furnish mounted men to pursue rebels, do so. It would be well to send information to Captain Stone and let him get on track of rebels with his forces.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-general.

MUNFORDVILLE,

October 20, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville:

Fifty rebels passed between Glasgow and Columbia to-day, going north. I have instructed all the available mounted force of my command. It would be well to direct Colonel Weatherford to send 50 mounted men from Lebanon, via Greensburg, and get on their track. This should be done immediately.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
