COLONEL: I inclose a telegram received from General Curtis in regard to a block-house and additional troops at Humboldt. You will carry out his views by removing all but one company from Pleasant Grove to Humboldt, and if you think it advisable remove Captain Kendall's company, Sixteenth Kansas Volunteers, there also, and take measures to complete the block-house as soon as possible.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,Commanding Department:

The enemy has not moved back this way yet. My commands are still after them. Captain Anderson had a skirmishing fight on the 8th above Maysville. He had 2 men wounded, 1 badly. Killed 6 of the enemy. Refugees are coming in from Northwestern Texas. Nearly all the Texas Rangers have started in. Rivers here falling. In reference to the purchase of ponies, but very few good ones can be got here. I would want about 1,000 stout, first-class ponies, about 14 hands high, and to bear close inspection. The Osages have many, and there are many in Kansas. I should have them at the earliest possible moment. There is grass. Could you buy them? I could send up to Kansas for them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. A. PHILLIPS,

Colonel, Commanding.
