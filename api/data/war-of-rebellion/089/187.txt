General BUTLER:

If General Weitzel moves but one brigade from his own line, it should occupy the ground now held by Birney. If he moves another brigade I would like to have it at the right of the old entrenchments ready to move out.

Sent for information of Major-General Weitzel. Can you do both?*

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, October 12, 1864-2.30 p.m. (Received 2.40 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

I have arranged with General Kautz to move out and cover the right of the movement occupying the ground between the Darbytown and Charles City road, and trying to find the enemy's left. I shall move Ames' division out till its right rests on or just beyond the Darbytown road, and then move up parallel with the road. Birney I intend to put in at about Kell's house to try to turn the enemy's left. Ames' division, reduced by his details, pickets, and the One hundred and ninety-ninth Pennsylvania and the One hundredth New York at Deep Bottom, will be about 3,100 strong. Birney's, reduced by his pickets and the absence of his strongest regiment at Deep Bottom, will be about 1,600 strong. I shall, therefore, need very much one of Weitzel's brigades to go with me. I take three batteries.
