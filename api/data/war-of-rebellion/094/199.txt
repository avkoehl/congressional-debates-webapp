December 15, 1864-2.10 p. m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding:

I have been unable to discover any movements of the enemy since about 10 o'clock, when he moved what appeared 2,000 troops in rear of his line to our right. I pressed his right strongly, getting possession of the works constructed by my troops. I found him in strong force, with artillery in position. I retired my left, but still hold the works in my front on the right of the railroad. Hope all will go well.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

STEEDMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

Major-General THOMAS:

That part of my command used against the enemy to-day now occupy the works on right of railroad, made by my command, and nearly all the works on the left of railroad, except one square fort built by enemy, which I completely command by occupying the building of Mr. Rains, which is loophole. My advance posts report considerable force assembled on my front to-night. My loss in nearly 250.

J. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

GENERAL THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

Major-General STEEDMAN.

Yours received. Keep a good lookout for the enemy in the moving Position at dark: Two divisions Fourth Army Corps, Twenty-third Army Corps, General A. J. Smith's troops, and Hatch's cavalry to left rear and rear of enemy, from Granny White pike to Brentwood range of hills. We hold rebel main line; have captured a thousand prisoners, 16 pieces of artillery, 14 wagons, Chalmer's headquarters train.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.

DECEMBER 15, 1864.

Major S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy seem to be massing a force about three-quarters of a mile on my right in the woods. They can be enfiladed by the guns of Fort Negley. I think a strong skirmish line should be kept on the right and left of the Nolensville pike to watch their movements.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
