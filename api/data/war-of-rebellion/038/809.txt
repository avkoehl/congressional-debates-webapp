Major R. W. MEMMINGER:

General Bowen still holds his position, but thinks he will have to retire to this side of Bayou Pierre under cover of night. I urge him not to do so unless indispensable to his safety. Have full confidence in his judgment. A large amount of bacon which was in Port Gibson has been removed to Grand Gulf. No further demonstration from force of enemy on Chickasaw Bayou. Show this dispatch to Governor Pettus.
