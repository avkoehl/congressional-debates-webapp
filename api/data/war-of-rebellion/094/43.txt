NASHVILLE, December 4, 1864-10 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Last night the enemy planted a battery on the river at Bell's Landing and succeeded in capturing two boats on their way down. As soon as it was reported, at my request, Commander Fitch, U. S. Navy, went down with an iron-clad and two or three gun-boats and soon drove the battery away, recapturing the tow steamers. He will make a reconnaissance in force down the river to-morrow. The enemy remains in the same position to-day as yesterday. I have also hear from Tullahoma, via Knoxville, to-day; the railroad is uninjured that far, and no sings of the enemy in that neighborhood; I have headed no firing in the direction of Murfreesborough, and therefor infer that the enemy has made no move in that direction yet, but is now turning his attention to crossing the river below; for any such attempt I am prepared to meet.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 4, 1864.

Byt. Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND:

Major-General Schofield informs me that Major-General Stoneman has, by order of the Secretary of War, been relieved from duty in the Department of the Ohio. I respectfully request that the order may be countermanded, as General Schofield has no other general officer to whom he can instruct the affairs of East Tennessee with as much safety as General Stoneman.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
