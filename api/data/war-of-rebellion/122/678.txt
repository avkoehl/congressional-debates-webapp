those duties in a very satisfactory manner. Upon them have been thrown all the heaviest disbursements; and these, so far as is known to this office, have been made faithfully, and on their parts with integrity.

In closing this report it becomes my duty to allude to the loss the corps has sustained in the death of its distinguished chief, Bvt. Major General George Gibson. The founder of the corps, he wielded the affairs of the department for more than forty years with integrity and ability, and by his amiable manners and kindly heart won for it great popularity in the Are confidence of the country. That it may ever deserve that confidence is my earnest wish.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. P. TAYLOR,

Commissary-General of Subsistence.
