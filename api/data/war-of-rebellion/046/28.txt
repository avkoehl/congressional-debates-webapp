15 to 20 feet square, is by no means commensurate with the expenditure of ammunition, involved.

[146.] The section, Place V,* is taken along the line where this two days' firing upon the bomb-proof produced the greatest effect; in other words, along the axis of the breach produced.

The total quantity of sand removed to such a distance that it no longer afforded the bomb-proof shelter any protection against the projectiles from the breaching guns, is estimated, from a close personal examination, at 165 cubic yards. It requires, as will be seen from the above tables, 54 1/2 gross tons of metal to effect it.

147. Meanwhile, at the request of Admiral Dahlgren, three days' firing, commencing August 30, from a portion of our breaching guns, had been expended on Fort Sumter, and it was known that all the barbette guns of that work had been dismounted. Deserters and prisoners reported that but one caseate gun remained serviceable, and that was located on the northwest face, near its junction with the gorge, and consequently looked up the harbor.

148. Early on the morning of September 7, Rear-Admiral Dahlgren sent a flag of truce to Fort Sumter, demanding its surrender, notifying me, at the same time, by signals, that if the summons was not complied with, he should "move up with all the iron-clads and engage it." The demand was refused.

149. During the night of the 8th of September a naval force attempted to carry Sumter by assault, and was repulsed with considerable loss. Before I was informed by the admiral of his intentions to storm the work, I had made arrangements to do the same thing, but the force assembled for that purpose was detained by low tide at its rendezvous in the creek west of Morris Island, until after the naval attack had failed. The project was then abandoned.

The only arrangements for concert of action between the two parties that were finally made, were intended simply to prevent accident or collision between them. Each party was deemed in itself sufficiently strong for the object in view.

150. The capture of all of Morris Island and the demolition of Fort Sumter completed those portions of the plan of joint operations against the defenses of Charleston in which the land forces were to take the lead.
