[CHAP. XXII.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Fort Henry, March 14, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

After your letter inclosing copy of anonymous letter, upon which severe censure was based, I felt as though it would be impossible for me to serve longer without a court of inquiry. Your telegram of yesterday, however, places such a different phase upon my position that I will again assume command, and give every effort to the success of our cause. Under the worst circumstances I would do the same.

I have just received the first word from General Smith since he left. The troops were debarked at Savannah; why I do not know. There are eight regiments here awaiting transportation yet. I had expected the return of transports from above to take them before this.

The supply of commissary stores sent forward is abundant, but of forage rather short. Under my directions Captain Baxter, assistant quartermaster, is using every effort to keep up the supply.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

P. S.-Since writing the above yours of the 9th instant is received. I certainly received but one telegraphic dispatch up to the 28th of February to furnish report of my strength. I had done my best, however, previous to that to get in field returns, in order that consolidated returns might be made out to send you. Now I am not in communication with General Smith's command to report fully as I should like to do, but all that I can learn directly or indirectly you shall be made acquainted with. I feel a doubt about when I should proceed up the river. General Smith's landing at Savannah indicates that fortifications have been encountered above that point and the enemy in force.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

FORT HENRY, March 14, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The garrison at Clarksville has been entirely broken up and fort dismantled. Two small regiments, numbering less than 700 effective men in the aggregate, are left at Donelson. Forts Henry and Heiman are garrisoned-Fifty-second Indiana and Curtis' Horse.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Fort Henry, March 14, 1862.

Colonel OGLESBY,

Commanding First Brigade, First Division:

You will immediately embark your command on board the steamer Henry Choteau, ordered to report to you at Metal Landing. See that as many are put on board as she can carry, having regard for health, and, when embarked, proceed up the Tennessee until you overtake the expedition commanded by Major General C. F. Smith, to whom you will report.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNumbers A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
