On reducing the pay of the Navy—Mr. Meriwether.
H. of Reps.
at the last session, against the increase of thenajy,
and in favor of its reduction, the Secretary passes
all unheeded, and moves on in his bold career of
folly and extravagance, without abiding for a mo-
ment any will but his own. Nothing more can be
hoped for, so long as the navy has such a host of
backers, urging its increase and extravagance—
from motives of personal interest too often. The
axe should be laid at once to the root of the evil:
cut down the pay, and it will not then be sought
after so much as a convenient resort for idlers,
who seels the offices for the pay, expecting and in-
tending thai but little service shall be rendered in
return, because but very little is needed. The
salaries are far beyond any compensation paid to
any other officer of Government, either State or
Federal, for corresponding services. A lieutenant
receives higher pay than a veiy large majority of
the judges of the highest judicatories known to the
States; a commander far surpasses ihem, and equals
the salaries of a majority of the Governors ot the
States. Remove the temptation which high pay
and no labor present, and you will obviate the evil.
Put down the salaries to where they were before
the act of 1835, and you will have no greater
effort after its offices than you had before. So
long as the salaries are higher than similar
talents can command in civil life, so long will
applicants flock to the navy for admission, and
tne constant tendency will be to increase its ex-
penses. The policy of our Government is to keep
a very small army and navy during lime of peace,
to insure light taxes, and to induce the preponder-
ance of the civil over the military authorities. In
time of peace, we shall meet with no difficulty in
sustaining an efficient navy, as we always have
done. In time of war, patriotism will call forth
our people to the service. Those who would not
heed this call are not wanted; for those who fight
for pay will, under all circumstances, fight for those
who will pay the best. The navy cannot complain
of this proposed reduction; for ihpay was increased
in view of the increasing value of labor and prop-
erty throughout the whole country. No other pay
was increased; and why should not this be re-
duced"!—not the whole amount actually increased,
but only a small portion of the increase"! Tt is due
to the country; and no one should object. We
are now supporting the Government on borrowed
money. The revenues will not be sufficient to sup-
port it hereafter; and reduction has to take place
sooner or later, and upon some one or all of the de-
partments. Upo* which ought it to fall more prop-
erly than on that which has been defended against
the prejudices resulting from the high priceswhich
have recently fallen upon every department of la-
bor and property'!
By the adoption of the amendment proposed,
there will be a permanent annual saving of about
®400,000 in the single item of pay. And, from the
embarrassed condition of the treasury, so large a
sum of money might, with the greatest propriety,
be saved; more especially sincc, by the late British
treaty concluded at iliis place, an annual increase
is to be made to the navy expenditures of some
$600,000, as it is staled, to keep a" useless squadron
on the coast of Africa. The estimates for pay for
the present year greatly excecd those of the last
year. We appropriated for the last year's service
for pay, &c., $-2,335,000. The sum asked for the
same service this year is 953,13!). Besides, there
there is the sum ot 8380,000 asked for clothing—a
new appropriation, never asked for before. The
clothing for seamen being paid for by themselves,
so mucli of the item of pay as was necessary had
hitherto been expended m clothing for them, which
was received by them in lieu of money. Now, a
separate fund is asked, which is to be used as pay,
and will increase that item so much, making a sum-
total of 83,333,139; which is an excess of $998,139
over and above that appropriated for the like pur-
pose last session.
It seems not to be necessary absolutely to make
this increased appropiiation. The Secretary of
the Navy says that his plan of keeping the ships
sailing over the ocean (where possibly no vessel
can or will see them, and where the people with
whom we trade can never learn anything of our
greatness, on account of the absence of our ships
from their ports, being kept constantly sailing from
station to station) will "require larger squadrons
than we have heretofore employed." He then
states that his estimates are prepared for squad-
rons upon this large and expensive plan. "This,"
he says, "it is my duty to do, submitting to Con-
9
gress to determine whether, under the circumstan-
ces, so large a force can properly be put in com-
mission or not. If the condition of the treasury
will warrant it, (of which they are the judges,) I
have no hesitation in recommending the largest
force estimated for." It is well known that the con-
dition of the treasury will not warrant this force.
We must fall back upon the force of last year, as
the ultimatum that can be sustained. Our appro-
priations for pay last year were $1,000,000 less
than those now asked for. This can be cut off
without prejudice to the service; and with the re-
duction proposed in the salaries, SI,400,000 can be
saved from waste, and applied to sustain a depleted
treasury. Increase is now unreasonable and im-
practicable.
A portion of the home squadron, authorized in
September, 1841, has not yet gone to sea, for the
want of seamen. While our commerce is failing,
and our sailors are idle, they will not enter the
service. The flag-ship of that squadron is yet in
port without her complement of men. Why, then,
only increase officers and build ships, when you
cannot get men to man them"?
Note.—The following is the law fixing the pay
of the navy. Gordon's Digest, page 67C:
The pay of captains, commanding ships of 32
guns and upwards, shall be $100 per month, and
eight rations per day; of captains, commanding
ships of 20 ana under 32guns, $75 per month, and
six rations per day; of a master-commandant, $60
per month and five rations per day; and of lieuten-
ants, who may command the smaller vessels, $50
per month and four rations per day.
Whenever any officer as aforesaid shall be em-
ployed in the command of a squadron on separate
service, the allowance of rations to such command-
ing officer shall be doubled during the continuance
of such command, and no longer, except in the case
of the commanding officer of the navy, whose allow-
ance while in service shall always be at the rate of
sixteen rations per day.
The pay and subsistence of the respective com-
mission and warrant officers shall be as follows;
A lieutenant less than a master-commandant, or
lieutenant commanding a small vessel, $40 per
month, and three rations per day; a chaplain, $40
per month and two rations per day; a sailing-mas-
ter, $40 per month and two rations per day; a
surgeon, $50per month and two rations per day, &c.

The chief of the Medical Bureau, in his an-
nual report, presents the following facts, as illus-
trative of the manner in which some of the ap-
propriations made for the naval service are dis-
posed of; and what fidelity characterizes the ex-
penditures! Speaking of the expenditure of the
appropriation for medicines, he says:
"Six hundred and sixty-five dollars and fifty-seven cen's
were, unauihorizedly, paid out of the appropriaiion for medi-
cities, surgical instruments, for 31 blue cloth frock-coa's.
with navy buttons, and a silver star on them; 31 pairs .of
blue cassimpre pantaloons, and 31 blue cassimere res s.
with navy buttons;—and all this toggery for 'Jack'—for
pensioners who never had worn anything longer than
a sailor's jacket, or, at most, in storms, a monkey or pea-
jacket, the cost of which is eight dollars, instead of foui'tee^
