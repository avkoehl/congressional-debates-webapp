General Wilson telegraphs that his command is suffering for forage, and asks that hay be sent to Augusta; says he has 20,000 animals and 17,000 men to feed. I have no means of communicating with General Gillmore.

Major-General WILSON, Macon, Ga.:

Look out for Extra Billy Smith, rebel Governor of Virginia. A reward of $25,000 is offered by the Secretary of War for his capture.* I judge from your dispatch that you have a good chance to catch Jeff. Davis.

Major General C. GROVER:

General Wilson wants his supplies sent to Macon by way of Augusta. You will therefore retain the steamer Governor Troup on the Savannah River for that purpose. Lieutenant Woodruff, of General Wilson's staff, can carry a load of supplies by way of the Altamaha, if he thinks best.
