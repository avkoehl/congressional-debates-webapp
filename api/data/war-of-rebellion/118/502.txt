necessary in anticipation of the arrival of large numbers of prisoners. I believe a force pump and hose have been ordered for use at the fort, which will serve to transfer the water from the water boat to such place as it may be required. The present buildings have their floor on the ground, which being always very damp makes them uncomfortable and unhealthy. The height of the building is such that the floor may be raised fifteen or eighteen inches from the ground and leave still sufficient from the floor to the eaves to admit of three tiers of bunks, about nine feet. The Quartermaster - General approves of this modification.

Square ventilators some fifteen of twenty feet apart set into the comb of the roof with shutters on the four sides are suggested as more convenient.

Major JAMES H. STEGER, Assistant Adjutant - General.

SIR: A few days since two of my best soldiers were captured by a gang of guerrillas and taken ten or twelve miles from here to the camp of one Colonel Harrison (formerly lieutenant - colonel of MacDonald's regiment, now its colonel), from whom I received a note in some mysterious way stating that he had my men and would hold them until
