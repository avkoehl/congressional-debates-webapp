SAINT JOSEPH, MO., June 15, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

My dispatch of of yesterday in reference to H. t. was sent you several hours previous to the reception of yours on the same unhappy theme. You have misconstructed my telegram as answer to yours. I did not send him to Saint Louis, but have him in prison. I have ordered the arrest of his confederates in crime, and shall put the whole party through rapidly and thoroughly. I stopped him in his mad career as soon as he could be found after the receipt of General Rosecran's telegram of 8th instant. You will remember, colonel, that he was ordered out on his last campaign directly from department headquarters, of which I was not advised until I heard of his operations in the field. I had respectfully and earnestly protested against his continued presence in my district, but H. T's importunities prevailed.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

If half the reports of Truman's and Gilstrap's operations are true they ought to be shot. You must take these matters up thoroughly and assure law-abiding people, as you have always done, that the rights of a all will be respected and defended. What we ask of the citizens is a faithful performance on duty and co-operation in the task of protection to the rights of all.

I have seen Poindexter, of Randolph, who is under bonds, and written him a note to use his influence in favor law and order among the rebel sympathizers. Keep the secret and give needful orders to secure him from molestation or outrage. He will do good.
