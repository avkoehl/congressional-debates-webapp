to me from that place, as it will save time. Middlebrook, Darnestown, and Seneca Bridge, on the road from Brookville to Clarksburg, must be my position until driven in or re-enforced. Let Buford's brigade be sent to Seneca Bridge. These dispositions will completely cover the front, until the general can complete his arrangements. I have two regiments at Darnestown, and shall send a section of artillery there.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Report from picket states the enemy to be advancing in considerable force from Poolesville to Seneca Mill. This indicates a movement on this road to try, possibly, to turn my left. If this report is corroborated I shall take up a position a mile farther back, to cover the road coming from the river at that point. I have a regiment, First New York Cavalry, at Middlebrook, and a squadron of First Cavalry at Seneca Bridge, leading out from Mechanicsville.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Just heard form the squadron of the First Cavalry at Mechanicsville. Is picketing at Unity and Cracklinton, with pickets on the road to Seneca Bridge. No enemy there. Unity is on the main road to Damascus, and also to Cooksville, on the frederick and Baltimore turnpike. As soon as that regiment arrives at Mechanicsville, my orders are there for it to be established in the above-mentioned places. Some firing was heard on the Rockville and Frederick road this evening. I think the enemy was shelling my pickets near clarksburg. Have not yet heard from them.
