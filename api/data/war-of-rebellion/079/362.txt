Colonel TOURTELLOTTE,

Allatoona:

It is reported that there is at Canton one brigade of rebel inquiry, consisting of four regiment. I will try to ascertain the truth of it; in the [mean time] if you have any one you can send out do so. It may be that they intend to capture forage parties.

HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Rome, Ga., October 19, 1864.

[General W. T. SHERMAN:]

GENERAL: A cavalry force attacked Vining's Station, cut the wires, and, it is presumed, destroyed a part of the road, as we have no communication south of Marietta. A small force cut the wires near Big Shanty, but they have since been repaired. Another cavalry force fired into the construction train between Adairsville and Calhoun, killing and wounding a few. And still another force attacked train of Twenty-THIRD Army Corps near Cartersville, with what result I have not heard. Kilpatrick reports Armstrong, Ferguson, Gholson, and Ross, and Cedartown yesterday. Hood's whereabouts we know nothing of here. Supplies are being received for your command. Trains have discontinued running south of Allatoona. I have everything busy here, and am getting on well. Please send by bearer any news or orders you may wish executed.

Very respectfully,

JNO M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
