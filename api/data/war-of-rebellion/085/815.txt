JEFFERSON CITY, October 12, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS:

I have arrived at this point. My command will camp to-night on the Moreau, four miles from town. I will push forward one brigade at least to-night on the railroad west and follow to-morrow with the remainder. I regret Mower has left, but hope his division will soon arrive. When may I expect it? We want rations; would it not be well to send them to Washington by rail, and have boats bring them from that point to this?
