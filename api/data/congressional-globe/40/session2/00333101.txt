THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. SCHENCK. I object to that. I am
â– willing that it should be made the special order
after the tax bill has been acted upon in com-
mittee.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The gen-
tleman can move on'Moriday next to suspend
the rules for the purpose of making this bill a
special order.
The SPEAKER. There is one motion to
suspend the rules now pending, submitted by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Eliot,]
which will come up on Monday next the first
thing after the morning hour.
Mr. BUTLER. I give notice that on Mon-
day next 1 will move to suspend the rules, in
order that this bill may be then considered.
ORDER 01? BUSINESS.
_ Mr. SCHENCK. It is now after three
o'clock. I ask unanimous consent that the
morning hour for to-day may be dispensed
with.
Mr. BEN.TAMTN and others objected.
Mr. SCHENCK. Cannotthe morning hour
be dispensed with by a majority voteV
The SPEAKER. That requires unanimous
consent. The private business may be set
aside by a majority vote ; but should that be
done, then the oider would be the call of com-
mittees for reports of a public nature.
ORDER 1'OR AN EVENING SESSION.
Mr. SCIIENCK. As the morning hour
must go on, we can hardly gel into Committee
of the Whole on the tax bill before half past
four o'clock. I will therefoie move that there
be an evening session this evening at i.alf past
seven o'clock, for the consideration of the
internal tax bill in Committee of the Whole.
Mr RANDALL. Is it to bo with the under-
standing that no business is to be transacted
this evening except the consideration of the
tax bill in Committee of the Whole?
The SPEAKER. That would require unani-
mous consent.
Mr. RANDALL. I must object to an even-
ing session, unless such an arrangement can
be made.
The SPEAKER. The motion is that the
House shall meet at half past seven o'clock
this evening in Committee of the Whole for
the consideration of the tax bill. Such an
order can be made by a majority vote. There
probably will be no other business transacted,
as there is usually no quorum present at an
evening session when the House comes out of
Committee of the Whole. And any member
can then call for a division upon any question,
and if no quorum is present no business can
be done.
The motion of Mr. Sciibxck for an evening
session was then agreed to.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
The SPEAKER. The morning hour ha?
now commenced. This being private bill day,
the first business in order is the call ot com-
mittees for reports of a private nature, com-
mencing with the Committee on Invalid Pen-
