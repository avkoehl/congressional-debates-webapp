Major General FITZ LEE:

General Longstreet wishes you to re-enforce the force at Doggett's with all of Gary's mounted men and your own, if necessary, to develop the enemy's strength. If they are coming by that road he wishes [you] to go down and fight them below Seven Pines.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General FITZ LEE,

Commanding Cavalry, North Side:

General Longstreet thinks you had better send more force to Doggett's-enough to hold the crossing against any force. Keep your scouts well out below so as to prevent any force from surprising the force there by getting in their rear.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
