THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 25,
of other countries, would be in the way of ser-
vility rather than civility, and ought not to be
approved.
The gentleman from New York [Mr-Piitmsr]
has suggested that the Secretary of State should
prescribe a uniform. Sir, that is the very idea
that those who support this resolution are com-
bating. We do not want these Court costumes;
they do not belong to our Government; they
are not required by any consideration of neces-
sity, expediency, or propriety; they do not be-
long to our people; they are not accustomed to
them, and therefore they should not be obliged
to adopt them.
Mr. SCHENCK. When our ministers abroad
are engaged in the transaction of business they
dress as the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr. Banks] is now dressed. It is only upon
occasions of ceremony that a different dress is
required.
Mr. BANKS. The. representation of this
country upon occasions ot ceremony is essen-
tially and exclusively a matter of business. It
is upon such occasion^ that we ought to be rep-
resented as we are, and not as we are not. The
representatives of other Governments on such
occasions wear the costumes of the countries
by which they are accredited, and to which the
higher class of people are accustomed. They
arc thus truly representatives of their respec-
tive nations. That is exactly what we should
demand of our representatives. They should
represent Americans according to the customs
of their country. lie will thus do for his own
country what other diplomatic agents do for
theirs. Diplomacy is not merely an affair of
compliment or courtesy, but of substantial and
serious business; and in the discharge of his
duties ho should appear as an American, and
an American only, and in that costume to
which an American is accustomed, which his
countrymen would appreciate, in which he
would appear if summoned before the repre-
sentatives of the people, the Supreme Court
or the Chief Executive Magistrate of the na-
tion.
It has been suggested that the adoption of
the customary Court costumes is necessary,
because to sot them aside would make men
appear singular. Let me suppose a case: sup-
pose the'late President of the United States
before he was elected to the high office in which
ho surrendered his life had been sent as a rep-
resentative of this Government to the Court of
St. James or any other foreign Court. As ho
came to us from the great West he was essen-
tially and truly an American citizen, an Amer-
ican representative. Where is the man who for
asiugiomouient would have recommended that,
in order to avoid the singiilarappearancc which
lie would have presented in the customary cos-
tume of his whole life, and which was as natural
to him as his movements or lus person, he
should have been put into Court costume not
his own, and exhibited himself, for the first
tune in his life, in a bag wig, cocked hat,, knee-
breeches, silk stockings, and a sword at his
side, with whatever else the custom of the
larger or lesser Courts of Europe might require?
In which garb would the world have best seen
the natural man ? In which would he to us have
seemed most singular? Who of those he repre-
sented would have preferred to see him in this
plight, in trumpery which he had never worn,
which did not belong to him, which was never
recognized fay his Government, and which would
make him appear to be anything else than what
he was, or in that simple manly American dress
which he has made his own as it was that of
his country, and in which his form is to be trans-
mitted to after ages? In which would he have
been most at home? In which would he have
been least singular? There cannot be a doubt
that in the eyes of his countrymen, in the eyes
of those who rightly appreciate the country he
represented, it would be in that alone in which
we knew him and loved him.
_ There have been many men at. these recep-
tions at foreign courts who in this respect have
boon •' singular." Napoleon wore always the
uniform of the consular guard, Abd-el-fcader
wore the dress of his country. Suppose that
any man at any of'those courts had mistaken
Abd-el-Kader or Napoleon for a common man,
of what account would that have been to them
or the Governments they represented? . And
suppose that an American representing this
country at the court of England or France or
Austria should wear the dress in which he ap-
pears before the President or in Congress or
the Supreme Court and should be mistaken
by some chamberlain or subordinate officer for
a man of no account. We may say that by
and by, when accustomed to their costumes
and acquainted with their history, and com-
prehending their future, they will know and
understand American citizens better. They
will not long nor often mistake them for ser-
vants, either of courts or of Governments not
their own.
An American representative in the dress of
an American citizen, at any of the Courts of
Europe, represents this Government in mat-
ters of business. He stands in the costume
of his country as of his time, as Franklin did
of his country and of his time ; and any man
who mistakes him for a servant of anybody
deludes himself and does us no damage. Tur-
got said, in France, in 1749, when inaugurated
in an ecclesiastical office in France, at the age
of twenty-two, that the day was near when
the American States would achieve their inde-
pendence of England and play before the
world the great role which Carthage played
in ancient history. If any man at any of the
European Courts should ask, who is it that
amid the throng of gilded courtiers appears
in a simple suit of black, even with the white
cravat, which so much alarms us? the answer
is: that it is an American, representing a coun-
try which at a day not distant, with nobler
purposes and a happier destiny, will play before
the world the game which Carthage played in
earlier ages.
I do not doubt that a dress distinctively
American will cause some comments in the
Courts of Europe. I do not doubt, sir, what
has been so clearly stated by the gentleman from
Ohio, that there are officers of other Govern-
ments who will smile at an American repre-
sentative clad simply as an American citizen ;
and there maybe men who will wilt under such
rigorous treatment, and perhaps seek to with-
draw not only from the circle of ceremony, but
even from the service of the Government. But
such men are not fit to be representatives of
this country anywhere, either abroad or at
home, now or at any time, in any costume either
of courtiers or civilians. Mr. Speaker, it has
been the custom in Europe for many years to
deride America and things American. The
rulers of Europe sneered at Washington ; they
Sneered at the Provincial Congress; they
sneered at the Declaration of Independence;
they sneered at our form of Government;
they predicted its failure; they rejoiced at the
rebellion against its authority as the expected
indication of its overthrow. They sneered again
at the armies which we called into the service
of the country and at that glorious man who
represented the head of the Government dur-
ing the great struggle. This was the constant
manifestation of Europe ; but we have outlived
their derision. Every day we have grown
stronger and stronger ; and the day will soon
come when we shall establish not only an
American policy in the matter of dress at for-
eign Courts, but in all that appertains to the
government of the great nations of the earth,
giving Europe or Asia as much cause to com-
plain of our ideas of continental administration
and international-law as it is now thought they
may have in regard to the change of diplomatic
dress proposed by the Senate.
The time will come when they will not sneer
at us, and when any chamberlain or any other
officer of any foreign Government or of any
crowned head of Europe, seeing any represent-
ative of this country at his receptions dressed
as an American gentleman should be dressed,
bearing himself as an American gentleman :|
should bear himself, will point out that man, II
not as one discredited by the simplicity of his
costume, but as one distinguished and honor-
able among the first representatives of the
greatest nations; one who will speak hereafter
for fifty or a hundred million people controlling
the Atlantic ocean and the route to Europe on
the one hand and the Pacific and the route to
Asia on the other, occupying the continents
between these two great seas, giving law to one
hemisphere^ but guiding the interests of both;
a people to whom God gave liberty and the
sense to preserve it. That will be the char-
acter borne by the man who truly represents
the nation when it shall have fulfilled its des-
tiny, and though bearing no insignia of rank,
no title of nobility, wearing only that dress
which every 'American wears in church, before
the judicial tribunals, or in the presence of the
ruler of his country.
I now demand the previous question.
Mr. SCHENCK. Does it not prohibit the
wearing of any uniform? Does it not repeal
the act of July, 1866, this being of a later
date?
Mr. BANKS. I do not understand that it
repeals that act. If there be a doubt on the
question I am willing to agree to an amend-
ment. I am aware there is an interpre-
tation which would preclude the wearing of
uniforms by officers of the Army and Navy
under the act of 1866, butl do not so construe
it. If I thought such would be the interpre-
tation I would myself move an amendment.
Mr. LOGAN. My own impression is, with-
out mentioning names, that this resolution has
been introduced to prevent gentlemen wearing
military uniforms who are not entitled to do
so. I understand persons at foreign Courts
have been in the habit of procuring military
commissions from the Governors of States and
then putting on military uniforms and wearing
them as a Court dress. I think the Senate res-
olution is a proper one, and that it will here-
after cut off anything of the kind.
Mr. BANKS. No one will be allowed to
wear a uniform unless he is entitled to wear it
under act of Congress.
Mr. NICHOLSON. I hope the gentleman
will let me offer the following proviso :
Provided, That this prohibition shall not apply to
our consuls in the Jiarbary States.
Mr. BANKS. J cannot yield for that pur-
pose. I demand the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the joint resolution was ordered
to a third reading ; and it was accordingly read
the third time.
Mr, BANKS demanded the previous ques-
tion on the passage of the joint resolution.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the joint resolution was passed.
Mr. BANKS moved to reconsider the vote
by which the joint resolution was passed ; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
LONG ISLAND, BOSTON IIARBOK.
The next business on^the Speaker's table
was Senate bill No. 63, to authorize the entry
and occupation of a portion of Long Island,
in Boston harbor, for military purposes ; which
was read a first and second time.
The bill authorizes the Secretary of War to
take possession of that portion of Long Island,
in Boston harbor, Massachusetts,. belonging to
James T. Austin, for the purpose of erecting a
fort and such other structures as may be needed
for military purposes, an.d to pay for the same
§5,000, as agreed upon; provided that this sum
shall not be paid until the Attorney General of
the United States is satisfied that the title has
been fully transferred to the United States free
from all incumbrances, and that the person
receiving the money is competent to act in the
premises.
' Mr. ROSS. I make the point of order that
this bill makes an appropriation, and must,
therefore, under the rules, have its first con-
