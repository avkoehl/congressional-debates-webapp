Maine Boundary Question—'Mr. Menefee.
Ho. ot? Reps.
and concurrent jurisdiction of the British Prov-
ince ' I say, sir, that if she be true to herself,
if she be true to her own fame, if she regard the
oath she has taken in the face of the world m
appealing to arms against such a retreat or sub-
mission, she will not do it No! I do most sol-
emnly believe that any arrangement for this, con- ¡
summated by the President of the United States,
or any other Power, will be a virtual abandon-
ment of the rights and honor of Maine. If
Maine submits to it, what may not the country
expect her submission to > Hei sister Republics
will pronounce her capable of being duven into
any teims which the Federal Executive may de-
mand her assent to. This bill, I trust, aims at
no such humiliation for her If the exclusive
jurisdiction of Maine to the Aroostook country
be in any -way disturbed or invaded by the pro-
vincial government or by Great Britain, then will
the contingency contemplated by this bill have
occurred. Upon any other construction of the
bill, or of the duty which the Federal Executive
•will owe to Maine under it, I would soonei see
the bill defeated than passed
Sir, allusions have been made on this floor to the
conduct of the local authouties of Maine, and in
a quaiter wheie it should have been said last, if
atall,howevei just the sentiment may berc¿atdcd
by this committee or the countiy The late pio-
ceedings of the Governor and Legislatuie of
Maine have been pronounced rash, unfortunate,
and precipitate, that Maine has been plunged
needlessly into difficulty, and the peace of the
nation put in jeopaidy.
Sir, if I would make an issue upon such impu-
tations, at this period, or if it was the duty of
Maine to fall down at the footstool of the Federal
Government to apologise foi any pioceeding of
rashness or precipitancy on her part, she might
well turn and piove herself tho accuser of the
Federal Government, and, fiom its íecords, prove
upon it negligence in the extreme towards the
rights and honor of Maine If Maine has been
rash, this Government has been still more culpa-
bly negligent If fault there bo anywhere, the
first fault attaches not to tho authoi itiea of Maine
If blame is to be traced to its souree and orip-in,
it will not be found icsting with, or proceeding
fiom, Maine Imakonoaciusationothci than to
say, as I have said bííoie, that Mamt lias been for
ytm 9 neglected in In r boundary, and hcrtioubhs
and hcrdangcis have been foiccd upon her against
hei earnest endeavms to aven them, but, being
thus foieed upon her, she is rndeavoiing to mti t
them as becomes a fice and independent Repub
lie
It has been slid, sir, that our countiy is not
prtpaiedfoi war, that oui shipping will be duven
from the ocean, our cities and towns will be
sacked and destroyed by the enemy, that our
harbor? and sea coasts are unfortified, that oui
frontier is defenseless, that our western lakes are
without a single armed ship to maintain the honor
of the countiy for a single day thcie All this
may be o good ai0umcnt addiesscd to our appic
hensions, but it is not one that looks to tho u^hty
orto the hon >i of the nation Giant that we
have none of the bulwuks adverted to, giant
that we are less prepared foi wui in those ic-
spects, than we could wish to be is it not Hue,
neveitheless, tha' we aie as well piepaied as we
ever have been—as well piepaied as we can evei
hope to be,uiitil war shall be upon us' Su, our
preparation for war is not, it nevei has been, in
armed ships, m fortified towns, or in a standing
army Such preparation is not consistent with
the characteristic economy of oui institutions
The preparation for wai upon which the United
States have relied heretofoie in all times, and
upon which they will rely at all times hereaftei,
more than upon all things beside, consists in the
nghteousness of their cause, and in the settled
determination of the people to sustain and defend
it at all hazards
Sir, this prepaiation is now felt throughout this
country upon the present emergency And, if
our Republic should exist a thousand years, and
should continue throughout that period to add to
her physical strength, to enlarge her prosperity,
to develop her resources, and to add to the num-
ber and chivalry of her population, in the same
piogresston as has characterized her marsh, in
these particulars, since the 4th of July, 1776, she.
will still be, comparatively, as destitute of armed
ships, of fortified towns, and of a standing army,
as she is at the present moment Maine, sir, is
unprepared for war With her three hundred
miles of sea-coast, she has not a fortification upon
it which might not be successfully stormed, as
now circumstanced, by an oidinary gun-boat.
With her three or four hundred miles of interior
frontier, she has not so much as a log cabin for-
tified, besides the one elected within a few days
by the determined spirit of her own citizens And
yet, sir, she has the prepaiation of a righteous
cause, and the determination of a biave people
engaged in her support, and these make her strong
in hei preparation forwar,a d with this prepara-
tion ¡.he has taken the field in defense of her
rights and her teiritory Fjom that field she will
not be driven

SPEECH OF HON. R. H. MENEFEE,
OF KFNTUCKY,
In tul Housl, oi Rmhesematiyes,
Match \, 1839,
On the bil! giving tho President additional powtr for the
deleave ol ilie Limed ¡states, &e
Mr MENLI LL said that the debates on this
quebtion had been charaeteuzed by such ability
and fullness of detail as to spaie him the neces-
sity of going at length into the particulars of the
controveisy between the two nations, or í ven into
the main points on which the title of the United
States to the temtory m dispute is founded He
pioposed but to state the conclusions to which he
liad come respecting this contiover&y—conclu-
sions drawn from an anxious and solemn consid-
eration of all the information attainable thiough
tho protiacted coirespondence between the two
nations, their debates in Paihament and Con-
gress, or other sources within his reach, and to
express Ins opinion upon the mcaauics which the
existing emergency demanded
'lhat the whole temtoiyin dispute belonged
lightfully to the United ¡states, under the treaty
ofl7b3, he did not for one instant hesitate with
the utmost confidence to pionoiiiice It is demon-
suable, it has bei n alieady demonstiated iNoi,
sir, (sud he,)do 1 hesitate, with iqualconfidi nee,
to pionounce that the claim to that temtory on
the pait of Great Britain is altogether unfounded,
and attempted to be supported by aiguments too
untenable and frivolous, in my opinion, to com
poit with eithei the dignity oi candol of a great
nation The ri'ht, thiiefore, being most mam
fi stly with the United Stites, the party who con-
tests it on the palpably msulhcient giounds as-
sumed by Gicj.t Bntain must be held answerable
before the wot Id foi whatevei evils so unlounded
apretension may tend to pioduce All nationsaie
tenacious of temtory,and territorial disputes are,
fiom then nature, more likely than almost any
othci to engender mutual nutation and exispei
ation, in winch both parties aie liable to en But
the 'ault, and consequent lesponsibihty for it, all
lie with the party which, by the assertion of an
unjust cluro, thus exposes both to such conse-
quences It is in this Mew only that I now con-
sider the question of iiff/ii to the disputed territory,
and not as furnishing a reason foi the measuies
pioposed now to be taken by the United States.,
for these mensures flow fiom other reasons than
those of conviction of this right, and of a fixed
resolution to maintain it They flow from an
emeigency which has lately arisen—new and pe
cuhai
Gieat Britain, sir, claims exchisne jurisdiction
over the disputed temtoiy until the dispute shall
have bei n settled Such a claim, urged merely
i  negotiation, would, I think, be unieasonable
enough Assuming that the right is doubtful,
(which it is not,) it is manifest that the claim,
meiely as such, of one nation is entitled to no
higher respect than of anothei It cannot be pre-
sumed, in advance of negotiation and ad|ustment,
that the claim of either is supeuor Independent
Powers must, in this íespect, be regaided as
equals. To concede that the undivided pieten-
sions of either shall be invested with a validity
aM force denied to the other, is to concede away,
in some sense, an essential attribute of sover-
eignty. Yet Great Britain, by her claim to ex-
clusive jurisdiction ovei the subject of disputo
until it shall havebeen adjusted,airogatesto hei-
self, undoubtedly, this inadmissible supenouty
over the United States Nor is the reasoning by
which this claim is attempted to be m untamed
loss objectionable than the claim itself, a ícason-
mg founded on the assumption of the principle so
humiliating to the United States, that then inde-
pendence, nationality, territory ,weie den ved fiom
Great Bntain by giant imparted by the tuaty of
peace of 17¡S3, and that, theiefore, Gieat Bntain
is to be piesumed to lematn m possession until
there has been a trnnsfei in fact Sn , the treaty
of 1783 gi-anted nothing—neither independence,
nationality, nor temtoiy, that tieaty but acknowl-
edged them For the foundation of all their in-
estimable rights, the United States point not to
the treaty of peace, but to the glonous war of
independence which preceded it—to occupation,
and to the deeds of the noblest ancestry that ever
bled in the cause of freedom—to conquest Sir,
I repeat, Great Britain granted nothing, she but
acknowledged and recognized what the United
States had tin mselvcs accomplished—without her
and against her
This claim, therefore, to exclusive jurisdiction,
until the ttimmation ol the contiover&y, if uiged
l by Gieat Lntain, on the general icasoning hith-
I erto advanced in its suppoit, in the most unex-
ceptionable foim of negotiation, it would be tho
j duty of this Government, under evei v obligation
of niteiest and honoi, to repel But, sn, Great
Bntain of late i eposes hei claim to exclusive pins-
| diction upon another foundation, which, if exist-
ing as represented by hei, exhibits it m an im-
posing if not íriesistible light, which is, that the
United States, in the pi ogress of the negotiation,
had conctded,6i/eapítcií agieement, the right now
contendedfor 1 hisallegedagieementisasserted,
in positive terms, both by tin provincial authoi -
j íties of NewBiunswick and the Butish Minister
j heie Sn, I (in common, I believe, with tho
Í whole country) was snrpnsed, absc lately as-
tounded, by this annunciation, so confidently
I madi, and fiom souiees so respect ibl >, of the ex-
| istence of such anagiccrmnt If this Government
had so agieed, the nation was of eouise bound,
in faith and honor, to íespect the agieement, no
matti i how ni|Uiious to oui mteiesis or humili-
ating to our ehaiaetei Su , I cannot expiess the
intensity of the solicitude Í felt to hear the ic-
sponsc which our Government should make to
this alleged agreement Could it be possible that
any Administiation had been so unmindful of in-
teiest, and íegardless of honor, as to have made
such a concession > 'I his suspense was of short
duration I nowre]Oice, sir,profoundly, and with
patnotic thankfulness, (as doubtless the nation
does too,) over the prompt and unequivocal as-
surance of our Government that no such agieement
does, oi eiei did, exist The IJntish Minister is
uspectfully but earnestly invited to point to the
alleged agieement lie his failed to show it, he
cannot show it, nor can his Government Sir, it
does hot exist, and we are 1 ft to hope that ltq
existence has been tilled under an unintentional
misconception of the negotiations between the
two Governments Unsuppoited, theiefoie, by
this pietended agreement, the claim of Great
Britain to exclusive jurisdiction is thrown back
upon the untenable and wholly inadmissible lea-
soning in which it ouginatcd
But, sir, if the giounds which this Government
has invariably assumed in resisting the claim by
Great Britain to exclusive jurisdiction needed ad-
ditional support, it is furnished by an explicit
understanding between the two Governments that
neither pai ly ¡>hould exei t exclusive jui isdichon pend-
ing the negotiation, but should be confined to tha
poitions of the teiritory in dispute, then in the
possession and under the juusdiction of each,
without the right to enlaige then then existing
possession or jurisdiction in any respect what-
evei This understanding (unlike the agieement
feet up by the Butish functionaiies) admits of
being pointed to and shown It has been shown
The correspondence shows it Nor can its exist-
ence be contested This understanding, by itself,
aims the United States with an argument against
the claim of Gieat Britain (if the question is to
