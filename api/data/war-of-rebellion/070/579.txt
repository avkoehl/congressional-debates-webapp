Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

Two men were at my farm yesterday that came from South Branch Valley; passed Fort Pendleton, and were not halted; saw no picket; saw soldiers fishing, but were not halted. Write to Godwin at once and order him to stop all travel past that post; to blockade the roads and paths thoroughly. Say to him if he does not attend to his duty better I will have him dismissed the service.
