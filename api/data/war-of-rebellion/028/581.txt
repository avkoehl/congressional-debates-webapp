HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH NEW YORK ENGINEERS,Washington, November 14, 1862.

Captain BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Engineer Brigade:

CAPTAIN: I did not receive the order of the 6th instant from general headquarters until 2 p.m. of the 12th, when I took immediate measures to carry it out. My orders from General Woodbury this morning were to carry out the orders received from Headquarters Army of the Potomac, except mounting the train on wheels; that was to be deferred.

The boats are here, and the train could be mounted ready to move on Sunday morning if we were furnished transportation. To move it I should require about 270 additional horses.

Yours, truly,

I. SPAULDING,

Captain.
