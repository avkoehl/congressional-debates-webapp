instructed, when those who voted for the resolution
did not consider it as such It was deceptive in
relation to the constituents of the Assembly, for if
they were to complain of the exercise of a power
which did not belong to the Legislature, the lan-
guage is so equivocal, that it would be easy to deny
that it was intended as an instruction
The studied ambiguity of the resolution appears
to be a fiand on the principles and consciences of
those who passed it, an attempt to get round their
own principles, and to act on what they may have
supposed to be the principles of their political oppo-
nents, without recogms ng the same themselves
This, if he might be permitted to quote the old
adage, it. what may be called " whipping the
Devil around the stump "
Although these two grounds of objection were
each believed to be sufficient to explain and justify
the course he and his colleague felt it a duty to
pursue, and although this resolution does not pro-
perly come within ¡he principle of instruction, yet
they had no niohto avoid an expression of their
opinions on the principle itself He had no desire
to place *he justification ot .us conduct on a p'ea of
abatement, or even a special plea in bar, but pie-
ferred to meet the broAd principle on. which the
General Assembly professed to act, although they
disavowed it themselves He rather rejoiced at an
opportunity to set himself right on thit subject
Mr N said that no prmc pie was more gros>ly
pervertel to the selfish purposes of parly than this,
and tie thoug1 ' it high time that it was íescued from
such palpable abuse This w is,, to some extent,
true of boih of the two g eat political paities, but
more especially of the Federal or Whig party He
believed they never resp/cted the principle when
applied to themselves, yet weie always ready to
use it as an instiument against their opponents.
He co ild not admit that a party who denied
the doctrine of instruction, who disregaided it
themselves, and treated it a  odious, could, with
any semblance of justice or propriety, apply it to
otheis It had become a meie engine ol pait\
warfare On this point he might diflci fiom some
of hi  fnends, but, for one, he could lot cari) his
respect for any principle so far as to btcome an
instrument ot its gross abuse and perversion—a
perveisiou which destroys the principle and occa-
sions the most manifold injustic He intended
to have no pro'essions in his political c-e d wh  h
he did not carry out in piac ici and it w as, m his
judgment, imponible thit any principle can be
faithfully adhered to in practice by one political
party, wh eh is entnely disfgarded by another
The old ,'dige is founded in good sen«e "that it is
a bad ru'e which will not work both ways "
The abuse of the pruciple has arisen fiom push-
ing it too far Afi instruction, whatever may be
its terms, ought never to be regarded as possessing
the absolute authority of a Jaw, or as canying with
it an unqualified obligation to obey or resiga
There is no such right or power in the Leg slature,
and the attempt to set it up and exercise it, has veiv
nearl) brought the entire doctrine into ridicule and
contempt It has taken from it th* respect, influ-
ence, and authority, which juslly belong to it when
the principle is correctly unders'ood and honestly
applied
In respect to the proceedings of his own Legisla-
ture, he regretted that he hid fel* it a duty to speak
of them m the terms he had But they were un-
worthy of the General assembly, and d d no credit
to the State The resolution without having the
torm or substance, or renting on the principle, of a
imndatory instruction, was so worded as to have
that "npearance, and to place his colleague and
himself m a situation either to obey it, 01 to be sub-
jected to a charge of violating the instructions of
Uie General Assembly, and of being held up to
their constituents and tnecountrj mtnat light This
had rendered it necessary for them to pursue the
course they had
He was surprised at the whole proceeding, and
at the <nrange reasons assigned against the Indepen-
dent Treasury bill Surely they ought to have
been informed on this subject, neifher pains or ex-
pense had been spared to do it Great exertions
had been made, and much money expended, to en-
lighten the people.    Both in the State and out of it,
much had been done. Agents had been sent on
here for aid, and the Stale had been literally flooded
with speeches from this place The mail  have
groaned under their weight But these mighty
labor  do not appear to have produced any very
important results, if we are to judge from this reso-
lution
Mr. N asked that the resolution might be lead
and laid on the table
Mr CRITTENDEN said he supposed this reply
to the Legislature of Connecticut was expected to
receive some degree of sanction from the fact of its
hav wg been rend to the Senate of the United States,
foi ho could discover no other reason for leading
it Against allowing it any such sanction Mr. C.
most emphatically protested Ha was wholly un-
willing to let it go out with the appearance ot any
such sanction He w a*- sorry, notwithstanding, to
deprive the Senator of any consolation m his pre-
sent stile of political adversity, and it was with no
personal unKindness lhat Mr C endeavored to
withheld fiom him the sanction desued, but he did
not wish to become in any way accessory to the
promulgation of  uch a document, filled as it was
with mattei derogatoiy to the Legislature and State
which the Senator íepresented
Foi himself ail lis punuples, Mr C said,
when the pleasure of h s L^i ! ituie shouldbemade
known to him m any foim, though he did not pro-
fes to be under the obligation of unlimited and
passive obedience, theie must be cucumstances of
very great potency that would induce him to dis
obey legislative instructions, and they would at all
times obtain fiom him a respectful leanng. But
he must protest against this reply of the Senator,
which denounced the proceedings of the Legisla-
ture as dishonorable, and as a piostitution of the
right of insiiuction, and it even went beyond that,
and obliquely charged the ¡epulis of llu late elec-
tion as having been brought about by the use of
money This sort of language held by a Scnalor
here against his State ought in no wav to be sanc-
tioned by such a body as the United Sities Senate
And hid the "entleman's doctrine of instructions
c me to this, thxt when the msimctions came fiom
political friends they were to be obeyed m the most
obsequious manner, but wnen they cm be called a
party pioject, for a party puipose, then the little
minority, and thei representatives, m all the inso
lence ol oflice, may denounce those instructions as
dishonorab'e, and may say to flic mijonty of the
people of the Stale, you have been seduced by the
minority, and we therefoie will not obey our in-
structions1
The Senator had made use of th  term "we" m
his replv. Whether this was meant to include his
colleague, or whether the gentleman meant to
speak m the royal style, Mr C did not know
But however that was, Mr C was borry to  ee the
spit it in which gentlemen submitted to their politi-
cal retirement The) had gone beyond their depth
in a sea of glety, that was all, and when they were
biou^ht back, and had conned their lessons in the
fchool of adversity, Mr C thought they might per
hap  be brought to their senses, and made useful
membcis of society in their proper places
Mi SMITH <f Connecticut observed that he
rose, at this t me simplj for the pnrpn-,6 of «atisfy-
in¿ the Scrator from Kentucky [Mr fnirit voün]
that his colleague did not express himself in the
plural to indicate hitasen only as having given the
reply to >ne L gislatuie of Connecticut, but had his
sanction n every thing said in that answer If,
sir, said Mi S we are to be admonished here by
the nonorabie Senator from Kemuck} for having
improperly given an answer to the instructions of
the Legislature of our State, he appiehended that
the o-entleman might have some feeling on tins
subject, and with some good reason, as the gentle
man seemed to find fault with expressions «rule
here, as being unkind and unjust towards the Le-
gislature of Connecticut, whj gave the^e instruc-
tions Money, the honoi able Senator .ay, was
stated by my honorable colleague to have been dis-
tributed, influencing the action of the people in that
State, which procured the result which produced
the majority in that Legislature I have no doubt
of it, and am willing to express it here and else-
where, and   for that reason am willing that  >t
should go abroad under1 my hand, in connecttoa
with that of my colleague, lhat this Legislature
came into power under extraordinary circum-
stances, by various means, not necessary to enter
mio here. By this means, however, I am prepared
to say, and that gentleman too, if he lives twelve
months more, will say that they came into power
without the approbation of the people themselves.
But why did gentlemen show so much feeling in
regard to the people of Connecticut? Is he so inti-
mately cormected with Ihem? And if so, I desire
to know how it is that he became so connected.
Sir, one of the means used to produce the result I
have referred to, was the sending of missionaries
from the State of Kentucky and elsewhere, to
opeiate on the good people of Connecticut, to assist
in bringing about that lesult from which these in-
structions emanatsd. Who are those persons'!
They are too well known m that State to be neces-
sary to name them here. Are they the persons who
wete intimately connected with the late tragedy?
Has the honorable gentleman himself been so con-
nected with that tragedy, that he should express
this bitter feeling about th  answer of himself and
colleague? It so, let him enjoy it I assure him
that all the advantage gained in. sending that mis-
sion to Connecticut, will not contribute much to
the success ol the cause he advecates Taking it
altogetb.tr, the mission, and the catastrophe that
followed the authors, will not gain as much as they
calculated on Sir, by what means it commenced-;
who had anv agency with it, who concocted it, and
what pioduced this result, if the honorable Senator
supposed he had contributed any thing to it, I am
satisSed that he should have the full benefit of it.
But lhat he should step between the Senators from
Connecticut and their Legislature, and admonish
them, I deny that he has ihe right He may have
the full benefit of that tcmporaiy revolution, tor I
am satisfied tnat ii will bo but tempoiary
I have nothing more to sij, lhan to satisfy this
Senate that this answer of myself and colleague
had my full assent If the honorable Senator fiom
Kentucky has any peculiar interest in the State of
Connecticut, I have no objecti m to his exercising
it, but I am not accountable to him or to any body
else for my conduct towards the Legislature of my
St?ie I will forbear to suggest ths means that
weie made use of, to place this Legislature in
power, to enable them to give these instructions
no further than barely to allude to the circum-
stances, which perhaps excite the feelings of a
Senator here But are we to be charged with im-
proper conduct, with insolence for answering
them, when they undertook to instruct us to vote,
under a principle 'vhich they tnemselves declared
unsound? tf this placed them m an exalted position
in the opinion of the Senator fiom Kentucky, I
have no objection A Legislature undeitakes to
instruct Senators to disobey the Constitution ol the
country, when this very Legislature says that they
Ihemselves do not believe that it ought to be done
in lhat particul ir They virtually say we consi
der the punciple^ on which these instructions are
based, are unsound vet we undertake not only to
act for oarselves, but for the people you represent
If they hlVi, placed themselves in this position,
is it wrong for us to say to diem m reply, that they
have ac ed improperly—that they have exercised a
povvei which they themselves say dies not exist?
Are we, said Mr S to sit by, and hear ourselves
denounced for giving our leasons for not obeying
instructions, which those who gave them say are
founded on principles wh ch they do not believe in'
Are we to be charged w,th insolence and impro-
priety of conduct, and at the same lime to be told
that it is a matter with which we have nothing to
dot Wmle the Senator from Kentucky denounces
our onduct as unworthy of the seats we hold, I
mu=t believe his denunciation grows out of feelings
«uch as a simple representative from Kentucky
could not possess If l have misiaken the feelings
of the ^enator, and done him injustice, I am soiry
for it
But there must be some cause for this excitement
and for this feeling, and the denunciation of us for
the answer which we, as representatives of Connec-
ticut, have given to our Legislature I have barely
risen to show that if there is any such feeling any
