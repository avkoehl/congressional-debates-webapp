Major WILSON,

Order out scouting parties and ascertain what rebel force there is, if there be really a big force behind your outposts, and put yourself in shape for defense. General McCormick has a thousand stand of arms sent for his militia. If necessary get them to arm the recruits for the Forty-seventh Regiment. Telegraph me frequently and fully. If line breaks down send messenger by special train or mounted here.
