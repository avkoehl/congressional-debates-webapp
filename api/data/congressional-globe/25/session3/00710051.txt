and other Opposition presses, he was not disposed
to speak If the Senator looks to such sources
for coircctinfoiimUion coicermng the acts of the
executive offici is, he was not disposed to follow
hini into that fii Id How long tne Senatoi had
been in the habit of jud0ingof the measures of the
Adra nisttation from mfoimation donved fiom
sueh souices, Mr N could not say, but he be
nev d the time was not distan^ when the Senator
íi di little confidence n the statements of these
Arncjf b nk orsans as he had himself
Tins, Mr Piesidcnt, is the testimony on which
such senous charges are made against the Admtn
istration, and sustained with so muchconectness
and warmth     And not only have the past acts of
the Executive and Secretary been condemned on
intelligence derived from such sources, but the
futuie and intended measures of the Admmistia-
tion are ascertained from the same honest chan-
nels* of mfoimation     Looking at the Adminis
tration through such a medium, both to discover
what it ha1? done and \ hat it intends to do, who
can doubt that the Senator will form a most can
did and impartial judgment of its measures and
purposes5
Mr N said he did not propos to go into the
various matteis which had been introduced in o
this debate, oi to notice the numerous chains and
insinuations against the Admimsti ation which had
been thiown out
His principal object was to call attention to
several positions which had been assumed The
first and most important was the deel nation that
the seven year1*' wai was at an end, th it the
Government h \d n it only given up th c mti st,
but had been oblig d to iu cumb to the ban! ,

Tins  is  the languige, mi, which  out a  few
months since wes almost daily heaid within these
walls   Hostility to the banks and the cieditsvs
tern was the gnat and besetting sin of the Auimn
l&tiation, which swallowed up all otHeis     Put
whit do we li^u  now fiom the same quartet
Why, sn , will it he la lieved when it goes fotth
to th   countiy, that a Senator who was most zeal
Otis md constant in declaiming and repeating the
charg s of hostility to the banks, is now the first
to an ngn and condemn, unheard, the same Ad
nuiiisti ition for having teimmated a war which
was dichied to be so destructive to the best in
teicsts of the country—of having succumbed to
the mcnstei, and made a di°honoiable peace, and
foimed a duiigcious alliance with him 3
What, si', aie we to think of this' Were gen-
tlemen sincere'    Did they really believe in the
actual existence of a war, piosecuted by the Gov-
ernment against the banks and its ruinous consc
quences, whieh filled them with such feaiful ap
prehensions, or were they attempting to hold up
this bugbeai to fnghten *he peop'e, to alarm their
imagina ions, to i xaspeiate  then  feelings, tne
moie eilec ually to en'ist them in the only war
which had ai y leal existence in fact—a war by
the politicians, aided by the banks, upon the Ad
miniotiation and a majority of the people who
sustained it
Surely, sir, if the gentlemen believed in the ex-
istence of the bank war, of which they have had
so much to say, and the evils of which they have
portrayed in such glowing colors, they should be
the fii st to rejoice at the return of peace—at a res
toration of a good understanding between the
Government and the banks
These gentlemen of the aimed neutrality appear
to bp vei y difficult to please   During the last two
sessions, the whole  bin den of thetr complaints
was the hostility of the Administration to the
bantts, and now they anaign the same Adminis
tiation, pursuing the  same general policy, foi
being too fnendly to 'he banks, and for forming
an alliance with fvlr Riddle's bank   Butwhethei
these neutialitv politicians aie pleaded with this
new aspect rf things or not, it rnu"t be giatify
ina: to all who have confided in then speeches and
dcclaiations  heietofa e, to leain that this great
soutce of danger and mischief to all their mtei
ests—the bank war—is at an end
Mi N said theie was another point which
seemed to be conceded in this debate, which he
also tho i°- it t sab] ot if j ist congi \tulation It
was, that the ding i of a Trcasuiy bank, which
vv is o a aim ng at the list sission, had entii ly
disiip n d 1 he i Hint! y had escaped that awful
pen] W were then ti'd that that "exeeiable

of th G >iem nent and the diafts and transfe s
if the Tieisu i Tie sub Trcasuiy plan has
been in prietic 1 opeiation during the past year,
and do s not appe u to have lesultcd in aTrcasuiy
oa lk Ins ead of that, we are now told of an
alliame between the lieasuiy and the Bank of
tne United States
Iheie was another subject of congratulation,
which, if not conceded m the debate, was, he
thougl t, fully esfabhshed by what we have wit
ncssed in th s occasion He alluded to the " half
wiy house ' That wis gone, demolished, and

the imminent danger ot a Tieasury bank, and of

clear We have, howevei, it seems, an aimed
ueutrility, a belhgeient peice paity, or neutrals
who c operate with one ot the bell geicnts Of the
' aimed neuti ihty ,' of wl ich the Senator fiom
Vn^inia seems ti admit himself the head, he
would say nothing, as in did not pcihaps u idei

he had wa ched the couist of them for hit'y

Demociatic paity at fiist assume the chai letei of
neutrals, or no paity men and whilst in this
ti msition state, which was sometimes a longei
and sometimes a shoilei period, they cairy on a
war aganM then old ftiends and old principles,
under then old flag This, su, has been the com se
of neutral and no party politicians in this coun
tiv Whilst maintaining the character of armed
n  utrals, they fight under a piratical flag, and at
the end of six months or one year, they throw to
the winds the Demociatic banner, and take their
statimio the íanks of their former enemies, when
often having, for some bnef months, declaimed
eloquently against paity and party spirit, they
become the most mtoleiant, malignant, and per-
secuti ig partisans the country has ever witnessed
For the truth of tins statement, he appealed to
the political history of the countiy, ho appealed
to existing facts Look round these Halls, look
into the State Legislatures, east your eye over
the whole country, take a view of recent alai ru-
ing scenes which are now acting in one of the
great States of this Union, and then say who
aie the most violent, unscrupulous, and reck-
less political partisans in the country, who push
selfish party measuics to the greatest extremes,
breaking over the barriers of the Constitution and
1 iws, and trampling right and justice undei their
feet It will be found, sir, m almost every in-
stance, that the bold, daring, and íeckless politi-
cians, aie deseiteis fiom the populai cause, and
at some shoit penod.havi declaimed eloquently
against the ibusesof naitv Air N said he spoke
of geneial panciples, but made no appluation of
then, he passed no judgment upon the motives
and purposes of any one, he presumed all here"
to be actuated by high and honoiable motives
The Senatoi fiom Vnginia concludeu with an
tloquent lopeal to the fin nils of the Administra-
tion to tlnow asi.h then  giovehng, selfish, party
pulposos, to bieak asundtr the trammels of party,
and elevate  their views  tothegieat interests of
then country    This appeal, sn, under othei cir-
cumstances, might have been commendable, it
might have been woi thy of the Senatoi, and hon-
oiable to the nobleCommonwcalihhe itpresents.
i' But under what < ncumstances was it made ?    It
'  was the conclusion of a speech uncalled for by
the occisión, intemperate in its tone, and through-
, out chaiactenzcd by unfounded and unsupported
| chaiges andcuminauons against the "Vdmimstra-
1 tion and all its supposteis
If a professed fi lend (said Mi  N ) should meet
j  me in th" stieet, and atter abusing me with hard
I woids, beat me ovi i the head with his cane,and
| then say to me, " on, let us now be fi lends, these
ij strifes and contentions not only lcndirus unhap-
'| py, but they aie an not uig to the whole communi-
I, ty, h t usi levat   oui feelings above these low and
I   bise passions "    In such a ca«e, I should be a
little inclined to doubt tho suieenty of the eloquent
l' appeal made to my moie elevated feelings
I       Who h is betiayed any warmth o*"party feeling
in this debate, or dining the piesent session unless
it be the Senatoi himself?
He speaks ot the high and exalted considera-
tions by which he is actuated, using above the
mists of paity, and looking only to the great m-
tciests of theeiuntiy Of the S natoi's motives,
aims, and purposes, he hid nothing to say, but he
wish d the Bentl innto un lei stand, that however
puie, disinterested, oi e'evated they may be, they
nr not more =o than those if the Senatois\o
whom he iddiessed his ipnoa!
We are ci'led on to d tndon the lumous sub-
Tieasury sihime, and   ire told that it has been
condemned by tl    cmntry    Is the Senator quite
sine he is n< t mistak n ' Occupying the position
he dots, it the head of an  aimed neutialitv, he
|  may not have been  the most ímpaitiai observer
,  of pissing events     Sn, a gieater mistake was
n ver   made     No  impaitiol   observer can have
,   mistaken the elections of the past yeai      They
'  hive spoken  a language which cannot well be
misundcistood     Th   financial question has been
befoie the countiy   it has been discussed, exam-
ined, and is becoming undtistood     The people
have looked at U, not in  IN (Jetills, but at the
gieat pimeiple of th   tntne disconnection of the
finances of the Governm nt fiom  those of the
banks, who desne to us    tin   public monej for
their own benefit, and they ire setisfaed that it is
founded in light and jus ice     riiat is enough for
them   they vv sh to  look no tuithei      Whether
it will  nrjute the banks oi   not, is of no conse-
quence  with  them    if satisfied  the m a«uie is
right and just, they th sire to see it earned out
The mass of the people are honest, and they lova
justice above all things     The only difficulty has
I  been that the subject was not sufficiently under-
stood     Tnat difficulty is passing away    The
people now understand this question, they have
I  examined it and decided upon it    It is no longer
