I had ordered up a portion of Wagner's brigade from Wartrace, but this order I will now countermand.

SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, August 3, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

General Morgan has again telegraphed, urging the necessity of horses for another regiment and for Andrews' battery. Shall I furnish?

T. SWORDS.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 3, 1862.

Colonel SWORDS, Louisville:

Furnish the horses on General Morgan's requisition, but you have not yet filled the demands of other divisions. Horses must by some means be furnished more rapidly.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 3, 1862.

General WOOD, Dechered:

Report upon the relative merits of Dechered, Elk River, and Estill Springs as a large depot. Consider the natural advantages of the points for defense,&amp;c., as well as facilities for protecting supplies.

JAMES B. FRY.

NASHVILLE, August 3, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Colonel Innes sent an engine to Reynolds' without my knowledge and without notice of my dispatches at Huntsville. When can I get the control of trains without this kind of interference? I sent a large force to-day to McMinnville road, and one also to render bridges on the Decatur road safe for heavy engines. I think I can get tools enough at the gun factory and at Brennan's foundry here, without bringing any from Huntsville. It would not be possible to bring them from Huntsville without attracting attention. The establishment where the tools are is in the hands of the United States marshal. Your order will be enough for me to get what I need. I go to Cincinnati to-morrow.

J. B. ANDERSON.

MURFREESBOROUGH, August 3, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

The aggregate numerical force here is, say 1,400, including all scattering detachments, convalescents,&c. It cannot be rated as effective in present condition, perhaps at over 1,000.

CHARLES CRUFT,Brigadier-General.
