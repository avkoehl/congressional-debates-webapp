NEW BERNE, N. C., June 20, 1863-9 p. m.,

Via FORT MONROE, June 21.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just received papers of the 18th instant, containing news of Lee's advance. I am anxious to render all the assistance in my power, and therefore send General Potter, chief of staff, to communicate with you from Fort Monroe. I can send either to Baltimore or Fort Monroe ten regiments immediately upon the receipt of your order to do so. these are nine-months' men, whose term of service has nearly expired, and whose places I am making arrangements to fill as best I can. I can as well spare them now as a few weeks hence. Six of these regiments are from Massachusetts, well drilled, and good fighting men, having all been in several successful affairs. The other four regiments are from Pennsylvania, and are good, serviceable troops. If you want these men, I will send them under good officers. Please communicate your orders to General Potter. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
