ATHENS, ALA., October 3, 1864-7 p. m.

Captain R. H. RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Nashville, Tenn.:

Your dispatch dated Tullahoma, October 2, 10 p. m., received at 6. 30 this p. m. As soon as the rations and wagons arrive I will move, as directed, to Bainbridge. The opinion of officers here is that Buford with his forces has succeeded in crossing the Tennessee. It has been raining heavily for nearly twenty-four hours. I am fearful if it continues during the night Elk River will be unfordable to- morrow. Not having pontoons this of course would prevent my reaching Bainbridge in time. I shall have to wait for my train and supplies, there being none in the country.

11. 45 p. m. -Two railroad trains just arrived loaded with rations and wagons. There are but 175 cavalrymen here.

Brigadier-General.

Captain RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Nashville, Tenn.:

My command on the march; will push forward with all possible dispatch. But twelve wagons came through last night by railroad. I am expecting what wagons they have at Decatur to arrive this morning. Nothing additional as to the movements of the enemy. Strong indications of a rainy day.

Brigadier-General.

ROGERSVILLE, ALA., October 5, 1864-5. 30 a. m.

Captain RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Nashville, Tenn.:

Reached this point with my command at 6 p. m. yesterday, after a hard march of nineteen miles; raining severely during the latter part of the day. Will push forward again this morning in the direction of Bainbridge. I hear nothing of the whereabouts of Forrest and his command. Buford with his forces crossed the Tennessee at Brown's Ferry Sunday evening. It was this force that threatened Huntsville on Friday and attacked Athens on Sunday. From information derived from citizens that I can rely on there are a number of crossings of the Tennessee by fords and boats. It is raining heavily this morning. Having several creeks to cross to-day my march will no doubt be delayed.
