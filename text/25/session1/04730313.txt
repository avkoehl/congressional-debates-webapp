Making public officers depositories—Mr. Nayhr*
H. of Reps.
wtiolr country Notan inch of any part oí that countiy tdiall
be disparaged with my ron-ent Whatevei concerns its honor
ami renown deeply anddeailycencernsme I will scrupulous,
iy respect the rights and feelings of every section of the coun
try, and do all in my power to advance, nothing to retard its
peculiar interests, except wheie they may come into conflict
with some great fundamental principle which must not be
sacrificed I will exert my influence to heal sectional different es,
extirpate petty jealousies, foster a becoming spun of concilia
tien, promote universal harmony among the different portions
of the Union, and make the Union itself as everlasting as
the soil which u embraces With these feelings and with this
determination, I have come mto this House But, on, I never
can and never will amain silent when the rights, or interests, or
character, or insiitutionsof my own immediate constituents are
attacked No, sir, let that attack come from what quarter it
may,I willbeeverprompttooftermy feeble resistance, andin
terpose my voice in their just vindication1
I now beg leave, Mi Chairman, to make a few remarks more
immediately connected with the bill under consideration tiy
the madness and folly of her ruler*, our t ountry has been pre
cipuatedte a crisis We have been convened here to meet
that crisis That is, the people and tltb H«use have been so
informed Bxithaoe we met it? At e we meeting it ? No, sir,
we have been called here to do what this House has been doing
for the last six years—to echo the will and further the wishes
of the Executive , to carry out the recommendations of the
President's Message, to cease to be the free representative  of
the people, and to become the pliant instruments of power
Nothing is to be introduced to our deliberations but what the
President has recommended Petitions are presented, and they
aie trampled under foot, plans of iclief are suggested, and
taey are laid upon the table The people demand from you,
tuough their reniesentatives, a fair and impartial heaung,
a id you meet them with that gag of despotism, the previous
q íesuon And when we ask why is all this, we are impudently
to'd that we must attend to the relief of the Government, that
wahave nothing to do with the people, that the President has
submitted his plans, and that, right or wrong, we must sustain
the n, that he has chalked out to us the line of our legislative
duties, and that we must follow that line, toe the mark—yes,
toe the maik, is their phrase—and then go home and tell our
constituents that we have slavishly done our master s bidding
Sir, it is by conduct like this that our country has been pie
cipitaled from the height of prosperity into the very depth  of
distress This House is r sponsible ¡or much of the evil under
which the people are now groaning Their Representatives m
Congress have been faithless to them They have surrendered
up their independence and become the mere echo of the Presi
dent's will Instead of freely deliberating and choosing what
was beet for the people and the country, they have been watcli
in.* the ever changing countena ce of the Executive, and
a^ erum ng whit were his. wish s and dueimination> and
thus have they been slavishly echoing and ie echoing that will
until the great fundamental interests of the country have been
entirely sacrificed The people have been lost sight of, those
who were their servants nave become their masters I ask
every candid man. whether the legislation of Congress has not,
for many years conformed in eveiy important paiücuíar to the
commands of the Executive"? Whether the íeclamations of the
Administration have not been the law of the land1 Let us
revert to the history of the past, and see what are the lessons
that it teaches
Large majorities of both Houses of Cohgiess passed an act
for the recharter of the Bank of the United States The De
mocratic Legislature of my own State, Pennsylvania, unani
mously recommended it It was vetoed by the President And
what did Congress do? Why, sit, change their opinion—echoed
that veto" Yes, we saw the veiy man who diaughted and ad
vocatedthc bill for recharteimg the bank, (Mr Dallas) piesid
ingatatown meetms d few weeks afieiwaiH, and there op
posin" the very measure of which he was the authui and fa
t íer, ay, turning at the beck of the Piesident,hke Saturnof old,
tt destroy bis own offspring This, perhaps, may have been all
v^ry well, but is it not a remarkable proof that membersofCon
gr ss found it inconvenient to have opinions which did not ex
a<nly conform to those of the Exeeutive1
But, again Congress investigated the situation of the Bank of
t \e United State*, foi the purpose of ascertaining whether it
still continued to be a safe depository of the public moneys
Ttiey found its situation to be sound and wholesome^ and de
dared, bv a large majority, that the deposites should be mini
nued m it according to law The President, however, a 3hott
time afterwards, detei mined otherwise, ordered the Secretai y
of the Treasury to lay violent hands upon the treasures of the
nation to take them from the place where Congress and the
law declared they should be, and scatter them abroad over the
land, by depositing them with the pet banks, there to be used
f >r the purpose o (swelling the deluge of paper money, and of
f edingand pampeung and bloating the demoralizing spirit of
speculation
In sixty diys afterward^ Congress met Well, and what did
members of Congress do ? Did they adheie to their former
resolution? No, Mr, they again suirendeied up then mdepen
dence, again changed then opinion, and again echoed the wül
of the Executive
Then it was that the President foimed his league of pet
banks He conceived and planned and put in opeiatinna pro
ject which, according to his piomise, was to banish bank lags
fiom the community give us the be«¡t of cuirencies, and fill up
the channels of circulation with .jold This was the sole weik
ofiheExecutive and his agents Congtess had nomngtodo
with it lie submitted his plan, however, to Con^re*-,, m the
form of a law, for then approval They hesitated tor a while,
a id grumbled a little, but not daring to disobey, they at length
a am complied with hi" requisitions, went through ill the on
meming forms and idle ceremonies necessaiy to give it a legal
shape foig >t the People and the *. ountry, and again ec wed the
wll of the Executive*
But, sir, it is in \ am to give fmihei examples of the entire
dependence of this House on the Executive The President
tods b en passing our laws' Congress, in truth and m fact has
bad nohmg to do with them' Hib will has been supreme
This House, instead of being the free representative body of the
People, has been the representative of the Pie&ident'
Bur the bubble has at length burst The glided project of
which so much was promised and so much expected by an m
jured and confiding people, is at an end White the people
stood anxiously awaiting the realization of its piomised advan
tages,iB suddenly exploded, and involved them and their busi
ness, the country, us exchanges, currency and prospeiity m a
scene of confusion ami distress unparalleled in th~ annals of
our civil history The Government irom a hollow and bloat
ed appearance of sanity, became suddenly bankrupt The
people were overwhelmed with distress, and from every quar
ter of the country a&ked relief from the evils that had come un
on them
Meeting, then, under these circumstances, I ask, had we not
a light to expect that Congress once more would resume its
independence, and attend faithfully and feailessly to the busi
ness of their constituents, and that the Aministration would
now aband n its piojects, and give over its attempts to sway
and subjugate and enslave the representatives of the country"*
But have our expectations hpen realized? Whit have we been
about? What have we done? Let it  see whether we have
not again been subserviently echoing the will oí the Executive
Our first act was to pass a bill loi the postponement of the
payment of the fourth instalment to the States to withhold fiom
them the sum of upwudsof nine millions of dolíais, which, by
the act of 3d June, 183j, we had contiacted to putm their pos-
esión By that law it is provided " that all the money m the
Treasury of the United Sutes on the first of January, 1837, re
serving the sum of rive millions of dollars, should be deposited
with the Sutes m piopoitiou to their respective representation
in the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States "
Under tin  law, it becam the duty of theSecretaiy ol the Trta
sury on ihe first of lanuacj, 1837, to reserve five millions, out of
it foi the useof the Government, and approptiate the balance
whatever it might be to the S'ates as a'ready mentioned I he
Secretary of the Treasury performed this duty, and found that
there were upwaids of forty two millions of dollars in theTrea
sury He re&erved tbe five millions, and then announced to the
different States of the Union that there was in the Treasury,
specifically set apart for them, the sum of thirty seven millions
of dollar , to be paid to them in four instalments The States
agreed to receive the money Thiee instalments of the money
they did receive The four h and last instalment, of between
nine and ten millions of ddlars, was to have been paid to them
on the first of this month This is a plain, unvarnished
statement of the case Thus we see that on the first day of
January last there was m the Tieasury thirty seven millions
of money, specifically set apart by the law for the Slates
There it was The Secietaiy of the Treasury counted it,
and declared it to be thete Now, why has not this money
been all paid to the States? Was it because this House
passfd i bill for the postponement of the last payment? No,
sir, but because this Administration had previously used this
money f>rthe  own purposes They, Martin Van Buien and
his Administration, betrayed the trust reposed m them squan
dered this money, and, when the lepiesentatives of ihe people
assemble here in special session, we ai e informed by the Pipm
dent and hi' *sectetiiy of the Tteasmy that the u oney that was
in ihe Trea uvv ioi the S(ate« is sror e h \s ev ipoi ated m 1 tl it
we w ill li tve i) ¡ Oo pu c he p lymer t ot me oí i h i í it 1 hus
wc sec that tf^ money was used by the Administration Ine
President and his policy have postponed the payment of the
fouith instalment Congress has had no hmg to do with it The
money wastheie foi the States on the 1st of January last When
we met here in eight months afterwards, it was not there Sup
pose the bill for postponing its payment had not been parsed,
could the Sutes have got the money? No Why? Because
the Administration had previously used the money that was
specifically set apart for them Thus you perceive that the
Executive postponed the payment of it, and, after doing this,
he very modestly calls upon Congiess to pass a law to do what
he had previously done' Well, and what did Congress do1*
Why, again they echo the wi'l of the President, pass a law post
f)onmg what had alieilybeen postponed, and declaring a so
eran lalsehood to the whole country—¡bat we ve& that we had
withheld from the people of the State-- nine mi'ltons and a half
ol money when lUiai been done months cetore by the Execu
tive mleisot our countiy '
Ihis is the fust exhibition of the independence of this
body1 If we continue thus to comply with the behests of
power, and to delude and betray the people, I ask, m the
name of Heaven, what is to become of our country and its
free institutions?
(Here the House took its usual recess Aftei the rece&s,
Mr Naylor resumed }
Mr Chairman, the embarrassment incident to my novel
situation, and the excitement which hurried me on to vindicate
Northern people, sustain Northern institutions, and to show
their effect upon the community, caused me to forget this
morning some of the topics that 1 had intended to intioduce,
and to enlarge on othei^ that I «xpected onlv to have glanced
at It is too late however to tal e them up now I will go
on, therefoie wheie I lett oft
The second gieit measuie which ihe Administration com
manded you to piss, and which you did pass, was the bill foi
the manufacture of ten millions of Treasury notes \es,ten
millions of paper money—ten million  not of bank rags, but
Government lags—ten million*! of old continental paper—en
millions of shin plasters' And is it possible that these aie the
fruits of those long years of exciting convulsing distiacting
experiments, which out ruler* promised us ¡should piodure
such a safe and convomentcunency and flood the whole land
with gold* Ay,gold gold wastheciy andnow we have gold
with a vengeance' IV bannei of oui mlei*. has bad for us
motto, notour country, noi liberty nor patriotism nor union,
nor any other ennobling or inspnmg sentiment, no, sir, but
that miserable and meicenary promise « for gold, gold, gold "
Foi years have our people been mocked and deluded with
the empty piomise of gold And now at tbe very moment
when they leach toith their expecting hands to possess it,
like the gold which is said to reward a bargain with the
Pnnse or Darkness, it tuina in then gra. p into dust and
a^heb' The Government has been taking it togethet from
all quiitersof theeirth They ha>e wrung it with an non and
unrelenting gra*p from the possesion of the people They have
fon el it out of rn ctilition It is m mey no longer It is now
rm rrhandi<=e It is bought and sold as you would buy jour
biea 1 or any other necessary oi convenience of life The peo
pie are forced to buy it in order to pay their debts to the Govern
ment And whir does the Government do with if* pay it bark
to the people* No, sn no but magnanimously gives it to the
office holder*' rheoffice holdeis then sell it to the people at a
profit of tiom seven to twelve per cent The peop'e againpaij
utothe Government, from which, as before, it immediately
passes to the ofhee holders, who again sell it to the people dt a
laige profit Thu" it moves round and round m one continued
and contracted circle, cursing the people, and taking at every
turn from their hard earnings the amount of premium paid for
it, and enriching the pampered office holder just m proportion
as it robs them In the mean time, the office holders have got
the Government exclusively to themselves They have all the
gold to themselves They tell us that the Government and the
people muit be separate and distinct, that it was never intended
that the Government should sympathise with their sufferings,
or extend relief to their distresses And how, sir, does this
golden Government, with its immense piofessions, pay its own
debts? What do they give to the hard toiling mechanic—the
aged feeble, tottering, war worn soldiei of the Revolution? And
what has the countiy for a currency1 Why, rags, rags, not
" bank rags ' alone, no, (for they grow more scarce eveiy day)
but all kindd oi lags—a complete piece of patch woi k—an un
di tmguishedgathenng together of rottenness and confusion
\nd, t<i ciuwn the whole, the President and his gdded paitisans
have passed the bill foi the manufacture of ten millions more
of rag>, with which still further to ciuse the countiy—the bill
(reatmgten millions oí paper money for the people1
In the name of Heaven, I ask when will this evil end1 When
will membeis of Con?rt*ss be member* of Congress, break the
shackles that bind them to the blind and dark and ferocious
spirit of powei, and stand forth the free repiesenta'ives of the
country9
Mr Chan man, what an awful reckoning must the people
have with those in powef* hur the account must be made up
sooner oi later, between them and tho«e íulerswho hdvebeen
ptomistng only to deceive them—sporting with their hopes—
trampling down thfir interests—marring their enterprises, and
biuismg their tenderest sympathies The day ol reckoning
?nust rome,M>i/¿come' A^ certainly as truth must prevail over
eiror, as certainly as rights must he vindicated and injuries
redressed, so ceitamly will the people have justice, ay, and
vengeance too for the many wionss with whit h a long course
of rm^ule hit visited them We have already heard the
rumbling at a distance The volcano will burst forth I warn
gentlemen—I warn the Administration, to " flee fiom the wrath
to come"'
But, sir, I have again been hurried beyond my subject I
intended to bave alluded to the 1 reasuiy note bill only to show
that this mea^u re, like all others, had been passed in conformity
with the Piesident's will
The opposition in this Hou e did all that reasonable men
could do to pievent its passage One submitted a plan for
the collection of the debts owing by the depoiiu hank*, and
showing conclusively tha1, by this means, the Government
could get their money fiom the banks, and be saved the morti
fymg expedient of issuing ten millions of rag money But no,
it would not do Hispiopo ition was not listened to Another
gentleman submitted a plan foi the sale of the bonds, which
weie given by the Dank of the \ nited States, and not yet due
to the Government proving >ati->factonly ihit tin*  would en

TreasJiy notes No, they would have Iicasury note-. The
President had recommended them, and of course his re
commendation must become a Jaw So accustomed are
the President and heads of Depaitments to consider their
recommendations as having the force of law, and so cer
tain was the Secretary of the Ireasury that the Trea
sury notes would be issued, that a month before the bill
was passed foi thai purpose, we find him writing circulars to
many of the banks, and a great numbei of the large capitalists
m the countiy, huckstering these very notes about for sale'
Whata humiliating commentary upon the independence of the
people's representatives in Congress'
But, <iir, the Secretary of the Tieasury knew that this Home
would not disiegaid the wdl of the Executive You did again
echo that will The lawts pished The Administration de

evident is the sun in a cloudlet heaven at noonday They
knew t'iat they could deceive the people no longer with the
golden humbuc They have now established their bank You
have oidered the issue of ten millions of its notes to begin with
These are all, and the only gold v. hich the suffering people of
this country will ever get fiom this false and deceitful Adminis
tration' The^e, <ur, are solemn truths, and why should I feai
to utter them'i
What nexti The next great measure that we have recom
mended to us is the last great expenment of those m power,

eaten of its fruits, and, for myself, they aie distasteful to me I
loathe them lam for cutting down the tree that produced
them
Sir, this scheme moposes to place in the hands of individuals
who aio dependent alone tn the will of the President for their
continuance in office, all, yes all the countless millions of the
money of this Government for disbursement and safe keeping
These men are to receive it, hold it, use it, when and as they
please, with no eaithly barner between it and the temptation
to a proprlate it to thLir own nse^ which the personal custody
of such immense treasures must ofiei, than the feeble re-
straints of poor, weak lalhb e human na'ure, ami the feai of
the consequences which might result from an ultimate deiec

How many receivers and holdei s of the public money, or m

man can at piesent determine In I íance, where a similar sys
