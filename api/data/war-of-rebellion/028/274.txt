not the best character; is well known to them, and I have no officer to fill his place.

It is satisfactory to my mind that the rebels have no more intention of going to Harrisburg than they have of going to heaven.

It is only in the United States that atrocities like this are entertained.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Send Tyler's and Allabach's brigades with Porter's corps. Brigadier-General Humphreys will command. General Whipple will remain with you, in charge of defenses.

GENERAL HALLECK'S HEADQUARTERS,

September 12, 1862-11.30.

General S. WILLIAMS,

General McClellan's Headquarters:

Morell is in motion, and will go as far as possible toward Brookville to-night. Tyler's and Allabach's brigades, under Humphreys, will move as soon as possible to-day. I hope to be with you, or near Frederick, to-morrow night, with Morell and Humphreys next day.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, September 12, 1862

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

Ascertain, if possible, by means of your cavalry, the probable forces of the enemy south of the Potomac. Should there be no immediate danger of an attack on that side of the river, I wish to send more forces to General McClellan. In regard to wagons, you must apply to Quartermaster's Department. I have no time for such matters.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ARLINGTON, VA., September 12, 1862-4 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

I have sent out cavalry patrols, and they can find no traces of the enemy this side of Dranesville. I have no means of ascertaining the probable force of the enemy beyond that point.

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Major-General, Commanding
