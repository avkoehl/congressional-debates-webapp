CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, November 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Colonel R. H. Lee is now, or was a short time since, a prisoner of war in Washington in 1862. This wound and a chronic dysentery of several years standing has very greatly impaired his health. He cannot outlive a protracted confinement. He has not been in active military service for a long time and never can be again. At the time of his capture he was a member of a permanent military court. I propose to exchange him for any wounded officer of yours of the same rank in our hands. We have a wounded colonel of yours, Colonel W. B. McCreery, Twenty-first Michigan, who was wounded at Chickamauga. He is doing very well and nearly recovered from his wounds. If there is any other colonel in our hands who even approaches the condition of Colonel Lee, you can select him. This application is made purely on the score of humanity. *

Respectfully,&amp;c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
