HEADQUARTERS,Frederick, June 27, 1863-1 p. m.

What is the state of affairs at the bridges? Has all the Sixth Corps crossed, and at what time? Have you seen or heard anything of General Crawford's command-Pennsylvania Reserves-crossing or near? Headquarters here to-night.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Frederick:

Captain Turnbull has shown me a telegram, asking the state of affairs here. I have been here awaiting the passage and taking up of the bridges since 11 a. m. During this time the cavalry supply train and about two-thirds of the Sixth Corps have crossed on lower bridge. Vermont Brigade and Wright's division are now to cross on upper bridge. The First Division of cavalry have passed, and there is now passing the First Brigade of General Gregg's division. It is now almost entirely across. I understood that this cavalry division was to be the last to cross. I am much in doubt if we can commence taking up the first bridge before sunset, or if we can get the bridges up and the trains started from here before noon to-morrow.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
