other members ol the mess re'olle&t it Ner weie they cot fined
to half a ream of lettet anda half areata of note paper, there
was also a bundle of foolscapj and Squills and sealing-
wax, and lead pencils, and other jirUcl|Ss that I have no pai •
ticnlar recollection of and if thegentleman denies it, as he lias
natyetdone, and wishes to haven'proved, let him cad for a
committee, and I pledge myself improve substantially wnat I
have baid by gentlemen of the Houpefw.io saw them Ihe ar-
ticles and their ch iracter and designation were seen and I no wn
by members of the mess with whom I boarded The leason
why the matter was noticed was, that the o hei mei ibeis of the
me=n beg n to boie me ahaut my large supply oí stationery
at the end of the session At first I thought it had been sent
to me intentionally, but upon exammptior 1 found that it was
for the gentleman from Tennessee, and ihe next morning th°
messenger called and took it away. Who got it all, Mr B said
hefchad not asserted, it had M Blown maiked upon it, and (be
messenger said it was for the gentleman fiom Tennessee He
did not know how much pipei was m each bund!e,orpack02e, he
then supposed they were reams, but, he behevt d, m hi  remarks
he had called them bundles, but they were fudone-, except the
foolscap, which he thought w-asnotqu'te full, and die othtr ai-
ticles mentioned he was as Cc-rtam oí as the pai er Th papei
delivered to the gentleman irom Ten lessee, three /eeks before
the end of the extiasess on, as s aied by the ponina-, ei, he

Mr B said he wou'd add thi , while he would stand by 'he
facts as he had made them, and could prove them, he desued
to say to the Hi use that he wa3 son y he hal brouabf it od >re
it at all, because he desire 1 to be on good teims w th all the
members of the House, and did not wish to have any d fh^u'ties
with any membei, 01 to put any rrember into dim ul íes with
his constituents or do any tmng to wound their ftehngs, Upon

Mr M A COOPER moved that it bestneken out
Mr C said he did not know of any permanent law requiring
such an appropriation. If there was no surh law, the appro
pnation must, of course, be stricken out undei the order of the
Houee But if there was such a law, he wou Id suggest, look
ing to the state of the Treasury, the propriety of suspending
the wotk for the present It was not a mattei of indispensable
necessity
Mr OUSHINGsaid he hoped the motion to strike out would
not pre\ail
This survey was a public enterprise of the highest possible
imponance The cessation of the appropriation at this time
would interrupt the work, and bieakup the es abhshment, and
if hereafter Congress should think proper to resume it, it would
be found that additional expense would be incurred by the in
terruption, at the same time that the prosecution of the work
would he seriously retarded
The survey had now extended from Point Judith, on Long
Island Sound, to the Delaware Bay, and it was rapidly ap
proachinT the Southern coast
In relation to the manner in which the survey had been con
ducted, it would be recollected that the subject had tieenie
fenedto a select committee That committee was sedulous
ly engaged m its investigation, and would, he hoped, soon make
a repoi t suggesting a y improvements or reform that m'ght be
required
Mr STANLY opposed the motion to stiike out The sur
vey, he &atd, was uist approaching the Southern cn-tsf Theie
were «everal fortifications wanted on tbp coa<?t of Georgia, two
01 three of which had be< r very strongly r^co nmfiided, an ! the
only ddíi-uhy in the way of construe ing these *"Oitifi"ati m' was
the want of a survey If the gentlpmar. U">~a Georgia [Mr
Cooper ]theref ire, had regard for the inteie&ts of his ojvncon

wissiUi but,previous to the lnteirnp'icn occasioned by tint
circumstance, the committee had been actively engaged in the
invest gation lie (Mr W ) hoped that the chairman tvguIcTbe
up to morrow, and that the committee would pi oceed with thet
investigation Ail the anises which might be found were ntf 
thing in comparison with the great importance of the work.
The arrest of it had already cost more than its prosecution, ftfr
the time
The survey of New York alone (Mr W said) would: almost
pay for the expense that had been incurred In addition to thaf,
we had the advantage of the education of a scientific corps, to-
pographical and hydrographical, as a school for the army and
navy Looking to these things, the suivey bad already paid
the Government incalculably mure than it had tost, By strik-
ing out this appropriation Congress would only delay the
work, (foi it would certainly he ie\ ivsd,) and make it cost still
more
Mr AYCRIGG, a menber ^ -he select committee, though
differing (he was understood to say) from the gentleman from
Virginia [Mi Wise.] thought that to strike out the appropri-
ation would be an abandonment of the work The committee
had been diligently engeged in the prosecution of its labors;
andShe hoped that the motion to atuke out wooid not prevail.
Mi McKCON said that since the gentleman from Virginia
[Mr Wtób] had appealed to him to bear witi t*>s to the value of
the survey to the city of New York, "fie most cheerfully added,
his testimony in behalf of this great na lonal wofk The survey
had been finished, he believed, along the Long Isiand coast,andm
the harbor of New Yoik The rebUlishad been ofimmeneead-
vantage to the commercial interests of ¡he Union, and satisfied
ashe was of the benefit to the city of New Y tk, he was desi-
