D.
HEADQUARTERS CHEATHAM'S DIVISION,January 3, 1864.

General JOHN K. JACKSON:

SIR: Your note of December 31 is before me. In it you say:

As my (your) report of the battle of Lookout Mountain will not pass through you, I will be greatly obliged to you for your opinion of my conduct on Missionary Ridge on November 25 last, with liberty to use it officially or otherwise, as I may see proper.

In reply I have to say that I saw nothing wrong in your conduct on Missionary Ridge on November 25 last. You were always present to receive and obey my orders, as far as could be done amid the confusion of the day. I left yourself and General Walthall with orders to hold the position then occupied for thirty minutes, and then to follow on to Chickamauga, all of which was promptly complied with.

Yours, very respectfully,

B. F. CHEATHAM,

Major-General, C. S. Army.
