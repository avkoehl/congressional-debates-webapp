anything, ms good against his own predilection in favor of fee
billa. There is nothing express in the Constitution to authorize
the establishment of lee bilis, or the establishment of fees of
any kind. But the system had been a iopted from the usage of
©t¿ier nations In lb36, a law was passed, that receivers of
fees—such as measurers, &c, in the custom houses, who were
in receipt of more than a sufficiency for cc ropensation, (the
limit being $1,500)—¡should pay the excess into the Treasury,
end those who leceived less than a sufficiency, should, in cer
4am cases specified, he remunerated out of the Tre tsury This
"proposition, therefore, in the present case, was not, a* the Sena
tot from Georgia [Mr Bbrriln] supposed new ldBt year, but it
had been settled and sanctioned by Congress ior several years,
m respect to custom hou^e officers It had, indeed, always
been the law to limit the receipts, of coltecoifc and íeceiveisof
public money to fixed amounts as a maximum Besides, on
whom did thece fee bifid m the courts operate f Did they not
operate to a large amount on the United fcUttes Treasury, outof
which laige sums had to be paid annually to these officers m
a class of cases1 and if an excess were got back, it would be
•only refunding to the Treasury pan of what had been drawn
from it
Mr CONRAD observed that, consideru g the State which he
represented was particularly interested, he would claim the
indulgence of the teenage foroffeung a few observatn ns on this
question, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour AOer a few
preliminary ob-ervati ms, he asked what was the enormitv of
the evil complained of, with legard to excess of fees? It was
not that individuals who received the fees made splendid foi
tunes, for he did not know that thete was much misfortune in
accumulating wealth Buttheevd lay beyond that—if lay m
collecting too great an amount, by way of fees He believed,
however, that after the Senator shall have examined the returns
contemplated by this amendment, he vould find that the
amount represented to have been collected by those clerks and
attorneys would not be so grea( as anticipated He would find
that there had been great exaggeration as to the amounts le
ceivable by them And if the ¡senator from New York [Mr
Wright] expected to derive any consideiable amountfiom this
'source to replenish the r\ at tonal Treasury, by th*> adoption of
his amendment, he would be greatly disappointed Theadop
tion of the amendment would not have the effect to relieve the
individuals who are the suitors, and fiom whom the fees aie col
lected, of the exorbitant and extoitionate demands or tax now
levied upon them The evi!, as he conceived, which ought to
be remedied, wa^ this exoibitant tax on the most unfortunate
portionsofthe countiy rhis wa-i the evil, and it struck him
that the amendment was not «such as would reat h the evil He
was glad to hear that the subject had attracted the notice of the
Judiciary Committee, and that that committee had it in con tern
plation to piovide by law a proper remedy for the evil
The evil was one which required the senous consideration of
the Senate, and was one which could not be reached andieme
died by this simple amendmentto an ippropnation bill If the
fees we e too large m amount, they should amend the law au
thorizing the collection of the fees, by dimiaishing theraio
where too great an amount was collected, and at the same time
preserve the principles of the law The question of consti
tutionality, which some Senators argued was involved in this
mode of íaising money to supply the National Treasuiy, he
■would not argue, but if this mjdeof taxation was even coueti
tutional, yet it was a most oppressive and unjust species of
taxation, it was a mode of taxation which operated on only
three communities in the United ¡states, and, at the sametim",
selected the most unfortunate portions of the community those
who were the least able to beai it—the bankrupts There was
neither justice noi humanity in that mode of taxation to sup
ply the lreasury, whn h «¡elected the most unfortunate objects
for it to operate on Such was the effect, if the Senate under
took to remedy the evil complained of, by the adoption of the
amendment proposed Another gieat objection to the amend
ment was, that it held out premiums to di honesfy It author
ized the return ot the amount of fees collected to be made on
the oath of the officer collecting So, if theie should be a temp
tationto dishonesty, those who were the most dishonesi. would
be the most benefited by the amendment He would rather
leave the evil—the oppre^sne taxation on the most uniorti nate
portions of the community—wheie it was, than to perpetuate it
by the adoption of thi& amendment, which he fnmly believed
would ha\ e that effect He was for lessening the burdens of the
unfortunat a upon v> hom this fee tax falN, but was opposed to
taking from the attorney and cleikt, iny portion of the amwunt
collected, to h*- carried to the National Treasury
Mr BERRIEN obtained the flooi and moved an adjourn
mem, winch motion wa decided in the negative by ayes 18,
noes 19
Mr B roae and proceeded to discuss the amendment aigu
mg that, if the rate of fees was too IngN ju&üce d^rn-mded that
it should be reduced But he conceived it to be hi^hlv unjust
and illiberal m the Government to permit a tax, by wav of lees,
tobe collected, and then, because it affords too great compen
sation to tho^e for the payment of wiio^e labor the tax wis au
thonzed, to canj what might be the excess into the National
Treasuiy
Iftheiateof fees gave too gttat compensation to the cleiks
and attorneys he cons 11 red it the dnt> of the Senate to turn
its attention to the iaw fixing that rate, and so aHei it, as to
es abíish such a rate as would give ample salary to th ¡=e
officers, but he wasoppooec1 to ib 'rao ing from them, for the
purpose of being caw led to the Nati nal Tiea*HU> any pu
tion of the amount which was the pioductof the labn r f those
officers He believe 1 sucha fee bill could be established as
would aflbrl a great compensa \&i to those officers m everv dis
trict in the Union He d.d not believe that the present law contem
plated a uniform bill if tees for the whole Union ami thought,
therefore, ihat it might be st al ered as to be made to suit each
partícula district, by idop'ii e sjch a ía e in each di met a 
would afbrdamp'e salaiy to t*in«e urkers, and notl 1112 more
He believed the mode cf lee «da 1 m cont mplated by this
amendment was an unjut-t o ¡e ail be trusted, there'oie, that
the amendment won d not be adi} ted

The question now being on 01 deling the amendments to the

Mr BUCHANAN ioae and said he had another amendment
to propose, which he considered was necesodiy to put himself

Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr Wood bub y J He could
not vote for the othei amendment, because it depnv ed the Gov
em iienl of a power which in no uwiired Government m the
woi id was denied—the power t > appoint ¡secret or special agents

"To the Hon George PoiNDEXTERand AlfredKELLEY,eeq
"It appears that, for a series of years, there have been heavy
losses and defalcations 111 the collection of the revenue at the
portof New York Itappears, also, that the number of offi-
cers engaged in the collection of the customs at that port has
been much augmented, and the expense incurred m the collec-
tion, has greatly increased, and it has been alleged and charged,
in a manner and under cucmnstances which require notice,
that there have been fiauds and connivance at frauds, and par
tiaiity md conupuon, among some of the peisons connected
with the collet tion of the customs, whereby the revenue hag
satfeLed lo&s, and the honest and fair traders have suffered in-

'* The President consideit. it his duty, under and by virtue of
the piovis on oi the Constitution which requires him to see
that the taws be faithfully executed, to irqmre into andascer
tain the best means w thin his pov*ei of correcting the evils
which have been found to ixist ¡n this branch of the Executive
administration, and also toirquire into the existence of such
abuses as are alleged, to the end that, if discovered to exist, they
also may be coirecttd
"For this pui pose he has appointed you a commission of ex
animation and inquiry, and wishes you to direct youi attention
to the following points

customs have gone into the hands of any of the collectors, or
other officers of the eustoms—which does not appear m the ae

it does not appear 111 the accounts—whether it is owing to a de
feet m the mode of keeping the books of the custom house, and
ot stating the accounts, or to the negligence or misconduct of
the accounting officers
"2d You will inquire and report whether the number of clerks
in the office of the col'ector or naval ofncei be greater or Jess
than the full and prompt peifoi manee of the clerical duties in
such office requires
"3d Whether frauds have been recently and habitually
practised by importéis of mei chandise, to the injury of the rev
enue, and, if so, whether it was owing to any defect in the ex-
jstmglaws, or to the connivance or negligence of any of the of-
ficers of the customs, and,if so, by whom
