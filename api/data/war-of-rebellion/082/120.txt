Senior Naval Officer, Sounds of North Carolina:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I have this moment received a communication from Colonel D. W. Wardrop, commanding at Roanoke Island, inclosing a communication from you relative to an improper traffic going on in the region of Columbia, in Hyde County. I am obliged to you for the information and shall take immediate measures to stop the trade. To accomplish [this] I have ordered the quartermaster's steamer Ella May, with two smooth brass 6-pounders aboard, to proceed to Roanoke Island and report to Colonel Wardrop, who I have directed to place on board a suitable number of gunners and sharpshooters, in command of a competent officer. He will then send them to the referred to with such orders as he may deem best to accomplish the purpose. Upon the return of the expedition Colonel Wardrop has been authorized to detain the Ella May at Roanoke Island for temporary service. He may with her be able to render you much assistance in communicating with the fleet in various parts of the Sounds. Colonel Wardrop also incloses a letter from you relative to the man R. Oberman. His case will be attended to, for I mean, with your kind co-operation, to put a stop to all this illegal traffic.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
