I am directed to invite your attention to the large number (1,145) of men reported as missing in your statement of casualties sent in yesterday. The commanding general presumes that but a portion of these men were taken prisoners, and that many of the stragglers must have joined their companies. He therefore desires that you will furnish, as soon as practicable, a revised statement of the casualties in your command during the operations in front of Petersburg, specifying the number of men supposed to have been taken prisoners.
