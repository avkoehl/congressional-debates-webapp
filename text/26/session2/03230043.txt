public land He did it at hi  own risk. He d d it
under the laws of the State where the lands, lay,
and though he purchased of the United S ates, he
could hold only under the State Congress had
passed no law lhat all who purchased 'he land of
the United States should have power to hold it
within the new States. It had, however, gone
further than thi« bill proposed to go It had not
only sold, but given land to foreignerb, and even to
those who were subjects of the Autocrat of RitS'-ii
and the King of France Tracts had been given
both to Polish and to French settlers, and the
States had formerly done the same thing He
would not dispute the power to sell to any one,
whe her to do so was politic or not, was a d ffe-
rent question It had been thought good policy to
give these lands to the Poles and the French
emigrants, but he greatly doubted this He did not
think it good policy to give privileges to foreigner ,
in preference to our own citizens The present
b 11 was a bill of privileges—it was a bill of boun-
ties to some classes of persons over others He
was not in favor of giving privileges and making
grants to foreigners, over the heads of our own ci-
t 2ens, in order to induce them to come and reside
among us Congress had had a magnificent do-
main confided to its care, not, indeed, to be ma-
naged in the niggardly spirit of a land holder, who
was determined to make the most of every foot of
the soil, but to be held a^ a great and saced trus',
for purposes both of finance and of patriotism To
view thp subject aright, gentlemen ought to look at
it in both these views They ous ht not, on the ont?
hand, to forget that the public lar ds were a great
financial trust for the benefit of the whoic Union,
nor, on tre other, that they were the means lo be
employed m building up a glonous empire m the
West Considered first in a financial point of
view, they were a prope ty nrt to be wantonly
wasted, or profligately dila, lda'ed As a trust
fund, held for the benefit of all the Stales, the land'
was to be husbanded with care They might be
made to dim nish the public burdens, and to ligh'en
the load of taxation, but whi e the Generil Gov; rn
ment was to reg.rd them in this l'gh', it must rt-
tncmber that it mi bt not, to secure the^e objects,
trample on the riehts of ih« inhabitants of the great
Wet, nor on ihe pAramount right of the whol •
people of the Ur ited States He wou'd nof was'e
the domain, but would administer it m such a man-
ner a* to afford an inviting outlet to that mass of
population which was leaving the Atlantic shnes
to seek a more ferli'e residence in the virgin soil of
the West
As to the financial question, the piemen! bill, by
allowing settlers to select the most fertile tracts and
advantageous point*, ceitamly would dimmish the
value of the residue which was to hi exposed at
public sale Lands thus «old at auction brought to
the Government, upon an averaee, something over
$1 25 Tüose who went m on the publ c domain
wou d fix upon spots not only good in themselves,
but commanding, to a greater or less degree, the
value of the lands in the vicinity, such, for exam-
ple, as spots of wood m the inidvt of a prairie,
valuable springs in a dry region, wat r-power
where water-power was scarce Such points as
these were certainly worth greatly over the mini
mum p-ice, yet the bill allowed a pre-emption
without restriction, know in; that the seis-mg and
occupancy of such favoiable situations vould be
the certain and necessary result The consequence
was inevitable, that ihe value of the rest of the
territory would and must be diminished Means
would of course be devised of speculating on these
advantages. They had been already put m prac-
tice Every kody who came from the West well
knew that this was and always would be done
Wealthy men would send individuals ~to settle on
the land, with an express view to buy up their im-
provements Nor was there any thing wrong in
this He had himself made such purchases, and
the settlers from w hom he bought immediate y went
on to make new settlements, and openly begged hrs
custom They were in the habit of seizing on a
commanding snuation, "o as to make the surround-
ing land of comparatively ro value without it, and
thus contrive to put money in the r pocket.
Estreme cases answered extreme case .   The
Pre eruption Law—Mr. Hubbard.
worthy Sena'or from Missouri on his left [VIr
Linn] had said that, if pre-emption and graduation
were refused, the public lands might be helj up
until tney should be worth $30 per acre. True,
this might happen, bu* then, on the other hand, the
lands mi¿ht be given away for nothing at all The
Senator said that, if thrown open, the lands would
bring more money than if held up, and yet lhat
they micH be held up until, instead cf bringing
$ 1 25, they would b mg J30 per acre Both posi-
tions certainly could not be true
There was no man ".ho rejoiced turre at tbx as
tomshmg growth of the West, or who wondered
more at the contemplation of it, than he did His
heart's most earnest desire had been gratified to
witness the population of some of the«e Slates
doubling l'self in e ght or ten years But what wa>
the practical effect of this whole state of thing-' II
it was our true policy to build up the West, to
fos er by every proper means this young and rising
emp re, was it not < qually our p licy *o cast an eye
toward the «eaboard, and to pre erve the old Sta es
of the Confediracy? And if 'o, what right hsd
our Wes'e'n brethren, ont of those S ates' own pa-
trimony, to offer <i bounty f >r the purpose of dram-
in  off their popula icn? What right had the Ge-
neral Government to draw eff the population and
resources of South Cirolma that the We-t m.ght
spring up like the palace of Aladdin, or rise like
an exhalation1 This bill offerei to all who would
leave the worn out foil of Virginia or the Carolina
a positive bounty. It held out inducements to ti e
young and enterprising to pour over the mountain ,
and build up an empire in the West, be ond even
th'«'apidity of Nature. Tne At'antic States weie
already drained Th~ lands, if South Carolina

But were not ihe inducements to em aration already
sufli ¡cully stroig without superadding the torce of
rewar 's and boui>ti?s? Yet the privilege proposed
by tin bill ias as much a boun y as if it had been
< ffered n cish He estirrattd it m diit point of
vi*w If th-" United States shoull sell laid m o-
der to give money, what mas it but a system of re

wlich weie *o be davastited ?nd drsmed Tne old
States had as much pioperty m the public lands as
tKe new, and yet it «as prrposed to take from the
revenue  hey would bring, and give it as a bounty
to those who shall go West The bill would take
money from htm to give it to his neighbor, to in-
duce him to leave Carol na and go into Arkansas
or Mitotan Th¡3 was not fair, it wa" unequal,
it was exclusive.
Whether the exis mg land system was in all re
spects correct or not, was a question on which he
shou d not enter Thus far, at lei^t, it had acted
regularly and v ell It had made Oh o It had
made Indiana It had made I hrcis. It had made
Missouri It was mak ng Michigan It was making
Arkansas It \v?s fast making the We,t the great
depository of p lit.cal power Ore census more
would make the old S ates but an appendage to the
new—a mere fringe upon the border of the West-
ern empire Was not this enough! Did Western
gentlemen ask for more? Would they still ins a
upon hasten is g the prrcss j et more by bills of
bounty and privilege? H  hoped not If the
United Slates title to the land was a grievance, it
was a grievance which the new States could not
remove No doubt it was held as a grievance that
tne Government should hold up the land at fl 25
Grantuig it, however, to be an evil it could not be
a very jteat one wrere there was so much lard of
ti e first rale quail íy Tnere miaht be borne evils
in the system, but let not the Senate, by one fell
swoop, tear up and rever e the whole.
It m ght be b-cause he was passm? 'he meridian
of life, but, from whatevercause, he crtamly found
a daily increasing tendency in h s mind to stop in
past experience, to abide by what had been tried

had worked well, and not, m the mere insolence of
Senate.
his cwn reason, for tearing up and overturning
what had long been decided by the wisdom of those
who had gone before htm He turned from mere
th orj.hovever fair and promising, to actual re-
sults—to the verdict time had given The proposed
plan held out magnificent results, but they were
results merely m prospect He preferred to stand
on what experience had proved, and was satisfied
with the results which proved the system, from
which they flowed, to be wise an(j beneficent.
As lo the distinction proposed in the amend-
ment of the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr. Crit-
tenden,] by restricting the pre emption privi-
lege to the settler whoi«e property does not ex-
ceed $500, I am not inclined to adopt it. lis object
is to confine thebenefitsof tbebiUtothe poor man,
but we are all poor In this country we all have to
win our way to forttm' by the sweat of our brow
The primeval curse rests upen America as upon
li.e rest of the world I am not disposed to legis-
late for the pour. In this free Republic we are all
equal before ihz law, and when we are dispensing
the bounties of the Government, I do not think we
hive any right to tegragate one class alone as the
cbjects of our beneficence If we do it in favor of
one class, we do it against another class, which is
ntteily abhorrent to the genius of all our institu-
tions. The men who subdue our Western forests
are a noble race, hardy, daring, full of ¡(enterprise
and courage I admire their character I rejoice
in their success; bull tl ink they have no claim to
exclusive legislation While I look at them I must
also have <ome regard to my own interests What
carries them to the West A bold and enterptis-
inj «pint And who is it 'bey 'eek to benefit
Me irinne Not at all Tfaey seek to benefit
the n>e ves smd they are light, but they are no
1 more entitled to the patron pa cf the Government
than I cm We both pursue our own ntercts,
th„ugh n different lines of exertion Our stimula-
ti >n 's to be found in the h gh rewards which this
country ho'd  out to every form of resolute tnter-
pn e If we en- p oy men t"> settle the public
land--, wt ought lo pay them, but if they go for
their ovn advantage, to thaf advantage they
must look ¿s the reward of their efforts. It,
indeed, we bavt m any case thrown special burdens
j upoi them, the case is altered It is siid we have

impart for rur protection, but wh"iem does their
situation in this respect d ffer from that wh ch has
m succession b en the early condition cf all who
settled tms country? Has not our wh>le wilder
ness been opened and settled under the gleam of
the tcmahauk12 Did not our fir&t set lers calculate
on danger when they penetrated th" Western
wild 3 They braved those dangers, and they hive
'bund their regard But it is said that if we ex-
pose them to Indian neighb rs, we are bound in
justice'o guard them from the danger we have
crea ej Admit n, and have we not guarded them?
Have we made no military provision for their de-
fence? When Black Hawk and his band invaded
the frontier, did we stard wtth our handsfolded
and suffer their settlements to be ravaged? No, we
sent them our Generals and our troops- We poured
oat without stmt the treasure and the blood of the
ram n, and it was but our duty I regard these
Western «ettlers a<-children of the same common
Government, as bro hers m our great and wide
family whom it is our pleasure and our pride to
cheri h and pro'ect We have sent regiment after
ipgiment, we have built fort after fort; and if we
have exposed them to danger, we have at least en-
deavored to shield them against it; not but what,
wn It I say this, I think that many gentlemen are

sent off the Indians from within the Siates.aid some
of these very settlers have got the richest of the

congregated their tribes upon our frontier; but how
are they situated'! On the one «íde are the ssttle-
ments of the whites, the very Stptes from which they
hate been expelled, full ot an armed and hardy
population, which is multiplying and becoming
more and more den e from day to day This is
