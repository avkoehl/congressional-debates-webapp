joiin It. BAY.
Mr, BENJAMIN, from the same committee,
reported a bill (H. R. No. 1953) granting a
pension to John R. Ray; which was read a
first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill was read at length. It directs the
Secretary of the Interior to place on the pen-
sion-roll, subject to the provisions and limita-
tions of the pension laws, the name of John K.
Ray, a resident of Caldwell county, Missouri,
who was wounded while serving in the-organ-
ization known as the six months' militia of
Missouri, and to pay him the pension of a pri-
vate from January 1, 1862.
Mr. ROSS. We ought not to grant this man
a pension, for he was in the Missouri militia,
and not in the service of the United States.
Mr. BENJAMIN. This is the Missouri home
guards, and the question of pensioning those
who were disabled or died in that service came
up at the last session of Congress. It was con-
sidered first iu committee, and then in the
House; and it was decided affirmatively in favor
of granting the pensions, alter the matter had
been up for some two or three weeks. The
facts are these: Missouri, in 1861, authorised
the organization of a military force called the
home guards. They were placed under the
command of United States officers ; they acted
with the regulars and with the volunteers, and
were commanded by officers in the United States
Army, and when so acting young Ray was.
wounded. Where they have been disabled or
killed pensions have been granted as in the
case of other troops. We have not gone so
far as to pension any of the local militia i\ here
they were acting independently under the com-
mand of their own officers, but when they were
placed in command of United States officers
and did duty as United States soldiers then
we have pensioned them by various special acts.
One word more. These home guards were
commanded by UnitedStates officers, and were
subsisted and paid by the United States; so
that they were in all respects except in name
on the same footing as United States troops.
Mr. ROSS. Was this man mustered into
the service of the United States?
Mr. BENJAMIN. They were never mus-
tered into the United States service.
Mr. McCORMICK. Were they not turned
over to the command of the United States
officers?
Mr. BENJAMIN. They were under offi-
cers in command of the department of Mis-
souri at the time.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. They were
in service at the same time I was, in the same
brigade, and did duty on the same picket line.
Mr. IIOLMAN. Wherein does this ease
differ from that of the forces organized 111
Indiana or Ohio to resist the advance of John
Morgan, except that the Missouri troops were
engaged a longer time? Neither were en-
listed troops ; and yet the committee reports
against the men engaged in repelling the Mor-
gan raid.
Mr. BENJAMIN. If the Indiana and Oh. -o
troops were engaged under the same circum-
stances as these, then there would be no dif-
ference. But I undertake to say the circum-
stances were different. These were volunteers
in the service for a specific term.
Mr. HOLMAN. How long?
Mr. BENJAMIN. Six months; and they
were olhcered, organized, clothed, drilled, fed,
and paid by the United States.
