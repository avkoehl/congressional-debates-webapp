market. Theirs is exactly the reverse, to
cheapen production so that they can have for-
eign markets and can undersell the rest of the
world. When everything we make here costs
twice as much to make as it does in England,
how can we go into the markets of the world
iu competition with her?
From 1815 to 1842 (when free trade began to
be inaugurated) the exports of England re-
mained almost stationary ; there was but little
increase. In 1849, at the time the free-trade
system went fully into operation, the value
of the exports of England was £63,590,000.
In 1867, after a period of eighteen years,
they rose £180,921,000, having for twenty
eight years before 1849 been nearly at a stand
still. In eighteen years after the change of
system they nearly trebled.
Not only did they increase their exports, but
they increased their imports in the same ratio,
and with them, of course, their shipping inter-
est, their ship-building, and the profits of the
carrying trade. The manufacturers of Eng-
land were not the only persons who took ad-
vantage of this great increase of exports; for
With enlarged exports and imports came neces-
sarily a demand for ships, and thus ship-build-
ers and carpenters got good employment.
Ships and freights were worth nothing without
seamen; thus a large body of good seamen were
produced and employed. And all these com-
bined gave birth to commission merchants,
draymep., carmen, &c.; to railroads, and inter-
nal channels of transportation.
In 1849 the tonnage of England was 3,096,-
342 tons, and iu 1867 it had increased to
5,493,208 tons, an increase of more than two
million tons in that time. I will read what an
English writer says on this subject:
" The mora libera] views of commercial policy,
adopted iu regard to the navigation laws, and advo-
cated generally by Mr. Huskisson and Sir Robert
Peel, and by many others of our legislators and
intelligent writers, prepared the public mind for
the abandonment of the system of protection by
which our foreign trade was hampered. When the
manufactures of Great Britain became superior and
cheaper than those of the continent it was absurd
to impose restrictions on the importation of goods
which could not compete with ours even in foreign
markets, and witb respect to those articles of taste
and luxury, in the production of which foreign
countries continued to surpass us, their prohibition
or restricted use, by the imposition of high duties,
had been shown by experience to be opposed to the
best interests of the country and prejudicial even to
the progress and improvement of the manufactures
which such protective duties were intended to encour-
age. Several modifications of the tariff of customs
duties had been made in the course of the century,
and in 1815 Sir Robert Peel brought forward his lib-
eral and comprehensive scheme, by which the sys-
tem of protection was virtually abandoned, and the
advantages of free trade were recognized. By that
measure the duties on four hundred and twenty dif-
ferent articles were either abolished or reduced, and
most of those that were continued were avowed to
be retained for the purposes of revenue and not of
protection.
" In the following year the same able statesman
introduced the bill for the repeal of the corn laws,
which passed in 1846. and on the 1st of Febru-
ary, 1849, that measure came into full operation.
Free trade in corn and in provisions, instead of be-
ing the ruin of the farmers, as apprehended, has
proved highly beneficial to them, and the agricul-
tural interest is now much more prosperous than it
was during the time of protection."
Not only that; but with this change of sys-
tem pauperism, which had been a great evil
in England, and which it was feared would in
progress of time destroy the country, was dimin-
ished. Of coarse whenever you afford a peo-
ple the opportunity to live cheaper there must
necessarily be less pauperism. Pauperism is
produced by several causes, but principally by
the high price of living. If the system of a
country is such as to make living high, it must
increase pauperism ; but wherever the oppo-
site policy is adopted, wherever the system of
making living cheaper and cheapening pro-
duction prevails, it tends to diminish pauper-
ism. That has been the effect of the free-
trade policy of Great Britain. On this point
let me read from Pashley's Pauperism and
Poor Laws:
" The great prosperity of nearly all classes i  Eng-
land since the repeal of the corn laws has been
accompanied by a considerable diminution since
1818 in the total money cost of pauperism."—Page 5.
The number of poor persons relieved on the 1st
of January in each of the years 1847,1848, and 1849,
was greater than the number so relieved on the first
of January, 1850."—Page S.
Now I wish to refer to a book, the authority
of which the Senator from Pennsylvania will
not deny, for it is written by Pennsylvania
protectionists, Daddow and Bannan's Coal,
Iron, and Oil, in which , speaking of the won-
derful progress of Great Britain, they say:
" In 1816, at the close of the French war, the debt
of Great Britain was $4,205,000,000, and her estimated
wealth £10,500,000,000. Since then the increase of
her wealth has been rapid, and may now be stated
at nearly $100,000,000,000.
" She has not only so vastly increased her wealth,
but her ability to produce has been proportionally
increased. In 1688 her population was less than six
millions, and the industrial or productive power of
these was limited to the able-bodied men and
women, boys and girls, who exerted only their brute
strength, with but little assistance from intelligence,
mechanical skill, or science. But in 1865 we find a
population of over thirty million, whose average
wealth is over three thousand dollars per head, and
whose productive ability is increased twenty times
by the aid of labor-saving machinery; that is, the
thirty million inhabitants of Great Britain, aided
by steam-power and mechanical skill, are equal to a
physical force of six hundred million able-bodied
men, or more productive power than is possessed by
the entire manual labor of the world."
That is testimony to the progress made
by the system now in force in Englaud, for
that progress has been more rapid since 1849
than it had been before.
I read now from Watt's Facts of the Cotton
Famine in England, page 41:
" Itis estimated that thirty million spindles in 1860
would turn off as much work as thity-seven millions
would have done in 1840, so that while the increase
in spindles has been seventy-six per cent., the in-
crease in production has been one hundred and nine-
teen per cent., and instead of these improvements
displacing operatives, as the prejudices ofthe people
led them to suppose they would do, the manufac-
turers have had from time to time to import thou-
sands of families from the agricultural districts for
the sake of their juvenile laborers; and wages,
instead of depreciating, have advanced between the
years 1844 and I860 from ten to twenty per eent.,
while the hours of labor have been materially
shortened."
Our tariff contains more articles of iron
alone upon which an impost is collected than
the whole list in the English tariff.
Our imports are in round numbers about
$550,000,000, and the revenue derived from
them under the present system is $220,000,000,
so that our tax upon imports is two fifths of
the value of the articles imported. Protec-
tion does not keep foreign articles from com-
ing here. The effect of the protection is to
increase the price of everything. It makes
ours a high market. Under protection the
price of articles is raised, and anybody that
has things elsewhere in the world to sell looks
abroad for the highest market. Men see that
here they can sell the articles they make at a
higher price than anywhere else, and notwith-
standing our high duties they still send us goods
simply because we have a high market. That
is illustrated by the fact that we continue to
import until our imports now exceed our ex-
ports $265,000,000. That $265,000,000 must
be paid by the sale of bonds abroad, so that
in this operation we transfer to Europe evi-
dences of debt for $265,000,000, the principal
of which we shall have some day to pay, and
the interest,we are now paying.
As an evidence of the great prosperity of
England, we have the fact that in the year
1871 Great Britain finished ten hundred and
twenty-two shi.ps with a tonnage of three hun-
dred and ninety-one thousand and fiftv-eight
tons. How many were made iu the United
States? I do not know, but I suppose not a
hundred, not the tenth part of the number
made iu Great Britain. She builds ships for
the whole world under her free-trade system.
We, under ourprotective system, neither build
nor sail them. We do not build -them for our-
selves, we do not build them for others. Our
ship-yards are idle and deserted. We tax the
articles that enter into the manufacture of
ships, and therefore we cannot make them
cheap. England does not do that; she admits
them free, and therefore she builds ships cheap.
Not only that, but the decline of our ship-
building has caused the loss of the carrying
trade. _ Our flag is hardly seen in our own har-
bors ; it is not seen in the harbors of the world.
The English flag is to he seen to-day in every
harbor and every sea of the whole earth. To
show our decline in this respect, I Bubmit the
following table of our freights, including im-
ports, exports, and reexports:

This shows you how rapid the decline of
our carrying trade has been, and how great has
been the increase of the British.
Now, to test the comparative merits of the
two systems, let me illustrate by comparing
Philadelphia, which is the best protected city
in the best protected State in the best pro-
tected country in the world, with the manu-
facturing cities of Great Britain. If Phila-
delphia, with all the advantages it possesses
of anew country, immigration, and protection,
increases less rapidly than the manufacturing
cities of Great Britain, what is the reason?
The reason must be because we have a system
which is less favorable to the growth of man-
ufacturing cities and the growth of manufac-
tures than that- country has. There can be no
other reason. The growth of these British
manufacturing cities is conclusive evidence
not only of the success of manufactures there,
but of the prosperity of that country, because
labor does not go where it is not in demand,
and where it does not get good wages. If
people have flocked from abroad or from other
parts of the British empire to Manchester,
there can be only one cause for it, and that is
their labor is in demand and is remunerative
there; and if we find that that manufacturing
city has increased in a most unprecedented
manner, it must be because enterprise was
successful there, and labor in demand and
profitable. Now let us see what the facts are.
Philadelphia, in 1860, had a population of
565,529, and in 1870 a population of 674,022,
an increase of about nineteen per cent, in ten
years in the principal manufacturing city of
the United States. How it is with European
cities? I will not select a single one to make
the comparison, but I will take the four prin-
cipal manufacturing cities of Great Britain,
Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham,and Sheffield.
Manchester iu 1851 had a population of
228,437, and it had increased in 1861 to
338,722, or an increase of nearly forty-eight
per cent. ; and from 1881 to 1871 it rose to
383,843, ah increase of only fourteen percent.
The small rate of increase during the latter
period was owing to the fact that our war had
inteivened, and there was a cotton famine in
England. Leeds in 1851 had a population of
172,170, in 1861,207,165, an increase of twenty
per cent., and in 1871, 259,201, an increase
of twenty-five per cent, over 1861. Birming-
ham in 1851 had a population of 232,841, and
in 1861, 296,070, an increase of twenty-eight
per cent; from 1861 to 1871 the population
