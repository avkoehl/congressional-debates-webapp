in the single instance of a soldier improperly jumping from the car under apprehension of danger, by which he lost his life, when, had he remained quiet, he would have been as safe as were his comrades of the same car.

After so many days of anxiety and suspense-a suspence and anxiety I know fully shared by yourself and many others-may I not congratulate upon the complete and entire success of a movement the like of which I think has neither its parallel in this eventful war, nor, indeed, in the history of warfare, the only similar movmeent being that of the transfer of the Twelfth and Thirteenth [Eleventh] Army Corps of 22,000 men, General Hooker commanding, from the Potomac to Chattanooga, 200 miles less in distance, and effected in the mildest autumn weather in about the same time, with days, if not weeks, of preparation, and in which case the route was distinctly understood before the movement commenced. The difference betweena movement under such circumstances and one under which the Twenty-third Army Corps has been transorted, with greatly multiplied dangers and difficulties atending it, are throughly understood by all familiar with winter navigation and land transportation.

The transfer of so large an army, with ample time and preparation, foir so great a distance, even in summer weather, would if itself be a marked event. But when it is understood that not beyond four or five day had elapsed after the movement was decided upon in Washington befor ethe embarkation of the troops had actually commenced upon the bank of the Tennessee, nearly 1,400 miles distant, and that within an average of eleven days from the time of its embarkation so large an army, with its artillery and animals, was quietly encamped upon the banks of the Potomac, and that the transfer has been made along rivers obstructed by fog and ice, and over mountains, during violent snow-storms, and amid the unusual severities of idwinter in a northern climate, with all the doubts, constant uncertainties, and changes herein mentioned as to routes and points of tranfer, at a period of the yet, too, whenm accidents upon railroads arising from the breaking of machinery or rails in ordinary transportation are of frequent occurrence, many of a serious and fatal character having occurred during this time on other roads, and when it is known that that ecomfort of the troops had been so carefullly provided for, and the police of the different roads so throughly organized that during the whole movemetn not the least injury of person or loss of property occurred, with the exception of the solider above alluded to, and that the condition of the troops is to-day in all respects as good for meeting the enemies of their country as itw as on the day of their departure from the banks of the Tennessee; unbder such circumstances, am I not justified in characterizing this movement as an event remarkable in design and successful in execution, the like of which has never before occurred, and as being most illustrative of the great physical advnacement and resources of our country, even in its present desolated and distracted condition, and showing its resistless power when harmonious and united?

I should be failing in justice not to record and call special attention to the means by which your orders have been so successfully executed. I refer to the managers of our ailroad and river transportation.

The earnest efforts of those controlling the different lines of railroads used in making this movement have ben most conspicious.

How many valuable officers and soldiers have been furnished to our army from this department of business is well known to yourself; a business commanding as it does a greater number in proportion than
