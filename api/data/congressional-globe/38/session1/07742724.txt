THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 3,
To demonstrate more particularly the immedi-
ate, effect of the war on the mercantile interests of
my constituents I will state the fact that in 1861,
after tfee rebellion began,nine hundred and thirteen
mercantile houses in New York became insolv-
ent, whose liabilities in no case were under
$50,000, and in some cases amounted to several
millions. Out of two hundred and fifty-six solv-
ent dry-goods houses in New York at the be-
ginning of the war only sixteen remained at the
end of the same year.
I propose now to call the attention of the House
to a to\v more statistical facts of importance in
their bearings on this subject, I derive my in-
formation from one of the best and most reliable
authorities on this subject.* These statistics re-
fer exclusively to failures of at least $5,000 each,
and are as follows:

lhe city of New York, from its commercial
character and the extent of its business, is al-
ways, in every monetary crisis, the largest suf-
ferer. No accurate statement of the insolvencies
of last year has come under my notice, but the
amount of their liabilities is computed to be about
$50,000,000. I think it will be readily perceived
by thu House that the enormoua aggregate of in-
debtedness can never be relieved except by means
of a general law including the various States. In
the absence of such an act the energies of a large .
portion of the peopieare crushed. There are prob- i
ably twenty or thirty thousand individuals in lliis :
country who are now unable to extricate them- ;
selvesfromtheevilsof insolvency. If they could !

assets they would again become useful members
of the commercial community.
I trust that the House will pass this bill. The
subject has been fully discussed before Congress
and in the country at different periods, and such
a measure as is now proposed has, with scarcely
any exception, been universally approved by the
leading organs of public opinion throughout all
parts of tlie United States.
During the last Congress no less than from
thirty to forty thousand persons petitioned for the
passage of a bankrupt law. I am satisfied that
its enactment will benefit creditors as well as
debtors; for the very moment that the avenue to
escape is opened men in failing circumstances will
extricate themselves from their embarrassments
by surrendering their, property for the benefit of
their creditors, and* thus the creditor, instead of
being paid as at present a small percentage of his
debt, or frequently none at all, will receive a much
larger dividend, as the necessary and direct tend-
ency of the proposed law is to cut ofF the sys-
tem of preferential assignments yet permitted by
law but prejudicial to the interest of creditors in
general and frequently adopted by debtors, be-
cause no other means of escape are open to them.
It has been urged as an objection to a general
and permanent law of bankruptcy thatunderthe
experimental and temporary law of 1841 only a
small percentage of dividends was paid to the cred-
itors. To arrive at a justconclusiononthispoint
it is necessary to remember that for a long period
before the passage of that law, including the dis-
astrous year of wide-spread insolvency, 1836-37,
no national remedy existed for the roliefof debtors.
In the mean time, for the purpose of maintaining
their families, insolvents, having no legal means
of restoration to an honorable position were nat-
urally but too frequently induced or driven to re-
sort to indirect methods of concealing some por-
tions of their property which had thus become
gradually exhausted, so that when the law was
passed there were few asst-ts. A permanent law
tends to product' a contrary reault, and to prevent
the waKte of asguts, both by its compulsory clauses
and by opening out avenu^j of future and hopeful
employment to every debtor who pusses through
the ordeal with an unblemished reputation.
1 regard it as a stigma on the age and country
thai, after we have abolished imprisonment for
debt, and done so much toward enlarging ilie priv-
ileges and rights of debtors, we should not have
a bankiupt law.
It is often said that if a man in failing eircum-
Maneea wilt give up his property his creditors
will release him; but practically it is well known
that there is seldom a case in which there is not
some creditor who will insist on having his pound
of flesh. If nine tenths of a man's creditors are
willing to release him on the surrenderof his prop-
erty, the other one tenth should be compelled to
acquiesce and not force the debtor to pay them
a hundred cents on the dollar, to the mjui y of the
more libeial creditors, and at the risk of forcing
the debtor to the adoption of a preferential assign-
ment, or some other arrangement equally niju-
lious to the general interests of hisjust creditors.
Every member of this House is, or should be,
familiar with those principles of legislation which
arc to be considered m reference to a bankrupt
law, an enactment demanded alike on the grounds
of expediency, humanity, and justice. The
United States alone, among all commercial na-
tions, refuse this measuie of relief to the honest
but unfortunate debtor and at the same time per-
mit m its stead a system of preferential assign-
ments, unjust to the creditor and demoralizing to
the public. I advocate no new and untried theo-
ry, Legislation which has existed for several
centuries in England, France, and the other lead-
ing nations of Europe, where it has been found
by experience to attain the object for which it was
enacted, compelling the just treatmentofcreditors
and aftordmg relief to honest and unfoitunate
debtors, is worthy of our most earnest and re-
spectful consideration. It is far more needed in
this country, where monetary fluctuations are fre-
quent, unforeseen, and violent, than in the Old
World, where the changes of trade are less com-
mon and embarrassing, ltis in especial accord-'
ance with the spirit of our institutions and ofour
people, who desire the protection of the weak,
and that none shall be hopelessly oppressed. In
all other respects our laws are lenient to the
debtor. But let no one regard this side of the sub-
ject alone.
The interests of the creditor are also to be con-
sidered. It is proposed to render the estate of the
debtor available in payment of his debts before it
has been dissipated by bad management or delay,
or concealed by fraudulent contrivances. The
creditor, as soon as due investigation, just to all
parties concerned, can be had, is to receive his
share of the bankrupt's estate; and if there has
been no proiligacy, no culpable carelessness, nor
any attempt at fraud on the part of the debtor, he
is set free once more to resume his accustomed
labors for the benefit of his family and society.
This course, while it is more profitable to the
creditor and more humane to the debtor than the
customs already prevailing, tends also to create
and maintain a higher standard of mercantile in-
tegrity and honor—a possession of inestimable
value to the nation.
The number of debtors who became insolvent
in the northern States in 1861, the first year of
the war, was, as I have already stated, nearly
six thousand, (5,935,) more than double the num-
ber of the same class in each of the previous years.
These people were the victims of casualties which
neither they nor the statesmen and Government
of our country were able to foresee. At other
times the sudden contraction of paper money and
banking facilities, after a long period of expansion
and easy credit, has produced unmerited calami-
ties like those by which merchants and others
dependent upon the southern trade were over-
whelmed in that truly calamitous year. It is our
duty to provide for these people a ready and
legitimate method of extrication from their diffi-
culties. They have been left—the victims of the
war—wounded and disabled on the field of com-
merce.
I am satisfied that no law which it is in the
power of Congress to pass will be more accept-
able to the people, or more beneficial to the coun-
try, than the one now under consideration. I
therefore hope it will be promptly passed. I
now move the previous question.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. 1 hope the gen-
tleman will not insist on his demand for the pre-
vious question at this time. I am very desirous
of supporting this bill, but I have some amend-
ments which I desire to offer, and which seem to
me to be vital to the bill.
Mr. WARD. I am acting under instructions,
and do not feel at liberty to withdraw the demand
for the previous question.
Mr. GARFIELD. I hope the demand for the
previous question will be voted down.
Mr. JENCICES. I desire to say to the gentle-
man from New York that I have a few verbal
amendments I wish to offer to the bill.
Mr. WARD. I will yield to the gentleman
from Rhode Island, who introduced the bill, of
course. 1 withdraw the demand for the previous
question and surrender the floor to him.
Mr. JENCK.ES. I move on page 16, line
forty-five, to insert after the word 41 papers" the
woids "relating to the property of the debtor."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. JENCRES. On page 56, line thirteen, I
move to strike out the word "his" before the
word " property" and to insert in place of it the
word " whose."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. JENCKES. In the thirty-seventh line I
move to insert before the word " seized" the
words " has been."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. JENCKES. I should now like to hear the
amendments the gentleman from Wisconsin has
to propose.
Mr. GARFIELD. Will the gentleman yield
to me ?
Mr. JENCKES. I will.
Mr. GARFIELD. 1 desire only to say that I
agree with the gentleman from New York that
tins bill is one of the most important that has
been brought before the House, except those di-
rectly connected with the prosecution of the war;
but I am surprised that gentlemen should present
n bill of this magnitude, a bill of seventy-four
printed pages, a bill more sweeping in its char-
acter than any that has been introduced into this
House, a bill intended to be permanent in its
operations, to continue for all time, affecting the
