removed from Fort McHenry early in December last. His imprisonment (which has now reached almost a year in duration), from his own account and that of others and for the last three months from my own peroneal knowledge, has been conducted with the most singular and uncalled for cruelty. The fact is it has been my opinion and is now that such treatment could not be continued without either costing him his reason or his life. In regard to the cause and circumstances of his capture I beg leave to refer you to Governor Letcher, of this State, whom I believe to be aware of the causes which led to his arrest.

The United States Government hold him charged with piracy and treason for the seizure of the steamer Saint Nicholas, yet at the time of his capture he held a commission as colonel in the Confederate service. I would suggest that an officer holding the same rank in the U. S. Army be selected from amongst our prisoners and be held for him individually and information sent to the United States Government that this particular officer will never be given up unless Colonel Zarvona be exchanged according to his rank. He is a member of one of the oldest, most respectable and at one time most influential families in Maryland, as I've been informed. His relatives are people I understand of considerable property and have contributed as liberally as has been in their power to the cause of Southern independence, while his only two brothers are at present in our army. It is thought that our Government has acted with the most unmerited indifference toward him.

I do not propose that the person who may be selected as a hostage for him should be treated in a personally retaliatory manner, for I think that such na course would not only be unproductive of any desired results but would be derogatory to the honor of a Christian nation in a civilized and enlightened age. Three months ago ge was removed from the casemate which he occupied with myself and several others to the guard-room and placed in solitary confinement in one of the cells. There he was denied all reading matter or writing material of any description whatever. He was allowed no communication whatever with any one inside of the fort, his failures excepted, and this has been continued up to the time that I left Fort Lafayette. Some time before I was released he was taken from the guard-room cell and placed in a casemate by himself, but after making an attempt to escape one tempestuous night by springing from the wall into the raging tide, although not knowing how to swim, he was not allowed to leave the room under any circumstances, and a sergeant (selected I verily believe on account of his known harsh demeanor) was confined in the room with him night and day armed with a loaded musket. This sergeant was allowed to leave the room during meal times only, and at such intervals three privates replaced him. these last details I obtained from the testimony of my fellow-prisoners, who became acquainted with the facts from their own observation and hearsay from soldiers in the garrison. *

I have felt myself called upon by Christian feelings of humanity to make the above statement and hope you will excuse my trespassing so long upon your valuable time. In regard to my own case I can but think that upon investigation and reconsideration of the matter you will be of the opinion that I can be regarded in no other light than that of prisoner of war. I was a member of a militia company it is true, but that company was commanded by a West Point officer and held together by a published proclamation of the Governor of the State as holding an
