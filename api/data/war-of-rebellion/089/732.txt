HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 28, 1864.

Major SEPTIMUS CARNCROSS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that three shots were fired yesterday from a battery to the left of the mine, which accounts in part for the work done at that point lately. This battery enfilades our picket-line. Small working parties have been observed on the works west of the rebel Fort Mahone. Seventeen rounds of ammunition expended on them; fifty-nine rounds from Cooper's mortars on working parties to the right and left of the Crater, and ninety rounds from Battery Numbers 20 in reply to shells from the enemy's mortars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 28, 1864.

Lieutenant THEODORE HUYSMAN,

Commanding Batteries C and I, Fifth U. S. Artillery:

LIEUTENANT: The major commanding instructs me to say that he directs you to withdraw your battery at once from its present position and to park it in the field where the quartermaster of this brigade now has his train, which is in rear of these headquarters a short distance. He directs that you break camp and have your command in readiness to move at daylight at a moment's notice. The carriages can be heavily packed with grain, as the movement is only a short distance to the left to relieve the Ninth Corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. D. EDDY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain J. HENRY SLEEPER,

Commanding Tenth Massachusetts Battery:

CAPTAIN: The major commanding instructs me to say that he directs you to break camp and have your battery in readiness to move at a moment's notice at daylight of the 29th, but not to move the pieces out of the forts. The movement will be to the left for the purpose of relieving the Ninth Corps, and the carriages can be heavily loaded with grain if necessary. If you have not horses enough to move your battery the battery wagon and forage may be left behind, under charge of an officer, who can bring them up as soon as he obtains the horses in the morning, which Captain Fisher, assistant quartermaster, has ready for issue.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. D. EDDY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
