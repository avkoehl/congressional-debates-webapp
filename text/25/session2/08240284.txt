heard of, and would undoubtedly be found as im-
practicable as it was novel and without a precedent
Bat the reports of the officer* of the Government
the Secretaries etc. were too long, said the mem-
ber Now sir, was the like of this objection ever
beiore known or heard of? Certainly not in this
House Theie could not be found any record of
such a one in the whole annals of the legislation
ot this country "What did it amount to'* Why,
this House, by a resolution, calls on one ol the'
officers of the departments for information on
some particular subject the officer of the Govern-
ment complies reports the information required
to the House, in obedience to the call, and imme-
diately objections are made to the report, not for
its inaccuracy or defectiveness, but because it con-
tains too much of the fact  called for, it is too long,
the author ot the call did not want to hear so much
of it Now this was to his mind the most extra-
ordinary step that had ever yet been taken by the
most reckless of those who had been urged on by
the wildest infunation of party prejudice Was
it the character of this House—had it ever been—
to le-stncl the reports of public officers? Would it
not be exercising an inquisitorial censorship, known
only to the despotisms of the old world, whose very
existence depended on the most limited and restricted
statement ot facts to go before the public eje
It was one of the veriest appendages ot tyranny to
bolstei up the despotisms ot the most oppressive
Governments of the world The whole idea was
not lcs new to him than it was revolting to every
principle of liberty, and repugnant to the investi-
gation of truth It \i as worse than calling; a wit-
ness into court, and then telling him how much
truth he should swear to in the evidence he was
about to give
But the whole subject was too monstrous to pro-
secute further The character of such a proposi-
tion was too near self-evident to require further
comment or exposuie
One word more as to the "Demoscratia," the
control of the people, or the Democracy ot the coun-
try , a name which had become so offensive, and
productive of the sneers of that member, and (he
party to which he belorged, in that Houve The
fickleness of the Democracy had been proverbial
from the earliest history of the political world, and
tnough the mov honest had ever beefi the most sub-
ject to perpetual change and abuses, no party has
evil b enso subject to every species of abuse and
imposition There had scarcely been an instance
in its historj, where it had ever been overthrown or
defeated, that it had not been done by the desertion
and treason of professing friends Scan ely a year
had passed within the history of this Government,
that did not witness striking instances of some pro-
minent members speeding, and attempting to be-
tiay the interests of that party into the hands of its
bitteiest enemies No body wa« ever more replete
with instances of this kind, than had been the Con-
gress of the United States foi the last six or eight
j^irs
The history of the Government did not record as
many instances ot desertions and betrayers of that
parly as had taken place here in the same length
of time At every new election that party had
3ent members here, who no sooner arrived than
they appeared to place fhemsslves in the maiket,
to be bid for or won over by their more wily oppo-
nents It was one of the curses with which that
party had ev er been afflicted Men seemed nowa-
days to seek the confidence of the Democratic peo-
ple but with the most wilful intent to betray them
The eye of eveiy fuend of Democracy and a tree
Government should be turned immediately to the
correction ot an evil that threatened so imminently
to sap the foundation of a party who ware the
upho'ders of the only free Government on earth~-a
party «hose great object had ever been to secure
and give efficacy to the unbiassed control of a
majority ot the great body of the freemen of this
country—and guard them against the insidious ap-
pioach and al'urements of ansocracy, in whatever
delasive form or shape its interest might prompt it
to assume
It was a most notorious fact too, though not at
all unnatuial, that these deserters from the people's
party, m attempting to betray Uje Democracy, had
always become their most furious enemies imme-
diately after their pretended conversion It then
became their interest to justify themselves with the
people whom they had betiayed at home, to see or
pretend to see a thousand corruptions and mol-proc-
tices in the party that they had deserted, that had
hitherto escaped the most discerning of the greatest
and most talented of all the most aged, experienced,
and distinguished men, by whom that paity had
been opposed foi so many years
Yes, sir, no sooner do they desert that party and
become converts to the non-laboring and non-pro-
ductive interests, than they become purified and il-
luminated, and discover innumerable corruptions,
which a long life heretofore, in the ranks of that
party, had not enabled them to get even a glimpse
of, and this now had become ol every day's occur-
rence Sir, I have said this was natural, it always
would be so, it was done to cover the disgrace of
their treachery, and to justify it in the eyes of those
whose mteiesis and honoi they had betrayed* It
was time that the sense of the Democracy and the
people should be aroused to this munstrous and
preposterous conduct of their Representatives here
Such men had caused much of that party rancor
and malignance which had for so many years dis-
turbed our country, and kept up «ontinually the
bitterest animosity amongst the people in every
section of the nation, and which made every Go-
vernment, and every Administration, that depend-
ed upon such, subject to continual fluctuations,
changes, and convulsions But he would pursue
that subject no further, as being impertinent some-
what to the occasion, to which he had been led by
the course of the extraordinary remaiks made by
the member from New Jersey.
One nord more to that member, and I shall have
done, to whom I h ould say, the many bittei, petty
items (hat have so much engrossed his magnificent
attention, and furnished such alruitful theme for the
venting of malice against those whom he can never
reach, could have all been remedied with the great-
est case, by simply calling the attention of the ap-
propriate committees to these subjects, and that on
Accounts partícula!lj, that have the most of
these subjects especially under their charge,
aithei by instructions to those committees or
ilherwise, to examine thsrn and report the facts,
or apply whatever remedy which might, m then
wisdom or ¡hat of the House, appear best Sir,
this was ih  true practical mode of getting at the
subject, if gentlemen were sincere m their profes-
sions in favor of ¡eduction and reform Let them
pursue such a course, and he was ready to go with
them, and they would be sustained by the Demo-
cracy of that House, but ibis they did not wish, and
preierred making general, indefinite charges foi
electioneering purposes, and spurning every specific
investigation, that could terminad only in any prac-
tical benefit to the people
As to the character ot the assaults that have
been made upon the distinguished individuals, he
would be permitted to say, what he in the utmost
sincerity of his heart regretted to say, from his
earliest associations, that New Jersey, one of
these United States, m the classic language that
the member had used towards a distinguish! d indi-
vidual of another body, "slooi solitary and alone,"
in having sent to the Congiess of the American
people, the first two representatives, (and they were
as yet alone,) so remarkable for their decency, cour-
tesy, good breeding, and classic learning, as to have
pronounced in their places vulgarly—one in the Se-
nate, that the President elected by the American
people, a man who had literally filled the measure
of his country's honor, worn down in the
service of that country, and grown grey in
the arduous discharge of the duties thereof, "a
ruthless liar and scoundrd," 01 words to hat effect,
and the other here m his place, in the presence oí
the American people, had just declared, in the filthy
linguage of the kennel presses of his party, that the
Vice President of your country, elevated to the
eminent station he now occupies, with so much cre-
dit to himself. nd satisfaction to the public, by the
great Democracy of this nation, had certain "affini-
ties to darkies," or a negro language, <ir, that is
alike insulting to this House, to the nation, and to
the whole  Democracy of this country.   Under
Senate.
such circumstances, sir,were Í but an humble citizen
of that Siate which had the distinguished honor of
having sent such distinguished representatives to
this body, and were tohjl that they had been the>first
and only two that had so far forgot what was doe
to their stations, and to the moral sense of thus
nation, as to have used such epithets in their place*
here towards so high and meritorious public ser-
vants of their country, my face would crimson
with shame and confusion at the mention of the
name of my State
RESURRECTION NOTES.
REMARKS OF MR. NILES,
Oi Connecticut.
In Senate, Thursday, rfpnl 19,1838—Upon the bill
to prevent ihe issuing and circulation of the bills,
notes and secundes of corporations created by
Congress vvhich have expired.
Mr. NILES said he did not rise to go into any
general discussion of the subject before the Senate,
but to notice a remark of the Senator from Ver-
mont, [Mi. PatNTiss,] and to submit very briefly
the views he took ot the power of Congress to
pass this bill. The Senator from Vermont has
made a statement of the facts m regard to the
putting off, and circulating the notes of the late
Bank of the United States, he says they are issued
by the officers of the Pennsylvania Bank of the
United Slates at their counter, m the same manner
that they are put off by other banks, that the
officers do not act or pretend to act as the trustees
or agents of ths late Bank of the United, Scates,
but as officers of the present bank, that there is no
giound therefore to charge them with a breach of
trust, or an abuse of the authority of the United
States, and then asks how this Government can
take cognizance of their acts. In xepVy to this,
sir, I have only to say, that it is not necessary to
consider the case stated, or to decide upon it. Jt
is not a case that comes within the provisions of
the bill before us The remarks of the Senator
are not against the bill, they have nothing to do
with it, they only go to show that a case which
exists, or which he supposes to ext?t, 4oes not
come within the provisions of the act we propose
to pass Such considerations are of no importance,
unless it is to show that the law is not broad
enough to reach the evil. If the Senator meaas
that abuses may prevail m relation to the Botes of
the late Bank of the United Stales, which the bilí,
should it become a law, would not reach, I shall not
diffei with him Does ihe gentleman fear that the
bill will not reach Mr Biddle? that he may be able
to evade ití Mr. N had himself feaia that such
might be the case, and was inclined to believe that
it ought to have been more comprehensive m its
scope That, however, is not the question which,
has been raised, as the objection is, that the bill
goes beyond ths proper limits of our potter. The
remarks of the Senator from Vermont would be
more suitable before a judicial tribunal, as they
are rather calculated to show that the conduct of
the officeis of the present Bank of the United
States, as he understands it, will not come within,
the provisions of the act, than to prove that Con-
gress has no power to pass it. The Senator States
a case clearly not embraced by the bill, and then
attempts to prove that Congress has no jurisdiction
over such case This is the way gentlemen reason,
and endeavor to prove that we have no power to
pass this bill, if they can state cases which are
beyond our power, that w 11 not prove that those
which are within the pun tew of the bill, are not
subject to our jurisdiction
"Ihe question regarding the power of Congress
cannot pioperly be considered with reference
to any particular case, real or suppositious,
but by lefeience to the provisions ot the bill.
We must see who, and what acts, it is that
we propose to punish, by pepal enactments,
before the question oí our jurisdiction caa^be, .fairly
raised On whom is this bültyi operate? JUs noion
those who may haye in their possession tlie^ pills or
notes of the late Bank of t&e JTnite^JS^ttw. «or
even on those. v/tto maj hajra the propérí/rp/ Sfsete
