PETERSBURG, April 5, 1865.

General WEITZEL,

Richmond:

The order to send a brigade to City Point received. One starts at once by railroad. This seems to clear up in a measure the doubt General Warren has been under respecting the intention of the lieutenant-general as to the commander of this place, whether, himself or myself. He thinks the Army of the James is to occupy this line.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, April 5, 1865.

Major-General HARTSUFF,

Petersburg:

The order directing you to send a brigade of your command to City Point is hereby countermanded.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

NOTTOWAY COURT-HOUSE, April 5, 1865.

Major-General WARREN:

Since the making of General Meade's order assigning you, General Ord has been directed to relieve all the Army of the Potomac, remaining at City Point, Petersburg, and on the South Side Railroad, to Sutherland's Station. As General Hartsuff is your senior you will turn over to him the command of those places and await further orders from the lieutenant-general commanding.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

[Indorsement.]

APRIL 5, 1865-5 p.m.

General HARTSUFF:

I send you a copy of an order just received by me, and now regularly relinquish all command over Petersburg and City Point as soon as you relieve the troops under General Benham at the latter place.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers

PETERSBURG, April 5, 1865.

General BENHAM:

I have received orders to be relieved of the command of Petersburg and City Point by the troops of General Hartsuff. He is sending troops to relieve yours this afternoon. You will await further orders at City Point, as I am momentarily expecting instructions myself.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
