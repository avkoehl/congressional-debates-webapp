Mr. GUSHING resumed and concluded his rc-
marfc, on the subject generally, and m favor of his
motion to commit, with certain instructions
Mr HOWARD addressed the House foi some

importance, and, for one,, was not deposed that
the action of the House should be predicated upon
the limited and contracted instructions to the com-
mittee prepared by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr Cusnac ) He v ould therefore with
a view of dialing out more important and extend-
ed information, moved to strike out all after the
word "instructions," and insert the following in
lieu thereof
"Also, to inquire into the extent of the country
c'aimed by the United States west of the Rock}
Mountains, and on the northwest coast on the Pa-
cific ocean, the titles under which it is claimed,

the extent of the sea coast, and the number and
description of its haibors, the nature of the climate,
soil, pioductions, and trade, and, also, whether it
is expedient to establish a Territorial Government,
or one or more military posts as protection for the
same, or any part thereof, and what will be the ex-
pense necessary to establish the same, and the an-
nual expense for its support, what fortifications
and ships will be required for said Territory, and
what number of soldiers and sailors will be neces-
s vi y foi its protection, both in time of peace and in
c 1st el wai wi h any for°ign power, and that the

Mi CUSHING said he did not object to the
amendment of the gentleman iiom South Caroh-
ni, hut thought that the object could be accom-
pli hed, if he «ould move it as an addition to
Mi C\ and then he would be willing to accept it
as i modification

gestion, the question was taken upon the adoption

and the eitire expenses of such removal to be
defrayed out ot the money tobe paid by the TT ntcd
Slates, as hereinafter provided." A« has been 1 e
fore obser/ed, the Government of the United alare0
could not agree to this act without the eons_ it ot
