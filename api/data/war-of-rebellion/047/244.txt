SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, Numbers 262. Charleston, July 29, 1863.

Although all the troops on James Island are under one common commander, the post at Fort Johnson, during the present emergency, will receive such orders as may be deemed necessary directly from these headquarters, and no troops, except in case of urgent need, will be drawn from that post for the interior of the island without the direction of these headquarters. The weekly returns will be forwarded through the headquarters of the First Sub-Division. The senior officer at Fort Johnson will bee, in all cases, the post commander.
