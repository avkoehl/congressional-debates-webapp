Major-General SCHOFIELD:

A deserter who has just come in has been qeustiond very closely by me, and I believe the statement he makes, which is as follows: Just after the attack on our left on the moirning of the 8th, a portion of Hood's old army, under D. H. Hill, arrived on the ground. Bragg is in command, and yesterday morning he addressed Hoke's division, informing them that they now had the Yankees running and they must keep them at it. This deserter crossed the river on the pontoon bridge, which is a few miles below Kinston, and he was with Hoke's division, which marched down the neuse road yesterday some two or three miles, when they went back again. Bragg tells his men that he is going to capture this army and then go to New Berne. It is my belief that he will not have, with Hill's men, ore than 15,000, but that a determined effort is to be made to defeat this force. I send this to you direct, as the signal station is at my camp. I shall send the same information to General Cox.

Very respectfully, yours,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

While I was very much occupied yesterday I heard of the pontoon bridge over the Neuse, and I directed my adjutant-general to notify the senior naval officer at New Berne of this. I merely desired to give him information, and did not intend either to direct or advise any movement against it. In these times much has to be left to staff officers, and blunder was made here.

General COX,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I desired to know if the Neuse road was clear from New Berne to this point on my right. I directed Colonel Stewart, at New Berne, to get this information for me by sending a small party through to me. The cavalry of his troop were sent from Fort Anderson, opposite New Berne. They report the road blockaded this side of Core Creek. If the men are not needed here they can be returned to their post. Shall I send them back?

Very respectfully, yours,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
