Colonel Ilsley had shown the picket officers of the Second Division the written division instructions when he went on duty as division officer of the day. The officer whom I deem most culpable in neglect of duty is Captain Shockey, Twenty-second Iowa; and next, I would mention First Lieutenant Leland, One hundred and seventy-sixth New York.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
