Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 2nd day of March, 1865:

Statement of Richard Roe, formerly member of Robinson's battery.

Left Mobile three weeks ago via Meridian, Jackson, and line of New Orleans and Jackson Railroad to Pass Manchac and New Orleans. French's division of Hood's army is at Mobile, about 4,000. Two brigades of Mississippi troops (infantry) are at Meridian. Chalmers' old brigade, now commanded by General Sharp, small. Walthall's brigade, now commanded by General Brantly, exact number unknown. This Louisiana Cavalry is around Lake Pontchartrain in quest of deserters. Two large flats, or launches, of capacity to carry 100 men each, have been lately transported to or near the Mississippi River. Heard there were two more, six oars on a side. First Louisiana Heavy Artillery are to man and works them. Think they were taken to Pearl River and then to Rodney, where they have been ferrying across the river. A small garrison only at Jackson, Miss. One brigade of Forrest's cavalry was near them, just over Pearl River, en route for some point unknown. Stewart's and Cheatham's corps of Hood's army have gone to Branchville, S. C. Was told by a railroad agent that transportation for 20,000 men, Hood's late command, was furnished from Tupelo to Meridian. There is said to be a camp of instructions for colored soldiers on the Alabama River. The gun-boats Huntsville and Tuscaloosa, of four guns each, are both heavily plated with railroad iron. An estimated force of 15,000 men, it is thought, can be concentrated in Mobile in case of necessity. Great preparations have been made there to me the Union troops.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. M. EATON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer, Mil. Div. of West Mississippi.
