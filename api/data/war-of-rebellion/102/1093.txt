INDIANOLA, July 19, 1865.

Major F. W. EMERY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Texas:

MAJOR: I have the honor to inform You that the wharf at Lavaca is reported repaired to the end of first T-head and ready to receive vessels drawing not over six feet. There is no material for the Indianola wharf, and it probably will not be ready for five or six weeks. Lavaca is about five miles nearer Green Lake than Indianola. I therefore recommend that for the present all men and stores going to Green Lake or Victoria be landed at Lavaca.

With great respect, Your obedient servant,

JOHN C. PALFREY,

Lieutenant Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Texas.
