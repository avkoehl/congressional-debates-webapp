RICHMOND, VA., December 3, 1862.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General Pemberton has fallen back from his positions by advance of very superior force of the enemy. General Holmes has been peremptorily ordered to re-enforce him, but his troops may arrive too late. The President urges on you the importance of sending a sufficient force from General Bragg's command to the aid of General Pemberton.
