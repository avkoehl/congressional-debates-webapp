HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,September 7, 1864.

Captain W. P. WILSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: In reply to communication* of Major-General Humphreys, chief of staff received at 1.15 a. m., I have the Honor to report that my picket-line is in front of the main line; that the front line from Ames' battery to the Jerusalem plank road is considered the main and only line. The troops withdrawn from there were placed in reserve for the purpose of being moved anywhere that may be necessary. If the chief of artillery of the Second Corps had reported to my headquarters in accordance with the instructions of major-general commanding the corps, the placing of the troops would have been explained to him and would have obviated his report to the chief of artillery of the Army of the Potomac.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. MOTT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
