THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 23,
the testimony in the contested-election case from
the Territory of Nebraska.
It was so ordered.
VISITING MILITARY.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I hold inmy hand
a resolution which present circumstances induce
me to offer, and to which, I presume, when the
House has heard it read, there will not be a soli-
tary exception. It is of a complimentary nature
to the New York regiment which came here on
the invitation of the congressional committee.
The Clerk read the resolution as follows:
Resolved, Tliat the Doorkeeper bo instructed to provide
a place in tile gallery fur those of the Seventh regiment of
New York, who, having visited Washington upon the in-
vitation of tile committee appointed by Congress to super-
intend tiie inauguration of the Washington equestrian
statue, nrc desiious of witnessing the proceedings of the
House.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I will modify the
resolution so as to include all other regiments or
companies froip a distance.
The resolution as modified was agreed to.
COMMUNICATIONS REFERRED.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask that certain commu-
nications from the Secretary of State to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means may be printed, and
referred to the Committee of Ways and Means.
It was so ordered.
ELECTION OF PRINTER.
The SPEAKER stated the business in order to
be the election of a Printer.
The tollers (Messrs. Pettit, Qxakles, and
Davis, of Indiana,) resumed their places at the
Clerk's desk.
Mr. KILGrORE. I move that this election be
postponed until next Monday. [Cries of "Oh
no!" from the Democratic benches.] Oh yes!
^Mr. RUFFIN. E hopethismatterof the spoils
will not be deferred any longer. Bills are before
the House that ought to be printed. I saw pub-
lished in the New York Herald, the other flay,a
bill of great importance to my constituents that
I have never seen before. I hope gentlemen of
the Republican party will not squabble about this
little matter of the printing spoils any longer. It
is a disgrace to the country. I hope we shall go
on and elect somebody and have the printing done.
Mr. KILGORE. Mr. Tappan is detained at
home, as I am informed, by sickness in his fam-
ily. If we can get a pair for him we are ready to
vote.
There are several absentees

Yes, without pairs.
Who are they?
—   I do not know.
Mr. KILGORE. I have inquired their names,
but I cannot find out who they are.
Mr. WASHBURiNE, ot llfinois. I hope that
the motion to postpone the election will be with-
drawn, and that we shall proceed to vote.
Ml. KILGORE. I hope we shall not go into
a veto with the eulvantage in favor of our adver-
saries.
The SPEAKER. Docs the gentleman from
Indiana withdraw his motion to postpone?
Mr. KILGORE. No, sir; I cannot.
Mr. BURNETT. On that motion I call for
the yens and nays.

Before the roll-call had been completed,
Mr. IllLUORE. I undeistand that, since the
commencement of the roll-ell, a pair has been
arranged for Mr. Tappan. My object in moving
to postpone the election until Monday was for
the purpose of having Mr. Tafpak in attendance.
As a pair has been procured for him, I will, with

There being no objection, the motion to post-
