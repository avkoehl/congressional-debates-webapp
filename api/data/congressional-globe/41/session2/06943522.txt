rights of citizens in the States. We were absent
by order of the House.
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot enter-
tain that request under the rule. The excuse
•would have been sufficient had the gentleman
come in after the last name on the roll was
called and before tiie result of the vote was
announced.
Mr. COX. The committee were not in a
condition to do that.
The SPEAKER. The Chair regrets to hear
it. [Laughter. ]
Mr. W00 D W ARD. Althoughnotappointed
on the committee originally, the committee
took me with them, bo that I was not here
when the bill was put on its passage. Had I
been hfre I would have voted *'no."
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Gentlemen have told us
how they would have voted in the condition
they were in yesterday had they been here. I
would like to know how they would vote in
the condition they are in now. [Laughter.}
Mr. GETZ. 1 was absent with the com-
mittee yesterday. Had I been here I would
have voted "no" on the bill of the gentleman
from Ohio, [Mr. Bingham.}
Mr. JOHNSON. I also was absent at the
ceremonies yesterday. I desire to say that if
I had been here I should have voted "no" oa j
the bill already referred to.
SOLDIEUS' MONUMENT AT MQRRISTOWN.
Mr. HILL. I ask unanimous consent to j
introduce for consideration at the present time j
a joint resolution donating condemned cannon j
to the Soldiers' Monument Association of ]
Morris county, New Jersey.
The SPEAKER. The joint resolution will
be read, after which there will be an oppor-
tunity for objection.
The joint resolution was read-, It author-
izes the Secretary of War. to furnish to the
Soldiers' Monument Association of Morris
county, New Jersey, four.pieces of condemned
cannon and fifty cannon balls, to be placed
about the monument to be erected at Morris-
town, the county seat of said county.
Mr. MAYNARD. Does this proposition
come from the Committee on Military Affairs?
The SPEAKER. It does not. The gentle-
man from New Jersey [Mr. Hill] asks unani-
mous consent to introduce it and put it on its
passage at the present time.
Mr. MAYNARD. Unless the joint reso-
lution is to go to the Committee on Military
Affairs I must object to its introduction. We
have.beea giving away a great many of these
cannon. We do not know how many more
there are.,
Mr. HILL. There are plenty of them. I
inquired at the War Department the day be-
fore yesterday.
Mr. MAYNARD. I cannot consent to let
the resolution go through without consideration
by the appropriate, committee.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from
New Jersey desire to introduce the resolution
for reference?
Mr. HILL. No, sir; I withdraw it.
ISLAND INSTITUTE.
Mr. FERRY, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill (H. R. No. 2046) granting theuse
of-a public reservation in the City of Washing-
ton to the Island Institute ; which was read a
first and second time, and referred to the
Committee for the District of Columbia.
Mr. RANDALL moved to reconsider the
Vote by which the bill was referred ; and atao
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on
the table,.
The latter niotion was agreed to.
' american commerce.
Mr. ALLISON. I call for the regular order.
The SPEAKER: The regular order being
called for, the morning hour now begins. The
Hduse resumes the consideration of the bill
reported by the gentletnan from'Maine [Mr.
Lthch} ■ frotn the select Committee on the
Cause of the Decline of American Tonnage,
being House bill No. 1889, to revive the nav-
igation and commercial interests of the United
States. In pursuance of the arrangement
agreed to last Thursday by unanimous consent,
the morning hour this morning willhave seven-
teen minutes added to it. The gentleman from
New York [Mr. Wood] is entitled to the floor.
Mr. LYNCH. Before the gentleman from
Neta York [Mr. Wood] proceeds with> his
remarks I wish to give notice that I shall call
for a vote upon this bill next Thursday.
Mr. ALLISON. I trust the gentleman from
Maine will reconsider that determination. It
will leave us only two hours of debate upon
this important measure.
Mr. LYNCH. On Thursday next the bill
will have run through five morning hours ; and
I suppose that is as much time as the House
cares to give to the subject at this stage of the
session. I will say to the gentleman from
Iowa [Mr. Allison] that I do not intend to
occupy more than fifteen minutes of the clos-
ing hour to which I shall be entitled, and I
shall be willing to yield to the gentleman all
the remainder of my time if he desires it, or
probably he can obtain a full hour in his own
right. !
Mr. MUNGEN. Before the gentleman from
New York goes on with his speech I ask him
to yield to me that I may offer a resolution.
Mr. WOOD. 1 will do so if it will not give
rise to debate.
Mr. MUNGEN. I ask unanimous consent
to offer the following resolution :
Whereas the following article, over the signature
of Hon. H. Van Aernam, Commissioner of Pensions,
I is going the rounds—
Mr. WOOD. I cannot yield for that reso-
lution, aa it will doubtless lead to debate.
Mr. MUNGEN. Let it be referred to the
Committee on Pensions.
Mr. MAYNARD. I must object unless the
resolution be read.
Mr. WOOD. I decline to yield for that
purpose.
The SPEAKER. The resolution is not
before the House; i
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Speaker, the question
before the House is one of absorbing public
interest. It is a subject of direct practical
importance to the Atlantic and Pacific sea-
boards, to the internal industries of the coun-
try, which seek a foreign market for their
products, and to the thoughtful consideration
of the legislator and the statesman. In ap-
proaching its discussion last oonscious of my
inability. So many questions arise, each of
importance, and more or less connected with
and dependent upon each other, that -I shrink
from the attempt to present them intelligently
to the House. I shall endeavor to be practi-
cal and direct, leaving to others the. elabora-
tion of much that I will offer in the way  f
suggestion and proposition.
First, let me address myself to a popular
! error which assumes the decadence of Ameri-
j can foreign commerce. It is a common topic
! of complaint that these commercial interests
of the country are paralyzed, and that there
is a rapid decline in American 'commerce.
So frequently has this been of late stated by
the - press, the merchant, and the politician
that it appears to have become the fixed opin-
ion, and accepted as true by the American and
European mind. But such is not the fact.
Our commerce is not on the decline. At no
period within our history has it been in a better
condition. I make this statement without fear
of successful contradiction. It is based upon
official data, and comprehends both foreign
and domestic trade. Those who have assumed
to the contrary have confounded our foreign j
commerce with the carrying trade. They have jj
not seten the difference existing between com- j
merce and navigation. What constitutes the 1
foreign commerce of a country? It is the |
aggregate of the importB and exports of met- j
nhnndiae which toeether comprise the volume l
of the foreign trade, and this constitutes that,
commerce. The tonnage which bears it to
and from our shores is an agency of com-
merce and no part of commerce itself. It is
not an article of merchandise. It is what is
i known simply as a common carrier, perform-
I ing the functions of a transit agency, and is in
no sense within itself an element of barter or
exchange. Its uses are of hire to those who
buy and sell, rather than au article to be bought
and sold. Now, with this obvious fact pre-
sented, let us see what is the condition of the
foreign trade of the United States, and whether
I am right in the statement that it is not on
the decline, and not in a discouraging con-
dition.

There has been a gratifying increase in our
foreign commerce. The imports and exports,
which together form the total foreign commerce
of the country, amounted in 1869 to a larger
sum than ever before, with the exception ol'
1860, the year succeeding the late war, when it
was stimulated by artificial causes. Not only
does the aggregate commerce of the country
show a continued increase, but the relations
which exports and'imports bear to each other
also show an increased prosperity.' I present
another table giving the imports and exports of
merchandise- from 1850 to 1869, by which it
will be seen we send abroad as much in value
in merchandise' as we receive from foreign
countries in return:
Total exports and imports of merchandise from 1850 to
1869.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, am I not right in
! saying that the oft-repeated declaration that
' the foreign commerce of the country is on the
decline is not well, founded ? I have felt it my
,duty to expose the fallacy of this prevalent
belief, and I think, the figures presented sus-
tain me.. Rut with reference tp American
tonnage a very different state of things exists.
. That, there has been.a great decrease in, tlus
there ean be no doubt. While we have im-
ported and-exported more merchandise tuan
ever before, comparatively less of it has been
done in American, bottoms than ever before,
i It is scarcely necessary to present any staus-
