HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, ARMY OF Georgia,December 20, 1864-8 a. m.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp, Military Division of the Mississippi:

CAPTAIN: I am now fully prepared to execute any orders the General-in-chief may issue. All our batteries are finish, but the six 20-pounders guns have not yet come. As soon as they are received I think I can silence the enemy's guns and make a successful assault. If you have any information as to the 20-pounder guns I wish you would give it to me. I have teams waiting for them. I have a brigade on the South Carolina shore.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, December 20, 1864-12 m.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Yours of 8 a. m. just to hand. The General-in-chief has not yet returned from the Bay. I expect him this p. m., when yours shall be placed before him. Being five miles from the dock, and all the staff with the General, I am unable to give you any information as regards the 20-pounders, but will try to find out, and will write you promptly all I can learn. There is no news, and no later papers than you have seen.

I am, General, with respect, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, December 20, 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: General Howard reports being ready; but the General-in-chief has not returned, and has not, to my knowledge, authorized any orders. We are therefore in a respectable condition to remain quiet until he gives orders of execution. Word from King's Bridge says plenty of rations there; also oats, &c.

I am, General, with respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
