SUFFOLK, VA., April 24, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

It is very muddy and much water on the ground, but I think it advisable to make a demonstration on the swamp flank. Shall be very glad to see you. If you come let me know the hour of leaving.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 24, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Six prisoners were taken this afternoon. They state no troops have left. A rumor was in circulation that troops were coming to both armies from Fredericksburg. Supplies come to them from Franklin. They say General French is much censured for losing the artillery. Hear nothing of troops leaving. Waiting to strike us outside.

General Getty just reports that the enemy are erecting works at new points on the river.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 24, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Richmond papers state that Longstreet has been re-enforced. They are despondent about his campaign. This afternoon I made a demonstration on his right, resting on the Edenton road. Thus far my operations have been successful.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 24, 1863-9.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I went to Suffolk this morning and returned this evening. General Corcoran was sent with a strong force at 1 o'clock. General Peck, whose excellent arrangements I cannot too highly commend, just sent the following dispatch:

SUFFOLK, VA., April 24, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

We made a successful demonstration on Longstreet's right flank in a heavy rain. The enemy was routed out of all his advance rifle-pits and driven back to his main defenses at Darden's Mill Dam in a very handsome manner, where several batteries are posted, and it is thought that a large force is massed between the Edenton and Somerton roads. Our loss was only 35, and the object of the movement was fully attained. Corcoran, Foster, and Spear were out. The bayonet was used with effect.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
