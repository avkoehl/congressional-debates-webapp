Your requisition, in my judgment, is illegal, unconstitutional, and revolutionary in its object, in human and diabolical, and cannot be complied with. Not one man will the State of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade.

C. F. JACKSON,

Governor of Missouri.

OMAHA, NEBR. TER., April 17, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMBERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I herewith tender to the Government a sufficient number of volunteers from this Territory to garrison Forts Kearny and Randall and to afford ample protection to the frontier settlements. The withdrawal of the troops from those posts has already caused much alarm among our people of trouble from the Indians. The absence of the troops from the forts will remove all restraint from them . Our past experience proves to us that we shall not escape their hostility in such a case. I deem it absolutely important that some measures should be taken to keep the Indians in check. I address this communication to you, as the lately appointed Governor, Honorable Alvin Saunders, has not yet reached the Territory.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

J. M. THAYER,

Major-General of Nebraska Militia.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Trenton, N. J., April 17, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: This morning yours of the 15th instant was received, calling for four regiments of militia from this State. Measures will be immediately taken to comply with the requisition. A few days will be necessary to ascertain when the men will probably be at the place of rendezvous, information of which will be sent you as early as possible.

Very respectfully, yours,

CHS. S. OLDEN.

ALBANY, N. Y., April 17, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMBERON,

Secretary of War:

Will General Government uniform and equip the volunteer militia raised by this State? Will it accept one more regiments at New York now ready and transport them to Washington?

E. D. MORGAN.

[Indorsement.]

Reply: Not uniform, but equip. Will accept all.
