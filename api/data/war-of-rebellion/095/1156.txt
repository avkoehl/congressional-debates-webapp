The command lay in the order in which it was halted until the morning of the 10th, when it marched to Prospect Station; camped for the night. 11th, marched to Sandy Creek; 12th, to Burkeville; 13th, to Nottoway Court-House, where the brigade is now encamped.

I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of the officers and men of the command. I forbear mentioning the names of any officers lest I do injustice to others, as all conducted themselves in the most gallant manner. To the members of my staff am I specially indebted for valuable services.

For report of casualties sustained in campaign please see report furnished this date.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. B. M. YOUNG,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
