THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 9,
baps necessarily—enjoyed by the parties, in
the proportion of forty-nine days consumed by
the contestant and only nineteen by the incum-
bent, and not at all-owing to any wantof cour-
tesy on the part of the contestant. _ It is sug-
gested that in a matter so interesting to the
candidates and their constituencies, and so
important to the public, further opportunity
should be afforded to the incumbent to produce
his witnesses, if indeed his case needs any fur-
ther testimony. On this point he will person-
ally submit the facts to the committee, to show
the impossibility of producing all his proofs
within the time allowed to him.
An examination of the' proofs will also show
that they exhibit the allegations of the respect-
ive parties as follows;
First. On behalf of the incumbent;

In addition to the above scattering cases two
divisions of the seventeenth ward are to be
added, namely:
Sixth division of the seventeenth ward 45
Seventh division of the seventeenth ward 29
74
In addition to these heads of proof the con-
testant claims that the first hour of the vote in
the sixth division of the seventeenth ward, and
the entire vote in the sixth and seventh divis-
ions of that ward, be rejected as if no election
had been held; or, failing in that demand, that
the unassessed voters be excluded from the
count.
In considering the evidence the following
suggestions naturally occur:
1. The quantum of hearsay testimony is sur-
prising. It is so clearly illegal that comment
is unnecessary; and to strike it out will leave
but little in the case to be discussed.
2. It seems to have been taken for granted
that proof of the printed "heading" on the
outside of one of a bundle of tickets—the type
used by the parties being somewhat different—
is sufficient proof of their contents. This is a
non sequitur.
3. The proof that A was an illegal voter is
immaterial unless it is accompanied or fol-
lowed by proof for whom he voted, because he
may have voted for the party who proves the
illegality of the vote.
4. The very natural bias of witnesses ar-
dently engaged at and about an election poll,
at an election of unusual excitement, is appar-
ent on both sides in the evidence.
5. Evidence of occurrences at the November
election, with which the record is liberally
supplied, is irrelevant, not only on account of
the difference in the prospects of the respective
parties after the October election, but because
it does not apply to any specification, except
where the receipt or rejection of votes of the
same persons who voted in November shed a
light upon their right to vote in October.
6. The contestant's case, so far as rejates to
the very material and indispensable proof of
who reeeived the votes of illegal voters, de-
pends almost entirely upon the uncertain and
deceptive "headings" printed on the outside
of tickets, often simulated to deceive, and
never indicating whether the inside names are
erased, or, as it is called, "scratched."
In applying the evidence to the specifications
it will simplify the arrangement to consider the
specific allegations in their order, instead of
considering the aggregate charges which re-
appear in detail in specifications which follow
them; for instance, the aggregate charges in
the second specification are followed by specific
specifications from 3 to 19 inclusive, and the
like general charges in specifications 20 to 24
also are followed by charges in detail.
The specifications 3 to 19 are based upon
written election papers, and not corroborated
by the testimony of any of the officers of elec-
tion. It is manifest that a correct decision of
these alleged errors cannot be arrived at unless
the honorable committee subject the papers to
their personal inspection. The certified copies
do not exhibit the appearance, erasures, or
other tests of accuracy, and every presumption
of law favors the final official returns, which
these alleged errors purport to contradict. It
is asked that the committee will direct the
production of the original papers.
Specification 25. This contains a variety of
charges affecting the election in the fourth di-
vision of the seventeenth ward, and Mr. Painter
(page 73) was called to sustain them. He gave
the names of twelve persons whom he specifies
as doubtful, but Mr. Gilchrist (page 416) ap-
pears to have removed his doubts as to all but
one—Swartz, who voted, but for whom does
not appear—and no other witness was called
except Mr. Conaway, at page 184. There was
no attempt to call the persons who voted for
Mr. Myers, nor to show for whom the persons
whose votes were at first doubted voted. This
specification falls.
Specification 26. This contains a number
of charges affecting the election held in the
fifth division of the seventeenth ward, but no
evidence was offered to sustain it.
Specifications 27 and 28, attacking the elec-
tions held in the sixth and seventh divisions
of the seventeenth ward, appear to have been
the principal battle-ground of the contest, and
will be considered after disposing of the
charges requiring brief discussion.
Specification 29 assails the election held in
the eighth division of the seventeenth ward,
but no evidence was offered to sustain any of
the averments contained in it.
Specification 30 asserts that in each of the
seven divisions of the twelfth ward votes to
the number of 10 and upward were received
and counted for the incumbent from persons
not qualified to vote. This and the succeeding
five finishing specifications involve fifty-nine
election polls, at which over 27,000 votes were
received. Every division in the congressional
district is included in these lumping specifica-
tions ; not one is omitted, and it is necessary
to notice each one in detail.'
Ward 12, division 1. The evidence subdi-
vides itself into references to two classes of
alleged illegal voting; first, non-residents, &c.;
second, voters who were naturalized by the
supreme court. First, at page 100, Joseph H.
Brown testifies that some one challenged him
on the ground that some one had voted on his
name and residence. Who the first Brown had
voted for was not known by Rickards, (page
103,) who only said that the ticket had the
Democratic heading. At page 103 it was proved
that John W. Wilkinson, when he voted in
another division at the November election,
swore that he voted at the October election in
the twelfth ward, at Fourth and Wood streets ;
that he had moved a week before the October
election. There is an act of Assembly in Penn-
sylvania that a person wlio has removed within
ten days before an electron may vote in the
division from which he removed, and the court
of common pleas of Philadelphia has ruled
