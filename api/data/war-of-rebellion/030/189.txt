COLONEL: I have the honor to forward the following extract from a communication just received from Brigadier-General Davis:
HEADQUARTERS NINTH DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS.

General Negley has just reported that his foraging party was fired into by the rebel advance, under Buckner, near Brentwood. I don't understand it, as I have just come from near Brentwood myself, and all was quiet there and along the entire line of pickets.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
