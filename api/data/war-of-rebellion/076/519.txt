the number at 2,000, and heavy artillery heard at Varnell's Station all day. I am in a poor position for defense here owing to General Steedman's order, and do not expect to save the depot or public stores in case of attack. I would like to have you come here and see for yourself.

General AMMEN:

Captain Crowell, at Varnell's, reports Dalton in possession of the rebels; General Steedman thinks it is not the case. I have sent a train to Varnell's to bring away the garrison if the commandeer thinks he cannot hold his position.
