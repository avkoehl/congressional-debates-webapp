road which leads down to the right of our fortifications in the edge of the valley. After several unimportant changes of position, it occupied in the afternoon a point several hundred yards to the right of this road, and after remaining there an hour or two it was moved, by order of the major-general commanding, again to the left and posted in the rifle-pits immediately to the right of the road referred to. Here it was subjected to the fire of the enemy's artillery while he moved against the troops on the left, and also from his sharpshooters when the advancing lines approached the crest of the ridge.

My position was not attacked in front, but about 4 o'clock, when the lines had been forced on the left and after the enemy had reached the top of the ridge, the major-general commanding directed me to form my line across the ridge at right angles to the position I then occupied. This change was made under a brisk fire of the enemy, who advanced upon me along the crest of the ridge. The fire was kept up until after dark, but the position was held, the enemy not approaching nearer than 200 yards, and not in very large force.

At 7.45 o'clock the major-general commanding directed me to move my command in a half an hour from that time to Chickamauga Station, by the way of the railroad bridge. At the appointed time I moved to the point indicated, having left a line of skirmishers, under command of Captain G. W. Reynolds, Twenty-ninth Mississippi Regiment, in front of the line I occupied, and about midway between it and the position held by the enemy, about 300 yards in front, with which, after my command was withdrawn, that gallant and efficient officer covered its rear.

I submit herewith a list of casualties and the reports of regimental commanders, to which I respectfully refer.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. C. WALTHALL,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

Major JAMES D. PORTER, Jr.,
