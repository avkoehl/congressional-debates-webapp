tion of the manufacture, importation, and sale
of all intoxicating liquors to be used as a bev-
erage in the Territories of the United States

Mr. SUMNER. I also present the petition
of a large number of mercantile houses of
Boston, headed by George M. Barnard, in
which they set forth their considerable losses
from the war premiums jsaid on their vessels
owing to the depredations of the British
cruisers during oar rebellion. They say that
they paid to insurance companies for insuring
against capture and loss on the high seas a
premium wholly distinct and separate from the
usual premium for marine risks, and they
estimate the loss on that account in the single
port of Boston at more thaw nine hundred
thousand dollars, and they pray that in any
bill which may be adopted by Congress pro-
viding for the distribution of the fund now
coming to the United States, their claim may
be taken into consideration. I believe the
bill on this subject has gone to the Committee
on the Judiciary.

â€¢ of this important petition to that committee.

sent a petition numerously signed by citizens
of the Uftited States, who say that they are

j REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.
J Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the Com-
| mittee on Finance, to whom was referred the
| bill (H. R. No. 2934) revising and amending
the laws relative to the mints and assay offices
and coinage of the United States, to report it
back with two or three amendments. This
bill has in substance passed both Houses,
except that the Senate bill enlarged and in-
i creased the salaries of officers of the Mint. It
was passed by the Senate at the last session
of the last Congress, went to the House, tnd
now, somewhat modified, has passed the House
at this Congress, so that the bill has practi-
cally passed both Houses of Congress. The
Senate Committee on Finance propose the
modification of only a single section ; but as
this is not the same Congress that passed the
bill in the Senate, I suppose it will have to go
through the form of a full reading, unless the
Senate are willing to take it on the statement
of the committee, the Senate having already
debated it at length and passed it. It would
have to be read in full unless the Senate by
unanimous consent allow it to pass without a
formal reading.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Ohio reports back a House bill in regard
to the government of mints and assay offices,
and regulating coinage, with an amendment
as an additional section, and asks for its pres-
ent consideration.
Mr. SHERMAN. No; I will not ask for
its present consideration, because I suppose
any Senator would have the right to require
that the bill be read at length.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Let it be printed.
Mr. SHERMAN. It has been printed, and
it is scarcely necessary to reprint it, because
there is but one section that is proposed to be
amended.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Ohio states that the Committee on Fi-
nance adopt the House print with the excep-
tion of one section.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The rules require that
all reports shall be printed. Of course, I do
not want to incur additional expense, but we
ought to have printed the change made by the
committee, so that we can gee that.
Mr. SHERMAN. I simply make this state-
ment to show that this is a House bill, and is a
bill that substantially passed the Senate at one
time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Unless the print-
ing of the bill is desired by some Senator, the
amendments of the committee only will be
ordered to be printed.
Mr. COLE. As the bill is not to be con-
sidered this morning, I think it had better be
printed in full, with the amendments of the
committee.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will bo
printed with the amendments.
Mr. SHERMAN. Iam also directed by
