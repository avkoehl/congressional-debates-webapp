Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Your note of 9. 30 a. m. is received. I have already made a better examination of the position in my front than I am able to now that we have taken up a new line. If it is true that the enemy are massing troops on our right, I do not think we could detach enough troops for and attack to insure success. I do not think the ground in my front, held by the enemy, possesses any peculiar advantages for him. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.
