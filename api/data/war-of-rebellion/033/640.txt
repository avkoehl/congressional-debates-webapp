JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 12, [1863.]

Colonel N. COLE,

Commanding troops near Boonville,

Via Tipton and California.

Continue vigorously in the pursuit. Send me word the direction the enemy have gone in. Keep me posted.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 12, 1863

Commanding Officer at Tipton;

General Ewing left Sedalia this evening to co-operate with General Brown. If you can learn where Brown and Ewing are, send word to both, that they may know where they mutually are and in what direction moving, and in what direction the rebels are going. These instructions must be attended to all the time, and are of the greatest importance. Send expresses to both generals whenever you learn anything reliable. Keep your expresses and scouts moving.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 12, 1863

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department, Saint Louis, Mo.:

A disorderly soldier of the First Nebraska, hurrahing for Jim Lane in the streets, was arrested this morning. Several others of the regiment came to telegraph office, where I was with the prisoner and objected to his arrest. I arrested them also, and ordered all others to their quarters. I sent Major Barnes for Colonel Pound and Colonel Baumer, and going up he met officers and men of that regiment to the number of 200, and repeated to them my order for enlisted men to go to their quarters. The men resisted, and rescued one whom Major Barnes had arrested, officer resisted. A number of officers of the regiment in this state of things had the audacity to ask me to release their men, thereby upholding this mutinous spirit. The troops I have with me are unreliable. If you possibly can, send me a good regiment.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General
