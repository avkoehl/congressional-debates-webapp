If General Kautz is anywhere near you please send out an aide and stop his return here. The lieutenant-general desires me to send him to report to Sheridan at once, to go to the aid of Wilson. Major Ludlow goes with with a written order to that effect. I leave immediately for the fort [Monroe].

General RAWLINS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The 30-pounders on the river got the rangers of the bridges very nicely yesterday, and to-day have been doing good service in hitting. They have not yet injured them so seriously as to break them down, though they have hit them several times. They have, in addition to this, burned the steamer lying at Pocahontas Bridge. The mortars on river-bank have done good service in aiding to silence artillery fire.
