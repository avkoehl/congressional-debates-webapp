But is the tariff on coal added to its price?
Of course the importer pays the duty, but it
does not follow that the cousumer would get
it $1 25 per ton cheaper if there was no duty
to pay. If there was no home production
there would be no competition iu the market;
and the importer of foreign coal, having driven
his rivals from the field, would fix his own
price. If the demand was active, the price
would be high ; if the market was dull, the
price would be low. It is not denied that
Nova Scotia coal can be delivered in Boston
and New York cheaper than American coal,
and the reasons are obvious. First, a dollar
of our money is worth only about eighty-eight,
cents in gold ; secondly, labor is much better
paid here; and thirdly, the freights from the
water-bound coal fields are much lower than the
freights from the American mines. Now, if
the duty on coal adds just so much to its price,
then the price ought to have been $1 25 lower
from 1861 to 1866 than it has been from 1866
to 1871, for during the first period of five
years Nova Scotia coal paid no duty. Here
is a fair test of the theory, and a test, too,
from which the theory shall not escape, and
tried by which it must perish. Facts are stub-
born things, and upon this question, so vital
are they to its just determination, that they
must be met and answered ; they shall not be
evaded.
From the Boston Shipping List and Price
Current I take the average yearly price of
Nova Scotia coal at Boston, for the period
often years, from 1861 to 1871, as follows :

In 1866, when a duty of $1 25 was imposed,
the price of Pictou coal, instead of rising, fell
$1 00, and in 1870 it was just three dollars
lower, with the duty, than it was in 1865 with-
out it, and $3 80 lower than it was in 1864 when
there was no duty. What do facts like these
teach us? Simply that foreign capitalists sell
their coal for the very highest price they can
get, and as the demand increases and the pro-
duction diminishes, the price goes up. If the
free-trade theory as to coal is sound, that the
duty always increases the price and is simply
a tax upon the consumer, why is the price now
lower than when coal was admitted free? With
all this cry about the millions of dollars that
are paid as a bonus to the American coal in-
terests, the people of Boston to-day are buying
their coal cheaper than they have bought it
for nine years.
Mr. Chairman, there maybe a way by which
to account for this devotion to the Pictou coal
fields by the Representatives of New England.
The report of the Pictou Mining Company,
organized since the expiration of the recipro-
city treaty, shows that a large majority of their
directors are citizens of the United States.
These persons have voluntarily invested then-
capital in British soil, with the law before
them, imposing a duty of $1 25 upon coal.
Our people with the same law have developed
American mines and added to the wealth and
prosperity of our country ; and now the Amer-
ican Congress is asked to withdraw its recog-
nition of the claims of this great home indus-
try, and to compel it to make this unequal
fight unaided, or die.
If the men who own the coal mines would
be the only sufferers from the adoption of
such a policy, the question would lose its
real importance. But its certain and inevit-
able effect will be to depress labor, to reduce
wages, and to leave our large mining popu-
lation, with their dependent families, either
without employment at all, or with employ-
ment at greatly reduced wages. Many of them
are unfitted for any other kind of manual
labor, and even if it were offered, they would
be unable to support their families at it.
And as this large element of our population
would thus suffer, the farmer, the merchant,
and the mechanic would suffer with them.
Business would become dull, mo'ney scarce,
and general discontent would prevail in all
our densely settled bituminous-coal regions.
Nor would the results of this policy be local.
Within the last few years hundreds of thou-
sands of bushels of wheat have been brought
from the West into my district, ground into
Hour, and sold there to the operators in coal
and iron. Prosperous industry diffuses its
blessings everywhere. The East has prof-
ited by the investment of its capital, the
West has had the benefit of an improved
market, and the laborer has been able to
gather his wife and his children under a roof
which he can call his own.
To show the extent and the rapid growth
of this business, I here furnish a statement,
exhibiting the number of tons of American
bituminous coal used in the Atlantic sea-
board States for the last ten years, from
1862 to 1871, inclusive :

The production this year will be about five
million tons ; and each ton of coal is estimated
to represent the labor of three men for one
day. ^ As the average working time of each
man is known to be about two hundred and
twenty-six days in a year, the number of men
engaged in the production and transportation
of bituminous coal is about sixty five thou-
sand; and they represent a population of over
three hundred thousand. All these persons
must be fed and clothed, and as they produce
nothing that they eat or wear, they furnish a
market for those who do. If we average the
yearly wages of each hand at $500, we have
the sum of $325,000 contributed aunually to
'he wealth and prosperity of the country. May
| not, then, in the name and on behalf of this
large army of honest laboring men, their
wives and children, appeal for justice at the
hands of the American Congress?
The bill of the chairman of the committee
further proposes a reduction of one dollar on
pig iron per ton : one quarter of a cent per
pound on one class of bar iron, and one half
a cent on another; and on railroad iron ten
cents per one hundred pounds. Pennsylvania
pig iron is famous inside and outside of Con-
gress. It has served many a troubled candi-
date for reelection to a seat in this House. In
addressing his " dear people," he felt sure
• here was one subject that, would never desert
him. When everything else failed he could
fall back upon "the Pennsylvania iron mas-
ters."
I am not their defender. Tbey are numer-
ous and powerful in my district, and, with but,
a few exceptions, they of both parties pre-
ferred, as they had a right to prefer, another
for the seat I hold here. They are now mak-
ing money, and making it rapidly. They
freely admit, that if the production and de-
mand were to continue as they are now they
would not feel the proposed reduction in the
tariff. But this is uncertain, and perhaps
impossible. The business involves a large
expenditure of capital, and is attended with
great risks. When it is prosperous it yields
handsome returns, hut when the market, grows
heavy the profits vanish as rapidly as Ihey
came The nature of the business commends
it to the fostering care of the country. The
ore as it lies buried in our mountain sides is
comparatively of little value, but when trans-
formed by the several processes of labor it
becomes of immense worth.
The aggregate value of our iron interests is
almost incalcu'abie, and yet five sixths of it
represent nothing bnt labor. The gentleman
from Missouri, [Mr. Finkelxbprg,] who so
