it is frequently of vital importance that the dispatches they are bearing should be delivered without delay.

Officers and men serving on courier lines should never be arrested, except in the most extreme cases, as the absence from duty of one man frequently seriously impairs the efficiency of the line. Should it be necessary to arrest a courier, immediate provision must be made by the officer causing the arrest for the delivery of the dispatches he is bearing.

The nature of the service requires that the men employed on courier duty should procure forage and subsistence in a great measure from the country through which they pass, or in which they are stationed. Commanding officers and provost-marshals will therefore refrain from arresting couriers for foraging unless for some flagrant abuse of the privileges which have from necessity been accorded them.
