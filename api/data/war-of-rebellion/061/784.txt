Cage, and Lieutenant B. F. Scull, as volunteers, I am particularly indebted for the prompt and accurate manner my orders were transmitted to the various commands. Of these, Lieutenants Scull and Price, with my orderly (Private D. Kavenaugh), particularly distinguished themselves at Jenkins' Ferry by responding with alacrity to a call for volunteers to reconnoiter the enemy's position, riding coolly up to their ranks and receiving a heavy volley, which disclosed the Federal lines, but unfortunately took effect upon Lieutenant Scull, fracturing his leg, which was afterward captured.

Nor while enumerating the chivalric services of the living can the deeds of the heroic dead be forgotten. Their bright example will light others onward in the path to glory. The names of Grinsted, Cocke, Pettus, and Harris, who fell while gallantly leading their regiments, will be perpetuated with the memory of other heroes in the hearts of a grateful people.

Respectfully submitted.
