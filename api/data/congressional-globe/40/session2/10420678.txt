we may have an opportunity to reconsider and

called confederate States, and the number of Union

message from the house
A message from the House of Representa-

that the House had agreed to some amend-
ments, disagreed to others, and agreed to the
third amendment of the Senate to the bill
(H. R. No. 320) making appropriations to sup-
ply deficiencies in the appropriations for the
execution of the reconstruction laws, and for
the service of the quartermaster's department
of the Government, for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1868, and for other purposes, with an
amendment.
The message also announced that the House
had passed the following bills, in which it re-
quested the concurrence of the Senate :
A bill (H. R. No. 274) providing for holding
a circuit court at the city of Erie, Pennsyl-
vania;
A bill (H. R. No. 485) to aid the improve-
ment of the Des Moines and Rock Island rap-

relief of destitute in the district.
Mr. HARLAN. With the leave of the Sen-
ator from AVisconsin I desire to make a report.
The Committee on the District of Columbia,
to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 270) for
the temporary relief of destitute people in the
District of Columbia, have instructed me to
report it back with an amendment and recom-
mend its passage. I think it will take but a
few minutes to dispose of the bill. It is neces-
sary that it should be acted on at an early day ;
and if i; does not elicit any discussion I shall
be very much gratified if the Senate will agree
to take it up now.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I hardly think I can
consent to that.
Mr. HARLAN. This is a matter of charity,
and if the Senator objects to it of course he
has the power to control it.
The PRESIDENTprotfempore. It requires
unanimous consent to consider it at this time.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If it leads to no dis-
cussion I have no objection.
Mr. HARLAN. If it leads to any discus-
sion I shall not object to its going over.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No objec-
tion being made, the bill is before the Senate
as in Committee of the Whole, and will be read.
Mr. EDMUNDS, and others. What is the
bill? Let us hear it first.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That will
be found out after it is read.
The Secretary read the bill, which proposes
to appropriate the sum of $25,000 for the tem-
porary relief of ihe destitute population in the
District of Columbia, to be expended under
the supervision and direction of the Commis-
sioner of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned
Lands; but asfar as practicable this sum is to
be expended in the employment of persons
upon the public grounds and works in the Dis-
trict of Columbia for which appropriation shave
been heretofore made by Congress, such labor-
ers to be under the direction of the officer act-
ing as Commissioner of Public Buildings and
Grounds.
The Committee on the District of Columbia
reported an amendment to the bill, reducing
the appropriation from $25,000 to $15,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended, andthearaendment was concurred in.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading; and was read the third tiwv and
passed.
senator from maryland.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
following resolution submitted by Mr. Johnson
on the 18th of December, 1807:
Ilegolved, That Hon. Philip F. Thomas, Senator-
elect from Maryland, be admitted to his seat on hia
taking the oaths prescribed by tho Constitution and
laws of the United States.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. President, in act-
ing upon this case of the admission of Mr.
Thomas, Senator-elect from Maryland, we are
called upon to act in a judicial capacity; and
the same general rules which should control
judges and courts in weighing and determin-
ing the effect of testimony are the rules which
should govern us. I know that some extreme
cases have been supposed. Some Senators
have supposed the case of Mr. Davis and Mr.
Breckinridge being elected by the States in
which they reside as Senators to this body,
and appearing here and coming forward to the
desk and taking the oath which is required,
swearing positively that they had never en-
gaged in the rebellion or given it any aid, sup-
port, or countenance whatever; and they have
said that would be intolerable. These are
extreme cases which it is impossible should
ever arise. In the first place, it is not to bo
supposed that any State would ever elect a .
man Senator to this body who would come
here and deliberately commit open, palpable,
notorious perjury, and perjury which all the
world would know at once was a perjury the
moment the oath was taken. It is impossible
to suppose it. But, sir, even if that should
happen, that a State should elect a man who
was openly, notoriously, and actively engaged
in the rebellion, and he should come here and
go to that desk and take the oath by which he
would swear that he had not engaged in it,
when all the world knew that he had, it is just
as impossible to suppose that the Senate would
suffer any such man to remain as a Senator in
his seat here. They would expel him at once.
It is not by appealing to such extreme cases
as these that judges or courts or Senators can
properly weigh the testimony which is adduced,
and which alone should be considered in de-
ciding upon a question of this kind.
Mr. President, the only possible case which
can ever arise is a case where some doubt
must exist as to the fact whether the Senator-
elect did or did not sympathize with or coun-
tenance the rebellion. It is impossible to sup-
pose that Jefferson Davis, or Mr. Breckinridge,
or any person who was openly and actively
engaged in the rebellion, could come here and
take the oath which is required. The only
case where any doubt or difficulty can arise, is
where a person may have done acts which are
susceptible of a double construction; one
which is in accordance with his innocence, and
the other which would only be in accordance
with his guilt. Mr. President, it seems to me
that the law which has been passed by Con-
gress requiring the person to take this oath,
commonly called the test-oath, the "iron-clad
oath,'' is the very mode which Congress has
adopted in order to reach the conscience
of the person who appears here, to try and dis-
Eose of the question in the first instance. I
ave heard no Senator make any substantial
reply to the argument made the other day by
iny colleague, [Mr. Howe,]-and the argument
of the honorable Senator from Oregon [Mr.
Williams] yesterday, that this is the mode
which the law has established to try and
determine the question in the first instance.
I do not say that it goes so far as to prevent
the Senate afterwards, after the Senator has
been admitted, from trying the question when
a motion is made to expel him; but in the
