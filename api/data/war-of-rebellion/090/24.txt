the direction of Winchester; met by Kershaw's division. Kershaw is on Early's right, covering the Berryville pike. I telegraphed you some time ago that Lieutenant-General Anderson was here. He has not assumed command (being senior to Early), as only a part of his corps is here, but that he is here is unquestionable. There is no truth in the newspaper report of the loss of Crook's ambulance train. Only one ambulance was lost and some twelve or thirteen horses. The train was attacked and badly stampeded by six of Mosby's men.

Nothing important to report to-day. My cavalry drove the pickets of Breckinridge's corps form Opequon Creek, burned 4 flouring mills, and captured 2 officers and 8 men of Breckinridge's command. The Potomac rose beyond fording last night, and I transferred to east side of Opequon Creek Averell's train and a portion of his cavalry, still holding Martinsburg pike, near Bunker Hill, and across to Gerrardstown.

NEAR BERRYVILLE, September 13, 1864 - 7 p. m.

(Received 14th.)

This morning I sent General Getty's division, of the Sixth Corps, with two brigades of cavalry, to the crossing of the Summit Point and Winchester road, over Opequon Creek, to develop the force of the enemy at the crossing in that vicinity. Rodes', Ramseur's, Gordon's, and Wharton's division were found on the west bank. At the same time General Wilson, with McIntosh's brigade of cavalry, dashed up the Winchester pike, drove the rebel cavalry at a run, came in contact with Kershaw's division, charged it, and captured the eighth South Carolina Regiment (16 officers and 145 men) and its battle-flag, and Colonel Henagan, commanding brigade, with a loss of only 2 men killed and 2 wounded. Great credit is due to General Wilson, McIntosh, and Third New Jersey and Second Ohio. the charge was a gallant one. A portion of the Second Massachusetts, Reserve Brigade, made a charge on the right of our line and captured 1 officer and 11 men of Gordon's division of infantry. Our loss in the reconnaissance is very light.

I have the honor to report that I attacked the forces of General Early on the Berryville pike at the crossing of Opequon Creek, and after a most stubborn and sanguinary engagement, which lasted from
