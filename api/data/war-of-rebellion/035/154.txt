March 20, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Our depots and defenses are being pushed forward here, with about 4,000 men daily at work. We occupy Triune by a strong force, well intrenched. All Granger's command, except Crook's brigade and four regiments of cavalry, at Franklin, where they are strongly entrenching. We are pushing forward supplies to Nashville, but, from the infrequence of convoys and want of transports, we are somewhat delayed. Our great want here is cavalry.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, March 20, 1863.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

No further news from Columbia. Have strong scouts out in the direction of Cumberland River. Twenty-five guerrillas stopped passenger train on Nashville road yesterday below Bowling Green, but were driven off a squad of Colonel Smith's men, who are still pursuing. Telegraph cut between Bowling Green and Gallatin. Rebel prisoners taken by Ninth Kentucky Cavalry say the State will be immediately invaded by Breckinridge and Morgan.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
