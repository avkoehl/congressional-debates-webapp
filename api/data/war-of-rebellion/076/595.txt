General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I have Secretary Stanton's dispatch announcing the promotion of Colonel Long, a hard-working and worthy cavalry officer. We have had heavy demonstrations all day, especially on our flanks, to hold the enemy while our cavalry is out after the Macon road. I hope this time the works will be better done than before. We control all other railroads. General Dodge received a ball wound in his forehead, but it is pronounced not serious. All well.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I send following message, Vinning's, &amp;c. Can't that have been Kilpatrick?

VINING'S, August 19, 1864-1.30 a. m.

Captain CASE,

Chief Signal Officer:

Immense fire south by 15 degrees west, thirteen miles from here.

BRENT,

Signal Officer.

General THOMAS:

Fairburn is south 15 degrees west of Vining's. I have no doubt the fire referred to by the signal officer was caused by General Kilpatrick; he probably reached the railroad about that hour; but the distance from Vining's is greater than thirteen miles, near twenty.

Generals THOMAS and HOWARD:

General Schofield has been to the Newnan road at the point marked "Bacon" on the map. Enemy has a strong fort in the northeast corner of 190, whence his works run southeast to the West Point railroad. No opposition to General Schofield, who found the lines guarded, but none outside; he observed no movement down the road. What news have you?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
