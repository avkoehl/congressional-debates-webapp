States. Any deviation from said order can only be granted by the Secretary of War. The rules for the discharge of paroled prisoners are the same as in all other cases, either by expiration of term of service on surgeon's certificate of disability or by order of the Secretary of War. As to prisoners of war belonging to the rebel army instructions have been sent to the commandants of military prisons authorizing them to release all prisoners of war (no officers) who were willing to take the oath of allegiance in good faith. This privilege does not extend to guerrillas or other irregular organizations, who can only be released on application or recommendation of the Governor of the State in which he resides.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General JOHN E. WOOL,

Commanding Debarment of the East, New York City.

GENERAL: There are two political prisoners on parole in New York whom it is intended to send South for exchange and I have written letters to them directing them to report to the provost-marshal in this city without delay. Fearing that the letters may not be received I have the honor to ask for your assistance in securing their prompt arrival here. They are S. J. Anderson, paroled before June from Fort Lafayette, and John Innerarity, paroled January 20, 1862. The latter's address is care of O. G. Carter, esq., New York Mutual Insurance Company, 61, William street, New York. These men should come to this city under their paroled to report as directed. There are also paroled from Fort Lafayette the following named, viz: F. W. Williams, in Connecticut; Samuel Hoffman, no place given; John Benson, no place; A. A. Jackson, no place; John Loony, no place; Samuel Pike, no place, and Adlophe Mazurean, Boston. I have no means of knowing with what understanding these men were paroled, nor in most cases the place where they may be found nor whether they are subject to exchange. May I request of you the favor to ascertain if it is in your power those particulars for me, and in the cases where an exchange seems to be advisable to send the parties to this city immediately under their parole to report to the provost-marshal. Where there is a doubt about the propriety of an exchange the person might be sent here to have the question decided. Those who belong South only are expected to be exchanged. A steamer will leave this city on the 14th probably for City Point and citizens to be exchanged will be sent in her. It is therefore desirable that those coming from New York should be arrive before that day.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
