dakota triangular contest.
Mr. ARMSTRONG. 1 ask to present a
preamble and joint resolution for the relief of
disabilities in the Dakota triangular contest.
The Clerk read as follows:
Whereas the coveted seat of M. K. Aemsteong,
sitting Delegate in this House irom the territory
of Dakota, is contested by two of his late deieated
Republican opponents substantially upon the fol-
lowing grounds of disability, namely ; first, that he
had no business to be a Democrat; second, he had
no right to run for Congress; third, it was illegal for
hiui to receive more voies than either of the Repub-
lican candidates; and finally, that the people of
Dakota had no right to elect a Democrat to Congress
when two am bitious Republicans were running for
and counted upon the same ofiicc; and whereas it la
evident Irom the result of the late election in that
Territory that three political parties cannot run
thrco tickets and all besuccessful; and inasmuch as
it is plain, without debate, that three live Delegates
from one Territory cannot all sit m one congressional
chair, without the removal of " natural disabilities;"
and whereas the people ol Dakota are leartul of
being " represented to death," by a swarm ol con-
testants who desire to roll the sweet moisel #f mite-
age and compensation beneath tbeir tongues as a
healing salve lor political deieat; and whereas the
sitting Delegate is not indictable for being layered
with votes which his opponents expected to get, and
is not blamable lor receiving the highest number ot
votes at ttio polls, and in being awarded, as he was, tho
certificate of election by a Republican board of can-
vassers and tbo freo indorsement of a Republican
Legislature; and whereas this House does not con-
sider it an "outrage"for a Democrat to bo elceted
Delagate to Congress, provided ho behaves himself,
docs not vote on adjournment, nor make long
speeches on Ku Klux "outrages:" Therelore,
Jieit resolved by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives, <f?e.. That fair and deliberate elections by the
people of Dakota are hereby declared to be as valid
and legal as donbtlul majorities in the doubtful
States of New Hampshire and Connecticut; and that,
out ot respect to the choice ot the people of Dakota
ill the lato election, the sitting Delegate be permitted
to retain his seat in this House long enough, at
least, to warm the chair he sits in and to frank home
to his constituents all the speeches recently made by
members on the Ku Klas " outrageous bill."
And be it Jitrther resolved, That an "anxious
bench " lor Dakota contestants be prepared in tront
ol the Speaker's stand, and that the time lor taking
testimony ill tho Dakota triangular contest be ox-
tended throughout the Forty-Second Congress, and
whenever the contestants and sitting Delegate shall
have submitted ali their evidence, the Committee
of Elections are requested to report to tho House
whether they have made the important discovery
that, by any treak in politics, itireo men can be
elected to tho same office at the same time; and, if
so, how it is done.
[Great laughter.]
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot let this
pass without remarking that the preamble and
joint resolution have come in so far by avoid-
ing the rule. No such resolution could be
fairly offered under the call for bills and joint
resolutions. It- is evidently a matter outside
of the action of the House of Representatives,
and the Chair cannot allow it to be referred.
