Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

With General Torbert's division I advanced this p. m. on the right of the infantry line and drove the enemy from the Long Bridge and New Market roads and across that road. The New Market road, Central road, and Charles City road are occupied by the enemy. If am to go on I can go on the Long Bridge road and cross the Chickahominy at Bottom's Brigade. Colonel Comstock, aide-de-camp, said to me to-day that I should not go until enemy were driven, inside of fortifications at Chaffin's farm. The enemy's infantry is very long and extends over to Charles City road. I do not know when the enemy will be driven into the works at Chaffin's farm.

Major-General, Commanding.
