Commanding Dept. of the Missouri, Fort Leavenworth, Kans:

Dispatch received. Have only 100 men on duty on line. Proclaimed martial law on 6th instant. Called for 360 mounted militia; will have them this week. Am embarrassed by district lines; extends northwest about forty miles. Territory of Colorado should be district. Am expected to protect this people out of my district 150 miles. Heretofore no co- operation with troops whose duty it was to do the work, Julesburg is in Colorado Territory. Will open the route and keep it open with militia, but it goes hard. What is department called! Where is headquarters! Will send history of affairs by first mail.

What are your district lines! In opening communication or driving off Indians no attention should be paid to lines. General Mitchell and Colonel Livingston have been instructed to co- operate with you. What posts besides Julesburg are in Colorado that are not under your orders! Telegraph me all you know about the Indians.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
