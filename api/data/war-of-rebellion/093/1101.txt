Major General J. B. STEEDMAN:

I have two infantry and one dismounted cavalry regiment and the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry. I think this movement is a cavalry raid upon this road, but it may be that the enemy is marching for East Tennessee. I was informed by General Rousseau that you would be upon this line with a force. Are you coming?
