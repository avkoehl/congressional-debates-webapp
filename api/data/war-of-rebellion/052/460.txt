WAGNER'S HEADQUARTERS, September 8, 1863-1 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have had communication with Burnside. His cavalry are at Washington. Burnside's headquarters are at Knoxville. Buckner passing from Haile's road in direction of Rome, not reliable. No other force left but division supposed to be Cheatham's; works at his command abandoned. Infantry above Chattanooga relieved by cavalry. Forrest said to be in direction of Rome. Enemy strongly fortified between Lookout Mountain and river. Wood had a fight with them yesterday; he is in Lookout Valley. Will shell the enemy at Lookout Mountain from this side to-day, in order to aid Wood. We are making a demonstration with Wood. Have reported to you more by courier. We have boats to cross in as soon as able.

Enemy broke their pontoons last night.

General WAGNER:

I shall probably make a demonstration to-morrow to the point of Lookout Mountain. Be on your watch, and do all your can to worry them. Do not waste ammunition. Try and find a signal station on Walden's Ridge. That point can be seen from Raccoon Mountain. Raccoos is the next spur below Lookout. The point is opposite Williams' Island. Can be seen plainly from Lookout.
