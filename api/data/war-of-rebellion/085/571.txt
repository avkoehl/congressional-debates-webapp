FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 2, 1864.

Colonel FORD,

Independence, Mo.:

I am informed Price has reached Franklin and Washington, on the Pacific Railroad. Try to get scouts to get intelligence and keep me posted. Also keep constant intercourse with General Brown and inform me what he hears. I want to know every move of Price now, from this on. The enemy below has crossed the Arkansas, and Price is now the dangerous foe.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 2, 1864.

General R. B. MITCHELL,

Omaha, Nebr. Ter.:

I am told you have passed down from Kearny. Suppose you are at Omaha. The mail leaves Atchison to-morrow for Kearny. Do all in your power to have it go through safe. Notify commanders of stations to escort. If possible strengthen the line between Plum and Julesburg. I am informed of the assault on a train near Plum on 29th. This is audacious, so near our station.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 2, 1864.

Colonel LIVINGSTON, Fort Kearny:

The Plum Creek affair was indeed audacious, so near Plum Creek. Try to find the villains. They must be on the north side Platte. Have telegraphed General Mitchell to try to strengthen your forces in that quarter. Try to have mails go through safe. They start to-morrow from Atchison.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 2, 1864.

Colonel CHIVINGTON, Denver:

Mail starts from Atchison to-morrow. The utmost effort must be made to secure its safe transit. Some trouble on Plum Creek on the 29th is may last news. Hope your part of the line beyond Julesburg is on the alert. Price's and other movements in Missouri detain Ford at present. Keep me posted.
