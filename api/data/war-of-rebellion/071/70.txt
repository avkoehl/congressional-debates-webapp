I telegraphed you last night not to send Graham's battery.

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 5, 1864 - 9. 30 p. m.

Governor BROUCH,

Continental Hotel, Philadelphia:

We have dispatches to-day from General Grant, but nothing new except operations in course of prosecution. Our forces hold the Maryland Heights, and with the troops sent there from here will probably be able to check the enemy until Hunter arrives. He has been heard from, and is pushing forward his forces. In no event will troops be withdrawing from General Grant. To secure as far as possible against detachments from the rebel army, and to strengthen Grant of required, 12,000 100-days' men have been called from New York, and 12,000 from Pennsylvania. But Governor Curtin, now as last year, annexes a condition that the Pennsylvania troops are not to be mustered into the United States service, so that we shall have to rely on New York and Ohio for national forces, except under a regular call and draft. Your views in respect to the 100-days men have been considered, and I think that the Department will be able to do as desire in conformity with the law. A final answer will be given by the time you reach here. Nothing has been heard from Sherman to-day.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 5, 1864.

If the Veteran Reserve regiment now at Rock Island can be spared, sent it immediately to Washington. An Iowa regiment at Davenport will be sent to Rock Island as soon as it is completed.
