General Steedman has directed Whitaker to drive the enemy across the Chickamauga in the morning, if possible. In the mean time he awaits orders relative to Mitchell's brigade. I inclose herewith a communication from General Wagner concerning the capture of a forage train by rebels.* Please send General Steedman orders about Mitchell's brigade.
