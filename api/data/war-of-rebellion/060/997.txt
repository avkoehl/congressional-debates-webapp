Washington, April 27, 1864.

The following order is republished for the information of all concerned:

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, Numbers 16. April 7, 1863.

The destruction of fences in the counties of Prince William, Loudoun, Alexandria, and Fairfax, Virginia, renders it necessary, for the cultivation of the land, that all farm stock should be confined or properly herded. It is accordingly ordered that stock found running at large, and not sufficiently herded, shall be seized and turned over to the provost-marshal, to be disposed of as the general commanding may direct, and the number and value thereof reported to these headquarters. Stock not herded or watched, so as to prevent their trespassing upon cultivated lands, will be regarded as running at large, and seized accordingly.

By command of Major-General Augur:

C. H. RAYMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
