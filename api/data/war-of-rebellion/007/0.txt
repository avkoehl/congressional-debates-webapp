On the 8th of June my regiment was engaged in the center, on the left, and supporting the Baltimore Light Artillery. Soon after getting into position, I was attacked by regiment slightly to my left. I changed position and drove them back. In a short time another regiment came up, and got behind a fence some 300 yards from me. This place they obstinately held for an hour. I could not charge them, not having 175 men in ranks, and having to cross a branch, a ravine, and a fence. At last, however, I drove them out, leaving some dead and quantities of arms, accouterments, and blankets. Soon after, another regiment was brought up the road, a little to my right, but my men dispersed them rapidly.

No other attack was made on this point during the day. The enemy had a piece of artillery, some 800 yards distant, the whole time, playing on me with grape, but when our rifles sent the last attacking regiment back, it retired. A demonstration was before that made on my left, but the force retired without effecting anything. About 4 to 5 o'clock my ammunition gave out, and the guns became so hot and foul as to be seriously impaired. Major-General Ewell then ordered me back for a new supply, and my regiment did not get into action again. There was no move made on my wing after I left, for I came back myself, and, under General Ewell's orders, pushed Colonel Patton's and Colonel Hays' commands forward on our extreme left.

Our loss was severe. Brigadier General George H. Steuart, in command on the left, and of my regiment and the battery, was shot, toward the close of the engagement, in the shoulder, severely, but not dangerously. His acting assistant adjutant-general, Lieutenant [Frank A.] Bond, and his aide, Lieutenant Randolph [H.] McKim, each had horses wounded. Second Lieutenant H. [H.] Bean, Company I, was wounded, and 24 men. I subjoin a list.* Two men were wounded in the battery.

It is my duty to notice the precision and gallantry with which Captain Brockenbrough served his guns.

I was not under fire on the 9th, but lost 1 man wounded, Private [Joshua] Simpson, Company D, who was fighting with the Fifty-second Virginia.

Your obedient servant,

PREPARED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR, BY BVT. Lieutenant Colonel ROBERT N. SCOTT, THIRD U. S. ARTILLERY,

AND

PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO ACT OF CONGRESS APPROVED JUNE 16, 1880.

SERIES I - VOLUME VII.

WASHINGTONGOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.

1882.

PREFACE.

By an act approved June 23, 1874, Congress made an appropriation "to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies," and directed him "to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order."

Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16, 1880, has provided "for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Records (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year"; and that "of said number, 7,000 copies shall be for the use of the House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments."*

This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.

---------------

*Volume I to V distributed under act approved June 16, 1880. the act approved August 7, 1882, provides that -

"The boluses of the official records of the war of the rebellion shall be distributed as follows: One thousand copies to the executive departments, as now provided by law. One thousand copies for distribution by the Secretary of War to such libraries, organizations, and individuals as hay be designated by the Senators, Representatives, and Delegates of the Forty-seventh Congress. Each Senator shall designate not exceeding twenty-one of such addresses, and he volumes shall be sent thereto form time to time as they are published, until the publication is completed. Senators, Representatives, and Delegates shall inform the Secretary of War in each case how many volumes of those heretofore published they have forwarded to such addresses. The remaining copies of the eleven thousand to be published, and all sets that may not be ordered to be distributed as provided herein, shall be sold by the Secretary of War for cost of publication with ten per cent. added thereto, and the proceeds of such sale shall be covered into the Treasury. If two or more sets of said volumes are ordered to the same address the Secretary of War shall inform the Senators, Representatives or Delegates, who have designate. The Secretary of War shall report to the first session of the Forty-eighth Congress what volumes of the series heretofore published have not been furnished to such libraries, organizations, and individuals. He shall also inform distributes at whose instance the volumes are sent."

---------------

The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:

The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed, is to be accompanied by an Atlas.

In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &amp;c., not embraced in the "report" proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.

The 2nd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

The 3rd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the fist and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities.

The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and confederate authorities given in that series.
