Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant General, Monterey, Tenn.:

General Curtis reports about 4OO rebels at Maysville, ARK, under Colonel Coffee, and the Pike force at Boggy Bayou; that these forces are to unite with others from Price and check Doubleday's forces from Kansas. In consequence of the attacks on trains General Curtis has sent a regiment of cavalry through from Batesville to Houston and hopes that our gunboats will soon enable steamers to supply him up White River. He is 23O miles from Rolla, out of bread, but has plenty of beef. General Schofield sent to-day two companies of State troops to Rolla.

BATESVILLE, VIA POCAHONTAS, May 28, l862.

Brigadier General W. SCOTT KETCHUM:

GENERAL: I am credibly informed a rebel gunboat(Kentucky) arrived at Little Rock Saturday. It is also reported that twenty steamers with troops are on White River, near Des Are. This is uncertain. Are they friends or foes? Have sent down expedition on White,which ought to report facts soon. A reconnaissance in force, which I ordered beyond Searcy, extended to Bayou Des Are and below West Point. Fifteen miles beyond Little Red River found small pickets, which were attacked and drove off. A rebel lieutenant (Halt) was taken prisoner and one of the enemy was wounded. One of the First Missouri Cavalry was wounded. As ordered, the parties returned to this side of Little Red River. My flank being exposed to river movements, it is of great importance for me to know any changes that occur in the Mississippi, and especially the success or failure of our gunboats. Provisions and forage grow terrible scarce, and I am anxious to get news. Another attack is reported on my supply train, 23 miles from Rolla.
