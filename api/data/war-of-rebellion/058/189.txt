Major-General SLOCUM:

Your letter inclosing instructions to Colonel Ketcham received. Colonel Mizner telegraphs that 1,400 of Roddey's men, under Johnson and Morrow [Moreland?], crossed Tennessee River between Florence and Clifton on Monday, designing raid on railroad. Be upon your guard.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

Cavalry might by quick marches strike supplies within a day and a half's march from river.

Yours truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
