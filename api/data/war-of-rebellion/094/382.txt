HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,December 27, 1864-5 p.m.

Major General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to forward the above copy of a dispatch* sent last night, inasmuch as he has received no answer thereto as yet. He also directs me to say that he is extremely desirous to have you destroy Bear Creek bridge, if possible. Major General A. J. Smith is in Pulaski to-day, and will start with his command early to-morrow morning for the Tennessee River and Eastport, which latter it is hoped he will be able to reach before the enemy.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
