The Wabash K5 a reserved public highway, by
a compact between the United States and the
Commonwealth of Viigni'a,at the time that Vir-
ginia ceded the JNoitli western Tm'tory to the
Umt"d States, and by an ordinance of Congiess,
of 13th July, 17b7, the fointh arae'e of this ordi-
nance co icludes thus "The navigable wateis
' leading into the Mississippi and St Lawrence,
' and hc#cdrryin° places 1 ltwi.cn the same, shall
'be common highways, and fotevei fiee, as well
'to the inhabitants of the said Tenitoiy as to
' thf citizens ot trie United States, and those of
'any other State mat may be idnittid into the
' Confederacy, without any tax, impost or duty
' the-efore " Heie is en oidinuice of Cm giefs
older than the Constitution, is embiaced m, and
lias become part of, the Constitution, and it gives
powei to improve the nvtis
By an act of 2d Mirch, 1327, Congress gi anted
lands to aid m constiuc nig a canal, to connect, at
nav tgable points, the watt rs of the Wabash with
those of Lake Erie, and lcseivcd the right to +he
United States to tianspoit tioops and mumt ons
of war on that canal ftec of any chaige Tins
canal is now in lapid piogrLSs of (onstuiction
It lies within the limits of two States, occupying
what was the princ pal eaiiying place, betwten
the Mississippi and ,the St Lawrence, at the
time of foimmg the act of cession and ordinance
above mentioned, the United States having ro-
se! vid the light to use both our nui aid canal,
free of any chdige Can it, then, be unreasonable
01 unconstitutional foi the Gcneial Government
to impiove the navigation of the nvei > I think
not
At the point where this appropna ion is to be
expended,   the W ibash  is   the  line  of demar-
cation In tween the Sutes of Indiana and Illinois
Each of these States has made an appiopnuion
to aid in improving the lapids, but these  young
States have not the ability to complete the w oik
Indiana has contiacted a debt of neailj half a mil
lion in the piosecution of hei  cana!, and it will
piobably be necessaiy to double thitdeht within
the ptesent year, and our people very natuially,
and 1 th nk veiy piopeil) , look to  the Genenl
Government, the gieat landholder in the West,
to lcimpiove these lapids with the money of the
nation, as   it  will  evidently  benefit the   whole
countiy
The State of Indiana pays into the United
States Treasury as laige a sum, as a tax or duty
on goods ívgpoitcd fiom foreign matkets, and
consumed by her citizens, as any State in the
Union of the same population, besides what her
inhabitants pay foi the public lands bought for
cultivation She has no harbors to improve, ex-
cept that of Tiail cicek, on Lake Mic-iiigvn, no
breakwaters to draw millions fiom the Tuasury
in then constiuction She asks nothing but the
improving ot her uvers ivo session of Congress
passes but othei States aie piovided with money
to improve their nveis The Hudson, James,
Savannah, Red, and Cumbeilaiid river", with a
long list of lessei streams that I w ill not detain the
Senate to lead, have all been impioved at the
expense oí the Geneial Government
At the session of Congicss of 1831 '32, a bill
passed, mid wuo appioud, providing Joi improving
the Monongabela and other rivers, to places where
there were no ports of entry* and the Globe, m
apologizing for that approval, says "If the pur-
' poses contemplated bj. Congress can be accom-
' phshed, and the thiee rweis mentioned made
' navigable to the points in question, then ports
' of entry will of course be ostabh^ied at the head
' of navigation " I ask, why not be so liberal to
the Wabash > It is a laiger river than th  Mo-
noiigahela—watering a much nioie extensive
teintory, of the finest soil in the woild, with a
i greatei population to be provided for
To «-how what has  been  done   elsewhere, I
I have procured <t statement showing the  appro-
ptiations of 1832 and 1834, for improving har-

stituents  will íemain forever silent under such
encumstances-'    I do not mean, Mi   Pitbident,
. to chatge the Chief Mag strait   with intfntional
| lnjustiiL, but only to svy , th it he has acted ui der
a ni'SUken ippichension of the facts, which has
¡ woikcd injustice to my constituents
j      I have recently been taught that a system is
I practiced to ki ep men silent that aie disposed to
speak out     When C inguss adjourned last sum
mer, I addressed a cnculai to my constituents,
-  T h appropriation is for the improvement of tile Mo

informing them of what had been done for their
benefit, and what was left undone, but said noth-
ing flattering of the treatment that the Wabash
bill had met with, and concluded by adv ising the
people to correct these wrongs at the ballot-box.
After the publication of my circulai, the Globe, a
newspapci printed in this city, devoted three or
four of its long columns m abusing me, because
I har] dated thus to address my constituents. But,
sir, I do not feel injured by this attack of the
Glol* The writer m that paper must establish
a charac*t rfoi tiuth ard veiacity among the peo-
ple of Indi ma, bcfoie they will take lus woid
against one they have known long and known well.
1 he writer of the article referí ed to has mistaken
his man, if he thinks that I can be hshed into
silence, foi the powei of the press, nor no other
pov/er, can intimidate or will keep me silent while
the inteiestof Indiana is at stake, and in this case
of the Wabash bill I contend that justice has not
been meted out to hei
A Piesident, or other public officer, is but a
tiansient being—here to day, gone to-monow,
but the principles of justice, upon which our
Government should be administered, aie immuta-
ble, and will endure m all time to come Every
Dubhcman owesaheavy responsibility to his con-
stituents, and I would have felt unworthy tne
trust reposed m me, if I had remained sile,u on a
subject so deeply interesting to those I have the
lionoi, m part, to represent here.
The term of service of the present Chief Magis-
trate is drawing to a close, what he has done, he
has done, it must go down to postenty to form
his political character, and God knows that I n  d
not, if I could, pluck a laurel fiom his biow, but,
sir, this subject of improving our livers cannot
rest heie, the people should take it into then own
hands, and in selecting a successor for the present
incumbent, befoie they cast their votes, they
should ascertain whethei he is foi or against in-
ternal improvement No, sn, that is too broad
a teim, it cai be explained away or constiued to
mean an/thing or nothing, They should know
whethei the candidates aie for oi against improv-
ing the navigation of our rivers, and I avei that
no men holding the opposite doctrine need expect
one fourth of oui votes
I hope, sn, that this resolution will be adopted,
and that both Congress and the President w.ll
agree that the United States should improve this
nvei I cannot believe, without more evidence
than is now before me, that there's a disposition
in eithei to prevent it when the question is piop-
eily undeistood."
*As Mr Tipton's remarks, made on the floor
of the Senati, implicating thp character of our
press, have the advantage of a place in the Con-
gressional Globe, as part of the debate, we feel
bound to submit the refutation through the same
channel Tf we c mnot meet oui honoi able assail-
ants where they tike the privilege of making their
