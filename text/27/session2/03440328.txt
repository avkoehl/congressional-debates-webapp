CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
rods, and o¡ the greatest importance He conceived nothing
«ouldbeofa more momentous, weighty, or grave character,
than the system of policy laid down in the series of resolutions
Wljtich. had been submitted by hia distinguished friend from
Kentucky s They were particularly opportune, for he thought
it full nine to look the difficulties" of the country m the face
Nearly four monthe-of the present session of Congress had pasb
«d over as useless discussions, without any thing being done.for
the relief of-thecountry, and, he was sorry to say, he feared
four more would elapse before any thing practical would be
effected
The mam object of these resolutions seemed to him to be,
to raise raaans sufficient for the administration of the Govern
ment Thegreat question wae, what the wants of the Govern
ment were to be for the coming year, and for succeeding years
Some gentlemen opposite had assumed that the expenditures
ought to be brought down to seventeen mUhona, but he had
never«een the practicability of that assumption demonstrated
The ¡Senator from New Hampshire [Mr Woodbury] the other
day, had, indeed, offered a table ot reductions, but if he, (Mr
Evans,) had time to go into particulate, he could easily de
monsüatethxU not one hall of those i eductions could be made
He a iverted to a few of the i ems a! hided to by the Senator, and
among them, «elected for comment, the proposition to reduce
the expenditures fot the Florida war tne million thiee hundred
thoub&au" dollars, leaving but five hundred thousand dolían  to
pay arrears and cany oi the war He denied that any such
reduction was practicable It would take moie than the ba
lance to pay what is due, and notta ng would be left to prose
cute the war The same might be said with i egard to other
reductions proposed by the Senator
Payment*, were to be made this year in dischaige of claims
on the General Government authorized by Congress to he [ aid
to the States, amounting to one million six hundied thousand
dollar?, and there were many other new sources of expendí
tures for the ensuing year, which wou d more than countei
balance the sum which the Senator assumes can be retrenched
Instead of a reduction of nearly eight million*, as supposed by
the Senator the most thatcouldbe done in any case would be
to reduce that amount to four millions, and these reductions
taken off, would leave the expenditures twenty two millions—
precisely the point at which the resolutions under discussion
assume that the expenditures ought to slop
Mr Evans then we it into a review of the expend lures of
the late Administration, and contended that m many instances
the reductions made ifere not retrenchments, but postpone
mente 1 hete postponements he considered nothing but ne
glector abandonment of dutiesofGovernmtnt Ifthesamedu -
tie  were performed for the year 1810 as for preceding years,
tne expenditures would have been twenty five millions He
cdntended that the ¿neatest real letrtnchment of 184U over 1839
was minternal impiov«ments, the .nvingon which was only
rune hundied th usand dollars The piesent Administiation
had notmng of that kind left to refienth
Another reduction made m It 40 was <*i\ bundled thousand
dolíais on pen ions Headmitud tint the falling m of pensions
1or the ensuing vear ought to amount to a considerable leduc
«on Butthese, and a lew inconsumable item*, together with
tiie reform and retrenchments now actually in progiess would
notsenously affect the gross amount foi he would repeat now
"what he had ¡stated before, and what had been charged upon
him assaying by the Senator from South Carolina, that he did
riot see how the gross amount of the expenditures eouldbere
duced below twenty two millions This was independent of the
processgomg on for the diminution oi expenses in detail It
was said, why not make reductions in the ejipendituies for the
army? It might a" well be asked why not cut off all ex-
pense of that kind, by disbanding the army Retrench
ment is going on, but gentle neu ¿re impatient Why not
give time—why thus, duve fuiwaid ihp Government by occu

how theexpenditurescould be brought down below twenty two
millions indeed it was his belief that they could not be
bioughtdownto thatsum He should be entirely bati&fied if they
could be bvpught down to twenty three millions   The question,
then, was, how this sum was to be raised^ It was useless to re-
ly on Treasmy notes or loans, for the country was now in that
condition that no more could be borrowed lhe only thing
possible to be done Was to establish a sound, wholesome sys-
tem of tarifffor revenue The tables of exportsand imports
for some yeais have been so fluctuating that it is not easy
to make out any standard for calculation from
them He concurred with the mover of the resolutions,
under "hscussion, that the imports subject to duty could not be
calculated at more than ninety millions He next íeviewea ihe
calculation made by the Senator from South Carolina, [Mr
Calhoon,] yesterday
In the course ol his remarks in reference to the estimate of
articles to be free from duty undei the compromise act, Mr
Calhoun interposed for explanation, upon which the compro
mise act was referred to, and a short running discussion en
«med in the cuu seof which Mr Clay interfered, to sty that
1 e would, in his reply, advert to that particular subject but
that he would now content himself with asserting, in the mo&t
positive man er, that no such limitation of free artices as the
Senator from South Caiolma «mpp bed, was irtended or autho
rizedby thecompiomise act, and that Congress had entire con
trol over the subject, wit' out vio'ationoftha' act
Mr Evans observed, in continuation, that he had heard so
many conflicting constiuctions of the compromise act, that he
was mc ined to doubt what meaning should be given to its pro
visions an i would, therefore, pa«i over that bianch of the sub
jeet He then pioceeded to calculations, with a view of asc^r
taming theba^is ofrevenue He had coi strutted tables oi im
port*, for two periods of ten years pach first, from 1820 to 1S29
inclusive «iiid then fiom 1R30 to 1840 mclu ive The aegie
gate of exports for the first period was ©520 0.00 000 making
fifty two millions annually for the second peno 1 the aggregate
expoi s were seven hundred and ninety millions averaging

lions mnually, of the seem d period nine hundred an 1 eighty

the excess of exports was two hundred and sixty *ix mi! ions,
or twenly six millions annuilly, the excessof imports for the
same period was three hundreu and eighty one millions, or thirty
eight millions Theincreaseof exports beyond the relative in-
crease of population for the two periods was nine per cent, but
the íelativemcreaseof imports was forty percent The differ-
