Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Regiment ordered to be in readiness to march at a moment's notice from Washington this morning. Destination unknown, supposed Wheeling. S. W. Spratt arrived from Harper's Ferry. Says there are 7,000 troops there; 500 on Maryland Heights, but no cannon; mostly Marylanders. Two batteries on VIRGINIA side. Thinks movement will be made on Ferry, also sustain unionists Northwestern Virginia. Lee ordered 2,000 troops to Ferry to- day. Thinks it impossible to hold Ferry without 	Maryland Heights. Should Letcher order their evacuation troops will refuse obedience.
