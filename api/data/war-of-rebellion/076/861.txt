I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The Yankee infantry is moving across my front in the direction of Sweet Water bridge in front of General Armstrong. Their line of skirmishers, which appears to be out merely for the protection of their flanks while moving, are in full view of my pickets, who report that their knapsacks are plainly visible. What amount of force is moving I cannot discover. You may be able to form some estimate of the force from the length of time they may be passing, which I will report as soon as it is done moving by.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General, &c.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy are advancing in my front once more with heavy line of skirmishers, before which my line is being slowly driven back. I cannot decide how large the force is in rear of the skirmish line, but it is at least a brigade of infantry. The line of skirmishers extends to my left beyond my farthest vedettes, and I suppose to General Armstrong's front, as they can be heard that far. At this moment their advance is checked. My skirmishers are, however, not more than 100 yards in advance of my line.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Please ascertain as soon as possible what force is before you, and where the left of the enemy's infantry is, and as well as you can what force is in our front here.

Respectfully,

J. E. JOHNSTON.
