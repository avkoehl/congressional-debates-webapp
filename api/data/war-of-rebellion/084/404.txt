DEVALL'S BLUFF, July 26, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER:

I hear nothing new from the enemy. The standing detail for the Remount Camp is four squadrons. It is now furnished from the Third Michigan, the commanding officers of which reports that he cannot furnish the picket for to-morrow. Seventy soldiers have died here during the nineteen days I have been here, but the health of the troops has improved within the part ten days. I ordered Doctor Foote, medical director for the division, over here, but I understand Surgeon Weeks thinks he is needed more at Little Rock, and directs him to remain there.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.
