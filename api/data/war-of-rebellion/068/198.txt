DREWRY'S BLUFF, May 16, 1864.

GENERAL: It is 5.45 p. m. The enemy have been driven from our right to south side of Proctor's Creek and east of railroad; also from our immediate vicinity on turnpike. I am organizing combined attack on line of Proctor's Creek, and hope good results. The movement has commenced, though late. We shall occupy the works on hill west of railroad. Nothing positive as to position of Whiting save the knowledge that he was at Port Walthall Station this morning at 10 o'clock.

Copy of telegram dated Drewry's, May 16, 1864, 9.30 p. m., received May 16, 1864, 10.50 p. m., viz:

The approach of darkness made it imprudent to execute this evening the plan set forth in my dispatch of 5.45 p. m. It will be prosecuted without variation, commencing at daylight to-morrow and I hope to have the co-operation of General Whiting. Have sent several dispatches to urge it.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General BRAGG.

Respectfully submitted to the Adjutant-General for his information.

Copy of telegram dated Hancock's house, 2 1/2 miles north of Walthall Junction, via Drewry's Bluff, May 17, 1864, 11 p. m., received May 17, 1864, viz:

The enemy has retired to his lines across the Neck; our forces are in position in his front. His lines of skirmishers will be driven about daybreak to-morrow to determine location and strength of his works. A battery of field rifled pieces has been ordered to be constructed at Howlett's to command the James River, so as to prevent his passage of transports. The junction with Whiting's forces was made about midday. They formed my right wing.
