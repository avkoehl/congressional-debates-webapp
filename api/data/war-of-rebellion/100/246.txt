GENERAL: Finding that General Johnston has surrendered his army, of which my command forms a detached part, I have the honor to surrender the command, with the request that the same terms be allowed us as were given to General Johnston's army.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MOREHEAD CITY, April 18, 1865.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Raleigh:

Troops are constantly arriving here for your army. Eleven hundred and fifty have just arrived belonging to the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps and the cavalry. Do you want them sent to the front? It will be necessary for them to march if supplies are to go forward. I have about thirty days' grain on hand for your army and a good deal of clothing and some quartermaster' stores. Do you think it worth while for me to send for more clothing and quartermaster's property?

L. C. EASTON,

Chief Quartermaster.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 18, 1865.

General EASTON:

Dispatch received. Let the troops march up to New Berne and there await orders. You may now send forward forage and provisions, and only enough clothing for immediate wants. I have no doubt that I have this day made terms with Johnston that will close the war and leave us only to march home. A month's supply on hand is ample.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
