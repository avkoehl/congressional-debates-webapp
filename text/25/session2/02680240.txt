hand which could best do it assuaged the bitter
pains of parting life The lastearthlysounds which
fell upon his ear were tones of sympathy, and kind-

ceased not, even when Ihey vainly süove to pieroe

self-sacrificing affection, triumphing ovci exhaust-

been spared to the friends who now deplore Ins
death, and to the State and to the countiy whieh
he served. To that stricken bosom we proffer—

The following preamble and resolutions, prepai-
ed m accordance with the instructions of a commit-
tee appointed at a preparatory meeting, were offer-
ed for the consitleration of the meeting, who testifi-
ed then approbation of the sentiments contained m
them, by repeated applause, and they were adopted
without one dissenting voice
Whereas, By the 8th section of the first article
of the Constitution of the United States, Congress
his power " to levy and collect taxes, duties, im-
posts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide toi
the common defence and general welfare of the
United State' " " To borrow money on the eiedit
of the United States " " To coin money, regulate
the \ alue thereof, and of foreign com " " To pio-
vide for the punishment of counterfeiting the secu-
rities, and current coin of the United States "
And whereas, By the 1th section of the same
article, it is provided that " no money shall be
drawn ft om the Treasury, but in consequence of
appropriation made by law, and a regular state-
ment and account of the receipts and expenditures
of all public money shall be published fiom time to
time "
And whereas, by the tenth section, it is ilso pio-
vided that ' no State shall coin money," " and the
nett pioduce of all duties and imposts laid by any
State on imports or expoits shall be for the use of
the Tieasuiy of the United States," all of which con-
stitutional provisions relating to the receipts and
expenditures of the United Stales, and particulaily
those defining money to be coin, and giving the
entire regulation of it to the National Government,
show incontestibly that the only money to be  c-
cewed by the United Stales was the hard money,
the metallic currency, gold and silver coin, which,
in all agfs and countries, has been univeisally re-
cognised as money on account of its teal and intrin-
sic value, and that there was to be an actual Trea-
sury of the United States, mio which the money was
to be paid, and from which it could only be drawn
and paid out m consequence of app'opnations made
by law
And whereas, the frameis of the Constitution,
and those who enacted the early statutes on ihe
subject, in the emphatic language of Darnel Weh-
%ttr, "were hird mom y men, they had felt, and
therefore fully appreciated, the evils of apapei me-
dium, they therefore sedulously guarded the cur-
rency of the United States from debasement The
legal currency of the United Stales was gold and silver
coin "
And whereis, in accordance with these views
the first collection act passed 31st Tuly, 1789, di-
rected the duties and fees to be collected by virtue
of it, to "be received tn gold and silvei com only," and
the act to establish the Treasury Department, pass-
ed the 2d September, 1789, made it the duty of the
Treasmer to "receive and keep the moneys of the
United States," and to disburse the same "in the
manner pointed out by that act "
And whereas, at the adoption of the Constitution
cf the United States, the continental money of the
Revolution had long before passed out of circula-
tion, and by that noble instrument the States were
prohibited from emitting bills of credit, or making
any thing but gold and silver com a sender in pay-
ment of debts, and no bank was contemplated by
the General Government, for a provision intended
to give Congress the power to create one was
stricken, out of the proposed Constitution, and
there were but three State banks in existence ía
the whole country, namely, the Banks of North
America, Massachusetts, and New York, whose
notes or bills were never supposed to be the money
meant by the Constitution, either as a legal tender,
or as forming a part of the cuirent coin of the
United States, and whose vaults or safes were not
mentioned m that fundamental law, as being either
the Tieasury of the United States, or even as com-
ponent parts of it
And whereas, m violation of the clear and ex-
press terms and spirit of the Constitution, a Bank
of the United States was established which substi-
tuted its paper and that of its sisters, the State
banks, for the legal currency of the country, and
was followed by a temporary league with the State
hanks, which was succeeded by a new National
Bank, undei whose auspices ihe paper circulating
medium was extended far beyond all former
limits.
And whereas, not only was the legal currency of
the country changed, but the vaults of National or
State banks substituted for the constitutional Trea-
sury, and the money of the people, instead of re-
maining in the care of then agents, was loaned out
to the favorites of these great corporate bodies m>
direct defiance of the words and spirit of the Con-
stitution
And whereas, the people of the United States
having solemnly decided a second time, after a full
and dispassionate examination of ihe whole ques-
tion, thai a National Bank was "unconstitutional,
inexpedient, and dangerous," another temporary
league was formed with the State institutions, which
was dissolved forevei m May last, by their volunta-
ry declaiation that they would not, and could not,
fulfil the terms of their contract.
And whereas, this event has produced an entire
separation of Bank from State, and has placed the
nation in a position to restore the true meaning of
the Constitution, and with it the constitutional
Treasury contemplated by its framers, without the
slightest injustice or injury to any class or body of
individuals, and it is the clear interest of the people
that their íevenues should be collected, received,
kept and disbursed by their own officers, who are
dnectly responsible to them for all their aots.
Therefore,
Resolved, That this meeting does most cordially
approve the special and annual messages of the
President, proposing the restoration of the consti-
tutional Treaiury, and the entire and total separa-
tion forever of Bank and State, and of the bill re-
ported by the Hon Silas Wright in the Senate, in
pursuance of this íccommendation.
Resutved, That this cardinal measuie of Demo-
cratic policy has received the cordial and united
support of the Democracy of Pennsylvania, who
are firmly determined never to submit to the go-
vernment of irresponsible corporate bodies, whe-
ther State or National, foreign or domestic, or to the
domination of an upstart noneyed anstocraey
Resolved, That a Bank of the United States is
"unconstitutional, inexpedient, and dangerous,"
and will never he tolerated by the freemen of Penn-
sylvania.
Resolved, That a proposition to connect the Go-
vernment with twenty-five banks, by a solemn
league and a covenant, is m effect to select the mis-
called Bank of the United States of Pennsylvania,
which owes its existence to a direct violation of the
will of the people of this great State, with its
branches and agencies, and purchased and depen-
dent banks, as the depositories of the money of the
United States, and is only the first step towards a
recharter ef it as a national institution, which had
expired amidst the execrations of an outraged com-
munity
Resolvd, That the resolutions passed at Hams-
burg, in relation to the bill reported by the hono-
rable Silas Wright, to restore the constitutional
Treasury, were in open violation of the will of
the Democratic party of this State, and of a ma-
jority of the people of Pennsylvania, and were
carried by the votes of a few Democrats, who must
