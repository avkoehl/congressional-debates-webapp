[Here Mr. Walker quoted the tables of im-
ports and exports during th* yeais of expansion
and contraction, and showed conclusively mat they
were entirely governed by the Bank operations on
tie cnriency ]
Another importent effect produced by 'his ma-
chine for producing an ebb and flow of currency
wis that if governing a"nd controlling the receipts
of the public Treasury The Board of Bank Di-
rectors can at all times control ihe public revenue;
they can say how much or how 1 tue shall come
in erhow much shall be kept out of the Treasury.
It is desirable *hnn tne Secietary of Ihe Treasury
makes out h   estimate*, that h  should be able as
nearly as possible to calcula e on the probable
receipts from customs After he has mads
his estimotes, and Coo^re s has acted on them
m us appiopiiaiK ns, thrse Bank directors
moy older a ron'ract on, and not allow the
customs to yield half the e Umates, thus com-
pelling Govemme t to call a new session to pro-
vide sor the defie ency.
Thus it is es entially necessory, not alone for the
p*op!e to be made acquainted m advance of the m-
le 1 'ed niovemen's of ih sgiea' revolutionizing ma-
chine, but that the Execu'ive officers of the Go-
vctnoient should be apprised of the proposed ex-
plosions and contractions, wuh a view of making
up his estnm'es accordingly Ought not Congress,
a d those who managed the finances of the Go-
vernment, to know something of mese orders of
council—Bnlish ord'rs in courcil, as they might
jjstij be call d—emanating from a body predis-
posed, fri m the ^abi o of the cl^s and party, to
subm * to Bruish inrlüerce, b A further bound to if,
by ih° fact that th y were but the instruments to

deiive its means from British capital, and would,

neyed power which had its centre oí gravity at
