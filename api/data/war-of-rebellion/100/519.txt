Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have telegraphed to General Schofield to send a special messenger immediately to Washington. Colonel Cutts is absent on special duties. Moreover, he can reach General Schofield only by sea, by which time the papers should be hald way to Washington under my telegraph orders to General Schofield, which have been repeated this morning. The Beverly Tucker papers, found at Hunter's house, left by special messenger yesterday morning; the Sanders papers also by special messenger the day before. Everything of this kind will be forwarded to the War Department as speedily as possible.
