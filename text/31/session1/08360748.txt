King, Whittlesey, Haymond, Hall, and Lit-
tlefiti.d, to act as tel ers.
TV1 \ ROBINSON" withdrew the nomination of
A. J. Glossbrenner. He remarked that he had
put him in nomination without hi & consent. He
had done so under the belief that he was the only
person who was likely to command the entire
Democratic vote. Finding, however, such was
not the case, and that a majority of the parly
seemed to prefer Judge Young, he would with-
draw his name. He hoped that the <^her candi-
dates would be withdrawn to secure the election of
Judge Young:, for whom he intended to vote.
