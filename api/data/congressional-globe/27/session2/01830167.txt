was attached, he felt bound to state his views upon the resolu-
tion now before the Senate     the substantial usurpado  of
power had been in the hands of Congress, who had taken upon
themselves the prerogative of regulating the industry oí the
country, thereby affecting even the spinning wheels west of the
mountains, and they had also coostiucted roads and canals,
which had been converted into a means of increasing the power
of the Executive   The power assumed by Congress to construct
roads and canals with moneys from the National Treasnry, was
an usurpation, and consequently converted mto a means for
increasing Executive patronage and power    Whatevei powers
Congress assumes  which it has no legitimate right to exercise
under the Constifution, tends to give ihe Executive power to
the same extent to control and subjugate the legislative branch
of;the Government, and the people    Usurpation begins with
Congress natuially and essentially    Whatever might be the
moral truththat "the majority did and must govern," it was not
true as applied to this Government    This1 was not a Govern
mem of a majority, but a retractive Government of checks and
balances,* and the Senate was an illustration of it    They who
represented the smaller Statts were called upon to reject the
idea that this was a Government of majorities, foi if it were not
for these checks they could not continue as a Union    That a
majority must rule wa¡= not true with regaid to this body, they
were not elected by the people, but by the States and elected
far beyond the term of serviré of the President of the United
States, and he considered ihis as one of the beauties of this Go
vernment, and a wise consideration and one of the lucky hits
of our ancestors    The House of Representatives wa& consti
tuted with relerenca to State distinctions    In truth, there was
only one depaitment of the Government that was truly Demo
cratic, and that was the Executive    So far from the President
being in a position to contravene the popular will, he \4jfMhe
only-officer that came in on the broad basis of the whole Umon,
and was therefore the proper exponent of the popular will
The Senate was the only arihtociatic body, and stood between
the popular will and the Execut ve
/      The Executive was elected by the  people of the United
States, and was the only representative tí at was not, m the na
ture and design of the Constitution, elected with regard to any
particular section    The delegation of the other House were
sectional, the President was not, \nd, in   one sense, wa.s voted
for by the whole people, and as \ co ordinate bianch of the Go-
vernment    ThePiesideut was elected foi four years, the Sena-

who were called upon to Irame the Constitution acquiesced in
it, and in all the debates m theStattb wheit conventions weie

cases    What-aid the eioquentPatnck Henry?    He seaicely
devoted a word to u, and of ill the powers in the Constitution,
this one seemed to pass the least contested    He held the period
to be past when they could amend the f oribiitiUton, except fu
gross evils which could not bedvoidedby incident ú legislation,
and   that   instrument should   not he touched but with the
greatest caution    Let the Constitution stand wheie it was it

prospetity of the country?   Could not they get along with it as

But what  was   the   excuse   of   this    powei?    Gentlemen

MjTj APAM§ rose and pioceeded to state? that, at the time
he was arrested on Saturday, he was reading from a newspaper
a letter purporting to com^from a gentleman, a member of
this Ho use——•
Mr ANDREWS of Kentucky inquired of the Speaker whe
ther, after the vote of Saturday, the gentleman fiom Massa
chusetts[Mr Adaj*s] could be allowed to proceed without a
vote of the House?
Mi ADAMS said he stood hete an accused man, and he
insisted that the order of the House itseli had admitted the
fact
Mr MALLOltY inquired of the Speaker if this was m
ordei?
Mr ANDREWS asked the decision of the Speaker on his
question
The SPEAKER, after going with some detail into the pout
of order, and his decision thereon on Saturday, (which decision
had been reversed by the Hou'e,) road the following rule
"If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgress the
rultsof the House, the Speaker shall, or any member may,
call to order, in which case, the member so called to ordei
shall immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain, and
the House shall, if appealed to, decide on the case, but without
debate if there be no appeal, the decision of the Chair shall be
submitted to If the decision be in favor of the member called
to order, heshall be at liberty to proceed, ?fothenou>et he shall
not be permitted to proceed, in case any member object with
out leaxe of the Borne "
Ihe SPEAKER remarked also that the Chan had not or Sa
turday been disposed to arrest the gentleman from Massachu
setts although he had been called to order The decision of
the Chair had been overruled by the House The gentleman
from Kentucky [Mr Andrews] objected to the gentleman from
Massachusetts [¡Mr Adam-.] pioceedmg without leave of the
House, and, under this decision, the Chair had no alternative
but to enforce the rule
Mi flLLMOREj at this stage of the proceedings, rose and
asked leave of the House to report the appropriation bills from
the Committee of Ways and Means, no opportunity havmgyet
been piesented to do so in order
Mr WISE objected until the question before the House had
been fully settled
Othei membeis also objecting, the leave was ro granted
Mi   WISE moved that the gentleman horn Massachusetts
[Mi   Adamsj be permitted to pioceed under the leave of the
House granted to him
Mr STEENROD (simultaneously with Mr ANDREWS
and other members) asked the jeasand nays, which were or
dered
Mr STAN I Y.dfsired tn be informed whethei the gen leman

Mr A>.DPvEv\-3 of Kentucsy was umW«topd to ca'l upon
the Speaker to decide whethei this was a privileged question
or not
The SPEaKCR decided that it was for the House, and not
for the Speaker, to decide whether it was a question of prinlega
or not
Mi WARREN demanded that the motion of the gentle-
man from Virginia [Mr Wise] should be reduced to writing,
m order that the House might distinctly understand what it was
about
The SPEAKER requested Mr Wise to reduce his motion to
writing
And Mr WISE proceeded to do so,
Pending which—
Mr TRIPLETT submitted to the Chair that the Sppafce*
could not waive the decision of the question, whether thia was
a privileged question or not
The SPEAKER replied that questions of privilege were
always questions foi the House, and not for the Chair, to
decide
Mr BOTTS rose and made a remark not heard by the Re-
porter.
Mt CAMPBELL of South Carolina was unders'ood to take
an appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr PICKENS denied, in the most emphatic manner, that it
was for the Speaker to decide the question of privilege It was
one of the highest privileges of this House to do so
Mi SAUNDERS was understood to move to lay Mr Ca&P
bell's appeal on the table
Mi WISE thereupon submitted his motion, in wining, m
the following form
"The House havyig allowed Mr. Adams, by its vo% to defend
himself from a charge contained in a papei Oi petition m his
possession, and to read a portion of a lettei of Mr Wise to
prove that he (Mr W ) had also made the same or a similar
chaige, and to comment upon that portion of the letter, Mf,
Wise now asks the privilege and the permission of the House
to reply to the remarks of Mr Adams, and to speak in his own
defence and to the question of privilege raised by Mr Adams.
Mr WARREN desired to move an amendment
Mr UNDERWOOD raided the point of order that the motion
of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] could not be re-
ceived or entertained without a suspension of the rule, and of
the regular ordei ofhosmes&
The SPEAKER overruled the point of order
Mi WIfcEiepeated that he made th&motion asa point of pri-
vilege
Mr UNDERWOOD appealed fiom the above decision, and
sustained the appeal in a few remarks, (yielding the floor for a
moment to Mr Cushing )
The SPEAKER here said that the appeal was not de-
batable
Mr STAJSHCA wag understood to expiess a desire to amend
the papei sent to the Ctiair                   %
The SPEAKER said that was not the question immediately
befoiethe House
The question, "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
judgment of the House?" was then taken and decided m the
aflirmative—ayes 118, noes notcoun ed
So the decision oí the Chair was affirmed
