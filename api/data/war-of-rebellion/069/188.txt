do not know. Yours of 6.05 received. My skirmishers extend to the river, not my line of battle. If I had a squadron of cavalry here I could use them to take care of my left flank and dispense with this line of skirmishers, besides they would be in a very good position to attack the enemy should he advance on the left, which, however, is not likely. Everything is right, now and then a shot only.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, May 25, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: Yours of 8.45 is received. I regret to find my dispositions do not suit you. The right of my front line does strike the railroad in front of General Barlow's left, as shown in the sketch, and my men are now engaged in intrenching.

MAP.

A work is now being put up at A, to extend over toward General Barlow's, and I have sent two regiments of McKeen's brigade to occupy the position B. My skirmish line connects with General Barlow's. My front line can be withdrawn on the right if you desire it, but I respectfully submit that as it is in presence of the enemy it would be better to allow it to remain there and make the connection as I propose, as I have another strong line to the rear of the right of my line, the right resting on the railroad.

Respectfully,JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
