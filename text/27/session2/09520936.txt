amendments recommended by the Committee on
Finance.
Mr. EVANS hoped the Senate woold proceeá
with the amendments in their regular order.
The CHAIR annonnced the fi.st amendment to
be, to change ihe expression "the day and year
before mentioned," into "the passage ot this act."
Mr. EVANS pointed out that there were several
verbal amendments, to the same effect, throughout
tbe bill, the question: on which might be taken al-
together.
These amendments were adopted.
The next amendment was to substitute four
cents per square yard on cotton-bagging, or its sub-
stitute, imported, for /¡tie cents in the original bill.
Mr. WALKER moved to amend the amend-
ment by substituting " three" cents, for ' four "
Mr. BENTON made some remark, net distinct-
ly heard.
Mr. KING observed that th  effect of the high
duty pioposed wou'd be to exclude /rim this
•market every species of foreign cot'on baggmg.
This would then be a prohibitory du y Mj.-, hs
was willing that ihe bapgip? n.anufacturers <f
Kentucky and Missouri should have a fair protec-
tion, not detrimental to revenue, or to other indus-
trial interests of the country. He was wilbng to
let them enter ihe Southern market wi'h every ad-
vantage against foreign compeli'ion. Bat he
would not, for the purpose of meiely g visg a
bounty to a few individuals, consent lo lay f>n ex-
travagant duty, calculated to cut off all foreign
competition, and exclude altogether tht. foreign
fabric. Mr. K. read from a tabic, whica
he held in his hand, many statist'Cs to show
the quality and pnce of the foreign fab-
ric, contrasted with the domestic. He also
read a statement, prepared by no unfriendly hand
to protection, showing ihe comparative advantage
of high and low rates of duty. His own experi-
ence satisfied him that, under a í¿ir competition in
prices, Kentucuy bagging would always command
a preference in the Southern n aiket, as long as ihe
usually good article from, that S ate was ¡-rod ced.
Last year, in consequence of rivalry, an inferior
article was produced, and the in'ercs's of the Ken-
tucky bagging manufacturers suffered, because
they could not, as usual, command the pref-
erence in the market.
He stated that, in the neighbood of L'tusv.lle,
the old mode of spinning and weavicg by hand had
been superseded by machinery on an extensive
scale. Th" tfda"ed price in the Souibein market
is the effect <f tl is compeiition at houe between
machine lib >r aad band labor, and not from c m-
pention with th" foreign artic'e. The return, fur
1839 >ho-v that the price of Scotch biggin?, at the
place of manufacture, was twelve and a halt cents;
of English bagging, thirteen cents, raid of Russian,
fourteen oeais—the article being better than the
Seo'ch or English ll to these be added the charges
of li.prtrtaiion, ¡he foreign article cannot now,
even if free of doty, compete with Kentucky bag-
ging, manufactured by machinery, at a cost not
exceeding two or three cen's a yard, so loiig as
the lattPi article maintains, its quality, and ll ereby
crmn'artdi the m<irket. Kentucky bagging, manu-
factured by machinery, can now be sold at ten
cen's a yard, and leave as much p oflt to .he capi-
talist as fifteen or sixteen cents lor the ¿'tide rnan-
nfaciu'ed oy hand laoor It i< evident thai, ih a

if ihe Kentucky bagging can b? made for 10 cents,
and 'be foreign «rtic e cannot be made (or less
than 12i cents, (to which the cost of import must
be added)—whether it was reasonable to suppose
that a single yard of the foreign article would be
brought into market. Did not every one see that,
instead of the sum estimated by ihe Secretary of
the Treasury to be derived from bagging for rev-
enue, there would flot be one cent oí revenue ac-
cruing to the treasury, even at three cen's per
square yard duty?
Mr. MOB.EHEAD had not changed his opimors,
nor weie they likely to be changed by the observa-
tions of the Senator from South Carolina, that
thme cents duty would be prohibitory, and produce
no reve-ue; or of the Senator fren AlaHama, that
he w?s willing to protect the home manufactures,
provided it could be done without isterfenng with
levbnue. He could Sell both Sjnatois they were
m.staken; and that neither three cents n^r five cen's
woidd give adequate protection to the Kentucky
manufar'urrrs-
iMr EVANS ob<erved that this cbo'e ot bag-
gmsr had given infim e Iriub e b io.e, and seemed
to premier more no*-. He hop-d ro more lime
would te lost on it. Tnree whole (bys hid been

The qaestion was ¡hen taken on ftlr. Walker's
mofen .o sub*ti,ute 3 certs for 4, aru cegauved.
Mr. WALKER then moved to «uDs'itute 31
cents per yard, am' on th's he called the yeas and
nays.
The rale he not.' proposed was reported by the
Finance Commute , when the bill wis last before
ihe Senate. It wps the rate imposed by the act of
1832; and, uncier the compromise act, it continued
to tall, till it reached 2 9-10 cents.
The yeas smi na^s were then ordered.
After a few íemarks from Messrs EVANS
SIMMONS, BENTON. CRITTENDEN, CAL-
HOUN, WALKER, LINN, BUCHANAN, and

The next amendmen' v a1? lo chiSge the rjte of

' ¡>ndon was ¿£17 per U n fhe ¡,rjpoord d, t/ e>!
$17 per ton is less than 20 pel cent It is among
tne tery lowest of duties imposed by this  bill.
True, the Siate ot Mame a as largely concerned in
the duties on irer, steel, c< pper,h( mp,and cordagej
but, in a great measure of revenue like this, it was
impossible to look with a sirgle e>e to the effects
it would have on an individual S ate. He believed,
however, that those met nterested in the shipping
trade did not cjrrplain ef the^e dut'es. They
looked to tbe imprcvemeiit of trade fiom the im-
provement of the condition of the countrv.
Mr WILLIAMS conceiving his colleague's in-
formant n on tbU sub|ec irK.re likely to be correct
than h.s own, «a or Id say that if it <hoi,'d appear
that the duty would rot exceed 30 per cent., hs
would wrbdra'/hi   amendment.
Mr. SIMMONS otate 1, ¡rom a lelterin his hand,
that the puce of S «di'ii iron in 1834 was $84 per
t<n—ii.creasi"g jear'y to $100, and coming back
to $80 in 184.2. He íes i Irom this letter an opin-
ion that a iedu.c ion of two or three dollars a ten
m the dutv would only have the effect of raising
the fo.e gn price
Mr WOODBURY observed that it was true the
foreign iron, after paying the cosí, charges, and
du'y, wa , a' an average, over $60 per ton. But
the Rverage of recent vea^s wa? unJer JJ50 Every
rip could see th-.t $16 per lm day «vou'd exceed
25 per c nt  on the seeiage value now
?Jr SIMPSONS observed t'^at he understood th 
Six-a'ui f o,n Mame [Mr Wiliiams] bad said, if
the rn y d d ; it exceed 30 p"r cent, he would be
'atislrd w.ih it. Kov>, he would assure tbe Sena-
tor ti at $18 a ten duty wou'd not be 30 per
c^nt
F'r. WILLIAMS s?id he Ivd withdrawn his
amendment.
Mr. BUCHANAN s„,d it would become his
imperative duty at sim^ state ot this debate to say
a few cords in relajón to the duty upo  iron; and,.
pe'haps, there wouli5 not be a bet er time to do ' 
than at present His own State was deeply inter-
ested in the manufacture of this article; and yet, if
hp knew him-elf, he d'd not desire ore cent more
of duty iban lo enau'e the manufacturen to live.
He aesired on! ' a revenue cu'}, with the incidental
pro;tct'on wr ch that duly would afford The du-
ties rpon ear iron m the \e?rs 1839 and 1840
produced upwards of two m.ll.ono ot dollars per
annum. 1 he rale of e u>y heie proposed, then, he
was convinced, would not prevent the importation
of the article, it tht- Senator from Maine had
mrde his propositi >n for a reuuttion upon the next
article, it wou' 5 hive been nucb more reasonable.
A du.y of $17 a ton would not come up lo the
s'aidard of h s (r'erd fresa A'karsas—caoiely, 25
per cent Bjt, as to ihe condition cf his own
St,i,;, w, h ^shich he líeüreJ ihe Senate1 to be ae-
ouaii e¿: After tie 1? e var,  lita il.e manu'ac-
I f <c'jie of the coun'ry sere m a depressed condi-
; tion, as d pt si time vben pa'notism was alive, and
i \>?s cjii idered necessary, m ihe language of
President Jackson, to piolet the iron inanufactur-
ma; interest—ior our protec'ion in war, as well as
mdependoce 'n lime oí peace—a duty of $30 a
ion wks imposed on ro'le i non Tl e effect ot this
li'fih rate of duty had been t enable 'he State of
Pennsylvanii to produce between twecu-one and
t enty-two millioí s of do'lars of ir«.n manufac-
ture  per annum more, he believed, than the value
of all the cotton irccuc d in an" eiieSt^'e.
