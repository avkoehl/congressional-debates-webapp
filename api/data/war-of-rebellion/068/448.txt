I except the heavy artillery here, which will form a second line, and I have one or two brigades in reserve. If the line is broken in any place, which I don't believe it will be, we will patch it up. I only regret that it will be dark when the assault is made. One of my brigades repulsed Mahone's brigade on the high ground to the front, after which I ordered it to be withdrawn. It was called back in fine order. The attack may not be made to-night.

Division commanders will immediately take measures to have the commands collected, with a line of battle properly secured. The front line of rifle-pits will be examined to see that it is sufficiently manned. Ammunition must be provided for every command. It can be obtained by the ordnance officers. Commanders will at once ascertain the location of their different organizations, and will have them collected together as much as possible.
