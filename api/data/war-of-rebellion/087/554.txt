While leading the troops Lieutenant Otis Fisher, Eighth U. S. Infantry, assistant commissary of musters of the division, fell mortally wounded near the Pegram house. He was ever brave and ready in action, hightoned and chivalrous, and his loss is sincerely mourned. Lieutenant George Goodsell, seventeenth Michigan Volunteers, assistant provost-marshal on my staff, also received a serious wound while zealously and gallantly engaged in carrying orders. My casualties for the day, already sent in, were as follows:

On the morning of October 1 the picket-line left out near the Pegram house was attacked in force, and withdrew to our immediate front, and the day was spent in digging rifle-pits and slashing.

On the morning of the 2nd, under orders from corps headquarters, I moved the division through the woods in line of battle, with the skirmishers, past the Pegram house to the Boisseau house, near which Hartranft's brigade on the right connected with Potter's division. McLaughlen occupied the center and Harriman the left connecting with Mott's division, Second Corps. A forward movement was first ordered from this point, and my skirmishers drove the enemy's pickets some distance. McLaughlen's brigade was advanced about 300 yards up the Boisseau house road, but the movement was countermanded, and the enemy advanced their skirmishers to the foot of the field of the Boisseau house. Their works were in plain sight and they used some artillery. During the demonstration on the enemy's works made by General Mott, a part of Harriman's brigade was moved to the left and occupied the ground vacated by a portion of Mott's troops, but no other assistance was called for. At 6 p. m. the division was withdrawn to a new line running toward the Peebles house, bearing westwardly, the right resting in rear of the Pegram house, and connecting with the Second Division. Here intrenchments were thrown up. Casualties for the day were as follows: Third Brigade, enlisted men, killed, 1; wounded, 8; total 9.

On the morning of October 8, under orders from General Parke, two brigades, Hartranft's and McLaughlen's, moved out on the road from the Clements house toward the Hawks house, and the picket-line, under Colonel Harriman, covering the front between the Pegram house and the Clements house, was at the same time moved out, with supports, toward the enemy. The object was twofold, viz, to make a demonstration upon the enemy's skirmishers, and to reconnoiter toward the Boydton plank road. The head of Hartranft's brigade was at the Clements house at 7 a. m. His brigade was soon deployed on the left of the road, McLaughlen's on the right, connecting with Harriman, who connected with the Second Division. We came upon the enemy's vedettes at an abandoned line of the enemy's works half a mile from
