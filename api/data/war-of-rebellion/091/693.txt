CUMBERLAND, November 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Rosses and McCausland, with two brigades of cavalry, attacked and captured New Creek this a. m. I expect them to attack me here. I have only about 200 men. Send me some force at once if possible.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, November 28, 1864.

Major-General KELLEY:

I have no force that I can use at once. All my command is scattered along railroads. I will try and aid you to-night, but I fear it will be too late.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, November 28, 1864.

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

I send what you require to-night. Any later information?

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., November 28, 1864-6 p. m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Thank you for your promptness. No particulars yet. New Creek, with all forts and property, captured and destroyed. Piedmont is also undoubtedly burnt. If I am attacked it will be at daylight to-morrow morning. I have my little force well in hand, and will fight Rosser if he attack me.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

BALTIMORE, November 28, 1864.

(Received Cumberland 3.50 p. m.)

General B. F. KELLEY:

It is reported that the enemy have attacked New Creek successfully. I trust this is not true. Please advise. You know the great importance of Piedmont and the extensive, costly improvements recently made there. I know I can rely upon your doing all that is possible to preserve that point and the machinery and property there. As the can at once secure prompt and large re-enforcements.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
