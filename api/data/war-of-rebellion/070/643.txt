MARTINSBURG, June 16, 1864.

(Received 6.10 p. m.)

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant- General:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch. My desire to execute General Hunter's instructions with the least delay induced me to make the request to be allowed to communicate with General Halleck in person, which will be done now in writing, as directed. I respectfully request to be informed whether General Halleck received a large requisition for ammunition from General Hunter.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major- General.

MARTINSBURG, W. VA., June 16, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant- General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to forward copies* of letters and order of Major- General Hunter (as I am not aware that the originals have reached General Halleck) relating to the bringing to the army in the field of all the troops that can possibly be spared in the defense of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a reserve force; also to arm all dismounted cavalry with muskets or carbines that they may be made available in the field as a reserve force and as escort to a large ammunition train, for which requisition was forwarded in cipher by General Hunter to Major- General Halleck. I have, therefore, ordered the Tenth West Virginia Infantry, all detachments of regiments with General Crook, and all detachments along the line of the railroad, to be prepared and concentrated at Martinsburg. A number of these detachment are not armed yet, and not having received a report as to the number of these men I cannot state the exact amount of arms required. But I would respectfully request that orders be given to the Ordnance Department to issue on all requisitions made with promptness so that no delay occurs in the march of these troops as ordered by Major- General Hunter.

I shall at the earliest moment possible forward a report of my actions with the number of troops prepared for the field and as escort to the train.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JUL. STAHEL,

Major- General.

MARTINSBURG, June 16, 1864.

Major WILLIAM P. RUCKER, Parkersburg:

It is impracticable for you to reach Staunton at this time. You will proceed to this place with the force under your command with the least practicable delay. All of General Crook's command left behind will concentrate here.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major- General.
