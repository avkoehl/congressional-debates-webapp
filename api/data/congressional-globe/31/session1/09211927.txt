"To enable the Secretary of the Interior to take a per-
petual lease to the United States from thp city of Utica, Mew
York, free of taxes or other charges of any sort, so many
rooms in the City Hall in said city, about to be erected, as
may he necessary tor the propw* accommo iation ot the
United States district and cncuit courts, lioldenin said city,
and their officers, $12,000: Provided, That no part of this
appropriation shall be paid umil it s>half be certified by the
justices of said circuit court that the said rooms are provi-
ded and the said lease made."
Allow me to say to the Senate, that from the
votes taken the other day, we refused to make
appropriations for the erection of court-houses.
This is a very large and important subject, and I
think that when we are upon it, we should em-
brace in our action all the States in this Union.
In my State we furnish court-rooms for the United
States without compensation. It is done elsewhere,
and I think the subject is of such magnitude that
when we act upon it we should apply the same
rule to all the Slates in the Union. I hope, there-
fore, considering the votes that the Senate has
already given, that we will not commence this sys-
tem by piecemeal, by retaining this provision in
the bill; but that we shall strike it out, and let
New York and all the States rest upon the same
basis till we act upon some general system.
Mr. DICKINSON. This clause is as it came
V from the House of Representatives. It was placed,
there upon due consideration, and I hope it will
not be stricken out. I do not desire to ask for
New York the application of a rule different from
that which is applied to other States or places
where the same amount of business is done re-
quiring such accommodations for the courts of the
United States. This is an appropr iation for a per-
manent lease of a court-room. Utica is one of the
most important places in the State of New York.
It is well known that in that great commercial
State, with an extensive frontier and long line of
custom-houses, there is a great deal of business in
the United States courts. This is a very import-
ant point, and as the appropriation has been in-
serted in the bill I hope it will be retained. I do
not wish to ask for New York more than for other
States similarly situated. We are making appro-
priations for custom-houses and court-rooms m
other States, and I see no reason why this should
not be retained in this bill.  
Mr.- EW1NG. It appears that the city of Utica
is about building a City Hall and offers to accom-
modate the United States perpetually on having
this appropriation made. This is the cheapest pos-
sible mode in which the United States can be ac-
commodated with rooms of this kind. They will
have not only court-rooms, but all other necessary
rooms, and they will have fire-proof offices for the
security of the papers, custom-house bonds, and
all other papers necessary to be secured for the
benefit of the United States. An appropriation of
this small amount now will procure better accom-
modations than can be procured for double or per-
haps treble the amount a few years hence.
Mr. BADGER. I feel reluctantly compelled to
vote for this motion of my friend from Kentucky.
I understood the Senate to decide the other day,
upon an application made by the Senator from
Alabama for an appropriation of $lo,000 for.1โข;
erection of a court-house for the use of the United
States in Montgomery, Alabama, that they would
not undertake the building of court-houses for the
accommodation of the United States. Now, it
strikes me that this, arrangement for a perpetual
tease is another, and to my judgment, an objec-
tionable form of making a purchase, i would a
great deal rather, if we do it at all, that the United
States should build the court-houses which these
officers are to use, than to enter into any arrange-
ment by which we are to lease perpetually any
building erected by State authority. And permit
me to say, that I think the fact that Utica is a rich
and flourishing and advancing town in the great-
est and richest State in the Union, an additional
reason why the United States shou.d not be re-
quired to pay for these accommodations, which
are elsewheie furnished without this expense,
see no reason for this discrimination, or why we
should refuse $15,000 to Montgomery and give
&12 000 to Utica to get a perpetual lease.
Mr. DICKINSON. I wish to say that the
clerk's office of the Northern District of New
York is in the city of Utica, and I think the Sen-
ator will hardly find a place where the business
of the court is so large as in that district. All the
papers belonging to that district are kept here per-
manently, and have been ever since my recollec-
tion. The amount of interest will be less than
the annual rent now paid, and I can conceive of
nothing more safe than.a perpetual lease, because
such arrangements are made as to have fire-proof
buildings for all the papers, and they will be safe
from fire and robbery. It is not long since, in the
city of New York, very important papers con-
nected with a criminal prosecution were stolen and
carried away, to the great detriment of the public
interest and publicjustice.
Mr. SEWARD. I wish to say a word with
regard to this amendment, because perhaps I may
be expected to do so. The laws of the United
States require that the office of the clerk for the
northern district of New York shall be kept at
Utica. It is kept in a chamber over a merchant's
store-room, in a block of buildings in the commer-
cial part of the city, where it is much exposed to
danger from fires. It is kept there, because it is
economical to take an upper room, thus situated,
instead of a separate building. And for that ac-
commodation the United States have, ever since
the clerk's office was established, paid rent under
a lease. The simple question in this case is,
whether there is gain in substituting a perpetual
lease, by paying a sum as a principal, the interest
of which would amount to what is now paid, year
by year for rent for the use of buildings less
secure, and ..with less perfect accommodations than
we may obtain by this appropriation. I think
this case justifies the proposed appropriation.
Mr. BRIGHT. The section of the bill pro-
posed to be stricken out, is couched in a little dif-
ferent language from the two amendments which
were offered oil Saturday last, and which were vo-
ted down by a decided majority. The principle,
however, is decidedly the same. This amend-
ment asks for an appropriation of ยง12,000 for the
purchase of a perpetual lease. One amendment
which was offered on Saturday asked for an ap-
propriation of $15,000 to be applied to the build-
ing of a court-house in the city of Montgomery,
Alabama. They are exactly the same in princi-
ple, although somewhat different in their phrase-
ology. Now, I can fully appreciate all the objec-
tions which have been urged against having the
public archives m the possession of private indi-
viduals, and in private houses. I admit that it is
a great inconvenience, and I could wish the evil to
be remedied. But if gentlemen propose to reme-
dy it by the purchase of perpetual leases, and by
incurring the expense of erecting buildings for
court-houses wherever a Federal court is held, I
think they will find that it cannot be done. Gen-
tlemen may rely upon it, however, that whenever
an appropriation is made for the purchase of a
perpetual lease in the State of New Yoik for such
a purpose, a similar claim will come from every
State of the Union, and be pressed here upon this
precedent. And so it ought to be. If the great
and wealthy State of New York is entitled to have
an appropriation of this sort, with how much more j
propriety may the Western States, which are
young, and comparatively poor, ask for similar
appropriations. As I said on Saturday, I am op-
posed to the principle in tolo; but if it is to become !
a precedent in regard to any State of the Union, 1
can present as strong reasons in favor of my State
as can be presented in favor of any other. ^ Gen-
tlemen urge that we are paying rents for buildings
in which to hold our courts, and for offices in
which to lodge the public papers. If the owners
of buildings in New York that are used for these
purposes, are getting rents, they fare infinitely
better than they do in my State. I am opposed
to this amendment, and snail vole against it.
Mr. DOWNS. 1 am glad that this amendment
has been offered, because the objections to it are
precisely m accordance with the opinions I have
i expressed in relation to similar applications in be-
half of the States of Louisiana and Missouri. I
am not going again into the discussion of this
question, but simply wish to make a single remark
m reply to a remark made by the Senator from
New York. This question has been before the
Committee on the Judiciary, and after full exam-
ination has been rejected two or three times oyer,
and reports made to the effect that the United
States were not in the habit of paying rent for
clerks' offices, and that they would not allow such
a charge. A clerk of one of the courts of the Fed-
eral Government made such an application, and
the committee were unanimously of opinion that
such charge ought not to be allowed.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I rise-to state a fact in
reply to^he Senator from New York. The clerk's
office of the Federal court of my State is* kept In a
little building not worth $500. If we are to pro-
vide offices for clerks of the Federal courts in the
State of New York, we must providethem in every
other State. The objection, to this amendment is,
that it would be showing a partiality to the State
of New York, and that it is violative of the vote
which was taken on this subject the other day. It
is also objected, and very properly, that it is a
large subject, and that we ought not to enter upon
it by giving these little appropriations.
Mr. GWIN. I do not know whether the Gov-
ernment has made any appropriations for the build-
ing of court-houses in the State of Mississippi,
either by enabling them to build city halls, or to
lease rooms in buildings, but I have a very strong
impression that appropriations have been made
for that purpose. I think that this is a very proper
amendment.
Mr. FOOTE. I am not perfectly cognizant of
the matter referred to by the Senator from Cali-
fornia, although I have occupied a position which
might have enabled me to know all about this mat-
ter. My opinion is that the people of the city of
Jackson were erecting a City Hall,and that when it
was nearly completed they required a small appro-
priation to enable them to finish it. Some propo-
sition was made to the Government here, in somo
form, for an appropriation, with the understanding
that if this amount should be paid the Govern-
ment should be allowed the use of one of the rooms
in the hall in which to hold its courts. Some ar-
rangement of that sort was made, but I do not
think it was in the nature of a perpetual lease. On
this question, however, I feel bound to say that I
would rather vote to appropriate money for the
erection of suitable buildings in which to hold the
courts of the United States"than to enter into con-
tracts for perpetual leases. On principles of econ-
omy I think the first mentioned policy is decidedly
the most preferable.
The question was then taken on the motion to
strike out the clause, aHd a division being called
for, there were ayes 25, noes 14.
So the motion to strike out was adopted.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I wish to amend the
item " For supplies of deficiencies in the fund for
the relief of sick seamen, including the furnishing
of five new marine hospitals now building, viz:
Paducah, Kentucky; Chicago, Illinois; Natchez,
Mississippi; Napoleon, Arkansas; St. Louis, Mis-
souri, $2u0,000;" by adding, " For the relief and
protection of mariners and boatmen on the West-
ern waters, to be disbursed under the direction of
the Secretary of the Treasury, ยง10,000."
I wish to state to the Senate some facts in re-
gard to this subject. 1 have read the clause which
shows that the deficiencies are considerable, and ,
they are here blended in an appropriation of
$200,000, to supply these marine hospitals. I
went the other day to the Treasury Department to
ootain this information. I find that the receipts
for the hospical at New Orleans amount to
$7,045 20, and the expenditures to $22,295 87.
The amount of receipts at Vicksburg, Nashville,
St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, Pittsburg, and
Wheeling, are ยง7,337 50, and the expenditures at
these ports are the same in each as the receipts,
while at New Orleans the excess of expenditures
over the receipts is $19,250 67. These places, ex-
clusive of New Orleans, are all ports of delivery
along the river. In reference to these ports, the
authorities here have limited the expenditures pre-
cisely to the amount of the leceipts. Now, sir,
my information, which will be sustained by every
Western man who has paid any attention to the
subject, is, that this limitation of these appropri-
ations to the mere receipts does not make any-
thing like an adequate provision for the sick and
disabled seamen upon our Western boats. My
obiect is to appropriate ten thousand dollars in
aid of this fund of $200,000 to provide for that
suffering class of our fellow-citizens who are en-
gaged in commercial pursuits on our Western
waters, in steamboats, and registered or licensed
Mr. GWIN. I hope the Senator from Ken-
tucky will accept of an amendmenx which I pro-
pose to offer to his amendment. It is to add after
the "Western waters" the words ' Pacific
coast," and to increase the sum from "ten to
" fifty" thousand dollars. If he will do so I will
