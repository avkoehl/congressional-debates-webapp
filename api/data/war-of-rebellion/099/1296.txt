Raleigh, N. C.:

MY DEAR SIR: General Lee has written to me in regard to desertions from the army, and states that, while they occur among the troops from every State, they are most numerous just at present from those of North Carolina.

I will be happy to hear from you at any time, and am, yours, very truly,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.
