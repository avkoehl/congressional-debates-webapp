Bough's Factory, via Pulaski, Lexington:

General Croxton, from Four-Mile Creek, reports that the enemy attacked him at Shoal Creek, compelling him to fall back to his present position. I wish you to get into position and co-operate with General Croxton as soon as possible, and do all you can to drive the enemy back or resist his farther progress. General Croxton will report to you and give you all the information he has.

Major-General THOMAS:

The force which made the demonstration last night has disappeared and Colonel Gallup has sent scouts to get information. Three hundred mounted men of Second Tennessee have arrived at Johnsonville. I will wait here until some of my troops get up, and then be guided by the information I shall obtain. Please have the operator sent to Waverly.
