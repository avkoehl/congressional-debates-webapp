Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. That is the
twenty per cent, over again. The other was
the test question. It is the same amendment
for the House that was agreed to for the Senate.
Mr. LAWRENCE, ot Ohio. I demand the
yeas and nays.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. We will
gain nothing by that. We have already had
the yeas and nays. I hope the gentleman will
withdraw his demand.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I want them
once more.
The }7eas and nays were not ordered.

For folding documents, including materials, $42,000.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I hope
that will not be agreed to. I have made some
inquiries and find it will take $50,000 for the
purpose designated. Every dollar of it will be
required.
The amendment was non-concurred in.
Ninth amendment:
Amend lines one hundred and sixty-six and one
hundred and sixty-seven so as to read:

Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. That is
wrong j the salary ought not to be $1,000. The
twenty per cant, only carries it up to $1,000.
Mr. WOODBRIDGE. The amendment pro-
vides for precisely what these librarians now
have by law. It is only in accordance with
the principle we adopted in voting compensa-
tion to the employes of the House and Senate.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I ask the
gentleman what the law is?
Mr. WOODBRIDGE. I have not the law
with me; but it is in accordance with the
amendments just read by the Clerk.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. This twenty
per cent, was allowed on all sums under and
up to $10,000. If this amendment is carried
it. gives this particular assistant librarian an
advantage over others.
Mr. WOODBRIDGE. Not at all. It does
not give him any advantage whatever; it is
precisely what the law provides he may have.
The amendments were agreed to.

Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. These are
the amendments offered by the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr, Butler] in regard to the
compensation of the Private Secretary and other
persons connected with the presidential estab-
lishment. -1 voted for the amendments in Com-
mittee of the Whole, but I believe the gentle-
man from Massachusetts has been satisfied that
the force there is not more than is necessary
and is not disposed to press the amendments
in the House. I hope, therefore, the amend-
ments will be disagreed to, leaving the matter
in accordance with existing law.
The amendments were severally disagreed to.

proviso:
Provided, That, no officer of the Army or Navy shall
be detailed or assigned to duty as a private secretary
