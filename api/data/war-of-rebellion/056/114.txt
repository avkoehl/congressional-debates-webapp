HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Vicksburg, Miss., November 10, 1863.

Maj. H. E. EASTMAN,Commanding Red Bone Church:

MAJOR: General Leggett, commanding at Big Black bridge, reports nearly the whole force of rebel cavalry moving via Clinton and Raymond in a southerly direction. Keep a strict watch on the fords and ferries across the Big Black River in your front, and if possible ascertain whether the enemy is still continuing his course south of Raymond or turning in toward the Big Black and Grand Gulf.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Vicksburg, Miss., November 10, 1863.

Captain OWEN, U. S. NAVY,Commanding Gun-boat Fleet:

GENERAL: Brig. General J. P. Hawkins, at Goodrich's Landing, reports a force of the enemy 2,000 strong, with eight new pieces of artillery, at Floyd or Bayou Macon. If the enemy are there in such force, their object doubtless is to make a raid on the plantations on the west side of the river, and perhaps attack the force at Goodrich's Landing or Milliken's Bend. I have to request that you will send one or two of your gun-boats to Goodrich's Landing to assist General Hawkins if necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, November 11, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General GRANT,

Chattanooga, Tennessee:

Dispatches just received from Schofield state that General Steele has advanced to Arkadelphia, and that it was doubtful if he could re-enforce Hurlbut, who seems to be pretty hard pressed. He must, therefore, retain all he can from Sherman's command till others arrive. Do you hear anything of Burnside?

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 11, 1863-7 p.m.

(Received 6.55 a.m., 12th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Hurlbut was instructed several days ago to retain Tuttle's division from Vicksburg for the present. Line down between Louisville and Knoxville for two days. Sherman will be at Stevenson on Friday.

Major-General Commanding.
