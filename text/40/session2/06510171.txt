40tii Cong....2d Sess.
National Expenditures, &c.—Mr. Lawrence.
Ho. of Reps.
tee of Appropriations, will work a great reduc-
tion on this estimate.
They are as follows:
To civil service, including legislative, executive,
judicial government of territories, foreign inter-
course and miscellaneous  §36,430,912 32
Pensions  30,330,000 00
Indians  3,000,000 00
"War Department  33,082,093 00
Navy  18,096,015 00
West Point Military Academy  303,000 00
Intereston publicdebt  130,000,000 00
Bounties to soldiers  25,000,000 00
Total 5270,212,050 32
This is a reduction on the basis of the last
year of Democratic rule of $25,240,981 84.
The civil and miscellaneous service in the last
year of Democratic rule was $27,969,870 48
in gold, equal now in paper to §39,157,818 07,
•while the proposed appropriations are only
$86,430,912 32, being a reduction of $2,720,-
906 35. The estimate of Mr. Wells, Special
Commissioner of the Revenue, is that the ex-
penditures for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1809, would be:
Civil service $40,000,000
Pensions and Indians  26,000,000
Afar Department  53,000,000
Navy  21,000,000
Interest on the public debt  130,000,000
Total 8270,000,000
(House Ex. Doc. No. 81, 40th Cong., 2 Sess., Jan-
uary, 1868.)
General Grant asks for the War Depart-
ment §33,000,000. (Blaine's speech, Feb-
ruary 0, 1808.) If Congress shall indorse the
appropriations asked by a Republican Commit-
tee of Appropriations the public burdens will
be greatly reduced, but I demand a still greater
reduction, so that we may deserve to have it
said, "We knew our duty and did it fully."
The Secretary of the Treasury tells us—
" That the contracting of large public debts is un-
avoidably attended with imprudent, it not reckless,
expenditures, and that when those intrusted with or
possessing governing power have once enjoyed the
luxury of using or expending freely the moneys un-
der their control, (and this is always the case during
the progress of expensive wars,) proper economy is
afterward exceedingly difficult to be enforced."—

democratic extravagance.
And now, sir, I charge upon the adminis-
tration of Andrew Johnson, supported as it is
by every rebel South and every Democrat of
the North, a deliberate purpose to oppress the
people by extravagant and profligate public
expenditures.
The Secretary of the Treasury asks for appro-
priations for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1809, as follows:
For the civil scvvicc $51,000,000
For pensions and Indians  35,000,000
For the War Department, including
$25,500,000 lor bounties  120.000,000
For the Navy Department  36,000,000
For the interest on the public debt  130,000,000
Total $372,000,000
(House Ex. Doc. No. 2, 40th Cong. 2d Sess.; An.
Rep. Sec. Treasury.)
The pending appropriation bills propose
$270,242,050 32, being a reduction of $95,757,-
950 68 on the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury.
The Secretary of the Navy asked for appro-
priations for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1809, to carry on ship-building, for the repair
of navy-yards, and for expenses, amounting to
$47,317,183 95, (Rep. See. Navy, Dec. 2,1867.)
But Congress having revolted at such a de-
mand, he sent in revised estimates, in which he
says:
"In the revision the contemplated reduction of the
naval and marine forces, in accordance with bills
no1,v beforo Congress, and the expression of the House
of Representatives that ' it is unnecessary to pro-
ceed further atpresent inbuildiug or equipping ships
of war,'has been considered.'' * ^ ':-
"Tho estimates submitted last year for the navy-
yards, and which have this year been repeated—Con-
gress declining at its hist session to muke the appro-
priations asked—indicate, in part, what is required
to place the navy-yards in an efficient condition, and
at no distant day the improvementscalled for should
be made." i- * * * ***&
" In view of the obvious disposition to curtail ex-
penditures and to postpone to a future day the im-
provement of our navy-yards, as well as to reduce
the number of men in the Navy and Marine corps, I
have thought proper to revise the bureau estimates,
and to indicato the appropriations considered essen-
tial, and without which the service may be seriously
crippled.
"The estimates submitted with my annual report
amount to $47,317,183 95; the revised estimates, here-
with transmitted, to $24,924,478 03; a reduction of
£22,392,70j 92."—IZoxtse Ex. l)oc. Ill, 40 th Cong. 2 Sess.,

Mr. Speaker, I have said I am in favor of a
reduclion in the proposed appropriations.
do justice to soldiers, their widows, and or-
phans.
The people ask no reduction of bounties to
soldiers nor of pensions to them, their widows,
or orphans. For one I am in favor of extend-
ing and increasing some of them until justice
is done to every living soldier and to the fam-
ily of every one who is dead. I have voted
and will again vote to do justice to the needy
soldiers of the war of 1812.
now to reduce expenses.
And I would economize and provide the
means of doing this by a general reduction in
the number of officers and in the amounts of
some of the salaries and expenditures in nearly
every department of the Government.
In many branches of the public service there
are thousands of officers whom J would not
underrate, but whose duties do not require the
talent, learning, or skill of those who print the
books and papers that educate the young and
the old, or of the mechanic whose genius and
intellect, aided by strong arms, create the
houses we live in, the steam-engines, ships,
and railroads cars that facilitate and carry on
commerce and travel, or the implements of
husbandry and art which develop the wealth
and ornament the land. Many of the offices
do not require the talent or skill necessary to
till the earth successfully and produce the
bread upon which we live. Yet in a large
majority of the districts represented on this
floor these officers, for the performance of
duties less onerous than the labor 1 have de-
scribed, are receiving a compensation largely
in excess of the rewards of skilled industry.
The rewards of labor, I know, should be in-
creased. But I know of no rule of justice
which will not compensate the various forms
of labor equally with official duties requiring
no greater learning and skill, and official sal-
aries should be conformed to that standard.
But what is the proper mode of retrenching?
where to begin' retrenchment.
Mr. Speaker, I would begin here in this Cap-
itol. I would cut down the salaries of mem-
bers of Congress.
In a speech which it was my privilege to
make in this House December 20, 1860, in
favor of a bill I introduced for that purpose, I
gave my views fully, and I need not repeat
them now. That bill did not receive a favor-
able consideration.
On the 25th of March, 1867, I introduced
another bill, now pending in the Committee of
the Whole, to restore the salary of members of
Congress to what it was prior to the increase,
but to cut down mileage one half. The gen-
tleman from West Virginia [Mr. Hubbard]
lias introduced a joint resolution, now before
the Committee on Appropriations, proposing
a reduction in the annual salary and mileage.
On two other occasions I have urged a reduc-
tion of mileage—on the 26th of March, 1SG7,
and February 7,1808.
The argument used against this is that the
pay now allowed in currency is no greater than
the former pay in gold; that the order of talent
employed here in many cases could earn more
in other pursuits; that the law which increased
the pay cut down mileage one half, and so
equalized the compensation of members with-
out materially increasing the aggregate ex-
penses ; and finally, if the suggestion be enti-
tled to respectful notice, we are told that mem-
bers in favor of a reduction may decline to
receive the increased salary. My views are
already known; and I will only now repeat
that if it bo a sacrifice on our part to reduce
the compensation it is one we ought to make
in view of onerous taxation, and to put us in
a position consistently to reduce salaries gen-
erally. Every effort at reduction is met with
the objection that our own pay should be re-
duced ; and the evil is not remedied if one or
a dozen members should decline to accept the
compensation fixed by law. If a single mem-
ber should do so only one dollar in every two
hundred and forty-two would be saved to his
constituents. They would still be taxed to
pay all others the full salary, while they would
receive none of the benefits accruing there-
from.
tiie nextstep in retrenchment.
The next step in retrenchment, in my judg-
ment, should be more sweeping in its character.
There is one fact well known here not so
generally understood by the people.
Each standing committee in Congress rep-
resents and has charge of some one branch of
the public service, which is also represented
itselt by a department of the Government.
Thus the Judiciary Committee, of which I have
the honor to be a member, is charged with the
duty, among others, of supervising bills affect-
ing the courts and law officers of the Govern-
ment. The Committee of Ways and Means
has charge of the internal revenue laws, and in
part passes on matters affecting the Treasury,
and especially that branch of it known as the in-
ternal revenue department. So various other
committees have charge of military and naval
affairs, public lands, commerce, pensions, &c.
The duties of the Committee of Ways and
Means and the Departments of the Govern-
ment it represents involve more labor and ex-
pense and require greater responsibilities than
the whole government of several of the States.
No one member of Congress ever did or ever
will understand all the details of bills reported
by all the committees, much less of the De-
partments of Government they represent. This
Government is a vast and complicated ma-
chinery.
We are compelled to rely on the reports of
committees in very many matters to govern our
votes.
Now, sir, as no one member can learn all
the details of needed retrenchments, we should
require each Cabinet officer to report what
reductions of expenses can be made in his
Department, and instruct each standing com-
mittee of the House to leport snch bills affect-
ing the public service as will reduce expenses
to the lowest point compatible with justice and
the national interests. This mode, I believe,
will be effectual; any other, 1 fear, will be a
failure.
how some expenses increase.
I will present a few examples of the mode in
which ail increase has been made in some De-
partments, and that will serve to illustrate how
they and others may he remedied.
