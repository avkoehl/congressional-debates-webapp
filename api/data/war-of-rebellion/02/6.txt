office, I have the honor to report that the U. S. Armory at Harper's Ferry was established in the year 1796.

The amount expended on the same is --

For land purchased at different times ................. $45,477

For improvements thereon for water-power, canals,

embankments, walls, and water privileges, and for hydraulic

machinery and buildings of all kinds ................... 1,787,430

_____________

Total, exclusive of the amount expended in the

manufacture and repair of arms ......................... 1,832,907

The latest annual inventory of the property belonging to the United States at that armory is dated June 30, 1860, in which the value of all the property on hand that date is appraised as follows, viz:

1,669 1/2 acres of land ................................. $37,457

Mill-dams, callas, water-powers, and hydraulic machinery. 233.279

Forges, rolling-mills, machine-shops, storehouses,

dwellings, and other buildings .......................... 341,221

____________ Amount of real estate ................................... 611,957

Machines used in workshops ...................$270,235

Tools used in service ........................ 109,560

________ 379,795

Unwrought materials on hand .................. 100,043

Parts used in service ........................ 93,573

________ 193,616

20,507 arms of different models in store ................ 285,145

__________

Total appraised value June 30, 1860 ..................... 1,470,513

By the latest returns received at this office from the armory, it appears that the number of arms ins tore when the armory was destroyed in April, 1861, was reduced to 4,287, the value of which was about $64,000.

We may assume that the quantity and value of all other property than the arms in store remained without material change from June, 1860, to April, 1861. The diminished number of arms in store at the latter date reduces that item in the inventory form $285,145 to $164,300, and the total appraised value of all the property from $1,470,513 to $1,207,668.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. MAYNADIER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Ordnance.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.

U. S. CAPITOL, November 14, 1861.
