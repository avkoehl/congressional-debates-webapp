retreat. I am this morning sending out a reconnaissance in force. I learn that the forces which attacked me consisted of the entire available forces of the enemy in Arkansas.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

B. M. PRENTISS,

Major-General.

Numbers 2. Reports of Major General Benjamin M. Prentiss, U. S. Army, commanding District of Eastern Arkansas.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, July 4, 1863-10.30 a. m.

GENERAL: We have been hard pressed since daylight by the combined forces of Price, Holmes, Marmaduke, Parsons, Carter, Dobbin, and company. Thus far we have held out own, and have captured several hundred prisoners, whom I send to you by Major [Edward] Wright, of the Twenty-fourth Iowa, and board the steamer Tycoon. The enemy are now evidently preparing for a renewed attack in force. I wish you, by all means, to send me re-enforcements. The enemy is in superior force, but I shall do my best to hold them in check till re-enforcement arrive. Send also another gunboat, if possible. The Tyler has done good service to-day, but I need more. I trust I may have help from you at once, so that we may punish the rebel forces in Arkansas in Earnest.

In great haste, your obedient servant,

B. M. PRENTISS,

Major-General.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.

P. S.-Please send also ordnance stores as per inclosed memorandum, or as much of them as possible. Send the shell in particular.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, July 4, 1863-3 p.m.

GENERAL: We have repulsed the enemy at every point, and our soldiers are now collecting their wounded. We have taken in all 1,200 prisoners, and their loss in killed and wounded will reach 500 or 600. But, although the rebels are badly whipped, there is no doubt whatever that they will renew the attack at an early moment, and that they are now massing their troops for that purpose. My force is inferior to the rebels, and is much weakened by the action. I trust, therefore, that the re-enforcements I wrote you for this morning may be promptly forwarded, and that the ammunition also may reach me in due season. With the aid I expect from you and the gunboats, the rebel army may be severely beaten. The Tyler has been to-day a valuable auxiliary, and I depend much on the assistance of another gunboat.

I remain, general, your obedient servant,

B. M. PRENTISS,

Major-General.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.
