Lieutenant M. J. RUSSELL,

A. A. A. G., Second Div., Dept. of West Virginia:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report the following statement of David Bowman, a conscript and deserter from the rebel army. He arrived here this morning from Dayton, 4 miles west of Harrisonburg, Va., which place he left on last Sunday, 21st instant. He reports General Early, with a force of about 3,000 or 4,000 infantry, at Taylor's Springs, 5 miles east of Harrisonburg. He states that he (Bowman) was informed my one of General Rosser's command that there were between 200 and 300 desertions from the rebel army during General Early's late raid in this part of the country. He also states that General Rosser with a battalion of cavalry is now near Augusta, Va., encamped at Mount Meridian; he reports Imboden at or near Lexington, Va. with a force of about 800, composed of cavalry, mounted infantry, infantry, and six pieces artillery.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN WALLACE

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,Cumberland:

Deserter from Lomax's brigade, this side Staunton, came in during the night. Says Rosser's command most all on furlough. Imboden was in Rockbridge. Horses of all commands scanty and in poor condition. Gilmor is out on scout. Small dismounted parties foraging through the country. Heard of no movement in any direction. I reckon that the force at Franklin is a strong picket posted in apprehension of an advance of us.
