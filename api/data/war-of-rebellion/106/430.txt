HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., May 11, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit herewith a communication addressed to my headquarters by Brigadier General P. Edward Connor, commanding the District of Utah, dated on the 28th ultimo. * I am doing all that is my power to re-enforce General Connor. The battalion of the Third Infantry will march from Sacramento in a few days, and I am advised by the acting Governor of Nevada Territory that he is using the most strenous exertions to comply with my requisition on him for two companies of cavalry and two of infantry. I think that with prudence and good management we need apprehend on immediate disturbance in Utah, but we should have there a military force strong enough to look down all opposition and maintain the supremacy of our laws and institutions. I telegrahed you to-day recommending, if it were possible, that re-enforcements for Connor be sent at once from the adjoining department east of him. Under no circumstances could I for a moment entertain the idea of recommending the withdrawal of our troops from Utah. At whatever cost, the great highway connecting the Eastern States with the Pacific must be kept open and under the control of the United States.

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., May 11, 1863.

His Excellency S. S. HARDING,

Governor of Utah Territory, Great Salt Lake City, Utah Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's communication of the 27th ultimo, for which I have to thank you. The condition of affairs in Utah has for a long tiem past received my most serious consideration. I have been kept fully informed on all the topies embraced in Your Excellency's letter by Brigadier-General Connor, and I am now straining every nerve to throw forward re-enforcements. A battalion of the Third Infantry, now at Sacramento, will march in a few days, taking with it two 6-pounder brass guns, one 12-pounder field howitzer, and one 12-pounder mountain howitzer, with an ample supply of ammunition. The company of Second Cavalry, which was at Fort Churchill is temporarily engaged int he Owen's Valley district. It willb e thrown forward toward Utah at an early day. The acting Governor of Nevada Territory is making strenuous exertions to comply with my requisition for two companies of cavalry and two of infantry, with a fair prospect of success. When raised it is designed to move them promptly to Salt Lake. I have telegraphed to the Adjutant-General of the Army requesting, if it is possible to do so, that re-enforcements for General Connor be promptly advanced from the military department east of you. I can assure you, Governor, that I am fully sensible to the importance of maintaining the supremacy of our laws and institutions in the Territory of Utah, and can only regret that the force at my disposal is no inadequate to meet the emergency.

With great respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
