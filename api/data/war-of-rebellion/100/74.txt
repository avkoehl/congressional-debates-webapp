NEW YORK CITY, April 1, 1865. (Received 2 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have just seen General Anderson. He feels as I do about putting on other steamers and letting gentlemen and their families go to Charleston next week. It is an event which happens but once in an age. Of course they go at their own expense, either in Government vessels or chartered steamers. The collector of New York could give permits, or the steamers could report to General Gillmore and not land passengers without his orders. I shall go, with wife and son.

H. W. BEECHER.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, April 1, 1865-3. 30 p. m.

Rev. H. W. BEECHER, Brooklyn:

I have authorized Collector Draper to clear vessels for Hilton Head with passengers for Charleston and Sumter cremonies.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
