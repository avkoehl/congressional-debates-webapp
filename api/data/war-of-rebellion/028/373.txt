NEW CREEK, VA., September 28, 1862.

Colonel McREYNOLDS,

First New York Cavalry, Commanding Expedition:

COLONEL: I have just received information that a large cavalry and artillery force left Martinsburg yesterday at 2 p.m., on the road to Romney and Moorefield. I regret exceedingly you did not go forward last night, as I now fear your expedition will be an utter failure. If this reaches you before you leave the junction, you will fall back to this place at once; if not, as soon as you have accomplished the object of your expedition, you will move at once from Moorefield across to Williamsport, and thence into the New Creek Valley and down it, to this place. Captain Firey can pilot you. I will send forage and rations to meet you at Greenland.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
