Report of Colonel Isaac C. B. Suman, Ninth Indiana Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH INDIANA VOLUNTEER INFANTRY,In Camp at Chattanooga, Tenn., September 29, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of the marches made and the part taken in the late action by the Ninth Indiana Volunteer Infantry since leaving camp at Poe's Tavern, Tenn., September 9, 1863.:

In compliance with orders, the regiment marched for Friar's Island, on the Tennessee River, at 8 p.m., and arrived at the landing a distance of 12 miles, at 2 a.m. Shortly after daylight on the morning of the 10th, the regiment forded the river (the water being waist deep and very swift), and, after a short rest, the regiment pushed forward, through a deep dust, with the brigade a distance of 11 miles, and went into camp at a large spring, the water of which was cold and clear.

Friday, September 11.- Weather clear and very hot; marched at daylight; crossed the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at 9 a.m. at Graysville Station; from thence marched with the division to Ringgold, Ga., where the regiment camped for the night, having marched during the day 11 miles.

September 12.-Marched shortly after daylight in a westward direction. Shortly after starting, the Ninth, with the Forty-first Ohio Volunteers, threw forward two companies as skirmishers, who soon succeeded in driving the rebel cavalry that had threatened to retard our advance. At 3 p.m. arrived at Lee and Gordon's Mills, where General Wood's division was encamped. At 5 p.m. the regiment with the brigade made a reconnaissance to the front. After driving the rebels about 2 miles, night coming on, the regiment with the brigade fell back and encamped near Lee and Gordon' Mills.

September 13.-Remained encamped during the entire day.
