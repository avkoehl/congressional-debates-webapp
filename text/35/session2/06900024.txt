APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 4,
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
individual and national usefulness ought not to be
diminished by any; misapprehension of its true
character and functions. Applying these general
remarks to the precise question of the present rate
of postage, I feel bound to say that the last re-
duction bolow five cents and the discounts allowed
on the already great!y reduced rates on printed
matter, have greatly curtailed the usefulness of
the Department in extending our mail service with
that celerity, frequency, and uniformity to all
parts of our country which the spirit of improve-
ment in every department of business and of so-
cial life so earnestly demands. There are many
portions of the United States which have not yet
received satisfactory mail facilities, and are not
likely soon to do so with the present inadequate
means of the Department.
In a compact and dense population the present
rate might bear some reasonable proportion to
j.v the actual cost of transportation; but in a widely
extended country, like the United States, now
reaching from one ocean to the other, and in many
portions of it thinly populated, three cents would
seem to be altogether insufficient to meet the ac-
tual expense incurred by the Governmentin send-
ing forward the letters. Heretofore our entire
California correspondence has been conducted at
ton cents, it being over three thousand miles by
the Panama route. Since the establishment of our
various overland routes, however, all our great
cities of the valley of the Mississippi are brought
within the three thousand miles,anil therefore will
pay the inadequate postage of only three cents. It
is not likely that the people of the AtlanticStatcs,
and especially of their large citics, will be willing
to pay ten cents on their extensive correspond-
ence to California, Washington, and Oregon,
whilst those m the Mississippi valley will have
to pay only three cents. To avoid this source of
dissatisfaction and the practical inconvcnicncc of
having different rates, regulated by distances, it is
respectfully submitted to the superior wisdom of
Congress whether one uniform rate of five cents
for all distances would not enlarge the usefulness
of the Department, diminish, if it did not entirely
prevent, such heavy drafts on the Treasury, and
best promote the interest and convenience of the
people.
In relation to the franking privilege, it is im-
possible to tell to what extent it is abused—not
often, it is to be hoped, by those to whom it is
allowed by law, but by others, who take the lib-
erty to sign their names under somo pretended
authority to do so, or under no authority at all.
It is impossible for the 28,000 postmasters of the
United States to judge of the genuineness of the
signatures, and therefore they can do nothing to
prevent abuses. In times of national as well as
State elections, the Post Office conveyances are
literally loaded down with partisan documents,
for which it is evident somebody should pay, if
it. is expected that the Department should even
approximate its own support. Now, if it be de-
sired by Congress that all these documents be
transmitted at public expense, let the stamps be
furnished and charged to members who frank
them, so that Congress may keep watch over the
privileges granted to their own members and pre-
vent abuses which this Department has no power
to detect,

If there be added to the above $91 90 lost by
bad debts, and the sum of §925 35 gained on the
suspense account he subtracted, then the net
amount of expenditures will be $12,721,636 56,
as adjusted in the Auditor's office.
The gross revenue for the year 1858, including
receipts from letter-carriers and from foreign post-
ages, amounted to $7,486,792 86, as stated below:

ment by the acts of Marcfr 3, 1847, and March
3,1851, for the transportation and delivery of free
mail matter for Congress and the Executive De-
partments, thus making the whole revenue of the
year amount to $8,186,792 86, which falls short
of the expenditures, as adjusted on the Auditor's
books, $4,534,843 70.

highly satisfactory report of the Auditor, hereto
