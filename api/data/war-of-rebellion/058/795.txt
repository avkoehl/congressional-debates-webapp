Brigadier-General RUGGLES:

Forrest at last accounts was within 3 miles of Okolona in pursuit of the enemy, who was still retreating. I think they are bound for Memphis. On evening of 20th two brigades of infantry were 10 miles east of Decatur, moving westward. Their army is evidently returning to Vicksburg.

Colonel RICHARD HARRISON:

If General Ruggles is at Columbus you will assume command of all the mounted force of General Ruggles and move up to Cotton Gin Port. The enemy is at Okolona and may attempt to cross at that point or above. Should they do so you will harass and prevent them from doing so. Should they cross you will check them all you can. Keep in their front, burn all bridges behind you, and keep me advised of all their movements. Send a copy of this to General Ruggles.
