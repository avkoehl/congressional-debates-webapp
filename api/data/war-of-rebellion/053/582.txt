GENERAL: The receipt of your communication of the 26th ultimo, asking instructions on several points, is hereby acknowledged.

First. In reply I respectfully state that by the abolishment of districts and the appointment of Major-General Lee by the President to the command of all the cavalry in Mississippi all control of the cavalry referred to has been withdrawn from you, except such as may be assigned to your command on detached duty.

Second. The condition of the Second Regiment Alabama Cavalry, and Boyles' battalion is the same as the other cavalry formerly under your command.

Third. You will apply to Major-General Lee for such details as you may require for couriers, scouting, and picket service.

Fourth. The abolishment of districts obviates any necessity for an answer to your fourth inquiry.
