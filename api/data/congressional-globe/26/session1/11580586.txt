Independent Treasury—Mr. Davis.
H. of Eeps.
besi aojuaimed wi.h the •• virus, withes, feelings,
and it rests. In exam i  e «his bill, the sentle-
mán s* ■' thit the amou . . money appiopu^'ed
in it was $21,000. This. appeaieJ on the lace of
i ; bat there wa* something;, he said, that wa.
eo-ered up in it which wa.  hid irom public vie*,
bat which would be perfectly apparent when
be mentioned it. The S-cretary of the
Treasury, and the friends of the bill, he
said, had admitted that it would require
fi?e Billions of dollars to be all the time in
Treasury. Here, said Mr. D. [ think the gentle-
man has misunderstood the Secretary. He said
that there would not be likely to be more than that
amount in the Treasury at any one time, and not that
that amount would be all the time iu the Treasury.
The interest on that sum, said the gentleman, at
7 par cent, will be three hundred and fifty thousand
dollar , to «hich add the twenty-one ihou>and dol-
lars, makes three hundred and seventy-one thou-
sand dollars; bat you may double this sum, said he,
for it will take ten mdlieasof dollars íustead of
five, and that will be seven hundred and forty-two
thou and dollars per annum, drawn fiom the tax
payers unnecessarily by this bill. Thi-, then, said
Mr. D. may be said to be the reason given by the
bank interest lor thcr opposition to it.
I have taken seme trouble to look into this inte-
rest account, by examining the monthly returns of
the Bank of the United States for the sixteen years
that she was tbe fiscal agent of the Government;
and then takirg the annual returns of the depo-ite
Banks from the removal of the deposites to the sus-
pension in 1837, and tbe following has been the re-
sult of that examination:
Amount of deposites in the United Slates Bank
according to the monthly returns:
1818   #7,609,501 90    1826 #6,993,350 45
1819    2.960,718 08    1827  7,623.228 18
1820    2,965,018 58 1828 8 032.255 80
1831   2,337,071 46    1829  8,168,025 59
1823    3,485,118 30    1830  7,899,904 29
1833        6,874,418 31            1831      8,186 241 21
1824        8,081,076 98            1832 11,337,722 21
1S25       6,393,366 74           1833     8,529,040 61
The average annual amount in the Treasury dur-
ing tbe above period was $6,717,191 17. Upon
this I had calculated an interest of 6 per cent, but
as the gentleman, who understands interest better
than I do, has charged 7 per ient. he will not com-
plain, I trust, ifl should adopt the same rule for his
friends, which will make $7,523,254 11 whole
amount of interest received on the deposites. But this
is not all. I am informed that the rule of banking is to
issue two dollars in paper for every dollar of de-
positee, and loan that out also. If this is the /act,
then the interest account of tbe United States Bank
alone is #22,569,662 33.
In the deposite banks, I have taken the amount
reported to be on hand at tbe end cf each year. I
now show the balance in the Treasury, as pre-
sented to Congress by the Secretary of tbe Trea-
sury.
1834        #11,702,905 31   Interest      $702,774 31
1835            8,892 858 42         "            533 571 50
18J6 26,749,803 96 " 1,604,988 23
1837         45,968,523 86         "        2,758,111 43
#5,599,445 47
If this amount was all the time in tbe banks, the
interest accruing on it at 6  per cent, would be
#5,599,445 47; but at 7 per cent, it will be #6,524,-
986 40.    Apply the same rale to this that we did
to the other, viz: that they   issue  two dollars in
notes for each dollar of deposite, and loan that
oat also, and you have il.e sum of #19,574,858 21.
Add this to tbe profits of the United States Bank,
and you have the round sum of #41,144,420 44
realized by less tbau one hundred banks, by their
having the custody and u-e of the pable money.
This explains the reason, to a great extent, of ihe
opposition to the bill   now under  consideration.
Those gentlemen who live by their wit.-, and not
by their labor, understand all these things.
Here it will be proper to remark that a portion
of the money in tbe United States Bank belonged to
tbe sinking fund, under tbe act of March 5, 1817,
setting apart ten millions of do.lars to pay tbe in-
terest and also to reduce tbe principal of tbe debt
of the R. vlut'on and lat- v.r On t e 12h t>f
rebru.i •., 1816, t*1 >   lolt debt ai... nn'f.' !o
5.123,63k 92 95. On Hie 30th Septemret o !ow-
,na; it w.i> reduced to $108,745,818. The who'e
average annual amount m the bank for Mj'een
>ears was #6,717,191 17. Of this sum 1 think it
is fiir to charge $2,000,000 to the sinking fut.1,
leaving #4,717,191 17 as the amount applicable to
ordinary expenses all the time in the Treasury for
sixt en years. From this it would appear that the
sum ot $5 000,000, as estimated by the Stcietary
of the Treisury, is not much out of the way, and
not #10,000 000, as the gentlemau from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Sergeant] supposed.
Tbe worst times said the gentleman, that the
country ha* ever seen, has been under the Sub-
Treasury system. Now I am certain, said Mr. D.
that my honorable colleague does not intend to
mislead the committee or the public in this matter,
but he has surely forgotten the distress in th  coun-
try about twenty yeats ago. I will here relate my
own personal experience at that period; and expe-
rience, we all know, is the best of teachers. It is
not necessary, therefore, for me to go to the statis-
tics of the country, when my own experience is a
component part of them.
In 1816, wheat brought, in the Philadelphia
market, where the gentleman resides #3 per bushel;
corn from $1 75 to $2; oats 75 to 80 cents.
In 1821. prices sunk down .-o low that wheat
brought only 62a cents, corn 31 cents, and oats
only 181 cents per bushel. I ploughed the ground,
and sowed the seed, cut it, threshed it, and hauled
it to market, at both those period . The land on
which this grain grew cost, in 1815, #125 per acre,
and at that time it would not bring more than #50.
Mechanics, who had received $1 25 cent  per day,
and were found, were reduced down to 621 cents,
and many were out of employment altogether, and
other laboring men received wases in the same
proportion. Land fell from $125 per acre to $50,
and in some cases lower. Hundreds and thou-
sands of honest farmers wjio had passed the meri-
dian of life, and, by a long course of industry, had
accumulated a little property to make them com-
fortable in old sge, if they were one fourth in deb
for their land, and were pushed for it, the
whole was swept from tbem. Or if a
man bad one farm clear, and a second one
for which he owed one-half the purchase money, it
took them both to pay the debt. As gentlemen of
the bar generally fatten on the miseries of the peo-
ple, 1 presume the gentleman did not experience
any embarrassment at that time.
What will the farmer say at this time? Why, as
produce won't sell for as much as he formerly got
for it.
Here again I will give you my own practical
experience. My last year's crop brought me more
money than any one crop of the last three years.
The increased quantity more than made up for the
diminution of price. This is the case also with
many of my neighbors. I recently received a let-
ter from a farmer in my neighborhood, who in-
formed me that he had sold from his last year's
crop 437 dollars worth of hay; and that he had 4
or 5 tons yet to spare, wkirh would make it up 500
dollars. He had beside this.hi* wheat, corn, and oats
to sell, and he owns and works only about ninety
acres of land. We farmers know that when we
have an abundant crop (aH other things being
equal) the price will be lower than when the crop
is short. It is therefore not always the best times
for farmers when prices are very high, because it
is generally ewing to a short crop. It requires a
certain quantity of grain for the use of his family
and stock, and if he consumes it all, the high price
is of no advantage to him. We had better have
two hundred bushels of wheat at one dollar, than
one hundred at two dollars per bushel. For exam-
ple: say that it takes 50 bushels for bread and e>eed.
In that case we would hav 50 bushels left, at two
dollars, making #100, and in the pther ca^e we
would have 150 bu; hels left at $1, making $150.
But, sir, we are like other teen—we like big crops
and high prices too. We have, however, heard of
the country being ruined so often from the Oppo-
sition within tbe last few year.--, that we understand
their object,   You want, gentlemen, to get onr
votes, ?tid then you could control our rn ney, but
your Waij panic spee; he* fall still-bi rr ,ipon u,,
I will go o the laborer, ^ajs ihe ^enileman;
and what will he s..y? Why, I formerly got
money that answered my purpos°; but now I am
out ol employ, and ray family is starving.
Men starving in Pennsylvania! Sir, this ú
news to inr. I thought the complaint was that
gr;,ui was too low. This is certainly what was
said t) the farmets. Since a panic has been
attempted to be got up here, I have frequently
h-ard from home on ihe subject of lab'>r and
wages, and find that our meshanics are well em-
ployed in my immediate neghb.-rhood at former
pr < es.
This i , perhaps, an exception to the general
rule; and the reason is obvious. We have no bank
urar us, ntr have we any thing to do with them.
Every man keeps his own money, and no bank
marks our checks good wiihout paying the money.
We don't build, nor employ me hanics of any kind,
until we are able to pay for what we tetdone, with-
out going to b ink for ihe money. Our business is,
therefore, regu'ar. I have been watching the course
of events for the last few years, aiid have noticed
the changes and fluctuations that have taken place,
and am of the opinion that the embarrassment of
the country is owing to everaction by banks, or to
their unsteadiness in their accommodations to the
business community. I find generally, where men
are thrown out of employment, that it isforwaqt
of a continuance of bank accommodations to carry
on business. Too many of our business men de-
pend on bank loans to carry on their business; and
when that is withheld, they are compelled to discharge
their hands. It is a lamentable truth that the banks
have too much control over the business of the
country, and therefore can produce a panic at plea-
sure.
"I don't like hard money," says the gentleman.
"I would rather have paper; it don't wear out my
pocket so much. Why, shall the people be com-
pelled to buy silver to pay their debts? We have
too much gold and silver in this country. We have
erred in thi", as in every thing else. Fifty-five mil-
l.ons of your foreign debt is occasioned by the im-
portation of gold and silver. Send back your
fifty-five millions and pay your debts, on which you
have to pay $3,300,000 interest."
From the gentleman's account, we have erred
in this, then, said Mr. D. as in every thing
else: that is, we have committed an error by
bringing gold and silver into the country instead of
merchand se. Times change, and with them
gentlemen's opinions change. When Ihe gentle-
man received twenty thousand dollars for going
to England, as agent for the United States Bank to
bring in specie, it was all right to bring specie into,
the country; but now it is all wrong.
One thing I presume is certain; no man that
heard the gentleman will charge him with being a
hard money man. The only thing for our consider
ration, on this subject, is, was it better fjr the,
country to bring this mom y in gold and silver, or
merchandise? The States have crea ed stocks
since 1820, amounting to #174,696,994, and over
which the General Government have no control.
TKy lound their way to Europe. The above
amount was- all that was brought over in specie,
and the rest was brought over in merchandise.
One of the great evils that has afll cted this coun-
try, has been an over-importation, and yet the gen-
tleman would have imported fifty-five milkonsmore,
in preference to ihe precious metals. Such is his aver-
sion to hard monev. Perhaps this exportation of
hard money is advocated to justify tbe United
Stales Bank in exporting specie, as she has dope,,
to the amount of $8,712,000, in about fourteen
months. This seems to be carrying out the gentle?
man's princ pie in full. At the same time that the
gentleman advocated sending this fifty-five millions
of specie out of the country, he also advocated a
National Bank, as well as some six or eight other
gentlemen. Now, sir, I want to ask these gentle-
men whether their batik is to have a specie basis? 
and if so, where is it to come from? From the best
estimate that can be made from the statistics of tbe
country, the amount of gold and silver in tbe
United States is about eighty-five millions.   Of this,
