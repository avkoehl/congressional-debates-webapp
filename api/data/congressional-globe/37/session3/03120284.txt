I merely desire to say that T have offered my
amendment at this time for the purpose of having
it printed. I believe it is the intention of the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Spaulding,] to
address the committee to-day.
Mr. SPAULDING. This subject id a very dry
one, but it js an intensely interesting one at the
present time. I propose to discuss the bill reported
by the Committee of Ways end Means, with the
amendmcntof the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
so far as [ shall be able during the hour allotted to
me under tiie rules of the Bouse.
Mr. Chairman, the immediate requirements of
the Treasury are not !ess thdii §100,000,000. Be-
fore you can pas* thin bi'l through both Houses,
have it approved by th- President, and get bonds
and notea engraved, printed, and issued, at least
§50,000,000 inert' will bo required. Tho pressing
demands upon t'v Treasury between this: and the
first of next mouth, for the pay of soldiers and
other creditors, may be put down at §150,000,000.
The gold and silver in the banks in New York,
Boston,and Philadelphia on the 1st of this month
probably did not exceed $49,000,000; to which you
may add the gold and silver in all other banks m
all the loyal States, as will appear in official re-
ports to the 1st of January, 1363, and the whole
sum will not cxcced §87,000,000. All this coin
is necessary for the banks to take carc of their own
liabilities; but even if tlie Secretary of the Treas-
ury could, on the credit of thr Government, by a
sale of bonds at any sacrifice, or by the aid of the
military power, visit every bank in the country,
and by force compcl all this com to be paid into
the Tieasury, it would not pay fifty cents oa the
dollar of the demands due from the Government
and which ought to be paid in the next twenty
days. It is therefore pet fectly plain that even 'he
small sum of §150,000,000, now due, cannot be
paid in gold, it would be a great gratification to
me, and, [ doubt not, to every other loyal citizen,
if it were otherwise. It is no fault of the Secre-
tary or of Congress that gold cannot now be paid
to the soldiers and other creditors. It is simply
an impossibility, by any plan, to get enough for
that purpose. There never was a more pertinent
application of the old maxim than when applied to
our present condition, "when we cannot do as we
would, we must do as v/e can.'"
I h.ivc had a strong desire to provide money
upon a specie basis, for the support of tho Army
and Navy, during the pending struggle to pres-ci ve
file Constitution and tho national Union. 1 would
much prefjrto pay ^old and silver to all the credit-
ors of theGovei nmenf. During tho first six months
of the war, I was m hopes that our expenditures
might be kent within limits that would admit of
such a financial policy. I believe that this was the
earnest wKh of the Secretary of the Treasury
and of eveiy member of the Committee of "Ways
and Iv^canN. [jut with un at my m the field of from
sovv-n hundred thousand to one million of men, to
b-2 fed, clothed, and paid, and ail the material of
war provided to make them efficient for active duty,
it was \eiy soon ascertained that th° com in 'he
country, amounting oniv to about y250,000,000,
if cviry dollar neld by the banks and toe n<?"ph*
coiuc- have been availed of, v/a^1 I'm too small to
Diet"., these large expend nines. YV e e. mid no: shut
out- eyes to the vastness u£ tne \ oi n-n- of debt that
wus open before us. It was ve; v soon madcap-
parent that our national debt would, at an early
day, rcach §2,000,000,000, ec;ual to half the d°bt
