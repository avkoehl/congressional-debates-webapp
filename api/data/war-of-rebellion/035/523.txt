CINCINNATI, July 8, 1863.

General ROSECRANS,

Tullahoma, Tenn.:

It is reported Wheeler is in Kentucky to re-enforce Morgan. This is not on the best authority, but seems possible. Have you any information of his whereabouts, or of the cavalry commands that have been in your front?

Please give me the latest information you have. Morgan is now on the Ohio River, below Brandenburg.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE,

July 8, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel O. H. Moore telegraphs from Lebanon that General Wheeler has entered the State to support Morgan, who is now apparently retreating. General Manson telegraphs from Munfordville that his information is that Wheeler has entered the State and crossed one brigade over Green River, between Columbia and Campbellsville. Has any force of the enemy passed your left into Sequatchie Valley, and come via Jamestown into the State? No troops in Kentucky to meet any considerable force.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE,

General BURNSIDE:

Following just received:

TULLAHOMA, July 8.

Your dispatch is received. Wheeler is not in Kentucky. He has been in our front during Bragg's retreat, and is reported to have covered the rear when Bragg's army crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport day before yesterday. A part of his cavalry may be in the Sequatchie Valley, but it is not probable that he has gone to Kentucky.

W. S. ROSECRANS.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

TULLAHOMA,

July 8, 1863 - 10.45 p. m.

General BURNSIDE,

Cincinnati:

Wheeler is certainly below the Tennessee River. He has been in our front during all the late move; came very near being captured at Shelbyville.

Morgan, on the 28th of June, was at Greenville, 12 miles above Carthage, which is the latest intelligence we have of him.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
