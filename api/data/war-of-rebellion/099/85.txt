HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Beaufort, S. C., January 18, 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR, Jr.,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your dispatches of last night respecting reconnaissances have just been received. I think from General Sherman's letter that General Slocum has not pushed any force to Robertsville yet, and probably the Fourteenth Corps will start for that place from Savannah to-day. Your reconnaissances toward Salkehatchie are useful, and had better be kept up with a view to keeping the enemy in that vicinity. It would be well to make him destroy his bridges, pontoons, &amp;c., if possible. Please send me word as to the state of your rations and forage frequently.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S. -It is best not to push an infantry reconnaissance toward Robertsville at present.

O. O. H.,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Savannah, Ga., January 18, 1865.

Colonel H. C. RODGERS,

Chief of Staff, Left Wing:

COLONEL: My quartermaster reports great doubt as to his being able to procure the forage required to fill his trains by to-morrow morning. The forage is down the river on transports, and tug-boats have gone to tow them up, but when they will be up he is unable to report. To-morrow night our animals are out again.

I am, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Savannah, Ga., January 18, 1865.

GENERAL: As soon as the troops of your division now on post duty are relieved you will rejoin the corps at Purysburg, or wherever they may be, marching by the same route taken by the other divisions. The headquarters of the corps will be moved to Purysburg to-morrow morning.

By command of Brevet Major-General Williams:

ROBT. P. DECHERT,
