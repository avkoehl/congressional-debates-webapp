J               . insisted on a general principle, specious In appear
"ee, but unsound in its practical application they contended
that, where protection began, revenue must end As on ill us
nation, ta e the manufacture of iron suppose the country to
be dependent on importation *cr its supply, and suppose it to
be necessary fo>- tile wants of the Government to raise 850,000
Co tgress lays a tax on foreign iron which will amount to
$100 000 Foieign manufacturéis cannot stand this—no iron
comes m, and of course no duiy is collected Verytiue But
the rule was too broad There was a protection short of this,
which in its practical opeiation would increase consumption,
and not destroy revenue
If gentlemen bad put theirmaxim m these words, "wheie
prohibition  commences retenue ceases," they  would have
spoken the truth, but   that alteration would tumble  their
wholespecioUi theory to the ground    The just and proper
protection if our home industry would be effected by di^cn
'"mating  dutes     This mode   of protection had ever been
considered legitimate, it had everbeen m practice in this Go
vern i   nt, and malt other civilized Governments of the world
The only question was, how far these  discriminating duties
should be carried?   What foreign articles should we exclude?
What limita shall we assign to thern^   What domestic pro
d-icts should we cherish and foster?   Where should we begin,
and where «nould we end?   When this view of the matter
should be taken, hgnt would quickly break in, and the task of
legislation would become comparatively easy    Mr L was the
advocate of a protective tariff but he wanted some sensible
meaning to that term, he wanted such protection as could be
understood, he was for common sense in legislation
Mr h here observed that he was not unaware that ¿erg was
a collateral question, which was apt to interpose itself, and
which operated as an .mpediment to fair debate   It was that
which drew the line between North and South, which per
verted the judgment by mixing up lo-al prejudices with what
ought to be kept wh illy distinct from them   which went to
guide the decisions of a statesman and a leais ator bv chain
s-ndcompaas, and make him pursue the diieetmu u( peosra

<" juld not stand on neutral ground, where he desired to stand,
then, upon general principles he mu3t give the preference to
the free laboi of the North    It was agaio&t reason, against the
t a me of th«ii£i-, tuexpect that the slave was to be olaced upon
'h" footing of the freeman whose labor wasexpencied m tilling
' is own soil    Did gentlemen expect such a man was by law to
be reuueed to the level of a slave'   Did gentlemen think by any
legislation to effect a lesult like this?   Coul I they imagine that
the ireemen of the NorLh would ever submit to be put on a

Mr LINN replied that he had not charged southern gentle-

" T were mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the God."
I they were taken in by these political tiappers, they wou'd

complished, they would turn tail and desert then  They
would thti return to the Wishes and interests of their own
constituents, anti leave their duped allies to shift ho  they

do nothing which would not subserve the Constitution, and pro
mote the tiuemterests of their country
Mr RAYJVER disclaimed any intention of travelling out of
the true and simple question before the House to discuss the
tariff The question was one oí reference, and « would be
wholly immaterial Were it not a test Cuestión to ascerta n the
feeling ard purpose of that House as to a tariff The gende
man from JNew York [Mr Ll'oi) might affect to scout the idea
of its being a test question, yet sjch it must be It was
purely a test question Jilse, how did it happen that all the
gentlemen who had advocated a reference to the Committee
onManufactuics and approved and advocated a pro ective
tariff, made an issue between the North and the South, and
lugged the subject of slavery into the debate, uninvited by
any southern nun"! He hoped not to hea' on this occas on
the insolent charge repealed that SoutnerH gentlemen invited
and pressed on the House a comparison of the merits of fiee
and slave labor That could not be said now The South stood
on the vantage ground this time of ihe party auacked and,
finding himself in that position, he should hurl back the mis
siles with which he was assailed, and try to give them aug
mented force It mattered little to what committee this portion
of the message should be sent, or what son ofareportmight
be made upon it, The House was not committed. They
would not be obliged to approve of the report The country
looked that the permanent future policy of this Government m
regard to the tai iff should be settled at the present session of
Congress, and they would look to the decision of the present
question asan indication of v,hat might be expected
It the proposed incieasp of duties on imports was to be strictly
to meet the exigencies of the Treasury growing out of a deft
tit m the revenue, then Mr R said he was willing lo go not
mere y to tne utrntst limits of tho compromise act ano lay a
dutyoi 26 per cent but he would increase it to 30, to 40, or to
100 per cen if the honor and ihe actual wants of tne country

\\ able as that which insisted on sending ¡tto the Committee
on Manufactures Now, gentlemen might disagree on auhor-
dmate points, but the mam object, viz revenue, should be ever
kept m view They might as well refer a clause toucrang
th  increase of the army to the Committee on the Territories,
because more troops might ptoteM the frontier Gentlemen
should remember that then argument cut both ways, it was
a two edged sword, and they should be careful how thet han-
dled it
The gentleman from New York [Mr JJsrNjhad disclaimed
all hostility to the South, and had expressed himself as opposed
to drawing lines between North and South Mr R entirely
agreed with him, but unfortunately the gentleman's premises
and his conclusions were wide apart The orly tenable- groarjfl
in this matter of duties Was to h&veall the various interests of
the countiy to rely on their individual exertions If they pro-
tected tobacco, they would find themselves striking at some
other interests The gentleman from Maryland [Mr Sollbrs]
had looked at the national honor, but if he looked a little closer
into his heart, perhaps he would find there self interest over-
ruling all other considerations That gentleman had been for
high duties on silks and wines, on cloths and linens, now possi-
bly he might find that his Northern friends who went so strong
for piotecting home industry would nof relish very high duties
on these things, because they did not compete so much with
domestic manufactures They would piobably prefer taxes
that more directly protected themselves Thus it was, the mo-
ment we legis ated for one we came against another Let gen-
tlemen rather refer the matter to a committee which went for
neither, but wassupf osed to be unbia-ed
The tariff was to be raised to supply revenue, this was the
ground taken by all Now the first question was, how much
is needed for this purpose? And how would gentlemenget at the
answer? From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
And to what committee had that report been referred To the
Committee on Manufactures No, bat to the Committee of
Ways and Means The lequisite information was nowíieíóre
that committee, and the subject should go where the informa-
tion was
Bu the House had been told that tin- subject should go to
the Committee on Manufactures hecause the Committee of
Ways and Means had-o much business before it No doubt
it had, but what business could be of greater importance than
tins'
[Here some explanations passed between Mr R and Mr
Fili more, chairman ol the committee, who denied having
evei relu ed to take chaige of the subject 1
No doubt the gentltr^an's objection, from the mass of bust
ness, had arisen fiom hi  sreat modesty but would the House
 eheve the gePtleman and his committee from the -more
wei'htf-subject, that they might have time to attend to what
was of less motn*iiO
As to the argument iruhi precedents, it had little weight
Adm.tmg that ihe subject of the lauT had always heretofore
gone to the Committee i n Manufactures, we were now under
anew po'iticaldispensation 411 ptevious tariff laws, froml
18i9, Vih"ii this committee was first raised down to 1833, had
been tariff- for piOtecjtn Trite, this idea was kept out of
sisht in the tules of tne bills and the existence of a nationa
debt furnished a icady excuse for passing them, but the debt
was under speedy liquidation, and al) those laws were clearly
for the protection of manufat ture- Tinder such circumstances
it «da right to «end the tariff to ihe Committee on Manufac-
tures but since then a compromise act had passed, and rt
looked to the ultnnateabandonment of the principle of protec-
tion, audit pioposeda ui form duty of 20 per cent unless
more slnuld oer peded for an economical administration of the
Go%ernment The «reat question now was this Shall we ad-
heie to the principles of the compromise act, or shall we re-
turn to the doctrine of protection!
Mr R aos ained f'om entering on the question of the tariff;
and when he spoke cf a uniform dutv of 20 per cent he did
no' wish to be understood as being ir favor of what what was
called a u homomal tariff," he thought there should be some
exceptions But still the question was whether to adhere to
the compromise act, or go back to the exploded doctrine of
proux ion                                                               ,         .
Mi   R said he was opposed to discriminating duties for pro-
tection   He did not envy the manufacturing interest, nor would
he de¡ ave them of the inciden al protection which they must
v a*oio blv nerve from a uniform duty     They, and they
aione, wo iid oe pioteited by tliatt'ui     if 20per cent was

l^ast  it was a n ooted po nt whether other interests would
