It is reported that Hood's entire army reached Town Creek to-day and expects to cross the river at Bainbridge to-night. I have this from such a source that I cannot doubt its truth. I will do what I can to prevent their crossing, keeping you fully advised.

GENERAL: The following dispatch was received at this office from the roadmaster at Nashville, October 28:

Two of the robbers, Buck Smith and Taylor, came into Fountain Head, where section men were working, and took them out a mile from the road and robbed them and threatened to kill if they were caught working on the road again. They struckt two of the men over the heads with their pistols and cut them pretty badly. What is to be done? I will not be able to keep any men at work on this end of the road.

NISWANGER.
