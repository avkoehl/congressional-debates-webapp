HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,Jericho Mills, May 27, 1864-12.50 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The rear of the corps has just crossed the bridge, and everything has passed quietly. The roads have been very heavy so far, and are said to be worse for the next mile, when they improve. The marching has thus far been slow in consequence. Will the major-general commanding inform me whether he expects the corps to be kept moving till it reaches Hanovertown, or whether a rest of, say, three hours can be taken after daylight? Without such a rest I fear the straggling will be excessive. I except to meet my supply trains at Chesterfield Station and to halt long enough to issue rations.

I think it would be advisable, therefore, to move in the morning at daylight, so that the direction of our march could not be seen from the other side.

Very respectfully,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

My headquarters are on the road, left-hand side, at McDowell's house.
