The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
will lay before the Senate a joint resolution from
the House of Representatives.
The joint resolution (H. R. No. 120) imposing
a special income (luty was read the,first time by
its title.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The second
rending of the joint resolution 
Mr. CHANDLER. I object.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection be-
ing made, it cannot be read the second time.
Mr. SHERMAN. Is it in order to'move to
postpone all other business and take up that joint
resolution?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The joint res-
olution is before the Senate, but no action can be
had on it until it lias been read the second time.
Mr. SHERMAN. It will be the unfinished
business on Monday .morning.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be.
HOUR OF MEETING.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that when the Sen-
ate adjourns it be to meet at nine o'clock on Mon-
day morning.
Mr. SUMNER. Does no|gthat require an al-
teration of the rule? The habit of the Senate
when it changes its hour of meeting from twelve
o'c^ck to eleven has always been to adopt a res-
olution which lies on the table a day or two.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That has been
the usual practice.
Mr. SUMNER. My impression is that the
rule requires our meeting to be at noon, and that
it cannot be at any other hour than at noon with-
out a change of the rule.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no
rule upon the subject; but the usual practice has
been to give notice.
Mr. SHERMAN. I submit the motion.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator
from Ohio moves that when the Senate adjourns
it be to meet on Monday at nine o'clock a. m.
The motion was agreed to.

by inserting after the word " otherwise" the following:
"except on the last day of any session, when bills and joint

Mr. CHANDLER. I object.
The PUESIDEiNT pro tempore. The resolu-
tion \yiil lie over, objection being made.

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Saturday, July 2, 18G4.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer
by the Chaplain, Rev. W. H. Channing.
The Clerk proceeded with the reading of the
Journal of yesterday. After some progress the

APPLICATION FOR USB OF THIS HALL.
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication from Thomas B. Florence, chairman
of a committee of arrangements, stating that citi-
zens, residents, and sojourners in the cities of
Washington and Georgetown and vicinity had
determined to celebrate the 4th of July in the
western grounds surrounding the Capitol under
the auspices of the National Democratic Associa-
tion, and soliciting the consent of the House of
Representatives to occupy the Hall of the House
in case the day should be intensely ligt or other-
wise inclement.
Mr. COX. I move that therequest begranted.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
there is a possibility that the House may be in
session.
Mr. COX. It is only in case the House be not
in session that the request is asked.
Mr. STEVENS. I think this whole thing is
very improper. I hope that the Senate will agree
to-day to adjourn on Monday at twelve o'clock.
But I think that this Hall should be reserved for
the discharge of the business incumbent upon us,
and that no further notice should be taken of this
very improper application.
Mr. COX. I will say to my friend from Penn-
sylvania that this very polite request is made
only in case the House shall not be in session on
Monday.
Mr. MORRILL. I understand that it is quite
certain that the Senate will not be able to adjourn
until Monday. It would be therefore improper
to grant the request.
Mr. STEVENS. I think we cannot agree
to it.
Mr. COX. Tt is only on condition the House
will not be in session.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. I do not think it
is a proper use to apply the Hall of this House
to. I am opposed to its being used for any such
purpose.
Mr. COX. The gentleman from Maryland
should have made his speech and given'his vote
when the Hall was used Tor other purposes.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. My speech! I
never made any in this Hall except on legislative
subjects.
Mr. COX. I did not mean that. I meant your
vote to allow this Hall to be used for other pur-
poses.  
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. I never voted to
allow any one to use this Hall.
Mr. COX. 1 am glad to hear the' gentleman
say so, and to see that he does not agree with that
side of the House.
Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay the whole sub-
ject on the table. â€¢
The motion was agreed to.
PAY Of STAFF OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
ask the House to pass a joint resolution amenda-
tory of the joint resolution of 20th May last, pro-
viding that staff officers on the staff of the Lieu-
tenant General shall be entitled to the same pay
and emoluments as staff officers of the same grade
on the staffs of corps commanders. It turns out
that there is one marl on the staff of the Lieutenant
General, Major Dent, who is a major in the regu-
lar service, but a major of infantry, and the Comp-
troller has decided that he does not come wiihin
the law. All the others get cavalry pay, while he
gets only infantry pay. I hold in my hand a joint
resolution to correct the error, and I ask the
House to pass it now.
No objection being made, the joint resolution
received its several readings, and was engrossed
and passed.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, moved tore-
consider the vote by which the joint resolution
was passed; and also moved to lay the motion to
reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
TRADE WITH ltEBEL STATES.
Mr. FENTON, under the authority heretofore
granted to the Committee of Ways and Means
to report back at any time, reported from the said
committee bill of the Senate No. 232, in addition
to the several acts concerning commercial inter-
course between the loyal and insurrectionary
States, and to provide for the collection of cap-
tured and abandoned property,and the prevention
of frauds in States declared m insurrection.
Mr. FENTON. 1 desire to make a verbal cor-
rection or'amendment in lines four and five in the
