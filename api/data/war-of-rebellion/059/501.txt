KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

Your division must be at its destination by the 1st of May. This can be accomplished by the use of such cars as can be spared for the purpose. I will place one or more trains at your disposal. Let each detachment be carried only so far that it can march the remainder of the distance by the time specified.

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General JUDAH,

Strawberry, Plains:

I desire, if practicable, to regulate your march so as to reach Charleston the 30th. This will require that you march some distance beyond Knoxville to-morrow. Provision has been made for storing the overcoats of your men and issuing the required shoes. I think you will be able to arrange all of your business here and make the desired march.
