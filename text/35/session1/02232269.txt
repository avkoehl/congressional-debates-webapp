doing this you enable each community to take
care of its own poor. By doing this you destroy
and break down the great propensity that exists
with men to hang; and loiter and perish about the
cities of the Union, as is done now in the older
countries.
It is well enough, Mr. President, to see where
our public lands have been going. There seems
to be a'great scruple now in reference to the ap-
propriation of lands for the benefit of the people;
but the Federal Government has been very lib-
eral heretofore in granting lands to the States for
railroad purposes. We can pass law after law,
making grant after grant of the public lands to
corpoiations, without alarming any one here. - We
have already granted to railroad monopolies, to
corporations, twenty-four million two hundred
and foity-seven thousand acres. Those grants
hardly meet with opposition in Congress; but it
seems to be very wrong, in the estimation of
some, to grant lands to the people on the condi-
tions proposed in the bill before us. We find,
furthermore, that there have been granted to the
States, as swamplands—and some of these lands
"Will turn out to be the most productive on the
globe—forty million one hundred and thirty-three
thousand five hundred and sixty-five acres.
In relation to the public lands, and the grants
which have been made by the Government, 1 have
obtained from the Commissioner of the General
Land Office scvcial tables, which 1 now submit.

Tho table giving; the estimated quantity of all onr
public lands", shows the feasibility of the plan in
favor of winch I have been speaking. I know
that some gentlemen from the southern States ob-
ject to this bill because they fear that it will carry
emigrants from the free States into those States.
We'll, sir, on this point [ have drawn some con-
clusions from figures, which I will present to the
Senate. In the State of Alabama there are now
undisposed of eighty-three million five hundred
and thirty-three thousand quarter sectionSof land.
I ask my southern friends, would it not be better
if a man in the State of Alabama would select a
quarter section there, and take the two hundred
dollars it would have cost him, and expend it
there, even though it might be inferior land, than
to compel him to pay #1 25 an acre, and emigrate
from the Slate of Alabama to a place where he
could get better land r If you compel him to pay
the higher price, it becomes his interest to leave
his native State; but by permitting hinn.to take the.
land and expend on its improvement what he
would otherwise have to pay, and what it would
cost him to move, the chances are that he will
remain where he is. In the State of Mississippi
there are thirty-four thousand four hundred and
ninety-six quarter sections; in Louisiana, thirty-
seven thousand; in Arkansas, ninety-seven thou-
sand; in Florida, one hundred and twelve thou-
sand. Altogether, the quarter sections of public
lands belonging to the Government amount to six
million nine hundred and twenty thousand. How
feasible the plan is. I have shown, too, that it
would take over six hundred years to dispose of
the public lands at the rate we have been dispos-
ing of them, and that if you take one million
1 quarter sections and have them settled and culti-
vated, you will obtain more revenue, and you
will enhance the remaining public lands more
than the value of those the Government gives.
| I live in a southern State; and, if I know my-
self, I am as good a southern man as any one who
lives withinlhe Borders of the South. It seems :
to be feared that by this bill we compel men to go
on the lands. 1 want to compel no man to go. I
want to leave each and evei y man to be controlled
by his own inclination, by his own interest, and
not to force him *, but is it statesmanlike, is it phil-
anthropic, is it Chi istian, to keep aman m a State,
and refuse to let him go, because, if he does go,
he will tend to populate some other portion of the
country? if a man lives m the county in which
I live, and he can, by crossing the line into an-
other county, better his condition, I say let him
go. If, by crossing the boundary of my State and
ji going into another, he can better his condition, I
,; say let him go. 1 f a man can go ftom Tennessee
,1 into Illinois, or Louisiana, or Mississippi, or Ark-
j| ansas, or any other State, and better his condition,
let him go. I care not where he goes, so that he
|! locates hhnseif in this great area of freedom, be-
i' comes attached to our institutions, and interested
'! in the prosperity and welfare of the country. I
'i care not where he goes, so that he is under the
! | protecuon of our stars and stripes. 1 say let him
;i go wheie he can better the condition of himself,
his wife, and children; let him go wheie he can
receive the gieatest remuneration for his toil and
for his labor. What kind of a policy is it to say
that a man shall be locked up where he was born,
and shall be confined to the place of his birth?
Take the State of North Carolina, represented by
thehonorable Senator beforeme, [Mr.ClIntgmax]
—and 1 have no doubt it is his intention to rep-
resent that people to their satisfaction—would it
have been proper to require the people of North
Carolina, from her early settlement to the present
time, to be confined within hei boundaries? Would
they not have looked upon it as a hard sentence 3
Would they not have looked upon it as oppressive
\ \ and cruel ? North Carolina has supplied the west-
|! em States with a large proportion of her popula-
i' tion, for the reason that by going West they could
[j better their condition. Who would prevent them
]I ftom doing it? Who would say to the poor man
]j in North Carolina, that has no land of las own to
h cultivate, that lives upon some barren angle, or
! | some piny plain, or in some other State upon some
!| stony ridge, that he must plow and dig the place
:i appointed to him by his landlord, and" that he is
ji not to emigrate where he can better ins condition?
I! What is his prospect? He has to live poor; he
has to live hard; and, in the end, when he dies,
ji povei ty, want, is the only inheritance he can leave
S his children. There is no one who has a higher
appreciation of North Carolina than 1 have; she
is mv nativ State. I found it to be my interest
to emismn , and I should have thought it cruel
and hard if I had been toid ihat I could not leave
her boundary. Although North Caiolinadid not
afford me the advantages of education, though I
cannot speak in the language of the schoolmen,
and call her my cherishing mother, yet, in the
language of Cowper, " with all her faults, I love
her still." She is still my mother; she is my
native State; and I love her as'such, and i-]ow
her people, too. But what an idea-is it t© present*
as influencing the action of a statesman^ tfeaVpeo-
pie may not emigrate from one State to another!
Sir,Isay letuman goanywhere within theboim#-
aries of the United States where he can better his;
condition. '
Mr'. President, if I entertained the notions,that-
some of my friends who oppose this bill do, L
should be a more ardent advocate of the *poli<5y
thaii I am now, if that were possible. My friend
from Alabama [Mr. Clay] entertains somestrang<r
notions in reference to Democracyand the people;
and in his speech on the fisheries bill, he gave this
proposition a kind of side blow, a lick by indirec-
tion I do not object to that; but if 1 entertained
his opinions I should be a more determined and
zealous advocate of the policy of this bill than I
am now, if that were possible. In his speech upon
the Lecornpton constitution that Senator, m speak-
ing of the powers of the convention which framed
the constitution, said:
" In my opinion, they would have acted m stricter ac-
cordance with the spi lit and genius of our institutions if they
had not submitted it in whole oi in part to the popular vote.
Our governments ate Republics, not democracies:. The peo-
pt^ exercise their sovereignty nut m person at the ballot-
box. but through agents, delegates, or representatives. Onr
fatheis founded republican Government? in preference to
Democracies, not so much because it would be lmpiaeuca-
hie a* because it would be unwise and inexpedient f<>rthe
people themselves' to assemble and adopt laws."
I have always thought the general idea had been
that it was not practicable to do everything in a
strict democratic sense, and that it was more con-
venient for the people to appear through their del-
egates. But the Senator said further:
u Thev were sati>fied, from reading and reflection, of the
truth oi Mr. Madron's observation about pure dmnot-racies,
that they* have ever been speetaelo>. oi turbulence and con-
tention ; have ever been found incompatible with Jjersonal
secuuty,or the rights of property; and have in general been
as : hort in their lives a-j they have b en violent in their
dcathv.' They knew fiom the examples tin ni&hed by Greece
and Italy, that u is impossible, m a pine democracy, to re-
move the causes oi control the efFcets of taction ; that an
absolute inajoriry is oftener swayed by pits-iou tb « by rea-
son ; that ns voice us oftener that of ademon than of a God;
that u i  the hum cinel. lapacious, intolerant, and intoler-
able of all ijiant>. They knew that it U a wholly it respons-
ible pov\ei; acknowledging no superior, for U is it>elf
siipieme; o\vm« no obedience, font is its own master; re-
specting no authority, for it is a law unto u-elf; subject to
no control or lestiamt, except the still small voice of con-
science, which is too often diowned in the tumultuous
waves of patry or of faction. It nwrht sacrifice public good
or private rights to any \ ulnig pulsion oi mtei en. of the hour,
with impunity. It had lobiied ihe nch to relieve the poor,
and oppressed the poor to aggiandi/e the rich, with equal
ardoi or indifference. It had voted hemlock to-day and
statues to morrow, to its bebt citizens. They suffered no
man to be a judge in J i& own case, lest he should be biased
by passion, or by interest; and could find no better reason
whv a huge body of men, although a majority, should be
the suoreme and final aihnerof us cause. On the con-
trary, they knew that a large body of men is more liable to
be contioiled by passion or by iutere>t than a single indi-
vidual, and is morctpt to sacrifice the rights of the minority,
because it can ne done with more impunity. Hence they
endeavored to impose restraints upon themselves. Hence
they committed the making of all then law.*, organic or
municipal, to their delegate* or lepiesentaiives, whose
ciuncs they could punish, who*e error? they could correct,
and whose powers they could reclaim.
'•The gieat security of our rights of life, liberty-, and
property, is in the responsibility ot those who make and of
those who pxecute the law. K-tabh-h as a punciple that
to give sanction to law, it must be appioved by a majority
at the ballot-box. and you take awav this security and sur-
rendei those rights to the most capricious, lapacious. and
ctuti of tyrants, f regret to see the giowing ,-pmt in Con-
gics& and tluou^hout the country to demociahze our Gov-
ernment; io submit eveiv question, whether pertaining to
oigainc or municipal laws, to the vote of the people. This
is sheer radicalism ; n i-> the Red Republicanism of revolu-
aonniy Fiance, which appealed to the soctions on all ocea-
sions-j'and not the Ametican Republicanism of our fathers.
Their Republicanism was {.table and conservative; "this is
mutable and revoUitiouaiy. Then.- aflordcd a shield for
the nmioutj; this give* a swoul to the maiouty. Theirs
defended the rights uf the weak ; tins suirenders them to
the power or the strong. God foibid thai the demagogueism
of t)n-i dav 'jhoukl prevail over the philanthropic and philo-
sophic statesmanship of our fathers."
In the same speech, the Senator said:
"Property is the foundation of everv social fabric. To
preserve, protect, and perpetuaie rights of property, society
is formed, and government is framed."
Now, if I entertained these notions, I should un 
questionably go for the homestead bill. 1 am free
to say, here, that I do not hold the doctrine ad-
vanced by the honorable gentleman from Ala-
bama, to the extent that ho goes. I believe the
people are capable of self-government. I think
they have demonstrated so most clearly; -and I do
no* think the Senator's history of deituxfraey
