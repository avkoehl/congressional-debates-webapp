We expect to be troubled for some time to come, as our force here is quite light. Mouton is reported as being 2,000 strong. This place will be defended to the last. The negro troops will be sent this p. m.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

THOS. S. DENNETT,

Captain, and Assistant Quartermaster.

I have ordered all our sick brought this side, and have telegraphed to Colonel Holmes to know the exact state of the case, and why he does not telegraph himself.
