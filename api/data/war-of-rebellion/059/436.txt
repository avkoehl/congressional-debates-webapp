ED. D. SAUNDERS,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, April 21, 1864.

ADJUTANT GENERAL:

Major General Carl Schurz is thrown out by the combination of the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps. I cannot assign him to a division in any of my armies without displeasing some one who has long been identified with their command.

General Schurz would like the command in West Kentucky, but that is given by General Grant to General Prince. Do you know of any command to which he may be properly assigned, as he is very anxious to remain on duty?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding.
