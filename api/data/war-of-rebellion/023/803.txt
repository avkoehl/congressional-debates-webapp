HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 8, 1862.

Colonel JOHN S. SCOTT,

Commanding Kirby Smith's Cavalry Brigade, Frankfort, Ky.:

SIR: General Smith directs me to say that the body of Lieutentant-Colonel Topping, Seventy-first Indiana, has been sent for and will be sent to Frankfort as soon as possible. In the mean time he directs that the lieutentant and two citizens who came with the flag of truce be kept at the pickets. He trusts that the flag was not permitted to come into the town of Frankfort, as should never be done. The general hopes that your command left yesterday on the expedition proposed by him to you, as otherwise it will probably be too late to accomplish the object desired. If it has not as yet left he wishes you get it off immediately. He thinks the infantry force will be at Shelbyville on its return on about the 17th instant. If Starnes' cavalry has not left the general wishes five companies, under the command of a field officer, to be ordered here at once. If it has left, directs that the whole regiment out its return be ordered to this post. It is reported to the commanding officer that there are large quantities of supplies at Lebanon, which the enemy will undoubtedly attempt to carry off to Louisville by the railway.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 8, 1862.

Colonel JOHN S. SCOTT,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that if you are still in Frankfort you send Colonel Starnes' regiment to this place to report to these headquarters. The enemy evacuated Lebanon on Saturday, and if your expedition in that direction has not started it is now too late. You will send strong parties into the counties between you and the Ohio River, even to the Ohio, to protect the volunteers now raising there for our service and to observe the enemy. You will report frequently the position of your troops and your observation.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 8, 1862.

COMMANDING OFFICER RICHMOND, KY.:

SIR: It is rumored that some of General Morgan's forces are trying to make their way from Cumberland Gap to the Ohio. The general commanding directs that your cavalry be kept well advanced on the London and Irvine roads to report any movements in those directions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
