pensions of widows and orphans.
On motion by Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, the
Senate proceeded to consider, as in Committed of
the Whole, the bill for five years' pensions to the
widows and orphans of soldiers of the United
! States.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment.
Mr. HUNTER. I should like to hear Some
further explanation of the bill.
Mr. D*4VIS, of Mississippi. I will make a
I brief explanation. It is to place the widows and
1 orphans of soldiers upon the same footing with the
widows and orphans of sailors in the Navy. The
Senate will remember that originally, out of a
Navy fund which had accrued during the war of
i 1812, pensions were provided for widows and or-
phans of sailors. That was long since expended,
and subsequent legislation has made it a charge
upon the Treasury. It is believed that widows
and orphans of soldiers have equal, if not higher,
claims to such an allowance than those of sail-
ors, mainly for the reason that the compensa-
tion of soldiers is somewhat lower, and they have
no opportunity of obtaining prize money or enter-
ing into other pursuits, and acquire a competency
which they may leave to their widows and chil-
dren, in the event of their death. The bill which
I introduce is prospective, except the last section,
which provides for a class of cases, every one oi"
which, I suppose, has heretofore been covered by
a special act. It provides for the cases of widows
and orphans of soldiers. As far back as the 7th
of May, 1846, at the declaration of war against
Mexico, it will be remembered that we had a spe-
cial law covering these cases, and there have been
special acts for cases not coming exactly under the
law, until, I suppose, there are very few cases,
or none, not covered by that section which
have not been covered by a special law. If it be
any objection in the mind of any one, I am quite
willing that it should be striken out. The rest of
the bill is prospective, so as to secure a five years'
pension to the widow and minor children of a sol-
dier who died in the service. I do not suppose it
necessary to go into any detail to prove to the
Senate that the compensation we give to the offi-
cers and soldiers cannot enable them to make any
provision for their widows and children if they
die in the service.
It was well said ty the Duke of Wellington that,
every military service must be put upon one of
two bases: either upon small pay, with certain
provisions for the future, or pay sufficiently large
to enable the individual to provide for the future
wants of his family. We have adopted the for-
mer. Our pay is very small, belew that of any
other situation in the country. It is well known
that an officer in the Amy can throw up his com
mission at any time, ana receive a greater com-
pensation for his services in other employments.
The same is true with regard to the private soldier,
who has served the country faithfully in many dis-
tricts of the United States at seven and eight
dollars a month, while the common laborer re-
ceives from eighteen to twenty. All these con-
siderations, as we do not intend to change the
great scale or rate of compensation, are sufficient
to justify the passage of such a bill as this.
Mr. HUNTER. As I understand the case, so
far as the naval officers are concerned, their wid-
ows and orphans are paid out of a fund they
themselves raised. It is true that fund was dissi-
pated by an improvident act of legislation, the
consequences of which were not perceived at the
time; and that having been done through the indis-
; cretion of Congress, the Government thought
proper to make it up to naval officers. Such I un-
derstand to be the case. This bill is, therefore,
doing something more than putting Army officers
on the same footing with naval officers. If it
passes we are contributing directly to make pen-
sions, while in the other case Congress was only
restoring a fund which they had dissipated.
Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi. It is no matter
how the naval fund was procured for the benefit
of the widows and orphans of naval officers.
They stand now on the same footing as before it
was taken from them, and the object of this bill is
to make the cases somewhat equal in regard to the
widows and orphans of those who have died in
the Army and of those who have died in the Navy.
It is now doubly unjust, because the pay, in the
first place, is not equal, and then there is no fund
provided.
Mr. UNDERWOOD. I submit a proposition
to amend that bill for the purpose of ascertaining
the sense of the Senate on a particular point. I
perceive, from reading the bill, that it provides
pensions not only for the widows and orphans of
those who shall have been killed in battle, or shall
have died from wounds received in battle, but for
the widows and orphans of those who may have
died, or shall die, from diseases contracted in the
public service. It does seem to me that that is an
enlargement of our pension system beyond all
reason. I am somewhat opposed, Mr. President,
I confess, to this enlargement of the pension sys-
tem of the country; and I do not see any good
reason why the officers and soldiers of the Army
or the Navy shall be pensioned, more than those
individuals who have worn out themselves in the
â¢ service of the country in civil life. We have mem-
