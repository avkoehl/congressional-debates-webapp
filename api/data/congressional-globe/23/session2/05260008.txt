8                                              THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.-                        December 3,
cuted under State authority, assuming that Con-
giess have the light to do so, were stated in my
annual message to Congress in 1830, and tlso m
that containing my objections to the Maysville
road bill
So thotoughlyconvinced ami that no such ap-
propriations ought to be made by Congress until
a suitable constitutional provision is made upon
the subject, and so essentnl do I regard the
point to the highest inteiests of our country,that
I could not consider myself as discharging my
duty to my constituents 'in giving the executive
sanction to any bill containing such an appio,.nia-
tion If the people of the United States desne
that the public Tieasuiy shall bo íesorted to for
the mean  to piosecute such works, they will
concur in an amendment of the Constitution,
prescribing a lule by which the national charac-
ter of thewoiks is to be tested, and by which the
gieatest practicable equality of benefits miy bt
secuiedto each membei of theConfedeiacy The
effects of such a íesiilation would be most silu-
tary in preventing unpiofitable expenditmes, in
securing our legislation fiom the pernicious eon
sequences of a sciamblefoi the f Ivors of Goi em-
inent, and in icpicssing the spuit of discoiittiit
which must inevitably ins" fiom an u icquil dis
tribution of tioasuies which belong alike to all
Theie is anothei class of appropmtioos for
what may be called, without impropiiety, intei
nal nnpiovements, which have always bcei re
garded as standing upon diflcient giouuds fiom
those to which I have íeteiied Ialludi to such is ¡
have for then object the improvement of oui hir
bors, the lemoval of partial and tempoi iry ob-
structions m oui navig ible i ivcis, for the facility |
and secunty of oui foiei^n commrice The
grounds upon «Inch 1 distinguished appiopm
-lions of this chaiartei fiom othtrs have ¡ihcidv I
been stated to Congiess I will now only add
that, at the fust session of Congrí ss undei the
new Constitution, it was provided by law, that
all expenses which should aociue from and after
the fifteenth day of August, 1789, in the neces-
sary suppoitand maintenance and lepaus of all
light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers,
erected, placed, oi sunk befo ethe passage of ihe
act, within any bay, ml< t, haiboi, or poit of the
United States, ionondcrmg the navigation there
of easy and safe, should be defrayed out of the
Treasury of the United States, md fmtl ei, that
it should be the duty of the Seen tary of the
Treasury to piovidi by conflicts, with the ap-
probation of the Piesidi nt, foi lebuildmg \i lien
necessaiy and kieping in good irpau the light-
houses, biaeons, buoys, and public piers in the
soveial States, and foi tinnishiiig them wit i sup-

bem continued fiom that time to the piescnt
without niteiniption oi dispute As a natui il
consequence of themciease and extension of oui
foieign commeice, poits of entry and di liveiy
have been multiplied and established, not only
upon our seaboaid, but in the inteiioi of the
countiy, upon oui lakes and navigable riveis
The convenience and safety of this commerce have
led to the giadual extension of these expendi-
tures, to the erection of light-houses, the placing,
planting, and sinking of buojs, beacons, «md
pieis, and to the íemo-ial of putial and tempo
rary obstiuctions m oui nivnrable rivers, and in
the haibors upon oui groat lakes, as well as on
the seaboaid Although I have ixpiesscd to
Congress my apprehension that these expendí
tures have sometimes been extravagant and dis-
propoitionate to the advantages to bi domed
from them, I hate not felt it to be my duty to íc-
fuse my assent to billscontam lg them,andli ne
contented myself to follow in this íesptct m the
footsteps of allmy piedeccssors Sensible, how-
ever, from expencnoe and observition, of the
gieat abuses to which the umestncted excicise
of this authonty by Congress was expo&ed, I
have prescribed a limitation for the government
dfmyown conduct, by which expenditmes of
this character are confined to places below the
poits of entry or delivery established by law
I am very sensible that this restriction is not as
satisfactory as could be^desired, and that much
embarrassment may be caused to the executive
department in its execution, by appiopnations
for remote and not w ell understood object;,. But as
| neilher my own leflections, nor the lights which I
may  properly  derive  from othei sources, have
j supplied me with a better, I shall continue to
apply my best exe tions to a futhful application
of the rul-1 upon which it is founded     I sinceiely
| regret that I could not give my assent to the bill
entitled" An act to nnpiove thenawgation of the
Wabash iivei," hut I could not hive done so
without receding from thegiound which I hue,
upon the fullest consideiation, taken upon this
subject, and of which Congicss has been hot to
foi e apprised, and without tin owing the subj ct
again open to abuses which no good citizen,
entertaining my opinions, could desne
I íely upon the intelligence and candor of my
fcllow-citizcns,m whose libenl indulgence 1 h vie
aheady so largciy puticipited foi a corieet ap-
preciation of my motives in inteiposmg, is I hive
done, on this, and otluw occasions, checks to a
comse of legislation which, without in the slight
est degiee calling in question the motives of otln is,
I considei as sanctioning impiopei and unconsti-
tutional expenditures oí public tieasure.
[ am not hostile to internal impiotcmcnts,and
wish to sie hem ext nded to eicry put of the
countiv, but I am full/ persuaded, if th"y ate

NLWSPAPDRS  FOR SEP.ATORS
The  resolution submitted yesteiday  by Mi
Knight, lelatue to authorizing a subscription foi
newspapeisfoi theusc of the membeis, was taken
up for consideration
Ml  KING, of Georgia, said that,uponmquiiy,
he found that icsolutions similn to the piesent,
j and  for the  same  object,  had   been frequently
| passed by both Houses of Congiess, md with so
| little mtciiuption, heietofoie, that it now consti
tuted  a íegulai   piacticc     At one time it was
admitted that it was a veiy impioper ore, and,
I notwithstanding the continuinci of the practice,
ltwas still equally so     He hoped thitsome gen
t'eman v>ho was in favor of it would show some
leasonablc connection between the   propriety of
the piactiee of punting  the documents of the
Senate and subsci lhing for the \ anous ncwspapei s
of the day, or any of the fashionable novels, the
Waverley Novels, or the lomances of Mis  Rad
chffe     It was Hue that the newspapeis and pen
odicals might contain speculations of the editois
on political subjects, but so did the woiks of
Bolingbroke,andavaiietyofotherauthois   They
might also contain a icpul lication of the pio
ceedmgs of this bedy, and notices of subjects con
nected with the legislation of Coigress, but they
did not  necessarily contain them     They weie
unconnected with c-tery blanch of this Govern
ment    Honoiable gentlemen, ho thought, should
show some íeasonable connection between the
punting of documents and subscribing for news
papers     To admit the power was no aigument
in favoi of the utility or expediency of exercising I
it     We should never excicise power merelv to
show that we possess it    A few thoi sands could '
not be expended  moie  uselessly thin in tais i
way    Many floinishcs might be mide abou' the I
amount of useful information which the membei s '
would derive fiom the subsciiptions to news
papers, but was theie a single individual mem
ber, either of this or the othei  House, who «as [
qualified for a seat m Congress, who was not a I
subscriber to more papers than he had leisure to I
lead?    He ventuied to say theie was none, and
he defied contiadiction     The expendituie con
templated was therefoie useless, and not noces
sary     What must be  the leflection on seem"-
grave Senators seated at their desks looking over
the Mu roi, the Lady's Book,&c ,and afterwards
folding them up a id again tin owing them on Mr.

¡  bndoned v uh such things     4. mijonty of the
Senate, at the fast session, looked at the same
'  pnnciple imolvcd m anothei  subject, and cor-
ij rected it.    He (Mr   K ) opposed  the pnnciple
I then, but he  took no ciedit to himself for it,
11 because he usuaby acted with the paity who had
I  no power in this body, and theiefore he gave all
I   the credit of the measure he allu8ed   to  to the
Opposition     He concluded by moving that the
i íesolution be laid on the table
j      The motion was ciisigieed to, and the resolu-
tion was then adopted
