Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,

Fair Play, August 23, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

From a deserters who left Winchester last Saturday I gathered the following: His division (Kershaw's, Longstreet's old corps) left Richmond on the 7th, came by railroad to Charlottesville. He says it was reported that Field's division (same corps) left Richmond soon after, and was coming down east of the Blue Ridge. The following is the organization and strength of Kershaw's division as he gives it:

First Brigade (Humphreys'), four regiments, average, 200..... 800

Second Brigade (Bryan's), four regiments, average, 200....... 800

Third Brigade (Wofford's), five regiments and battalion......1,200

Fourth Brigade (Henagan's), three regiments, average,200=600;

two battalions, 300=600; 8th South Carolina, 800.............2,000

-----

Total division...............................................4,800

From previous information I estimate Early had before his

late re-enforcement of infantry.............................18,000

Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry 3,000; cavalry, 5,000................ 8,000

------

Total Early's present strength..............................30,800

An officer sent to Bloomery Gap reports no enemy west of North Mountain, with the exception of some 300 cavalry at Springfield, which I presume to be McNeill.

In addition to the above force, Early has about forty-two pieces of artillery. I have some scouts in rear of Early that I expect in to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
