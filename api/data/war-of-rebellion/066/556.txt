CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Colonel C. J. COLCOCK,

Pocotaligo, S. C.:

In highly appreciate your offer of troops to General Robertson or to send them to John's Island. Keep them in readiness; but I hope we shall not need them at this part of the line. They have fallen back from General Taliaferro's front on James Island. I think they were greatly disconcerted by their complete repulsed at Fort Johnson this morning. Keep your troops in readiness to move if needed.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 3, 1864.

Major General L. McLAWS,

Savannah, Ga.:

Has the First Georgia, Regulars yet started for General Robertson's district as ordered? Urge them forward. Assault of enemy on Fort Johnson at daylight handsomely repulsed. Still in position on James Island.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 4, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Army, near Marietta, Ga.:

Have you received my telegram of the 2nd instant asking for re-enforcements. The movements of the enemy in last three days place this city in great danger. I think 3,000 additional men would make it secure against the force now operating against it. Can you send them to me for temporary service?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 4, 1864.

Major General W. H. C. WHITING,

Wilmington, N. C.:

So far all the enemy's movements on the city have been repulsed with very slight loss to us and an estimated loss of more than 600 to the enemy. But their movements on James and John's Islands greatly endanger this city, and I shall be exceedingly glad to get the artillery battalion you mention. Send it without fail as soon as you can.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 4, 1864.

Major General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

A Yankee surgeon, captured near here yesterday, says a fleet of monitors had started to Mobile, from which much was expected. I give you the information for what it is worth.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
