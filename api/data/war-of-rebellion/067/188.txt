Numbers 3. Report of Major General George G. Meade, U. S. Army, commanding Army of the Potomac.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

November 1, 1864.

COLONEL: I habe the honor to submit, for the information of the lieutenant-general commanding, and at this his request, the subjoined outline of the movement of this army since the commencement of the campaign. The losses of commanders from the casualties of battle and expiration of service, the continuous operations that have been carried on almost without interruption, have precluded the possibility of any subordinate reports either being made out or transmitted to these headquarters. The following narration is therefore, made principally from memory and from such personal notes and documents as were at hand. It is necessarily brief and imperfect, and will undoubtedly in time be found to containerrors both of omission and commission. For these I must ask the indulgence of my brother officers and soldiers, with the assurance that when subordinate reports are received and time is given me it will be my duty, as well as my pleasure, to prepare a detailed report, which shall bear testimony to their gallantry and devotion to their country, so signally exhibited on this remarkable campaign, which I think I can, without exaggeration, pronounce as one unparalleled in military history for its duration, the character of the operations, and the number of battlesfought. Early in May the Army of the POtomac, under my immediate command, consisted of the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Corps of infantry, commanded, respectively, by Major-Generals Hancock, Warren, and Sedgwick; the Cavalry Corps under the command of Major-General Sheridan; a reserve park of artillery under the direction of Brigadier-General Hunt, chief of artillery, and under the immediate command of Colonel H. S. Burton, Fifth U. S. Artillery; an Engineer Brigade and pontoon train under Major Duane, Engineers; also a large park of supply wagons under the charge of Brigadier General Rufus Ingalls, chief quartermaster. The army
