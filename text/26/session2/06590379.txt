these commit'ees, lo inquire and repon the
facts to the House, in íelation to any suspicion he
may have' S r, have they done thi 1 Wul ihey
no* do it' No, no, no, suth a course does not
suit their purpose, as it makes an issue with them,
and pats the accused on his trial, v. hich if n jt a part
of the,r tactics in politics Their system is to con-
demn without a tnal, and sentence before a hear-
ing and by vague and <-l/ insinuation, to infuse
their poison in the public mind They shun all m-
ve tigation bv which truth is to be elicited, and
resort to mdi<cnmma!e charges, founded simply
upon their owi reckless as ertion Yea,
sir, and by such a course have tbev bpei but too
successful wuh the most innocent and credulous of
the country. But I say ipm, such a course can-
not "come to good ' Th re is a redeeming «p nt
in th people, in th.p D^mocrscy of tm« c untry,
that must and wid in t me overtake hem, or the
Government itself is undone. Wrat inai have
they attemp ed to proscribe in this tí), hat they
have noi already immor'aliz d the memory of,
wherever they have been brtught to i fa r in /est -
gation? Look at jour Secretary of the Treusu"y,
(L-vi Woodbury,) they have erected, sir, for him,
an immortality mor  duiaole than bra * Th y
had their committee—and such a one' He passed
its fiery ordeal, and what ha >• has been s orch< c?
Others, too, whom th°y dared not to put on trial,
whose conduct they shrank from all nteHigotion
of by committee, arp doomed to rise abov1 their
petty calumniators and ti-aducers in ímuortal gl ry
The American people only want time to reflect, to
be convinced of the chir-cter of the unholy war-
fare that has been waged against the Democracy,
for the profits of their labor—mechanical and pro-
ductive.
Mr Chairman, we are frequ itly tpunted with
our promises ot economy while opposing the ad-
ministration of the honorable gent tman who now
sits befcre me, [Mr ádíms ] Th  mtocent <-nd
uninformed hare been led to b°lis.e that th  enttie
opposition of tne R^pub1 ca>s u t-*e admms'ration
of Mi. Adaais was fojndcd on ita enornous ex-
penditures in the puDl c departure's Njt so, sir
There were higher principles at is=ue in tha* "it test
than in any expenditure of revenue. T e Demo
crats objected lo the manner in which th=f Admi-
nistration had come into power,as anti Repuohc n
The honorable gent'eman never did receive a ma-
jority of the votes oí the American people He
was not even toe hi2h°st candi- ¿te who reaped the
House of Representatives, but was 'aLen up, as it
was supposed, by an unholy al'iauc between h gh
contracting parties, tuou„h win a Uss, vote mm
General Jackson, and was foiced in on tie peop e
as a minority President—which aroused tbe De-
mocracy m every section of tne R^puDli" to re-
venge this wanton u«urpa'ion of p pular righ s.
The peop'e took tne subject in hand, ?nlat he
next election rebuked that Admin s-rati ", by , Us-
ing m power another, at the head of w ích they
placed the dis inguished individual who had ob-
tained th  greatest number of votes at the preced-
ing Presidential eiec'ion.
Mr. John Rando ph, of Vngmia, n exposirg

Mr Crawford most obstinately an I unreasonably, I confess re

as obstinately as Mr Ciawfoid refused to die, and so the gen

any man deny this who dare but remember, sir, he then ex
pecti-d to be a candidate before the House himself If you will
give us any other man Mr the gmtleman m question can
have no disposition to deny it It was at a time when he and

the Democratic party, that was the character of
extravaganee that was so signally rebuked by the
people in that great struggle. Yes, sir, an ex-
travaganee carryirg with it a sys em of corruption
and prodisahly, ihat well might cause the people
fear and ti embhng 11 wa-, to this kind of ex-
travagance and corruption to which the Democratic
party looked fo' reform and retrenchment, and
which, sir, they have ultima ely effected, trium-
phant'y effected, and by no "kumbvggery'" about
office holders, and high salaries, and 'kitchen fur-

Tae amount of the millions and hundred of mil-
lions of dollars that was sought to be expended
then by the Opposition party, who aie now to be
placed in powet for their notions of reform and
economv, ate justly illas rated b/ the following re
marks of a duungmshed Senator from South Caro-
lina, [the Hon William Smith,] who has since de-
parted this life, at his private residence, in the Stale
of Alabama, and, as a St mhern planter of wtrth

Sn it is not theieveuue you collect on foreign merchandise
