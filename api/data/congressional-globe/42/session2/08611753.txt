the works. Is that an example to commend
to the working people of the iron region of
either Indiana or Pennsylvania? No, sir; it is
not an example which American statesman-
ship should follow or propose.
Great Britain! The gentleman closed in a
blaze of glorification to Great Britain. He
tolil us that in 1842, under protection, pau-
perism had reached the enormous figure of
tour hundred and seven thousand. W hy, sir,
there are nearly half a million people fleeing
from the British islands annually to escape
the "blessings of free trade," and a large
share of them come to place themselves under
the oppressive "curse of protection" in the
United Slates; and under tree trade the num-
ber of paupers has swollen to more than twelve
hundred thousand, as asceriained by the num-
ber found in the unions on a holiday, the first,
day of the jear, which process showed as the
Govi rnmeiit has shown less than one third of
thin number in 1842, but, thirty years aao. Ti*it
is not the real number who reach pauperism
duiiiigthe year; for the census of the work-
house is taken oil the 1st of January, a holiday,
and the number of paupers found on that day
is what, is given to tlie world.
Mr. William Hoyle, a manufacturer of Man-
chester, observing that the annual report was
imperfect and delusive, went to his own, the
Bury union, and had a report made of the
number of paupers that had been in that union
during the year. The authorities had reported
but a little over four thousand. They had,
sir, reported but eleven vagrants. But what
was the result of Mr. Boyle's investigation?
During the year of which that report was
made there had been received as paupers in
that union more than fifteen thousand people,
and though its officers had reported but eleven
vagrants, there had been more than fifteen
thousand four hundred received.*
Free trade a blessing to the people of Eng-
land ! Why, all her philanthropists deplore
the fact that the small holding of land is dis-
appearing, that the small workshop which
might have grown to be a factory, is being
absorbed by the monopolizing capitalist. The
laborers flee from the blessings free trade con-
fers upon them in England, that they may not
go down in drunkenness and destitution to
unhonored graves, leaving no mourner to drop
a tear over their release from the miseries
inflicted upon them by the governing classes,
who look only to the interests of the consumer,
and take the very life blood from the operative
in every depar:merit of productive industry.
Let. us look at the fac's. Where does Eng-
land get. her door-frames, her doors, her win-
do w-Ira mes, and her window-sashes? Go look
at St. Thomas's Hospital, the last noble build-
ing erected by private munificence and Gov-
ernment aid in the city of Loudon, and inquire
where each door and door-frame, each window-
frame a'.d sash came from, and you will learn
that they came really made from Nurway.
On the 4<h of July la-.t my distinguished
friend from Massachusetts [Mr. Hoar] wrote
me from London. His letter was brief, and I
can recall most of it. Among other things he
said that having become somewhat familiarly
acquainted with an intelligent workingman, a
leader of his class, he had asked him how
the experiment of free-trade was working.
"Fatally for us," was the reply, as reported
by Mr. Hoar; "we begin to see how terrible
a mistake it was for the working classes.
Sir, in Pimlico alone I knew about eight
hundred men who made decent livings by cut-
ting lath ; but now ail our laths are imported
ready-cut from Norway, and most of those
men are either on the poor rates or are earn-
ing a precarious living by doing jobs. The
few who were able to have emigrated." He

able to append as notes a few passages which I
would have quoted, had the books from which they
are talren been at hand. The following is from a
thoughtful book by William Hoyle, of Manchester,

Resources, and How They Are Wasted:" "The
present population of the United Kingdom (1869) is
30,838.210; of these 1,281,651 are returned as paupers,
and 0.092 ;rs vagrants.

continued increase in our pauperism. It gives the

"The Government returns as to pauperism and
vagrancy do not, however, by any means represent
the extent of these two evils. They give the num-
ber of paupers on the books on the 1st day of Jan-
uary. and the number of vagrants wbo apply for
lodging or casual relief on the same day; but this,
but very imperfectly portrays the pauperism, &c.,
of the country. According to this method of reckon-
ing, if a man becomes chargeable to the union on
the 2d of January, and conies off again on the 31st
of December, he is not counted, though lie has been
receiving relief during the whole year, except two
days. The statistics of the poor law board give
the number of paupers and vagrantsrelieved on one
day, (which is what tlicy profess to do.) but it does
not give the number of persons who get rehet as
paupers and vagniuis during the year. This is the
idea ge nerally recer ed", but it is erroneous.
"In order to get the number of persons who re-
ceived relief during 1869, we must multiply 1.281,651
bv Si, which gives 4.4L5.778. This, then, is the :eal
number of persons who were chargeable as pau-
pers, at oue time or another, during that year,
or nearly one in seven of the entire population.
Admitting ttiat a considerable number of these
might be persons who applied twice or three tunes
over daring the year, it would still leave us about
one in every tec of the population as having been
paupers during the course of the year.
" The Government returns in reference to vagrancy
are even more imperfect and unsatisfactory than
the pauper returns. I have not been able to obtain
any national figures fo illustrate this, but it will
bo sufficiently manifest if X give tiio statistics m
reference to one union, the Bury union, in which I
reside.
" The following table gives the number of paupers
and vagrants returned to the poor law board, Jan-
uary 1,1870, and published in their report as repre-
senting the pauperism and vagrancy in the Bury
union, the population of which, m 1861, was 101,142:
Paupers ^,372
Vagrants,  11
"The actual number of cases of pauperism and
vagrancy during the year ending March, 1870, in the
Bury union was as follows:
Number of cases of paupers relieved  15,012
Number of cases of vagrants relieved  lo,474
"These returns corroborate the figures given by
Mr. Purdy in reference to the pauperism of the
country; and they show that if the total case? of
vagrancy during the year were given, it would,
numerically, be equal or greater than the number
ofpnupers.
"No doubt a very laree number of the vagrmt
cases are from among the pauper?, and in a large
proportion ot the cases the same- parties apply pev-
eral tiroes over in the sameunion. arid also at differ-
ent unions; still, it shows that there is a very large
class of our population who have no fixed dvvelling-
place: they move about getting a living by begging
or stealing or by imposition upon the public, as may
be most convenient. Adding this ela*s to tpe pau-
per class, it reveals an amount of destitution ana
demoralization in the counlry that is pcriectly ap-
palling, and that is a lasting disgrace to our civiliza-
tion and Christianity."
then pointed to St. Thomas's Hospital and
mentioned the facts to which I liave referred,
and added, " Sir, but for the fact that the
bricklayers' union would not permit men to
lay foreign bricks in London, the very bricks
of that building would have been brought, from
Belgium, where they bad been contracted for."
Has free trade blessed these working- people ?
But let us proceed. Where does Eng-
land go for her knit goodsâ€”she whom the
gentleman from Indiana savs free trade has
made foremost of nations and .the rni>tress of
the sea? Sir, England was foremost among the
nations and mistress of the seas a good while
before 1842, when the abstract theories of
speculative philosophers vanquished the expe-
rience of ages, and abandoning the protective
principle she adopted free trade. She has
more competition now among nations, and
more competition for supremacy upon the sea
than she has experienced at any lime since.
Sir George Downing gave old Noll Cromwell
the navigation laws, which piohibit-ed I he im-
portation into England or her colonies any
production of any portion of her widely ex-
tended empire in any other than an English
bottom. When that law went into efiVct the
cross of St. George supplanied the broom of
Van Trump, and Holland ceased 10 be the mis-
tress of the seas. From that time England
reigned mistress of the sea till during the
existence of our tariff of 1812, and for a few
years after its repeal we were competing with
her. And now France, protective France,
and Germany, protective Germany, are com-
peting with her, as we soon shall be if free
trade does not prevail and destroy our ship-
yards and our ability to produce at conven-
ient points American iron with which to build
ships.
But I have digressed. Let me answer my
question. She goes to Sweden for her knit
goods. That charlatan who aspires to the
title of friend of the working-people, Mr.
Mundella, the member of Parliament who
recently came over here to lecture us into
adopting free trade, is a leading manufacturer
of knit goods. Does he pay his constituents
even liberal English wages for producing his
goods? No, sir ; but while the English oper-
atives starve around him, he goes to Sweden,
where wages are lower, to get his work done.*
Hard as this is upon the oppressed aud suf-
fering laborers of Great Britain, it is very well
for us, and will continue to be so as long as we
shall defend and protect the higher wages of our
operatives by an adequate tariff. Such of the
working-people who are thus thrown out of em-
ployment as have not been reduced to a con-
dition of poverty that precludes the possibility
of their emigrating, come to our country to
earn good wages guarantied by a protective
tariff, and to enjoy home and family and a fiee
church as well as free schools for their chil-
dren.
*On page 33 of Sir Edward Sullivan's Protection
to Native Industiy, iho following remarks occur in
the text and a note: ...
"Those unacquainted with manufacturing indus-
tries can have no idea of the strength and number
of the temptations that already exist to induce the
English manufacturer to remove his capital and
enterprise to Prussia, Austria, France, or Belgium,
Some have already done so, and if the present con-
dition of affairs continues, many more will do so T
It will become a necessity of their existence. They
will then have two markets to manipulateâ€”the Eng-
lish, where tliey are admitted dniy tree, and their
own foreign market, where they are protected.
f " There is some little difficulty in reconciling
the conflicting statements of those manufacturers
who have started factories abroad; for instance,
Mr. Mundella. M. P. for Nottingham, has on two
separate occasions elicited cheers by most confiiciuig
statements. At the educational conference, he'd at
Manchester, January IS, 1865, he saul tbar his
firm emplojed seven hundred people in fcsaxony, and
that thev could all road and write. li.oud cheers.J
A few weeks ago he stated that only five per eont.
of his woik was done in (Saxony, uineiy-five per
cent, in England. [Loud cheers.] It becomes a
simple rule of three sum, if it takes seven hundred
people to do five per cent, of his work, how many
will it take todouinety-flvc per cent.? Answer, thir-
teen thousand three hundred."
