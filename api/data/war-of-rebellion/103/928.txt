Lieutenant A. J. ROCKWELL,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, First Brigade:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that in obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 20, headquarters First Brigade, Second Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, I moved from the camp of this brigade with the Twenty-third Iowa and Twentieth Wisconsin and a detachment of scouts, on the 13th instant, at 8 a. m., and arrived at Mr. Childers' farm, twelve miles distant, at 12 m. the same day, where I halted the infantry and sent the scouts forward to Bon Scours River. From Mr. Childers' farm I moved back down the bay to Shell Bank and camped during the night. Steamers even of light draft cannot be landed at Shell Bank or any place between there and Bon Scours River, without building a pier from 400 to 600 yards in length, and there is no material in the neighborhood to build a pier with. The country from here to Mr. Childers' farm is thickly interspersed with lagoons. There are no good roads-nothing but narrow and crooked paths. I met no enemy; neither could I obtain any reliable information concerning the enemy or his movements. I returned to camp on the evening of the 14th instant.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. L. GLASGOW,

Colonel, Commanding.
