1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3598
ever was a time in the history of this country
when civil law needed the aid of military power
to curb the lawless and to protect life and lib-
erty, it has been during the last few years in
those disturbed parts of the South where trea-
son abounded and has wreaked its vengeance
upon those who were faithful to the Union.
To no nobler use can the Army he dedicated
than in making war upon the men banded
together to break up the very foundations of
society, overthrow law, and bring on a state
of general anarchy and crime ; and I trust and
hope its mission will not cease until this Ku
Klux Klan is wholly suppressed and its mem-
bers brought to condign punishment.
Sir, briefly and imperfectly have I endeav-
ored to set forth the false excuses given for
these disorders and violences. Did these
excuses really have a foundation, it would not
the less be our duty to see that the supremacy
of the laws was maintained, and no man de-
prived' "of his rights except by due process
of law. I do not believe there is a civilized
Government on the earth where human rights
have been trampled under foot to such an
extent and with such impunity as in these
insurrectionary States during the last four
years. We shall be false to our duty and
recreant to the trust placed in our hands if we
do not listen to the cries of these oppressed
people and put a stop to this wholesale shed-
ding of blood and these other outrages which
shock humanity.
While, I speak the country is excited over
the punishment inflicted by a court-martial in
Cuba upon a man who claims with doubtful
title to be an American citizen. Democratic
orators denounce the Administration with
pusillanimity and cowardice for not stretching
forth the arm of the Government to release
Dr. Houard and extort from Spain the restor-
ation of his property. Yet these same gen-
tlemen are wholly insensible to the cries which
come up from the loyal people of the South.
American citizens at home may be murdered
by scores by the men lately in "rebellion
against the Government, and yet the sensi-
bilities of these gentlemen are not touched.
They are terribly exercised, however, lest
the Constitution may be wounded when we
propose efficient remedies. It is the same
old lament we heard all through the war,
when Congress enacted laws, and the Presi-
dent put them in force calculated to hurt
the enemy and directed against the same men
now engaged in this minor rebellion. There
was scarcely a law proposed for the vigorous
prosecution of the war which didnotencounter
the opposition of the Democratic party, and
which was not denounced as unconstitutional
by Democratic organs all over the country.
And it was so as to every law enacted to
secure the results of the war and give equal
rights to those who bad been in slavery.
It was so a year ago when the remedy given
by this bill and which has proved so potent
for good was proposed and enacted into a law.
And yet, despite the gloomy forebodings we
heard then, the public liberties have been
preserved, the country has enjoyed a high
degree of prosperity, and nobody has been
disturbed in tbe enjoyment of his lawful
rights. Nobody has been hurt by the denial
of this writ of habeas corpus except the crim-
inal men whom the courts have been able to
punish by reason of its suspension. Let these
gentlemen croak on; it is their occupation
and stock in trade. We shall never do vio-
lence to this sacred instrument while iu the
future, as in the past, we legislate to secure
to all and everywhere the' blessiugs of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have conversed with
Senators all around, and I will offer a propo-
sition which, if it meets with the unanimous
consent of the Senate, will carry out the con-
versation that occurred this morning.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Bore-
man in the chair.) The Secretary will report
the proposed agreement.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Ordered, That on Monday next at twelve o'clock,
Senate bill No. 656, to extend the provisions of sec-
tion four of the act of April 28, 1871, be resumed to
the exclusion of all other business, and that it be
continued, subject to recess and adjournment, until
disposed of before adjournment on Tuesday.
Mr. SHERMAN. I ask unanimous consent
to adopt that order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Ohio asks unanimous consent for the
adoption of the proposition that has just been
read. Is there any objection?
Mr. BLAIR. 1 think there will be no op-
position to that agreement on this side of the
Chamber. I rise simply'to get the floor on the
bill when it shall next come up.
Mr. SHERMAN. Let the order be adopted
and then I have no objection.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is whether it be an order of the Senate
or an agreement by unanimous consent.
Mr. SHERMAN. It had better be entered
on the Journal, and then there will be no dis-
pute about it.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be
no objection, this order will be made.
Mr. BLAIR. I desire now to take the floor
on the bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Missouri will be entitled to the floor.
Mr. BLAIR. I now give way to the Sen-
ator from Louisiana, Â£Mr. West.]
Mr. SHERMAN. In pursuance of the same
understanding, I move that the pending bill
be postponed until Monday next at twelve
o'clock, under that order.
The motion was agreed to.

Mr. COLE. I should like to dispose of the
conference report, which is now lying on the
table. I think there is no objection to it atall.
Mr. SUMNER. What do I understand to be
the question ?
Mr. COLE. I ask to have a vote taken on
the report of the conference committee on the
Indian appropriation bill.
Mr. SUMNER. Will that take time?
Mr. COLE. No, sir; I am sure it will not
take any time.
