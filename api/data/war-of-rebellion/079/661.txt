on Macon you may take it for granted I have shot off toward Opelika, Montgomery, and Mobile Bay or Pensacola. I will not attempt to send couriers back, but trust to the Richmond papers to keep you well advised. I will give you notice by telegraph of the exact time of my departure. General Steedman is here to clear the railroad back to Chattanooga, and I will see that the road is broken completely between the Etowah and the Chattahoochee, including their bridges, and that Atlanta itself is utterly destroyed.

I am, with respect,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

[NOVEMBER 6, 1864. -For Sherman to Sheridan, relating to operations in the Shenandoah Valley, &amp;c., see Vol. XLIII.]
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 6, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICERS OF ALL POSTS AND STATIONS:

Beauregard, with Hood's army, is at Florence and Tuscumbia, a country already devastated and stripped of provisions. Forrest is opposite Johnsonville, on the Tennessee River, and has done considerable damage to gun-boats and transports, but has captured no provisions, and as that is but one of three of our lines of supply the temporary interruption will not be felt. I want the preparations heretofore ordered for this army to go on with as much speed as possible, but the probabilities are that time will be allowed in our present camps for the complete payments of all our troops, the sending back of the soldiers' money, and the Presidential election of Tuesday next. Attention also must be paid to getting the conscripts to their proper companies and have them properly armed and clothed.

Major-General.

Atlanta, Ga.:

General Ruger has the offer of a DIVISION in the Twenty-THIRD Corps. Unless you can do as well by him, direct him to come to me, and I will make the order of transfer of himself and personal staff to the Army of the Ohio.

Major-General.
