To the ííovu of Representthves of the Un ted States
In partial compliance \ uii the resolution of the
Hou'e of Represent mves of the 21st ult calling
for Anther information on the relations between the
United States and the Mexican Republic, I ti, ns-
mit a repoit from the Secretary of State, to whom
the resolution was referred
(Signed)              M VAN BUREN
Washington, 26(/* April, 1838
[The message was accompanied by a report from
the Secictary of State, and a miss of conespond-
ence The leport set forth the leasons why the
whole had not been sent in, substan ¡ally that all
that was must material was furnished, that th 
whole was very voluminous, and nad oeen rtcened
at so (ate a period that there has boen insufficient
time for translation, áx ]
On motion of Mr HOWARD, the whole was
referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
ThTSPEAIÍÉR, on leave, laid befoie the House
two Executive communications, viz
1   From the Postmaster General, in rehtion  to
an unsettled balance, due from —---------Crocl ett,
Postmaster at Frankfort, Ky andFiancisP Blair,
as security
On motion of Mr BRIGGS, laid on the table

ings, containing copies of all contracts made in his

plicants foi saideontracts, and the amount of their
respective bids.
On motion of Mr WHITTLESEY, of Ohio,
referred to the Committee on Public Buildings
Mr SLRG^ANT, on leave, presented some re-
solutions ol the councils of the city of Philadelphia,
in lavor<f the construction of a dry dock at that
place, which were referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs
THE LATE DUEL.
The House resumed the consideration of the re-
port of the committee appointed to investigate the
causes which led to the death of the late Mr Cil-
u,y The question was on the unanimous motion
of the committee (mrough Mr Touciy, the chair-
man) to print and postpone it till Monday week.
The .eadmg of the testimony was resumed, and
was concluded at one o'clock
Mr WISE then called for the reading o*1 the
journal oft! e commit'ee, siying that he considered
it all-impor.ant to a correct understanding of the
case
The reading was accordingly  ordered, and the
c!erk proceeded to read the journal
which, having been completed,
Mr TOUCEY sai , the House had imposed
upon the committee a most de icate and responsible
duty Tne committee had performed it to the best
of then ability, and with fidelity They had not
been careful to inquire who would stand by them
in the House, but they had performed their duty
wi h care and impartiality If it was the pleasure
ot the House to retrace their steps—to go over
Jgiin the mass of evidence and memorials pre-
senlrd to the comm tee, it was no pirt of their duty
to tomplnn The-e a-e now objections made to
the publication of the leport and evidence, and if
the object on had any foundation at a-il ifit was cor-
rect! taken by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
RoBimrsoN,] and by the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, [Mr Arums,] if it was correctly taken at all,
it goes to annihilate the powers of the committee,
and a'l that tnpy have done would be coriectly
suppressed. That view had not been unobserved,
it hid been repeatedly pressed during the dtscus-
sio' , and the veiy gentlemen ,t ho took that ground
had abandoned it, and now acknowledge that it has
no appltc tit n at all tothepresei case I am not
a ioul to contend th?t if \ standing committee-—the
Committee on Indian Affairs, ior instance—should
be instructed to inquire into a general matter, and
should inid a member imolved m a question
oí pnvii<"*e, tint they couid go irlo 'hat m-
quuy at all They mu«t report to the House,
mentioning the member invohed in t.n question
ot privilege, and then the Eíouse could give that
committee, or some other commit'ee authontv to
inquire The rule, he said, was a sound and salu-
tary rule for the government of such committees,
but it ought not to be perverted to a case to which
it has no application at all If the rule has appli-
es! ion to tin , committee, there 'S no hilt-nay
ground, you must tin on therepoitundei the tab'c
Yen should n t let in one poition—if the lule
applies—either ot the  eport, or evidence, oi jour-
nal, b"cause the committee had no power at all
Ar I though the committee has cause to complain
ot the remarks of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mr "\dams] that the committee had com-
m tted a gieatei breach of privilege than had been
committed by those whose hands were ímbtued m
blood, he hoped they would be excused in doing
so, because they had followed the precedent set by
him [Mr A ] m his better days, while he was a
membet of the other branch of Congress
Mt T read the mle, and then sa d the question
of privilege was one to be decided by the whole
House It is the privilege of the whole House,
and is not the peculiar privilege of a member ex-
cept as he stands in i elation to the whole House
Every membei may insist, and must ms st, if upon
atrial for a question of privilege by the whole
House, and a committee is ordered upon a general
inquiry, they cannot touch such a question, because
thequestion of privilege has not been leferred to
them    They cannot go into an examination sc
