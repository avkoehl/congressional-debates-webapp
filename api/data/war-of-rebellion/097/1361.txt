ground will permit. If they are completed as originally intended they will make that part of our line secure. After finishing these dams they should be thickly covered with the abatis that is now uselessly lying in front of the water. I think this work of more immediate importance then the work on the batteries, and unless you can supply tools to employ all the men that can work at this it would be better to put your negro labor there and finish them at once. If you have the tools General Hunton will be able to furnish the labor to finish the dams.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant General.

The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to inform you and, through you, your troops that his intention is to recommend for the position of officers in the regiments of negroes to be raised such non-commissioned officers and privates as by their personal exertions defeat any attempt of desertion to the enemy and secure the person making the attempt.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
