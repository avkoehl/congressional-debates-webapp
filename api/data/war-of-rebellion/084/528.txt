Aide-de-Camp:

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Paola, August 2, 1864.

Colonel C. R. JENNINSON,

15th Kans. Cav., Commanding Sub-Dist. Numbers 1, Mound City, Kans.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose herewith copy of orders for relieving certain officers of the Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, on duty in your sub-district, and of the Fifteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, on duty in Colonel Moonlight's command. The general thinks it would not do very well to have Colonel Hoyt relieved until Colonel Plumb arrives. He also desires you to have Lieutenant Walker, Company C, Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, acting assistant quartermaster and commissary of subsistence, at Humboldt, relieved as soon as Lieutenant Nichols reports to you, as it is necessary to have an acting assistant quartermaster at Olathe. It is understood that Lieutenant Walker had considerable property on hand.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
