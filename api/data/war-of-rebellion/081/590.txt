July 2, 1864-1.40 a.m.

The corps will move at 5 this a.m. in the following order: First, First Division; second, artillery and trains; third, Third Division; fourth, Second Division; and resume its former position on the left of the Second Corps, extending across the plank road. General Gibbon will be moved to the left of the Second Corps. The left of our picket-line will be near Sturdivant's Mill, as before. The pickets here will be withdrawn, one hour after the rear of the column has left, under the direction of Colonel Emerson, One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, corps officer of the day, and will be returned to their regiments upon arriving at the old position.

By command of Major-General Wright:

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 2, 1864-10.15 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

No changes have taken place in the position of our lines since yesterday morning. We are, however, strengthening them all the time and are just completing the epaulements for heavy guns. Six 4 1/2-inch guns will be placed in position to-night opposite the left of our line just in front of our signal station, and it is possible six more will be sent us to-day or to-morrow, as well as four 8 or 10 inch mortars. The mining is progressing very fairly. The gallery is now 250 feet in length. We experienced some difficulty yesterday from running into quicksand; the props gave way and a considerable portion of the top fell in. A more complicated system of propping will have to be resorted to, but we hope to overcome the difficulty to-day. The firing last night was either a feeble attack or a stampede on the part of the enemy. Our people fired but very little and our loss was very trifling.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 2, 1864-10.30 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that no changes or movements of importance have taken place in my front to-day. The picket-firing has been less than usual. Our works and mining operations are progressing favorably.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
