HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,May 29, 1864 - 3 p. m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: The enemy is reported on my right in force, a heavy line of skirmishers and a line of battle. His line is on the side of the stream opposite you. I am across and the head of my column about 1 mile of Old Church. A negro reports that all the darkest say the enemy's force is a at Shady Grove.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The enemy's cavalry in my front, but no large force so far.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Norman's House, May 29, 1864 - 3.30 p. m.

General GRIFFIN:

I have just received your note saying the head of your column at 3 p. m. was within 1 mile of Old Church. If you have not mistaken the name you have the road. You were to go toward Shady Grove, which lies southwest from here, while Old Church is southeast. If you can consult Captain Plaine and Captain Mackenzie they will probably tell you whether you are on the right road or not.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 29, 1864 - 3.55 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

General Griffin is in my front on the Mill Creek road. His skirmishers are now engaged with the enemy. I am on the Totopotomoy, my left resting there, my right connecting with General Cutler. I have pickets on the Smith's Mill road, which runs along my front, and connects with Second Corps. General Griffin has asked me for a regiment on each flank, as he is about to advance.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
