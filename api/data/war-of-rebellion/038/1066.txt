year, we should do more to retrieve our affairs than by anything else which it is possible for us to achieve. If the cthe enemy seem now to feel in subjugating us could be once more disturbed or broken down, it would be difficult for them to recover it again. If we could reconquer Tennessee, that confidence would be destroyed.

But it is needless for me to suggest plans of campaign to you. I will only add that we all trust you, and look to you for deliverance in the southwest.

Very truly and respectfully, your friend,

R. M. T. HUNTER.

DALTON, January, 31, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I have had the honor to receive the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury to the President, dated January 9, with your indorsement dated 11th.

During the siege of Vicksburg, Governor Pettus proposed to me the adoption of a plan suggested by Judge Tucker, to be executed under that gentleman's direction, to cut off supplies from the besieging army. He required $20,000 to inaugurate it. I drew a check for that sum on the assistant treasurer in Mobile, in favor of Governor Pettus, who indorsed it to Judge Tucker. After considerable delay caused by reference of the matter to the Treasury Department, the money was paid. While I remained in Mississippi, Judge Tucker was, I believe, using this money against the enemy's navigation of the river. About the end of October, I wrote an explanation of the case to the Secretary of the Navy, to be delivered by Judge Tucker, who had large claims against that Department for enemy's property destroyed on the water.

This sum was not a part of that transferred to me by Commander [Samuel] Barron, all of which was returned by me to the Navy Department.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston.
