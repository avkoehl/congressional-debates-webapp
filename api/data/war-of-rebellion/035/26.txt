MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANGER:

Have telegraphed to have two brigades sent to Clarksville. It is highly desirable cavalry and spare animals should go the same route, two brigades of infantry and two batteries to stop at Clarksville; balance to go to Nashville.

Brigadier-General JOHNSON,

Commanding Right Wing:

Send Brigadier-General Davis at daylight in the morning with his division on the Versailles pike to the forks of the road leading to Eagleville. They should take five days' rations, their spades, and axes. On arriving at this point, select a good position for security against attack and surprise. Send one brigade of infantry and one of cavalry to surprise Unionville and Rover, and capture everything on the road; another brigade of infantry and one of cavalry to Eagleville, to capture any force there. The Rover expedition should return to his [Davis'] camp. The brigade at Eagleville, after whipping out everything it can find, should take post on the road leading to the camp, if practicable, but near enough to command the Nolensville and Eagleville pike, and prevent anything from passing. Part of the brigade of cavalry that returns to camp must watch the road south and east, and keep open communication to the rear; the remaining can join the brigade at Eagleville. This division thus posted will act as a corps of observation, watching toward Shelbyville, and at the same time the movements of the rebel cavalry, which latter it will cut to pieces the moment an opportunity offers. Of course, General Davis will have discretion to act in this case, keeping us advised of everything. I think it would be prudent to protect his rear and keep open communication with him by directing General Sheridan to post a brigade at Salem to watch the Middleton road and keep all spying at a distance by sharp daily patrols. You will instruct General Davis accordingly.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier-General STANLEY,

Commanding Cavalry:

The general directs that you send two brigades of cavalry, to be reported to General Davis, who will start early to-morrow morning toward Salem and Versailles. The object of the movement is to intercept any detachments of cavalry that may be found on the Nolensville or Shelbyville pikes, and also to capture any of the enemy's forces that may be found in the vicinity of Eagleville or Rover. Your brigades will be reported to General Davis by daylight to-morrow (Saturday) morning, and with three days' rations with them, or five days' would be better.

Very respectfully,

FRANK S. BOND,

Aide-de-Camp.
