Brigadier-General GILLEM

Bulls' Gap:

I am advised by the commissioners who met the rebels at Greenville that according to their arrangement to more citizens should be arrested in East Tennessee by either side for mere political offenses before their next meeting, on the 1st of October. As I am most anxious to secure the release of Union citizens, will you please direct you command to abstain from any further arrests that would be in violation of above agreement.
