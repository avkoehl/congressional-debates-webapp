Your letter of the 27th just received. I have no objection to the publication referred to, if you think it advisable.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,February 1, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

SIR: I beg leave to inclose you the within copy of orders issued by Colonel W. L. Jackson, and forwarded by the chief to the collector for the Eleventh Cngressional District. He is now foraging upon one of the resources of supply for this army. I would suggest that he be ordered farther west and away from the railroads. His command ought to be able to obtain forage in the counties farther west, otherwise inaccessible to the troops. We find it very difficult to keep the army even partially supplied, and it is a matter of great importance that all the commands which can possibly do so, should forage in the more remote and inaccessible districts.*

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

[First indorsement.]

FEBRUARY 4, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Forward to Colonel Jackson a copy of General Lee's letter, and instruct him as the Department recognizes the reasonableness of General Lee's suggestions to conform to them.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.
