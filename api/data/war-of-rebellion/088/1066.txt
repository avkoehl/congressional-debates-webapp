cents for lead. Informant states that the quartermaster told him he had not enough money to pay them,and went to borrow some, saying that they must have their money, as they would soon be sent to re-enforce Early. Some of informants think that Hoke's division has gone, but on says he saw the division yesterday,and it would relieve Johnson to-day at 9 a.m. A Mississippi brigade, which informant does not know, went to Early about five days ago; it had been lying in Petersburg.

NOTE.- This must be Humphreys' brigade, of Kershaw's division, which was reported to have been left behind.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from the Twelfth Virginia, Weisiger's brigade, Mahone's division, came into our lines this a.m. in front of the Ninth Army Corps. He states that he has every reason to believe that two divisions have been sent to Early-Field's, of Longstreet's corps, and Hoke's division, of Beauregard's command-basing his belief on what he has heard by conversation in his brigade.

NOTE.- From the fact that Hoke's division was to have relieved Johnson's yesterday at 5 o'clock and did not, it seems probable it may have gone to Early. Field's division has been lying in reserve on the right-enemy's right.
