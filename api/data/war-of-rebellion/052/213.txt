Pontoon bridge across at Caperton's Ferry. Two brigades over. Cavalry forded at two places. Brannan's advance crossed at Battle Creek. Reynold's advance at Shellmound. Reports not in yet, but suppose we have 100 prisoners. No fighting to amount to anything.

General J. G. TOTTEN,

Chief Engineer, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

Can two regiments of volunteer engineers be raised under the veteran volunteer acts from the Pioneer Brigade? The officers and men were carefully selected, but the lack of rank of the officers is injurious to discipline, and, their loss of promotion from being detached from their regiments is an injustice to them. Two fine regiments could be raised.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, August 29, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch of this date having been referred to the Secretary of War, he directs me to say enlistments authorized by yourself and Governor Johnson will be approved by the Department, care being taken in the selection and organization to distribut them so as to be under the control of Union forces and sentiment. To this extent the rules of the Department are temporarily modified in your department.

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.
