HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,February 21, 1865.

General B. BRAGG;

I suggest you inform General Schofield that the arrangement for reception of prisoners at Wilmington was made by General Grant, and that his refusal will subject them to great suffering, as they will have to be marched through the country ill-provided.

R. E. LEE.

RALEIGH, February 21, 1865.

General S. COOPER:

The Federal authorities in Wilmington refuse to receive the prisoners. What shall I do with those here?

T. H. HOLMES,

Lieutenant-General.

RALEIGH, February 21, 1865.

General COOPER:

Federal prisoners (officers) have been returned to Danville. Federal authorities refuse to receive them at Wilmington. Say they must be delivered at Richmond.

T. H. HOLMES.

SALISBURY, N. C., February 21, 1865.

Brigadier General W. M. GARDNER, Richmond:

Major-General Hoke telegraphs me from Wilmington February 20 that Federal authorities refuse to receive prisoners. I am still sending them on as fast as possible. I shall probably have to march them to Greensborough.

BRADLEY T. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.

GREENSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

Brigadier-General JOHNSON:

All prisoners have gone. Trains will all be sent to Goldsborough for troops. Prisoners can be put on them as they return, and it will then be unnecessary to transship here.

MASON MORFIT,

Major.

GREENSBOROUGH, February 21, 1865.

General JOHNSON:

I have received orders from General Holmes to send no more prisoners to Wilmington. Federal authorities refuse to receive them.
