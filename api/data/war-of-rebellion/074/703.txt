The fate of Atlanta was sealed from the moment when General Hood allowed an enemy superior in numbers to pass unmolested around his flank and plant himself firmly upon his only line of railroad. if, after the enemy reached Jonesborough, General Hood had attacked him with his whole army instead of with a part of it, he could not reasonably have expected to drive from that position an army before which his own had been for four months retiring in the open field.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

ADDENDA.

SEPTEMBER 11, 1864.

Colonel ROY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I wish you would furnish me the loss of Hardee's corps on 27th of June on the Kenesaw line; also at same time General Hardee's estimate of the loss of the enemy on that day. I infer from what you told me that you had facts already in your possession. I wish it for a particular purpose. Send to me, care of Colonel Harvie. It will be several days yet before we get through with the witnesses in the court of inquiry.

Very truly, and in haste,

W. D. PICKETT.

[Indorsement.]

COLONEL: I think our loss was 100 and some few odd. It was almost nothing. Estimates of enemy's loss in front of Cheatham and Cleburne's left varied from 2,000 to 5,000. Captain Buel (captured the other day) says 2,000.

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
