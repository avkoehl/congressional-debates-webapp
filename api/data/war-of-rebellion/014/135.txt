lines their works prove to have been most formidable, and I am now fully satisfied of the correctness of the course I have pursued. The success is brilliant, and you may rest assured that its effects will be of the greatest importance. There shall be no delay in following up the rebels. The rebels have been guilty of the most murderous and barbarous conduct in placing torpedoes within the abandoned works near wells and springs; near flag-staffs, magazines, telegraph offices, in carpet-bags, barrels of flour,&amp;c. Fortunately we have not lost many men in this manner - some 4 or 5 killed and perhaps a dozen wounded. I shall make the prisoners remove them at their own peril.

General E. V. SUMNER:

The enemy has abandoned Yorktown, leaving all their heavy guns, ammunition,tents,&c.

General Stoneman is just starting out on the Yorktown road toward Williamsburg, with all our cavalry, four batteries of light artillery, and will shortly be followed by a division of infantry. He is to push on to will shortly be followed by a division of infantry. He is to push on to Williamsburg, and you command, which goes on toward Williamsburg, will probably meet this command near the Half-way House.

You will please hold the remainder of your command in readiness to march at short notice. It is not supposed that there are more than a few regiments this side of Williamsburg.

General FITZ JOHN PORTER,Commanding Division:

Stoneman found five or six regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and a battery in intrenchments near Williamsburg. Several cavalry charges, in all of which we gained the advantage; could do nothing against intrenchments. Four divisions of infantry now there, and the works no doubt carried and hour or so ago. Will inform you when I hear further. You will probably move by water.
