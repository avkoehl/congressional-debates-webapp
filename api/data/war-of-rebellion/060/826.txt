WASHINGTON, D. C., April 8, 1864-3 p. m.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Columbus, Ohio:

Lieutenant-General Grant directs that you cause a through examination to be made in your department so as to get every available man into the field as early as possible. All delays, irregularities, and neglects to forward the men should be reported to the Adjutant-General of the Army that the necessary orders may be issued. All recruits and new organization and all the old troops that can possibly be spared from Ohio and Michigan are to rendezvous at Washington, and all in Indiana and Illinois at Louisville. This order does not apply to veterans, who will return to the commands to which they belong, unless, otherwise specially ordered, nor does it apply to recruits for particular corps. The lieutenant-general wishes the old troops in your department reduced to the lowest number of men necessary for the duty to be performed.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF DELAWARE,Wilmington, April 8, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel S. B. LAWRENCE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Middle Dept., Eighth Corps, Baltimore:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that in obedience to your telegram of the 4th instant, received at 10 p. m. same day, I proceeded to Salisbury, Eastern Shore of Maryland, on the morning of the 5th instant, by special train, taking with me Captain Solomon Townsend's company (D of the First Delaware Cavalry), numbering 3 commissioned officers and 60 enlisted men. Looking to the very probable want of a few mounted men to act as couriers and to send to distant election precincts, I took with me Orderly Sergt. Joseph J. Janney and 20 men of Company C, Purnell Maryland
