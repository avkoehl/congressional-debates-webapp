WARRENSBURG, September 1, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Ford has scouted the country in the vicinity of Morristown, on Grand River, and Black Crossing of the Sni, and reports no large bodies of guerrillas concentrating at those points.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

GLASGOW, September 1, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have just arrived. A large rebel force under Todd, about 200, was concentrating yesterday noon between Dover and Waverly, while another force of forty men was coming from Arrow Rock toward Salt Pond, in Saline. I think they intend a raid on the loyal settlement in Southeast La Fayette. I have been on a scout in that direction myself, returning last night to Waverly. Learning these facts from rebel sympathizers, I ordered one of them to take this information to the vicinity concerned. I leave here immediately to meet the steamer Tutt, which is to relieve the Fanny Ogden on her way up.

Major and Chief of Cavalry, Commanding Gun-boat Ogden.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,September 1, 1864.

COMMANDER OF STEAM-BOAT FANNY OGDEN,

Boonville, Mo.:

Send out the cavalry under your command and some of the infantry secretly against the rebels to co-operate with a force from the railroad.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 1, 1864.

Major HENRY SUESS,

Commanding Fanny Ogden, Glasgow:

I wish, if possible, that your forces should be used, except a steamboat guard of twenty-five men, in an expedition from Boonville to cooperate with troops from Mexico, which move to-morrow on the rebels in Boone and Howard. I want the movement so planned that it will surprise the bushwhackers on a side they least expect. Have you the right kind of officers, men, and information to undertake this, and what do you propose? Answer.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 1, 1864.

Captain J. P. DROUILLARD,

Aide-de-Camp:

The steamer Buffington has been in the hands of the rebels, but is now at this port. One man was killed on her on Tuesday last. She came back yesterday.

J. S. WOLFE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
