the Mississippi at the point at which the enemy's boats are found and in the rivers above. Beyond all he must be a man of coolness, nerve, and judgment, and one whose whole heart is in our cause. Such a man is Colonel Richmond, who has been a member of my staff for many months-a man I know well-and who, in my opinion, is better adapted to that service than any man I know in or out of the Naval service. Colonel Richmond has served for eight years in the Navy. I believe his appointment to that command of great importance to our cause, and I shall be glad to see it made.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-As to the battle of the 6th and 7th, I refer you to Colonel Richmond. I have nominated two of my colonels for promotion-Colonel Preston Smith and Colonel George Maney. Both distinguished themselves, and both are highly competent for brigade commanders. I need them both badly.
