BOONSBOROUGH.

Sunday evening, September 14, about 4 o'clock, after most fatiguing march, under which some of our men broke down, the brigade took position on the slope of a mountain on the east side of the turnpike. Soon after we had halted, the enemy advanced upon us in overwhelming numbers. After fighting for about an hour, and after the other regiments of the brigade had broken and retired, and we were about being flanked by the enemy, I ordered my regiment to retire, firing. After we began the retreat, we were so unfortunate as to lose our gallant lieutenant-colonel (R. S. Menas), who was shot through the thigh. I detailed four men to bear him off, but the magnanimously refused to allow them to make the effort, as the enemy was in a short distance of him and still advancing.

I succeeded in forming a new line of battle, on a knoll about 300 yards in rear of the first line, but was soon flanked by the enemy and compelled to retire. I brought off with me 36 men, rank and file, in order. I was soon ordered by Major Sorrel to form on the left of General Jenkins' brigade; but before we were able to do so night overtook us, and, under the order of General Evans, we retired to the turnpike.

In this battle we had engaged-

SHARPSBURG.

Tuesday, September 16, we were subjected to a severe shelling at Sharpsburg, and lost 1 man killed and 6 wounded.

In the afternoon, by order of Colonel Stevens, I took my regiment and the Holcombe Legion, in all about 100 men, and moved forward about half a mile to sport the skirmishers of Jenkins' brigade and of a Georgia regiment.

About 1 o'clock Wednesday, September 17, the skirmishers were driven in, and, with the assistance of Captain [H. D. D.] Twiggs (a most noble and gallant officers), of the First Georgia Regiment, I suc-
