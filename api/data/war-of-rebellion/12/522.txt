
batteries. His possession of these communications would have compelled the abandonment of the woods, endangered the reserves of artillery and the trains. A large body of cavalry was held in hand to dash along the avenues in case of the success of the attack.

Not far from 3.30 p.m. General Heintzelman sent word by Captain Morris that he was in command on my left; that I must hold on to the woods at all hazards, and he would send support. The message was cheering, but the aid failed to reach me, having probably been called for at some other point.

My thanks are especially due General Sumner, Keyes, and Couch for the lively interest manifested by them, as shown by the liberal supports which they dispatched so soon as at command. The latter, in spite of severe illness, communicated with me many times, and came after, midnight in the woods, through all possible discomforts, to see if anything was desired. Captains Parker and Walker, Lieutenants Edwards and Burt, of his staff, all conveyed orders of importance, for which I am under obligation.

General Devens came on the field and reported with Colonel Russell's Massachusetts regiment, where the enemy's batteries were in full play, and requested that I would give him a position on the advance. General Keim soon followed with Colonel Howell's regiment. Both generals were zealous and judicious. Colonels De Trobriand, Riker, Rowley, Ballier, and Johnston commanded regiments with coolness and discretion. The latter had his horse shot under him. Colonel McCarter went into action with his regiment and did good service, although very much indisposed. Colonels Russell's and Howell's regiments quickly gained places at the weakest points of the line, and deserve especial mention for their services. Colonel Wheaton, J. H. Wilson, Anderson, and Butler, and Major Gazzam, of the One hundred and third Pennsylvania Volunteers, were very efficient, and only needed a renewal of the action to exhibit their soldiership.

Many charges upon advanced parties of the enemy, repeated sharp contests for the battery, well-directed fires upon cavalry, exhibitions of tactical knowledge and address in holding men like a rock under heavy cross-fires, were reported by commanders or under my own observation. So much of patient endurance and soldierly bearing was displayed that it is impossible to discriminate. With the exception of a small number of the Ninety-eight Pennsylvania and Fifty-fifth New York the conduct of all officers and men in this command was highly gratifying. Brigade Surg. S. R. Haven, Captain William H. Morris, assistant adjutant-general, aides Lieuts. S. Titus [quite sick], Charles R. Sterling, and Daniel Lodor, jr., were all actively employed on the field, and discharged their duties to my entire satisfaction. Brigade Quartermaster John S. Schultze and Commissary Captain M. J. Green were diligent in their departments.

It is proper to observe that while I was engaged with one portion of my brigade on General Hooker's right, the other was detained on the road by superior authority, for the passage of General Kearny's artillery to his left, so that I was directly and indirectly aiding both flanks during that detention. The regiments arrived just in time to save my position.

The accompanying* list includes the names of many of the best men in the command, whose loss is deeply regretted. They poured out their blood in defense of constitutional liberty, and their memories will be
