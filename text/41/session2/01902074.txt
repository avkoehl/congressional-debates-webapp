THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 18,
a rare combination of material and skill for
tanning.
We have also a grand and growing industry
m the leather business. Give us the raw ma-
terial free and let us produce the manufactured
article for ourselves and for export. Do you
not know that the present policy is driving
capital out of the country; driving it into Can-
ada, to engage in the leather business there?
We want the rough forms of lumber free, so
that the homes of the people maybe cheaper,
so that it shall no longer cost a small fortune
to build a cottage to shelter a family, so that
our own forests shall not be stripped from the
face of the earth by the greed of our people.
We want printing paper free. It is the
material for the dissemination of intelligence.
Let it come in free, and let our book-makers
and publishers have the benefit of the cheap
material.
I might mention other items, but those I have
named will show the general drift of my views
upon the question, to remove or reduce the
duty on articles of necessity and raw materials.
These things which I have mentioned should
come free, except pig-iron and sugar, and on
them there should be material reductions. The
people demand such a policy as this. I am
bold to say in this presence to gentlemen who
have been discussing and will continue to
discuss the abstract question of free trade or
protection, that the people care less about that
subject than gentlemen may imagine. They
have heard it discussed for three generations ;
and I ask gentlemen, however learned and able
they may be, if they really expect to settle a
question which Hamilton and Clay could not
settle? 1 appeal to my young and enthusiastic
friends who have espoused the cause of free
trade to abate something of their enthusiasm for
the beautiful ideas which can never be wholly
realized until the commercial millennium ; and
1 ask my friends who have grown almost fanat-
ical on the subject of protection to defer the
advocacy of their theory until we can some-
what relieve thepeople of their burdens. A pro-
longed and determined struggle by the oppo-
site side on this question will defeat any bill,
however cunningly it may be devised or how
liberally framed ; and we shall go before the
people next autumn without having done any-
thing to relieve them from the burden of the
tariff.
In order, if possible, to commend what I have
said to the good opinion of the old members
of this House who have espoused the side of
protection, I wish to remind them that the pro
tectionists of this day are going farm advance
ofand departingfrom the doclrmesof the found-
ers of the American policy. In Mr. Greeley's
book on political economy, on page 31, you
will find this language:
" Whoovor will consult Alexander Hamilton's rt>-
porton manufactures, thewritiusraof Matttioiv (Jurey,
lIcKekiah Kites. arid then- compeer*,with tbpspecehi-^
ol'llenry Clay, Thomas Newton, James Tod, Walter
Foi ward, Rollin 0. Mallory, and other forensic elia 111-
pions of protection, with the messages of our earlier
i're.-iden fH, of Governors Simon Snyder, Ueorge Clin-
ton, Daniel i). Tompkins, Do Witt Clinton, Ac..,
cannot, fail to note that they cli.iinpioncd, not tlio
maintenance, but t,ho creation of homo manufac-
tures—not mainly the preservation of existing inter-
ests and industries, but the naturalizing or calling
into life of pursuits new to our countrymen; and
this not for the sake, primarily, of thoso who should
thus bo incited to manufacture, or drawn hither from
Europe to plant their arts on our soil, but foi the
benefit, directly and mainly, ofthose who thonwere,
and would probably remain, farmers."
So the old protectionists were patriots, and
they were protectionists because they were
patriots. They were national men, not State
men ; they were Union men, not sectional men.
J love to hear the echoes of the silvery, mag-
netic voice of Harry Clay. It was my fortune
to be partly raised within twelve miles of Ash-
land; and often have 1 heard, and as a boy
almost worshiped him. But we should not for-
get that echo in repeating music sometimes
makesstrangediscord. Anditsounds strangely
discordant in this generation, after Clay has
gone t6 his rest, to hear his political descend-
ants, men claiming to wear his robes, advo-
cating perpetual protection for established
interests. Surely York can afford to abate
something. If the salt interest suffers let the
State of New York, which receives over eighty
thousand dollars a year from salt, pay over
that amount to aid them. If protection be
such a blessing to New York why does she
not herself protect her local interests? Pro-
tection, like charity, should begin at home.
If it bo good for the country it is good for the
State.
Mr. KELLEY. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a question?
Mr. STEVENSON. 1 cannot yield. If the
country should pay f@r it New York should
pay first. If the country should give bounty
New York should give bounty first. And when
New York is exhausted let her call on the
country. In Ohio weare adopting this system.
When a town wants manufactories the town
raises and advances the money to build them,
and that is sound policy. If reducing the
duties on pig-iron and placing coal on the
free list bears hard on Pennsylvania she can
afford it. Let her abate her State taxes on
these interests. It is entertaining and some-
what surprising to examine the records of the
State of Pennsylvania and see her local policy
in this regard. In the report of her auditor
general for 1867 you will find that the State
of Pennsylvania derived a revenue for State
purposesinlhatyearof $5,423,330 07, of which
,?2,lJ88,3(jl 79 carnc principally from the inter-
ests of coal, iron, and oil.
Mr. NEGrLJiY. Allow mo a word.
Mr. STEVENSON. No, sir; 1 cannot
yield.
Mr. NEGLEY. I would like to correct the
gentleman.
Mr. STEVENSON. You cannot correct
the book".
Mr. NEGLEY. 1 can correct the fact.
Mr. STEVENSON. No, you cannot cor-
rect the record. It is here in the report. Ilere
is a statement from the report of the auditor
for 1867:
Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from
1 st of December, 1.806, to 1st of November, lSt>7—Sum-
mary of the receipts:

Coal and iron mining and iron manufactur-
ing are conducted almost exclusively by cor-
porations or companies, and the railioad and
canal companies are ultimately connected with
and dependent upon coal and iron operations.
When a corporation is organized ill Pennsyl-
vania a fee is charged for enrolling the law
granting the charter. This ranges from $10 to
$1,000, generally from $110 to $410; and every
supplementary act mast pay an additional fee.
Next, the new company must pay a premium
on its charter. These range from small sums
to thousands of dollars; some cost $4,000.
Then annual taxes begin, and a yearly levy
is made on the "corporation stock," which
ranges from hundreds to thousands and tens of
thousands annually; some transportation com-
panies paying $50,000, $00,000, and $70,000,
and several from $100,000 to $130,000 per
annum.
Next comes the tax on gross receipts; then
the tax on net earning or income, which draws
money annually from these corporations by
thousands. Many coal and iron companies
pay in from $5,000 to $10,000, others from
$10,000 to $20,000, and some from $20,000 to
$30,000 per annum. Then there is the tax on
loans and the coal tax; and finally, covering
everything that is moved to market, the ton-
nage tax, which yields the State from $600,000
to $700,000 per annum. The manifold and
multiform taxes cover all alike, whether they
be banks, insurance companies, transportation
or manufacturing companies, and without re-
gard to their productions. There is no par-
tiality, no favor, no bounty, no exemption.
The exactions are laid equally and enforced
with a vigorous hand ; and yet the State which
maintains such a system as this in her local
taxation, and supports her State government
by it, asks us to give bounties to sustain the
industries she taxes. Here is a statement of
the receipts from these sources for the year
1808:
Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from
.December ], 1SG7, to Nooember 30,1868—summary of
the receipts.
Tax on corporation stocks  $1,061,003 08

included  5,216,049 55

And hero is another for the year 1SG9 :
Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from
JJeccmber 1, 1868, to November 30,1869—summary of
the receipts.
Tax on corporation stocks  $1,037,172 05
Tax on loans  340,81(5 19
Tax on net earnings or income  310,895 38
Tax on gross receipts  373,420 71

2,957,450 79
Sum total, above items included  5,241,711 28
Balance from all other sourccs $2,281,260 49
To recapitulate, the receipts from the above
sources were:
In 1867 $2,988,358 f>9
In 1868  3,172,248 37
In 1869  2,957,450 79
Total in three years $9,118,057 85
Over $3,000,000 per annum. That was the
amount raised annually for the last three years
from these in common with other corporate
interests. That is the policy of Pennsylvania
at home. While we give her bounties on her
iron and coal she puts millions of those boun-
ties into her treasury. Ah! she is shrewd!
New England heretofore has had the reputa-
tion of great adroitness in taking care of her
own interests, but Pennsylvania carries off the
palm. Quietly she sits looking out lor her-
self, we giving bounty, she appropriating it.
And now. what is the result? If we suppose,
for the sake of argument, that the tariff on iron
and coal is added to the cost, then Pennsylva-
nia received a premium on her production of
iron and coal, in 18G8, of $14.2-j1M18, as the
following table will show:
