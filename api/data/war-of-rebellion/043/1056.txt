INHABITANTS CONFIRMED THE STORY OF THE SCOUT ABOUT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE
  ENEMY'S CAVALRY. WE CHARGED INTO MIDDLEBURG, BUT FOUND NOTHING EXCEPT THE
  TRACKS OF THE CAVALRY ON THE ROAD LEADING TO ALDIE. PICKETS WHERE THROWN OUT
  IN EVERY DIRECTION, AND A POSITION TAKEN IN A WOOD ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE
  TOWN TOWARD HOPEWELL GAP. THE PICKETS WERE ATTACKED ON EACH ROAD ABOUT THE
  SAME TIME BY THE BRIGADE RETURNING FROM ALDIE, AND BY ANOTHER BRIGADE
  (ROBERTSON'S) COMING FROM UPPERVILLE. THE PICKETS HELD THEIR GROUND MANFULLY,
  BUT WERE OVERPOWERED AND RETIRED WITH SOME LOSS. AFTER DRIVING IN THE PICKETS
  THE ENEMY (ROBERTSON'S BRIGADE IN ADVANCE) CHARGED DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD OUR
  POSITION, BUT WERE HANDSOMELY REPULSED BY THE CARBINEERS, DISMOUNTED, IN THE
  WOODS AND BEHIND THE STONE WALLS. ONLY ONE-THIRD OF THE REGIMENT WAS ARMED
  WITH CARBINES. THREE SUCCESSIVE CHARGES WERE REPULSED BY THE DISMOUNTED MEN,
  WHEN THE ENEMY DISMOUNTED A LARGE NUMBER OF MEN AND NEARLY SURROUNDED THE
  WOODS IN WHICH OUR POSITION HAD BEEN TAKEN. WE THEN RETIRED UNDER COVER OF THE
  NIGHT TOWARD LITTLE RIVER. SOME OF OUR MEN, MISTAKING THE ENEMY'S COLUMNS FOR
  OUR OWN, WERE CAPTURED IN THIS ENGAGEMENT, BUT WE LOST NONE KILLED OR WOUNDED.
  THE ENEMY'S LOSS IN THIS NIGHT ATTACK CAN ONLY BE ASCERTAINED FROM THEMSELVES,
  AND THEY ADMIT FROM 25 TO 150. MAJOR FARRINGTON, WITH OTHER OFFICERS AND A FEW
  MEN WHO HAD BEEN DISMOUNTED, LAY CONCEALED NEAR MIDDLEBURG DURING THE NIGHT
  AND ALL THE NEXT DAY, ARRIVING SAFELY AT ALDIE ON THE 19TH. WE LAY ALL NIGHT
  ON THE BANKS OF LITTLE RIVER IN A VERY SECLUDED SPOT, INTENDING IN THE MORNING
  TO FIND OUR WAY OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO ALDIE. ON THE MORNING OF THE 18TH,
  COMING OUT OF OUR HIDING PLACE, WE DISCOVERED THE ENEMY COMPLETELY SURROUNDING
  US. WE FORCED A WAY, HOWEVER, TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS, BUT WITH SEVERE LOSS, AND
  RETREATED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. WE SUFFERED VERY SEVERELY IN OUR RETREAT,
  ONLY 84 REACHING THE LINES OF OUR ARMY. OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED SOME FOUND THEIR
  WAY ON FOOT OVER THE MOUNTAINS, BUT MOST FOLLOWED COLONEL DUFFIE THROUGH
  HOPEWELL GAP. THERE WERE MANY INSTANCES OF COOLNESS AND COURAGE ON THE PART OF
  OFFICERS AND MEN, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN HANDSOMELY ACKNOWLEDGED. THIS
  REGIMENT TOOK NO PART IN ANY OF THE OTHER ENGAGEMENTS AT MIDDLEBURG OR
  UPPERVILLE. OUR LOSS IN THE AFFAIR WAS:  Officers and men.KilledWoundedMissing and prisonersTotalCommissioned officers.13610Enlisted men47193204Total510199214
