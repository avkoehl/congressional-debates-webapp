On 21st advanced through Blue Pond; took the road to Gadsden; sharp skirmishing, and toward evening engaged a DIVISION and a brigade formed behind breast-works; charged the works and took them. On the 22d, 23d, and 24th employed in gaining information and compelled to drive the enemy from point to point.

Numbers 75. Reports of Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick, U. S. Army, commanding THIRD Cavalry DIVISION.
HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAV., DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND, Atlanta, Ga., September 30, 1864.

CAPTAIN: The following dispatch from General Kilpatrick:
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION, September 30, 1864-10. 30 a. m.

Have had considerable skirmishing in my front this a. m. on Camp Creek; have driven the rebel cavalry back across the Sweet Water. They are now barricading the fords on that stream. Had 2 men killed and 5 wounded, and lost several horses killed and wounded. I have 100 men on the opposite side of the river watching the Sweet Water. I have very few people to guard so long a line; my picket from Mount Gilead Church to the left should be relieved by infantry; 150 men will be sufficient; can they not be spared?

J. KILPATRICK.

The brigade of Second DIVISION from Roswell has probably reached the Sweet Water by this time, although it is small.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier General and Chief of Cav., Dept. of the Cumberland.
