HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 14, 1862 - 3 p. m. (Received 3.30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

As fast as transportation is ready we shall move to the new line of operations. It is important that the available force at Fort Monroe should be under the control of the commander of the army acting there, and I desire to form another division, under Mansfield, from the troops now in the vicinity of Fort Monroe, and to annex that division to the First Army Corps as soon as McDowell is confirmed as major-general. First Corps leads the movement.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.
