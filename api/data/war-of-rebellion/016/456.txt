Great credit and praise are due to Chaplain Moore, Sixth New Jersey Volunteers, for his unceasing attentions to our wounded on the field, and also to each and ever surgeon of the brigade for their faithfulness on this as well as on many other occasions.

I am proud of my brigade, and esteem it an honor of no mean order to command such a body of men and soldiers, who, not only by their gallantry on the field of battle, but also by their good conduct and strict devotion to duty in camp, have reflected so much credit upon themselves, their noble division, and the States which they so faithfully represent.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. B. CARR,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
