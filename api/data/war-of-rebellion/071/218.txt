HDQRS. THIRD SEPARATE Brigadier, 8TH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, July 11, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel S. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Eighth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that Colonel Pierce, Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, has not yet reported to me, nor can I learn of his whereabouts. I intend when he reports to have him reorganize the cavalry, which seems to be entirely without control. I stopped during the night some thirty, who I have now at this post (Fort Numbers 1). I have also the honor to report that under your instructions Colonel De Witt has been directed to detail an officer to take charge of the infantry stragglers who were arrested and sent in by my patrols.

Very respectfully,

JOHN R. KENLY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
