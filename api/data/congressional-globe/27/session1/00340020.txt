CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
The attention of Congress is re pecfu 1/ invited
to the necessity of early and effectual measures is
prevent its further augmentation The obvious
remedy is to increase the revenue as far as may b«
without unreasonably burdening commerce, and to
reduce the expenditures withm the limi s of strict
economy.
But as it may not comport wi'h the views of
Congress to go into a revision and adjustment of
the customs so long before the act of March 2,
1833, comes to have its final and pcmanent opera-
tion, the undersigned would respectfully recom-
mend, as a temporary measure, the levy of a duty
of 20 per cent, ad valorem on all articles which are
now free of duty, or which pay a less duty than
20 per cent, except gold and silver, and the arti-
cles specifically enumerated in the 5th section of
the act of March 2, 1833.
If this measure be adopted, >t is estimated that
there wdl be received into the Treasury from cus
torn*, m the Lst quarter of the present year, about
#5 300,000; in all of the year 1842, about
#•22,500,000 and in the year 1843, after the final
redaction under the act of March 2, 1833, about
#20,800 000. The details of this estimate will be
iound in the accompanying paper, marked E, and
enclosures.
It is believed that, after ths heavy expenditures
required for the public service in the present j ear
shall havs been provided for, the revenues which
will accrue from that, or a nearly proximate rate
of duty, will be sufficient to defray the expenses rf
Government, and leave a surplus to be annually
applied to the gradual payment cf the national
debt, leaving the proceeds of the public lands to be
disposed of as Congress shall think fit.
The general principles on which the final revi-
sion^ the tariff is to rest are perhaps simple and
easy to be apprehended, but the work of revision
itself, in its adaptation and detail, mast be a work
©f time It should be done on calm reflf etion and
careful deliberation, wtth a view to reconcile, a*,
far &% possible, the conflicting opinions, and to pro-
mote all the various inter sts of the whole people
of these United States And it may be important,
in that adjustment, not only to reciprócate on fair
and equal principle*, and in a liberal «pint, the
conces'iois which may be accorded to our com-
merce by foreign nations, but also to do justic  to
our own eitiz ns by meeting \n a like equal -pint
any heavy exactions Oi pi ohib tions which foreign
nations may think fit to impose upon the importa-
tion of our staple pioductions
Some legal provw ns are also required to cor-
rect inequalities between the duties upon sugu
and mela«ses, and the drawbacks upon refined su-
gar and mm, manufactured or distilled fiom fo-
reign materials. The relation between the duty
and the drawback wa* adjusted by the <i< ts of Ja-
nuary 21st, 1329, an J May 29¡b, 1830, tuco which
time the duties have ben dimmishe i, while t^e
drawbacks remain the same. And a pro i io,i of
law declaring that all non-enumented articles
which bear a similitude to an} enumerated artice
chargeable with duty sh*H pp • the *ae e tate (f

dustry relieved from tr-eir present s'a'e of i rihar-
rassment and depression, and a ben'gn and liberal
policy oh the part of the General Government
shculd call forth once more the hardy industry and
active enterprise of our people, and the vast resour-
ces of our country.
If we assume the period of from five to eight
years as that in which this debt can be paid with-
out inconvenience and embarrassment—and the
time appears to be short enough—we have one of
the most essential elements on winch to form our
judgment a  to the best and most convenient mode
in which the loan can be kept up, and the credit
of the Government sustained
In the mception and during the progressive in-
crease of a national debt, the issues of Treasury
notes, though dangerous and delusive, have yet
their advantages. They need not be issued faster
than the actual wants of the Treasury require;
and the power to issue any given sum is, for all
effective purposes of immediate expenditure, a
fund in the Tieasury available to tttat amount
But, when the debt has acquired us maximum and
ceases to accumu ate; or when it becomes larger
than the amount necessary to be kept on hand to
meet the current wants of the Treasury, these ad-
vantages disappear This mode of loan then be-
comes to the Government what the sale m market
of new promissory notes, for the purpose of raising
money to take up old promi sory notes, is to an
individual. It is the issue of Treasury no'es to
, take up other Treasury notes year after year in
succession, and, under thosa circumstances, it is
inconvenient and expensive.
Bat the raising of money by the issue of Trea-
sury notes is objectionable, because u is deceptive;
by this means a heavy debt may be raised and
fastened permanently upon the country the amount
of new issues being involved with the payment of
the old, while the people, and even those who ad-
minister the finances, may not be impressed with
the important lact that a national debt is created
or i" the process of cre-ition.
Therefore, in the opinion of the undersigned,
when a nation.il debt do s exist, -ind inu>t continue
for a time, it is better thai it should be made a funded
debt, according to our ancient financial u«age It
U then sheltered by no cover, and is the subject of
no delusion It is open, palpable, trne; the eyes of
the c tuniry will be upon it, and wilt be s,bie ?t a
glance to mark us reduction or its increase, and it
is believe I thna loan for the requisite amount, hav-
ing eiaht years to run, but redeemable at the will
of the Government tn six months' notice, could
bi negolia'ed at a much le^s rate of interest than
Treasury notes Much expense would also be
saved in dispensing with the machinery of tne issue
and payment and canceling of Treasury note*.
It is therefote respectful y recommended that a
sum sufficient to \ ay the debt at presen existing,
and such as w '1 necessanlv accrue in thi> and f>e
ensuing j i ar, be rai*ed on loan for the time and
on tne c j  h' oi above s igsei«"d

ihe ptr.od at<v r meJ   many  rt.evw  offi ers
connected with the Treasury Dtpariment'have b - I
come defaulters to the Governm-nt.    The a^gre. j
gate loss from that cause within that period, as
shown by the books of the Department, amounts
to $2,620 500 but a sm?ll part of which will pro-
bably be recovered from their bond". It is true
that, m any system which can be adopted, some
part of the public money must, in the process of
collection, pass through the hands of individuals,
and be vutj«ct to their defalcations; but the act
of Ju'y 4, 1840, extends and continues the risk
beyond the period of collection, and it subjects
large masses which, in the fluctuation  of com 
merce, sometimes accumulate, to the same dange-
rotiv custody.
Not only is the public money m the hands of
individuals more exposed to loss from ordinary de-
falcations than whfn deposited m a well regu-
late^ bank; but the Government is also liable
to the risks of fire, robberj, and other casual-
ties, occurring either in d posite or transmis-
sion, from which it is entirely protected when a
well regulated bank is the depository and the fiscal
agent.
The present system is also, in many respects,
cumbrous and inconvenient. Its tendency is to
centre the disbursements of the pt'blic moneys at
some of the Eastern cities, chiefly at New York.
That being the great commercial emporium of the
United States, is the point at which funds are ihe
most valuable, and, therefote, the most sought,
hence those who are entitled to payments outot the
public Treasury,clatm them there It í'true there is
a general discretion in the nead of the Department
to refuse or grant the favoi of such payments, ac-
cording to us convenience; but when the currency
is deranged, and the premium on exchanges is
his>h, this discretion involves discrimination to a
lar«;e amount among creditors equal!/ entitled. It
then becames a dangerous discre ion, and one that
ought not to exist. But, under the present system,
it cannot be avoided, save in a few cas>-s, wnhout
discharging every public liability at the most fa-
vored point This wou'd at once centre all the
clistursemeniv at a few of the Eastern cities, and
involve the Tieasury in the risk and expense of
transporting the pub'ic funds fiom the various
points of collecion io the pipes of disbursement
An item of less importance, but still worthy of
consideration, in settling oía perminent and eco-
no't ical arrangement, is tne direct expense of the
pre^nt system, including th  co^t of the bui'dings
tor the deposite of the public rnons', and the rala-
ríes of the officers and tnure'erks who receive and
disburse it No portion of this risk, inconvenience,
er expense, need to be incurred where a well-re-
gulated bank is made the fiscal agen'.
But the present system is also, in the opinen of
the undersigned, injurious to the business and cur-
rency of the country Inse d of peimit in  the
credit and the finances of t e Government to lend
their indirect but efftcie.it a d in si siaimng 'ne cre-
di, and resu'anng ihe euirency tf the country, it
