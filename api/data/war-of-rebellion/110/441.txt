Brigadier-General FEATHERSTON:

GENERAL: I sent You Orr's regiment and some ammunition last night by Peytona. I wish you would make yourself easy about being cut off by Lower Deer Creek. General Lee has gone there with a force, and will, I believe, not only prevent the enemy from turning down Deer Creek, but will make him every uneasy and timid about advancing on you. Do not detain the steamers, but send some of them with Captain Quaite after supplies. He is a man of great energy, and can get plenty up Sunflower, where Dew Drop has just been. See if you can have steamers Meares and Golden Age brought down. Use your cavalry, if possible, in getting in tools and negroes in order to leave off Deer Creek. This accomplished will of itself almost defeat the whole movement, and at least compel the enemy to try Lee. It is most important for your well-doing not to detain the boats. We have few, and must try our best to get down the supplies from Sunflower. I think we can re-enforce you as fast as the enemy can be re-enforced. You have checked him. Lee will disconcert him on this side, and I have no doubt you will not only Rolling Fork, but will drive him back to Black Bayou. Your officers will seem confident and cheerful, and you have splendid troops. I shall use eery effort to press Lee, so that Sherman will be very cautious. You have most energetic, excellent officers in Cummins, Ferguson, and Bridges, and Quaite is the best commissary or quartermaster I know. You have already done much. I hope you will be able to follow it up. Shall send up more ammunition immediately.

I am, general, sincerely yours,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General FETHERSTON:

GENERAL: General Stevenson directs that the steamers Sharp and Emma Betts be used to procure supplies from Sunflower, or wherever else Captain Quaite can find them. You will have to depend on them as your means of sustaining your brigade. We will try to send you trenching tools, but Quaite can also get some by the boats. Can't you use your captured barges as express boats. Can't you use your captured barges as express boats, or have you skiffs?

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.
