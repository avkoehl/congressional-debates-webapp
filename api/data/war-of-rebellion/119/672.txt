STATE OF OHIO, County of Franklin, ss:

I certify on honor that on this 7th day of December, 1863, personally appeared before me, Frederick J. Fay, a notary public in and for the country of Franklin and State of Ohio, Robert Lamb, who being by me duly sworn, deposes and says that he is captain of Company F, of the Eighty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteer Infantry; that he was present at the Ohio penitentiary, in the city of Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday, morning, the 28th day of November last, in company with General George B. Wright, Lieutenant Mark W. Goss, and Nathaniel Merion, the warden of said penitentiary, at which time a conversation was had as to the escape of General John Morgan, in which conversation the said Merion, warden as aforesaid, stated that it would never have occurred if the cells had been swept out daily. Lieutenant Goss inquired, "Why the sweeping dispensed with?" Said warden replied, "One of the directors said let the God-named rebels clean their own cells; "and that thereupon Mr. Heavy, the prison guard who had charge of that duty, was notified to stop it, and the prisoners were told they must sweep for themselves. Deponent further says that he was present at the examination of Sergeant Moon by Colonel Wallace, and said Moon's answers were, in effect, that he was sent to the penitentiary to act as steward to the rebel prisoners confined therein; that he, Moon, had received no orders to clean, sweep, or inspect the cells occupied by said rebel prisoners from General Mason or any of this staff; that he, Moon, had no authority or control over said prisoners, except as ordered by the warden of said penitentiary, and that the guard placed at the said penitentiary were entirely subject to said warden's orders.
