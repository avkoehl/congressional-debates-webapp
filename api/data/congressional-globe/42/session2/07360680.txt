, Increase of 1860 over 1850, eighty-five per cent. Increase of 1870 oyer 1860, one hundred and twenty-
eight per cent.
At, thecensu^ of 1870 the products of tho mines and fisheries are not included with the manufactures,
as heretofore. In 1860 the products of the mines and fisheries amounted to about ninety million dollars.
We must have diversified industries and
well-paid labor, and we must control our own
markets.
''It cannot be repeated too often that a nation,
whether she buy from abroad or produce at home,
can have no more than sheproduces. 'l'he develop-
ment of her domestic producing forces is therefore
the true and only sound test of her prosperity."
New industries are springing up in the West
and South; and this variety of industry must
he the basis of all permanent prosperity in
every section of the country. The West to-
day, more interested in having this tariff so
arranged as to encourage all kinds of manu-
factures than New England, cannot, nor can
the South and West, compete with the low rate
of wages paid to laborers in England, Scot-
land, France, and Belgium. These rates range
from one sixth to one half—never more than
one half—the price paid in the United States.
I hope in this discussion we shall rise above
party and partisan considerations, for I am
quite sure that any party that fails to recognize
tile fact that American labor must be protected
will fail of popular support. Protection to
American industry more than ever before
has become the settled conviction of the
people, and the sooner Congress recognizes
this fact the better. I know denunciation is
easy. It is easy for gentlemen to denounce
protection as robbery. But this is not states-
manship. I can say to gentlemen on the other
side that as soon as they make the Democratic
party tho free-trade party they will have no
followers among intelligent business men and
laborers.
A few gentlemen—less than a dozen—in
this House are clamoring for free trade, and
are trying to force their party to adopt then-
theories. If free trade and direct taxation
should once be tried for one year, nothing
more would be heard of it or its advocates for
the next half century. The early statesmen
of the .Republic encouraged the system of
promoting American industry and American
enterprise.
The people have prospered most under pro-
tection. Look at our prosperity at this time
under the present tariff. Labor is well re-
warded, the nation is advancing more rapidly
in prosperity than ever before, and ws are
paying off our national debt.
The last Congress reduced taxes more than
two hundred and fifty-two" million dollars. The
present Congress, by act of May 1, 1H72, has
made a further reduction of $17,000,000, by
placing tea and coffee on the free list, making
the total reduction thus far $209,000,000; and
now we are engaged in modifying the revenue
laws with a view to a still further reduction of
at least $33,000,000, which, if consummated,
will make $50,000,000 for this session, and a
total since the war of $302,000,000. I think,
instead of a reduction of $50,000,000 this
session, we can safely make it §00,000,000
if we place this reduction so ns to bear on
those articles that we do not produce or manu-
facture in this country.
Notwithstanding these immense reductions
of taxes, the public debt since March 1, 1869,
has been reduced more than three hundred
and twenty million dollars, and the country
to-day is in a condition of unparalleled pros-
perity.
And now, Mr. Speaker, with all this unex-
ampled prosperity in the country under the
beneficent provisions of the present tariff, why
should Congress destroy it by a large reduc-
tion of dmies on the productions of all of the
great business interests of the country, thus
striking down its agricultural, its mechanical,
its manufacturing, and especially its labor in-
terests? The growth of the industrial interests
of this country have be^n marvelous under the
present protective tariff, as they have been
under every tariff that looked to the interest
of labor for the last half century. This prin-
ciple of protection received the sanction of
Washington in the very first year of his admin-
istration, as it, has the support of every suc-
cessful Administration since. It is true that
labor and progress have had to contend from
the first with local and class prejudices and
with the influence of foreign nations.
It is a part of the well-established history
of the country that the business interests of
the country were prostrated by the unfortun-
ate legislation that was had the few years
preceding 1820. In 1820 the average rate of
duties were increased about thirty per cent.,
and ranged between thirty and forty per cent,
for a time, and when highest the country was
most prosperous. But the reduction that com-
menced in 1832, reaching an average duty of
only fifteen per cent, m 1834, ended in bank-
ruptcy in 1837, when the average duty was
only twelve per cent. An increase of duties
in 1842 again brought prosperity, which con-
tinued until the revenue tariff of 1846, under
which came disaster and bankruptcy. Again,
by the act of March 3, 1857, the average rate
of duties were reduced to seventeen per cent.,
which increased importations in that year to
the enormous sum of $301,000,000, an amount
unequaled in any former year. Then came
the general distress and bankruptcy of that
year as the legitimate result.
During the last eleven years under a pro-
tective tariff our industries have expanded,
and the laborer has received good wages and
constant employment. The savings banks
show a larger amount of savings by the labor-
ing classes than in any previous ten years.
More comfortable homes have been secured,
and more general prosperity. If these depos-
its should be withdrawn, as they must be when
an influx of cheap foreign goods shall deprive
our laborers of work, then would we witness
again financial distress and loss, both to the
employer and the laborer.
The gentleman from New York [Mr. Brooks]
and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Kerr]
are constantly charging that the tariff is in
the interest of the manufacturer against the
farmer, and in the interest of the employer
and against the laborer, l'he forr- ,e are
denounced as monopolists and robbers, and
we are told the laborers in consequence are
poorly paid, suffering, starving. It is an idle
denunciation, made m the interest of the for-
eign capitalist and against our own laborers
and all the great industrial interests of the
country.
Nor is it true, as the advocates of free trade
assert, that a tariff is solely in the interest of
the manufacturer. If their claim be true that
the duty on imported articles adds so much to
the price—and this, they assert, goes into the
pockets of manufacturing monopolies—then
it must be true that the duty on imported arti-
cles which the farmer produces adds so much
to the articles produced by him. We pro-
duced hist year two hundred and forty million
bushels of wheat, protected by a duty of twenty
cents per bushel, making $48,000,000; also,
eleven hundred million bushels of corn, pro-
reeted by a duty of ten cents per bushel, mak-
ing $110,000,000; also, two hundred and fifty
million bushels of oats, protected by a duty
of ten cents per bushel, making $25,000,000.
We have, then, according to the doctrine of
the free-traders, on these three articles alone,
an aggregate duty of $183,000,000 for the ben-
efit of farmers. Now, if we add barley, pota
toes, butter, cheese, beef, pork, bacon, live ani-
mals, wool, and all other agricultural produc-
tions which are protected, we shall discover
at once that the farmer as well as the manu-
facturer is protect-d, and, what is of more
importance to him, he finds a market at home
for his products.
The interest of the farmer, the manufacturer,
and the laborer all harmonize, and the voice
of each is for protection to home industry ;
and by this system of protection new kinds of
useful manufactures are established, and soon
the buyer pays less for these articles manufac-
tured at home than he formerly paid for foreign-
made goods.
Under the present tariff the wool-growing in-
terest has greatly improved ; and while manu-
facturers are paying a larger price for wool,
they arc generally satisfied without any ma-
terial reduction of the duties on this article.
The following petition, forwarded to me from
the leading woolen manufacturers of New
England, shows the harmony of interest that
exists between the manufacturers and the wool-
growers. Many of these manufacturers are
from. Connecticut, and several are from the
district i represent:
lo the honorable Senate and House of Representatives
o1 tile United htatcz in Congress assembled:
The petition of tho undersigned woolen manufac-
turers, operating respectively the number of sets of
w,ritten against our names,
respectfully showeth: that the present tarili on wool
and woolen goods is satisfactory to all the wool
