any point, and although the road has as yet sustained little damage, it is impossible, under present circumstances, to operate it. The safe passage of the trains could not be relieved on. If the Danville road cannot be made to supply our wants we shall inevitably suffer. That road is also subject to the inroads of the enemy, and no doubt will be injured as at present by the expeditions organized against it. Still it is not more liable to injury than other roads upon which we have had to depend, and can be in a measure protected. If arrangements are made at once to repair the injuries it has received, and preparations made to replace bridges, &amp;c., which may hereafter be destroyed, and the road equipped and worked to its full capacity, I do not see why we cannot be as well supplied as heretofore. But if this cannot be done I see no way of averting the terrible disaster that will ensue.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The enemy has been quiet to-day in our front. A dispatch dated 25th was received this morning from Captain Farinholt, commanding at Staunton River bridge, expressing his confidence of being able to protect it. This afternoon General W. H. F. Lee reports that he attacked the enemy near Staunton River bridge yesterday afternoon and drove him until dark. He also states that the enemy was signally repulsed at the bridge the same evening and retreated this morning, leaving about thirty of his dead on the field.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,
