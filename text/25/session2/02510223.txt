IN SENATE,
Tuesday, March G, I83S
Mr LINN presented the petition of the Milwaukee and
Rosk river canal company, and remarked that previous to his
moving its, a leference to the appropriate committee, as the pc
tiuon was of considerable impon mee to the public, and thepe
Winners he begged leave to give a shoit sta'ement of it* con
tents
The petitioners sav that fhe Legislative Assembly of Wiscon
sin T^rr tory have mcmpoiated a company for the purpose of
constructing a canal from la'ce Mienigan, at Milwaukie, to
Rock river, whereby a navigable communication will be
effected between the lakes and tiie Mississippi The charter
empowers the Company to ask of *he General Government, on
behalf of the Teuitorj, such aid as maj be deemed proper and
expedient, and provides that whatever aid shall be ho granted,
may accrue to the benefit of the ¡state a.fta its organization It
also provides that the'■aid State at any time after HbOisaniza
tion, without any other limitation of time than its own plea
sure, may take possession of the works constructed by the com
pany, including the canal and all its appendent pnvileges, by
refunding the amount, and interest, by them expended in such
eonstruction, aside from any apptopuauon which may be made
by the Government, *lu*s securing to tho State all the benefits
ausing from such appropriation, as effectually as if made to the
State after its organization
The memouafnow presented, comes fi om tne eompany thua
mcorpoiated, and asks for an appropriation in lands similar to
the grants made to the States of Ohio, Indnna, and Illinois to
aid m their respective work'' which piss thro"_,h the public
lands, to be placed at the disposal of the Territorial legisla
ture, and the pioceeds to he applied to the construction oi the
canal
The memorialists further ¡=ay that trie canal line from Mil
waukie to Rock uver, lies entirely tvithm lands owned by the
Government, witn the exception of from two to three miles at
the eastern ter rnitio i at Mil wa ikie and should Congress con-
eider this woifc of si fficiei t importance and public utility to
jua*ify such a grant n its aid a? is solicited it will be appaient
that m oider to secure the full benefi of the grant, both is ie
gards the Goveinmenrm the sale of the alternate sections, and
as legards theTerrito y i he vaUc of the giant, and die eseou
tion of the work, it should oe made before a sale of the public
lands through which it pi^egehal! ta' e place
Tne nemonal presents a brief wew and de^cuption of the
country, and of the obj ~ts of general ínteres* tobe pr jmote thy
the proposed work Ihs memoim-iist^ may be regarded m the
light of an agency of the futuie State of W isconbin, rathei than
a company pooscsmig taluable ard permanent pin ¡leges
which mieht secure to then the coraol of the tiansitcom

thus giving additio-m' ^a'ie to ttia . irrpmtant bianch of the
domestic production of the country, try grung to it not only a
choice of market, but fiee access to all the markets of the
eount-w
The memorialise further sav, that the connection hrrecan be
effected m Jess time, in 1 a*. Jes* expert, than at eithei of the
great points in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois and by it equally im
portam objects effected Tne length of the canal is armies
W  ftmoynl oflockage 330 feet, and the line m general 13 iepre?
sented to be of the most fivorable character The estimated
expense, by an experienced engineer, of well established íepu
tation, varies a fraction from $800 000
The memoiiahstseay, that considering the feasibility of the
woik, ana the impoitant objects to be attained by it considering
the state of the countiy, its rapid settlements, its valuable pio
ductions, and its want of facilities for internal trade and mtei
course, a reasonable hope is indulged that Congress will give
the subject that attention to which i* is entitled by its merits,
and their favorable actiou upon the memorial of the company,
by granting said alternate sections of the j.ub'10 land", as was
granted to Ohio, Indiana and Illinois
