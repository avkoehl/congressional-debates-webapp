Almighty God! our great Creator, our kind Preserver, and our gracious Redeemer, we have assembled here at the request of our fellowcitizens, as Thou knowest, for the purpose of exchanging our views respecting the evils which have been brought upon our country by those who are endeavoring to destroy our Government under which we as a nation have so wonderfully prospered. But being aware of our shortsightedness and liability to err, we would hombly and earnestly implore the enlightenings of Thy Holy Spirit that we may be able to accomplish the object for which we were chosen, in the best possible manner. And oh, Divine Sovereign of the universe, we pray Thee to defeat those who are endeavoring to break up our inestimable Government and sustain and relieve those who are now deprived of their constitutional privileges. We have to acknowledge that as a nation we have not appreciated our civil and religious privileges, but have abused Thy goodness. But we would meekly importune Thee, our Heavenly Farther, to pardon our national sins, allay the fierce and hostile excitement that prevails in many sections of our country, suppress the further shedding of blood in civil war. Grant, we beseech Thee, O. Lord, that we may again become a united people, secured in the enjoyment of our former inestimable civil and religious privileges and to Thy great and glorious name, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, we will ascribe present and everlasting praises. Amen.
