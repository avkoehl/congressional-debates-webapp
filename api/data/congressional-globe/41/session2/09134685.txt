the Secretary of War to deliver to the Soldiers'
Monument Association at Hightstown, New
Jersey, for the ornamentation of the soldiers'
monument at that place, four pieces of con-
demned bronze cannon suitable for that pur-
pose.
Mr. IIAIGHT. I demand the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the joint resolution was ordered
to a third reading; and it was accordingly
read the third time, and passed.
Mr. HAIGHT moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. LOGAN. I ask unanimous consent to
introduce for consideration at the present time
a joint resolution, granting condemned cannon
to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument Asso-
ciation of Delaware,
* The SPEAKER. The joint resolution will
be read for information, after which objections
may be made, if any.
The joint resolution was read. It proposes
to authorize the Secretary of War to donate
certain condemned cannon to the Soldiers' and
Sailors' Monument Association of Delaware,
for the monument in memory of the soldiers
and bailors of that State who died in defense
of the Union.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I should like to know
how much more condemned cannon there is.
Mr. LOGAN. There is any amount of it.
Mr. ELDEIDGE. Then I make no objec-
tion.
Mr. SCHENCK. There is a jointresolution
which makes a general provision for granting
condemned cannon to municipal authorities.
This would apply to all such cases as this, and
I object to all these special resolutions.
The SPEAKER. The grant here is pro-
posed to be made, not to municipal corpora-
tions, but to a monument association.
Mr. SCHENCK. Under the joint resolu-
tion to which I refer any State, county, or
town may apply for these grants. I would
prefer to make the provisions broad enough
to give all a chance.
The joint resolution was received, read three
times, and passed.
Mr. PACKER. I ask unanimous consent
to introduce a joint resolution donating four
condemned cannons to company C forty-seventh
Pennsylvania volunteers.
Mr. SCHENCK. I object to this, _ as I
objected to the similar joint resolution intro-
duced by the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr.
Logan.] on the ground that I want a general
law on the subject.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Schexck] state that he objected to
the introduction of the joint resolution of the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Logan] as well
as to the joint resolution ot the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Packer'?]
Mr. SCHENCK. I do. .
The SPEAKER. The joint resolution ot
the gentleman irom Illinois was declared to
have passed; but after the statement of the
gentleman from Ohio, that he objected, that
action will be considered rescinded.

sent to report back irom the Committee 011
the Pacific Railroad House bill No. 1^27, to
authorize the construction of a bridge across
the Missouri river, with amendments.
The SPEAKER. The bill will be read, after
which objections to its consideration at this
time will be in order. r
The bill, which was read, provides fnat lor
the more perfect connection of any railroads
that are or shall be constructed to the Missomi
river, at or near Council Buffs, /Owa-> .ant'
i Omaha, Nebraska, the Missouri River bridge
i Company be. and ishereby, authorized to con-
I struct and maintain a bridge over said river

shall be and remain a military and post road.
The amendments were to insert "Railway"
between " Missouri River" and "Bridge Com-

and " Council Bluffs." Also to add to the bill
the following:
And provided further, Thatthespnns of said bridge,
from pier to pier, shall not be less than two hundred
and fitty feet.
No objection was made to the consideration
of the hill.
Mr. WELLS. I move to amend the last
amendment by striking out "two hundred and
fifty feet" and inserting "three hundred and
fifty feet," so as to provide that the span shall
be three hundred and fifty feet.
The amendment to the amendment was
agreed to, and the amendments, as amended,

MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota, by unanimous
consent, from the Commitee on the Public
Lands, reported back, with the recommenda-
tion that it do pass, the bill (H. R. No. 253)
authorizing the allowance of the claim of the
State of Minnesota to lands for the support
of a State university.
The bill was read. It authorizes and directs
the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
in adjusting the claim of the State of Minne-
sota to lands for the support of a State uni-
versity, to approve and certify selections of
land made by the Governor of said State to
the Mi amount of seventy-two sections men-
tioned in the act of Congress approved Feb-
ruary 20, 1857, without taking into the account
the lands that were reserved at the time of the
admission of the State into the Union and
donated to said State by the act of Congress
approved March 2, 1861.
Mr. BENJ AMIN. Is that bill reported from
a committee ?
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. It is from the
Committee on the Public Lands. It passed
the Senate during the last Congress, but failed
in the House for want of time. It has been
reported by three committees.
Mr. VAN TRUMP. I cannot help making
a single remark in regard to this bill, and I do
so with regret, because I am very anxious^to
agree with my friend from Minnesota. But
in the few moments I have had to examine the
laws making the original grants both to the
Territory and to the State of Minnesota, I have
become reasonably satisfied that the present
bill would be a duplication of the giant and, in
my opinion, the grant to the State of Minne-
sota was intended only to be a confirmation
of the former grant to the Territory. In 18-51
an act was passed to authorize the Legislative
Assemblies of the Territories of Oregon and
Minnesota to take charge of school lands in
said Territories, and for other purposes. 'The
first section of that act providesâ€”
" Thilt the ftnvernors and Legislative AÂ«wml>lie-< of
the Territories ot Oregon and Minnesota be, aim taey
are herebv, nut homed to make such laws and newi-
fulrc-uhitionsns they shall doom mo.sfc expedient in
3/ioleci from injury and wa^te sections nuinpeie'L
sixteen and lhnty-*ix m said Territories, ro.ened
iu eauii ^ nshipfurliie supported sciiools tliciom.
Mr. CULLOM. Is this bill before the House?
i The SPEAKER. It is : the Chair heard 110
i objection to its consideration.
' Mr. CULLOM. I think we had better have
the regulai order.
