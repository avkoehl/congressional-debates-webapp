SIMON CAMERON.

NEW YORK, September 17, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

DEAR SIR: On the 9th instant I addressed to you a respectfully letter on the subject of accepting negro regiments under white officers.*

The rebels are employing negroes on military duty, and in every way availing themselves of their services against us, and I can see no reason why the United States should not employ blacks likewise. There is no doubt that a black regiment from this city could be put into the field in thirty days. Efficient and accomplished white officers are waiting to lead it.

Will you be kind enough to inform me of your decision on the subject?

Very respectfully,

EDWARD VERNON,

148 West Forty-ninth Street.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 17, 1861.

His Excellency Governor PEIRPOINT,

Wheeling, Va.:

DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 9th instant was referred to the Ordnance Bureau, from which the annexed report has been received.

Very respectfully, yours,

JAMES LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk War Department.
