concurrent juiisdiction on this point—and that where the
power was exercised by the pne Government, U could not

was the doctrine of the Supreme Court of the United Slates
It had been argued that a National Bank, as a fiscal agent,
had been decided by the Supreme Com t to be con«tttutional
Without intending any d'siespec' to the memory of the gen
tleman who was at the head ol (hat Court when that point was

And no man would pay moie respect thin he would fo the

A woid on the authomy ofOongiess to repeal chaiters
This Bank was lo be incorporated expressly on the gi ound that
it was to be a fiscal agent—that the wants of the Government te
qjired it—and that, as suck, it was to be established (The
dictrine of the Supreme Court, m more instances than one,
was that the power existed in Congiess, or m any Lcislatme,
to repeal an act which had reference exclusively to the cany
ingout of public powers and dutus ] This charter then, be
ing placed on the ground of the necessity of curving on the
public daues, and performing the public functions of the Govern
rnent, it would at ail times mtbe pnwet oi the Genetal Govern-
ment to repeal it,because, if it were not ¡>o, the liando oí the
Government would be tied for twenty year* to come ¡suppose
the united voice of the people were to decile, at «©me future
day, that this hank was inexpedient—that it dd not canyotit
the purposes lor which it had been created—would it be denied
that the public convenience would demand its repeal at the
hands ofa future Congress
