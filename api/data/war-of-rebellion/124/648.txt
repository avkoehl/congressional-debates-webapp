The three districts to which a quota has not been assigned each gave an anti-Lincoln majority.

The nine anti-Lincoln districts are required to furnish nearly as many conscripts as the nineteen Lincoln districts, although the latter polled more than three times the number of votes. Nothing in respect tot eh draft could be more startling than this conclusive exhibit.

To show that the result is not to be in any degree attributed to any special circumstances attending the election of 1860, I also give a similar statement in respect to the election last fall:

1862.
