ciple chat the resolution was drawn Thi^, he believed, was
the oriy case in which a contested election had been postponed
to anothei session, and the application for postponement had
been made by the sitting membei and not by the con
testor It was true it was the first application for
compensation that had been made pending the con
test, but Lhegiound he went on was this The contentor had,

.............._____...............     -  é$9
Mr FERIUS addressed the House as follow
Mr Speaker This resolution is introduced Willi the view of
extending the paternal care of the Republic to some of her erti-
zenswho have imprudently subjected themselves to tt  penal
Uws of Great Bntain.and are now actually suffering punishment
by exile and hard labor in the penal colonies of that power.
The late insurrection in the Cañadas extended its influence over
the borders, and enlisted the sympathies of the youthful
and ardent They ru&hed to the aid of a peopie whom they
believed to be struggling for liberty and independence. They
were accustomed from early childhood to look upon the Revo-
lution, which gave political existence to their country, as the)
most glorious event in the history of the world, and ail those
who were engaged m it, whether in the council or in the field,
as sages and heroes, as the friends and benefactors of the hu-
man race The loveoflibeity which had brought Lafayette,
Montgomery, McDugal, Dekalb, Steuben, Pulaski, Kosciusko,
and many otheis, from all the endearments of home aDdl
friends to fight her battles m a distant land, srde by side with
their fathers, was chtomcled to them in thenursery, These heroic
names were blazoned on the banners of their national jubilee,
and formed the theme of patriotic song Th^r had seen the
struggles of Greece for freedom, and beheld the formation of
Hellenic Societies, and the raising of contributions in this coun-
try and in England foi her aid They had seen volunteer  go
forth, not only irom their own native land, but from other
counti i, s to assist the patriots, and the immortal Byron draw-
ing hts sword in the same cause. Theyhad beheld tins land of
Pericles and Homer—ol Leónidas and Anstides—this clastic
land oí poets and heioes upon which their youthful imagina-
tions dwelt with admiration and delight, liberated by the 
means from Turkish despotism, and the crescent hosts of Ma-
homet dnven back by warriors fighting under the cross of the
Christian banner They had read of that mighty political con-
vulsion which ovortuined the ancient throne of the Bour-
bons, and beheld France, after overthrowing her institu-
tions, marching through blood and slaughter and, crime,
seeking for freedom, cnamed to the car of an ambitious con-
queror, and her victorious eagles planted on the principal ca-
pitals of prostrate Europe They had read of the oppressed na-
tions rising, and hurling destruction on their oppressors—-the
Bourbons were restored Again they beheld the battle of the
three days oí July, and France imposing under a constitutional
monarchy, the principles of freedom triumphant, and the rights
ofm in acknowledged Theyhad seen the gallant Poles «rik-
mg for freedom, and their heroic bands butchered by Russia's
gigantic powei They had witnessed the kind and hospitable
reception oi the Polish exiles to our shores They had wit-
nessed the struggle between liberal and despotic principles in
Spain and Naples ¿nd other pans of Europe Sometimes
iieedom triumphed, sometimes checked but to renew the battle
at a more auspicious time They had seen all the nations of
South America released from European bondage, and read
with thrilling interest the history oí the bloody contest Ihe
victories, the defeats, the success, the reverses of the patriots,
were all befuie them, and, most gratifying to their hearts, they
beheld at the close of the Revolution the banners of freedom
floatjng from the Andes over half a world. They had wit-
nessed the emancipation of Texas from Mexican thraldom
The glouous battle of San Jacinto had been fought by their
countrymen, it had established the independence of our sister
Republic, hei solitary star now shines as the emblem of freedom,
side by side with the constellation on our national banner The
page of ¡British history was befoie them, they had read Ofth«
Revolution of JbbS, of the story of Russell, of Sydney, of
Hamdem, and imbibed the principles of freedom from the
same great spi mgs as the statesmen who planned, and the*
soldiers who achieved our independence When they sawthe
standard of liberty borne aloft, and heard her voice crying for
succor, is u surjui^mg that they did not stop to examine the
law of nation  the laws of neutrality, the relative
oh'igations due from our citizens to a nation with
whom we v ue at peace, unner treaties of ami
ty and friendship! They did not stop to examine into the
grievance*., the wiongs, the suffeiings complained of, or to m-
quneinto the justice and modelatnn with which the mhabi-
tanteof the Cañadas weiegoverned by the British crown; they
only saw the unnatural position of a people governed by ano-
ther people three thousand miles distant, and a mighty effort
made by a poiuon of the inhabitants of the depen-
dent provinces to fiee themselves from their vassalage.
Thetr youthful enthusiasm blinded them t  the chances of
failure and its consequences, and if aware that they were commit
ting an ofitnee against the power which held the Casadas in
subiection, their generous feelmzs m favor of those whom
they believed to be an oppressed people, hid from them the ul-
terior conserjuenrfs ol their acts and the dangeisthey incurred
B fmetheiryoiuhiul imaginations were visions of glory, but
the gyves, the chain , tin, gibbet, the dungeon, the penal colo
mes of Botany Bay and Van Dieman's land, were concealed
from then view Mo«i fatal delusion, and most grievously
have they atoned for it Most of them were inexperienced young
men, of respectable connections—the sons of our hardy farmers
on the bor leis and of the neighboring territory—and at this
time their families and friends are plunged m gnefarjd distress
at the suffeiings they now endure, and must continue to be ex-
posed to, unless by fuendly negotiations they shall be released
li om their pi esen condition by the power whose laws they have
offen ed
1, i- not intended by this resolution to give any color ol
justification to the acts of these unfortunate men, but simply
to request the interference of our Government in their behalf,
at such times, and in such manner, as may be deemed nioBt
d,scieet and tin. best calculated to accomplish the object pro-
posed, believing thatlhe influences under which they acted,
