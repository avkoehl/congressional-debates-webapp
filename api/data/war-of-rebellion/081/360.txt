HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS.

June 23, 1864.

General MEADE, Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatch received.* We can discover no change in our front except that the enemy appear to be strengthening their works.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,June 23, 1864-8.30 a.m.

General MEADE:

The enemy's attack upon our lines last night was handsomely and quickly repulsed with scarcely any loss to us. Captain Roemer, whose battery they approached, thinks it was intended to have been a formidable attack, but they succeeded in little more than leaving their entrenchments. We have been ready to co-operate with the Sixty and Second since 3.30, if necessary. Has anything been heard from them?

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 23, 1864-5 p.m.

General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

Everything seems comparatively quiet on our front. The mortars appear to be doing good service by driving the enemy out of their rifle-pits and giving our sharpshooters a chance at them. Have you anything new from other lines?

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 23, 1864-5.20 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Wright reports the enemy showing himself on his left; thinks he may be attacked. Is ordered, if practicable, to attack them; all else quiet. We have been destroying the Weldon railroad, and our working party was driven off. General Grant writes that Butler will to-morrow relieve one of your divisions to enable us to extend more to the left.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 23, 1864-6 p.m.

A division will be sent by General Butler to General Smith to-night. General Smith will relieve one of your divisions, and the commanding general directs that you relieve a division of General Warren's on his right.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
