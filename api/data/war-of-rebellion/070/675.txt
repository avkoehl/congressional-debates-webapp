(Received 4.05 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of 10.45 a.m. The command moved this morning. It is my opinion, strengthened by reports received from General Kelley in regard to the enemy's movements in the Valley, that General Hunter will retire to Lewisburg, in which case, if I have positive information. I shall send supplies via Gauley Bridge. I will halt my command at Bunker Hill until further information is received.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, June 25, 1864.

Governor BOREMAN, Wheeling:

Major Hunter, at Beverly, reports his scouts just returned, who were ordered to communicate with General Hunter. They were compelled to return. Found a rebel force of 1,500 holding Calf Pasture Valley, and 3,500 holding Buffalo Gap. Was informed by Union citizens that General Hunter was between Staunton and Lynchburg, with Pickett and Breckinridge in his front. I am almost bare of force, and feel great apprehension for the safety of West Virginia and the railroad.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

N. B. - Scout also reported heavy cannonading in the direction of Lynchburg.

CUMBERLAND, June 25, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER AT OAKLAND:
