THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1820
by the United States Government during and
since the war of the rebellion, have instructed
me to report it back with an amendment. I
ask the unanimous consent of the Senate to
consider the bill at this time. ' i
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution '
(H. R- No. 413) in relation to lands and other ]
property of W. W. Corcoran in the District of j
Columbia used by the United States Govern- ,
irient during and 6ince the war of the rebel-
lion was considered as in Committee of the
Whole. It is an instruction to the Secretary |
of the Treasury to withhold auy and all pay- {
ments of money to W. W. Corcoran for the
use of lands and buildings in the District of
Columbia, supposed to belong to him and j
taken possession of by the War Department ;
during and since the rebellion for national
purposes, umil the further action of Congress. !
The Committee on the District of Columbia
proposed to amend the resolution by striking
outthe words "all further action of Congress"
and inserting:
"Until the said W. W. Corcoran shall have taken
and subscribed before some person duly authorized
to administer oaths the following oath : I, William
\V. Corcoran, do solemnly swear that I have never
voluntarily borne arms against the United States
since T have been a citizen thereof; that I have
voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel, or
encouragement, either personally or by agent, to
persons engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I
have neither sought nor accepted nor attempted to
exercise the functions of any office whatever under
any authority or pretended authority in hostility to
the United States; that I have not yielded a volun-
tary support to any pretended government, author-
ity, power, or constitution within the United States
hostile or inimical thereto; and X do further swear
that to the best of my knowledge and ability I -will
support and defend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic;
that I will render true faith and allegiance to the
same; that I take this obligation freely, without any
mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help
me God. And that said oath so taken and subscribed
shall be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury in
connection with all payments of money for the pur-
poses above mentioned."
The amendment was agreed to. %
Mr. BAYARD. I shall ask for the yeas and
nays on the passage of that bill.
Mr. HOWARD. I wish to put an inquiry
to the honorable Senator from Iowa respecting
this matter. 1 understand that Mr. Corcoran,
a man of large property in this District, quit
it, abandoned it at the commencement of the
war, and went off to reside in a foreign coun-
try, remaining abroad until the close of the
war and a considerable time afterward, and he
has always been reputed, so far as I have heard,
as, if not a direct rebel, one who sympathized
fully with the cause of the rebellion. I should
like to have more explanation of this resolu-
tion from the honorable Senator who intro-
duces it.
Mr. STEWART. Inasmuch as this is going
to take time, I move to lay it on the table and
to take up House bill No. 1880, the disability
bill.
Mr. SUMNER. I hope not. It is a ques-
tion whether certain money shall be paid to
this gentleman.
The joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate as amended, and the amendment was con-
curred in. The amendment was ordered to
be engrossed, and the joint resolution to be
read a third time. The joint resolution was
read the third time.
Messrs. BAYARD and HOWARD called for
the yeas and nays on the passage of the bill;
and they were ordered.
Mr. DAVIS. Mr. President

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky has the floor.
Mr. ANTHONY. Will the Senator from
Kentucky allow me to move to concur in a
verbal amendment of the House?
Mr. DAVIS. I shall vote against this joint
resolution fox the benefit of Mr. Corcoran for
this reason : I believe he is entitled to his prop-
erty without any oath or condition, and 1 will
not vote for a bill that imposes such an oath
upon him.
Mr. ANTHONY. A joint resolution has
just been returned from the House with the
correction of a clerical error, to strike out the

move that the Senate concur with the House.

ment ?
Mr. ANTHONY. "Surgeon Geueral" was

ment is to strikeout the word " surveyor'' and
put in " surgeon."

Mr. BAYARD. I am necessarily opposed to
the adoption of this report: and though I am
reluctant to detain the Senate it will take me
some time to state my objections to it. I am
very loth at this period of the session, with the
pressure of business, to do so, but the act is
one of public importance, and as I view the
second sectiDn, which is restored by this com-
mittee of conference to the form in which the
House of Representatives originally passed it,
it is far more dangerous than will any result to
! be derived from the first section be beneficial,
j I must therefore necessarily oppose the bill,
| though to the first section I have no objection.
I Mr. TRUMBULL. It is impossible to hear a
j word that is said by the Senator from Delaware,
, there is so much confusion in the galleries,
j The PRESIDENT^ro tempore. There must
! be less noise in the galleries.
Mr. BAYARD. The first section I have no
specific objection to except one. and that is
that it is declaratory law, and 1 hold that within
the terms of the Federal Constitution declar-
atory laws by Congress, if not absolutely un-
constitutional, are certainly unwise and im-
