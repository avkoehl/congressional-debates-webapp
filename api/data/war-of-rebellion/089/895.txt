GENERAL: The Church road station reports:

One of the enemy's camps, should think the camp of one regiment of infantry, 10 degrees west of north, has disappeared. It is yet too hazy to see the enemy's position generally, but the above is the only change apparent.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: It has just been reported to me from the Ninth Corps that squads of infantry and stragglers were seen this a. m. upon the Richmond pike, moving toward Petersburg, which would indicate the passage of troops in that direction at an earlier hour. A few tents have been pitched to-day in the vicinity of Butterworth's house.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Colonel and Chief Signal Officer.
