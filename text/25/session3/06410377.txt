prevent him, while in office, from usinghis powers
and patronage with a view to his reelection
I would next render member-* of Congiess in-
eligible to any office which the Piesidentcan con-
fer, duiing the temí fot which they were elected,
and foi two yeais after its expiration My object
in this is to rendei members of Congress inde-
pendent of Executive influence To pieventsub-
seiviency on the part of the member with a view
to procuie Executive favors, it should be impos
siLle for him to receive toe reward Under ¡such
ategulatmn, he would look exclusively to his con-
stituents in dischaigmg his duties
I would allow a majouty of the membei selected
to the Senate and House of Repiesentalives to
eniet laws, notwiths andina; the Piesident's ucio,
instead of lequirmg two thuds of a quorum I
would amend the Constitution in this respect.with
a view to make the Piesident a followei of public
stnliment, as expiessed by the Repiesentativts
of the peop'e, instead of its dlctatoi
I would break up the whole machinery of cau
cuses and conventions m the nomination of can-
did itcs for the Piesidency, by devolving tht duty
of nominating on the Legislatuies of the States,
and I would give a dncct vote to eveiy fiee white
male Citizen of full age, without employing a col
1 ge of electors     Any candidate hating a nnjoi
ity of all the voters should be declaicd duly el ct- j!
ed, if no one hid such imjonty, then Congiess ¡j
should elect,each member having o le vote    1 his   I
change would be moie demon alie, (1 use the teim I
in its. Hue and foimer sense, and not in Us mod-
e-mzid meaning, when uconvevs the idea of sic   II
liScing Constitution and law ai the shrine of an
ekctivc despotism,) and   íendei   tho^e combini   y
Uons impossible by which political jugshis so
manije as tosecuie to themselves the " spoils of '
°   j 
victoiy
I would paitition the Executive power into sev
eral independent depaitmeiits, instead ofconeen-
tiatnig it in the hands of a single man Theie is
too much power lodged by the pieserit Constuu
tion, and the oonstiuction it has received in the
h uids of the Piesident He is too suong foi the
other depaitmenls He can tiample on Constiru
tion and law with impunity He is so povveiful
that hbc ity is m dinger "I here is no remedy, in
my opinion, but to divide his poweis,and to con
fde d stinet poitions to si puate independent ex-
ecutive dcpirtments With tins view, I would
have the Seciitaiy of the Pieasuiy annually
deled by the House of Repiesentalives, and le-
sponsible to it alone, except that 1 would allow
tl  Picsidcnttc airesthim foi official misconduct,
and suspend his action until uelccttd.oi anothei
was ehosin I woild give to the Secntaiy thus
el cted the nomination and appointim nt, by and
with the advice and consent of the Semup, of
eveiy ofhcei whose duty mainly consisted in eol-
¡octm', ipceivmg, or disbursing tlie public reve
mu , and I would pi ice the same barner of ineli-
gibility in the wiy of membeis of Congiess, to
pievent then obtaii ing office fiom the Secietaiv,
which I have aheady mentioned in íegaid to the
Piesident
I would rendei  the Post Office Pepaitment,
with its. twelve thousand five hundied postmas
teis, independent of the Piesident     I would or
g nize this Depaitment as that of the lieasuiy,
in the manner alieadv suggested
1 ngud this division ot the Executive powei
into indi pendent depaitments as an essential in-
gredient in any plan to lefoim the abuses of the
times Sn, the idea of paituioning powei, and
confiding distinct poitions to seoarate bodies of
magistiacy, is the veiy groundwork of Amencan
freedom The accumulation of all power, legisla-
tive, judicial, and executive, into the hands of one
man, lb Mi Jefferson's definition of despotism
That is pieciscly the cusís in the state of public
affairs at piesent With what the Constitution
giants, with what erroneous constitutions hue
conceded, wi h those added which have been al-
bina, lly grasped, tl e Piesident is aheady an elec
t ve nonairh He has a 1 undied times more to
do and to look after, in the various opuationsof
oiu vislgov(inmentUmichine,tiian ítispossib e
for one man to attend to Hi  supei vision is so
genera' Jut it i" uin ostwoithl ss The const
quence is, that he nece«sanly confides to otheis,
and, in domg ¡t, he selects the flattering, unpnn
cipled sycophant, ever ready to burn incense on
the altai of powei, and to sacufice the interests
of the people for then own aggrandizement To
secuie a moie beneficial and faithful superintend-
ence, and, above all, to prevent the concentration
of pationage to a focus, to a single point, aiound
which all the insects and beasts of party swarm
and congregate, nothing can be effectual short of
the paitition proposed It is better to have sev-
eral files diffusing a genial warmth in diffeient
circles 'ban to have but'one of intense and scotch-
ing heat, which endangeis, if it does not con-
same, everything which falls under its influence
If a paitition of Executive power takes place, and
independent depai tments should be established as
pi oposed, you still leave the Pi esident at the head
of the Army and the Navy He is still at the
head of the diplomatic coips, and conducts our
intercouise with the other nations of the eaith
These and his other untouched duties would leave
him employment and patronage enough to engage
all his ficulties
The idea of psi tition which I am now insisting
on is alieady the basis of our institution     We
divide powei into State and national     We have
a Slate executive and a national Executive, per-
foiming different functions in  fulfilling difhrcnt
executive   powtis, and   why  not,   in   the  some
Givi inrrit nt, have different executives, peif >i m
ing diffeient functions m the execution ol diffei-
ent powtis'    By the constitution of neaily, if i
not all the Stites in this Union, the swoid and
the puise aie sepaiatnd it vinculo matnnomi, (ef |

' thing  be done in  i< Mid to Fxnutive povvtis'
Sn, the gnat pnnciple in the whole of it is the
division of laboi      It is the pum iple of civilisa-
tion itself, and it is impossible, in the  natuie of
I things, ill u it should do othei wise thin pi iduce
' the in >st beneficial lesulis    It is about as nnwi'e

It is the hi ight of human folly to disiegaid this

I    may be found who are gieatly incensed, unless
' you admit that they can physic you at night, at-
tend to your law suit in the day, and pieach on
Sunday, better than jEsculapius, my Loid Coke,
and the Apostle Paul1
There is but ow idea more which I wish to
suggest, and men I shall have presented the chief
ingredients of my temedy It is this 1 would
coTiect the erroneous construction of the Consti-
tution by an amendment, declaiing ihat the 1 ios
ident might ai rest, but should not dismiss oi je-
move, an officer, until he should be found guilty
of misfeasance ot malfeasance in office, oi culpi
ble omissions in the pcifoi mince of his dutus,
by tie tubunil estibliM.ed bj law firtiyng the
charges  against him     My ob)ect in doing tins
II  would be to impait an independent feeUng to the
subordinate executive officers,and to rid them of
that tame servility to supei mrs which exists under
the present system    I desire to see them stuetly
responsible to the 1 iw, and not to the caprice or
prejudice of those in higher stations     I wish,
also, to deprive the President of the power to pun-
ish political opponents, and to reward his parti-
sans, by taking office from one without fault, and
giving it to another without meut   I wish to un-
lock the mouth'? of suboidmates    Does any man
believe that Ogden and Phillips could or would
I have looked upon the infamous conduct of Swart-
| wout, with a full knowledge of it during five or
I six yeais, and not open their mouths to inform
the Piesident or the public, if a system of terror
and cormption had not been established under
that power which allows the Piesident to make
arbitiary temovals and appointments '  Sir, they
were afraid to speak when Swartwout began to
plunder, because  at fiist he took small sums,
which he could have replaced, and then denied
then chaigcs, which no one would have believed,
and they would have been dismissed to starva-
tion and ignominy, as slandereis of their noble,
pii  e, and talented supenoi     They did not speak
when they saw Swaitwont taking hundreds of
thousands,   because  they  had  remained   silent
when they knew he was pilftnng, and could not
assign any jeason foi changing their couise at a
litei peiiod, which would not prove a shameful
connivance and want of pnnciple on their part in
allowing him to go on unexposed for so long a
time      I he law does not allow the slave to give
evidence against his master     The consequence
of that pnnciple is, that the slave will see his
unstei commit muidei,and not open his mouth.
1 he pnnciple is the same in kind, if not in de-
gree, which silences the auboidinate under the
system of icmovals and appointments, or punish-
merts and lewaids, introduced into this Govern-
ment by Andiew Jackson '    The system  must
be broken up, sir     It is incompatible with pub-
1k hbeity and sift ty
The silence of these men, Ogden and Phillips,
is a stnkmg lllustiation of the worthlessness of
the sub-lieasuiy scheme, so often pressed by
the Administration and its Inends You will ha\e
two or time keys, each kept by a sepaiate offi-
cer, and each key must be used before getting
into the strong box wheie the treasuie is kept,
and thus, if you can stumble upon one honest
man, you will save the treasuie Good—ad-
muted But my objection is, that your system
of icwards and punishments, your electioneern g
schemes, your pursut of the "spoih," is de-
nioializmg and couupting, and that, until thess
an itlormed, it is useless to talk about locks and
keys and suong boxes, and separate officers to
watch one anothei The cieam will be no safer
by appointing two or thiee instead of one cat to
walch it
I hive thus briefly presented my remedy foi
pievailmg evils I have had it before this House,
in the shipe ot resolutions to amend the Consti-
tution foi yiars, but have had no opportunity to
discuss it I have now only glanced at the rea-
sons in its favoi The known political character
of tin House, and the certain lejectiou of the
" lefoun" I propose, have reconciled me in some
measure to the neglect, or rather the past omis-
sion to eonsidei and discuss the subject But I
trust, sn, there is a day coming, and that it is
not far distant, when my piopositions will receive
the deliberate attention of Congress and of the
nation I look to the success ot the Whig cause
as essential to secuie the desned, the real " re-
Jonn " I hope and believe, if the Whigs ever
come in o powei ,tney will apply the piopei rem-
edy to the diseases which afflict us If I could
foiesee events, and m my vision of the futuie
behold the Whigs seated in power, and then wit-
j ness a faithless non complnnce wnh their pledges
!| and piomises to the cojnti v, as faithless as that
of the list Adimmstrition, I should mourn over
I then coming disgtace, and it pent of myeffoits,
humble as they ait, to eltv Ue men who, like
tlitn pi edtctssois,fir^ct their pi oft «sionsas soot
as they get powei If we i e destined to <-ee one
