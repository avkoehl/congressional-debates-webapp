General BRAGG,

Expedite the organization of furloughed prisoners ordered to rendezvous in Tennessee. How many arms will be required? Have you batteries on the commanding heights? Can you attack one of the enemy's columns by a combination of the main body of both yours so as to fight him in detail?
