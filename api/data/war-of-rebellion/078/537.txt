Ridge road, leading to Decherd. He saw nothing of a party sent out by General Milroy of twenty-five men on the road he traveled. If Forrest's force is correctly reported, he has evidently detached a portion of his command for service elsewhere. A scouting party has been ordered out from Decherd this evening.

TULLAHOMA, September 30, 1864-7 p. m.

General THOMAS:

Captain Bissell, Twelfth Indiana Cavalry, is just in from Lynchburg; reports Forrest not there. Was informed by citizens that he returned this morning the way he came, and is certain he did not go the Chestnut Ridge road, toward Decherd, as he traveled that road two or three miles. He went out the main Lynchburg road until within two miles of Lynchburg, where he turned off south, and fell in with the Chestnut Ridge road and went into Lynchburg on that; hence, perhaps, the boy referred to in my last did not see or hear of him.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

TULLAHOMA, September 30, 1864.

General THOMAS:

The following dispatch just received from General Croxton, at 7 this p. m., 30th:

GENERAL: A scouting party sent out by me reported a rebel force, estimated at 7,000, encamped last night on Chestnut Ridge, half way between Lynchburg and Elk River, on the Winchester road. Whither they went, or whether they moved at all, they did not discover. I have sent scout to determine these questions.

JNO T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General.

TULLAHOMA, September 30, 1864-8. 30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Had not some of the troops from Kentucky, referred to by Major Polk, better be sent to Johnsonville and Reynoldsburg? Have ordered scouts to the Lynchburg and Shelbyville road, six miles from Normandy, to see if Forrest took that. Shall send scout from Lynchburg, and also from Murfreesborough to-night, to ascertain what road Forrest took. What else shall I do?

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, September 30, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU, Tullahoma:

Send the main body of the Kentucky troops to Murfreesborough when they arrive, detaching sufficient numbers to guard block-houses on the line from Mill Creek to Wartrace, inclusive. Telegraph General Starkweather to be firm and cool and not to become stampeded.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
