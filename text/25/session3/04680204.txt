Interference in Elections—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
his fan fame In mercy to him I would not re-
move any of them Let h m have a chance for
his life He has dared to make a leport against
the hill m its original form, as it was ief< rred to
the committee of which he is the chauimn, and
for this cause has encountered all the withering
denunciations of the Senators from Kentucky and
Vngima, [Messis Crittendci  and Rives ] In
justice to him, the aspect of the question should
not now be changed Let us, ihen, have the
bill, the whole bill, and nothing but the bill,
against which his íeport was directed
It would seem almost unnecessaiy to discuss
the question whethei this bill be constitutional ot
not, as the Senatot fiom Kentucky, throughout
the whole course of Ins argument, never once at
tempted to point to any clause of the Constitu-
tion on which it could be supported It is tiuo
that he did cite some precedents in our legisla
tion which he supposes to have a beaung on the
subject, but which, I shall undeitake to prove
heieaftei, are wholly inapplicable The Senator
fiom Virginia [Mr line] hasgone further into
the argument, and his attempted to prove that
this bill is constitutional At the piopcr time 1
shall endeavor to furnish the proper answer to
Ins remaiks By the by, this Constitution is a
temblé bugbear Whilst a membci of the othei
House, I once heaid an old gentleman exclaim,
when it was cited against oneof hisfavoute meas-
ures, " what a vast deal of good it prevents, us
from doing'" After this bill shall have passed it
will be a bugucat no longci, so furas the fiee
dom of spied) or of the pi ess is concerned It
will not liitn alarm even political childien
The gentlemen have a precedent foi their bill
Yts, sn, they have a precedent in the sedition
law, but it does not go fai enough foi their pur-
pose   That law, which is the only tiue precedent
on which this bill can be founded, and on which
atone u can be sustained, permuted cvciy man to
wute and to publish what he pleased concerning
public men and public measuics, and only held
lnm lesponsiblc in case his charges should piove
to be false     But this, bill is a gag law     It goes
to the fountain at once, and piohibits the offiooi
not only fiom wilting, but tinm spiaking any-
thing good, bad, 01 nidiflirent, whether tiue 01
lalse, on any subject whaicvei whn h may a(l< ft
nny pending election, fiom that of a Picsidcnt
down to a constable     It has a much brondi i
sweep than the sedition law, whn h did not inte i
feto with the hbcity of speech, howevei much it
may have «budged  the  freedom of the  pi ess   I
Indeed, among tin  moie enhghtintd despotisms .
of Luiopc, I know not on< which piohibits tin  '
fieedom ol bpeiehon all public subjects, it is only
in fice and enlightened Ann nca that we pioposc
actually to insett the gag   The sedition liw was
bad enough, God lviiows, but it extendi d only |
to the use of the pen, not to th it of the tongue
Them is, theiefoic, no parallel between the two I
cases                                                                               I
Had it not been for the existence of the sedi-
tion law, I should have supposed it to be impos
sible tint there could have been two o| uuons m
regaid to tin uttei unconstitutionality of this bill
Mhc Constitution, in language so plain as to have
no room for miseonstiuction,declines that "Con-
gress shall make no law abridging the ficcdom of
speech or of the piess "   The rule is umvcisal
rhcie is no exception    Tins bill pioposcs not
only to abridge, but uttetly to desttoy the free-
dom of speech and of the press, to inteidict their
use altogether to the enumeiatcd officeis, on all
questions touching the election of any ofhcei of
the Fedeial 01 State Government     A plain man
would naturally suppose that, baiely to st ite the
contradiction between the Constitution and this
bill was to decide the question     Notso     An in-
genious and astute lawyer, in favor of a liberal
construction of that instrument, can,  by infu
ence and ingenuity, confei  powers upon Con
giess in direct vioiuion both of Us letter and Us
spint,   and   ot   which   Us   framcrs   nevei   once
Jicamcd      Sjch wis the po vci to pas'? the sedi

tion any law which might be passed to punish
libels against the Piesidcnt, the Government, or
either House of Congress The piesent bill, in
principle at least, piocccds much further It ex-
cepts fiom the geneial pioluoition of the Consti-
tution the power of punishing all persons ho ding
offices undei the Government of the United States
who shall date either to speak oi to write at all
on questions which may affect the ltsult of any
election This interpolation must be inserted,
before gentlemen can show any powei to pass the
ptc sent bill Thry cannot advance one step m
thciraigumcnt without it This Constitution can
never be construed accoiding to the meaning of
its frameis but by men of plain, well informed,
and piactical judgment Common sense is its
best expounder Ingenious men disposed to
laise one implication upon another in favor of
Federal powci, and to make each pievious pre
cedent the foundation on which to pioceed an
other step in the maich towaids consolidation,
may soon make it mean anything ot nothing
The liberties of this countiycan only be pre
served by a stwet construction of the enumerated
powers gianted by the States to Congress
Before Iprocc ed furthei in my argument against
the constitutionality of tint, bill, it will he proper
that I should d velop some of its htent beauties
I desne to delineate a little moie piecisely its
charactei—to pi esent some of its sinking features,
and to show what it is in pi maple, and what it
will pi ove to be in piactiee
There aie twenty six s>veictgn States in this
Confederacy, unite d by a Podeial compact, called
the Constitution of the United States Each in
dividual elector in this country sustains two dis-
tinct characters He is a citizen of some one of
the States, and he is also a citizen of the United
States He is bound to pi rfoim the duties of a
good citizen both towaids his own State and to-
waids the Ututt d States Now, what does this
bill propose ' In the older States of this Confi d-
eiacy, all the Tcdeial officeis wliieh we have in
the interior aie postmasters It is tiue that at
our poits of entry thcio are custom house officers
but in Pennsylvania foi example, fiom tin
Schuylkill to the Ohio and to Lak Liu, out
people scaucly feel then connection with the
Gtni ral Government, except through the mi dium
ol the Post Ónice Department J. hese postmas
tus aie vi ty numeiotis They aie plinted at
et cry village and at eiciy cioss load Ihcy ue
agents for dissemin Uing information thiouDhout
tin countiy I might piobably say that in nine
nistauoi s t ut of ten the oilice is seaicely woi th
holding, on act ount of Us pecuniary emoluments
In mosteai.es, the postmaster accepts it for the
accommodation of his neighbois Now, this
postulaste i is generally a man of pioperty and of
clmactcr, h ivuig a deep stake in the community,
and in the futhful admim¡,tiation and execution
of the 1 iws Two candidates are picsented to
the people foi office, say that of a justice of the
peace
If one of those village postmasters should, in
the cxeicise of his unquestionable rights as aciti
yen of Pi nnsylvania, advise his neighbor to vote
foi one of these candidates, and against the othei,
this lull dooms him to afine of ^500, and to a per-
petual disqualification fiom evei holding any office
undei the Government of the Uniti d States No
mattei whethei the incuts which ho may have
ascnbcd to one of the candidates be true as Holy
Wnt, and the delinquencies which he may have
charged against the other may be susceptible of
the cleaiest proof, this will not arrest the von
gcance ofthebill He is doomed to remain mute,
although his dearest interests may be involved,
oi incur its penalties A gag is to be put into his
mouth, and he is to be punished if he dare to ex-
piess a piefeience for one candidate over the
othei And let me tell the gentleman, these post-
mastcis hold all sons of political opinions In my
own State aconsideiablepiopoition of then num-
bei aie Whigs and Antimasons, opposed to the
piesent Admimstiation I might cite other ex
imples to uepict the enormity of this bill, but I
consider it wholly unneeescaiy I mightascend
fiom the justice of the peace oi the constable,
th ough all the giadations of electnc office, State
and Pederá!, to the Pi esident of the United States,
and show that, at each ascending giade, the vio-
lation of the rights of the citizen becomes more
and more outrageous I might enumerate the
weighersand thegaugeis, and the othei proscribed
classes of inferior office-holders, and paint the
mad and wanton injustice which tluu bill would
inflict upon them     But enough
The man who would accept office upon such
terms must forfeit all self íespect, and would be-
come at once a fit tool for coiruption and for des-
potism He must be dcgiaded in his o\\ n eyes,
and degraded in the eyes of his fellow cuizens
below the rank of a freeman If you desne to
depreciate the Government itself under which we
li'f, you cannot do it more fffprtually than by
placing such a stigma on its officeis
Why, sir, you could not, by any possibility,
cairy such a law into execution     It it should
pass to monow, it would fall a dead letter upon
j youi statute book     I would notadvocatea forci-
I ble resistance to aiy law, and do not believe
that such was  the  intention of my fncnd from
New Jersey, [Mr  Will,] when  he spoke  of
íesistance, but does not the Senator fiom Vir-
ginia know that laws may be passed of a char-
actei  so odious that nobody could  be found to
! cairy them into execution'   Such aie all laws
I which are entnely opposed to the spmt of the
j age, and the united and oveiwhelming ennent of
public opinion     I firmly believe tins to be the
I character of the piesent bill
| But suppose mo to be mistaken in this opinion,
and that the law could be earned into execution,
what would be the consequences' The doomed
ollicer, the postmaster, the weigher, or the gauger,
is placed in the midst of a thinking, acting, busy
population Eveiytlung around lnm is pioceed-
nig with the impetuosity of steam Public opinion
is marching onwaid with giant strides The offi-
cer is talked at and talked to, daily and hourly,
by the sui rounding multitude, whilst the law
compels him to close his lips in silence Under
such encumstances, it would be impossible for
human natuie long to lcfram What then' If
he uttcis a syllable on any of the exciting polit-
ical topics of the day, and these aie all involved
in the pcipetual canvass which is pioceeding for
l' ofliec s, high and low, he is at once seized upon
by some haipy of an informei Uus bill offeis a
most tempting bnbe to such eavesdioppers It
would soon c ill into existence such a íace, to dog
and sunound eve ry oflicer, and to catch up every
incautious woid which might be constiued into
an c ndeavoi to pcisuade oi dissuade an clectoi
Pieh individual in society is stimulated by this
bill to become a common infoimer, by the tempt-
ing olí i of abnbe of J2)0ineach paitieulat case
The prosciibcd ofTicei thus becomes his prey,
and, in most cases, will be glad ti compiomise
with him foi the payment of a gieat part, or the
whole, of the penalty of s500, in order to avoid
the stigma of perpetual disability to hold any
ofliee undei this Government
Theieis anothoi icmaik which I desire to make
on this bianch of the subj ct Whenever you
attempt to violate the pi un letter and spuit of the
Constitution^ thousand evils, of which you have
nevei dieamed, piesent themselves in the pei-
spective This law can alone be executed by the
couits of the United States Where are they
situated' In the laige States, such as Pennsyl-
vania or Virginia, they aie held at gieat dis-
tances fiom each other A postmaster in either
of these States, the income of v. hose office does
not exceed fifty dollars per annum, may be
dragged fiom home, a distance of one hundied
and fifty or two hundred miles, to stand his ti ml
undei this bill befoie a Federal couit The ex-
pense would be enormous, whilst he is obliged
to appear before a tnbunal far from the place
where his chaiacter and that of his prosecutor,
are known and appieciated Undei such circum-
stances, he would almost be certain to become
the 'victim of the common informer, under this
most unjust and unconstitutional law He would
cither be com icted, or compelled to buy his peace
at almost any price
In conferring the powers enumeiated in the
Constitution on the Federal Government, the
States expressly reseived to themselves respect-
ively, or to their people, all the poweis not dele-
gated by it to the Un ted States, or prohibited by
it to the States Now I would ask the Senator
from Kentucky when, or where, or how, has-the-
