SMITH'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 12, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT;

The truck of the 13-inch mortar broke down last night at fifth discharge. If you will send up another truck with two screw-jacks we will shift the mortar and try to rebuild the old truck or wait orders. Lieutenant Hall has just been killed by a sharpshooter. I shall try and make arrangements to send body home.

Major
