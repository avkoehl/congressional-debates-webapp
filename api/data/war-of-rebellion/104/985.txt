Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

The six steamers mentioned in your telegram some time ago as having been ordered to report to me in Mobile Bay have not as yet arrived and nothing has been heard of them. Are they coming? The propeller steamers of the East Steamship Company would be very suitable for the navigation on the Gulf coast. Can any of them be sent?
