Public Defaulters—Mr. Duncan.
Ho. of Reps.
any other member, I repeat the challenge—ím-
Feach Secretary Woodbury if you dare. But,sir,
proceed to sustain my plea, and the assertions I
have dared to make m defense of this Administra-
tion, by facts and matters of record But, first,
let «re call the attention of those who hear me, and
those who may read me, that the President nom-
inates all receiving, collecting, and disbursing offi-
cers; those who are the defaulters were nominated
by the President and confirmed by the Senate
Mr Woodbury has no control over thoseappomt-
rnents. if unprincipled men get into office, and
the Government is defrauded thereby, it is unjust
and unfair to hold the Secretary of the Treasury
responsible, responsible for the conduct of officers
not of his appointing, and over whose conduct
he has no control, except to detect them after a
frauá has been committed, and to recommend their
removal from office Whatevei moral or political
«vil may attach to the appointment of a fiaudulent
officer, nominated by the President and confiimed
by the Senate, neither the President nor the Sec
Tetary of the Treasury ought to be held responsi-
ble; for, as I said, the Secietary has no absolute
control over the appointment, and the President
cannot be presumed to be acquainted with the
Merits, morals, integrity, and qualifications of the
hundredth individual who is appointed to office,
■Who may have a portion of the control of the
fmblic revenue He must rely upon the recom-
mendation of those who are acquainted with (he
applicant, and upon the Senate, who confnni his
nominations, and who have fifty times the oppoi-
tunity to know the qualifications of the nominees
that the President has, their body consisting of
that number, and their practical acquaintance co-
extensive with the Union
But f said that this wa-jan economical Admin-
istration Sii, I refer you to the messages of the
President and the reports of the Secietary of the
Treasury One of the principal features in each
is a strong recommendation of economy in the
expenditures of the Government What is it, sir,
thai constitutes exuavagance in om Government'
It is the appropriation of money for purposes
named in the act of appiopnation beyond the
amount of theGovernment estimates 1 he Secie-
tary of the Tieasury presents C ingress with rev-
enue estimates Now what does extravagaroe
consist in > Why, m appropriating money beyond
the amount of the estimates, and beyond the
amount of the income of the Government and her
ability to pay Who makes the appropriations
Why, Congress I hen, sir, when we have lirge
and e\:trav(j;ant Government expéndanles, by
which the peopleaieoppressively taxed, who is to
blame' Congress, and I hesitate rot to say (and
1 challenge an examination of the Journals) that,
nine times m ten the extravagant appiopnations
have been biought forward, sustained, and car-
ried by a nwjoiity of the Federal niembeio of
Congress Yes, sir, by the very men who cry
exuavagance loudest
But, sir, I said that more than two thuds of the
Government defaulters were opposed to the Demo
cratic patty, &a     Sit, I hold in my hand a book
con aming the evidence of what 1 say—<i  list of
public defaulteis from the commencement of the
Government until the time it was reported, 18¿i3
It contains the names, Í think, of upwauls of thiee
thousand public defaulters     i am not icq united
with the politics of there, but 1 think 1 ri k noth-
ing in saying that rnoie than two thuds aie, and
have been, opposed to the Democratic  party      I
fudge of those I do not know by thos  i do know
J do not, in general, mean peisonal acquaintance
I say, as I have done, that defalcations tre numer
oils, thev have existed from the commencement
of the Government, and  they will continue  to
exist wl ile theGovernment existe, and while frail
man continues to administer it     It is contrary to
human nature and to ail  numan experience to
sup-ose that tms vast political fabric «hou d  be
rr ana<-ed m all us v uious and comphcaied inter
ests and  du íes without atusas   and alt thit Ccin
be d  ne O secure J e Government and the pepp e
fion cuch abuses and  fraud" as haie been plac-
ing ], s id   to p ovide again  t stlb eqaent abuses,
is t    i   move the ci ¡ses Lhst 1 ave exis'pd, and to
es fib f* i sut h cdditi it al cl eckb as w ll be most
like y to secuiea faithful and honest aairimstra
tion of the Government m all ¡ts parts, t,t least,
so far as human weakness, frailty, and temptation
will permit I think these will be paramount
duties to idle declamation, and that unlimited
pouring forth of bitter vituperation and unquali-
fied abuse for party purposes and President-
making.
In íelation to the defalcations in financial trusts,
the causes seem to have had their origin and exist-
ence, io part, in the banking system, and the con-
nection of the Government with the banks It
seems to me this must be conceded by all who
have honestly investigated the subject Why,
then, do those who are opposed to this Adminis-
tration, denounce it in such unqualified terms, as
the cause of all the abuses now presented by the
official reports of defalcations, as well of this Ad-
ministration and the defaulters under it, as those
which have gone before it, for which it is neither
morally nor politically responsible' Sir, we can
retort I ask, who was it that introduced the
banking system into this country in a national
sense' Alexander Hamilton Who was he'
One of the leaders of the Federal paity What
party is it, and what party has it been, by which
it has been kept up' The Federal party To
what paity has the principal defaulteis belonged'
To the Federal paity 1 say, under what Ad-
ministrations have the gieatest amount of defalca-
tions occurred' JNot this, noi the one that pre-
ceded it Su, 1 propose now to expose the names
of some of those who belong to the party who are
now ciymgeoiruption, corruption, so loud and so
long, in concord wnh the cry of panic, panic,
with which we have been so long grated And,
sn, if 1 should open the tombs, bieak down the
ramparts of ancient grave yards, and dig, hyena-
like, into the grave, and disrobe thedead,! hope I
will find an ample apology in the pat amount law of
self defense It was not I who began this exposi-
tion Should any man's feelings heie or else-
where be hurt, the blame must not be laid on me,
but upon those who have wantonly pi ovoked it
The first name, then, sir, I will present, is that
of one John Adams, once a Piesident ot these
United State* He, sn, stand" upon the records
of this Goveinnent as a defaultei to the amount
of ^12,898 The h story of this defalcation is
undeistood to be, tint a sum of money was ap-
piopriated for furnishing the President's house
PifSidcM Adams diew the cash in advance He
employed this amount in purchasing a splendid
carnage and horses, and othei personal accommo-
dations This the accounting officers could not
allow lie refused to reimbuise the money
1 lus amount, thetefo'e, remains unsettled to this
day, und will until the last day                                 [

the records show to be the perpetrators These
frauds, with the names of those who eomm.tted
them, are matters of íecord, and the facts are
spread over the vhole country, and known to all
who read the Journals of Congress and the re-
ports of the Secretary of the J reasury Conse-
quently, my exposition can neither affect the rep-
utation of those whose names I expose or the
cause of justice
Mr King, late collector of Bath, Maine, seems
to be a defaulter for the mode-it sum of $15,000
Perhaps the gentleman now in my eye, [Mr
Evans,] can tell us what that gentleman's politics
are, and whether he was not the late Whig can-
didate for Governor of that State, and whether,
with all the corruptions of defalcation in which
he is involved, he did not receive the entire Whig
vote of his State
So we ride—but again-
Joseph Wingate and J S Sxoanton, late collectors
at Bath also I have not before me the amount
of their defalcations, but they are defaulters, and
the former, since his defalcation,has been a Whig
member of Congress, and most lovingly embraced
by the whole party The latter, for his violent
abuse of Democratic principles, has been rewarded
by the late Federal Governor of Maine, with a
lesponsible office, the functions of which requvie a
pellicular supervision of the finances of the county of
Kennebecl 1 ask an examination of the reports
It will be found that the collectois, receiveis, and
disbuising agents, all, or nearly all, support the
views which are now advanced with so much zeal
foi the entire indemnity of this system of fraud
and plunder Examine No 191, made to the
House of Representatives, February 28, 1838
The loss by banks estimated at about ^6,000,000,
then nominal debt was nearly double, but partly
secured This amount is exclusive of interest,
¡ with interest, it will be near $30,000,000 1 refer
I to the report to the Senate, February 2, 1838,
Document No  158
j     The losses prior to General Jackson's admin-
I istration, by collectors and  lectivets, amount to
1 $1,200,000  the nominal sum is nearly double, but
pait of this sum is secuied     It is probable noth-
ing will be lost eventually under General Jack
"oil's administration but by Littlebury Hawkins, or
under the present Administration but by Swart-
loout and Puce    There will be other defaulters,
but then security will be good for their respective
amounts
Reckless, collector at Perth Amboy, has produced
some alarm, his defalcation was thirty or fifty
dollars He, so soon as the defalcation was di«-
coveicd,paid the amount He was a Democrat
He was muled by his predecessor
But do we hear anything fiom Jlinold, the col-
lector of the same place, some years before, under
the administration of one John Q. Adams' He
is in default for $80 000, not one farthing of which
was leoovered, yet we hear no Federal murmuring
about that defalcation He was a modern Whig
This was caused by the neglect of the Administra-
tion undei which the default occuned, accoidins
to the charges now prefe led, and it was und r
the bank odrninistrati >n Why this muteness
about Arnold's defalcation '    All understood
The loss on merchants' bonds This loss
amounted to $7,000,000, without interest See
detail ot names and dates in report to Senate, 6 h,
July, 1838, document No 503 There will be
found the name of G W liruen, of the fi-m of
Thomas Smith & Co , in default for the modest
sum of $800,000 I would like to know wbethei
or not he is a violent and noisy Whig m New
Yoik Peihaps the Whig gentleman now in my
eye [Mr Curtis] can inform me And 1 would
inquire of that gentleman, if he did not make the
motion in common council to dismiss all Demo-
ciats in the city from office and public employ,
even down to the lamplighters'
Edwmd Thompson, I think, of Philadelphia,
whom the iecoids show to be a defaulter to a
considerable amount, say the teasonabU sum of
4,700,000, or more Perhaps some of the Whig
gentleman fioin that city can inforn t s as to his
politics Whg, I piesume' Yes, silence gives
con^nt
All thes-base frauds an 1 wholesale d falcat ons
occurred undei the United States Bt.nk Admims-
travion, and before the piesent Administration.
