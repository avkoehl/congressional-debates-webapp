Brigadier-General CROOK,

Commanding Kanawha Division:

I did not reach Covington, as General Jenkins' and Colonel Dunn's forces were both before me. Near Williamsburg I captured a train of 7 wagons, and arrived here on the 11th instant with 23 horses, 4 mules, and 9 prisoners. I destroyed the wagons, with a quantity of grain. I have sent to you a detailed account of the expedition.

It is reported that Dahlgren is about going on another raid to Fredericksburg. You had better direct General Sigel to stop this, or it may interfere with your purposes. Look out for a cavalry raid to cut off your supplies.
