veto of the Banfc of* the United States? In the case of the
Waysvijle road? In the case of the two bank charters of the
last extra, session? Notan instance has been adduced ra which
the people have condemned the use of the veto power But if
the Executive had become so powerfully the veto, where was
the fact that, according to the Senator from Virginia, the pie
seat President could not command a single vote here, or among
the people, and only half a dozen m the other House? Where
•was the factthat General Jackson, with all hié formidable fame,
could not carry an election in his own district? Millions of
hearts venerate and love him, and millions of bayonets would
defend him from wrong, but to influence one vote improperly,
he could not if he would, and would not if he could
In Prance, the experience of forty years has resulted m the
veto power being made absolute in the king What brought
Louis XVI to the block? Was it not the legislative power t
"Wnat brought Charles I to the block? The legislative power
He could not bring the legislative power to the block
The Senator from Kentucky, by referring to the history of
the veto power m France, dues not mean that such results as
followed there could follow here, but does he not see that it
was the usurpation of the legislative power over the veto
power—first modifying it and then abolishing it—which drag-
ged the Executive to the guillotine, and covered the beauty, ta
lent and religion of Prance with blood and desolation?
Patrick Henry, instead of complaining of this Government
ceing too much checked, was of opinion it was not checked
enough—so Mr Jefferson—m proof of which Mr W read
passages from their recorded opm ons
The facts are aii against the propriety of interfering with the
veto power
He trusted that no attempt to meddle with that sacred instru
ment, the Constitution of the United States, would be sane
ttoned by any vote of the Senate    It was oui political Bible

riie Hou**e resumed the consideration of the report of the 5 h

pointed on the 17th June, 1841, in relation to the number desig
nation, and duties of the officers and Attendants upon the House
of Representative0, and to the contingent expenses of the
House
The first lesolution íepor ed by the committee is as fol-
lows
Resolver? That the Clei k of the House be, and he is hei eby,
authorized to continue in his ofhc the services of the tin ee as
sistant rleiks au horized by resolutions adopted bytheHou^e
on the 6th day of March 1826, and the 11th day of October,
1837, m addition to the six assistant cleik5* now authouzedby
law, at the annual salary now recen ed by them, íespectively,
and that he emj loy no greater nun ber of ai^tint cler'i^ at any
time in his office unless permitted so to do by an or ]er or reso
iution of the House
Which said íe^olution Mr Gordon had moved ti amend
by substituting therefor the following modified su siutefpro
position
"And, in addition thereto, that he be authorize 1 to coi tinue
the two assistant clerks njw employed m his office, and who
have been employed therein since 1838 "
And the question being on the amendment as modified—
Mr SAL ION-TALL addressed the House at some length
m favot of the amendment
Mr BRIGG8 tJdressed the House in opposition to it
Mr PICKENS said m this particular case he was disposed
to leaye much to the discretion of the committee, but as to the I
general scope and principles embraced in the resolution, they
had his cordial approval, and he was glad that the committee
had commenced the work of reform It was due to the coun-
try, and it was dut- to their own position, if they intended to
effect reforms, that they should commence the work of reform
amongst themselves Tl is be conceived to be due to the coun-
try, as well as j;o their own moral standing and influence in the
House, aod he hoped the committee had reported this resolu-
tion with ajudicious regaid to detads He was aware that this
House had lost much of its influence, but he differed fiom other
gentlemen íespecting the cause Much might be attributed to
the system pursued by whirh they permitted caucusesout of
that House to control their judgments, which should be indepen-
dent within it
Again he desired the temoval of those desks which were an
interruption to sound legislation This was a reform which he
hoped the committee would consider Let the members be
brought closer together, let them see each other face to face;
let their debates be practical, let (hem analyze the subjects un-
der discussion on fair principles, and let them not have those
miserable desks which were only fit iof lazy loungers, and
which were adverse to sound legislation He believed ihis
would be a practical reform, and he again hoped the com-
mittee would take it into consideration, tor m fact it would re-
form their expenditures, and m five yeais' operation he believed
it would reduce them one third It would shorten the sessions,
and thus lessen their expenditures Theie was another reform
which he deemed highly essential It was intended that this
branch of the Government should be co ordinate and
independent—really and in fact independent and a check on
t\ e other branches This was the intention of the framers of
the Constitution He would not say that this House had fallen
from its high estate, but be believed if any thing tended to that
state of things it was then present system Abolish their mile-
age, abolish ext) asm eveiy shape, abolish the flanking privi-
lege except of pubhedocuments, let each man pay Ins own
expenses and have a fixed compei sauon, and he believed this
would reform their legislati&n, foi it. w uld teduce the sessions
at least one half And he did not wish them to pay a mise
rabie compensation that would make the members dependent on
the Executive, he denned them to pay a compensation compati
ble with thegemusofthecountry and such as would make this,
as it was intended to be a co ordinate branchy of the
Government, by placing them above dependence on the patron,
ageofthe Executive This would be aradical ieform, which
would do much towards preseiving the purity of the House
It was their present miserable standard it was their unfair
system of mileage which tended to degrade the House Make
the compensation such as would place the members in a posi
tion of independence, so that they could in fact be the guardi
ans of the Constitution inda check oi the expenditures of the
Government, a& i was intended that they should be Make
the compensation such that the pooitst member of the commu
nity who mi£,ht peihapb be s gnally useful might represent a
constituency, but the piesent <;y=tem of miserable com
pensation excludes the pool, though active and ta-
lented, and confines them to the laborious pur
buits of lile But make them m'ependent, and give
them the control winch the fiamei  of the Constitution in
tended they should have, and they would enable the poorest
citizen m society to take his seat then1, and be the Representa-
tive of the freemen of his countiy He recollected that a gen-
tleman of his own State, who wa<3 one of me fiamers of the
Constitution proposed that the membeie of the Senate should
íeceive no compensation at all but what would have been the
result? Why, perhaps nothah a dozen representatives of the
States m this Confederacy could have taken their seats at all,
they eould not have sacrificed the irterests of their farm
lies If they must give themselves up to the service
of the country, they must have such a compensation
as would jubtify them m doing so, and in sacrificing
the interests of their families And what was of far
more importance, they must keep this branch of the Govern-
ment independent of the Executive and abo* e the miserable and
contemptible glitter and corruption which ,was brought on
many occasions to influence this House Indroduce these radi-
cal measures and hey should have his co operation He
would not idmimster to the depraved appetite of the day he
held a demagogue who would favor and flatlet a people with
the idea of reducing salaries, as striking a vital blow at the in-
dependence of this branchol theGovernmen andattht vital
pimcipleof aRepubltcar Coverrment which intended that the
agert of the people should receive pay equal to the
menial hireling of the Executive Again, let this
House do another thing Inttead of electing a Speaker
undei patty tiammelsand control, letthem elect one whe shall
be eninoit for his talents and his virtues and who wih admi-
nister his office for the honoi of the Houbt without reference to
the dictation of any man or set of men Put a man there who
has talent and firmness ol charactei io do his duty to the House,
and to the country, and to the Confeti tut ion, and remove those
desks—bring the members clo^ei together, eye to eye, and face
to face, so tha they could have a practical analysis of debate,
irdthey woull ieform that House, and the expenditures of
that House Abolish too then fctanoingCommi tee*, which
