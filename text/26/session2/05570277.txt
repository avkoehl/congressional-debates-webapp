Mr Chairman, the clock warns me hat I ha-re
but a lew moment remaining. I regret to be thus
circumscribed, although I voluntarily imponte1 a
limit upon myself, in orde1" that 1 might not inter
fere with the wishes o! other memoers I regret
that it is not in my power to 'a,, before thu House
some other facts that a«em my possession
[Mr Crary here rose and «aid that tn gent'e
man fiom Kentucky (Mr Tripl&tt) h d sta ed
that a du y ot 40 p i cent was laid upon wh «t in
England He (Mi C ) « shed to know by who'
rule the «entleman arrived at that conclusion]
Mr Triplítt By reference to doeu me ts trom
the Departments Tne tariff ot Great Britain on
• wheat and fluur rises and falls wi b the puces or
those articles m tha* country The object, as ap-
paicnt from the law, is to keep the price of wbiat
at 72 shillings per quarter, as it use  above that
price, the tariff is reduced, as it falls below it, the
tariff is increased, indeed, the tariff is varied al-
most every month, therefoie, to come to any cor-
rect conclusion, you must take a series of months—
say 12 months For a series ot three years he
average duty m Esgland upon wneat imported from
America was about 40 per cent, sometimes 't
rises to 60 or 70 per cei t, sometimes it falls as low
as ten, >ometimeo as low as one shilling per quar
ter—but can never get lower Buttheir tariff upon
tobacco is a continuing and abiding oppression,
without modification, wi hout relief or the prosp°c 
of relief I call upon this House, I cad upon this
country, to say whe her wiien the íevision of ihe
tariff laws shall take place, 'his evil shall not b^
looked into We have borne our burdens wito a
patience which would have dorehonor to Job him
self, and, practised as he was in that virtue, Í be-
lieve, if h« had been a tobacco planter, he would
not have submitted a* long as we have done
Mr Chairman, I thank the committee for the pa-
tient hearing they have given me on this occasion
I see that there are mary other gentlemen anxious
to obtain the floor, and I will therefore yield it
now It is probab'e that I may avail myself ot
some future occa ion to add something to the re-
marks I have already submitted on ihis most inte-
resting topic
SPEECH OF MR  BRACKENRIDGE
OF PENNSYLVANIA
House of Representatives, February 3, 1841—On the
bill providing for the issue of Treasury Notes
Mr Chairman Nope son can feel less des.re
than I do to throw difficulty in the way of the pre
sent Administration, in providing the means foi
carrying on the Government during the piesent
year. A very small portion of that time, however,
belongs to it, and it wdl not require any great
amount of money to enaole it to retire with decen-
cy, no matter what may become ot the admini-
stration which will follow But, sir, I have very
serious objections to the mode of raising money
proposed by this bill The manner of doing a thing
may be morp important than the th ng itself I
regret, therefore, that t is not in my power to vo*e
for the bill on your table.
In the first place, I cannot, consistently with the
opinions I have heretofore expressed, vote for the
issue of Treasury notes under the present circum-
stances They are in trath a loan, a debt, and yet
they do not profess to be so. They are not only
loans, but loans in the worst ioim, even it th y
7i easury Note Bill—Mr. Brackenriclge.

tion which they have so decid< dlv mannenei Sup-
pose, sir, that the minister of a European monarch

be visited by the just di pi asur^ of the c ien'kd
sovereign. Heie tie people aie swer ign, and
have a right to know the truth, and ti e exaU

Secretary in his report, documents intended for the
widest circulation, till one story, and immediately
af er, as if for the private ear of this House, and
cut oí heanrg of the peopk, tie S^cre ary comes
and tells a \etv differcu siory Ws art. told, in a
tide whi per, that the JTreasuiv is empty, and ihat
an issu ot Treasury notes to th  arroun oi five
millions is absolutely nece*«ary to meet the dc
mands on it d n ng the Jirsf quarter of the year
After tha*, money wil' come iu plentifully, am, it
it di es not, to them it will be a mati r of mdiffe-
íeuce, as by that ame thsy « l1 lave been re evel
from the cares and anxieties of State affair
Thi* stoiy of five mil ions ot lie sury note  fu
the first quarter has now been regu'ariy repeaie '
tor the last three sessions So tearful was the Se-
cretary oi d scbsing the real natuie of th s riemvi i,
tnat, in tne first instance, it was m'tnuntsiy ra led
the e\rtiangipg the notes of the Gi.eniment for
specie' It was thought that tL a w uld < rve as an
effectual malU  to conceal i s as y and uDpopnkr
H. of Reps.
teatu' s It was not the ceation of a debt, it
was simply procuring specie, by giving for it a
piece ot paper, with a promise to pay written on
t. *\ s u. it paoer any th ng more than evidence

it in rinsK value But these notes are not only
equivalent t> specie, but superior, because they
beai interest' They are not only good bona fide
oread and butter, but have a little sugar sprinkled
ove tLem besides.
Now, ir, I think n proper and necessary that
tne peep e hould know the true situation of their
Treasar Tney shomd at leas' know whether
ihey aic m deot, or free fiom debt. This is ne-
<^« ary, in oider that their Representatives may be
requ rat) retrench expenses-, jf a cain be done
without injary to tar public service, and, if not,
ha suitablt means lis ay be ad opted to procure a
ce tain at d * irficieai supply. Attempts have been
i iadc du i g th s debate to defend th3 Administra-
tion frjin tne cuarge of ex ravaganc , and perhaps
it has be di p oved that tne kst year wa  not quite
as eiiravag> t as the preceding years But it has
been demons ra ed by tne gentleman from Tennes
see, [\!' BeuL ] who has mvestigateu this iubject
\. itli great ab lity, and also by the gentleman from
í vi Yirk [Mr Bírnard ] and the gentleman
from Mame, [Mr Evans,] who have gone into de
'ausand analyzed me Secretary's, report, that the
necessary and usual exdenditures for national de
fences hive ei'her been suspended, or remain a
charge to be met by the new Administration In-
steai of meeting this and explaining it, several
gentlemen on the side oí the Administration have
a tempted t > give an unfair representation of the
ground thus taken They cry out that the Whigs
ar^row for lavish expenditure, and charge the late
Administration with parsimony, while before the
election the charge of extravagance was contmu-
a'ly rung in the ears of the people. This manoeu-
vre is too obvious to deceive ony one. The Whigs
aie consistent—they want no lavish expenditure,
hey want no increase of expense in furnishing the
President's house Gen. Harrison will think it
good enough for him, and I have ho doubt tie
would rejotce it the money wnich was laid out in
its splendid curtains, and golden spoons and dishes,
í ere no'T ir- the Treasury
Ine Whiga go for economy and reform, bu'
have no wi h to see a fal e economy in providing
for He safety aad welfare of our country, for ths
improvement of our navy, the completion of our
¡o tífica i ns, and for national work  undertaken at
tie pubin expense The gent'emaa from New
York, [Mr. Vanderpoel,] who labored so much in
Use de ence of this condemned Administration, re-
ferred, among other items of extraordinary and un-
avoidable expenditure, to our Indian relations I
might refei hi n to the electioneering relations equally
expensive, and equally as fruitless as the Florida
war One thing is undeniable the expenses of
thf Government within the last six years have all
at nice doubled the expenses of the preceding
twenty years, without an) national debt to pay,
w h le at the «me tima there has been a great Re-
duction in the expenditures for national purpo«es
These are facts which are not easily explained
The burden of this explanation lies an the Admi-
nistration A proportional increase in our ex-
penses was to be expected E bat, after making this
a lowan'-e, and for the Florida war and Indian re-
lations, still the increase is to me "perfectly uaac-
c uatable " They have not explained to us why
tne expenses- of the Governmeet under Monroe
and Alans were but twenty-three million , with an
anmvl deot of ten millions to be paid out of this
sum, while under the present and late Administra-
tis they were from thirty to thirty-mne millions,
ai'cr the debt was paid off' The weight of this
explanation 'ay upon the late Administration, it
could not bear it, but was crushed under ¡t, never
■o il^e again, unless in some new form, or some
new combination, which will conceal its identity.
Even at the last se<sion, the ttue character of
these Treasury notes was at empted to be con-
cealed Thny were not a loan, it was said—they
were enly Treasury notes    Instead of being ex-
