THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 13,
Mr LEIGH wished to have both amendments
read, in order that the Senate might see if there
was any essential difference between them
[The amendments were read accordingly ]
Mr LEIGH resumed, by saying that he could
perceive no, or vei y little difference between the
propositions of the Senators from Kentucky and
Georgia, [Mr Clay and Mr King,] if any, it was
trifling, and of the two, he preferred that of the
former gentleman Both, however, came exactly
up to his (Mr L 's) idea of what was wise, politic,
and just, toi the United States, and respectful to-
wards France They had been told by the gen-
tleman fiom Pennsylvania that he wad well satis-
fied the true mode of negotiation with France
would be to indicate distinctly, that unless she did
justice, we would take the matter into our own
hands, and seek that redress which she ought to
giant
Mr BUCHANAN explained There was a
period when negotiation must cease, and one 01
the other a'ternative must be adopted
Mr   LEIGH continued     Then war he to tin
derstand the gentleman, that there was a peaod
in diplomacy, and that that period or crisis had
arrived'   If that be the gentleman's opinion, Mi
L  must beg to differ with mm entirely and abso
luteiy     fie was not prepared, at that  turn , to
adopt the Piesident's piopo&ition, so fai as he liad
heard it, noi did he believe any one was     What,
then, was the mode most likely to accomplish this
object'    Either force must be resoited to, or we
must confide in the justice of the Fiench nation
The last was, in his opinion, the best    Mi   L
was, howevei, for making our expression as al>
solute and dignified at, possible, and not to commit
ourselves by declaring that there was no circum-
stances m which we will not hazard a wai with
Frpnce    On the contrary, he was for piesenung
a bold front
After some further remarks to the same pur
poit, Mr L said he concurred in the sentimentof
the gentleman from Alabama, that it would be
inexpedient to adopt any legislative measure t( at
this time," mark that " at this time," for in that
consisted the mam sum and substance of his affiim-
ative to the pioposition
Mr CALHOUN expressed a hope that the
question would be taken without fuithei discus
sion, and that (he phraseology might be so
amended as to meet the views of eveiy gentle
man, so that the voice ot the Senate, might be
unanimous
Mi KING, of Geoigia, said that to thevanous
suggestions and pioposiuons from different pai ts
of the Chambei, he had only a woid in leply
And that was that he was willing to accept my
modification of the resolution tha would unite a
vote upon the subject He would, howevei,
whilst up, say a word in explanation of the
amendment, and answei some objections which
had been made to n He said in answer to the
Senator from Kentuiky, he would say that he
sdected the one leason as that which sepaiated the
Committee from the Piesident, and not only be-
cause it was that mentioned in the repon, but be-
cause it seemed to include all the rest It had
been said by the honorable Senator truly, that
1 lance had promised to do several things which
she had not perfoimed, besides an eaily assem
bling: o( the Chambeis, some of which might with
equal propriety be lefened to Tiue, but the as-
sembling of the Chambers being m general neces
sary fqr the perform ince of the othei promises,
we weie led to hope that the Chambers being
now eorvened, the perlormance of all her other
promises would follow And he wished fuithei
dis inctly to convey the idea to France, that as the
Chambers had assembled, we expected that they
would do all that was necessary, before the y were
prorogued, to fulfil the execution of the treaty
It was objected, he said, to the language of the
amendment, that we seemed by it pledged to ac-
tion, when further information might be secured
fiom France He had no such intention, and if
such construction were found, he would bewihing
to change the language, and say, " unless fuithei
nformauon from fiance shalljustify legislation "
& He said there was not a Senator m the hall
more unwilling to commit himself 01 the Senate to
specific action on 'his suuject than himseif, but
whilst "he did not wish to commit himself to act,
he did not wish to commit himself not to act, if ac-
tion should be called foi He would not ev en at
this time commit himself to hostile action, if theie
should be another simple refusal by the Chambers
to make the appropriation But he said there
was a large portion of the people of the United
States who thought that France had already treat-
ed us with much indignity,and if there should be
anothei refusal, coupled with an acknowledged in-
sult, he would not say even tnen what should be
done It would be time enough to dec de upon
the mode of action, when action might bethought
necessaiy But for the present he would say} that
the United States were now out of the nursery,
and although, as a nation, we may not have ai-
nved at the years of maturity, we were at least in
a condition to act foi and take care of ourselves
He concluded by saying he had no matetial ob
jection to the modification proposed, if it would
unite both part.es in the vote, and unless some
gentleman objected, he should take it for granted
that there was a geneial acquiescence
Mi CUl'UBLRl rose to explain the differ-
ence, in his own opinion, between the resolution
pioposed by himself and that offered by his co'-
leugue, [Mr King,] í.s amended That lesolu
tion meiely expíeles the opinicn that it is inex-
pedient to pass a law on the sulject at this time
It does not, said Mr C , leave the Senate at lib-
eity to change it- opinion with a change of cir-
cumstances If there be no difference, the gentle-
man fiom Vnginia [Mr Lbkh] can have no
oi jeetion to the amendment lie wished to have
the subject presented in such a form that no one
could olject We should kindle in our own
bosoms, said Mi C , the old American feelings
that produced union amongst us—feelings that
cure all the caneéis of paity strife Whatever dis
sensions may divide usat home, however we may
wrangle with each othei, when the stranger steps
in let us be united, when the contest is with a for-
eigner, we should be one
Mr CLAY TON said that he was not willing to
adopt the amendment proposed by the gentleman
fiom Geoigia, | Mi Gutiibiit,] "that under
present circumstances it is inexpedient " He
should vote for the íesolution as amended by the
chauman of ihe committee, [Mi   Clay ]
Mr CLAY rose again, he sud, not to prolong
the discussion [le wishtd to acknowledge ti e
commendation of the report, made by the hcror-
I able Senatoi, [Mr Buciivna\t] He would not
I nowittempt to defend the eriois mentioned by the
gentleman, but at some futuie time he hoped tobe
able to establish anything advanced in the leport
Mr BUCHANAN said he did not pretend to
measure hnnstlf with the eloquent gentleman fron
Kentucky But he was so well convinced of the
tiuth anil justice of theie_maiks n regaul to tne
lepoit, that hewoull not shrink from a con'est,
even with the distmgi ished Senator himself, íathei
than abandon the opinion he had foimed
Mr 1 ALLMADGL «aid heiejoiced to see the
unammitv which seemed to peí vade the ¡senate on
the subject of our relations with I ranct, and he
was unwilling to 11 tioduce any topics into the dis
cussion at this time, whioh .vouid tend to interrupt
the harmony which seemed to prevail At the
time the íeport was made to the Senate, he took
the opportunity to express h s approbation of
some portions of it, and lis dissent fiom other
poitions He was then of opinion that it were
bettei that the committee should make no r^poit,
and that Congiess should not act on the subject
till further information was rece ved fiom Tian^e,
and that the whole matter be left where it was left
by the Piesidcnt's message He was still of
! opin on thatthat would have been the better course
But the majority of the committee tnouglit othei-
wise The report is before the Sena e, and must
receive that consideration which is due to its im-
portance He wi« rejoiced to see the manifesto
tion of a general disposition to adopt such a course
as should tend to unite all parties on tins question
as it was theie presented Herejo.ced to see that
however much we might differ about our own local
and interna! affans, theie was but one feeling
when the honor of 'he nation was concerned
It was a gratifying spectacle to witness the inter
est manifested by the < itizens, who, on this occa-
sion, crowd thu, Chamoer, and suh more giatny-
mg to believe and know that but one sentiment
pervades the whole It is an Jlmencan feeling, a
feeling which swallows up every other when the
question is between our own and a foreign nation.
No matter what may be our dissensions at home,
the indications given here, this day, assure us that
they cannot be extended abroad Let our motto
be, for our coun ry alvxtys
Mr T said, in dissenting from some portions
of the report, it was his intention, when a proper
occasion presented, to enter fully and at large
upon the discussion of those portions of it He
had supposed that this might be deemed a proper
occasion, and was piepared to enter upon itatthis
time But he was reluctant to do anything to
interrupt the harmony of the Senate on the ím-
poitant and leadng matters of the report Ha
would, therefore, omit what he otherwise would
have said, and leserve for a more fittirg occasion,
if one should oftei, what he intended to have sub-
mitted to the consideration of the Senate at this
time, under a full persuasion that he should be
able to assign satisiaetoiy reasons for his dissent
from the majority of the committee
Mr T said he appioved the resolution under
consideiation, as it had been amended,and should
give it his suppoit He was desirous of leaving
the whole mattei open for the future action of
Congiess, when we should receive information
fiom I ranee to enable us to determine what that
action should be Iheie might be a difference of
opin on as to what measures ought to be adopted,
if Tiance should refuse to do us justice, but, it
was best that each individual Senator, and the
Senate as a body, should be left free to act as
should be deemed most expedient when the time
should arrive, and we should be imperiously
called upon to act He would, therefore, detain
the Senate no longei than briefly to remark upon
the positions contained in the Piesident's message
and in the report of the committee These docu-
ments agree entirely in the important points be-
tween the United States and France They agiee
in the enormity of the aggressions upon the rights
of our citizens, and of the outrages upon our eoin-
| merce, for which indemnity has so long been
sought     They agree in the truitless efforts which
H have been made, for nearly a quaiter of a century,
to obtain redress of  the gnevances of which we
||lave complained m vain They agree as to the
amount of oui claims upon France—that our just
' claims far exceed the sum stipulated to be paid W3
by the tieaty of 1831 I hey sariee, also, that
we will not look behind the treaty for any liquida-
tion of the amount of our demands, other than
I what is contained in the tieaty itself Andabove
all, they agree that the stipulations of the treaty
must ultimately be perfoimed That the idea of
non peiformance on the part of Fiance is utteily
out of the question TI ese aie the important
points to this momentous affair, and it is a matter
of congratulation that or all these, there is no dif
l feience of opinion, as he believed, amongst the
repiesentatives of the American people, and he
trusted no diffeience amongst the people them-
se'ves
The difference, ihen, said Mr T , between the
message and the repoit is, c< mparatively, unim-
portant This d ffeiuic consists, fnil, as to the
Piesident's conclusion from the corresoondence,
that the Tienen Government had engaged to pre-
sent to the new Chamteis, the bill making the
appropimton to carry the tieaty into effect, in
time to enable him to communicate the result to
Congiess, it the commencement oc the present
session second, as to the remedy to be pursued in
case the Chambeis shoui 1 again refuse As to the
first the chairman supposes that if tne French
Minister, when the Secretary of State expressed
to him this expectation of the President, had ex
piessed his assent 1.0 it, then the engagement would
have been complete With all due deference,
said All Tvll^íadge, to the honorable chairman,
he would take leave to say, that if, after the Secre-
tary of State had, thus communicated the Presi-
dent's expectation to the French Minister, and he
did not express his dissent, then the engagement
became binding on the Brench Government, and
should hive been  perfoimed     But, he said, he
1 would not pursue this subj et, as  it was not his
intention, at this time, to di«cus3 it
How, men, does tne matter stand'   The Pres-
