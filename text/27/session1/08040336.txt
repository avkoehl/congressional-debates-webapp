Two elements are necessary to naval power—
sailors and money A navy is an expensive force,
and is only formidable when manned with regu-
larly bred sailors In our case, both of these de-
pend on commerce. Commeice is indispensable to
form a commeicial marine, and that to form a
naval marine, while commerce is with us, if thisbill
should pass, the only source of revenue -A flour
ishmg commerce is, then, m every respect, the basis
of our naval power; and to cripple commerce is to
cripple that power—to paralyze the right arm of
our defence But the imposition of onerous duties
on commerce is the most ceitam way to cripple it
Hence this detestable and mischievous measure,
which surrenders the only other source of revenue,
and throws the whole ¡burden of supporting the
Government exclusively on commerce, aims a dead-
ly blow at the vitals ol our power.
The fatal effect of high duties on commerce is
no longer a matter of sppcnlatio i The country
has passed recently through two periods—one of
protective tariff* and high duties, and the other of
reduction oí duties; and we have the effects of each
in our official tables, both as it regards our tonnage
and commerce They speak a language not to be
mistaken, and far stronger than any one could an-
ticipate who hasnot looked into the tables, oi made
himself well acquainted with the powei ful opera
tion of low duties in extending navigation and
commerce As much as I had anticipated from
their effects, the reduction of the duties—the light-
ening ol the burdens of commeice—have greatly
exceeded my most sanguine expectation
I shall begin with the tonnage, as more immedi-
ately connected with naval power, and, in order to
show the relative effects of high duties and low on
oui navigation, I shall compile the period from
1824, when the first gieat increase ot piotective
duties took place, to 1830, inclusive, when the first
reduction of duties commented During these
seven yeais, which lnilnilc theopeiation of the two
protective tariffs of 1821 and 1828,-that is, the
reign of the high pioucuve tinlí system,—our
foreign tonnage fell oil from 639,972 tons to 576,475,
equal to 01 4'*7, oui coasting tonnage fiom 71'< l')0
to 615,310, eq'ial to I0i,8h0tons— miking the filling
off in both equal to 165,370 tons Yes , to that ex
tent (103,880) did oui coasting tonnage decline—
the very tonnage, the mercase of which, it was
confidently predicted by the protective paity, w onld
make up for every possible loss in our foieign ton-
nage fiom their miserable quick sjstem Instead
ol that, the falling oil m the coistmg Hade is even
greater than in the foreign, proving clearly thit
high duties aie not less injurious to the home than
to the foreign trade
I pass now to the peuod (I will not siy of free
trade—it is I ir shoitot thai) of udi ction of high
protective dunes, mil now mtk Ihe rontnM be

the gieat reduction under the compromise act,
which is not yet onmplelcd, and which, in its fur-
ther progress, would add greatlj to the inuease, if

coasting for the same peuod increascdlrom 615 310
to ¡,280,999, equal to 665,6')') tons—moie thin dou
ble, and this, too, w hen, iccoidmg to the high tn i'l
doctrine, our coasting trade ougi t to have fallen
off, instead of increasing, (in consequence ot the
reduction of the duties ) and tl us un ontestib'j pro-
ving that low duties aie not less fa\orable to oui
domestic than to our foreign trade Th agiente
tonnage for the period has inci eased from 1,101,776
to 2,180,763—nearlj doubled Such and so fa von
ble to low duties in referente to tonnage is the re-
sult of the comparison betv een the two periods
The comparison m icfeience to commerce will
prove not less so In miking the comparison, 1
shall confine ixt) self to the export ft ide, not because
jtt gives íesults more favorable —ior the reverse is
the fact,—but because the Ua'j kins contracted
by the States during the líder pel iod (between
1830 and 1841) gave a factitious increase to the im-
ports, which would make the comparison appear
more favorable than it ought in reality tobe Their
effects were different on the exports They tended
{0 decrease rathan than increase then amount.   Of
the exports, I shall select domestic articles only,
because they only aie affected by the rate of the
duties, as the duties on foreign articles, paid or
secured by bond on their importation, are returned
on reshipment "With these explanatory remarks,
I shall now proceed to the comparison.
The amount in value of domestic article export-
ed for 1825 was $66,944,745, and in the year 1830
$59,469,029, making a falling off, under the high
tariff system, dunng that period, of $7,482,718
Divide the period into two' equal parts, of three
years each, and it will be found that the falling off
in the aggregate of the latter part, compared to the
former, is ¡813,090,25o; showing an average annual
decrease of $4,963,418 during tne latter part, com-
pared with the former
The result will be found very different on turn
mg to the period from 1830, when the reduction of
the duties commenced, to 1840, during the whole of
which the reduction has beengoingon. The value
of domestic exports for 1831 was 861,277,057, and
for 1840 «113,895,634, making a difference ot
$52,618,577, equal to eighty three per cent (omitting
fractions) for the ten yeais If the period be di-
vided into two equal parts, of five years each, the
increase of the latter, compared to the former, will
be found to be $139,089,371 , making an average
annual increase for the latter period (from 1835 to
1810) of $27,817,654 This rapid increase began
\vi h the great reduction under the compromise
act 01 1833 The very next year after it passed,
the domestic exports rose fiom $81,034,162 to
$101,189,082—just like the recoil which takes place
when Ihe weight is removed from the spring
But my friends from the manufacturing States
will doubtless say that this vast increase of exports
from reduction of dunes was t onfined to the great
agricultural s'aples, and thai the iffei sweie the
reveise as to the export of domestic manufactures
With their notion ot piotection, thev cannot be pre-
pared to believe tint low duties aie favorable to
I hem I ask them to sive me their'attention, while
I show how gieat their error is So far from not
partaking of this mighty impulse fiom the redac-
tion, llu i kit it 11101 > p iwei fully than othei niti-
dis of domestic exports, as I shall no  proceed to
show fiom the tables.
The exports of domestic manufactures during
the period from 1821 to 1832, inclusive—that is,
the period of the high protective duties under the
tariffs of 18'"H and 1828—fell fiom V,5,7i9 797 to

ot fixed and sfady causes, and not accidental
circumstances, while the immediate and progies-

wise and foreign, and of exports, including man
ulicluii 1 is y ell as other articles, with the la}ing
on of high duties, and the commencement unci
piogiess of tl eir reduction, pomt out, bexond all
controversy, high duties to be th' cawx of one, and
1 eduction—low (?} firs—that of th ol'ie?
It will oe 111 vim lor the advocates of high duties
to seek for a different explanation of the cause of
these striking and convincing facts 111 the histoiy
of t1 e two periods The first of these, from 1824
to 1832, is the very period v. hen the late Bank of
the United States was 111 the fu'lest and most suc-
cessful operation,—when exchanges, according
to then own showing, were ihe lowest and most
s'eady, and the currency the most uniform and
sound, and yet, with all these iavorable circum-
stances, which they estimate s0 highly, and with
no hostile cause operating from abroad, our ton-
nage and commerce, in every branch on which
the duties could operate, fell off on the contrary,
during the latter period, when all the hostile
causes which they are in the habit of daily de-
nouncing on this floor, and of whose disastrous
consequences we have heard so many eloquent
lamentations,—yes, in spite of contractions and
expansions, m spite of tampering with the cur-
rency and the removal of the deposites, m spite
of the disordered state of the whole machinery
of commerce, the deranged state of the currency,
both at home and abroad , in spite of the state of
the exchanges, and of what we are constantly
told of the agony of the country,—both have in-
creased, rapidly increased,—increased beyond all
former example ' Such is the overpowering effect
of removing w culits from the springs of industry,
and staking off shackles from the free exchange
of products, as to overcome all adverse causes
Let me add, Mr. President, that of this highly
prosperous period to industry, (however disastrous
to those who have over-speculated, or invested
their funds in rotten and swindling institutions,)
the most prosperous of the whole, as the tables
will show, is that dunng the operation of the sub-
treasury,—a period when some progress was made
towards the restoration of the currency of the
constitution In spite of the many difficulties and
embarrassments of that trying period, the progres-
sive reduction of the duties, and the gradual m-
tioduction of a sounder currency, gave so vigor-
ous a spring to our industry as to overcome them
all showing clearly, if the country was bles^d
with the full and steady operation of the two,
under favorable circumstances, that it would en-
joy a degree of prospenty exceeding what even
the friends of that measure anticipated.
Having now shown that the navy is the right
arm of our defence , that it depends on commerce
for its resources, both as to men and means, and
that high duties destroy the growth of our com-
meice, including navigation and tonnage, I have,
I trust, satisfactorily established the position which
I laid down,—that th s measure, which would
p'ace the entne bmden of supporting the Gov-
ernment on commeice, would paraly/e the right-
arm of oui powei Vote it down, and leave com-
merce as fiee as possible , and it will furnish am-
ple resouices, skilful and gallant sailors, and an.
overflowing treasury, to repel danger from our
shores, and maintain out rights and dignity in our
external relations With the aid of the revenue
from laud, and proper economy, we might soon
have ample means to enlarge our navy to that of
a third of the British, with duties far below the
limits oí 20 pet cent prescribed by the compro-
mise act Ihe annual appiopnation, or cost of
Ihe Buiish mvy, is about ^30,000,000. Ours,
with the addition of the appropriation for the
home squadion made this session, is (say) $6,
000,000, lecpuring only the addition of four mil-
lions to make it equal to a thud of that of Gieat
Britain, piovided that we cm build, equip, man,
and maintain ours as cheaply as she can hers
That we can with proper management, can
Scarcely be doubted, when we reflect that our nav-
igation, which involves almost all the elements of
expense that a im\ does, successfully competes
with heis ovei the world Noi are we deficient
in men—gallant and haul) sulois—toman a navy
on aslaigca scale as is suggested Already our
tonnage is two thirds of that of G'eat Britain,
and will 111 a short time approach an equality with
hers, if our commerce should be fanly treated
Leave, then, in the Treasury, the funds proposed
to be withdrawn by this detestable bill, apply it
to the navy and defences of the countiy, and
even at its piesent amount, with small additional
aid from the impost, it will give the means ol
raising 11, wnh the existing appropriation, to the
point suggested, and wnh the steady increase
of ihe fund from the increased sales of lands,
keeping pace with the increase of our population,
and the like increase of conmerce under a sys-
tem of light and equal duties, we may, with pro-
per economy m the collection and disbursements
of the revenue, raise our navy steadily, without
feeling the burden, to half the size of the British,
—01 more, if more be needed for defence and the
maintenance of our lights Beyond that, we
ought nevei to aim
I have (said Mr C ) concluded what I proposed
to say I have passed over many and weighty
objections to this measure, which 1 could not bring
withm the scope of my remarks, without exhaust-
