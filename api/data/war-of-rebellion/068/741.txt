General GILLMORE:

Dispatch received. Don't open up the gap between our flanks too wide. We are here between the two creeks; Kingsland Creek is their line. Can you turn that?

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

I received your dispatch about Colonel West's cavalry, and immediately directed a portion of them to report to General Ames. Colonels Cole's and Garrard's cavalry, I know nothing about. They may form a portion of Colonel West's brigade for aught I know. We have taken the right of the enemy's line of works after a severe fight. Rations and ammunition should be sent here for the men. There are some platform cars on the branch road beyond Chester Station loaded with lumber. I brought a piece of artillery forward on one of them this a.m. Rations and ammunition can be sent by the same way. You had better notify General Ames about his rations.

Respectfully, &amp;c.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

I have your two dispatches. Provisions for this portion of my command for two days have been ordered up. I have given no orders about it to General Turner or Ames. I have sent in to Colonel West to send to General Ames that portion of his command left back to rest. About an hour ago General Ames sent me word that the enemy's pickets were in his fronting small force, and that his cavalry connected with our left on the railroad.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
