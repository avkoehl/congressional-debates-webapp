THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 24,
The farmer cannot avoid competition with
the grain-fields of Europe. Should diminished
production, or dearth, or increased production
in other pursuits turn the course of grain trans-
portation to instead of from this country he
must compete still. If the labor in England is
cheaper than the labor of the United States,
and labor in the grain-producing regions on
the continent still cheaper than in England, so
long as any surplus wheat of American growth
is offered for sale side by side with continental
wheat, how can the American agriculturist
prevent competition with the cheap labor of
Europe 1
We are told that we must diversify our indus-
try ; thai the farmers of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, and Missouri are
producing too much grain ; that we must let
tome of our fields lie idle, and our capital
invested in farm implements and stock be con-
verted into other forms of capital; that the
people engaged in agricultural pursuits must be
compelled, by imposing heavy duties on com-
modities consumed, to engagein manufactures.
Distant from the supplies of the raw material
as well as distributing centers for manufactured
articles, without accumulated capital, and with
high rates for its use, the western farmer, driven
by necessity from his farm, attempting to com-
pete with manufactures in older States possess-
ing these advantages in which his State is defi-
cient, finds that the tariff to be of benefit to
him must commence its protection on the shores
of the northern lakes and extend its limits to
the eastern slope of the Alleghanies.
But it is said that a reduction of the duty on
iron, salt, and other manufactured articles will
cheapen labor. With the reduction in the cost
of food and the means of living ought not and
cannot manufacturing labor accept the same
diminished reward that the agricultural re-
ceives ? Will a reduction in duties correspond-
ing to the reduction in food and the profits
of agriculture break down manufactures? All
being lowered alike there would be no in-
ducement to change to a business where the
profits and compensation were reduced in the
same degree. If the manufacturers in the
country requiring high protection to compete
with foreign goods of the same class should
cease to manufacture, but a portion of the
laborers would engage in fanning; a large
proportion would engage in other avocations.
The honorable gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia [Mr. Scofield] who addressed the com-
mittee eloquently descanted upon the benefits
that manufactures conferred upon the coun-
try by inducing immigration of artisans and
skilled laborers from manufacturing countries
abroad. I desire to call attention to the fol-
lowing synopsis of statistics presented by the
report of the Commissioner of Immigration for
the year 1869:
"During tho year 1869 tho total number of alien
passengers arriving in Now York was 258,989—an
excoss ot 45,303 over that of 1868, and 75,309 more
than tho average of former years. Among the differ-
ent nationalities embraced in the immigrants of last
year, Germany is represented by 99,605, Ireland by
Ob,204, and England by41,090persons; anditisshown
that wliilo the German immigration has slightly
lallen off, the immigration from England lias in-
creased 33 per cent., and that from Ireland nearly
50 per cent.
_ '"Tho principal points of destination taken by the
JTlcomiri^ passengers were as follows: California,
,5,806; Illinois, 38,213; Iowa, 8,216; Massachusetts,
York, fco,810; Ohio, 12,180; Pennsylvania, 32,135;
Wisconsin, 17,003. During the year 2,327 Mormons
arrived; o,<44 telegraphic dispatches werereoeived
and sent by lmmigi ants, 9,999 letters-were written lor
them, and S:>0,549 wore sent to the commissioners in
anticipation of th e arrival of immigrants. Employ-
men nvas procured for 31,9)5 immigrants—nearly 4,0t;0
more than the previous year—of whom 5,594 were
mechanics, 17,250 agricultural and unskilled labor-
ers, 738 skilled female laborers, and 11,673 house ser-
vants. These figures show a slight falling off from
those of 1868 in the two latter branches."
Of 84,955 furnished employment 17,250,
nearly one half, were agricultural and unskilled
laborers. Only 5.594 were mechanics. Of
258,989 arriving in New York 75,000, one
third of the whole, went to the northwestern
agricultural States, and 85,000 remained in
New York city or State.
These are the immigrants that a high tariff
is bringing to our shores. It shows conclu-
sively that the effect of restrictions on imports
of manufactured goods is not to send us an
immigration exclusively of skilled laborers,
but chiefly of unskilled and agricultural labor-
ers ; and this is what we should expect from the
comparative ability of skilled and unskilled
labor in securing employment at home. Supe-
rior intelligence and skill are prized in every
avocation. If work is slack or suspended in
one trade the skilled laborer can successfully
compete with the unskilled in the lower-priced
employments. His intelligence and discipline
soon make him more valuable in tho new em-
ployment, and theunskilled laboreris set aside
for the better workman. The rewards of
labor are lowered from the highest down, and
not merely the artisan but the peasant laborer
must accept less compensation. The induce-
ment to emigrate will not be greater for the
skilled than the unskilled. It will depend
upon the strength of home ties which first
emigrates. In fact it would become a necessity
sooner with the unskilled, because when the
competition of the skilled labor has deprived
him of employment there is no other lower grade
which he can seek at home. We know from
observation that a large proportion of the im-
migrants pass directly to the West and engage
in agricultural production.
An increase of manufacturing here has not
diminished the amount of our agricultural sur-
plus, or sensibly increased the price of any of
the exportable farm products. If it has dimin-
ished manufacturing abroad it has either driven
more laborers there to agricultural pursuits,
and cheapened grain abroad and consequently
in this country, or it has driven men to this
country who seek agricultural pursuits as well
as other avocations, and increased the farm
products of this country.
The honorable gentleman from New York,
[Mr. McCarthy,] in his argument in favor of
the tariff bill reported by the committee and
the retention of the present duty on salt, said:
" To-day, as the result of a protective tariff, wo are
supplied with most articles of cotton and woolen
fabric, with merchantable iron and steel and their
products, with iron and ateel rails, and salt, from
domestic industry at a price which compels the for-
eign importer to pay the duty himself when offering
like productions in competition with our own. Salt,
tho domestic production of which h*as increased from
12,000,OOOto20,000,000bushels,and the foreign dimin-
ished only about 1,500.000 bushels under the present
tarift, has fallen in price by reason of domestic com-
petition to a lower point than it was in 1S60 in most
oftheleadingmarketsof thecountry. In New York
in I860 foreign salt Fold at23 cents per bushel in gold;
to-day domestic salt is 23 cents in currency. Thus
the fact is dernomlrated-that domestic production
has overcome tho advance by the tariff, and made
salt cheaper generally throughout the country; in
the West especially, cheaper than either foreign or
domestic salt from 1856 to 1860."
The finance report of tho Secretary of tho
Treasury for the year 1863, in a table of prices
of staple articles in New York for a series of
years, gives the following average prices :

A table of the prices of leading articles of
general consumption in New York furnished
by the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. Coburx,]
which, I presume, is correct, gives the follow-
ing quotations of Liverpool sack :

Reduce the price of the last four years from
currency to gold value, and we shall have the
price of Liverpool sack to range from $1 60 to
$160, about the amount of advance of the
tariff. Where the figures for thecurrency price
of salt in New York on the day the gentleman
made his speech were obtained we are not
informed.
Here is the quotation of prices in the New
York Journal of Commerce of the 16th instant,
giving the price of salt in New York Tuesday,
March 15, 1870:
Turk's Island, per bushel 42@44 cents.
Domestic bulk  40@42 cents.
Gold the same day was 12f per cent, pre-
mium. Take off 5 cents premium, in convert
ing currency price to gold, and we have price
of Turk's Island salt 37 to 39 cents iri gold.
Compare price of same in 1860 and we have
advance, 19 to 20 cents per bushel.
The quotations of the wholesale price u1 d
salt in New York, given in the New York Daily
Bulletin of yesterday, March 23, which I hold
in my hand, are:

The census report for 1860 shows that the
annual product of domestic saltwas 12,717,000
bushels, employingin 399 establishments 2,213
hands at a cost of the labor $371,954, and the
annual value of the product $2,289,504, or 18
cents per bushel. The census report for 18G0
states the cost per bushel of manufacturing
in the State of New York to be 17 cents per
bushel, and the average cost in the whole Uni-
ted States to be 18 cents per bushel, while in
Ohio the cost was only 15|- cents per bushel.
The tariff on foreign saltwas then 15 per cent.
ad valorem, or about 2 cents per bushel. The
present tariff is equivalent to 10 and 14 cents
per bushel. The gentleman makes the amount
of the salt manufactured in the country 20,-
000,000 bushels. If the number of persons
engaged in the manufacture increased in pro-
portion to the product the present number
employed would be 3,481 persons. If of the
20,000,000 bushels produced by domestic man-
ufacture the price of the product is enhanced
to the consumer the amount of the duty, about
10 cents a bushel, the cost to the tax-payer*
for employing those men is $2,000,000, not a
dollar of which goes into tho Treasury.
Every cent a bushel on the cost of salt con-
sumed in this country is $300,000, of which
$200,000 is for the purpose of employing 3,481
at that industry, equal to $57 55 each. Were
the duty paid by the foreign producer and the
home consumer, each an equal part, the bonus
paid for each salt-maker in this country would
be $287 75 apiece. We could afford to pay men
that sum to be idle or engage in some other
business. But the price in former years and
at the present time conclusively shows that it
is paid wholly by the consumer. We pay to
the owners of the salt-springs and the salt-
works and to 3,481 persons engaged in salt-
making a sum equal to $575 50 apiece to keep
them lrom engaging in farming. We impose
this tax chiefly upon the farming interest to
keep the salt-makers from wheat-raising. If
the salt-makers can show that after a few years'
aid their coal-fed furnaces can compete with
the pauper labor of a tropical sun in evapor-
ating brine, this enormous subsidy might be
endured without great murmur.
If a duty, averaging nearly 100 per cent, on
the^ cost of the foreign article, is necessary to
maintain this branch of industry we may well
consider if it were not better to abandon it.
Ihe business, under a tariff of 15 per cent, from
1857 to 1801, seems to have been flourishing.
Does it require more protection as the business
becomes established?
_ But the chief objection to the duty upon salt
is that of the $3,000,000 paid for revenue and
protection, the greater part is paid by sec-
tions of the country and industries that receive
no corresponding benefits. The chief consump-
tion of salt is by those engaged in fisheries,
and in raising and curing beef and pork. The
cattle-grower must supply this article to his
stock. To the packer of pork and beef it is
80 much addition to the cost, and must to some
