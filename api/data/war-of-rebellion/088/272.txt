HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Gurley House, August 18, 1864-7 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The head of my column is closing up and forming here as near as we can to the enemy's vedettes without his observation. As soon as I am well in hand and prepared to follow up rapidly I shall advance. There has been nothing to report this morning. Our cavalry here have no information except that the enemy's pickets last night told them they were to be relieved this morning. The two regiments of cavalry are so distributed on picket that none of them will be available until I can drive away the enemy had relieve those to the right of us.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Our advance encountered nothing but cavalry, and captured some of them from the Seventh Confederate. My troops have reached the railroad and cut the telegraph wire. The intense heat causes many men to fall out.

Respectfully,

Major-General.
