[CHAP. XXXII.
HEADQUARTERS BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION,Near Hoover's Gap, Tenn., May 6, 1863.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Early in April last,* and immediately after reading General Bragg's official report of the battles before Murfreesborough, I had the honor to address a brief letter to you, protesting against its representations in regard to my command and myself, and asking for a court of inquiry. I have received no answer to that letter, and it may be that the interests of the service will prevent the early assembling of a court. In the mean time General Bragg's report has appeared in print, and will be read by many thousands in all parts of the Confederacy. Under these circumstances, I have to request, in respectful, but earnest, terms, that my letter, asking for a court, may be published, as an act of simple justice to myself and my division.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General, Provisional Army, Confederate States.

REMARKS.

I cannot account for the want of so many guns otherwise than the wanton carelessness of the troops in leaving them on the field or throwing them away whilst on the retreat. The excuse the officers give is that several arms were put in wagons and lost by being misplaced. I have also to report the absence of two regiments, the Ninth Kentucky, at Manchester, and the Thirty-second Tennessee, at Wartrace, the wants of which regiments I am unable to report.

Respectfully submitted.

CHARLES SEMPLE,

Ordnance Officer.

Captain O'HARA, Assistant Adjutant-General, Breckinridge's Division.

Numbers 226. Report of Brigadier General Daniel W. Adams, C. S. Army, commanding First Brigade.

ATLANTA, GA., January 12, 1863.

COLONEL: Owing to a slight wound which I received in the left arm, I have not been able to report sooner the part taken by my brigade in the engagement before Murfreesborough on the 31st ultimo.
