Colonel POWELL CLAYTON,

Commanding, Pine Bluff, Ark.:

Dispatch received; 2,500 men are on the way to Pine Bluff to escort a train of supplies, thence to General Steele. Can you strengthen it by 200 cavalry and 300 infantry? It should go as strong as possible. Your front will be free as long as this force is in advance. I rely upon your assurance that the Saline can be crossed without delay. Can you give Mrs. McLean any information about her husband's position?

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
