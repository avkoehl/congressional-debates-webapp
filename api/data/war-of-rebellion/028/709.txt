I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The diminution of our cavalry causes me the greatest uneasiness. General Stuart reports that about three-fourths of his horses are afflicted with sore tongue, but a more alarming disease has broken out among them, which attacks the foot, producing lameness, and in some cases loosening the hoof and causing it to slough off. I have only heard of it as yet among the cavalry, and, therefore, cannot attribute it to new corn or want of salt, as General Stuart does; but it may be produced from these causes, in conjunction with the labor and exposure which the horses have undergone. Unless some means can be devised of recruiting the cavalry, I fear that by spring it will be inadequate for the mounted men are unable to purchase them. I had thought of publishing an order authorizing the transfer to the cavalry of infantry soldiers who could furnish their horses and equipments, and of replacing them in their regiments by the dismounted cavalry, but I know of no authority for transferring the cavalry to the infantry without the consent of the former, and I apprehend this could not be obtained. I fear there is no way of procuring sufficient horses for the cavalry, unless they are provided by the Government, and for this purpose it may be necessary to bring them from Texas. In my anxiety to provide a remedy for the evil that now exists and threatens us in the future, I desire to call your attention to the subject, in the hope that you may suggest some means of meeting it. If I could procure light and long-range carbines for the dismounted men, perhaps they could be employed as sharpshooters in conjunction with the cavalry. If none can be procured in the country, cannot a proper arm be imported?

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
