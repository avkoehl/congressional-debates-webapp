the Constitution should be so amended that no man should take
his sea* in Congress who was not a freeholder Did his col
league assent to this condition too? All these points rested
on the same giocod If one was to be considered as a condition
of ranfic itioo so were the others His colleague had sworn to
support "the Constitution of the united States " Butwhatdidhe
mean by the Constitution? Was it the Constitution as recorded
in the book, or as conditionally ratified by the State of New
York? Did hi  colleague swear to support the Constitution
condl'iondtly orabsolutely?
Mr B heid went into a general reference to the history of
thepenod preceding the adoption of the Constitution, and the
great apprehensions entertained by many of the leading patriots
oftheatate of New York, that that State would refuse to join
the Union Two of her Representatives in the GeneialCon
vention to form a Constitution—Messrs Yates and Lansing—
had seceded from that body before the form of the instrument
was agreed upon, and had stated their Teasons in a letter to
George Clinton, then Governor of the State All the objections
to the ratification had beensummed up, by the Opposition party
m the State Convention, m a proviso,beginning with the words
"on condition, nevertheless," and the great question was on the
adoption 01 rejection of the proviso the party in favoi of rati
firation moved to sit ike out the wolds "on condition, neverthe
less" and substitute the words "in lull confidence," nor was
it hut by the almost superhuman exertions of Hamilton and
Robert R I ivmgston that this amendment was adopted, by a
voto ol 31 to 29 Those who then opposed the ratification m
various Stales, and embarrassed it by every conceivable expe
dient, did so because they hated the Constitution, and their de
scendants, adopting iheir principles, had followed m their foot
stef a, and hated itnow, as their fathers did then
Ml B was of opinion that the time had arrived for Congress
to assume the exercise of its constitutional power in the case,
because the present mode of conducting elections in the differ-
ent States was not equal or uniform
This Government was now, ever had been, and ever would
be, because it ever must be, carried on and administered by
party It had so begffn and so continued, and would be eo ad
ministered at this hour, but for such a concurrence of events as
had never before been witnessed The Federal party had re
mained m power for the first twelve years the an  Federal or
Democratic party had succeeded m turning them out, and had
held the reins for the next twenty eight years Then came in a
new party with no principles, but a general ery of "retrench
ment and lefoim, • and they had reigned twelve years, till at
last the Whigs, by an overwhelming majority, had put them to
the rout, and would now hold the administration of the Govern
ment but for the unhappy division which had ansen between
the executive ard Legislative departments
Mr 13 scorned the idea of conducting the Government with-
out party, and when he heard gentlemen profess such a pur
pose, he thought they meant very little of what they said it
was an i He di earn And if the Government must proceed on
piny principles how unfanly did rhe present unregulated sys
temwork By adopmigihe system of general ticket, Alabama
came into the House wi h -i party strength of five votes, while
New\ork, wuh forty Representatives, exerted a party force
of but .wo votes Was this fair? What he contended lor was
umlormlty Whichever way the rule might work, let us have
one rule tor all
He quoted Mr Madison in supporter his views, and insisted
that, when he wroie no such notion as that of a geneial ticket
system had entered anybody's head it wasan afterthought, de
vised for paity ends
As the existing st ite ol things worked so unequally and un
fanly, Mi li concluded that the time had arrived forthe action
of the Generalf! ii eminent in establishing a uniform mode of
election throu   lout all the States

THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion of Mr EVANS, the Senate proceeded to the con-
sideration, as in committee of the whole, of the bill making
appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the Gov-
ernmentforthe year 1842, and the amendments of ihe Commit
tee on Finance thereto
The next amendment was in page 25 After line 579, insert
"For allowance to law agent, assistant counsel, and district at-
torney, under acts providing for the settlement of private land
claims in Florida, three thousand five hundred and thirty five
dollars and eighty two cents "
Mr KING conceived the district attorney of Flonda was
bound, by law, to attend to those duties He, there/ore, wished
to know if there was any thing peculiar in the nature of these
claims to require the expense of m assistant counsel or agent
Mr EVANS stated that the construction put upon the law
by the committee, was, that an agent was necessary It pro-
vides for the employment, by the President, of a law agent and
assistant counsel, and authorizes him to male such compensa
tío to them, as well as to the district attoiney, as he may think
necessary 1 ir securing the interests of the United States This
appropriation is to the end of the first quarter of the present
year for these three officers and $1,500 for the district attorney
for the remainder of the year
Mr KING considered the fact to be this—that the appropria-
tion caused the appointirent and that the moment the appro
priation ceased, all necessity for the appointment would cease
If the case was limited to this year, and then to cease, it would
not be so much matter
Mr EVANS explained, that it was so limited
Mr SEVIER pointed out that there was a greater allowance
of judges and district attorneys for the Territory, than for sev
eral of the States even without a law agent and assistant
counsel
Mr EVANS observed, that the necessity for a law agent and
assistant counsel, grew out of the extreme difficulty of obtaining
witnesses and evidence to sustain the rights of the United States
to any large tracts of land
Mr HUNTINGTON hoped the law making these allowances
would be repealed He called the attention of the Committee
on Retrenchment to the evident sense of the Senate on this
matter.
Mr MOREHEAD considered the facts to be that a law ex
ists authorizing the appointments and expenditure, and that
the services have been rendered under the law, and it could
hardly now be a question whether the payment should be
made, however justibequestion might be of lepealing the law
Mr SEVItsR would have no objection to the present appro-
priation, with a proviso which he offered, to the following ef
feet
"Provided, That no allowance shall be h«reaper made for
compensation to a law agent, assistant counsel, or extra pay
to the distnet attorney of Florida, for attending to the settlement
of private land claims in Florida "
Mr EVANS objected to the proviso offered by the Senator
from Ai kansas because, while the law is left in force, authoriz-
ing the Pi e^i'ent to make the appointments, and incur a cer-
tain expense an enactment is made m an appropriation bill,
that no future appropriation «hall be made „o meet liabilities
mcuired under that law
Mr HUNTINGTON asked the Senetor from Arkansas to
withdraw his amendment, and offer It in the shape of a resolu
Hon to repeal the law
Mr SEVIERasked the Senator from Connecticut if he se-
riously thought lite resolution would ever be acted upon
Mr HUNTINGTON said he did
Mr  WOODBURY asked if this appropriation was in the
general estimates?
Mr EVANS was not prepared to say
Mi CUT HBERT observed that the fact of this proposition
having been stricken out in theflouse y, as evidence that it was
considered improper
The question was then taken on Mr Sevier s amendment,
which was apopted—yeas 17, nays 15
The amendmentas amended was then adopted
The next amendment was page 25, lines 592 and 593, to strike
out both lines, being "To put m a suitable condition for occu
pation the marine hospital at Mobile, ten thousand dolíais "
v> hich was considered m connexion with the preceding section
(No 177) viz same page lines 590 and 591,' To put m a suit'
able condition for occupation the marine hospital at Mobile, five
thousand dollars '
Mr KING objected to this amendment If S5 000 would only
put the hospital in condition foi occupation, and «15,000 would
complete it why not make one appropriationfsrthe $15000, or
whatever the cost of completion mishtbe?                      '
Mr EVANS explained that the committee would have been
men e in favor of an appropriation to complete the hospital, than
to go on making small appropriations meiely to make the
buikhngs fit for occupation The question really was, whether
$5 000 would be voted for rendeung the building tenantable,
or $15 000 for finishing the building But certainly both appro
pnati<on<? as they now stand ought not to be made
Mr WOODBURY suggested the propriety of letting- the mat
ter lie over till the bill is reported back to the Senate, and by
that tim* information could be obtame I on the subject
Mr KÍNG suggested the propriety of striking out both ap
propnaticns, and insert in place of them $15,000 to finish the
buildings
Mr EVANS personally had no objections, if the $15000
was put in asan appropriation to comí lete the marine hospital
of Mobile
Mr WOODBURY showed that, by inserting the words "to
complete " and changing "five" into ' fifteen," the object might
be attained
Mr EVANS 'hought the object would be attained by adopt
ing the committee's proposed amendment, and then making im
additional amendment
Ihe committee's amendment was then ador ted
Mr KING now moved an amendment to strike out the ap-
