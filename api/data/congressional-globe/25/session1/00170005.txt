In view ol these facts, it w ould seem impossible
for sincere inquirers after truth to resist the convic-
tion, that the causes of the ]evulsion in both coun-
tries have been substantially the same Two

arrested m their career, and plunged into a slate oí
embairass nent and ai^tiess In both countries we
have witnessed tne «ame redundancy of paper
monej, and other facil tic of credit, the same spirit
of speculation, the same paitial succe scs, the same
difficulties, and íeverscs, and, at length, nearly the

diffeience between the resu'ts in the two countries
ha« only been that with us there has also occuned
an pt eisi/e derangement m ihe fiscal affansof the
Feder 1 and State Governments, occasioned I y the
suspension of specie pav men's by the banks
The nistory oí tnese causes and effects, ir Great
Bnta n and the United States, is substantially th 
history of the i"vulson in all other commercial
countries
The present and v wl 'e effects of these circum-
stances on ti e opeiations of the Government, -md
on the industry ol the people, point out the object*
which call for yom immediate attent on
They are—lo legulate by law Ihe safe Keep ng,
transfei, and disbursement, of the public moneys,
lo designate the funds to be lecened and paid
by the Government, to enab'e the Treasuij to

the const tu lonal competency of Congress, as will
be best calculated to reuve the enteiprise and to
promote the prosperity of the country
For the deposite, transfer, and disbursement, of
the revenue, National and State banks have
ahvavs, witn lemporaiy and limited exceptions,
been hcrelofore emplo}ed, but, all! ough advocates
oí each svstem rre still to be found, it is apparent
hat the ev cuts of the la«t fe / months have greatly

Bank ot the United States, with the vas powcis
confeired in it by Gi rgitss, did not or could not
prevent f<imer rill sm dar embauassm°nts, noi
has the still greater s rength it has been «aid to pos
ses , undei its pies-mt charter, enabled it, in the
cxi-ti ig emergency, to check other institution , oi
even to save itself In Great Britain, where it has
been seen, ihe same causes have been attended with
the same effecis, a national  bank, possessing pow-
ers far greater than aie psked foi by the warmest
advocates of su<h an msiiti tion here, has aho
proved un"b'e to pi event an undue expansion of
credit, and the evils that flow from it Nor
can I find any 'enable ground for the re-esta-
blishment of a national bank, m the derangement
alleged at pt esent to exist in the domestic exchanges
of the coi nlry, c m the facilities it may be capa-
ble of affording them Although advantages of
this son were anticipated when the first Bank of the
United States w as c ealed, they vvert regarded as
an incidental accommodation, not one which the
Federal Government was bound, or could he called
upon, to furnish This accommodation is now,
indeed, after Ihe lapse of not many jears, demand-
ed from it as among it  first duties, and an 0mis
sion to aid and regulate commeicial exchange, is
treated as a ground of loud and serious complaint
Such results oniv snrve to exemplify the constant
desne, among some of our citizens, to enlarge the
powers of the Government, and extend its control to
sul jeets vv ílh which it sliouln not mteiieie They
can never justify the creation oí an institHtion to
piomote uch objee s On the contrary, they justly
excite among Ihe community a more diligent in-
quiry into the character of those ope-ationsof tiade,
towards which it is desned to extend such peculiar
favors
The various transactions which bear the name
ot domestic exchanges, differ essentially in then
natuie, opeiation, and utility One class of then'
consists of bills of exchange, drawn for the pur-
pose (t transferring actual capital fiom one pait
of the country to another, or to anticipate ihe pro-
ceeds of propelty actually transmitted Bills of
this description are highly useful in ihe movements
of trade, and well de ervc ■> 1 the encouragement
which can rignfuliv b  given to l ic Another
class is made up of bills ol e h in.,-*, ni t drawn to

and swelling the mass of paper credits to a vast
extent in the most objectionable manner These
bills have formed, foi the last few yeais, a laige
proportion of wl at are termed the domestic ex-
changes of the countiy, serving as the means of
usunous profit, and constituting ihe most unsafe
and precaaous paper in cnculition This species
ot traffic, instead of being upheld, ought to be dis-
countenanced by the Govern nent and the people
In tiansieinng its funds fr< m place to place, ihe
Govcinmei t is i n he same fi olmg with Ihe private
ciii/en and may usort 10 ihe s-me ¡e^al means

itself, orpurchased fiom o hers and in these opera-
tions it mav, in a manner undoubtedly cons'ilu-
tional and legitimate, facihtate and assist exchanges
of individuals founded on re il transactions of trade
The extent to which this may be done, and the best
means oí effecting it, are entitled to the fullest con-
sideratu n This has been lestowed by the bee e-
taiy oí the Treasury, and his views will be submit-
ted to jou in his report
But it was not designed by the Constitution that
Ihe Government should assume the management of
domestic or foreign exchange It is indeed autho-
rized to regulate by law the commerce between the
S'ates, and to provide a general standard of value,
or medium of exchange, n gold and sihei,
but it is not its province to aid indiv i luals in the
traasfer of their funds, otherw ise than through the
facilities affoidedb} the Post Office Dcpar ment As
j istly might it be called on to puvidef i the trans
pi ilation of their merchandise These aie operations
of trade Thev ought to be concluded by those
^¡ho are interested m them, m ihe same manner
that the incidental difficulties of other pursuits are
encountered by other classes, of citizens Such aid
has not been deemed necesfcry m other countries
Thioughout Euiope, the domest c as well as the
foreign exchanges are carried on by pi iv ate house ,
often, if not generally, without th  assistance of
banks Yet they extend throughout distinct sove-
reignties, and fai exceed in amount tne real ex-
cba ges of the United States There is no reason
why our own may not be conducted in the same
manner, with equal cheapness and safety,   Cer-
tainly this might be accomplished, tf it were favored
by those most deep]} intucsted, and lew can doubt
that then own inteiest, as well as the general wel-
fare of the countiy, would be promoted by leaving
such a subject m the hands of those to whom it
pi opeily belongs A system founded on private
interest, entei prise and competition, without the
aid of legislative giants or regulations by law,
would rapidlv prospei, it would be free from the
liiih ence oi political agitation, and extend the same
exemption to tiade itself, and it would put an end
to those complaints of neglect, partiality, injustice,
and oppiession, which are the unavoidable results
of interference by the Government, in the proper
concerns of individuals All former attempts on
■the part of the Government lo carry its legislation,
in this lespect, further than was designed by the
Const tution, have in the end pioved injunous,
and have seived only to convince the great body of
the people, more anel more of theceitain dangeis
of blending private interests wilh the operations
of public buiiuess, and mere is no reason to sup-
pose that a repetition oí them now w ould be more
successful
It cannot be concealed that there exis's, m oui
community, opinions and feelings on Ibis sub-
ject in direct opposition to each other. A la ge
portion oí them, combining great intelligence,
activity, and influence, are no doubt sincere m
then belief that the operations of trade ought to be
assisted by such a connection, tney regard a na-
tional bank as necessary for (his purpose, and they
are disinclined to e\ ery measure that does not tern',
sooner oi later, to the establishment of such an in-
stitution On the other hand, a majonty of the
people are believed to be nicconcilably opposed to
that measuie they coi sider sjUi a concentration
of power dangerous to then hleiues and manv of
thun regard it as a violaticn of the Co'istnu-

commerci 1 tiansactions ol the country have lately
been exposed Banking has become a political
topic of the highest interest, and trade has suffered
in ihe conflict of parties A speedv termination of
this state of things, howevei desirable, is scarcely
lo be expected We have seen foi nearly half a
centni}, that those who advocate a national bank,
by whatever motive they may be influenced, con-
stitute a poitionof our community too numerous to
allow us to hope for an early abandonment of their
fav orite plan On the other hand, they must indeed
form an en oneous estimate oi the ntelligence and
temper of the American people, who sipposc that

They have been lepealedly and unreseivcdly an-
nounced to my fellow citizens who, with full
1 now ledge ol them, conferí ed upon me the t vo
highest offices of the Government On the last of
these occasions, I felt it due to the people to ap-
pnze them distmcth , that, in the event of my elec-
tion, 1 would not be able to co opeiale in the le-
estabhshment of a natu nal bank To these senti-
ments, I have navv only to add th  express on of an
increased crnviction, In a the re-es'ablishment of
such a bank, in any form whilst it would iu t ac-
complish the herencia! purjose promised by its
•hIv cca<->s, would impair the rightful supremacy oí
ihe populai will, injure the charao'er and dimmish
the influence of oui political system, and bring
once moie into existence a concentrated mone}«l
power, hostile to the spnit, anl t lreaiemng the
permanency, of oui republican institutions
Local banks have been employ ed for the depo-
site ?nd distribution oi the revenue, at all times
