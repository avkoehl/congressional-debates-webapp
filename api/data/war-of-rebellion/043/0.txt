"Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16, 1880, has provided:for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10, 000 copies of the Official Records(Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year"; and that "of said number, 7, 000 copies shall be for the Senate, and 1, 000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments. "*This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.

PREFACE.

The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, order, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed is to be accompanied by an Atlas. In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &amp;c., not embraced in the" reports" proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate)in chronological order. The 2nd Series will contain the correspondence, order, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far the military authorities were concerned)to State or political prisoners. The 3rd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials)not relating specially to the subjects of the first and seconds series. It will set forth the annual and specials reports of the Secretary of War, of the General in Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the national and the several State authorities. The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, order, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and Confederate authorities given in that series.
