It is not probable that you will require all of your artillery in the pursuit.

If you should have trouble in keeping it up with you, you may leave part of it and double-team the balance.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

The commanding general directs that the movement in the direction of Tazewell, which you were directed to make by my letter of last night, be for the present suspended. Let Colonel Corns resume with his brigade his position near Little War Gap. The battery that has been sent you by General Corse you may retain.

Brigadier General M. D. CORSE,

Commanding Brigade:

A telegram from the Adjutant and Inspector General directs that your brigade be sent at once to Petersburg for an emergency. The commanding general therefore desires that you will moves as early as you possibly can in the morning, and meet the cars for your transportation at Bristol or at Carter's Station, as may be most convenient. Please notify me, however, of the point for which your march will be directed. The remainder of the division will be left where it is, under the senior officer. Please advise me if General Jackson has gone after the bushwhackers as proposed. Your transportation is not to be taken with you. Please cause it to be turned in to Major Taylor, chief quartermaster. You had better send your ordnance stores here to be turned in.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Commanding Brigade:

I inclose a letter for Major G. W. Day, from which you will observe that the commanding general has intrusted to that officer an expedition to the vicinity of Tazewell for the capture of the enemy's force reported to be there. To carry out this design I am instructed to direct that you place as soon as possible under the command of Major Day all the well-mounted men of your brigade, and a number of officers and men (well mounted) of Jones' brigade, sufficient to give Major Day a force of 500 efficient officers and men.
