cavalry at my command constant employed, but they are not sufficient for the task. My instructions to Colonel Fitch are such that he could not permit himself to be cut off, but he may fail in affording relief to General Curtis. I do not doubt the sincerity of my informant, but never estimate numbers to be equal to that reported. Same informant says that he saw letters from men of Pike's command which said they had been ordered into Fort Smith.

Major-General.

CORINTH, June 30, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Report immediately the effective force under command at Memphis and vicinity, exclusive of Sherman's and Hurlbut's divisions; also the parts of Wallace's division which can be concentrated at Memphis. I don't want comments, but facts.

The defeat of McClellan at Richmond has created a stampede at Washington. I want facts as to position, as to troops, and how they can be concentrated, in order to enable me to answer questions and carry out orders. State precisely how many troops you have transportation to Cairo from Memphis for.

I want exact facts.

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 30, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Corinth, Miss.:

The drovers who were captured on their return from La Fayette have got back. One of them has reported to me that they were carried about 10 miles south of Holly Springs. The force at that point was Jacksons cavalry and one regiment besides. He heard the determination expressed not to permit the cars to run or supplies to be carried over the road.

I have re-enforced Colonel Fitch with three cavalry regiments, and sent one regiment of infantry and five companies of cavalry to guard the road. An escort of 150 men is now going via Rolla with beef cattle for Sherman's command.

My present effective force here is five infantry regiments, about 190 cavalry, and four batteries. From this, two companies of infantry and one of cavalry are escorting a wagon train to Germantown, one company guarding a barge to White River, and the 150 men guarding beef cattle.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, June 30, 1862.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

Have you steamers at Memphis to transport Wallace's division, except the part at Grand Junction, to Cairo or Saint Louis?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
