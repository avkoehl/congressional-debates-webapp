important that your command support him at the lower crossings before the enemy gets there. I hope to get off from here on Monday. In the meantime assume command of all the troops on Brier Creek by my orders. Cook's battalion of 100men, under Captain Sims, at Rae's and Godwyn's Bridges, will be subject to your orders. Several hundred negroes have been ordered down to the lower crossings. Post the troops and set the negroes to work at such points as your judgment dictates.

Very respectully,
