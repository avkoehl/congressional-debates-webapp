GENERAL: The General-in-Chief has read with much interest your confidential communication of the 18th instant, but has no instructions to add to your arrangements, which are left entirely to yourself, as being most capable, from your superior local knowledge, to carry out the important object you have in contemplation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have received intelligence from General Rosecrans to-day that a rebel force of 7,000 was about to attack Gallatin, and that Morgan (with 12,000 cavalry and infantry, supported by Kirby Smith) was to cross the Cumberland at Gainesborough for a raid into Kentucky. I not only cannot spare a man for Columbus, but have called upon Governor Morton to send to Louisville any troops in Indiana. Will ask Governor Yates to send troops to Columbus, if any are still in his State.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Nashville, Tenn.:

General Halleck telegraphs that Columbus, Ky., is threatened,and asks if I cannot send re-enforcements there. Has this, in your opinion, any connection with the reported movement of the enemy against Gallatin and Gainesborough?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
