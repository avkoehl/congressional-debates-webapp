of trade—that a profitable channel of enterprise al
ways, for a time, tempts adverturers into it, until
its profits, are brought down to the level of other
pursuits, and for a time below them—especially
when capital is Suddcnl) re'eased from other pur-
suits, and lei unproductive in the ha ids. of its ov\ n-
ers, we need not doubt that much oí tne o< ei-bank-
jng of this country has resulted from the redemp-
tion of the public debt Having, as I think, ac-
quitted the late administration of the charge of pro-
ducing the banking niniia which his manifested
itself withm the last seven )eais, 1 «ill proceed
to mciuire into the immediate causes wh ch hate
produced the repulsion un 'er which the urantrj is
now laboring Whale er may be the opinions of
others, I hav e no doubt mat this rev ahion has been
occasioned by th  headless extension of ciedit in
every form m vh ch credit mav be cmplo}ed, a^
by bank issues, bills of exchange, &o
It mav be impossible not only to ascertain what
is the amou it of the currency of a country, but
whatshmld belts propoition to thecommerc of
that country, nor is it at all ¡material to my pur
pose, in regard to the prespnt inquiry that mdividu
a! or community has ovei-ti adea w hich can nut meet
its engagements Will any one controveit this
proposition7 If it be nioontiov<ntible, and I be-
lieve it to be «o, have the banks been guilty i f ovei-
bankmg, and the n erchants of over Hading'
The present condition of the country can answei
fins question With a large balance of foreign
debt unsat sfied, iid for which tbeie are no pre-
sent means of satisfaction, who can deny that the
merchants have over-Haded'—and aie the banks
in a better condmon' How stood the accounts of
the late deposite banks as to immediate means and
liabilities on the loth of August' Tney show im-
mediate liabilities to the amount of one hundied
and four mill ons of do his, and in?mediae means
to the amoim' of bu  foit}-/ou milh i an I about
eight hundred and nine tnousand do lars, of which
only ten millions fit e hundred and eighty thousand
dolíais and a fraction was in specie In the gene-
ral account of means and labilities, it is true that
a large amount of these obligations are to the
s'ockholders, but the fact of the great dispropor-
tion between their discounts <>nd circulation, shows
conclusive!} tnat much of the stock itself has been
withdrawn from them, and exists in mere ciedit m
the notes of the stockholders, thus show mg that the
supposed capital of the banks 1  credit, and not i
monej Eut if ev dence is Ranting, as cone usive
as evidence can be, to p oie t íat the hanl s hat e
over-traded, it is found in the fat t, that they can
^got redeem their p omises, ai d at best are only able
to exchange one promts" ior another For my
part, I can not conceive how any advocate of the
banks can pretend that they have not over-traded
to an enormous extent, without indirectly chaigmg
them v/idi deliberate and wilful fraud upon the
public It may be s-nd that tne banks are unable
to meet their engagements because their debtors are
unable to pay them But this only carnps us one
step further to the conc'us on, that the whole coun
try has over-traded—a fact of which I have not the
smallest doubt I n ght h ve shown ti e enormous
disproportion beiw een the value oí our exports and
imports for the tvo or thiee years ending witn the
year 1836, of the immense su ns ves ed m public
lands, th" dtspiopo tion be'w "en the pnces of vari-
ous species of propert} and the annual piofi s of
such property , but 1 h"ve chos n to save the com-
mittee and my e1 «uch details, and only to pre-
sent mcontrovei ub e f arts, estab' sh ng, bey otia
the sirdow of doubt, that tne banks have over-
banked, and the traders have < vci-traded What
has stimulated O all "lis is the moulinate

of the people So fa as the Gm ernment can in-

subjects, its relief w ill if ch the lenotest íamifica-

can deny it—telief to the importers w ill be fell by
the humblest and íemotest c¡u7*n of this gieat Re-
public, to whom metcantilc cied t has been extend-
ed And, although indulgence to the suspended
depostie banks «ill not reacn to so wide an qz ent,
it will relieve those who stand in the gicatest need
of relief Thus, the passage of the bills to exterd
indulgence on duty bonds, and to give tune to the
banks gradually to call m their dues from their
debtors, « ill extend rebel *o a number of our em-
banassed lellovv-citizens, which no one is ab'e to
estimate And here T maj be permitted to reply
to the remarl s of mi honorable fn°nd fiom South
Carolina, in whicn he endeavored to contrast the
conduct of the British Government, ill 1797,
m a pmod of commercial distress, with that
of his own Government, in th s season ofpres
sure and embarrassment My honotable friend
told us that the pres ure in Gieat Brita n was re-
lieved, at the period referí ed to, bj the is ue of no
more thpn twelve millions of exchequer bills And
if be has attended to the state of tne monej mar-
ket at N'w York, he must know that it has been
decidedly improved even by the passage of
the bills which have come down from the Senate,
especially those giving in('nl°-ence on dutv bonds,
and authormng the issue of Trc ry notes espe-
cially the latter How, th°n, can 1 e extol the
British Government, and condemn 1 s own foi
adopting a measure of the same cha actor' What
distinction can be drawn between exchequer bills
in the one case, and Treasury notes in the other,
m their effects, I am at a loss to discovei I pass
over the question, whether or not there is, or soon
will be, a deficit m the Treasury To me it seems
to be a question on which there can be but one
opinion tr at there is such a deficit, and that it can
only be met by using the ciedit of the Government
Whether it is best to use it in the fonn of Treasury
notes, or by authorizing a loan m the ordinary way,
is a matter of indifference, as it respects the obli-
gations which will be con ractea oy the Govern-
ment Nor am I sufBcien ly_ versed in questiors
of finance to sa} vv hich v. ill Le the prefeiable mode
But, to my mind, the mos>t immediate and dupctis
the course best suited to the present wants of the
Government, and that is to issue Treasury notes
Nor can it be of any very greit con equmce
whether th^y are hoarded oi go into genenl circu-
lation In either case, they will displace an equal
amount of the present circulating medium, driving
it out of, or into cntulilnn, as tney mav be la d
up, or otb°nuse, and if we mav be permitted to
1 )ok fo-vard to their final effect, thev will contri-
bute, at n> di tant dtv most mat r ally, to restore
a sounr1 cnriency Situate 1 as I vas during the
discussion °f the. b 11 to postpone the to j- h instil
ment of denos te with 'he States, connected, as it
is, with trie bis y t tobe disposed of, I may be
permitted, m the ¡at tude giv en to the d bate, to
say a word or two upon it
Tne period of making that deposite was at hand,
the Tieasury had not the means or making it, nor
cou'd they be commanded without ci eating a pub-
lic debt Thus rccssirly arose th  question,
whether Congress had tie power to tat tne people
to enable it to ra se a fund to deposite m the
'reasJ>\,es of the States' To my mind, the answer
was cleat, i iat the Gonsti ution had conferred no
uch power upon us If it hüd, the poi cy mi^ht
well be dc ubled of taxing t>e p op e v ith one hand,
and leturnng the monev so ia =ed ' nh trie other,

I have already advei ed to tl c cau es \vh ch led
to the present embarrassments of this country, t1--*
ov°i-banking and over trading which have charac-
terized ns business transactions for the last two or
three years But as these were the remote, whn
w as the efficient ot proximate cause of the pres -
reviKion both m Great Britain and America 1
answer, the course adopted by the bank of England
when called upon to prop the failing credit of
American hoases so called, but English bankers,
who h/d gone eiuimously b"vond tneir means in
the acceptance of d. afts from this countiy for which
the owners had furnished no fund of redemption
whatsoever That measure of tne bank not only
destroyed lor the lime the creoit of the ovvneis of
the bills le'e-ied to, but shook American credit to
its foundation, and lesultcd in the immediate and
ruinous fall in the puce of the great staple of our
country, by which the means of Imencan mer-
chants were rtduoed to almost one-half the amount
of their value at the time their debts were contract-
ed This being the fact, which none can question,
is it wonderful (hat eoustemation and rain spread
over the land' If any one can doubt the effect of
that measure of the bank, m applying the match
wlmh has produced this mighty explosion, he is a
much greater sceptic than I am If any other proof
was wanting beside open and apparent connection < f
the cause and its effect, it will be found nt the exist-
ing state of the money market iu Great Britain^
Shortly after the Bank of England had, intentionally
oi unintentionally, I shall not slop to inquire,
knocked down the price of cotton, she came for-
waid to sustain the piivate bankers who had
involved themselves by then American accep-
tances, the London money market became easy,
and we art now told that money is a diug there,
and can be obtained on uaquestionable security for
th>-ee and a half per cent per annum, and probably
much lower Thus am I sustained m the assertion
that tl e. lmme hate and efficiei t Ciase- "1 'he pre-
sent peeumaiy condition of this countiy, was Ihe
conduct of the Bank of England towards the
British acceptors of American bills of excha,ngeV
and the fall of cotton, which was produced by it
Panic, then, on the part of that bank, or a motive-
so much worse that I will not impute it, was the
match that lighted up this tremendous explosion
Nor was a similar course in this country without
its instrumentality, if vyc have been conectiy
infoi med—that from first to last there were million 
of idle c-pital m New York, Boston, and other
cit l% which remaned idle for want of that confi-
dnnce betu Len man and man which is the lrfe-blorft
of credit m everj country m the world I have al-
ready stated whatmeasures might, and as I supposed
would, be adopted by Congress for the relief of tie
countiy in the present extraordinary emergency
extension of time on duty bonds, and reasonable
indulgence to the suspended deposHe banks.
But can no measmes be adopted as preventives
pgainst the recomence of a similar calamity? 1
th uk there can, and that they are to be found, not
in the charter of a national bank, but in the mea
suics proposed for ultimately collecting the public
dues m tl e only medium recognise I by the Consti-
tutio i as money and m changing the mode of
1 eeping tue public revenue But I may be asked,
why not establish a national bank? I answei,
fiist not only because the Constitution confers no
power to do so, either m terms or rational in-
ference, but its history forbids the implication
of it in the fact that the federal convention
was a<-ked to confer it, and it refused pe-
remptorily to do so I will not so far msiilt the
cornm ttee as to go over the argument to shew hew
far any doubt ai i--ing upon the face of an instru-
B ent s to be =ettled by a reference to its history,
tnenett paee I answer, that if the power h d
b^en exp ici 'v giacted in the Constitution, it wou'd
be inexpedient to exerciSt it it would be ine\:pe->
d eit, first, because the whole mstory of the late
r it ir il bank, and its successor, the United St ite^
