Can steamers be procured in Philadelphia? If so charter and dispatch to Fort Delaware at once. Reply immediately.

Are there any chartered steamers in Baltimore that you can dispatch to Fort Delaware this afternoon to transport prisoners of war from thence to James River? If not are there any that you can charter for the purpose? Reply by telegram at once how many of either kind can be started.

Captain GRIER TALLMADGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army, Fort Monroe, Va.:

How many steamers can be spared from Fort Monroe to transport prisoners of war from Fort Delaware to James River to start at once on notice being given? Is the Vanderbilt at Fort Monroe and ready for sea? Answer by telegraph as soon as this dispatch is received.

E. S. SIBLEY,

Brevet Colonel, U. S. Army, and Deputy Quartermaster-General.

FORT MONROE, July 27, 1862.

General MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

There are now three steamers here capable of bringing from Fort Delaware to this place 2,700 prisoners. Coatzacoalcos 900, Atlantic 900 and Merrimac 900. The Coatzacoalcos can go on up James River. The other two can transfer their passengers here to river boats. The above estimate is rather under than over. The Vanderbilt has not yet returned from New York.

GRIER TALLMADGE,

Assistant Quartermaster.
