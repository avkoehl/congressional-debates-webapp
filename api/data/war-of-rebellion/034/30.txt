this place, and I am making preparations to receive them. Lieutenant Colonel Prather with a part of his cavalry is still skirmishing with them.

HEADQUARTERS CHALMERS' BRIGADE,Near Unionville, Tenn., February 13, 1863.

After waiting in position for some time, expecting the enemy to advance, and until, in fact, they were within half a mile of us, I was informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Prahter that they were falling back. I advanced my command, but being satisfied that they were retreating to Eagleville, and not being able to get within reach of them, I am withdrawing my command to its former position.

I am, major, your obedient servant,

W. F. TUCKER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

FEBRUARY 1-2, 1863.-Reconnaissance to Franklin and Brentwood, Tenn.

Report of Brigadier General James B. Steedman, U. S. Army, commanding Third Division, Fourteenth Army Corps.

WILSON'S PIKE, SIX MILES FROM FRANKLIN,

February 2, 1863.

COLONEL: My advance, two companies of the First East Tennessee Cavalry, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel [J. P.] Brownlow, had gone forward before the order directing me to reconnoiter in the direction of Brentwood reached me. Colonel Brownlow entered Franklin at 9 o'clock last night, and learned that the enemy had gone in the direction of Harpeth Shoals. The colonel lost 1 man killed by the enemy's rear guard. He captured 1 captain and 1 private of Starnes' command. I move this morning 7 o'clock in the direction of Brentwood. For some reason, to me inexplicable, Colonel [J. T.] wilder did not report to me, and waiting for him and Colonel [J. T.] Croxton, after being satisfied Wilder was not coming, to get here, with the storm rendering the roads almost impassable, delayed me twenty-four hours. But for the unavoidable delay, I would have been in Franklin in time enough to attack the enemy, which I intended to do. I will, unless otherwise ordered, after making the reconnaissance directed in my last order, return to may camp on the Nolensville pike, at the crossing of Mill Creek, and furnish to Colonel [W. P.] Innes whatever aid he may require on the bridges.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Brigadier-General, Third Division.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
