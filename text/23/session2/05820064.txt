Again, (p 311 )
" The Fust Consul had followed, with i lively
' interest, the piogicss of this negotiation It
' will be recollected that he hid mentioned fif y
' millions as the puce which he had put on the
' cession and it miy well bo bekeved that he did
' notcxpecito obtnn so laigcasum He learned
' tl at eighty milhons had been agieed on but that
' thev weie leduced to sixty by the icduction
' stipulated to be pievio isly nude for the settle-
' nent of the debt due by Prince to the Amen
'cans Then foigettmn-, ot ieignnig to foigei,
' the consent that he had given, he said with vi
' vacity to the Tienelí Mmistei—'I would tint
' these tvvi nty millions be paid into theTieasury
' Who h is iutnon7ed you to dispose of the
' money of the State' "Ilie nshts of the clum
' mts cannot come befon, oui own ' This fust
'excitement was calmed os he was brought to
'leeollect that he hid previously consented to
' tie it foi a much smallei sum th m the Tieasuiy
'would icceive, without including the twenty
' millions indemnity for the prizes ' It is Hue,'
' ho said, ' the negotiation does notlea\e one my-
' thing to des ie sixty millions for m occupation
' that will not, peihaps, last but a dav ' I would

If wc lcgaid the statement of \1 Maibois as
containing the ficts, we must believe it to be the
m i st cii mc in th woild that the American
meieh mts ever did receive the indemnity ot
twenty millions of flanes ISanoleon Bonapaite,
to the last mom m of his life, while hi was at wai
with the lest of Euiope, would not have taken
tint sum out of his tieasuiy to pay these claims
Sixtj millions ot flanes, th sum paid into the
Fie ne Ii tic isu y, wasai' Pon ipaitc would have
aisked foi Louisnna Tine twenty millions paid
was so much money of the Ameucan people gen
eiously mil gratuitously bestowed by then Gov-
ernment, toi which the undeiwnteis, and otheis
who piofited by the boon, an sea cely disposed
to think us and they would even wink this sum
out ef sight in their lageuiess to giasp moie foi
cl tuns whose foundation, to say the least, is ex
tiemely doubtful
But, Mi Picsident, if thcic was the least roo n
to doubt tint wu h id put an cud to all right of
md mnity fiom Fiance, it will be easy to show
th it the United St tes iicvei fust xulated an) en
gagement u ith Prance in a mintici that claimed
ñ im us an indemnity
I «ie it asseited in a nt wspaper of th s citj,
copied fiom a Boston nevvspap r, cxpicssmg the
feelings, piobibly, of some of those interested in
these clums, that Unity foui yeais ago oui own
Government sold to the Fiench Goiemment a gieat
mioiint ot clums of oui own citizens on Funce
foi indemnity, and received pay foi them, and
released Fi nice fi oui ill obh0 lfions to pay the
cKiin mts, whose demands weie acknowledged to
be just by both nations
In the fiist place, I deny that this Goveiment
i ver sold ti the Fiench Government the claims
of oui citizens This Government had done its
whole duty to the claimants—it Ind piessed the
cl limb as far and as long as it was bound to do,
and if, it length, it agieed to picss them no
fmthei, it wis to pioiuie indemnity, not for
itselt, but for otln rs, and mmy of the selfsame
clum au's, which i idemnity otherwise would
h ive been uttetly hopi less, and lost to them foi
evci
To the declaiation, that this Government ie
ccived piyment foi these cl inns, I inswer that
if no cl urns of citizens of the Umteel States
amiuit Piance had existed, it is quite certain the
United States would have proeur d as good a            «
tieaty with Iiance as that of the convention of
Septembei 30, 1800 and that lionet would hive
laid in no claim wh never for an alleged mfiac-
tion of prior tieati s on oui part
It is said these demands weie acknowledged to
be just by both nations The Ciuai telly Review
says "Ihe Trench Government did not deny
• too justice of these demands, they even offeied
' to make arrangements to compensate the los&es,
' but they had claims upon the Government of
'the United Stites, which they insisted upon
' taking into consideration, and they íefused to
