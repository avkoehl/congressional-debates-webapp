Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, Washington:

GENERAL: From what I can learn, Colonel Ford will be able to convince the Secretary of War that he is not responsible for the capitulation at Harper's Ferry; if so, as his services are very necessary to his regiment, I hope the Secretary will give the case an early decision, and, if thought compatible with the good of the service to release Colonel Ford, that he will be ordered at once to join his regiment.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The conspicuous conduct of Captain B. F. Davis, First Cavalry, in the management of the withdrawal of the cavalry from Harper's Ferry at the surrender of that place, merits the special notice of the Government. I recommend him for the brevet of major.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ANNAPOLIS, MD., September 23, 1862.

GENERAL-IN-CHIEF:

General Julius White is in Baltimore. I have requested General Wool to arrest him and send him to Washington. The brigade commanders are Colonels D'Utassy, Trimble, Ford, and Ward. The first three named will be arrested. The last is the colonel of the Twelfth New York, and is in that city. The commanders of regiments are Colonels Segoine, Sammon, Cameron, Stannard, Sherrill, Maulsby, Willard, and Banning; Lieutenant-Colonels Hixon, Andross, Downey, and Satterlee, and Major Hildebrandt. Satterlee went to New York with his regiment (the Twelfth). From what I have learned, the regimental commanders were not consulted in regard to the surrender of Harper's Ferry. I will see each one of them. Colonel Cameron says there was not a formal consultation held, to his knowledge.
