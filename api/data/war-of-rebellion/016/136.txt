and the parties under their charge, during the receipt operations of this command against the enemy and the arrangement with him at Cedar Mountain.

Second Lieutenant Joseph H. Spencer, Second Minnesota Volunteers, who during this period was stationed on Thoroughfare Mountain, overlooking the camp of the enemy, was at one time driven with his party from that post by a regiment of rebel cavalry, but returned thereto at great personal risk and re-established his station within two hours thereafter. The information furnished by him from station was of an important nature, and assisted materially in the prosecution of operations.

First Lieutenant Brooks, Fourth Vermont Volunteers, and First Lieutenant Adams, Sixty-sixth New York Volunteers, during the entire action on Cedar Mountain were posted on the field of battle. First Lieutenant E. C. Pierce, Third Maine Volunteers, stationed at Culpeper, and First Lieutenant Wilson, Fifth Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, by their energy and universal attention to duty during this time in furnishing and receiving signal messages, rendered valuable service to the major-general commanding the army.
