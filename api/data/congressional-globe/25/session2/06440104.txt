APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 183S 
25th Cong •••2nd Sess.
Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Hubbard.
readily see that this may be partially effected by
State or Federal legislation   This important ob-
ject the proposed amendment is calculated to de-
feat This important object the bill is intended to
accomplish
The Senatoi from Virginia has intended «o to
draw his amendment, as to exempt it from the
odious objection " that %t tends to increase Exe-
cutive pah onage " Take the deposite act of 1836,
and can any one say that thepower therein conferred
upon the Executive, does not necessarily secure
ten times the influence and the pationage which
the bill reported from the Committee on Finance
becures,1 The whole power of selecting the banks
of deposite in every State and Territory of this
Union for the safe-keeping of the public money ,is ex-
pressly vested in the Executive That act gave
to him the disposition and control of all the public
money, which shall come into the hands of col-
lector-, and receivers The whole amount of the
revenues of the Government may be used by the
Executive to build up and sustain State institu-
tions favorable to Executive policy
What is Executive patronage, which has been
the subject of so much remark' Is it any thing more
or less than the power which the Executive pos-
ases by vntue of law, and which power he may
exercise to advance his own purposes—to accom-
plish his own ends'!
The Executive has the power to fill the million
of offices undei this Government by appointment,
some with, and some without, the approbation of
the Senate This is an influence which he may
exert to cairy out his policy This is Executive
patronage Under the act of 1836, exclusive con-
trol is given to him ovei the funds of the country,
so far as to select the places for their deposite, safe-
keeping, and disbursement. This is a power
which may be exercised to secure a political ad-
vantage, or to eflfect some particular policy, and
this is Executive patronage. And what power has
the Executive in relation to this matter, secured to
him by the amendment proposed to the bill now
before the Senate, by the Senator from Virginia''
He has,, as he had under the act of 1836, the power
of selecting each bank of deposite, but it ib true
that such a selection is to have no effect until it
shall be approved by the resolution of both Houses
of Congress The great source of political power
rests in the people, and the exercise of that power,
which shall elevite to the Presidency any individu-
al, will ordinarily secure a Senate ind a House of
Representatives in perfect accordance with the
Executive II such should be the fact, the Admi-
nistration power and influence, under the proposed
amendment, would be fully equal to the Executive
power under the act of 1836, and this same power
might be exercised by the Executive and legisla-
tive branches of the Government m furtherance of
great political objects—to accomplish important
political purposes, and this is what I suppose
would be called Administration patronage But
should it so happen that there should, for the time,
exist no unison of political feeling between tne
Executive and either branch of Congress, as I have
before observed, the selection of the deposite banks
would lead to great embarrassment and confusion
m the fiscal operations of the Government How
stands this matter under the bill emanating from
the Committee on Finance'! It seems to me, Ml
President, to be free from the charge "of adding to
Executive patronage"—of increasing Executive influ-
ence It is true that some half dozen officers are
to be appointed by the Executive, with the appro-
bation of the Senate, to perform duties enjoined by
the bill itself, and this is, all The Executive has
no power to select a single place for the deposite of
the public money He has no authority, in any
way, or in any manner, to control a single dollar
of the Government funds under this bill He is
entirely bereft of all the power, the patronage, the
influence, secured to him by the act of 18^6, and
again pioposed to be conferred by the amendment
of the Senator from Virginia What power has
the Executive oxer the public money more than
he enjoyed during the existence of the Bank of
the United States'! Not any
Not a dollar then could be, nor can a dollar «n-
4>r this Ml be? drawn fiom the Treasury but in
consequence of appropriations made by law
Here, then, is the bsg i nmng and the end of the Execu-
ttve patronage, as secured by this bill In the ne-
cessary execution of the measure, there is no power
m the Executive to select places for the deposite of
the public money—there is no power m the Execu-
tive to control the public lunds—they are put be-
yond the reach of any officer of the Government,
the bill itself makes it a high misdemeanor for any
oflicer to mike use of the public money for any
purpose whatever, and subjects offenders to the
severe but just punishment of fine and imprison-
ment Talk not, then, of the increased pationage
of the Executive, by way of objection to this bill,
there is not a public act upon your statute-book
whiph is not as obnoxious to the charge "of in-
creasing Executive patronage" as the bill before us
If the proposed rneasuic should become a law, it
must be executed, but how or where the Executive
can possibly derive any political advantage by its
execution, I have not been able to discover The
bill authorizes the E\ecutive not only to appoint
Receivers General, but it also gives authority foi
the appointment ot commissioners, to make exami-
nations periodically, as the Serreta)y shall duect,
ami it also pioudes for the employment of clerks,
not exceeding the number of ten, and at a salary
not exceeding foi each eight hundred dollars. How,
then, ib the appomtmsnt of fouiReceiveis General,
the occasional employment oí a few commissioners
to examine into the doings of these public officers,
and the permanent employment, also, of ten clerks,
leqmrmg in the whole the probable annual expen-
diture of twenty-five thousand dollars, giving to
the Executive of this Government such an increase
of patronage and official influence as even to put
m jeopardy the continuance of our free institutions?
If, sir, the hill now before the Senate is not ob-
noxious to any stronger and more substantial ob-
jections, then indeed may the committee consider
themselves pcculiaily fortunate in presenting for
consideration so perfect and so faultless a measure
The Senatoi from Virginia, in piesentmg his
amendment, has looked to the benefit it would con-
fer upon the local banks 1 will not say that he had
a single] eye to the interest of those institutions—
that, in submitting his pioposition, relief to them
from existing embarrassment was his exclusive purpose
But those oí us who were favored with the oppor-
tunity of hearing his able argument, cannot doubt
that this was an important item m the account It
mav be well to examine this matter Will the
adoption of the proposed amendment afford to the
local banks any substantial relief, or give to them
any permanent piotecuon? Will it yield to the
sound and responsible moneyed institutions of the
States any essential, any ihsiraUebentfiÚ No, sir-
no. I have satisfied my own mind, from the best
reflection which I could give to this measurp, that
the contemplated re-union between the Government
and the banks, as proposed, is an event not to be
wished for by those banks who would consult their
own true inteiest, and the tiue interests of their
customers Tnat this connection is opposed to that
steady and regular course of operation, which dis-
tinguishes the business tiansactious ot every solvent
and well regulated banking institution in our
countrj
I will picsent to the Senate my own views, my
own reflections, with reference to this particular
mallei Mv proposition is, that the sound banks
of the States ml! derive no advantage from the con-
nection—by mingling their lunds with the iunds of
the Government, by an unre trained use of those
joint funds m their banking operations
The first idea which must occur to every mind
is, that the great uncertainty as to the amount of
the public funds which may remain in deposite,
and the great uncertainty rs to the duration of the
public deposites, renders all appropriation of the
Government fund  to the use of the deposite banks,
a most hazards us and dangerous operation to the
banks themselves
If, Mr. President, a selected bank should receive,
m general deposite of the public lunds, one hun-
dred thousand dollars at a given day—no intima-
tion, no suggestion, when the deposite would be
withdrawn—the fact must be wholly unknown to
the department charged with the custody and dis-
bursement of the public funds. No man can fore-
see what sums may be required, and when, they
may be wanted, to carry on the operations of the
Government in pursuance of the general appropria-
tions made by Congress—no public officer can
judge at whit particular period a portion of the
public funds may be required even to meet a
special appropnaüon. The time of making these
general and special expenditures depends upon a
thousand contingencies, wholly without the control
of the Treasury Department
This sum, then, thus deposited, may remain
months uncalled for, it may be demanded within
a single week The bank, however, tempted by
the love of gam, will pioceed at once to discount
upon the strength of this deposite Any man con-
versant with banking operations, must admit that
such would be the practice It is one of the
sources of profit which invariably enters into the
calculation of those charged with the direction of
these institutions What are the amount of depo-
sites on hand'' to what extent can these deposites
be safely used' are questions which are submitted
to and determined by every board of bank duec-
tors , and the uncertainty as to the continuance of
Government deposites, to which I have referred,
would not deter the managers-of these banks to ex-
tend their line of discounts to the lull amount of
the deposite This has been the lesson of expe-
rience taught us fiom recent connection with these
institutions These are facts contained by the ob-
servation of men conversant with the subject.
What, then, would be the effect of such a proceed-
ing upon the banks, if the Government should call
for the sum m deposite within a single week after
the deposite shall have been made? The bank has
loaned to its customers the one hundred thousand
dollars, upon its usual terms, and upon the strength
ol this very deposite The bank must, however,
meet the draft, it has the money of the Govern-
ment, it cannot, without dishonor, shift its respon-
sibility Its course is plain, payment is demanded,
and payment must be made
Will any one say to me, that the case I have
stated, would tend to advance the interests of the
bank'! Would it not necessarily bring upon the in-
stitution certain embarrassment—would it not so
increase its ordinary liabilities, as to expose its own
ciedit to hazard' Banks must depend on public
confidence lor their support Their credit rests on
popular opinion, and a single failure to meet with
the utmost promptness and punctuality a liability,
would awaken suspicion—excite doubts and
fears—produce a panic, and ¡ rostíate the institu-
tion In the case I have supposed, the means oí
the bank may be undoubted, its perfect ability to
meet ultimately every engagement may be unques-
tioned, but the sudden and extraordinary contraction
of its circulation to the amount of a hundred thousand
dollars, is of itself a circumstance well calculated
to create distrust The bank must incur an actua
loss in the case I have stated And so great is the
uncertainty m amount and in time which must in-
evitably attend all Government deposites, that no
well conducted bank, regarding its own interests
and the interest of its friends, would desire a revi-
val of that policy
I cargiot, sir, more peifectly illustrate my own
views upon this subject, than by referring to the
course and conduct of the banks selected, under the
act of 1836, in the city of Boston, a«¡ the safe depo
sitones of the public money, and it seems to me that
the effects of this system, as manifested by the
transactions of those institutions, should deter the
Senate at once from giving new life to this policy
1 have said, sir, that the State bank deposite sys-
tem is of no practical advantage to sound and
responsible institutions Take the Merchants
Bank Its chaiacter, being one of the selected in-
stitutions in the city of Boston as a public deposi-
t< n, has been such as to command the public con-
Sdence and to maintain a high credit m the com-
