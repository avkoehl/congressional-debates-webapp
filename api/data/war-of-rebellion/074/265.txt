the river on the 14th and went into position, while our infantry threw up very strong works. Remained here until the 17th, when we started for the Augusta railroad. Struck the road on the 18th and went into position at night. Advanced again the following morning and took up position in Decatur about 4 p. m. Advanced on the 20th, taking up position several times during the day and engaging rebel batteries. At 1 o'clock fired three shells into atlanta at a distance of two miles and a half, the first shells into Atlanta at a distance of two position (under protest) with a range of only ten yards, and in front of our line of works, by order of Brigadier General M. L. Smith. July 22, advanced again, and occupying the works evacuated by the enemy the night previous. I went into position at the extreme right of our division to engage three rebels batteries which were firing at our advancing columns; was ordered to keep up a continuous fire. There was a gap of at least 800 yards between my battery and the First Division, which fact I reported several times. The enemy charged our works about 4 p. m.; was repulsed in my front, but broke through our center, and changing front charged my battery, which I was obliged to leave after spiking the guns, and after all my support had left me. As soon as my battery was recaptured I had the guns unspiked and fired again at the retreating enemy. One of my guns, injured since the 25th of June, burst at the third round. My losses* on that day were very heavy-14 men, 39 horses, 1 limber, ambulance, and harness. Replaced lost horses and harness from Battery A, and had battery in marching order by 9 o'clock the following day. July 27, withdrew the battery and marched all night, with division, to the extreme right of our line; went into position in rear of our line, and advanced into position July 31, firing at the rebel forts and city.

Took up position again in our new line of works August 3, and fired considerable at rebel batteries, rifle and skirmish pits; had 2 men wounded on the 13th. Remained in same position until the night of the 26th, when we withdrew, and, marching all night went into camp August 27. Started again the following day, and went into camp about 2 p. m. on the West Point railroad. Started again on the 30th, and although our infantry was skirmishing continually, marched twelve miles. Battery crossed Flint River about 9 a. m. on the 31st, and went into position to protect the flank; fired considerable at the rebel columns moving and rifle-pits. The enemy charged our line about 4 p. m., moving one gun to the rifle-pits, fired twenty-seven rounds of canister; had 1 man wounded by shell, Private Henry Rahmeyer.

September 1, moved one section to the extreme left of our line to engage the enemy's batteries firing at the Fourteenth Army Corps, which was advancing; lost 1 man killed, Corpl. Frank Whistler. September 2, marched through Jonesborough, following up the enemy who had evacuated the night previous, and went into camp at 6 p. m., in reserve, with the division. September 5, left camp and returned to Jonesborough.

This campaign has been a very severe one on my battery, especially as I started out unprepared, caused by circumstances, and being continually in the field and in position, could not supply my horses with such forage as the country would furnish, and was often without forage altogether.
