I do not believe that Magruder is coming here, or I think we would have heard more of him by this time.

Information has been brought to me from a source which I consider not very reliable, though meaning well, corroborating what you sent me about Magruder; that is, that his force is concentrating on Vermillion Bayou; that it began to arrive yesterday evening, and that it is 20,000 strong. The information which you sent me got out about here, and, after all, it may be the source of this rumor. The idea is, that 1,200 men are to be east of the Teche, and that the main force is to move from Vermillion in this direction. I find that the ditch in front of Olivier's can be easily turned on the left about 1 mile from the bayou. I rather think that their tactics will be to turn us, and make us fall back by that means.

I have sent out to-day for some more guerrillas, said to be on other side of bayou.

To-day 200 cavalry have gone near Vermillion Bayou and encamp there to-night. They sent two parties of 6 men over the bayou, to go to the Texas roads west, and see if they can learn anything of Magruder's movements. I will probably hear of them to-morrow evening.

Another party is down the bayou, on the other side, after guerrillas. I do not know of any point this side of Franklin where a better stand can be made than here. Of course, shall take the best position possible, if the news about Magruder turns out to be true. I only keep about six days' supplies on hand, and can move my whole force, I think, with twelve hours' notice. I cannot credit the Magruder news. But may he not be on the Mississippi River, or rather his force?

The expeditions yesterday were not successful. The parties could not cross the bayou as was expected. They, however, went to Abbe-
