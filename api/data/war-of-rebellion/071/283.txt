Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Lieutenant Colonel M. Brewer, Seventh Michigan, reports, in obedience to your orders, as follows:

I proceed from Camp Stoneman to Beltsville, and some of my scouts have been to the Relay House. I found no enemy in that direction. Bradley Johnson, with about 2,000 mounted men, was on that road yesterday, and moved with his column out on the road near Agricultural College, toward Rockville. Citizens report having seen a few rebel scouts north of the railroad to-day.

A squadron of cavalry attached to this brigade and located near Sumner has, by some unaccountable mistake, gone down the Aqueduct road to Georgetown instead of up it. Will you have it returned as soon as possible?
