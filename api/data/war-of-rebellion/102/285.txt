of the Indian troops serving in this department. The major- general commanding directs me to state that the selection of officers for the new organizations should be made with care and discrimination, having in view their peculiar fitness, and, if possible, experience with Indian troops. The selection when made will be submitted by you to these headquarters for approval of the major- general commanding. All officers now serving with these regiments will be deemed entitled to remain in service unless the public interest will be promoted by mustering out any officer or officers you may designate. in this event they may be mustered out at once upon your order. Officers selected for service may be place temporarily on duty until the action of the War Department can be had upon recommendations for promotions.

Very respectfully,

JOHN LEVERING,
