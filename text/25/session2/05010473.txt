[This bill was to provide for the payment of «tt-
nesses fees to the petitioner, who had be< n brought

passing the bill at once, but objection boing made

The House then went into Committee of the
Whole, and continued the consideration ot
THE INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL
There being not more than twenty tnembeis in
their wats, and while the Chairman was waiting to
call the committee to order,
Mr CALHOUN of Massachusetts slated that
the House in the morning had endeavomd to fit b
day for adjournment, and it was urged that it wa
impossible to adjourn at an early day in July, be"
cause of the pressure of important business, whie h
could not so soon be piopeily disposed of, and he
remarked, that if the recess of an hour and a hall
was virtually to be extended to two hours and
more, and if members would not attend to the busi-
ness of Congress, no adjournment could he had be
fore August He then moved that the committee
rise, and report the fact to tuc House that they
found themselves without a quorum, and made
that motion with a view to move a call of the
House
Ths CHAIR said it was a courtesy usually ex-
tended to members addressing the committee lo
wait for members to come in
Mr HUNTER expressed his readiness to goon,
and he proceeded with and concluded his remarks
in favor oí the bill

pnnte'
Mr MORRlScalled for the leadwgof the paper,
and accordingly the Secietary having read a por-
tion of it,
Mr KING moved to lay it on the table, there
being several expressions in it which he thought
disiespectful, and therefore ought not to be read to
the Senate
Mr NORYELL said he hoped that his friend
from Alabama wetuld, for a moment, withdraw his
motion to lay the memorial on the table. This
paper proceeded from as respectable a body of
gentlemen as any in the country, and he did think
that, as they eonsidcreel themselves to have been
injunously assailed on this floor, they should have
an ( pporiunitj to be heard It %vas true that they
h id u c 1 strot ¿ 1 inguage, but this, under the cn-
cumstanccs, w is natural Let the memorial be
leid, in i then the S< nate might take «hat course
ihiyihou„ht piopcr, is regareled the further dispei-
sition of it By the statement of moneys collected,
it appealed that the stately had received only be
tween 97 OlMI and 28,000 dolíais, of which they
had un «.ted upwards oi $27,000, principally, he
behind, in Pennsylvam i State stocks Between
four and five nundred remained uninvested Ex-
cept what had been allowed to collectors in the dif-
feient States, is commissions for nionejs obtained

ought not to he p<nmnied to be read there
Mr PULSION, w ho just then entered the cham-
ber, remaiked, thai the memorial wa<i fr<)m %ery
respectable persons, who conceived themselves in-
jured by something that transrned on this floor
lie had, on more than one occasion, objected to the
Kception of memorials, because their language was
not respcetlul, and he therefore desired to have it
lead, that he might judge whether it was so > not
It it was a question ot reception, he must hear the
papei it ad before he could vote on it
Mr KING said there was no question of recep-
tion raised The paper was received. His motion
was to lay it on the table, and if the honorable
gentleman wished to know whether it was respect-
ful or not, he could easilj read ¡t at the Secretar) 's
table He had objected to the reading, bet ause the
paper spoke disrespectfully of members of that
body If the paper was laid on the table, any
member ouldmove to take it up, and submit what
propositions he pleased as to the disposition of it.
Mi PRESTON said he would not take upon
himself the responsibility of calling up a paper
which was deemed disrespectful to members of
that body But if it was so, he thought n ought
to be called up, in older to be disposed of m a
proper manner.
Mr. SEVIER observed that this day was set
apart for the consideration of private land claim',
and he hoped it would not be consumed as yester-
day was in debate The matter complained of by
these individuals had been published m the public
newspapers, and he presumed the editors would
have no objection to insert their reply It was a
matter with which the Senate had nothing to do,
and he, therefore, moved to lay it on the table
This motion was c irned
