Colonel John Spencer, Receiver, Fort Wayne
This is not only a great falling off from the
tone of the other letters of the Secretary, but
eeems to be tfn encouragement to the receiver in
writing the following lettei •
Receiver's Office, Port Watnl,
October 27, 1836

deposit bank ^101,000, in silver, there to remain until J

This bold avowal of sending a large portion of
the public money by other hands, and awaiting
himself to unite with Ins Demociattc fuends at
the j esidcniial election, does not appear to have
been tin cause of complaint on the part of the
Secretary
And hcie, sit, is his answci to Governor Hen-
ducks.
Treasury Dt partmtnt, Septcnila 7, 1816
Sir Your letter ot the list ultimo is íeceived and I am
hippy to uiloi in you that Mr spencer's explanations have
been such, tint he will probably oontiniu in ofliee
I am, very respectlully, your obidieot servint,

Is this  not willful,  base   ol íual  conuption?
Shaving with the public mom y uusmcie " nieg-
ulnnly,"and'< impiopei piacn < s"ihiue piov< d,
admitted, rcpoiled, became "unfounded imputa-
tions" as soon ns a political paiusui whispeicd,
' bctti r It t it be'"   ¡sir, these «mils ought to be
inscribid over the doors of the Tioasmy Depnit
ment, and  to be biandid,  like Cam's infamy,
upon the loichead of Levi Woodbuiy—" In tlei
ct it be'"    Sil, this tmbiaces nil yout   pttnci
pics anil piactices in respect to mvi sti^ation of
fraud, embezzlement, coiruption,and oíhcml mal
vcrsntion for years     Tliese woids convcited of
a sudden the Sectetaiy's fiowns and threats into
the clearest perception of •' difficulties" and the
cliarest pioofs into "unfounded imputations "
After this, what should be thought of this Secte-
tary's dt nunciation of any chaiges as " unfound
ed imputations'"
Sir, 1 will lead no more of these cases, these
few I have given as specimens are not the gtavest
or the last of foity or fifty I can enumerate In
addition to tliese I could show you facts in the
instances of Lewis, Alsbuty, Dickson, Steilmg,
.Sheldon, Rogéis, Taylor, Ryland, Allen, Haw-
kins, Blackburn, Cailin, Owens, Cannon, M J
Allen, Ilutchtns, Benson, Holleman, Mitchell,
McCarty, Simpson, Hays, Skinner, Blakely,
McRobcris, and numerous others, " too tedious
to mention," all going to the same point—official
neglect, violation of law and duty, and corrupt
administration All going to show more—that
the losses have all occuned by failure to deposit in
tanks, and by leaving moneys in the handi of
sub-Treasurers And more still—that, notwith-
standing the pretensions set up m the Pies dent's
message to this session, this Administi ition is
guilty beyond all former examples of'' the impro-
priety of diverting public money to pmate purposes ''
No, sir, I will wade through no more of these
cases I come at last to that of Samuel Swart-
wout, the largest, though not the last of the list
Samuel Swaitwout went out of office the 29th
of Match, abscoi tied on the 16th of August, and
was not proceeded against until the month of No-
vember, 1838 How does the Secretary account
for this delay?
According to the report to this House, Swart-
wout's last return, March 28, 1838, showed a
balance against him amounting to the sum of
§201,09G 40
Lettei of Swartwout to Secretary, dated April
13, states that he holds this sum subject to sun
dry sui/s at law thenpendmg to recovei back duties
Letter from Woodbury to Swartwout, April
16, hopes that Swartwout will deposit one half of
that amount to the credit of the United States.
Letter from Woodbury to Comptroller Baiker,
April 16, would thank him to have Swaitwout's
accounts settled.
And heie, su, you must permit me to digress
a moment to show you a piece of Mr Secretary's
chicanery in the numbenng of this last letter
You will peiceive thatit is dated the 16th of April,
prior in date to Swartwout's excuses contained in
his letter, and those of Puce of the 20th,21st, and
25th of April, yet, in the Secretary's report, page
3, it is refeired to as if subsequent to those three
lettei s of later date This is some of Mr Wood-
bury's obfuscation, some of his muddy water to
escape by. It is important, and you would not
obsctve the effect of tins upon a hasty reading
Yon will see the effect directly
The next letter in the senes is that of Baiker,
(he Comptrollei, to Miller, the Tirst Auditoi,
dated Apnl 17, requesting him to settle the ac-
counts of Swaitwout
Lettei of Barker to Swartwout, dated April 17,
íequests him to retuin his accounts to the Fust
Auduot
Letter fiom Woodbury to Barker, dated April
18, would thunkhun to call on the Solicitor, to get
fiom the disttict attorney (asks Tom to call on
Dick to get fiom Harry ') in New York (Price)
a list of the suits pending against Swaitwout for
leturn duties, and their amount, etc , indoised
with the same request to the Solicitor
Now, this letter, you will observe, was written
in obvious reference to Swartwout's of the 13th
of Apnl, giving these suits pending as excuse foi
retaining the balance in his hands of $201,000
The next letttr is from Swartwout to Wood
buiy, dated the 21st, in ri ply to Woodbury's lot
tci of the 16th, inclosing one fiom Puce, dated
the 20th, showing his individual liability for judg
ments on piotests, and stating that the notices of
piotcsts wcie estimated at between two and three
iuindied thousand dolíais
Woodbui y then, in a letter to Barkei, dated April
23, ícfcis Swaitwout's letter to him, and suggests
that Swaitwout should furnish Hoyt,his success
oi, with funds to meet íefunded duties paid under
piotcst
Baikei, by letter to Swartwout, dated 24th of
Apnl, states his of the 21st had been referred to
him, and that it was necessary he should so fui-
nisli Hoyt with funds
Baiker to Swaitwout, Apnl the 26th, requests
him to íendei his accounts to the First Auditor
Gilpin, the Solicitor, in a letter to Barker, Apnl
the 27th, inclosing Puce's letter, as district attor-
ney, in lcply to the Secretary's, of the 18th of
Apnl, showing the lists of suits This letter of
Price, dated the 25th of April, to Gilpin, shows
that thcie were but two suits pending undecided—
damages in one $2,000, in the other $,158 80, and
the amount of unsatisfied judgments to be but
$5,561 63, the whole amount for which Swart-
wout was individually liable but $7,720 43 And,
furthei, that there weie one hundred and fifteen
protests, unceitam in amount, "¡mi, by examina-
tion of invoices and appiaisements at customhouse,
the amount of each claim could bet eadily ascertained ''
He adds
" I will apply to the present collector (Hoyt) for such
stitement, and transmit it to you, upon my receipt thereof
Itwill, however, require several days to prepare suchadoc
ument "
Now, sir, in this letter we see that Swaitwout's
excuse for retaining this laige balance of $201,000
to meet $7,000 was false, or could readily be made
to appear true or false m a period not exceeding,
at most, " scieialdays " Were any steps taken
to asceitam the amount of these piotests' None
And, sa, here I bung your attention to the letter
of Woodbuiy, dated April the 16th, numbered 9,
and to his report Mark you, sir, page 3, he
sajs
" A further inquiry into the case was, however, immp
diately instituted by me, through the First Comptroller and
Solicitor of the Treasury It terminated m an impresnon
that the facts and the law as to suits and piote ts might
lu^tify a short delay in the adjustment See copies ot letters
No  0 to 8," &e
The letteis Nos 6 to 8 in his íeport, are his
of th> 18th of April, Gilpin's of the 27th of April,
and Puce's of the 25th of April In the very next
parngtaph of his report he adds*
' But the Comptroller was, notwithstanding, directed to
bnn^ Mr Swaitwout's accounts to an ear/i/settlement, and
to have i prompt payment made of whatever amount should
appeal to be not m doubt or controversy "
Now, would not any one suppose, from this
report, in this connection, that this dnection to
the Comptroller was given subsequently to the date
of this letter fiom Price, of the 25th, falsifying
Swartwout's of the 16th The Secretary intended
to create such an impiession, but upon referring
to the No 9 he cites, you find that it is his old
letter of April 16, prior in date to all this corre-
spondence with Barker, Gilpin, and Puce1
So fai, then, from his taking any steps after
this falsification of Swaitwout's excuses for ie-
taining so laige a balance, you find no step what-
evci until a letter from Wolf, the Comptroller, to
Swaitwout, dated June 13th, nearly two months
after Puce's of the 25th, stating that upon an ad-
justment of his accounts he wis chaiged with
the enormous sum of $8,365,377 18'
This, even, staitled not the Rip Van Winkle
of the Treasuiy, but next comes lazily along an-
other letter fiom the Auditor's office, signed by
cleik Mahon, to Swaitwout, dated August 13—
ÍMJomoní/is again, after Wolf's adjustment-—nearly
foui months after Puce's of the 25th, which was
to admit of but a short delay, and which lequired
only " sevetal days," at most—calling upon him
to foiwaii his accounts '
Swartwout took steam for England in two days
afteiwards, August 16' If tins was speed, "go
it, ye teitapms'" Put Woodbury after Swart-
woutand Price' He gave them the word "go,"
and said "I am coming'" A Muscovy diake
after night hawks ' Sir, every step he took was
like those of his own unwieldy body—heavy and
slow, every indication lieie is that he was rather
foi giving them timely and friendly warning to
tai i  btca 1, r ot lee bail '
It is amusing, now, to look at the next letter of
the Department and its date Miller, theAuditoi,
reports to Barker, the Comptrollei, August 31,
half a lunar after the bird had flown, that Swart-
wout's accounts had not been íeceived ' On the 3d
of Septembei his (Swartwout's) securities were
notified that he had not rendeied his account'
The poor fellows took advantage of this notice,
no doubt They were fools, if they did not, and
then came the circulars, the letters of inquiry, the
dispatches to New York, the bustling activity,
the huily burly of confusion and wonder and sui-
prise—" Why, why, why ' Swartwout is gone'
He is a defaulter' Who would have thought it'
How did it happen ' Can anybody tell how'
Can you, Mi Auditor'—you, Comptioller'—
anybody'"
Such is a picture of the administration of your
Treasury It is literally administered, and re-
turned insolvent
Why was this delay fiom April to October,
1838, to ascertain what Pi ice told them they might
readily ascertain ' Why this postponement to
examine invoices and appraisements ' I will tell
you, sir Notwithstanding Mr Secretary tells
you there was no suspicion, even—no, not the
least—this thing was as well known, not perhaps
the amount exactly, but the defalcation was as
well known, before October, as afterwards in No-
vember But the elections were in October, and
concealment of this nefarious transaction was
everything until after the Empire State and her
sisteis of the Union had voted This was the
secret of this delay, and this was Swartwout's
passport to Europe ' "Better let it be" until after
the elections ' It would not do. If it had been
known, when elections were turning on the sub-
Treasuiy scheme, that the chief sub-treasurer
had marched off with a million and moie of ths
public money, it would have had an electric ef
feet, it would have won for the country a victory
in Ohio, notwithstanding abolition and its kin-
dred political vices ' Thank God, it is in time
for you, sir, in Tennessee'
But, again. From the joint report of the Comp-
