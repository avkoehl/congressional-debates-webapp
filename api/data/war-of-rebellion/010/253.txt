Colonel Stuart was wounded severely, and yet reported for duty on Monday morning, but was compelled to leave during the day, when the command devolved on Colonel T. Kilby Smith, Fifty-fourth Ohio, who was always in the thickest of the fight and led the brigade handsomely. I have not yet received Colonel Stuart's report of the operations for his brigade during the time he was detached, and must therefore forbear to mention names. Lieutenant-Colonel Kyle, of the Seventy-first, was mortally wounded on Sunday, but the regiment itself I did not see, as only a small fragment of it was with the brigade when it joined the division on Monday morning. Great credit is due the fragments of men of the disordered regiments who kept in the advance. I observed and noticed them, but until the brigadiers and colonels make their reports I cannot venture to name individuals, but will in due season notice al who kept in our front line, as well as those who preferred to keep back near the steamboat landing.

I will also send a full list of the killed, wounded, and missing, by name, rank, company, and regiment. At present I submit the result in figures:*

The enemy captured seven of our guns on Sunday, but on Monday we recovered seven guns-not the identical guns we had lost, but enough in numbers to balance the account. At the time of recovering our camps our men were so fatigued that we could not follow the re-
