Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS, Chattanooga:

Send forward clothing for this command as fast as it arrives at Chattanooga. If you have clothing on hand that can possibly be spared, send it forward and deduct the same amount from that coming forward for Foster. Troops here are in bad condition for clothing, and before making much advance must be supplied.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

General S. D. STURGIS,

General Parke's Headquarters, Strawberry Plains:

I have withdrawn McCook, forming line on east side of creek, with Foster on left picketing and patrolling road to Dyer's Ford. Wolford covers mouth of Chucky road and to Hagood's Gap. We can hold the above line against a greater force than was against us on 29th. I know of no better line east of the hills, about 1 or 2 miles west of New Market.

No indications of an advance by the enemy. Where is our infantry force?
