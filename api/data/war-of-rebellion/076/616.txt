SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, August 20, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I will be over to-day, but must spend some time with General Howard to arrange as to certain troops still in Mississippi. If you go to the extreme right of your lines I will join you there.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS, Camp Creek Church, August 20, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,Commanding, &amp;c.:

The command reached here a little after noon with very slight opposition, the rebel vedettes falling back with but few shots. Colonel Stiles' brigade is on the left, General Cooper's on the right, Colonel Bond's in reserve. The right crosses the road at Diggs', the left is refused with an interval between the brigades of about one-quarter of a mile, the whole covered by a connected line of skirmishers, which is continuous all the way to my camp. A regiment is at Widow Lee's, and covering the road to Bacon's Post-Office. It is raining hard and steadily. If it clears in time I purpose sending a regiment to push as far up toward East Point as possible. At present the woods are so wet as to make it very difficult to do so with any effect.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
