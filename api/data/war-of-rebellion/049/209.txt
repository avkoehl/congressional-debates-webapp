think the main body of the enemy opposite to us are in the vicinity of Raccoon Ford, with from four to six regiments at Morton's Ford. At Stringfellow's Ford I think their force at present is very light.

The contrabands at Dr. Morton's state that Longstreet's corps was sent to Tennessee about ten days since, while the contrabands at Thornton Stringfellow's say it has only gone to Louisa County.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
