Captain T. MELVIN,

A. A. G., Dept. of West Virginia, Cumberland, Md.:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Thoburn reports that a deserter from McNeill's company arrived yesterday morning at Petersburg, who reports that the force in the vicinity of Moorefield is composed of detachments from the commands of Imboden and Fitzhugh Lee. He states that the conversation among the men is that Early is at Orkney Springs and Fitzhugh Lee's entire command in camp. He heard them talk of shoeing their horses and making another demonstration in the direction of Petersburg. The supply train has reached Petersburg in safety. The enemy was in wait for it across the Patterson's Creek Mountain, but owing to the strength of the guard did not attack.

I am, captain, faithfully,

JAS. A. MULLIGAN,

Colonel.

Have you any news this a. m.? Keep you cavalry active and well to the front so as to keep yourself fully advised of enemy's movements. Sullivan's cavalry went toward Winchester last night. Mosby attacked Major Cole in Loudoun County near Harper's Ferry yesterday morning, and was handsomely repulsed.

Brigadier-General.
