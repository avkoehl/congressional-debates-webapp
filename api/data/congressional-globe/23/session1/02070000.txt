Vol. l....No. 13.
IN SENATE.
Saturday, Feb nary 22, 1834.
Mr. TYLER presented resolutions of the Legis-
lature of the State of Virginia, instructing the
Senators and requesting the Representatives in
Congress to exert themselves to effect the restora-
tion of the public deposites to the Bank of the
United States.
After a few remarks by Mr. TYLER, the reso-
lutions were read.
Mr. RIVES rose and said:
Mr. President: The Senate will indulge me, I
hope, standing in the position 1 do, with a few re-
maika on the subject of the íesolutions just read.
It is veiy far from my intention to attempt to im-
pugn, in any manner, the force of those resolu-
tions, or to derogate, in the slightest degree, from
the high respect to which they are entitled here
and elsewhere On the contrary, I recognise them
as the legitimate ex,piession of the opinion of my
State, conveyed through the only authentic organ
known to her constitution and laws.
The Senate will have peiceived, from the read-
ing of the resolutions, that it is my misfoitune to
entertain, and to have expressed, on the giave
questions now occupy ing the'pubhcmmd, opinions
very different fiom those assented by the resolu-
tions Notwithstanding this difference of opinion,
I should feel it my duty, as one of the representa-
tives of Virginia on this floor, to confoim to the
■views expressed by her Legislature, if, in the cir-
cumstances 111 which 1 am placed, I could do so
without dishonor I hold it, sir, to be a vital prin-
ciple of our political system, one indispensable to
the preservation of oui institutions, that therepre
sentative, whether a member of this or the other
House, is bound to conform to the opinions and
wishes of his constituents, authentically expiessed,
or if he be unable to do so, from overruling and
imperious considerations operating upon his con-
science or honor, to suirender his trust into the
hands of those from whom hedeiived it, that they
may select an agent who can better carry their
views into effect.
On all occasions involving questions of expedi-
ency only, it is, I conceive, the bourden duty of
the íepresentative to confoim lmp'iculy to the in-
structions of the constituent body, wheie those
instructions are to be carried into execution by a
legislaluc act, which, as a mandate of the public
will, prescribes and directs what </iriíí be done for
the public good But where the instiuctions con-
template a decUti ation of pi ificijiíc m opinions which
are contrai y to the smcei e and honest convictions
of the lcpiesentative, as there is no means of for-
cing the assent of the understanding to abstract
proposition , the only course left to him is, by the
surrendei of his commission, to put it in the power
of his constituents to confer it 011 another, whose
opinions correspond with fien own
To apply these principles to my own case, I do
not hesitate to say, that if the instructions of the
Legislature of my State had íequired me specifi-
cally to votefor a law or other legislative act, pro-
viding for the restoration of the public deposites to
the Bank of the United States, however highly in-
expedient I deem such a measuie to be, I should
nevertheless have felt it my duty to give the vote
lequired. Such, it will be recollected, was the
precise demand of the memorial of the citizens of
Richmond, presented a few days ago by my hon-
orable colleague, and which concluded by asking
that Congress " would provide by lam foi the im-
mediate restoration of the public moneys to the
Bank of the United States "
But, sir, this is not the shape in which the
question is presented to me, by the resolutions
of the General Assembly of my S ate, or by the
pioceedmgs pending in this body Those reso-
lutions instruct the Senators of Virginia, in gen-
e>al terms, " to use their best exeitions to procure
the adoption by Congress of piopet measures for
restoring the public moneys to the Bank of the
United States " Now, sir, I am bound to inquire
13
what are those proper measures, in the contem-
plation of the Legislatuie of Virginia.
We all know that the only measures proposed,
or contemplated in this body, are the two declara-
tory resolutions offered by the Senator of Ken-
tucky: the first, affirming that the conduct of the
Prfsidentwith íeference to the removal of thepub-
licdeposites, was a dangerous and unconstitutional
assumption of power; the second, declaung the
reasons assigned by the Secretary of the Treasury
for that removal, to beunsatisfactoiy and insuffi-
cient. When the lattei of these resolutions, to-
gether with the repoit of the Secretary of the
Treasury, was referí ed some days ago to the Com-
mittee on Finance, that committee did not report a
bill, 01 joint íesolution, for the íestoration of the
deposites, but simply a recommendation, that ihe
Senate adopt the declaratory resolution of the Sen-
ator fiom Kentucky In shoit, it is now avowed
and understood on all hands, that all that is deemed
necessary, or will be pioposed here, to effect a
restoration of the public moneys to the Bank of
the United States, is ameie declaration by Con-
gress, of the insufficiency of the reasons assigned
for their removal.
The only measures, then, on which I shall be
called to carry into effect the instructions of the"
Legislature of my State are, the declmatmy reso-
lutions moved bytheSenatoi from Kentucky,and
now depending before the Senate. That these
resolutions are, in the estimation of the General
Assembly of Virginia, proper measures—that the
opinions and principles declared by them are be-
lieved by the General Assembly tobe correct and
welt founded—it would be unpardonable blindness
to the language and tenor of their instructions not
to see At the same time, it is well known to the
Senate, that on each of the propositions declared
in these resolutions, [ had (and I will take leave to
add, after the most careful and anxious investiga-
tion) come to opposite conclusions, which 1 had
earnestly asserted and maintained on this floor 1
am, therefore, placed, by the instructions of the
Legislatuie of my State, in this dilemma—either
to vote for the declaiatoiy lesolutions of the Sen-
ator from Kentucky, and thereby express opinions
which I not only do not entertain, but the reverse
of which I have sincerely and earnestly maintained
on this floor, or, by voting against them, to op-
pose the only meamies which are likely to come
before this body, having in view the restoration of
the public deposites to the Bank of the United
States, and thus appeal in the attitude of disre-
garding and thwarting the declared wishes of the
Geneial Assembly of Virginia I am sine I but
respond to the honorable feelings of all who h"ar
me, in saying- that the first branch of the alterna-
tive is impossible, while the latter is no less forbid-
! den by my punciples, and a proper sense of duty ¡
■ to the constituted authorities of my State The
only course left to me, then, is one which the Senate 1
can be at no loss to anticioate                                    I
Befoie I close the few íemarks with which I
have felt myself called on to trouble the Senate,
1 beg leave to say, that, while Í recognise implicitly
the resolutions just read as the legitimate and con-
stitutional expiession of the opinion of my State,
I wish not to  be understood as saying that they j
express the leal public opinion of the State—that |
of the People     On thecontraiy, my firm and j
clear conviction is, that the sentiments of the people j
j in the present instance aie not in unison with the ,
; proceedings  of the  legislative  authority.     The j
manifestations of popular sentiment already com- I
menemg in  various quarters of the  State—the
principles and opinions heretofore steadily cher-
ished by Virginia-—multiplied communications re
ceived from the most resoectablesouices—and my j
own knowledge, I may be peimitted to add, of a I
people with whom i have been connected, in the I
relations of public service, for now near twenty
years, assure me that they are not: and the revo- I
lution of a few months will, I confidently believe,
render the fact manifest to all the world     But in
the regulation of my official conduct here, I am not
permitted to look beyond the const.tutional ex-
pression of the opinion of the State, by its regula*
and proper organ. If a Senator were allowed to
set up against the public opinion of his State as
officially and solemnly declared by her Legislature,
a hypothetical public opinion, which may or may
not be that of the people of the State, it is obvious
that a door would be opened for the total evasion
of all effective íesponsibility of this bodyto public
opinion. It is on the Legislatuies of the States
that the Constitution has devolved the choice of
members of this body, and the same Legislatures
must be the interpreters of the public opinion of
their respective States to the Senators chosen by
them, whenever an occasion shall arise which may
call for a solemn manifestation of that opinion
This is indeed the only practicable mode of
bringing the opinion of the sovereign communities
repiesented in this body to act with authoritative
influence, on its proceedings; and when it is con-
sidered that the Senate is, by the greater perma-
nency of its offical tenure, farther removed from
the salutaiy controls of the representative system
than any othei branch of the Government, ail will
see the necessity of keeping open a clear and des-
ignated channel by winch public opinion may
promptly leach it, in an authoritative form, and
be made tfiectual on Us deliberations. It is thus
essential to the practical supremacy Of the popular
will itself, that the S'ate Legislatuies should be
recognised as the authentic and constitut onal ex-
ponents of the popular opinion of the respective
States, in all íelations with this body. If, in any
instance, the Legislatures of the States shall mis-
take the opinions of the people, it is, as I conceive,
for the people themselves, and not for us, to cor-
rect the mistake
These, Mi. Piesident, are very briefly the Opin-
ions I entertain on the delicate questions presented
foi my consideration by the instructions of the
Legislatuie of my State just read, and the only
altei native they leave me, in the circumstances in
which I am placed, is to sunender the tiust with
which 1 have been honored as a membei of this
body into the hands of those fiom whom I le-
ceived it I know well, Mi Piesident,and I feel
how much of honor and of satisfaction I give up
in abandoning my seat on this floor. I abandon
what I have ever regarded the highest honoi of
my public life—an honoi than which none higher,
m my opinion, can be presented to the ambition
óf an American citizen. I sacrifice social and kind-
ly relations with many members of this body—I
would fam hope with alt—which have been the
source of the highest satisfaction to me here, and
the remembrance of which I shall cheush with
sincere pleasure in the retirement whither I go I
know and feel the weight of these sacrifices, but
great as they are, I make them without a sigh, as
the most eni| hatic homage I can lender to a prin-
ciple I believe vi al to the Republican system, and
indispensaole to the safe and salutary action of our
political institutions.
