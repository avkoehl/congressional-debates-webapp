Our scouts have already been forward 18 miles and find no enemy. I have left the Fourteenth Kentucky at Paintville to guard stores and protect our communication with the Ohio.

The acting brigade quartermaster is greatly in need of funds. His requisitions were sent to headquarters several weeks ago, but he has not yet received a remittance.

Very respectfully,

If it is true that the rebel shave bentonite Nashville and have fallen back on Murfreesborough to make a stand, it will be necessary to make our next movement with great caution. Give me the number of troops you can concentrate on Murfreesborough, independently of Halleck's troops.
