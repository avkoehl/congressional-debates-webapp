Mr FILLMORE, from the Committee of Ways and Meins,
rnovea" that the committee concur with the Senate m striking
out the word "completing," and nonconcur wiihthe Senate
in striking out *50 000 and inserting $100 000
Mr JONES of Virginia opposed the increase of the appropn
ation, and showed that the building had already cost over
$600,000 although the oi iginal estimate, under which the pas
sage of the first appropriation wasobtamed was but $30 000
The original law he said, authorized the purchase of a site and
the building of this custom house, and appropuated $50 COO foi
completing the whole work piovided that those to whose man
agement the subject should be intrusted should be of opinion
that it could berompleted foi that sum, addul to theproceeds of
th  sale of the old custom house
Mr. J lefeired to-and read the original law He said he was
not sufficiently acquainted with the progross of the wotk to
form an exact estimate of the sum that would be necessaiy
ÍOX the completion of the bmhlins, but he should suppo&o
that, after 1600,000 had been expended, $50,000 ought now to be
enough
Mr riLLMORE replied, contending that ®60 000 would not
be sufficient to complete the building and probably five or six
tiroes thatsum would be required He thought it would be a
matter of economy, at this time, to appropi ule $100,000 instead
of «50,000
Messrs ADAMS, WHITE, and PaRMENTER severally
spoke m favor of increasing the appropriation
Mr MMilWETHCR opposed the appropriation as extrava
gant and unnecessary, and contended that the practico ol run
nmg up the expenditures on public buildings to such extrava
gant lengths without the authority of law, and m the absence of
appropriations, was an abuse that ought to beconected, and,
In conclusion, cmtrasted the pro lig&l expenditure of seven or
eight hundred thousand dolíais fot the Boston custom house,
with the economy that refused an appi opriation o( twenty thou
sahd for the custom house at Savannah
flf|r  JONES of Virginia confessed that he was astonished
when he heard the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means say that five or six times the amount appropriated by
the House would be necessary to complete the building par
ticulatíy when ho considered that over «600,000 h id already

of no mode of arresting it, but by withholding the appropna

so, when the public agents entered into expenditures not author

Mr SALTONSTALL «aid that the subject had been so fully
discussed when the bill was before undei considexation, that he
should not have taken part m the debate but foi some lemai les

Thc^ublJcbmidigsareaH completed,ornearly so He referred
isHb  Treasury and other buildings m Washington and to the
cííníSíiaAcfutfftBin Kew York and Boston    Mr S denied that
there had been any deception or designed misrepresentation as
tothis building Why the original appropriation was made in
the form it was, he knew not No one acquainted with the
value of land and the cost of erecting buddings- in Boston,
could have supposed that a custom house could be built there
for 050 000, in addition to the proceeds of the s tie of the pres
ent establishment The land in any part of that city suitable
for the purpose must cost a larger sum than the whole appro
pnation It ought to be recollected that, before any expendí
ture was made, the sum of $200 000 w as appropriated, without
any limitation as to the cost of the buildiog The plan vtnn
agreed upon, all the appiopnations were made, and the build
Ing has bO far been erected by the piedpcesbors of the present
Executive and the present Congress There has been no con
uealment Every thing has been done with the full ¿nowledge
an 1 approbation of the Secretary of the 'Ireasury What is
to be gained by now withholding the necessary appropriations
for completing the building? Foi what purpose shall it be suf
fered to remain in its unfinished stated It has been said, as a
rebuke A rebuke to whom? It will be no punishment to those
who alone aie responsible—to the former Executive, or former
Congresses
I his Congress is not responsible for the carelessness or mis
conluct of its predecessors But he did not know thatthtie
was any guilt to be punished in any quarter The expense has
no doubt, greatly exceeded what was anticipated This is a
common case with the Government, and with individuals also,
who undertake to erect buildings in any oiher way than by ex-
press oi minute contracts It has been contended by many that
all public works, including ships of wai, should be built in this
way—on contracts with íespoi sible persons It may be so, but
it is too late to apply the remedy to the rast The appropna 
tion isnot wanted, as thegentleman from Virgmiahas suggested,
io complete a building to which the people may iefta with
pride, as a specimen of national ai chitectural ta  e and beauty
but to f revent it from remaining in its unfinished state to be
pointed at with shame as a national disgrace Mi S contended
that true economy required a concurrence with the Senate, that
the commissioners might go on with the work, aod that a small
appropriation would be of little use, as it would all be exhaust
ed in the payment ol arrearages, and peihaps the tmrcha c of
some materials The dismissal of the workmen and mechanicq
would be a great public loss He also contended that it would
be injudicious to undeitake to prescribe to what part of the
work thf money should be applied The budding is to be
eiected on a certain plan, and the whole might be maired by di
reetmg that the ornamental work shall bo omitted Who is to
decide what is ornamental, as distinct from useful1 He be
lieved that there was but one opinion in Boston on th<  subject—
that a suitable appropriation ought to be made for the pi osecu
tion of the work The former vote m the House had caused
universal surprise
lhe amendment was further sustained by Mr CUSfJING
and by Mr CAIIIOUN, who, although he had le isttd ap
propnationa foi such magnificent buil lings foi bus ness pur
poses in the first instance, was yet in favoi as the building had
progiessed so fai, of making a i espectable appropriation to

could not get over this fact It waa an old Jashioned notion of

and he hoped it would bo followed up on the present occa

urgent appeal to the committee to let the question betaken

there were yet i number ol Senate amendments which remain
e i to be acie 1 upon lit uiffstitly appealed to the House to let
the question be taken
After some further lemarksfrom Mr ADAMS, in favoi of
tí e amendment of the aúnate—
Mi sUlLLDS of Alabama sail he would detain the commit
tee hut a moment Ilib object was mainly to make an explana
turn mthe way of replv to a portion of the íemaik*. which h ]
fallen from the fípntlemao from ISew iork, io which he me d
that the commute  shoi.il cjucui m the amendment of the
->emse to this clause of the bill inasmuch as u ha J just concur
red in anothet amendment of the Senate, which mue?$ed the
tppiopriauon towards the completion of the marine ho&pital
at Mobile fiom ten thousand to fifteen thousand dollars He
wished to put the gentleman right as to the facts of the case to
which hah^d alluded The amendment of the Senate to that
pan of the bill relating to the hospital at Mobile did no increase
the appiopriatio , but merely consolidated the two clauses into
one retaining the aggregate of the sums appropriated by the*
bill as it went from this House When the bdl was firstreport-
ed to this House by the Committee of Ways and Means, it con-
tained a clause appiopnating five thousand dolara only to the
completion of the marine hospital at Mobile
He then called the attention of the Committee of Ways and
Means to the entire inadequacy of the sum, and referred them
to a íeport from the Committee on Commerce, made two years
.since, recommending the appropriation oí twenty thousand
dollars to that ob)ect The result was, that the Committee of
Ways and Means instructed their chairman t o move an amend-
ment to the bill whilst yet va Committee of the Whole, which
he did, and which consisted of an additional clauseappropnat-
mg fen thousand dollars more Thus the bill, as reported fey
the Committee of the Whole to the House, and as it passed the.
House contained two clauses—one appropriating five thou-
sand dollars, and the other ten thousand dollars—fifteen thou-
sand dollars, in the aggtegate, to the completion of thehospual
at that place lhe amendment of the Senate merely consoli-
dated these two clauses into one appropna ing the same amount.
It was merely a question oí form, and not of substance
lie «aid he would avail hnraelf of that occasion—for fear h©
might be cut off by the application of the pievious question in
toe House from saying any th af if it should be necessary, to/
sustain this item in die bill to urge upon gentlemen the abso.
lu e necessity of retaining the amount appiopnated by the bill
as it parsed the Hou&e and had been confix med by the Senate.
It was the smallest amount, he felt confident, from all the infor-
mation he had obtained, wh ch would ans ver any useful pur-
pose He refeired to the estimate made by the architect, and
transmitted by the collector of the port of Mobile to the Secre-
tary of the ireasury, and by him to the Committee of Ways
and Means in which the s=um of fiiteen thousand dollars vvas
repi evented as be ng absolutely necessary to put the building in
acondition fit for occupation by fifty patientb, which was just
half the number it was oi gmally desigred to accommodate
j It had be^n oi igmal > pt ojected on i he scale of an hospital of the
first class 1 he su*n \ roposed to be appropriated would fit it
for theaccommodationof the number of p i tients which hospi-
tal o*" the b-cond class only were designpd to accommodate
He would have made these remark", he ssaid, before, if any
objection had been made to a com urience m the alteration of
form proposed by the air endmentof the Senate, when that part
of their amendments was under consideration He hoped gen-
tlemen would bear the facts he had stated in mind when they
came to act upon this amendment in the House
In reference to the proposition now under consideration, (th©
amendment of the ¡senate proposing to appropriate one bun-
dled thousand, instead of fif y thou and, dollar  to the Boston
custom house,) his mind had undergone some change from the
investigation he had given to the papers in possession of th©
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, which, that
gentleman had been kind enough to submit to his inspection.
It appealed that this sum was but two thirds of the amount esti-
mated by the architect and commissioners as necessary to be
expended during tho ensuing year towards the completion of
that buil ling The amount estimated was one hundred and
f ftv thousand dollar* , the whole amount estimated as being
sum* lent fn the entire completion of the building was three
bundled thousand dollars ^he estimates, he said were ren-
dered more in detail than they had been in the commencement
oí the builJmg, and on that account, he supposed, were enti-
tled to more íespect ¡something more was necessary to entitle
them to tespect than anything he-etofore connected with, esti-
mates ftom that quartei, if we were to be at all guided by
experience
He adverted to ti e estimates originally made of the coetof
the building how lai tie amount already expended had ex-
ceeded these estimates being bomething neai eighty thousand
dollars, and to the fact, that still three hundred thousand dollar 
moie would be necessaiy to complete the establishment *He
alluded to the ornamente! character of several items m the
estimates—the dome, which it was proposed to rear upon the
roof of the building and asked of what utility this dome could
be? Gentlemen tell me, he said that it is necessary to afford
light to the central par^-s of the building This might be so,
and still he had no doubt that much money would be unneces.
sanly expended upon it with a view to splendor magnificence,
and eublimuy of appearance He had observed much extrav-
agance, gieat waste oí money, with but little taste, in the rear-
ing of domes upon costly buddings That hall presented a
monument of that character
In reference to this building, he sard, which was to cost the
Government the roundsum of one million of dolíais,, the Gov-
verbme it had got us hand into the lion s mouth Tt had already
expended six hundred and ninety six thousand dollars, and the
question now was, How much shou'd be expended during the
ensuing > ear, to keep the building m progress, ard, if not to
keep it in progiess to prevent decay % Upon a view of all the
fa. ts he felt deposed to concur mthe amendment of the Sen-
ate wh ch increased the appiopriation of the Hou*e from fifty
to one hundred thousand dolíais, bu' was short of the estimates
submitted by the architect and commissioners some 334 pet
<.e¡ t This seemed to be a middle ground , and if the commit-
tee should concur in the amenument of the Semite he had pre
paied ant1 would offt-r ano hei amendment, providing that the
sum appropriated shou d be expended exclusivtly in the com-
plfiion of thf substantial nece«saiy parts of the building
