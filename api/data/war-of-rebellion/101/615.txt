HEADQUARTERS LA FOURCHE DISTRICT,Thibodeaux, La., January 23, 1865.

Captain FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Defenses of New Orleans:

The couriers (Eleven in number) coming down from Plaquemine were attacked to-day. Colonel Fiske reports that three of them have come in. Their horses were so poor that the remainder were probably captured. I have ordered the system of couriers suspended by telegraph. Meanwhile the tri-monthly report from Plaquemine for the ten days ending January 20 has not yet been received. If your require it, I will make my report from the last previous tri-monthly. If so, shall I drop the Ninety-ninth U. S. Colored Infantry? I have had no official notice of their departure.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.
