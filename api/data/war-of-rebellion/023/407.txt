and perhaps some misapprehension, the concentration was not effected as I designed, and is not yet, though the troops are now in motion for that object. If not too late it will yet be made at Altamont and the enemy attacked on that route; but my impressions are that the enemy is already at Altamont. If the junction cannot be affected there it may be necessary to fall back on Murfreesborough. More embarrassing than the force in front is the condition of things in the rear. Our communications have now been effectually cut for twelve days. I have had no force there sufficient to open and keep them open, and our supplies cannot last more than ten days. This condition of things had determined me to withdraw the stationary force from the roads so as to increase the force at Nashville and in the rear, if possible, without reducing my active force, which after all cannot be brought up to more than about 30,000 men. The force is clearly insufficient, and ought to be increased without an hour's delay. The consequences may otherwise be of the most serious character. I have been of this opinion for some time. Grant's troops have not crossed the river that I have heard of, and it must be several days before they can complete the march to form a junction even if they were already across. New troops, if they could move rapidly enough, are not suitable for the service required. We want cavalry very much.

Add to my last dispatch that no wagon had crossed up to 10 o'clock yesterday if I omitted to say so.

Colonel HARRIS, Battle Creek:

Have you entire confidence in the veracity of your scouts? Do they report from their own observation? Are they citizens or soldiers? They must be mistaken.
