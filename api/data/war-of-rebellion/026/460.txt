Major-General DIX:

The cars were running from Petersburg to Zuni all last night, and it is presumed with additions of force. This information has just come in, and I doubt not accounts for the signals. Probably intending to strike here in the absence of one-half of my force, or strike Wessells in the flank. Colonel Dodge is going out toward Zuni to watch any movements.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose six telegraphic dispatches from Major-General Peck.*

I wrote to General Foster soon after I saw you in Washington, offering to co-operate with him, and promising at least a demonstration on the Blackwater which might produce a diversion in his favor. I have had no answer from him and have acted on the presumption that my letter never reached him, although in sending expeditions to the Blackwater I have influenced also by the desire to accustom my troops to marching, bivouacking, &amp;c., and to the fire of the enemy.

I inclose a map of the district between Suffolk and the Blackwater, on which a map of the district drawn.+

Will you please let the President see the accompanying telegraphic dispatches, which may throw a little light on my dispatch to him yesterday?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
