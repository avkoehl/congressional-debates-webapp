tales, and have been made the pretext of wanton privations to our faithful soldiers in their hands. They compel sufferings to their own soldiers by their malignant outrages against civilized warfare, and then find in such excuse for visiting cruetly and starvation on our soldiers, to whom it is not pretended they could not easily afford all the comforts and subsistence due to captives in war. The ineffable beseness of such a course exceeds even its inhumanity, and for either it would be difficult to find a parallel in the history of civilized, much less Christian, nations.

It is gratifying to be able to state that since the foregoing was written a prospect has been afforded of ameliorating the condition of our captive soldiers. When all overtures to the Government of our enemies seemed vain, general Lee was instructed to make directly to General Grant a proposition that, without releasing either Government from the obligation of affording due provision to its captives, each should have the right of furnishing to its own prisoners in the possession of the other, under the direction of officers among them to be paroled for the purpose, such additional supplies of necessary articles as might deem expedient to send. This was accepted, doubtless through the influence of the commanding general of the Federal armies, who, however profuse of the lives of his men in battle, could but have sympathy and interest for the imprisoned soldier. It is indicative of the remorseless policy of the hostile Government that such concessions to the claims of humanity should have been made sooner by the stern soldier in the field than by their statesmen in the Cabinet. As the liberty is afforded by the agreement, with commendable liberality, that supplies may be purchased in Northern cities, or sent to our soldiers in captivity directly from foreign ports, there can be but little delay or difficulty in affording to them all reasonable supplies for the alleviation ostate. This arrengement will be as gratifying to our Government and people as it is conformable to humanity and wise policy.

The report of oru agent of exchange is submitted in connection with this subject. It will display the past course and present state of negotiations for exchange. *

The operations of the several administrative bureaus of the Department have been conducted with zeal, ability, and success, reflecting great credit on their several heads. They have had grievous difficulties and embarrassments to encounter from a depreciating currency, deficiencies of labor and materials, and straitened means of transportation and distribution. In addition, they have been constrained, by the stringent legislation of Congress, to relinquish their most active and experienced agents and employes and substitute them from the more infirm and aged classes. It was not practicable to do this immediately without a ruinous arrest of all the essential operations of production and supply for the Army; but the obligation has been steadily observed, and as the exigencies of the campaign made recruitment of our armies necessary, its execution has been hastened and enforced to the furthest point compatible with the preservation and continuance of indispensable works. Interference of this kind are inevitably so prejudicial and disturbing that it is hoped a well-devised and permanent system of providing and retaining in continuous employment a sufficient number of artisans, experts, and laborers for all essential operations may be devised and established. Great misapprhension, it is believed, has prevailed in the public mind, both as
