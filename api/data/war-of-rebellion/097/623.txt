It was designed the Sixth Corps should proceed in the same direction, but General Wright reports he is moving on Farmville. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the road and movements of the enemy to know whether this will throw him out of your support or not. The Sixth Corps will move to the left, but have yet halted. I can halt them if indications in your front make it necessary. Advise me promptly. I am on my way to High Bridge.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 7, 1865-12 m.

Major-General MEADE:

So far as my information goes Wright at Farmville would be in supporting distance. I have sent Barlow up the railroad to Farmville. He is quiet close to it, and is skirmishing with the enemy there. Supposing the enemy would attempt to reach Lynchburg by the road from Farmville, on the north side of the Appomattox I have moved Miles and De Trobriand and the artillery to that road. They will strike it about three miles from Farmville. A column of our cavalry on the south side of Appomattox, which I saw moving, will reach Farmville about the same time as Barlow. Artillery cannot move along Barlow's route.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

I will advise you promptly of any further information or change of condition.

General MEADE:

I have come up to Mahone's division. I am with Miles and De Trobriand's divisions, about four miles from Farmville, and shall attack. If Griffin or some one else can strike Farmville they will cut off Mahone's line of retreat.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 7, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Wright is moving on Farmville. I have sent him your dispatches and urged him forward. Do you think the enemy is moving for Lynchburg or Danville? All accounts represent the enemy as greatly demoralized.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
