THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May  18,
to speak of the intelligence and patriotism of their
constituents But, sir, my constituents require of
me no compliment of this sort. Like the people
of other sections of the country, they very well
understand the bearing and effects upon their own
interests, the peimanent interests of their country
and its political institutions, of any measure of
Government, or of any power seeking an extia-
neous influence over the action of the Government,
or the interests and liberties of the people; and I
trust, sir, they have patriotism enough to resist
any such influence, by proper means, even should
it require* temporary sacrifice of individual inter-
est or convenience.
The meeting which adopted these resolutions
was held at a favorable time to pronounce a just
judgment upon the topics which they had met to
deliberate upon It was not suddenly called to-
gether under the influence of a panic, which had
been excited throughout the whole country, pro-
moted and urged on by certain presses, political
paitisans, and interested individuals, and which,
to say the least, was not diminished by those
speeches which were distributed through the coun-
try, m which imagination haddepictedm glowing
colors, the wide spread ruin and distress which
was to come upon the people, and which was
charged in advance to the policy of the Adminis-
tration I say, su, this meeting was not suddenly
called undersuch circumstance^. They had waited,
deliberated, witnessed the panic, felt the pressure,
and caiefully investigated the cause, and then, sir,
they assembled to give an expression of opinion
thus matmely and deliberately foimed This
meeting was also called immediately after the elec-
tion had been held in the several towns of the
county, at which the people had indicated their
political sentiments, by electing town officeis
fnendlyto the Administration m fourteen out of
seventeen town's of which the county is composed,
and in peihaps every town, resolutions had been
passed by the people, expressing theirviewsupon
the political questions of the day. It was, sir,
undei such favorable circumstances for forming a
coireu judgment, and of knowing public senti-
ment, that the Republicans of the county of Onon-
daga convened and adopted these lesolutions, as
the deliberate sense, not only of that meeting,
which was largely attended, but also of a majority,
a respectable majority, of the people of the county,
as was evident from the recent elections And,
su, instead of that change of political sentiment
which is said to have taken place in the public
mind, we find them reitei Uing the opinions winch
they have expressed on foimei occasions, approv-
ing the policy of this Admimstiation.and particu-
larly as relates to the United States Bank And
in reference to the removal of the Government
deposites fiom the bank, believing that the cuittal-
ment of its discounts which was in rapid progress,
if with the vie*- of winding up its aifairs at the
expiration of its charter, rendered the deposites
useless to the bank, and advantageous to the local
institutions in afioi ding the necessary accommoda-
tions to the public; or, if with the view of oppress-
ing the people, and coercing a compliance with its
wishes, the deposites ought not to remain m the
hands of an institution with such dangerous power
and alarming designs upon the interests and inde-
pendence of the people—designs rendeied the mol e
certain by subsequent events They haveiesolved ,
-" that the removal of the Governmeit deposites
' hom the United States Bark was dictated by a j
' «ne forecistof events, rendering such a measure
' necessary "                                                               !
They have observed, sir, the general policy of i
his Administration, the vigilant care with which !
the Executive has endeavoied to guard the Con-
stitution from encroachments, and the example of
moral courage displayed in his endeavors, on the
one hand, to preserve the Union from the disor-
ganizing effects of that construction of the Fedeial
compact which finds in the sovereign power and
" reserved right ' of any one State, " the rightful
remedy " for what a majority of its citizens might
deem an unconstitutional law, and on the other,
to pievent the dangerous «fleets of that liberal
constiuction which, by implication, would con-
centrate all powei in the hands of the Tederal Gov-
ernment. And notwithstanding, sn, he has been
denounced, both here and elsewhere, for the part
he has taken relative to the recent disposal of the
Government deposites, as having usurped author-
ity, and violated law, and the free use of the terms
despot, tyiant,ttsurper, &c ,they have not been able
to discover that in the removal of a Secretary
of the Treasury, who differed with the President
on prominent measures of his administration, in-
timately connected with that policy which had
most clearly received the sanction of the people,
and the appointment of one of well known differ-
ent views, and who, in the exercise of that power
intrusted solely to his discretion, by the act incor-
poiating the bank, has carried into effect that
which, accoidmg to the dictates of his own judg-
ment, and in the opinion of the Executive, the
public good lequired, by ordering and directing
the deposites to be made in the local banks, I say,
in all this they have not been able to discover any
violation of law, or usurpation of power, and
they have resolved that, among other enumeiated
reasons, " the Chief Magistrate is entitled to the
gratitude of his countrymen for his observance of
the Constitution^and the just limits of executive
power "
They have resolved " that they do not find the
powei tocieatea bank incorpoiation granted in
the Federal Constitution," and " that the existence
of a great national banking institution is formi-
dable and dangerous to hbeny " The charges on
which the bank, in the opinion of the meeting,
" stands condemned at the bar of public senti-
j rnent," are expressed in one of their resolutions in
| clear, forcible, and concise terms, which, as 1 shall
ask for the reading of the resolutions, I will not
now repeat. It will be noticed, sir, that in one of
their resolutions they speak of the " piessure and
consequent prostration of business," as something
that has been, but does not now exist They say
" the late pressure," &c , and although they may
not be entirely relieved from its influence, yet I
undeistand, fiom sources entitled to the fullest
credit, that the times are much improved, business
has íesumed its accustomed activity, and the pro-
duce of the country m Western New York, instead
of bemgreduced one third below its ordinary value,
as was stated a few days since by my honorable
colleague, [Mr Fillmobe,] is now neaily or quite
up to former prices The fullest evidence of the
activity of business may be found in the weekly
statements of the amount of tolls collected on the
canals of that St'ate, from which it appears that
during the first week of navigation $44,642 were
received for tolls, notwithstanding the reduction of
the rates of tolls of 25 per cent on merchandise,
and 10 per cent, on most articles of country pro-
duce, since last yeai The following statement in
the Onondaga Standard of Apnl 30, which I have
just leceived, will show the activity and prospects l
of business in that section of the country, the pre-
dictions to the contrary notwithstanding. " Mr.
' Webstei would blush for his cieduhty it he were
' here to witness, in peison the activity which
' prevails upon the canal. Instead of being re-
'duced, business is evidently greatly on the m-
' crease. The amount of tolls received at the office
' heie, upon all other shipments except lumber,
' the most of which this season is cleaied at Salina,
' is materially laiger than for the same time last
'spring For several days past, the crowd of
' boats near this village has been excessive, and all
' of them are deeply freighted The quantity of
' merchandise coming yp is increasing, and such is
1 the píeseme below, that a line, whose boats were
' designed to íun no furthei west than this place,
1 have taken freight through to Buffalo H shoit, \
'iid doubt can be enlei timed that the business of the
' season iiill begieatei and motepiofitabie than it eiei
' has been " This stafmentot facts, about which
there can be no mistake, is worthy of notice, as it
exhibits a widely different and far more gratifying
prospect, than might be apprehended fiom some
other memorials and lesolutions which havejust
been read
It will be noticed that in one of these resolutions
they have given us their opinion of the causes of
that piessure and embarrassment in business,
which has been experienced And, sir, not being
able to comprehend how the removal of the Gov-
ernment deposites from the United States Bank,
where, under the curtailmentof its discounts which
was going on, they were not needed, and would not
be used as a basis for discounting, and placm 
them in those banks that would, and that have
used them for this purpose, could produce any
pressure, but on the contrary, believing it was cal-
culated to afford relief, they have looked for o'her
and more natural causes, and have assigned reasons
which appear to me much more just, satisfactory,
and ccrect They tell ua tnat they " believe the
late pressure and consequent prostration of busi-
ness, has been caused principally by the policy of
the bank, designedly seizing upon a period when
overtrading and a change fiom credit to cash
duties, favored its wicked purpose of coeicmg,
through the distresses of the country, the renewal
of its chaiter."
I shall not detain the House to notira but one
other íesoluüon adopted at this meeting, and that is
an approval of the measure recently recommended
by the Governor of that State, and which has
already become a law, whereby the credit of the
State is to be pledged, if needful, for the preser-
vation of confidence, and for the protection of its
citizens against any measures, on the part of the
bank, that might embarrass them, or obstruct a
successful prosecution of business.   This measure
I should not here have noticed, but from the fact,
that it seemed to give the honorable gentleman
from Ohio, [Mr Corwin,] and some others, much
serious alarm     But, sir, I must confess that in
this most judicious and patriotic measure, which
has met the approbation of this meeting, and, I
believe, of a vast majority of the people of that
State, I have not been able to discover anything
that need excite alarm in the breast of that hon-
orable gentleman, or any one else, except, indeed,
it be such as might feel alarmed for those political
prospects that would be liable to be darkened by
the restoration of confidence, the subsiding of the
panic, and the active and prospeious renewal of
business     Such, and such only, as see, or fancy
that they see, their political or party prospects
brighten in proportion as tne distiesses of the
country increase, might, perhaps, in this respect,
justly see in this measure some cause- of alarm.
But, sir, I apprehend that many who have not
taken the trouble to inform themselves upon this
subject, entertain the erroneous impression that
this measure is designed to sustain what is gener-
ally called the safety-fund banks of that State,
which wei e supposed to be in imminent danger.  If
so, I beg leave to say, that the safety and solvency
ot these banks is not, and has not been, questioned
by the people of that State, and the most perfect se-
curity is felt by the holders of their notes, a security
and confidence never so generally felt before the
establishment of that system.  But, in consequence
of the attitude assumed by the United States Bank,
its official declaration of ability to crush the local
banks, and the evident indications of a disposition
to make a demonstration of its power upon the
institutions of that State, has rendered it prudent,
on the part of the banks, to dimmish their circula-
tion and curtail their discounts, in order to be pre-
pared for the worst.  This has necessarily deprived
the people of their ordinary banking accommoda-
tions, and produced a scarcity of money.   To en-
able the city banks to afford the necessary facilities
foi the transaction of its extensive business, and
to meet any emergency that may arise, as well as
to preserve public confidence, and to render to the
1 people of the State at large such aid as cncum-
stances may possibly require, the credit of the
State is to be pledged for the loan of six millions
of dollars, four millions of which is to be loaned to
the banks of the city of New York, if, in the opin-
ion of the Board of Commissioners constituted to
conduct this business, " the public exigencies shall
require it," and the rerrainder to pass into the
hands of the Commissioner of Loans in the seve-
ral counties of the State, to be by tnem loaned to
individuals on security of real estate, if the boards
of supervisors in the several counties shall " deter-
mine that their citizens require it "    But, sir, it is
hoped, and even believed, that this loan may not
be called for or lequired, for, seeing confidence le-
stored, business resuming its accustomed channels
and activity, and the aigis of State protection cast
over the enterprise, the business, and the mstitu
tions of the State, the bank will hardly be disposed
to make a demonstration of its power in that quar-
ter, if it has so designed, and, relieved from all
embairassmg apprehensions of this sort, the local
banks are amply sufficient for all the wants of the
enterprise and the business of the people.
