these wateie, and, of course, rejected the ¡ate notion that the ¡St
John*  does, not iall into the Atlantic ocean'atcordmg to the terms
of the treaty
Great Britain, then, stands condemned by hei own conduct,
andautof the mouths of hei authorized agents She has no
thing left to stand upon m support of her claims, but the fact
that she succeeded m so puzzling the head of the Dutch King
that he could not discover the north w est angle of Nova Scotia
1 will not occupy the time of the Senate in attempting t  íefute
such absurd pretensions as that the noithu eat angle of TSovi
Scotia is at Mars Hill If Gieat Bj nam cannot be sau-fied with
the treaty description oí the highlands, because the waters de
trending the south slope fall into bay*, instead of the sea,
while in every other paiticulai the desci íption is full, ccurate,
and complete, how can she contenther°elf with a hne fre m Cha
leur hay to Mais Hill, which, instead of running on highland*.
crosbcsiustthestieam&of that bay, and next the wateie and val
ley of the gre it St John'tíl How, again, Qdfl -he leconcile it
with her objections to the true highlands, 11 contend ior those
between the &t John's and the Penobbcot, which, in no one par
titular, coriespond to the lequuements m the tieaty'
This isonly proof that selfishness will lead us to xtremitieo
that it is a blind guide, and often conducts tho*e who takecotm
sel of it into the paths oí folly and dishonor
Absurd as these claimable, they have been _i vely ui„ed
by Gieat Britain She seems to me to be aPxmu<.to cl^cu-s
every sort oí piooi butthesimplelanguaeeofthetieat} to rely
on every thing but that which ísitallj too plain to admit ol
muchaigumentoi illustration I had almost said she íesoits
to evasions and subterfuges discreditable to hei bit tonsis
tent with the chaiactcr of elevated, high minded s ueimen to
set up such pretensions as I have desci ibed, to íe^ort to doubts
and quibbles which have nothing to rest on, to see ifshe carnot
worry or intimidate us out of a poition of our tet moiyi 1 hi 
country should never countenance such a Couibe it sbo Id
mark with disapprobation all petifosging m dipkmacv, oil
shifts and evasions mterpesed to deiay an adjustment of tins
comroveisy, we should stand on the tieaty, I old to the evi
dence there, and prevent its being smotheied by the accunm
latton of other mattei Do this m the spirit oi nnnly fnmnt s,
in a tone that will rebuke the follv of quibbles and evasion*
and this dispute will soon end We euall heai no more of
highlands from Chaleui Bay to Mars Hill, or ftomMan  IIul
west We shall hear no more of a northwest angle of Nov %
Scotia at Mai3 Hill, or oí any difficulty in finding the ti tie noith
webtangle Gieat Britain must not be allowed to tníle vu h
nt>¡ or to humbug us When she undeistandb we aie icsohed
not to cede any of our temtoiy to her while she sets up un
founded claims to it, bhe will at once abandon that touise,
and we shall hear of no more theories about the necessity of find
mg mountains to answei to the desuiptionofthe tieatj, when n
exacts nothing but land high enough to divide iho waters and
turn them down each slope
I have now gone through with the remarks I intended to bub
mit inspecting the proof to sustain the claims of the United
 tates to títere lines, and, consequently, to what Gieat Britain
is pleaded to call thedisputed teiutory I am awaie that it is
next to impossible to make this matter unden-tood without the
aid of conect mapa to acquaint the hearer with tht typography
of the countiy, and after the very able and lurid aigi ments of
my colleague, nothing but a conviction of th~ duly I owe to
Masstchlisetid, who has given her Scnatois institutions to
press this matter upon Congress, could h ive induced mo to
address the Senate
The Senator from Maine [Mi Whliams] moves fm lca\c to
bring in a bill dneums the line to be run and maiked dccnidug
to the treaty of 178J Tile details of the bill are not befme th
teenate, foi the leave « not gianted But the chairman of the
Committer on Foreign Affhirshds addicted us upon the ml)
iect, and while he goes firmly and stronglv with u-on the u, it b
tion ofnght, he avows m vciy t\\ licit teinie. his oppo^ii on to
such a measure
I am happy to liavo his influence with ue on the mam ques
tion; but as his opinions indicate the policy tobe pni^tied by th i
Administration, 1 regret to find him anayed against the mea
sure
His reasons are two fold that such a mr Mire would in
volve us m a wai with Gieat Bi tain, ind, secondly suspend
a negotiation now proved tobe opened to adjust tJic contio
\ersy
I should depiecate a war as much ib he cm, but I hd\< no
fears of such a result, for the measure it cli cidjl uo ju t

time  involves necessarily the light to examine the hrts and
the ranks by which iheyaie identified Who ev^i heaid oi
this light being denied to an individual? I confer Hit>ntv\ to me
that it id questioned any where Can Gieat Buiain deny that
she disputes oul claim1? Can she deny that the miter is un
settled' She will do neither On whxt principle can ^ ¡^ roam
lain that an examination with a view tosatiisv otirse \ & wi cie
the treaty line is (foi this uall the bill propose") is an uní ndlj
act? Ii I should find Gieat Britain so u justa« to b i'i ined
at this kind of inquiry, if 1 shoiiki find her afiaidof the investí

but the kindest, most respect! ul, and iriendly teims Btu if
we have not the right to proceed m this way, we have no ¿h o

Mr President, one thing if> plain, and that is, that Great Bn

act with decision and firmness There is not ¿he i emotest dar

in diplomatic chicanery, still she has pride of characier and
self respect, and, I believe, loo high a sense of what is just and
lawful to attempt to enforce such pretensions as are set up in
this matter I will not look uponherasapiratcora robber,
but as a hieh minded people, too just to themselves and us to
sustain such a claim as this by violence ShewiHdo no such
thing It would be worse than iohy, in any point of view. If
we mean to preserve peace, we must be jost to our own cm
zens, and require foreign countries to respect our nehts Thib
matter has been too much neglected, and Great Britain has
gathered courage and strength irom our negligence and disre
gurd of the ushts of Maine I feel assured that if the Senate
had bestowed proper attention upon the subject, if they had
pioperly considered the facts, there would be but one voice he^e
as to the policy to be pursued It would be to go forward firm
]y, temperately, but with unshaken resolution When fireat
Biitam sees this spirit animating us, she will cease to delay our
lights and vex oui citizens
THE DUEL REPORTS.
REMARKS OF MR. N A FLOR,
Of Pennsylvania%
In the House of Representahves^Apnl 28, 1838—On the re
port of the select committee appointed to  investigate die
causes which led to the death oí the I fon Jonathan Cilley
Mr NAYLOR, of Pennsylvania, succeeded in gettine the
floor immediately aftei Mr Stanley had concluded, ano! said
that he was opposed to the motion of the committee, and in fa
vol of recommitting the report to them as suggested by the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr  Adams]   f am opposed
Ctaid Mr N ) to the motion oí the committee on two grounds
first, I believe the committee has violated {though uninten-
tionally) the Constitution and laws of (he 'and, and, secondly,
that they have omitted to do what their duty and the positive
rules of this Houserequned them to do
My first objection involves a wiongful act of counms^ton on
the part of the committee, and my second, one of omission and
neglect I will now endeavor to sustain these two pioyobi
tions by a few remarks, md bhow that, whilst the committee
has exercised a power not siven them, andagamet the rules of
this House, they have at the same timo omitted to perfoim one
of their mof=t important duties
What is the resolution under which the committee was ap
pointed, and how was it adopted/1 At the time the resolution
was íntrr ducedand earned, there could be no discussion, de
bate, or deliberation You, Mr Speaker, know the excitement
that prevailed m this House upon that occabion Every one
who rojeto speak was called to Older almost as soon as his lips
were opened You know, sir, with what tíimculty you re
strained that excitement—an excitement ready to break through
and break down all tamers between it and unlimited indní
gence It demanded all your piompuie&p, expeiience, vigi-
lance and ereat ability to pieserve ordei There was a sl.um
baring volcano m the bi easts of members, which, if once it
had found vent, no human powei could have well controlled
Nor was tins all Party «pint was aroused and the fiend «f
party had reaied his hoi rid fiont, and was stalking through this
hall, breathing his malignant bieath and maddening influence
into the hearts and bObomt. of membeishcre , trampling alike
on the dead and the living, he saw only in the prospect a new
eubiect oí excitement, once more to win back the people to the
embiaceof power
In this condition of the House theie was no proper i*ehbera
tion There could be none Amendments were offered to the
resolution They were rejected A motion was made to post
pone for a few days for the pmpose of giving tunc for the sub
hidpnee of the excitement I voted for that motion because I
really thought the House wao not m the tempei to decide upon
the best course to be taken in the mattei The motion to pott
pone was lost Next came the pievious qupption—the rule of
despotism, and by its tyrannical aid the mtmbeis of the Iiouse
were dnven, without a piopei consideiation of the whole sub
iect, to vote upon tl e íesolution I voted for it I voted for it
because I was for sustaining mwolae the pimie^es. of the
Hou&t, and foi suppiPSbing, a  far as we hadtnc power, the
baibaious and unchi latían piacticc of duelling But I did not
vote for it to empower a committee to ie ire to the black ho'es
of the Capitol, and there, m daikness and recrecy, try, con
demn censuie,and pun sh, without the knowledge of Congress
and the countiy, a pait of the member < f this House
The resolution pa--ed Now, sn, what is, it * Itconsistsof
two branches, and authorize* the committee, fii &t¡ "to investí
gate the c luses whuh led to tho death oí the honorable Jojka
tha& Cilldv, late a member of this Hout>e and the cirenm
stances connected fheiewith,' and secondly, "to inejuue
whether m the case alluded to, thei e haa not been a breach of
the privileges of this House "
Ihisi  the resolution, and the^e ire the inquiries to which
the attention of the committee n di.ected Y\ ell, sir, is iheie
any membpr accused m this rc~oluti«n' Ccitajnly not Is
there any power given heie authorizing the committee to try,
condemn censure; and recommend expulsion of member* from
the House? Certainly not No one can yietcnd that there is
ane\pies& ei ant of such powei foi thei* is no member named
in it noi d d the House put any member on hit> trial So that,
take the naked i evolution by itself, without reference even lo
any rule positively denying the exercise of such authority,
theie does not appeal tobe sucha power granted as the com-
mittee has aseumed Their dutieo were not judicial i they
were mere mqu lers They were not to try, and to judge, and
denounce censures and punishments, noi even to propose
them, they wene not to hear and determine, but to "investigate?*
the facts and circum tance, and "hnqutie" whethei there had
not been a breich of the pnvileges of this House Znve$itgiiie
and inquire \s the language of the resoiuiion, not try^ ad^udg**,
condemn, and propon punishment
Take therefore, the resolutior by itself unlimitedanetupeon
'rolled by the fundamental rules oi this House, and I contend
