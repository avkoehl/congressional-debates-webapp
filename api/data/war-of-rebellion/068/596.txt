armies 10,000 men can be spared from the defenses of Washington, besides all the troops that have reached there since Burnside's departure. Some may also be brought from Wallace's department. We want no more wagons nor artillery.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Wright reports the enemy on his left moving rapidly to his right. I have ordered him to push forward his left, and gain as much ground as possible so as to save Hancock's distance.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A scout just in from the right says there is no infantry beyond Barlow's right but a cavalry force at Corbin's Bridge. Under these circumstances I have directed General Hancock to send Birney's division to Wright's left, when with Mott's division [now there] he will press forward at once between Wright and Burnside and endeavor to rectify our lines. This will leave our right as it now is.

MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-12.40 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: From what Comstock reports of the change of position of Burnside and of his [Comstock's] interview with Wright I have concluded not to move Birney, as with Mott there Wright ought to make a complete connection with Burnside, and it is better to have some force here available for contingencies.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Warren having made progress and taken some prisoners indicates the enemy were shaky. I have ordered him to attack at once. This will probably relieve Barlow and may assist Wright's and Burnside's attack latter.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
