Public Land?—Mr. C. Johnson
II. of Reps.
writings of any one leading politician, from youth to the grave,
through every vicissitude of government and modification of
policy, may spare himself murh reading and rejection, butt
much question if he will ever be able to render himself either
eminent 01 useful Such men are lin.e the mildewed and sickly
plants that vegetate beneath the shades of the ample oak, heai
mg neit icr charactei nor name They may treep aiound its
rough trunk, and eiawl to sume weak and decayed bough, may
ba occasionally cheered by some faint sunbeam, but they give
n > strength, and only obstruct the healthful air from the noble
tree
I like to see every public 01 private man tn this nation stand
mg elect lik  the natne forest tree and proudly supporting
himsell    It is such men who are lealiy the pillars of the Stale
Mr Jefferson was opposed to that feature in the Constitution,
before its adoption, which rendered the president eligible for
re election, yet, alLer the instrument was adopted, did Mr
Jeflerson refuse to serve a second term in the Piesidenry All
know that he did not
In the last powerful speech which Patuck Henry made in the
Vuginia convention, against the adoption ol the Constitution,
he said, if the Constitution were adopted, "My head, my hand,
and my heart shall be fiee to retrieve the los* of liberty^ and
remove the defects of mat system in a constitutional way J
wish not to go to violence, but will wait with hoi>c that the apn it
which piedommated in the involution h not >< t ^ont, nui iht
cause of those who are a tached to the íevol it on vet lost t í
shall, therefore, patiently wut, in expectation of seeing that
Government changed^ so a= to be compatible with the safety,
liberty, and happiness oí the people
What did Funck flemy sty aftei the Constitution was
alopted* When hu  own beloved Vuginia wasairavmg hei
self against the 1 iws of Congiess, Patrick Hemy, at the age of
sixty three, quit his repose and his letirement, to become a

I uther Martin made m addiessito the I c^islature ol Mai y
land stating with unpaiallel powei and ab hty why lie had m
convention, opposed the adoption oí the Constitution, which m
my humble |ud mcnt, ia mudt the ablest papei evei wutieii
against the adoption o( the Cons itutioo, but he di 1 not i cm
tate, as all well know who have read hi-> many nn ttily ai ni
ments, to give all of the provisions in that instiument, attei us
adoption a rational and effective construí tion
Under thi old Confeieracy Congiess wis not authorize! to
alopt an efficient system ol íevenue , it could levyquotis on
the .states,, but could not enfoice their observan* e It wis let
Wed us to commeice, and, in the langmgeot Chiei Tustue Iiy,
' Prior to the date of the Constitution, the people had not any
rational tul unal tw whu h thev could lesuit for jusu. e, t'iedí
tribution of justice was then confined to State judicatories in
whose institution and oigamzation the people of the other
States kad no participation and ovei whom they had not the
least contral There was then no general court of appellate
jurisdiction, by which the errois ©f tí ate couits affecting
either the nation at la ge or the citizens of any uthei State,
could be revised and conected. Each State was obliged to
acquiesce in the measuie of justice which anotliei State mi^ht
yield to her or to her citizens, and that even in c is swheje ¡state
considerations were not alwajs favoial le to the mo-it ex u t
measure There was dinger that from this source ammo ities
would in time result, and. as the uinsition horn animosities to
hostilities was frequent in the history oí indi pendent Site , a
common ti ibunal tu the teimination of conirovei&ies became
desirable, from motives both of jusucg and ol poney
'Prtoi also to that peuod the tmtnl States had by tax \°
a place among the nations of theeaith, become amenable to
the laws of nations and itwastlim inteie^t, as well w their
duty,to provide that those laws should bi lespecjedand obeyed
In their national charactei and capacity the United s ates wire
responsible to fomgn nations for the conductof each ¡state iel
ative to the laws of nations md the pei formance of 'reatus
and tneie the expediency ol refeumg all such questions to
Stat« courts, and particularly tn the courts of delinquent M it  - ,
became apparent Win e all me states *ete bound to pro tct
eac/i, and the citizens ol each, tt was highly proper and ícfts n
able that they should be in acipacity not only tin aust justice to
be done to each and the < ni/eris of each, but al o to c lusc ju=i
nee to be done by each, and the citizens ol each , and thitun
by v olence and force but m a stable, ^edate, ant1 legularcom p
of judicial proeedure  '
In more than one hundied instances hive the comts of the
I nion decided upon the a< i an t cluins oi the v nioii Sure
and of that number ftfiecn weie of \Utyla id—moie than ti m
any other State in the Union and of ill the old ^ ate" IHa

of unkindo*^ but as histoucal facts that teach a sahitan w un
mg    ISordo I wish to range ovei so expan ive a debate as
arose on front's famous land resolutions m the Senate where
the whole doctrino of State interp Mtion m 1 State sovereignty
was di->cuss,ed for months, with an ability nevei surpissed by
any delibeiative assembly    But, is \n American, I canno ie
gret that that di%u~-vion was had   I úo not legret it, beciiNe it
elevated the American name without destioym   the Ameiuan
Union, and opened a new and brilliant leaf m the volume of
American genius
It was a conflict, m my apprehension, moie sublime than the
warring ef contending elements It was a conflict of mind,
where mina met and subdued mmd The occunence t * which
I allude formed a new epoch m the history of tht«i na ion, ard
presented a spe< tacle of the highist subhmt'y Ido rot u e

of the grand pranie on fiie, which force-- the hea\ nn to rt fleet
its lurid light and fills the mmd with an idra of immensity of
íiame, of the pale and blue mountain crag, which UfU it"> as
pinng head to the heavens, as if to defy the tetioi of the light
rung and the thunders , nor of the wide and headlong cataract,
which i recipitate* itself from the feaiful height auuve to the
abyss below, dashes its angry wateis  into foam, and hmgo its

Dime! Webstei s great speech on that memorable occasion It
is the confluence of the Miesoun and the Mississippi, or the
silent meeting of the O hi > with the Mississippi There is no
awful terror there which astonishes reflection, no dreadful
noise that subdues the senses, but you ^ee the meeting of
mighty wateis you see a vast rtvu swallowing up, without
commotion, vast rivers you see that gicat mother of waters
tlnv ugon insuden and silent giandeur, as if it received no aid,
as ifn were unconscious that theie were othei streams You
are not amazed at its breadth, not its depth but you are awed
at its quiet, sublime silence, and powei Youi mmd is not
altimtd or astonished, but forced to reflect Itisthiovvn into

which has flown on from the beginning of the world, and will

it would benefit the Western Sutes, by holding out inducements
