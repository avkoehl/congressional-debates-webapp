General GILLMORE:

Thank you. I shall move up again with the monitors to-night. I shall be most happy to see you on board between 6 and 7 this evening. I shall start soon after that.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-9 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

My movement is postponed. It has just been reported to me that Sumter has fired several shots to-day, and operations were based on the supposition that Sumter was silenced. The enemy have also been at work on the obstructions during the day. The chief pilot reports that the line of obstructions has been added to, making a line entirely across the channel from above Sumter to Moultrie. The fire of Moultrie will be as much as I can attend to. I would ask if you cannot keep up a fire to-morrow on Sumter, in order to completely dismantle her?

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-9.45 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Sumter has not fired a shot to-day. My lookout, who has been on the watch all day, is positive on this point. His attention was specially directed to this matter.

It is the concurrent testimony of prisoners, deserters, and contrabands that Sumter was once effectually silenced. Nothing can prevent her remounting guns during the night, and she may have done so, but none have been fired to-day.

GILLMORE,

General.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-10.40 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

The officer commanding the trenches-who kept several men on the lookout all day, in order to warm his men to cover whenever a gun was fired-says Sumter has not fired to-day. I will open fire to-morrow, as you request.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-11 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

My chief pilot, who was up the harbor to-day, reports that he saw guns mounted on Sumter, and that they were fired. Your lookout may be correct, but if he is in error it would be fatal to my plans.
