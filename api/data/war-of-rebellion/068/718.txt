HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 13, 1864-11 a.m.

General WARREN:

Your sketch by H. Ricketts and your telegram to General Williams, are received. The order sent to you to advance a division was only embodying in an order previous instructions. It is not contemplated to attack the enemy in his present position, but only to press him by these advances, so as to ascertain his position, and be prepared to give him if he leaves his intrenchments and advances on us. Communicate with Wright on your left, and do not advance, as indeed you cannot, but connect with him so as to be ready for the above-mentioned emergency. Wright has been directed to send back Cutler.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 13, 1864-11 a.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch of 10 a.m. received, an I directed by the commanding general to say that you have already executed his instructions to feel the enemy. General Wright will be instructed to return Cutler's division to your command with as little delay as practicable.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

It seems to me if General Burnside would intrench himself in a secure position, with his flanks on Ny River, that we could safely cross the Po and get a battle out of Lee in a fair field. His so suddenly moving out against Barlow on the 10th shows he is nervous about this movement, and he keeps a considerable cavalry force over there to watch us.

Major-General.

Will you inform Dr. Milhau that he must move his hospital farther to the east at once. We may have to draw in our right tomorrow to re-enforce our left.
