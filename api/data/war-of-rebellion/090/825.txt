HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADIER, FIRST DIV., NINETEENTH CORPS, Berryville, Va., August 17, 1864.

Captain LEEFE,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, First Div., 19th Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report, in answer to your inquiry why the brigade of my command did not move at the hour appointed this morning: Orders were received to march at 4 a.m., and the troops were ready at that hour. About 3.45 orders were received to send one regiment ahead as advance guard. I detailed the One hundred and fifty-third New York, and they started at precisely 4 o'clock. Knowing that some time would elapse before the trains would be made up. I gave the men twenty minutes more to drink their coffee and fill their canteens, then started with the brigade and moved with all dispatch through the streets, which were blocked by wagons and troops of other brigades. I arrived, without very much delay, outside the town, halted a moment while the rear wagons of the train in my front moved out of park, and then proceeded on, without any delay to myself and without delaying others.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. L. BEAL,

Colonel Twenty-ninth Maine, Commanding First Brigade.

GENERAL: You were expected at this place this morning to join the corps; it is very desirable that you do so. The general commanding directs, therefore, that you move here at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain A. E. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have reached the cross-roads and find General Wilson's column going up the turnpike toward Winchester. The rear of his command is just passing. I have concluded not to send a regiment up the Opequon, as he will probably sweep that country.

Very respectfully,

ALFRED GIBBS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

No report from the infantry.
