the Uni ed States " He eontt nded that from the
very terms of tae Constitution, the«e lands or the
public te ntory v. ere recog it ed as the property o'
the United Sute*
He then went on to sho v tl>at, in his opinion, the
bill itself, by dictating ibe mode of the expenditure
of a part at lea,t of ne p'ccíeds, also as umed the
ground that n uas the property of Ibe Un ed
States, given as a donation, otherwise the grantor
had no right to direct the mode of expenditure.
He then proc eded to show the incompatibility
of such a principle with the doctrine rf State sovs-
reignty and St tie right, And then contended that
in cas,es where States were indebted, this bid, m-
s'ead of benefitipg the great body of th<- people,
would only operate chiefly to the advantage of the

explanations from Mr Howard in relation to es-

Mr. Cidlack had remarked that he must be
permitted to have sufficient confidence in the offi-

the gentleman from Michigan had objected on
that ground ye terday.
Mr Howard here explained, and ca'led upon

But if we di not lake the amount paid, and to be
paid, to extinguish the Indian title, it is still evident
the expenditures have exceeded the receipts. In
addition to all this, we might properly pharge the
12 nil    1-  )(l
land, wah the exp-nsrs of Ihe Florida war, ami
other wars growio  out of ihe defence of the public
domain.
Sir, said Mr. C it was one of the charges against
ihe late Administration 'hat it had Spent, I believe,
$40,000,000 m the defence of these land by the
(•honda war a'one, and the celebrated Buckeye
B aekimith, Bear had sa'el in a speech for a
Wfiii meeting m Mr B's district, that all that had
been accomplished by the expedition was the
"fruheniiig one old cquaiv to death, who would
have died m a lev1 days if she had been left alone "
Mr B referred to some other calculations, but the
Reporter cannot at this time follow these estimates
out
Mr B. then contended that if, as he believed,
thn land was the property of the United States,
Congres, had no more right to distribute the pro-
ceeds of the sales of it than to raise a surplus by a
cour,e of legislation affecting the tariff and the im-
posts of the country, and distribute that. Bui even
if that were to be done, the principle recognised by
this bill would only lead to a scramble between the
Slates as to who should receive ihe largest amount.
And he beseeched the gentlemen, if they were go-
ing to recognise th doctrine that this immense do-
main belonged to the S ates, and that the proceeds
were to be distributed among the Sutes, that they
would at leist lay do vn some gtncial principle
which should I e binding upon iheir future legisla-
tion that nothing would be left ambiguous or un-
certain He \wjid ask iheti to adhere to th8
prm ipU s reocgnioe' by the deeds of Ce sio3 fie

Bat why lalk < í di, rtbution when we have nothing
to di tribute—when we have an empty Treasury,
and the muttenngs of the storm of war are heard in
the dislance? We wou d be more properly em-
ployed m raising funds to fini h and repair our for-
tificat ons, and to urengtlrn the right arm of the
national I'efenee. It, on the other hand, they
adopted the sail more startling doctrine that the
Gemral Govtrnmant had a right to levy taxes for
ihe puipose of accumulating a fuid to be after-
wards returne ', by which ihe people should receive
