'ihe first remedy so ight in 181G by the esta-
blishment of a National Bas-^wassupp see, during
a few ensuing years, to have a?«.ravated those evi1 ,
and the next remedy, adopted in 1824 by a high ta-
riff, did not prevent the low prices and bankrupt-
cies Ot 1825, which coverei the country with
wracks and rum.
Undoubtedly, the Vest relief on such occasions is
to be ioand in removing the cause of the disease
So far as regards the General  Governmfnt, this
was attempted in 1837, and  since, by gradually
withdrawing from the use of banks and their pa
par in its fiscal opera ions, so as neiiher to stimu-
late nor c ntract their issues by other influences
than ordinary business, and by urging on  those,
who might find tbeir employment sometimes useful,
a clo er regard in doing it, to the safe and sober in
fluences of the universal laws of trade, a¡> well ? 
an inflexible adherence to the constiiuüonal stan-
dard of value
Wmle the General Government shall continue to
pursue such a course, it will mitigate and check the
evils which others produce, and which they alone,
under the limitations in the Constitution, aie able
entirely toiemove. At all event«, it will faithfully
perform a momentous duty, and exhibit a useful
example for imita ion.
In a period of peace and comparative exemption
from public debt, as well a-, from serious difficulty
in financial operations, it would hardly seem pro-
per to attempt more by assumptions of doubtful
powers, and by forced constructions in favor of
mea-ures by no means certain, if adopted, not to
aggravate rather than diminish existing evils, and
not to prod ice others of a c ¡aracter still more dan-
gerous Much less can it be considered respcciful
either to S a e right-, or ihe people, and certainly
not competent, in h  opinio of ihe undtrsi ncd,
to exercise such p jwers by < rra ing ijont) ed coi
poratiom aioon  them, wh ch many of their nnm
ber have repeatedly denounced asunconstitut onal,
and the authority to establish which was originally
refused rather than confit'el to the General Go-
vernment by the people and the States that formed
it. But some other powers expressly conferred
can, without question, be exercised furliei than has
yet been done by Congress, and in such a manner
as to produce very beneficial consequences upon
the currency. Still, it is hoped they will net cr be
pushed so as to trespass on ground really doubful
under the Constitun n, and prevent the States
from continuing to exerciss all the legitimate au-
thority ihey now po.sess as to banks at d debt ,
however much it may b> regretied that tublic
opinion has not yet run with more strength against
the abuses of both, and led to their prompt com c
tion. It is not proposed at this time to go into the
consideration of farther details on thtse points
But the dangtr lobe guarded against now, sttms
to be rather of an opposite cbarac er from that of
overaction by the General Government in the
exercise of us expíes, power-- On the con
trary, apprt hensions exist that it may not con-
tinue firm in the support of all which lias al-
ready been accomp ished in connection with the cur-
rency If it '■houlct not, and «hould thus not aid
to coirect m any desree ihe rashness ot rruny to
force something like a 'ormidable st am p Her
into all kinds of business, wi hout due guards t<
prevent cons ant and fatal explosions, myriad* of
individuals, as well as some corporations ai d
States, are likely to be overwhelmed in still wukr
mm, and will ere long probably Iook to no escape
except the application of the «ponge of a general
bankrupt law to all private lnbilit es, and the tm
constitutional assumption of the public ones by the
General Governn ent, so as to tax oppressively
tao*e portions of the community who have any
thing left to pay for the loss's and follies of the
rest.
A remedy which has been adverted to by some,
and which consists in ihe creation of more credit,
to cure the mischief of an existing excess of credit,
or the formation of larger banks w th like power
of abuses, in order to correct smaller ones, must
usnally aggravate the evil, and therefor*, where it
is free from constitutional objeción , may, 11 point
of expediency alone, well be discountenanced
A plan of free banking, adopted bj the Stales,
properly guarded and "ecured by p o* s ons s mi
lar to tnosi recommend d hy ih  uuders gn->d as
long ago as 1836, with such ot'ers as reflection
an 1 experience may sanction, appears far pr itra-
ble Bat, independent of that, no changes in the
present system, as to banks, ceem «or h/ < f s renu-
ous exertions, except thove whose direct < bj°ct shall
be to make safer, to restrict, control, and iegu ate
better the institutions that already exist rather than
to incorporate rrore Above all, should public
efforts be direced to strengthen t e certainty of
pronpt «pecie payments as to a'l notjs out, and of
a nearer approach to uniformity m the amount of
issues in similar sia es of trade, and of specie on
hand,instead of multip'ying them for speculation
or cupidity, and thus keeping up a succes^on of
expansions and con'ractions, which will only in-
flame the existing disorders, and render the continu
anee of great fluctuations in all pubU as wed as
private afairs nuavnJable, endless, and ruinous
With much respect,

To the Presidfnt of the Senate of the U S.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR
War Department,
December 5,1840
Sir- Smee my report of the last year en the se-
veral branches of the public serv.c committed to
my charge, the army has been actively and usefully
employed in Florida, and ot the Northern and
Western frontiers.
The design entertained by the Department, of
keeping the regiments entire, anr< roncen rating the
troops whenever it is practicable to do «-o, has been
p-i"-evered in with Ihe moU beneficial results A
ctmmercement has likewise been m?dr m esta-
blishing depots for the recept on a t! o recrnts of
ea"h separate regiment, where they may be dri led
and disciplined betore they are sent ell to their re-
spective btat ons in garrison or in the fiel<! The
recruit ought never to be sent to ¡cm h s company
on service, until he is thoroughly taught the duty
of the soldier, and this nstruction will be belter
given at regimental than at general < epot . By di-
viding each reeiment into two bodies m th1* man
ner proposed, every important statu n m the
country may be occupied, either as a p'ace cf de-
pot or a rendezvous of the íegiment, and, by a
proper distribu ion of the latter, the intermediate
lorts may be ttmp rarilj occupied by pan al detach-
ments, without npiry to the discipline of the whole
ccrps I cannot too stnngly urge the adipiion of
this method of dictnbn ing our hti'e army in time
of peace. To divide it into small pfrmanent de-
tachments will be to des'roy its eflltiercy and lis
discipline, and, in the event of war, to expose the
posts to be captured, and the whole rerular forces
of the country to be úseles ly sacrificed Apart
from that natural and well groun led jealousy
justly entertained against the existence of a large
stpn ling army in our country, sound policy and a
due regard for economy render  uch an e tabl s>-
meat altogether unadvisable, and it becomes rc-
cessary, therefore, to provide ether m°ans of de-
fending our nonhernand maritime frontiers aga nst
the dangers to which they would be exposed .it 'he
cor?menee neiit of a war None ohericcur to
me, than those Í have already iecommendcd, •m.
Cential positions tor the regular forces, from
which they coul 1 move upon any po nt of attack or
defence, and such an organ zatu n of the volun-
teer or mihm forces as would erab e lhem to
maintain th  posts in mst'd to ihctr charge until
relieved by the legular troops a system wh ch
ought tote matured in time of p'ace.
For the Western frontiers, posts, garrisoned by
regular troops, cannot be di penned with They
need not be very large, but they ought to be con-
structed of fire proof matenals, and in such a man-
ner as to be defensible by a small garrison
against any number of men not provided with artil-
lery A plan which will efff ct these objects per-
fectly has been devised by the Chief Engineer,
and been adopted The quarters for the men ought,
likewise,  be built of durable materials, and be per
manently furnished with iron single bedsteads, in
Iwu of the douDle and treble wooder. bunks now m
use This change, for obvious reasons, should be
v roduc d into ad tac barracks m the United
States
The chief and best position for the concentration
of troops, independently of the regimental r mdez-
vou«,is,for the Northern frontier, near Albany ,m the
State of New Fork, and near St Liui*, in Missouri,
for the Western—points from which easy commu-
nications radiate to every part of those extensive
hnes of defence, and whence troops may be trans-
ported with certainty and rapidity wherever their
presence may be requ red For the maritime fron-
tier of the Gu'f of Mexico, I would recommend, m
addition to the permanent fortifications planned for
Us defence, and now being erected, ihe establish-
ment of a depot, somewhere below the ¡alls of the
Ohio, for armed sea steamvessels This would
seem to furnish the best ireans of bringing the vast
power of the upper country to the defence of the
coast, and of using it, when there, in the most tffi-
cient manner. A certain number of vessels of war
might be kept in constant readiness, strong enough
to ewy a go d battery, and light enough to descend
the river at all season*, ana 'o cross the bars of the
Mississippi. The=e boats ought to be of iron, as
comb ning lightness, strength, and durability, and
might be constructed of the requisite si?e for about
fifty thousand dollars each Materials should be
collected for the construction of boats to be built of
wood, and stored until wanted; when, with the vast
resources in workshops and mechanics along the
shores of the Ohio, they might he put together in a
v ry short time and a fleet, equipped and manned
with the hardy boatmen of the Wes'ern waters and
a few ab'e-bodi d seamen, might be floated to the
ocean, fully equal, wi h the existing and contem-
plated fortifican ns, to protect the whole Gulf fron-
tiei The very able report on the defences of the
country, made by a board of di tingui«hed officers,
and submitted to Congre«s during the last sesión,
proves conclusively the absolu'e necessity of preserv-
ing and continuing our system of p-rmanent maritime
works of defence, and exhibits in the clearest manner
then superiority over floating batteries of any and
every descnntion In this view of the subject 1 fully
concur, and even think that the facility with which
our coas s and harbors may ba approached and
entered by steam vessels of war renders strong
permanent works more than ever necessary The
projectiles which will be u«ed in future wan
will, fioTitheti s ze and description, prove de
s'ruc n e to any wooden battery, and give an im-
mense advantage to stone walls over any fabrics
that can be penetrated by shells. It may be pro-
per heieio remark, that the capture of the castle
of San Juan de TJllos, at Vera Criaz, has led many
persons to suppose that stone revetments might be
destroyed by shells. This is incoriect. After that
event, I caused experiments to be made at Old Point
Comfort, by firing, at point blank range against a
stone wall erected for the purpose, the shells broke
against it, making very little impression. No
doubt, therefore, need be entertained of the ability
of our building materials to resist hollow shot I
do not thmk, however, tha the permanent works
should be the only de'enr-e relied upon, but re-
gard moveable steam-batteries as essential auxili-
aries Th°se cusht not, in my opinion, to
be lame vessels, but of light diaught of water,
cpable of cirrymg two guns fcr throwing
shills of eight or ten inches, diameter, and so
e< n tructed as to present a small surface to
the fire of an enemy These steam-batteries
should be manned by artillerymen, and be under the
command of the officer chareed with the defence of
the harbor fortifications, so as to ¡>ecure harmony of
action In order o test the prac icability of nsak-
mg bombicannon of the calibre oí ten inches, the
Chief of the Ordnance, Colonel Bomford, was sent
to Boston, where he has conducted a senes of ex-
periments with the most satisfactory results I re-
commend that these guns be adopted into the ser-
vice, and form part of the armament of our fortifi-
cabins, and of our steam fleating batteries. Some
successful expe íment have, likewise, been made
with war re ckets, and a machine constructed for
preparing them appears to answer the purpose per-
fectly
