[JUNE 18, 1864]-1.10 p.m.

General AYRES:

You must silence the battery in your front, so as to keep them from firing down our lines to your right, when we advance. If I get an order to attack with the whole corps I shall have you advance with the others. At present I am waiting for the attack to come up from our right.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, [June 18, 1864]-2.40 p.m.

General AYRES:

General Burnside and myself going to assault on our whole front at 3 p.m. You must move at that time against the works in your front. Any enfilading batteries on the left will soon cease as we advance. Have a brigade to cover your left.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-4.45 p.m.

General AYRES:

If you cannot advance from your position I shall have to get you to send a brigade, or part of one, to support General Cutler, to enable him to hold his advance position. Send the re-enforcements to report to General Cutler as soon as you decide you cannot advance your line with success.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND LINE, FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: Since leaving you, I have thought it best to make a different arrangement, one avoiding the necessity of withdrawing or changing the position of my troops most advanced. I shall now let my left rest upon the heavy works running perpendicular to the line of battle, putting troops in those works for the night. The enemy's works front favorable to their defense. In my opinion, if property defended, they cannot be carried by assault. Their artillery to-day was skillfully posted and handled. I turned three batteries upon one and failed to silence it. I lost some 40 men from one small regiment, the Eleventh U. S. Infantry, by that artillery fire alone.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
