to the left on a reconnaissance to move toward the Augusta railroad. After Colonel S[mith] had gone 600 yards he came up with the enemy's skirmishers, and he quickly drove them back to their main works. Soon he discovered one regiment of the enemy moving out to his left and another to his right, and he slowly fell back to our works. 9.45 p. m., received a dispatch from General Sherman stating that--

A heavy movement of troops is reported out of Atlanta, south through White Hall. Let your extreme left (Kimball's division preferred) feel forward strong and fire half a dozen shots with artillery in quick succession or by volleys, something different from the usual [way].

The above instructions were carried out by General Kimball, commanding the left division of the corps, at 10 p. m. The dispatch was telegraphed to him. Our demonstration of to-day held the enemy in our front and prevented any forces of the enemy from being sent to his left. We found the same batteries in our front and about the same amount of infantry that was discovered day before yesterday. Since that time, though, the enemy has made his skirmish rifle-pits much stronger, and in many places the pits have been constructed into a continuous line. We have lost about 400 killed and wounded to-day. Day very hot; cloudy part of the day.

August 6.-7 a. m., received report, by field telegraph, from General Kimball, commanding First Division, that the enemy was advancing his skirmish line and that he is re-enforcing his. 8.30 a. m., received another dispatch from General Kimball; reports that the enemy is evidently hunting for his left; that the left of his picket-line has been attacked, but it held firm, and the enemy is yet moving to his left. 8.40 a. m., General Stanley telegraphed General Whipple, chief of staff, a report of the enemy's movements,and then left headquarters for our left. 8.50 a. m., moved two regiments of General Wood's division toward the left as a support for General Kimball's left, that part held by General Garrard's dismounted cavalry. (General Garrard held that part of our lines which is refused on the left, commanding at Kimball's left and running along the old abandoned rebel works toward Peach Tree Creek, and which covers the road to Atlanta via the Howard house.) 11 a. m., a deserter comes in from the enemy in front of Kimball's left, and he reports that the enemy's demonstration was made by Maney's brigade, of Cheatham's division; that this brigade is posted south of the railroad, and that the enemy are very anxious to learn what force we have. Our picket-line was driven back a short distance, and we lost 1 man killed and a few wounded. 12 m., General Thomas telegraphed General Stanely that --*

12.30 p. m., telegraphed General Thomas that no attack, excepting one coming suddenly from the direction of the match factory on the Roswell road, can affect our position. Two regiments are guarding the breast-works on the Roswell road. 3.10 p. m., received instructions from General Thomas to order our batteries to demonstrate and to engage the enemy at all points along our lines during the day, as Schofield, who crossed the Sandtown road at 12.50 p. m., and attacked the enemy in his works without success, will make another attack this afternoon farther to the right. Instructions in accordance with this were at once given to the chief of artillery of the corps and to division commanders. Division commanders were instructed to make strong demonstrations and such movements and
