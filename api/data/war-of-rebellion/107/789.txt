HEADQUARTERS,Washington, September 5, 1862-12 m.

General F. J. PORTER,

Hall's Hill:

you will please retain Chaplain Walton until something more is known about the movements of the enemy.* General Sigel was directed to draw in the main line of his forces yesterday, so as to run from Fort Ethan Allen toward your right, and it was supposed that this would so shorten the line that he could connect with you. We are very short of cavalry just now, but will send you some soon. General Bayard will be directed to pick up stragglers.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS,Washington, September 5, 1862-12.45 p. M.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Upton's Hill:

General McDowell has been directed to send troops to relieve your command. As soon as your pickets are relieved, the commanding general directs that you put your command in motion, crossing the Aqueduct Bridge at Georgetown, and passing through K street, in Washington, to Seventh street, and along Seventh street to the park Hotel, near which you will find General Reno's headquarters. You will there report to General Burnside for orders.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 5, 1862-1.15 p. M.

General A. PLEASONTON,

Darnestown, Md.:

Your dispatch of this morning received.# A regiment of cavalry will be ordered from here this morning to proceed to Mechanicsville and there to receive your orders. I shall endeavor to give you another regiment to be sent to Rockville to-day, and there await orders from you. Bayard's and Buford's cavalry are entirely used up, and have difficulty in doing the little service now required of them. They are not available for your service. You must do the best you can with what we are able to send you.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
