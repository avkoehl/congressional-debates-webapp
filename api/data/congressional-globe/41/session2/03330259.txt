The Tariff—Mr. Maynard.

with our own labor, while the burdens of the
Government are sedulously and industriously
thrown upon the citizen, and that, too, in a way
to fall most heavily upon the laboring classes.
We have seen that more than one half the
proposed duties are to be levied from tea, coffee,
sugar, and tin, all of which, as has been shown,
are paid by the consumer, and are used more
largely by the laborer thau by his employer or
his employer's banker, while every article that
can by possibility compete in the market with
the product of his labor is carefully exempted.
Thus weighed down, American labor is left to
contend in our market as well aa in the mar-
kets of the world, with labor which either
enjoys little of these articles, or can procure
them duty free. And this is called free trade!
Lest I may be suspected of caricature, it is
proper to add that this project of a law is pre-
sented by the organ of the Free-Trade League,
and attention especially invited to it. The
principle is to levy duties from nothing which
competes with the growths and manufactures
of our own country, but in such a way and with
such discrimination that they shall fall heaviest
and principally upon the laboring classes.
Just here I will call attention to another
projet of a tariff submitted by the gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Bkooks,] found on
page 25 of the pamphlet copy of his recent
speech. He has, he says, a very simplified
plan to collect $148,000,000 in gold " on some
twenty-five or thirty articles, in lieu of the four
or five thousand articles in the present tariff."
That sounds well. His plan contaius some
twenty items, I believe, although I have not
counted them. Let us see what those items
are. One is " manufactures of cotton," 30 pet-
cent. duty. We know that under the present
tariff, instead of a uniform duty upon all manu-
factures of cotton, there is a higher duty im-
posed upon some than upon others, because
there is more labor in some than in others.
Another item is "manufactures of hemp and
flax;" another " woolen manufactures, cloaks,
dress goods, &c., including carpets, lelts,
&c.-> "Silk dress and piece goods, vel-
vets, and unenumerated articles" constitute
another item, and so on. The same number
of articles are embraced in each item that are
now dutiable. The main difference between
this scheme and the present tariff is that the
latter discriminates in the rate of duties acaord-
ing to the labor value of each article.
My friend would make his plan still more
compendious if he should reduce it to a sin-
gle item. Suppose, for example, he should
introduce a bill to this effect, " Be it enacted,
That on and after"—well, I suppose we will
say " the millennium," for I hardly think an
earlier date practicable—"there shall be
levied and collected on all goods, wares, and
merchandise imported into the United States a
duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem,.''' I suppose
that would yield enough to carry on the oper-
ations of the Government at that day, as we
shall have no wars and no public debt, in fact
very little Government of any sort beyond, per-
haps, the Light-House Board and marine hos-
pitals. That would be a tariff simplified to a
single item. The idea is not new. It is the
old horizontal tariff notion laughed out of this
House years ago.
why the domestic producer cannot compete
with his foeeign rival.
There have always been two obstacles in the
way of our successful competition with the in-
dustry of other countries, especially of Europe.
The first is the deficiency of capital. As com-
pared with Great Britain, for instance, the rela-
tive estimate in the money centers of the world
placed upon the public securities of the two
countries furnishes a fair test. With debts
not very unequal British 3 per cents, are
quoted higher than United States 6 per cents.
While somewhat must be attributed to a lack
of confidence, the result of repudiation prac-
ticed and threatened, still the difference is to
be explained by the comparative wealth, real-
ized capital, of the two countries. When,
therefore, the English manufacturer operates
on a capital worth but 3 per cent., while the
American operates on capital worth from 6 to
10 per cent., it is obvious that the latter is at
an immense disadvantage. This compels him
in a variety of ways to discount his products
and bring them to sale on a reluctant market.
To relieve this difficulty there has been a resort
to artificial methods of increasing the currency,
making money more plentiful. When money
represents property it is capital; when it rep-
resents credit it is not. And great as are the
advantages of an adequate circulating medium,
it cannot be made to supply the lack of capital
where there is none. All devices and contriv-
ances to that end are as futile as the many
problems in physics to create power by merely
mechanical combinations. Until, therefore,
we have the wealth of England we shall main-
tain an unequal competition with her productive
industry.
But the other and more serious drawback
upon our manufacturing pursuits is the higher
price of labor in this country than in Europe.
The fact is undeniable; the cause I do not
propose now to investigate. Appended to the
report of the Special Commissioner of the
Revenue for 1868 are tables purporting to give
the rate of wages in the United States and in
England earned and received by different classes
of workmen in twenty distinct branches of man-
ufactures. They show an excess in American
over English wages varying all the way up to
nearly 150 per cent. In Belgium, Germany,
and France it is believed that wages are even
lower than in England. Protection to Amer-
ican industry means, in fact, protection to
American labor. Compel our laborers to work
the same number of hours for the same wages
as their European fellow-craftsmen and I hes-
itate not to assert that our manufactures, de-
spite all other disadvantages, would, in the most
important branches of production—cotton,
wool, iron, steel, leather, and glass—compete
successfully with all the world. But in our
land the day of compulsory labor has gone, let
us hope forever, whatever form the process of
compulsion may assume. An effort has been
made, however, to show that the European
laborer finds compensation for his smaller
wages in the more moderate tone of his ex-
penses. For this purpose was appended to
the report just cited the following table, which
I could wish were studied by every laboring
man in the land. I give it entire:

It will be seen that the most expensive item
in the housekeeping of the American workman
is meat. This the Belgian does not afford; his
family has neither meat, nor cheese, nor tea,
nor eggs, nor fruits, nor oil or other light, all
of which the American enjoys. The relative
sums paid for house rent suggest a wide differ-
ence in their style of living. The trifling sums
expended by the Belgian for sugar, molasses,
spices, and vinegar, for coffee, soap, and starch,
for milk and fuel, indicate too clearly the nar-
row rigor of his household economy. It could
have been reached only by a necessitous study
of dietary minimums. If there be those who
believe that our workmen should be reduced
to this hand to hand struggle for bread, and
kept from the cradle to the grave face to face
with poverty, they will properly and consist-
ently oppose any protection to their labor. If,
on the other hand, they believe the laborer is
worthy of his hire they will so legislate that
he will receive it.
There is another disadvantage not to be lost
sight of in stating the case of the American
manufacturer. I refer to the public debt,
national, State, and local, the annual interest
on which cannot be much, if any, less than
$200,000,000 per annum. This enormous bur-
den is borne, directly or indirectly, by the pro-
ductive industry of the country. Of the entire
debt I estimate $1,250,000,000 to be held
abroad, makingan annual drain of $75,000,000
to meet the interest. This sum, unlike the
interest paid to the domestic bondholder, is
abstracted from the aggregate wealth of the
country and diminishes by so much the profits
of business.
Still otherbut minor obstacles mightbe men-
tioned as obstructing the success of our manu-
factures, such as the difficulty always attending
new enterprises, the lack of skilled workmen,
the habits of trade, the good-will attaching
to long-tried and approved fabrics, and the
prejudice, not easy to explain or account for,
