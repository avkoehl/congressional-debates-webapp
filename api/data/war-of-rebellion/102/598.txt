C. G. LAURANT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEBANON, MO., May 25, 1865.

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

Major Small has returned. The man that came and reported the rebels was a good man, and the one that sent him was a good Union man. He was some distance from the house, and saw some thirty-five men run on his house, and he took them for rebels; but it was Captain Chitwood and thirty-five home guards.

JOHN A. GIDEON,

Post Adjutant.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 25, 1865.

Lieutenant JOHN A. GIDEON,

Post Adjutant, Lebanon, Mo.:

I do not expect that there is any truth in the report of the rebels being north of Lebanon. All persons who bring in to your post false reports concerning the rebels, whereby the commanding officer is induced to run down the stock and wear out the men uselessly, will be arrested by you and sent to the provost-marshal at this post for trial. Citizens will report only what they know. You will inform them of this order.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

SUGAR LOAF, MARION COUNTY, ARK., May 25, 1865.

Major-General SANBORN:

SIR: I will, in accordance with your request, give you a list of the names of the men whom Doctor Hart murdered in this county last winter. Three of the Gardner boys, Dearlwoods, Thomas Fustby [?], whom they scalped [and] who were Confederate soldiers belonging to my command; also Jack Williams, and men by the name of Brown and Adams, who were private citizens at home attending to their ordinary avocations. John Ledford threatened to kill old Mr. Estis, of Yellville, if ever he could catch him, whom we all know as a good, orderly citizen. They also drove out all the stock they could find in Marion and Carroll Counties. The above facts can all be proven by the best citizens of these counties.

Respectfully,

J. A. SCHNABLE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Battalion.
