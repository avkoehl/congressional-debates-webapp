27th Cong- —1st Sess.                                 Tariff Dill—Mr.  Woodbury.__________                                      Senate.__
in favor of exempting them from duty, if conveni-
ent to him But, if he declined, Mr. W. would
detain theSrnate a few minutes, and only a few, in
stating what had influenced is a to make the mo-
tion.
In the first placr, these articles were not taxed
either to benefit the products of agricultural or
manufacturing labor. Neither came in competi-
tion with them We were, therefore, wholly re-
lieved from any considerations connected with the
principle of protection. On the contrary, the duty
on tea and coffee would operate unfavorably to
those engaged in manufactures, as well as those in
agriculture, because both of those classes, tn com-
mon with all others in the community, were con-
sumers of these great articles, and of course bur-
dened by taxation upon them
All, then, possessed a common interest in mak
ing them free, and a 1, he trus'ed, would unite in
making them free, unless the revenue proposed to
be derived from them was needed indispensably to
fulfil the public engagements, or to meet those cur-
rent expenses winch the respectabili y, usefulness-,
and honor of the General Government demande 1
Whatever those really did demand, he was wil
ling for one to vote—even to the taxing of leces-
sanes. But he was n< t wi ing to do this, if due
care and economy woull prevent the occasion lor
it—or ¡f the retaining our other rich resources in
the proceeds of the public lands msiead of lavishly
giving then away, would preven  it
This, then, is the gist of the inquiry under ih?
present motion
Is this lax on tea and coffee—t'"1 luxuries of the
young If you please—but ihe comforts of the mid-
dle a2ed—ihe solace of tht more advanced in life,
and ihe necessaries of the old—is this ta\ indispen-
sable?
Whether these articles, under all views, and at
all times, were or were not real necessaries-, did
not make so great a difference in tbi re^pec', as
whether, under the limit of 20 per euit i i ihe com
promise, we could or could not fa rcvcnui
enough lor an economical admmi traiion without
imposing some duly on tei crcff<e Becaus ,
if we would not, then we must tax even ncressanes,
or resort to more loans I admit, however, that
these subjects of almost universa1 i'*e wen once
regarded rfs luxunes, and so taxed But in the
progre sof wealih, comfort, and intelligence among
the middling an 1 poorer classes—which had el<
vated them so much higher in the social circle,
tea and coffee hid become, to almo«t all, a spec es
of necessaa s; and > hey rrqured ev mpunftom
duty when pi actieabl , nlm< st as mo has silt or
molasses, if looking to their wi 'i- prr id onstmp

general happi íes Yi t, u ider pros ing cirtum
stances, we ha 1 been obliged a' times to Ux ihe
greatest necessaries 13 n wer* we now, by iny
such circumstances, compelled to renew a tax op
tea and ct ffei 1
The Suiater from Kentucky hrd been so oblig-
ing as to iefer to a rrpoit from Mr W a' ihe
last session, in which, unci i c<r am events, it was
suegested ihat a and coflte ws ul I be among
those articles winch «e m s V be obliged to
tax2 Yes, sir, I then though , a d do now,
that these a tie es, though n  e la. ur.e , were
not to be now sine lv treitrt is such, ?nd
still were to be tax d if i* w?-. necessary to
raise so much under a ta lT as to < mbnee a t cle
of ihat descr ption in ordtr to t bid n he ind sen-
sible amount
I am hapoy to find ih.it my m'f> as to the chi
racier of th°se atticle>, 'encurred wi h tho e of the
honorable Senator, expressed as Ion" as:o as lt-32
He then remprked, m much better language than
I could select lor myself, that
'If the univei ality of the i e oí ot ject of c >r sumption le
termines then claasili u i (oííee tej til ¡ u ei tn tht, pe
sentcon lition of civi ize I =•   10 v  n ly be          i ¡ere ¡ nece^,
sanea Even if they ate i mines why sh t if I to the po r
by e teapemn* their pnces, tí that can be clilc et! be allowed
to use them?"
Hence, su, the articles of tei "nd coffee, only
now quasi luxuries to any, and substantial y or
practically among th° comforts, jf not necessaries,
of all classes, are not to be tax^d unless indefen-
sable to meet our imperative engagements.    But,
on the contrary, if it appear that we are not able
to meet those engagements except by taxing neces-
saries as well as luxuries, then you mu«t march
up to the urgency of the occasion, and tax them as
you already have, woollens, sugar, and iron. I
thought formerly, as I do now, and hope always to
think, that if you will not reduce your expendi-
tures as low as eighteen or twenty millions, and
do not expect larger importations than those
of 1838, it will not be possible to make the
ends of tho year meet without going b-yond
twenty per cent, duty on soms articles, or
raising the duty on others now free, including tea
and coffee—and that the only question would then
be between the preservation of ihe public faith,
and a moderate tax on tea or coffVe Between
those two consideration*, wien forced on us, I did
not then, nor could I now, Hesitate,
But I then stated expressly, as I now do, that
our expenditures ought not, in my opinion to ex-
ceed about eighteen millions a year in 1842. I
had expressed a similar opinim in the annual re-
port on the finances in the D-cember previous
And I «'ill think that ihey could safely aod pru-
dently be reduced to even It o nan eighteen tu or-
dinary times, and am ready at any moment to de-
sígnale the Hens and amounts of reduction under
each, which ippear to me feasibl-  I hen thou ht,
also, and then said, that probably ihe imports
wou'd be larger in 1842 and afterwards, than
they bad been in 1838 But it was necessary to
take some year as an illustration < f ihe computa-
tion, and therefore a new one, 1838, was ^elected,
as 1830 had been unusuillv high it was, nov-
ever, mtniiest then, as it is no i, ihat if our ex-
penses shoull not exceed eigi e^n riillions yearly,
ani tne imports prt\a >o be much lnrg r than
m 1833, no duty whatever on tea and coffee
would probably be necessary.
By the murh laiger amount of imports, as com-
puted by the Secrttary of the Treasury lor 1842,
no duty on them will benquuedm order to defray
eighteen or even twenty aillions of expenditure
Ilenct, id accordance vvilh the pnnc pie  I hav°
always entertained on this quesiion, andm avoid-
ance with sound views of political ecmeny, this
m< tion to make tea and coffee free ought to pre-
vail.
The only remaining inquiry, on this occasion, is
one of fact—ihat is, whe her the Secietary'  es l-
mita as to ibe revenue, or mine as to the pioper
amount of expenditure are either of them erro-
neous It becomes a question, on sound ec inomi-
cil pnnc pies, whether we could obtain enough for
■sil our reasonable wants, witheut ih? du its on tea
and coffee, or not "his mu-t d"p nd upon how
much we ought to exptnl yearly under tht. new
Ad mnislralion, so ndieal m its professions, and
hotv much we are likely to r¿C)ve yearly, wiihout
a (axon tae«e aitides, under us hign exp elation
as to a revival <f prosperity 1 shall toen, for rep-
sous s afed on several firmer occasions, suopose,
until Ihe contrary is shown, that the expenditures
in 1812 ougl t to be not over eighteen m Uto" , and
that ihe large rnports estimated at this se si n in
ihe Treasury Department, a d in the o'he- House,
may be probib'e Then we can assess 20 per
cent on onel undred and tweitj-fire millions of
duuable írnoort , and t^en tho nett revenue wouid
be over t venty millions To that, m the first half
of next 3 ear, theie will be added over two mill ons
before the last re iuetion takes effect, <n fit 1st of
Jul/, a'd after ihat, over a million more ftr the
augmertUi n fie i made by the home valuation
Tne S nator 'rom Kentucky will probably estunat-
ihe addition b, tne home valuation at e/en i lar
ger amount.
Tne whole icvet uefrom customs would thus be
over twenty thr*e mill ons aid to this only three
millions more for the lands, and you have a nett
revenue of more than twenty-six millions to meet
eighteen millions ot expenditure r ^j Ine iAnd^
because the bid giving ihe n away has not yet be
come a law, and ought not to. But if it doe, be
come a law ard is not repealed before a distribu-
tion is made, there wiM be still twenty-th ee mil-
1 ons of revenue to meet only what ought to be
eighteeen mi lions of expéndame That will
leave anexceis of five millions of revenue, so that
two millions on tea and coffee, as well as one mil-
lion on «ait and molasses, «an be dispensed with,
and still two millions extra be left to cover contin-
gencies and fluctuations, whether in receipts or ex-
penditures, oi in paying ihe debt. The duty on
tea and coffee can thus safely and prudently be
omitted I' amounts, at 20 per cent on an average
import, to only about two millions instead of three,
as supposed by the Secretary and oihers The
amount Drought in during 1840, of near twenty
millions pou ids of tea, was, from difficulties be-
tween China and England nearly double the ave-
rage quantity consumed here Hen~e, say ten
millions, at twenty-nine cents per pound, with the
ninety five million pounds of coffee, at nine cents
per pouud, and they would be together in value
only about $11,450 000 On this a duly of twenty
per cent, would yield, m the gross, only 12,290 000,
and of-nett revenue not much above two millions.
Place these, then, among the free articles, and
there would still be oyer twenty one millions of
revenue from customs alone to defray eighteen
millions of exp-ndi'ure I, therefore, have pro-
posed to go s ul further, and by anotheramendmmt
reduce the dunes on salt and coffee, next yeir, one
half, and in 1845, the other half, constituting to-
gether about a mi'lion.
If they both were free, as well as coffee and tea,
the revenue, on the imports above st¿ted, would
be likely to exceed the maximum deemed proper
for expenditure, as be ore computed, and h*nce I
trust that not only this mo ion will prevail, but
insure «ucce«s, also, to the other
I am u iwilhrg on tais occa ion, and at ihis la'e
period of the se<ston, to detain the Senaie a mo-
ment by coLafral and incidental matters I will
not add a word not necessary to present ihe e few
direct and plain reasons m behalt of tea ard cof-
fee. If any gentleman is anxious to exonerate
these articles from impost, and the people at large
from being baldened by a heavy <ax on them, let
him njt be deterred by any apprehension that our
expenditures may, by accidental and untoward
circjrastanees, beswcilen for a year ot two as
h v,n as tweniy-'hr ' million* Even in that event,
he can vole for tins motion with perfect safely, it
the procetds of tne lands are not finally given
away.
Thu , should that hwnot take effec', or be re
p aled at ihe next session, there w 1, wiihout a
tax on tea and coffee, be twenty three to twenty-
four millions ef revenue from b >th customs and
lands—b ing quite enough to meet the whole ex-
penditures, though increased by the interest on the
new debt and other unfavorable cau<es, to t«enty-
ihree millions
The first issje, t en, is, v 11 you retain a duty
on tea and cofiee, when it will not be needed at
all, if you only keep down the expenses to jighteen
or twenty million ' Or, in other words, are you
determined to ra s-e the cxpei.«es extravagantly, at
the "aenfice of tea and coffte?
The ne*i is uc is as follows. If you allow ihe
expenses, wh tl.er extra/agantly or necessarily, to
be swollen to twenty hree million", wul you not
keep ihe publ c lands and pay tie expenses with
their proceeds, ra her than tax articles of such wide-
spread consiimp ion among the masses of society
as tpa and coffee? Or, in different words, will
you, meiely for the purpose of gtung away the
rich proceeds of t'ie public lands, without any re-
ally ga nial result to the General Giverament,
the Slates, or the peop'e at !ar«e, si-, shown by mf>
on another occa i< n—will y u heap additional
burdens on those iln o> ire to continue their tem-
perate and humble t njoy ment of the use of tea and
coffee?
These, sir, are tn t-ue ques ions In the best
view it is a contest pe we n increase 1 expendilure
with tea ard coflet t ^e ¡, on the one hand, and
economy, with tea aid coffee fiee, on the o her
hand. In the worst vi^w, it is a war betwesn
gifirg away i ily, i¡ not mischievously, the whole
public lands, beside burdening heavily with taxation
tea and coffte, on the one side, and, on the other,
not giving the lands away, and not taxing at, a'l
articles of such universal u 9.
It is for the Senate to decide between thece alter-
natives.
