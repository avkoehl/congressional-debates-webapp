CAMP NEAR CORINTH, June 2, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

You will recall General Crittenden's division from the Memphis route to the Decatur road and push General Wood's division toward Decatur, repairing the road as they advance as rapidly as possible. It is possible that the original Army of the Ohio will soon move in that direction. You will make your arrangements on that supposition.
