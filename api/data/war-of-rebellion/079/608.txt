JOHNSONVILLE, November 2, 1864.

Captain Thomas C. WILLIAMS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forrest ordered all his forces into Fort Heiman yesterday morning for the purpose of crossing the river. General Buford had crossed, and went toward Pine Bluff. Don't know what force he had. From 300 to 500 men are on White Oak, supposed to be under General Bell; Weatherford, with about 300 men, is expected from Kentucky. No boats destroyed up to night before last; this is reliable. There is some force on the other side of the river; have not been able to find how large. Forrest has 5,000 men according to reports given by rebels to those they supposed to be reliable. The guerrilla Cox died this morning.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Lieutenant Commander King recaptured the Venus, with two Parrott guns and about 200 rounds of ammunition. I shall put the guns in position and use them. A force of rebel cavalry was seen about two miles below on WEST shore. I think the enemy came up on that side to conceal their movements and will cross to-night.
