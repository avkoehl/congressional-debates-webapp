tions could not be disavowed by the Government,
s'iou'd the) bv any accident be brought to light
But not so ot the acts of the aaent,generally lesi-
dent in tl iscitv.and nototiously in the confidence
ot the Executive and the deposit banks, bir,
when we considtr tlitt the surplus íevenue, in-
cluding the unt \pendtd balance in the Treasury,
will, dunng tlu present year, aveiage not less
thantlnity five,and probably foi ty millions, and
whin we bung to mind the immense influence
which the giatuitous use of this, cnoimous capital
gives to the Executive, besides the ordinary
pationage of the Government, it is time that the
country should awake to a sense of the conse-
quences Can public fieedom long resist the
assaults of such a tremendous influence when
brought tobeai.as we have just reason to believe
they are, directly upon the election of the highest
oncers ot the Government? It is not Biitisb
cap tal, u is not the money of the United States
Ba k, vv lother dealt out in loans or 1 irgessís
up hi particular individuals, it is the peoplt's own
money which is turned agunst them, to coimpt
the punty, and destioy the freedom of the elect-
ive iruicluse.
Have we not seen very lately by the proceed
ings of this House, that the pai ty feel themselves
no longer bound to pay even a decent regard to
the question of the propriety of reducing oi lim-
iting Executive patronage' The bill lately sent
us from the Senate, embraced substantially the
creed of the original Jackson party upon this
suo]ect. \et, sir, the idea of attempting to attach
any gieat importance to that bill, oi the subject-
matter of it, was openly del ided bv several leading
members of the party, and no single member of
it give it the least countenance except the gentle-
man from Virginia, who sits befoie me, [\Ii
Pvtton,] and even he qualified his approbation
of the measuie. \nother honorable membei fiom
Virginia [Mr Dromgoole] gave that bill its
quit tus in this House. It sleeps the sleep of
death in the tomb to which he has consigned it.
But does not every member of this committee
know that an honorable Senator from Tennessee,
and who stands in a very important relation to
the puolic at this moment, has been denounced
by the I aders of the party, and openly read out
of the Republican church by several of the leading
journals of the party, for his course upon this
bill After these bold and undisguised evidences
of the real contempt of the party for this whole
subject, who is so ciedulous as to be any longer
dtluded by their professions '
But, agiin is not the Senate, which was in-
tends d by the Constitution to be in itself a stand-
ing check and limitation upon the use and abuse
of the Executive patronage to that extent, and
as regards that purpose of Us institution .actually
expunged, and that, too, by executive power and
lnfucncc' I demand of gentlemen to answer me,
and s ty if there exists at this moment, practi-
cally, any controlling power in the Senate over
the will of the Executive? Is not the Constitu-
tion itself, for the time being, abrogated, sub-
vei led, overthrown ' All men must now see and
acknowledge that the duty ot sending nomina-
tions of public ofHceis to the Senate, foi advice
and connimauon, is reduced in practice to mere
form1 Have we not a Senate of the United States
notoriously replenished and oiganized upon the
principle of non-resistance, and of passive obe-
dience to the Executive will and authority ' And
how, sir, has this state of things been brought
about' The State Legislatures, those sentinel
towers, as they have heietofore been supposed,
upon the ramparts of the Constitution, and of the
public liberty, have been boldly entered, and by
Executive influence seduced and prostituted to
purposes of Federal power and domination ' Su ,
if the Executive Chief Magistrate had entered the
Senate Chamber sword in hand, and, supported
by a band of chosen mei cenanes, had daven the
obnoxious Senatois from their seats, and filled
ah the vacancies by members of his own appoint-
ment, he w ould have inflicted a deep wound upon
tht Constuution,and one which I know lit would
never think of inflicting, but it would have been
Policy of the Government—Mr. Bell.
I less dangerous, and more easily healed, than the
one which has actually been inflicted "Vet, sir,
all these things have been done under the influ-
ence,and in the name,of a paity which calls it"< If
republican, aid claims tobe considered the Jack-
son party'
It is well known that an unbounded respect for
the rights of the Slates was piofessed by the
original Jackson paity, and eveiy measure oi
practice of the Government which tendí d to con
sohdation, was denounced as inexpedient and
even dangerous. To prove how little itgnrd has
been shown by those who now weai the garb of I
Jacksonism, for the due constitutional rights and
independence of the States, it would only be ne-
cessary to call to mind the interference of the
Federal Government with the election of Senators
by the State Legislatuies, but, sir, I may add,
that the legislative proceedings of State Assem-
blies have been inteifered with, and many of
those bodies have aheady been reduced to the
condition of mere dependent and coordinate por-
tions of the great party machinery by which it is
supposed this country may hereafter be governed
—the supple and convenient instruments of the
Federal Executive, and paity interests '
How the pledge of the Jackson party to reform
those abuses, which, under the late Adnvmstra-
tion, were stid to have brought the patronage of
the Government in conflict with the fieedom of
elections, has been redeemed by the party which
now controls the course of public affairs, we all
know, and some of us feel Instead of an iso-
lated case of such conflict, which now and then
was supposed to have taken place during the ad-
ministration of the gentleman fiom Massachu-
setts, [Mr Adams,] we now have the practice of
such abuses reduced to a system, openly exer-
cised and openly justified by a large poitionof
the pai ty'
I must not omit to notice the course of the party
in reference to a branch of a great system of na-
tional policy, which was thought in the South
and Southwest to indicate the boundary between
the two great contending parties then in the coun-
try, more cleaily than any other I allude to the
subject of internal improvement by the General
Government It was supposed that this pait of
the policy of the late Administration was checked
by the celebrated vtto message of 1830, and hun-
dieds of the honest plantéis of the South and
Southwest entertain that opinion to this day.
Yet, sir, the truth is, that the expenditures upon
objects which in every light of íeason may be
fanly denominated internal improvements, have
actually increased under the action of the party
now in the majority in this House, and fai ex-
ceed the expenditures of the late Administration
upon similar objects I beg leave, as this is a
curious as well as inteiesting inquiry, to state the
amount appiopnated to objects of tins descrip-
tion each year of the present Administration, and
the amount proposed to be voted by this Con-
gi ess, which eveiy one knows is orthodox These
appropriations have been usually made in two dis-
tinct bills, and undei two sepaiate classes One |
class embraces the impiovement of haibors and
rivers, including breakwaters. The other, sur-
veys, roads, and, in the language of the title pie-
fixed to the acta, " certain works of internal
improvement " Under both these heads there
was appiopnated in the yeai 1830 the sum of
$525,523 48, in 1831, the sum of $732,482 44, in
1832, the sum of SI,252,658, in 1833, the sum of
$1,<J30,493, in 1834, the sum of $736,883, in 1835,
the sum of $652,377. It is proposed by the com- i
mittee of this House, organized upon party pnn- I
ciples, to appropuate to the same classes of ob- i
jects, at the present session of Congress, the sum I
of $1,966,328 92 The highest amount appro-
priated to the same classes of objects in 1828,
the last year of the late Administration, was
$250,805 26 Here, then, we propose to expend
$2,0110,000 duiing this year, or nearly so, foi one
of any former year. Sir, the party which sanc-
tions all this is still called the Jackson party '
But besides the open violation of these and
many other principles of the original Jackson
party, what are we to think of the strange, and
before unheaid-of punciples avowed by leading
membeis in the majority in this House, in the
I debate upon this bill'   Appropriations without

These, su, were to my eais, doctunes bolh new
and extraordinary, whatever confidence General
Jackson may be entitled to. They aie surely not
the doctrines of a Republic, much less of a party
which can justly claim the merit of exclusive de-
votion to republican principles. Yet these senti-
ments were distinctly avowed upon this floor by
more than one gentleman, and no member of the
party lose in his place to disavow and repudiate
them Even the ancient and famous Common-
wealth of Virginia, which has long stood the
boasted champion of the tiue republican faith,
could furnish no son on that side of the Howe who
dared to disclaim sentiments so subversive of
every principle heretofoie In Id vital to our Con-
stitution I am fai from doing all the individuals
composing the majority in this House the injus-
tice to suppose that they approve these, or, in-
deed, many other principles and pi artices of the
party with which they find themselves connected
I know how difficult it is foi individual members
to separate themselves fiom the paity wiih which
they act, upon any question whatever which as-
sumes a party complexion. I have often felt the
difficulty of such a course myself I behove, sir,
there are many individuals of the paity of the
majority in this House, who do not accoid with
the present course of the oarty to which tlu y be-
long upon man y questions—who can not long abide
their present party connections, and, sir, if I pos-
sessed the powei of exorcism upon tins occasion,
I would bid them instaiilly come out fiom among
the uncongenial elements and associates with
which they aie at present united
But we cannot be surprised at the avowal of
strange doctunes by the present majority, when
we íecollect that the single punciple upon which
the elections of the present day generally turn,
is unlimited devotion, not to any particulai polit-
ical creed, but to the party' Accordingly, we often
find members of this House, and leaders, too,
who eithei have no knowledge ot those punciples
which have heretofore divided the country, ot are
so entnely regardless of them, if tlu y know what
they are, as, in the same speech — nay in the same
breath, to avow themselves both lestnctionists
and latitudinanans, State-rights men and con-
sohdationists, thoiough Dtmociats and ultia
Federalists' And yet this is the natuie of the
association which claims to be the Republican
paity of the United States' 1 know of no instance
of equal absuidity and arrogance in the assump-
tion of names, except the one which recently
occurred in Pennsylvania, in which a State bank
took the name of the United Slates Built '
Sir, there is no one principle oi mixim, as far
as I can call to mind, avowed and professed by
the original supporters of General Jackson, and
which entered largely into the grounds of his
success, which has not been evaded ordisregaided,
and many of the most vital and important of them
have been openly, and, I regret to say, insult-
ingly, trampled under foot, in the face of the
whole country, by the party now uppermost in
influence, if not in power. In conclusion, upon
this part of my subject, I have to request of gen-
tlemen that they will answer my statements upon
this subject fairly—in candor, and specifically,
and that they will not evade the questions, and
content themselves by pronouncing fulsome eulo-
gies upon General Jackson, and by denouncing
all who do not subscnbe to every doctiineand
practice of the party which suppoits his Admin-
istration
Mr Chairman, I have not yet noticed the moat
