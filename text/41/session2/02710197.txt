As I said before, it is claimed that this
increase is made because of alleged frauds in
the importation of steel. I have no doubt that
fraudshave been committed by means of under-
valuations of imported steel. But vigilance on
the part of executive officers at the custom -
house and of the consuls at the places from
which steel is imported will prevent a recur-
rence of these frauds in future ; and these
alleged frauds do not seem to me sufficient
excuse for increasing the duty 1 cent per pound
upon the classes of steel most largely used in
this country.
There is a reduction of from J to 1| cent
per pound on another class of steel. But that
is not the class of steel which enters most
largely into consumption. What I complain
of is that on that class which is most used in
the country there is a large increase.
I call the attention of the committee to the
matter of steel rails, made by the Bessemer
process. Under the provisions of the bill steel
rails are taxed 2 cents per pound, or $44 80
per ton. The cost of steel rails in England is
§48 per ton; so that upon the original cost the
duty amounts to nearly 90 per cent. Now, at
a time when the great industry of railroad
building and railroad operating is necessary to
transport the products of one section of the
country to another section of the country, I
submit that we ought, in adjusting the tariff,
to see to it that in the interest of transporta-
tion we make railroad building as cheap as
we possibly can. It is known that this Besse-
mer steel is made by a siDgle process almost,
and that not a very expensive process after the
works are once erected. It is true that it re-
quires a large amount of capital to undertake
it, and I would not interfere with the success-
ful manufacture of Bessemer steel in this coun-
try. It is an important industry which ought
to be sustained; and while we are under the
necessity of raising revenue I would give manu-
facturers an opportunity of developing this
industry. But I ask, with the immense and
increasing demand for this product is it neces-
sary that we should give them a duty of $44 80
per ton as a means of enabling them to carry
on their business ?
The Bessemer is a patent process, the patent
for which I understand is about to expire, and
which has levied a large tax in the shape of
royalty upon all who made use of the process.
That patent when it expires will not be renewed.
I do not know whether the expiration of the
patent applies to this country or not; but I
think it cannot possibly cost twice as much to
manufacture Bessemer steel in the United
States as in England. The process is the same
and the material the same. I therefore pro-
test against this large increase of duty on steel
rails.
SAW.
I shall now say but very little with reference
to salt, because it has been folly spoken of
before. I only wish to add that I believe the
duty upon that article is unnecessarily burden-
some to the consumer and ought not to remain,
even upon the theory of the protectionists them-
selves. A dutyof 18 to 24 cents per 100 pounds
is imposed on salt. This heavy duty was imposed
to compensate for the internal tax of 6 cents per
100 pounds. This internal tax was one of the
first repealed, and yet t})is heavy duty remains.
In the name of protection we are told that if
a reduction is made the effect will be to destroy
the industry of the salt manufacturers. I hold
in my hand the annual report of the Onondaga
Salt Company, located at Syracuse, New York,
which shows that the largest production of salt
in the, Onondaga works, except in 1868 and
1869, was in the year 1858, when there was a
duty of only 15 per cent. This is a most interest-
ing and instructive table. It shows that in 1869
there were manufactured, in round numbers,
8,662,000 bushels of salt. In 1858, under what
was known as the free-trade tariff, there were
produced in the same salt works 7,033,000
bushels, being only a little more than 1,000,000
less than in 1868-69. Why should this industry
languish under a reduced duty when in 1858
it flourished with a small duty of 15 per cent?
It is an indisputable fact that in most instances
the price is enhanced to the full extent of the
duty.
The price of Turk's Island salt in New York
in 1860, February 11, was 17 to 18 cents per
bushel; on the same day of 1870 the price was
39 to 40 cents per bushel. In 1860 Ashton salt
was $1 70 per sack ; in 1870, $2 50 per sack.
Liverpool ground in 1860 was $1 15 per sack;
in 1870, $1 45 to $1 50. For these prices in
New York in 1860 I refer to the Shipping and
Commercial List; for the prices in 1870 to the
Commercial and Financial Chronicle. Both
may be found in the Congressional Library.
The same difference exists in all the leading
markets of the country.
If the Onondaga works in 1858, under a small
duty, produced nearly as much salt as in 1869
under a heavy duty, they ought not to complain
at a large reduction of the duty on salt. I do
not think it would be prudent to abolish en-
tirely this duty, but it should atleast be reduced
to 10 and 15 cents per 100 pounds, which would
about place it where it was when the internal
tax was in force.
SUGAIi.
I call attention to the provisions of the bill
relating to the duties on sugar. By the proposed
bill the revenue from sugar will be decreased
to the extent of about $10,000,000. In so far
as it will reduce the price of sugar this is a just
measure; but I fear the effect will be rather to
increase the profits of sugar-refiners than to
decrease the price to the consumers. Under
the existing law our largest importations of
sugar are of the class known as sugars not
above No. 12 Dutch standard in color, which
are the raw or Muscovado sugars, and which
are generally required to pass through the hands
of the refiners before they are fit for consump-
tion. This class of sugars now pays 3 cents per
pound. The first class above pays 3 J cents per
pound, a considerable quantity of which is im-
ported. All refined sugars now pay 5 cents per
pound, which duty is a prohibitory one, as no
refined sugars are imported. Thus, under the
existing law three fifths at least of all the
sugars imported pass through the hands of
refiners. This classification of sugar was'—^
in 1862. Under this classification a consider-
able importation was made from year to year,
known as centrifugal sugars, the sugars pass-
ing through a cheap process, by which the
color and grade are largely improved.
The proposed bill changes entirely the ex-
isting classification and admits all raw or Mus-
covado sugars at 2 cents per pound; and then
makes a new class called clarified sugars, or
those increased in value by means of the
vacuum process or other similar processes,
thus making a difference of 1 cent per pound
between raw sugars and those that are fitted
for use by this process. The effect of this will
be to compel nearly all the sugars imported to
pass through the hands of the refiners, allow-
ing them the profit arising from the reduction
instead of cheapening the price of sugars. It
is true that the duty on refined sugars is re-
duced to 4 cents per pound, but as the raw
sugars are permitted to come in at 2 cents per
pound a duty of 4 cents will be practically as
prohibitory as the present duty of 5 cents".
Mr. SCHENCK. Will the gentleman per-
mit me to interrupt him, his statement of the
purpose and object of the bill is so egregiously
wrong ?
Mr. ALLISON. Very well.
Mr. SCHENCK. It is not the first time the
gentleman has said that this bill is in the inter-
est of sugar-refineries. So far from that being
the case, for the first time we provide that all
raw and Muscovado sugars of every quality
shall come in at 2 cents a pound, instead of
3 cents a pound, as heretofore. We do not
make a distinction in regard to the degree of
color_ according to the Dutch standard, and
what is the consequence 1 Why, that the com-
mon people of this country who do not care
particularly about being driven to use refined
sugar, can get a fine, light-colored, excellent
article imported at 2 cents a pound, which they
have never been able to get before ; and it was
this very provision in regard to sugars whieh
we have reported in this bill which occasioned
at first a great deal of opposition upon the part
of all the sugar-refiners until they learned from
the committee that they had to submit.
Mr. ALLISON. I thank the chairman of
the committee for correcting me if I am wrong.
He tells us that the object of introducing this
provision is to allow all grades of raw and
Muscovado sugars to come in at 2 cents per
pound, whereas now there is a class of sugars
that pays a higher rate of duty than class No.
12 Dutch standard. Now, wliat is the fact?
The fact is that of all the sugars imported last
year, amounting in value to over §50,000,000,
$43,000,000 in value of those sugars came in
under the classification known as No. 12 Dutch
standard, and only about $3,000,000 in value
over and abovo that classification, and under
No. 15 Dutch standard.
Mr. SCHENCK. Allow me to say that there
was proof abundant before the committee that
a large proportion of that brought in at the
lower price was undervalued or brought in by
collusion with custom-house officers and ought '
to have paid the higher price. We have taken
away all possibility of that now.
Mr. ALLISON. Very well, I will come to
that point; I shall endeavor to treat this ques-
tion fairly. I know that in what I say I disagree
with the majority of the Committee of Ways
and Means. I regret to disagree with them in
reference to the facts of the case. But it is the
fact that of all the sugars of all kinds that were
imported, there were $43,000,000 of the char-
acter known as not above No. 12 Dutch stand-
ard in color, and between No. 12 and No. 15
Dutch standard in color there were imported
but $3,000,000 worth of sugar. So, admitting
all that the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means [Mr. Sciiexck] has said, he
has added only §3,000,000 to $43,000,000.
He tells us that there was abundant Drool'
