plunder our people, relying upon the citizen for all information of the enemy they ever get. Select bold and enterprising men for this duty, and harass the enemy as much [as possible].

It is of great importnce now to get information, and this can best be done by taking prisoners. It may be well to grive out amoung the citizen, and even your own commande, that my division from Richmond has reached here. Is General Ferguson your junior? If so, left him know that it is my order that he reports to you. All movements which affect Southwest Georgia he sould telegraph to General Marshall, at Millen, as well as to me. If you can leave your command for a few days I would like to confer with you here. If not, I will try to meet you [no] an appointed day, selected by you, on Brier Creek. I have heard many and bitter complaints all over the State against Wheeler's men. I wish you would issue orders, upon my responsiblity, to shoot all marauders.

With great respect, yours, truly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

AUGUSTA, GA., January 31, 1865.

General IVERSON, Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: You can get 400 Enfield rifles here. I have telegraphed for carbines, but will not get them, I fear. I am gratified at the capture of the sailors. When such captures are made the names of the capturing party should be given for publication. So instruct your officers. Get men, if possible, below the transports to fire on them. The nearer to Savannah that you harass the Yankees the better. I wrote yesterday explaining my views in regard to your retirement to Brier Creek. I would be sorry to wound your feelings, but still continue to think an error was committed.

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,[January 31, 1865.]

General IVERSON, Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I think it important that you should go to Hannon's assistance. So express my wishes to General Smith. Another brigade has gone up to Green's Cut and another (strong) goes up in the morning. I hope that Hannon will supply his men with arms from the Yankees. There are, however, 400 Enfield rifles at Green's Cut subject to his orders.

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
