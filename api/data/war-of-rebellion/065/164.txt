BATTERY Numbers 2., July 7, 1864-7.20 p. m.

I will place both the 10-inch columbiads at Pringle. The 42-pounder rifle I will place in the little work nearest Pringle, and not in Numbers 1. I deem it advisable to remove one of the 10-inch mortars from Fort Johnson to a hollow near Pringle, where it cannot be seen by the enemy. The enemy are shelling Pringle and our lines furiously, as well as the pickets. The Yankees are crossing small parties over the Grimball Causeway, and have intrenched on the peninsula from Legare's house to the causeway. They still have two lines of battle, but cannot estimate the strength, as they may string out or mass their lines without our being able to discover it. Artillery firing on John's Island, and the troops are ready to move for John's Island. Will you telegraphed at once if they go before dark?

Brigadier-General.

Major STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 9, 1864-12.55 p. m.

I telegraphed Captain Feilden all that I knew of John's Island this morning. The effect of the enemy's fire when I left the front a short time ago amounted to nothing, and we had reached the wooden boats. There has been only occasional firing since I left. I will communicate with you again in a few minutes.

Brigadier-General.

Major-General JONES.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 9, 1864-2.30 p. m. (Received 3.15 p. m.)

The fire of the Brooke gun at Pringle has driven the mortar-boat out of range.

BATTERY Numbers 2, July 9, 1864-10 p. m. (Received 11 p. m.)

The enemy are sending fire-rafts up the river, I think, to try to burn the bridge which crosses the StoNumbers I think they believe it could be used to bring troops here from John's Island, and that they will cut off our re-enforcement. Can you not send some troops here from the city? It looks as if they meant to try these lines to-night or to-morrow morning.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General JONES.
