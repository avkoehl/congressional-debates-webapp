FORT RENO, July 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General HARDIN:

I take very little stock in Major Fry's report. Colonel Crowningshield is just in and must have left after Major Fry's messenger. He says there is no enemy near him. No fires.

J. M. WARNER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

J. M. WARNER,

Colonel First Vermont.

FORT SLOCUM, July 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General HARDIN,

Fort Reno:

GENERAL: Captain Henry Hotopp, Company D, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, has just returned from a scout. He started out on the road from this point that leads to Flager's Run. He advanced one and one-half miles and then turned to south, leading to Bladensburg. He then turned directly to the east and advanced to within one-half mile of Silver Spring. Found no enemy with the exception of one squadron, say 125 men. Citizens told him the enemy encamped at Silver Spring during the night about 4,000 strong, and their impression was the enemy were falling back on the Rockville pike.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. C. MARKLE.
