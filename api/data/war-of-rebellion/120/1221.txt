labor of the prisoners. The purchase would have another advantage. All the labor bestowed and improvements made would be for the benefit of the Confederate States, and when prisons would be no longer required could be profitably employed or sold as thought best.

With this arrangement the prison at Andersonville, the prison at Camp Lawton, and the new prison, with the small prisons at Richmond and Cahaba, Ala., as receiving depots, would answer all purposes.

The ratio of mortality at Florence and Salisbury exceeds, I think, that at Andersonville.

I feel satisfied that if authorized to carry out the above suggestions I could arrange the prisons to the entire satisfaction of the authorities, and by that means relieve the Confederate States of all expense connected with the prison, except, perhaps, feeding, and to a great extent pay for that.

I respectfully ask that as early an answer as possible be given, as it is very important to know exactly what course will be adopted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.
