been driven in. Am now at Sixth Corps headquarters but am going back by Williams' house to get on the plank road. Will report what has been going on there as soon as possible.

W. W. SANDERS.

Captain, Sixth Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 23, 1864-5.40 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

The two brigades Fifth Corps are now near the Williams house. Duane and Hunt gone to post them with some batteries. Captain Sanders reports the cavalry pickets in front of your infantry skirmishers driven in. He says nothing of the other pickets. If the enemy has made such a detour as to get between you and the plank road you must turn on him and attack him at all hazards. Keep skirmishers and pickets well out on your left and rear, and send a staff officer to direct the brigades at the Williams house to throw pickets well out and connect with yours. Let me know promptly what is transpiring.

GENERAL: The attack by the enemy is on my left flank. He is feeling all along the line, but has not yet developed his line. I can make an attack. My picket-line has been broken in only one place.
