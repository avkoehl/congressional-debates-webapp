Honorable J. K. MOORHEAD,

Pittsburg, Pa.:

See my telegram to Governor Curtin repeated to Colonel Cross. Since then I learn that all the works at Rowlesburg and Cheat River are safe. I have communication and the railroad open all but twenty miles between Grafton and Rowlesburg. I have no confirmation yet of the rebel force extending to Morgantown, but it may be so.

If the colonel does not ask for a court of inquiry I think I shall have to submit the matter to a court-martial. Two bridges near Burton, on the railroad between Grafton and Wheeling, are reported to have been burnt by the citizens of the neighborhood. You will institute, if such be the case, a rigid investigation, to ascertain who were concerned in the act. If they were disloyal persons, who did it in aid of the rebels, they must be at once arrested for punishment. If they were Union citizens, who resorted to it as a means of cutting off the
