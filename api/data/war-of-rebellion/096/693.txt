HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 25, 1865-12.20 a. m.

Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Richmond Examiner of 24th says:

It is generally understood that some attack by Grant in this direction is anticipated, and everything has been put in readiness for any attempt he may make. It was thought that but for the heavy rain yesterday the enemy would have developed his intentions. The day before it was known that the enemy was again massing on the Vaughan road, and it was supposed that another attempt would be made to extend his lines on our right.

Does not this explain recent rumors of movements on part of enemy as well as Potter's report to-night? The paper will be sent you by an orderly.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

What reports do your latest deserters bring in in reference to movement of troops and evacuation of Petersburg, and what is the latest hour you have reports from the enemy's lines? Can you observe any change in the picket or main lines? Deserters on General Ord's front say that it is reported in their lines that Petersburg is being evacuated.
