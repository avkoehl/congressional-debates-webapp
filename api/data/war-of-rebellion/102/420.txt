WARRENSBURG, MO., May 12, 1865.

General DODGE, Saint Louis:

Everything is going on well at Lexington. A telegram from there asks if I will authorize the acceptance of Cy. Porter, not his men. From this I infer that Davis is driving him and that he has proposed terms. Porter delivered himself up at Memphis, took the oath, came into the State publicly, and was engaged in the raid upon Kingsville. Shall I give them the benefit of your instructions respecting bushwhackers?

I would suggest that if you can fasten upon any of such families the fact of their feeding voluntarily any gang of these outlaws that they be tried by the civil courts or military commission and if found guilty summarily punished. This course will have a salutary effect.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,
