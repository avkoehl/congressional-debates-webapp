of whom about two hundred were Missouri Volunteers and
feotes, and the rest regulars The Volunteers and %ies were,
formed imo a first line to make the attack and of the regulas^
five hundred formed a second line m the rear ef the vi lanteera>
and two*h mdiedmnre formed a reserve, m the rear of the
whole In this  disposmon of the forces it is clear thatih 
Vo'unteeishadadesperateserviceassigned them They were
to go forward as a forlorn hope to draw the p re of the hidden
enemy, and to absorb their bullets It was a service for regu-
lars, and not for volunteers—for soldiers by profession, and not
for fathers of families and sons of farmers, it was a serviré for
di*-c phr ed troops, and not for citizens fresh from tf c plough,
\v ho might have courage but could not have üiscipune The
en or of putting forward tw  hundred such troops on «ceh a
seivice while five hundred regulars remained íiehind m a
secor ' line, and two hundred mce w-ere held baekas a reserve,
is manifest to every observer and seems to assume the appear
a ice of 1 ^posing citizens to the late of a forlorn hope
Mr B was aware that volun-eers were otten sent forward to
skirmish and to bring on an action but this was not a case of
skirrm-hmg but of attack upon the position and mam body
of tbe enemv, lymgm wait to deliver a deadly fire opon tbe

Tne orders to the volunteers were to fall back if heavily pres

pressed They lost the one sixth of their number in a few ml
nntes ¡n killed and wounded including their commander, and
they tell back, some across the swamp and employed tbetn

others to the rear of the second line which ther jCmed, and
