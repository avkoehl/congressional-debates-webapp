SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Harrisonburg, Pa., August 19, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that General Halleck, by telegram of yesterday, directed me to forward you the inclosed copy* which was forwarded you last night by telegraph. Although my action has been disapproved by the Secretary of War, I cannot but think that had he known all of the circumstances connected with the matter, that a course similar to that misadopted by me was due to these misguided men, and would have been approved by him. They are not guilty in comparison to the leaders living in that section, who have taught them comparison to the leaders living in that section, who have taught them that the draft was unconstitutional, and that in resisting it they were acting in accordance with the Constitution. On leaving Bloomsburg I particularly felicitated myself that what had threatened to be a grave difficulty had terminated without bloodshed, and to the honor and dignity of the General Government.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Harrisburg, Pa., August 19, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that, nothing preventing my headquarters will be re-established in Chambersburg on the 22nd instant.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
