special order, which was agreed to
On motion of Mr CAM BRELENG, the House
then resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, (Mr Mason, of Vir-
ginia, in the chair )
Mr CAMBRELENGsaidthatitwashisobject
to avoid debate on thi=s question, if we v/ete to have
peace with them, which he sincerely hoped and
expected, the less that was said the better, if war,
the next Congress would have enough to say upon
that great question     As to the fiist resolution he
cared not for the form, provided the substance
could be preserved, and the rights and honor of
the country maintained     He would concur in
any modification which the House might deem
expedient     He should also, to secure unanimity,
disembarrass the question of our relations with
Prance by relieving gentlemen from the miserable '
question concerning the Bank of the United States  j
His sole motive in introducing that sulject was l
to show, not only to this country, but to Prance,
that, if driven into a war, we had the means of
carrying it on without recourse to faxes or loans.
He proposed that the third resolution declaring j
that preparation ought to be made shou'd be laid '
upon the table, as he designed to take a more ef  |
fective course     He should offer an amendment to I
the fortification bill, when returned from the Sen
ate, appropriating one million for the army and Í
two millions for the navy, in case it should be- j
come necessary before the next mee'mg of Con-
giess     This he understood would be all th it was
i squired by the executive branch of the Govern
ment    With these modifications he hoped the
resolutions would meet the approbation of the
House                                                                          |
Mr SPEIGHT called for the reading of the
resolutions presented by the Committee on Por   i
eign Affairs, together with those submitted   by I
the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr  Adams ]
The resolutions offered by Mr CAMBRE-
LENG, fiom the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
were then read as follows
" Resolved, That it would be incompatible with
' the rights and honoi of the United States further
' to negotiate ¡n relation to the treaty entere! into
' by Piance on the 4tn of July, 1831, and that
' this House will insist upon l's execution as rati-
' fled by both Governments
" Resohed, That the Committee on Foreign Af
'fairs be discharged fiom the further consideration
1 of so much of the Piesident's message as relates
' to commeiuil restuctions, or to repi sa's on the
' commerce of France                                                 ¡
" Resolved, That pieparation ought to be nade
1 to meet any emergency growing out of our rela-
1 tions with France "
The substitute proposed by Mr JOHN a
ADAMS was tnen also read, as follows
" Resolved, That the rights of the citizens of the
' United Slates to the indemnity fiom the French
< Government, stipulated by the treaty of the 4th
' of July, 1831, ought m no event to be sacnficed,
'abandoned, or impaired by any consent or acqm
' escence of the G n ernment of the United States
2 "That if the President of the United States
' should, during the interval before the next ses-
' sion of Congress, deem it not incom,wtible with
' the honor and interest of the United States to
I ' resume the negotiations with the French Govern*
' ment, he be requested so to do
3 "That no legislative measure of a character
I 'or tendency hostile towards the French nation,
' is necessary or expedient at this time "
Mr ADAMS said he wished the resolutions to
be taken up and considered senatun
The CHAIR [Mr Mason] suggested that the
latter mode would be for the gentleman to with-
draw all but the first resolution for the present
Mr ADAMS said it was a matter of indifference
to him what was the mode, so that action was had
upon each of his resolutions He did not wish to
bring this committee to a determination to vote
enmasse upon the resolutions of the chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations, or upon his
own, and therefore, pursuant to the suggestion
from the Chair, he would move his first resolution
as a substitute for the first resolution of the gen-
tleman from New York
The CHAIR theiefore informed the House the
question would be put in that form
Mr ADAMS wished to state as briefly as he
could the reasons which urged him to present his
own resolutions for adoption in preference to those
reported from the majority of the Committee on
Foreign Relations
He objected to the first resolution, because he
did not think the state of the country, and the
íelations existing between the United States and
France weie such as to make a declaration proper
that no furthei negotiation should take place Ne-
gotiation was the instrument of peace between na
tions, ard it was unanimously acknowledged that
the instant nations said they would no longei ne
gotiate, tlie only alternative, compa'ihle with the
nonor of nations, was war He did not think,
therefore, ihat negotiation ought to be foreclosed,
much less did he think it proper for that House to
declare that there should be no further negot anon
on thesubj'Ct Why, negotiations implied no con-
cession on the part of either House, and for that
reason his resolution was drawn in such a manner
as to declare in the most positive manner on the
part of the House that no concession should be
made upon this sulject [Mr A here quoted his
first resolution ] Here then the ground was tpken
Here was a declaration of peace to the woild, that
in reference to that treaty the United States would
I take nothing less 'han an absolute and complete
fulfilment, as far as was pos* ble in the nature of
things to obtain it     To that determination he for
i one was willing to acquiesce, and he hoped that
■ House was willing to acquiesce And if such a
determination should not be sufficient to effect a
conciliation, and to preserve peace with Frarce,
he was willing also to take the haznid of war
He regarded tl e interest and the honor of the coun
try at stake upon this question, and he wou'd call
upon aenJemen to leflect that the question was
very d ITerent from what it was before the treaty
was made It was not a question whethc y ur
citizens were entitled to this indemnity or whether
they should receive it or not, it was a question
whether this country would hold France to the
i sanctity and obligation of the tieaty that had been
1 made with hei it was also a totally different
question fiom any that had evei existed upon this
¡ subject before the eonclusio 1 of the treaty Be
fore the conclusion of the treaty, these claims were
unsettled and uncertain The French Government
had never admitted or recognised them Tne
amount was also uncertain The treaty in fact
was a compromise, and a most liberal compromise,
dthough the President himself has told us that
that indemnity or compensation was not adequate
I to the amount of the losses Now when the in-
demnity was expressly stipulated by that depait-
mept of the trench Government, authonzed by
Us Constitution to make treaties, and to pledge
the faith of the nation to all foreigners, the ques
tion for us was not whether we should get tl is
amount of money in behalf of our fellow citizens,
but whethei we should suffer the nation that had
made this treaty with us to violate it This she
would do if we did not take the light giound and
assert wnat was just There was now no ques
tion as to the justice of the claims, because the
Governmentof Fiance had admitted them    Theie
, was no question as to the amount, because that
was   admitted  also      The only  question  was,
I whethei you would hold a foieign nation to its
