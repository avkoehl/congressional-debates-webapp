TULLAHOMA, October 6, 1863.

General BUTTERFIELD:

The conductor says he can't haul another car besides the fourteen he has on his train now. Had I not better come on with the train, and send back for the regiments lying here?

JOS. F. KNIPE,

Brigadier-General.

TULLAHOMA, October 6, 1863-9.30 p.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

I brought the Forty-sixth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, part of Fifth Connecticut Volunteers, and One hundred and forty-fifth New York on the train of fourteen cars. The order to have my command at Tullahoma at 6 p.m. could not obey, simply because I had no trains to put them in. The total number of the above regiments is about 950.

JOS. F. KNIPE,

Brigadier-General.
