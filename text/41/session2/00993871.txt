enforcement of fifteenth amendment.
The SPEAKER. The House now resumes
the consideration of the report of the com-
mittee of conference on the disagreeing votes of
the two Houses on the amendment of the Sen-
ate to the bill (II. R. No. 1293) to enforce the
right of citizens of the United States to vote in
the several States of this Union who have
hitherto been denied that right on account of
race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
By unanimous consent it was agreed that there
should be two and a half hours of debate on
this report, of which the Opposition should
have one hour and a half. The gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Bixgham] is first entitled to the
floor.
Mr. BINGHAM. I propose to occupy a
very brief time in stating the substance of the
report submitted by the committee of confer-
ence. The House is doubtless aware-that the
Senate amendment, which was the subject of
the conference, included substantially all that
had been embraced in the bill reported to this
House by the Judiciary Committee, and which
had received the approval of the House. In
addition to that, the Senate amendment con-
tained various provisions for the enforcement
of certain sections of the fourteenth article of
the amendments to the Constitution. It con-
tained also a provision authorizing the Presi-
dent of the United States to employ the Army,
the Navy, and the militia, at his discretion, in
elections. It also contained a provision regu-
lating the imposition of taxes upon immigrants
by the legislation of the respective States.
And it contained, further, a provision giving
jurisdiction to the district and circuit courts
of the United States, concurrently with the
State courts, in all contested elections, save
elections of members of Congress and elec-
tions of members of the State Legislatures.
The report of the conference committee, in so
far as it changes the Senate bill, is confined to
the matters winch I have just enumerated, and
in the addition of two or three more sections
designed to prevent fraudulent registration at
all elections in the United States at which
federal officers shall be voted for, and also to
prevent fraudulent voting at such elections.
This statement, Mr. Speaker, places the
House, I believe, in possession of the changes
and new provisions proposed and agreed upon
by a majority of the conference committee.
Touching the power which was proposed to be
conferred upon the President by the Senate
amendment, to employ, at his discretion, the
Army, the Navy, and the militia at elections
in the several States of this Union, I beg leave
to inform the House that the conference com-
mittee have substantially struck out that sec-
tion and inserted in its stead a simple provis-
ion that the President of the United States
may employ the military force, so far as may
be necessary, to execute the judicial process
authorized by the proposed act.
Touching the provision of the Senate amend-
ment limiting the powerof the States to impose
taxes upon immigrants, I wish to say that the
only change made by the conference committee
is the change of the word "emigrants" to
"immigrants;" and that the only effect of
the section is to assert the power of the United
States, under the express provision of the na-
tional Constitution, over the several States of
this Union to this extent and no further, that
hereafter the taxes imposed by the several
States upon immigrants thereto shall be equal;
that the States shall not hereafter discriminate
against the immigrant from China and in favor
of the immigrant from Prussia, nor against the
immigrant from France and in favor of the
immigrant from Ireland ; that immigrants
being persons within the express words of the
fourteenth article of the constitutional amend-
ments, shall, whenever they may be found
within the jurisdiction of any of the States of
the Union, be entitled to the equal protection
of the laws, not simply of the State itself, but
of the Constitution of the United States as
well.
The additional sections to the Senate bill,
incorporated by the action of the conference
committee, are, as I have already remarked,
provisions to prevent fraudulent registration
and fraudulent voting at ail elections in the
several States of this Union and in the several
Territories at which a member or Delegate to
Congress shall be voted for. I do not deem it
important to explain at any length the pro-
visions of these sections; but I deem it due to
the committee to say that as to the constitu-
tionality of the provisions that have been thus
added, and the necessity for such legislation,
I do not allow myself to entertain for one mo-
ment the belief that any thoughtful man of
