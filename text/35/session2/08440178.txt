APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 15,
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Extravagance of the Democratic Party—Mr. Cragin.
Ho. of Reps.
reliable information. From Executive Document
No. 138, first session of the Thirty-Fourth Con-
gress, I learn that the two front dosrs, and their
outside trimmings, cost §47,072. The items for
each, are as follows: two figures, over door,
$6,260; bronze door, $13,200; and marble work,
$4,076 39—making, for both, the sum before
named. The designs and models for these doors
cost §12,000. From the same document, I find
that, by the original contract, made by Mr. Wal-
ter, before military rule prevailed, the front doors
were to cost about $600. I learn, also, that the
door which will separate the old Representative
Chamber from the entrance into the south wing
and this Chamber, will cost, according to esti-
mate, #14,416. This is simply for that part which
swings on the hinges. The design and model
cost $8,000. This latter sum was paid to Mr.
Randolph Rogers, and the work was done in
Rome. The door is to be bronze, and cast in Eu-
rope. The cost of sculpture for cast pediment is
#60,000. This is only for one wing. The other
costing the same, both will amount to $120,000.
Much of this is estimated cost. I have no doubt
the actual cost is much more. The models alone,
for pedimentof north wing, cost, in Rome, $18,000.
The design and model for figure to crown the
dome, cost $3,000. When the bronze is cast, and
raised to its place, I have no doubt it will cost
$10,000 more.
The costof marble, workmanship, &c., foreaeh
window, as contracted for by Mr. Walter with
Prevost, Winter, & Co., according to said docu-
ment, was |822 64. By the change made by Cap-
tain Meigs, each window actually cost about
#2,000; or more than double. By this change,
more than #100,000 was added to the cost. This
is only for the marble work. The windows them-
selves were separate things. I know not their
cost. I only know they are made of the best
white French plate-glass. The spread-eagle hand-
rails for the private stairways, in both wings,
cost $12,000. We have all seen one on the dark
stairway south of this Hall. It is now proposed
to tear out one of the committee rooms, on the
floor below, so as to let a little light shine upon
this railing. Such things should not be put in
dark corners. The painting of the agricultural
committee-room cosr. $5,000; that in one other
room, #10,000. How much the daubing in this
Hall and elsewhere cost, no one knows.
By a little calculation, I judge that there is
about three miles of polished Italian marble wash-
board, around the rooms and passages, in the
two wings. This cost over two dollars per foot;
or, in all, $32,000. This was not in the original
design. Ihavetried to ascertain about what the tile
cost; but cannot. It averages about one dollar per
square foot. The floors of the committee-rooms
and this Hall were first laid with tile, which is
now covered with costly carpets. A responsible
man in this city told me that the contracts for fur-
nishing the tiles were worth §100,000.
The contract for marble, to be used on the ex-
terior, provides for paying " sixty-five cents per
cubic foot for all blocks of marble containing
thirty cubic feet or less; and $1 98 per cubic foot
for all blocks of marble containing over thirty
cubic feet." It is well understood that most of
the marble was received in blocks containing
"over thirty cubic feet." I know of men who
think the Government has been defrauded out of
$500,000 in this way.
Fifteen months a o, there had been paid for
Italian marble $74,000; and for Tennessee marble
$52,000—making $126,000. This was its cost in
the rough. It has been used in the interior of the
building; and the cost of cutting and polishing it
for its final use must have been more than the cost
of the blocks. The original plan did not include
such finish.
The four grand stairways, two in each wing,
leading to the chambers and galleries, with all
their polished marble and embellishments, will
cost one million dollars.
I have gone into this matter further than I in-
tended ; but I cannot omit referring to a few other
thipgs, with which^we are more familiar. I have
before me the report of the contingent expenses
of the House of Representatives, made by the
Cierk on the 13th of Oeseinber last, and marked
Miscellaneous Document No. 4. As it contains
some rich items, the cost of some of the fixings,
and as the good country people may desire to
be informed of the republican simplicity of their
Capitol, I have concluded to present a few facts
from this document:
Furniture, for the Speaker's room.
Large French plate mirror, with elaborately carved and
gilded frame   $1,350 00
Large pier table    275 00
Mantel mirror    215 00

Picture frames, &c    25 00
Making $5,500 37
The furnished rooms in this wing, occupied by
committees, clerks, and as retiring rooms, &c.,
number about thirty. As a specimen of the cost
of furnishing them, I take that of the Committee
of Ways and Means, as follows:
Eighty-five yards of velvet carpet, at $2 50 $212 50
Making and laying same  24 75
Two office tables, at $33 cach  6(5 00
Committee table    85 00

Waihstand, marble top  68 00
1'itchers, tumblers, spittoons, and brushes.  15 00
Making   $2,749 75
The desks and chairs in this Hall, 260 of each,
cost the snug little sum of $47,000, and the clean-
ing and varnishing the same, since last session,
cost $1,156 60; the 18 lounges outside the desks
cost $1,980; the 8 lounges in the south lobby of
this Hall, cost $760; curtains for 43 windows,
in this wing, cost $6,345. I find here 10 mirrors
which cost, $5,470, and many others coating from
#100 to $300 cach. The carpet for this Hall, and
the laying of the same, cost $2,630 25; carpet for
the galleries, and fitting and laying the same,
cost $2,230; cushions, for gallery seats, cost
$2,359 50.
{ find that this House was supplied, during the
last session, with 285 English hair brushes, at a
cost of $425, and with 285 buffalo combs at $220.
I suppose the next annual report of the Clerk
will show about the same for this session. Eigh-
teen gold pens, supplied to members of the first
session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress cost $143 25.
If cach member had been supplied, at that rate,
the cost would have been $1,904.
There seems to have been more economy in
some things. I find by this report that one jug
cost only 25c.; one corkscrew 50c.; and two rat-
traps only $1 75.
The snuff account is small, and stands as fol-
lows:
Twelve bottles Maocabov snuff  $15 00
One half dozen bottle* Martinique snuft"  6 50
Tim teen pound* " American gentluman" snuft..,, 7 15
$28 65
This report shows that the present Clerk has
paid to L. F. Clark alone, for furniture, $54,628 31.
It should be borne in mind that all these expendi-
tures,and many more which I have notmentioned,
belong to the House.
I presume the side arrangements of the Senate
Chamber are still more elegant and costly. I have
not the documents to prove it. I know, however,
thattheyhaveoneretiringroomlinedentirely with
mirrors,and another with polished marble. With-
out intending to cast any reflections, it has occurred
to ine that if we had here a few mirrors, wherein
members of Congress, and especially the JLecomp-
tonites, could see themselves as others see them,
it would be money well expended, at any price.
I have examined somewhat into the cost of the
other public buildings in this city. I will briefly
refer to the Post Office extension. The original
estimate for completing that work, was $650,000.
And to show that this estimate was ample, I will
state that two responsible parties offered to con-
tract for the entire work, one for $547,000, and
the other for $575,000. This fact may be found
in the Congressional Globe. President Pierce de-
clined their offers, saying that the work was to
be done by the day, under the direction of the War
Department. Military discipline has prevailed
there also, under the command of Captain Meigs;
and the appropriations have already reached
$900,000. The estimates for the next fiscal year
call for$150,000 more. How much it will finally
take to complete the work no one can tell. Com-
ment is unnecessary. If there is nothing else
for Army officers to do, except to superintend the
construction of public buildings all over the coun-
try, I think it is high time that one half of them
should be dismissed from the service.
The expenses of this short session of Congress
are considerable. Including the salaries of mem-
bers from the close of last session to the 4th of
March, they are as follows:
Senate.
Compensation and mileage  $162,750 00
Employes  79,244 00
Contingent expenses  184,325 70
426,319 70
House of Representatives*
Compensation and mileage $580,250 00
Employes  86,748 00
Contingent expenses  385,464 60
  1,052,462 60
$1,478,782 30
To each of three hundred members, $4,929 27;
or, for each member for each of the sixty days of
this session, $82 15. Reform, as well as charity,
should begin at home.
I have some other items, but I think I have
said enough to show this committee and the coun-
try that there is {t rottenness in Denmark." The
expenses of the Government have swollen to an
enormous and unreasonable extent. The party
in power know that they are responsible for this
increase and extravagance. They have controlled
the Government for six years, and have added
thirty million dollars to the annual expenses. They
have run the nation in debt forty millions during
the last year, and now requite more. Alarmed at
this state of things, and knowing that the people
will hold them accountable for it, they are strug-
gling to make some slight amends, and escape
condemnation. Their councils are divided, and
the whole thing will end without any relief to the
country. The only thing that can bring relief, a
modification of the tariff, so as to encourage and
protcct home industry and home productions,
finds its most strenuous and bitter opponents
among that party which has brought this calamity
upon the country. Let us rejoice that the time is
not far distant when an outraged people will pass
judgment upon this party for its much wrong-
] doing. Its efforts to enslave Kansas are not for-
j gotten. Its subserviency to the slave-power is
j well known. That power, which usually con-
' trols the President, cannot now be controlled by
him. In his financial distress they abandon him.
It is as much opposed to any tariff policy that
will benefit the free-labor industry of the country
as it was m the days of nullification.
The ship of State must be manned by new of-
ficers and crew, from the Republican ranks, in
1860; and she will again float in the sea of pros-
perity, and carry rich freights to all parts of the
Union
