General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

On the urgent request of Generals Custis Lee and Ewell I have ordered out one-half of the local troops that had been recalled by details. It is next to impossible to get the men out, and great inconvenience must result from it. Cannot these local troops be recalled and the short line held by them be manned by extension of the forces on each side? The public service suffers much from their absence.

Secretary of War.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

SIR: Your telegraph to-day has been received. I shall be very glad to relieve all the local troops now in the trenches in front of Richmond,
