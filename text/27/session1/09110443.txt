Public Lands—Mr. Marshall
H. of Heps.
States, their credit, their interest, and their general welfare
The gentleman from Virginia, [Mi Wise] assumes, as settled
and moo «trove ruble, that Congress have no power o^er the in-
ternal improvement of the States, and, contending that the
money tobe distributed by this bill js intended to be applied
to that object, or to the payment of debts contracted rn thatac
éotint, argues th?t we are er-deavonng to do indirectly what we
are prohibited from doingdnectly. We-shall not appiopnate
ény thing to the connection of the several parts of the vastcoun
try whose commerce, foreign and domestic, we are appointed
to regulate, nor &hiil we distribute among the local Govern
mentaeven that which is their own, ltst they should apply it to
the development of those hidden stores which nature has every
where provided throughout tlnsf-ivored land, for the comfort
and enjoyment uf man, and only concealed that she might sti
muíate his industry, and invigorate his nature internal im-
provement cannot be carried on without revenue The States
are cut off from the easisstard most fruitful sources through
ditties upr-n cpmmeice Those who oppose this bill beem
i£o dread any inciease of the duties upon the part of the
General Govespment, lest there should be revived a protec
uve tddiff Vvnat are we to inferí It is that the General
Government has no powei but over war aid foreign npgotia
Uon* I& it that she is impotent in peace, without authority,
director mdneet.to advance the industry, facilitate the inter
course, strengthen the ciedit, and unfold the natuial resources
of the country] Is it that she shall be compelled to lean
upon the public domain, granted under theconditions which I
have shown, and to eke it out by direct taxation for the
revenue necessary to the execution of the slender and cir
cumscnbed powers which the argument leaves HÍ Are
the Sates prohibited from raising revenue from commerce"?
and shall the General Government leave idle and unexerted
the sovereign and most productive power of impost and duty
upon eurhatiade as ours—a power expressly and exclusively
granted—about which even strict constructionists cannot dis
pute, and throw the national expenditure upon the same re
sources, to which and to which alone the States aie allowed to
look for revenuel Is she to abandon what is exclusive, and
resort to what is concunent, and what will be sufficiently bui
dened hy State necessities foi a Ion? time to come? And for
what reason? Are we to abandon the clearest dictates of eco
nomical finance lest, by the imposition of duties upon foreign
commerce, incidental protection should flow to American m
dustry? lest, by restoring to the States property originally
their own, and ceded toa common trustee for their own use
and benefit as St te", their credit should be strengthened ana
they enabled to ptesecute those great domestic works whicn
they alone, according to the argument, have the light to pi ose
cute? Ims Government must not lean upon the customs for
its expenditure, although they be exclusively by the Contain
tion a national fund for national purposes, because, by ^o do
ing, they will leave other branches of revenue, to which the
States are entitled, concurrently, untouched, and thu*, by the
action of th.s Government in the choice oí resource", tne States
may be permuted to do for themselves that which we aie told
the General Government cannot do directly Sir, is not «hi* a
strange argument forState Rights gentlemen to eujp'oj'i Can
it be better answeudtlun by the statement of it* Gentlemen
from the Somh have not always reasoned thus The leader of
the State Rishts party, the distinguished Sanatoi from S iuth
Carolina, [Mi Calhoun,] once held that the General Go\ein
ment had the power over internal impiovements undei the
right to make wai His great and expanded mind devised and
recommended a general and ma n fkent plan of intercommuni-

Government s ir-h an exemon of us powers and such a direx

s tength and carnal aie altogether inadequate, dooms the peo-

foieign and domestic, to the phe, yet cpmpels the other to fur
rush unaided the highwaysoftrade and transportation, military
as well as commetcial, may be friendly to State rights, but is
exceedingly unfavorable to State powers and interests Gen.
Jackson conceded the prmcrple, so far as the right to distribute
levenue among the States is concerned, to an extent fat be
y°nd w-hat is claimed by this bill or its advocates He denied
to the National Government the power to dnect and eontrol
the internal impiovements wuhin the terutoiy of the particu-
lar States, but was willing that it should be the collecting agent
for the S ates, leaving to them the right of expending and ap-
plying treasure which they are constitutionally incompetent to
raise I have said, sir, that I did not go this length, nor is it ne-
cessary that I shou'd.
Fortune, a most propitious and singular fortune, has placed
at the disposal of this Government a fund, an enormoub fund,
independent of taxation, to which we have shown the States
have something very like to sti ict title Eight hundred millions
of acies of !an 1, at one dollar and one quarter per acre, one
thousand millions of dollars—think of that, sir1—tobe applied
gradually and upon a pnnciple of strict fedeial equality to
the extinction of State debts, iothe extension of State improve
ment«, to the support of S'atecredit! Oh ! who can «-ay, sir,
that this measure is hostile to the rights oi the States as sepa
rate communities'? And this fund, too, conferí ing ten times
its own value upon the individuals from whom it is drawn,
and opening up new perennial and unfattiomable fountains of
revenue to the Government which distributes it' Who shall
say that it i<¡ inj tmous to the power or the Hiteresu of the peo
pie as a nation, orto fcheir National Tieasmy? This picture
is not overdrawn—not in the least It is the advantage, the
peculiai advantage, of peopling and bringing new and fertile
land into cultivation Raise money in any othei way, or from
any othei source, and it is taxation Sell any thing else, the
product of hu nan art or labor, below its value, and you are
either rohbed by the vendee, or you rob those from whom you
derive it. But ¡and, vacant, unsettled, unpeopled, ferule, un-
cultivated land, is the crea'ion and the gift of God When you
sell it for the one tenth of its value you have enriched your
selves to that extent from the munificence of Heaven; and he
who purchases has made one thousand pei cent upon his m
vestment You enlarge the national capital a thousand-fold by
the very act of fil mgtheNational Treasury, and, af the same
time, and by the same opeiption, extend incalculably the
souicesof future revenue JHut, su, álthoueh all th'sistiue,
strictly ai d philosophically true, and (he individual is enriched,
American population muea^ed, the national capitd-1 enlarged,
and the National Treasury filled by this pi ogress of emigraron
and settlement, still the money thui piofitahlv mvet'ed is

ritorial ¡units and jursdiction of the States to which it is
given and is, by the existing law, exempt for five years from

tum faster than the older States of the Union So that the pro

The section which fixes the maximum price which tbe Go-
vernment shall demand during the existence of the laws at the
present minimum of SI 25 per acre, has met with the severest
denunciation    The wisdom and piormetv of this piovision
seem to be equally manifest with the policy and justice of the
p «ceding The great national object is to promote as fast as
possible the settlement, real and bonit fide^ of the public ¿fo
mam, and so to keep down the price as to place comfortable
faims rtuhm tbe reach of of the poorer class of emigrants, tfn 
dei the distribution law, the necessities of aoraeofthe older
States, or the jealousy of those who imagine that emigration
drams their population, and ascribe their own declinej ©r=at
least inert ness and stagnation, to the rise of the Western States,
might induce them to raise the price of lands so as to cheek the
advance of that population which the General Government is
most interested in extending 1 he one would kill the goose
that lays the golden egg to get the treasure, the other would stop
the national growth, m'the vain hope of increasing thereby their
own particular importance. Against either result, or either
motive, the piovlsion is aimed, and wisely aimed, as it seems
to me.
And hete, Mr Chairman, I beg leave to differ, not only from1
the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise J hut from myassoci*
ale in this aigumenr, the gentleman from Noith Carolina, [Mr.
Rayneh ] I cannot asenbe the want of pi ogi ese, or at least the
vei y slow advance oí population and resources m the Carolinas

try When wis emigration ever known to dimmish population
at home, all things else beine right theiel Did emigration to

of the States from whence they have principally drawn their

depends upon the amount and character of the industry employ-
ed, and the remuneration it receives Population and labor

which have neither commerce nor manufacture, and whose
ngncultufeia earned on by those who have neither a property
in the soil nor interest in its production, if they find themselves
sinking mto poveuy and weakness, must look for the cause else-
whei e than in the pi osperi ty of communities differently situated.
But this is dangeious ground, and I quit it
Finally, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] conceives
this bill to conveit the public lanue into a fund of univerpal
conuption Sate*, old and new—coiporations and mdividu

wiongs and indignities, to pm^trate their lights and their in-
dependence at the footstool of European monarchy lest, m
case oí war, they should lo=e their annual shaie m the distri-
bution of the proceeds of the public land*. It seems, then, sir,
that the ereat objection to the bill is the universal benefit it
confers" Every diss of persons, natural and political, find
their advantage in it Could a pruut'ei commendation be
