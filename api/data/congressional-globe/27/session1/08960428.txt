Case of McLeod—Mr. Everett
H. of Reps.
earned on the present jaiosecution to screen himself, and there-
upon the Court, m consideration of the umeasotiablenesa of the
prosecution and the uncertainty of the time when another admi
ralty might lie he!d,admi ted the saii Jackson to bail "
Bac Abi 35, tide bail in civil cases a>o if a man be con
victed of felony, upon evidence by which it plainly appears to
the court he is not guilty of n, he will be let to bail
6 Mol In Kirk's case the principle was admitted, though
bail wag refused
ISal 104 J S being commuted on an indictment for niur
der, moved tu be bailed, Kokeiy and TuTton weie ¡oi bailing

seem to them sufficient to prove mm guilty ÍFolt C T and

enough, «fee
2 Str Oil Rey vs Dutton In thi«s case, the case of Lord
Mohun, cited in the opi )ion of the court, is leferrcd to The
Chief Justice said ' that L jrd Mohan's case was at Lord Holt s
chambers ind not ni co irt as, the books repoi t it, and that the
Lords baued him aftei indictment for muiuei was found "
"In Rex vs Acton 2 Str 851, (as cited by thecoiuu) The
prisoner hid been t ied for muidei, and acquitted Afteiwnrds
a single justice of the peace issued a wairant charging him with
the eame miudei, upon whieh he was again commuted On
an. offei to slow th^ fotmet acq uttal in the clune&t manrei,
the court iciu>ed the pi oof Oi trn« case the couit, says
Mr Chitty, laid down the ru'e that the court will not look
into eitrtrisic evidence u all fhib case is mis-stated It
was not a committal for tlie sanio oíFei ce, but ior another
offence "
The sensible rule on «.he «ubject of bail or disthaige, after
indictment foi murder, ig foi the court to jefuse b til or dis
chargt upon ¡ íoof th it is susceptible oí being contravened
When, howmei, the evidence is of that certain and positive
character that it cmnot bi gainsaid—whethei it show tba inno

the offence, asa fotmer acquittal, producing me peison alleged
to have beenmurdetcd thve, s ¡owing that the homicide was
committed m battle m tmie ot wai, or on the high seas or in a
foreign countiy in each case pioved by evidence that could not
he gainsaid
in the presi nt case, the evidence is therecoids of the Depait

It is not necessaiy to pingue this branch of the subject further,
as, on the second giound, the couit decided agnnst the immu
nity claimed by McLeod, in whatcvei mamiei or foim it might

Vattel, B m c 4, i 67 ' A wai, lawful ard in foim, ¡scire
fully to be dimmer i i hed from an unlawful war, entered in o
without any form, or lather, from those incm&ioiis which die
committed either without lawful nuhoii y o appaient cau=e,
as likewise without formalHiebj and only or havoc and ] lilage

rates lo the bameda s belong almost all the expeditions of
the African corsairs, though authorized by a sovereign they

wars, lawful and unlawful, aie to be carefully distinguished,

Thus Vattel divides all the hostile collisions of nations into
"two sortsof wai^," the om without nppaunt just cau^e and
íor havoc and piliace, and all that do not come undei this head
being of the other ton The ñot he c ills un'awful wai, the

that this authoiity, in its fullest extent, apphesto the htstiie

which belongs to soldiers engaged m lawful wat by the com

a war which is unjust on the paitof the soveieign who makes
it, but lawful because not undertaken without apparent just
cause and for havoc and pillage, says
" But as to the leparation of ^ny damage, arethemilitaiy, the
