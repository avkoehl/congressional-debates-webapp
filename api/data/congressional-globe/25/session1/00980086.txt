CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
in ease the expiration of the term was unforeseen
by ti e State of Ai Kansas, and his term of service
being determined by lot was unforeseen by
the Legislara e of Arkansas The clause of
the Constitu i n, in relation to the House of
Representatives was without this limitation and
restriction, and b-mg so, he con'ended mat it com-
prehended all cas s of vacancy which might occur
This, he contended, was the plain evulebt meaning
of the framers of the Constitution I) this was not
the meaning of the framers of the Con-vtitutn n,
why was there a distinction between the t«o claims
The great principle of cur Government is, that the
people are capable of self-government, andhe argued
that whether the election vv as held under the forms
prescribed by the law of the State, or under the writ
of theGovernoi, it was equally valid In his view
of the case, he believed that the framers of the
Constitution placed limitations and restrictions
upon the clause in relation to filling the v acancy of
Senators, because that they vv ere to be appointed bj
the Governor of the State, but hid left the clause
m relation to representatives imrestncted, because
they went back and received their appointments
from the source of all power—the people, and
the framers of the Constitution, very properly
liad placed no restrictions or limitations upon
the people He argued that the Constitution
contemplated that the Legislature of the several
States should make general provision for the hold-
ing of elections, but the laws of the States piovided
for the holding of special elections , and, from the
very nature of thing?, this cannot be regulated by
law, because it cannot be foreseen This case,
then, could not be foreseen by the Legislature , and
therefore it was nothing more than justice to the
people of Mississippi that they should be represent-
ed on this flooi The people of the State had chosen
Messis Claiborne and Gholson as their íepresent-
atives, and it was not for us to tell them that they
wer° to have no representative  in the House of
Representatives
Mi TOWNS dissented from the report oí tV
committee, on the ground that the Legislatme i i
the State alone had the right to piescnbe the
times, places, and manner, of holding election"
and failing to do so, it was the duty of Congress to
provide for the case He took it for granted that
there must be some uniform rule by which mem-
bers were to be elected, and known here as mem-
bers of this House He contended that where
there was a law affecting that subject, that law
must control the subject There was a Ian , then,
of the State of Mississippi, declaring that the elec-
tion for membi rs of Congress should take place on
the first Monday in November, biennially, and the
members here claiming seats were not elctied
under that law He had examined this subject
with his feelings favotable to Ihe gentlemen from
Mississippi, but his judgment told him thej «ere
not elected in pursuance of law, and, consequently,
were not entitled to seals on the flooi of the House'
Mr ROBERTSON contended that ihe pr clama-
tion of the Governor was illegal, and con«eqi cnll;
the election must be illegal, and argued, that if the
Governor had the power to fill the vacancies by is-
suing his wuts of election, that the Legislature
could not exercise the power
Mr CAMBRELENG ihen called for the ordeis
of the day, but withdrew the call at the request of
Mr GHOLSON, who moved that the repoit of
the Committee of Elections be posti oned to Mon-
day next, and be mide the special ordei /or (hat
daj after 12 o'clock He made this mi hon with
the hope thit by that day every gentleman wni'd
hav c his mind made up one w ay or the othei an 1
that the question might then be decided
Mr CLAIBORNE said it wis cleaned b, him-
self and colleague to h-  e an eaily d cis on of 1,1 s
question He did not merely ask ¡tfor ti em¡>e]\e<¡,
but the} cons derail it as due to th" people of Mis-
sis ippi, that this question ■«ho ild be ac'ed upon
He hoped, inasmuch as this wis not an ordinary
contested election, but depended entirely upon a
question of constitutional law, that all parties in '
the Hou«e would consent to have the subject made
the special order of the day for Monday, and then
decide upon it finally
The motion to postpone to Mondav, and  make
the report the special older foi that day, was agreed

now will he evn i e the payment el hat fourth in-
stalment1 Sir, I navp not seen h s plan I hav e not
discussed this matte with a s ngle officer of
the Government ror any friend of the ad-
ministration I nave had no consultation with,
nor have I ever seen, on the subject, a single offi-
cer of the Government, noi have I ever lauded one,
from the Piesident down, but I venture to predict,
that if this fourth 11 stdlment be left to ti o execu-
tion of this officer—I say I venture to pr d ct, that
its execution willpioducc far more embarrassment
than its suspension can
Mr Speaker, the provisions of that act—the de-
posite act of 18SG, I mean—are peculiar They
give, in certain contingencies, power to the Secre-
tar} of the Treasury to call back the three instal-
ments already distributed, under certain limitations.
Sir, it is a power wh ch you yourself, by *he verv act
which you clesue to enforce by refusing to pass this
bill, place in the hands of the Secretary 0f the
Treasurv What will be the result then of defeat-
ing this bill1 "Why that v ou leave it a claim upon
the Treasury, and that b solemn discussion, and
solenn vote 1 ejecting this bill, voumakeit the
lmneratite duty of the Secretaiv, to execute the
depos te act to its ve y lettei
Now, sir, look at the proposition They say the
Treasurv is embarrassed, that it is redi ced, and
that it will want funds, then how will the deposite
act be executed1 Why the S°cretarj must, of ne-
cessity, call upon tne Slates for the thiee instalments
airead} made But suppose, as gentlemen say,
that the Treasury is full, and that there are
ample funds xa its hands If this be true
what a spectacle will be ptesented to the 'im-ncan
people' That your Secret try of the Treasury, y our
autnonzed officer, has presen*cd a set of siatemenis
to this House and to the country which aie utterly
false1 Can any administration stand under
the scorn and indignation this would piotmce
amongst an outraged people, when Congress
meets in Decembei and fin 1 his statements
a thorough delusion' But I doubt it, sir
It is ni} sincere impression that the Trea-
sury is embarrassed, and that if }ou reject
the bill on }Our table, vou place not only the
States, and the tieasunes of the States, but the
State banks dl 0, which gentlemen wish to protect,
at ihe m°icy and under the contiol of the Secre-
tary No v, =ir, I put this to gentlemen arc tney
prepared to see this deposite act executed to 1 s let-
ter, and especially uncer the existing pressure1 Are
they prepared to pay back the three mstalme its'
Undei this specific provision of that acl, I know
the c >urse the Treasury w ill pursue—01, at least,
what 1 believe it will pursue It is this T at it
will, if the fourth instalment be paid ovei at all,
throw the expenses of this Government upon the
States, by diawmg upon them for the three other
instilments, and the inevitable resu't will be, that
you compel the Treasur, to lely upon the S ates to
suit at and sust un the General Government
Tiis vill 1 reduce rroie pressure than will be
I ¡educed b} the suspension of tne act of 1S36,

on deposite out ot the nine and a half icquired to
pay the fourth instalment What vvul be the re-
sult? \oxx w ill compel the Secretary of the Trea-
sury to call upon tho«e banks to pay up so
as to enable him to execute that paymer-i. Look
at Ohio, having more now than she is en-
tiled to under the fourth pavment Do vou

Again, sir, suppose this bi l be "ot passed, what
will be another result? That }oucall upon the
Secretary of the Treasury to enforce the law, or
