I certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the original on file in my office.

ROBERT J. T. WHITE,

Secretary of State.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, June 8, 1864.

Captain R. D. MUSSEY, U. S. Army,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of yesterday regarding recruiting in Kentucky is received. You will confer with the Adjutant-General of the Army on the subject. He will be at Louisville by Saturday next.

By order:

C. W. FOSTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General of Volunteers.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, June 9, 1864.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF KENTUCKY,

Frankfort, Ky.:

SIR: By comparing the monthly returns received from your office with those received from Major W. H. Sidell, chief mustering officer of the State, a discrepancy of 1,716 men is found to exist, viz:

As per reports received from your office for--

January, 1864 .......................................... 750

February, 1864 ......................................... 401

March, 1864 ............................................ 170

Add report for March ................................... 315

Add report for February, March, and April .............. 941

For April .............................................. 323

--------

Total .................................................. 2,900

Per reports from chief mustering officer for--

January ............................................ 115

February ........................................... 313

March .............................................. 149

April .............................................. 707

-----

1,284

-------

Difference ............................................. 1,716

This difference (1,716) cannot be explained, as no returns have been received from Major Sidell covering this number. None of the reports received from your office have been countersigned by him, as required (see Note 4, on blank form), and therefore it is impossible for this Department to give the credits claimed.

Early attention is invited to the foregoing, so that the difference, if any, may be adjusted.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
