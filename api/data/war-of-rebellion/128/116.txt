merely to secure the valuable aid of the adjutant-general of the State in carrying that policy into effect. The only objection to the order you propose is that it conflict with the conscript act in restricting the maximum of infantry companies to a smaller number than is allowed by that act. The right to volunteer before enrollment is reserved by law, and the order to Major Mallett only applies to enrolled men. Orders have been given for the immediate filling up of the Virginia and North Carolina regiments at Richmond, because the enemy are preparing to attack the city a heavy force.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, October 11, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD,

Charleston, S. C.:

Take possession of the coin of the Bank of Louisiana in the hands of W. H. Young, president of the Bank of Columbus, Ga., and place it in the hands of John Boston, the depositary of the Government at Savannah.

A written order will be sent immediately, but don't wait for it.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, October 11, 1862.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: In reply to your letter of the 29th* ultimo I have the honor to say hat the Executive has no power to make Confederate money a legal tender between individuals. Government supplies may be impressed and paid for in Treasury notes, and if individuals within the theater of your operations discredit the Government money they may be considered as hostile to the Confederacy, and may be arrested and removed from the vicinity of the army.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, S. C., October 12, 1862.

Hon. G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

Order relative to Bank of Louisiana funds will be obeyed. Would it not be more prudent to send them to Augusta, Ga.?

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:

See General Beauregard's suggestion. What do you think of it?

G. W. R.
