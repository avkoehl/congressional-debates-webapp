WASHINGTON, August 2, 1864--10. 30 a. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Frederick, Md.:

It is believed that no force of the enemy was in the vicinity of Rockville yesterday, except, perhaps, a small number of Mosby's guerrillas. General Grover's brigade will move out on that road as soon as we can get a cavalry escort. I think Lowell's old regiment should be employed in picketing the Potomac River and pursuing these guerrilla bands.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MONOCACY JUNCTION, August 2, 1864.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, August 2, 1864--3. 30 p. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Monocacy, Md.:

General Kelley defeated the enemy last night near Cumberland, and drove him back toward Old Town, on the Potomac. Can you not push forward Averell's cavalry to cut off his retreat?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

FREDERICK, MD., August 2, 1864--8. 45 a. m.

(Received 9 a. m.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT:

Hunter says please give him something definite about the force of rebels reported at Rockville. He is all ready to move, but does not wish to start until he knows something more definite. Please answer quick.

McCAINE.

CAMDEN STATION,

Baltimore, August 2, 1864--10. 10 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Our agent at Wheeling reports by telegraph of last p. m., received this morning, that the enemy, said to be 2,600 strong, was then approaching Cumberland by the Frederick pike, and that General Kelley met them between two and three miles from that city, and commenced a battle about 3 p. m. yesterday. The agent states he will report the result as soon as known. This is the only advice we have upon the subject. I trust our cavalry force in pursuing the raiders will form a junction with General Kelley, and aid in protecting Cumberland and the region west.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
