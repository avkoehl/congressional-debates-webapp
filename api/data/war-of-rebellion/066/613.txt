I am at a loss to afford re-enforcements unless from the reserves. Major Basinger's battalion might, on need, be substituted.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

CHARLESTON, August 19, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

[Paragraph XIII], Special Orders, Numbers 192, 1864, leaves some doubt as to whether Augusta is in this or Hood's department. Has a commander been designated for that post? One is much needed. A raid has just started from Sherman's army. Please bring case of Jacob Lovell, sentenced to be shot, to notice. Forward my letter of 11th. Example much needed at Savannah. Can I get Lieutenant Swinton's men, of Company B, Twenty-third South Carolina, of whom I spoke to you?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted to His Excellency the President for his information.

General BRAGG:
