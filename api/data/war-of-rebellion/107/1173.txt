a pretty heavy force, if they do not flank me. A detachment of cavalry move over to our left, which I am watching. I will keep you informed of what occurs.

FREDERICK, July 7, 1864.

Major-General WALLACE:

I have abandoned the pass. Am falling back toward Frederick. A strong skirmish line of at least 250 men advanced on my skirmishers, which I could not spare force to meet and protect my flanks at the same time. A mounted force of at least a squadron moved to the left and an equal force to the right to turn my flanks. I will report anything that may occur. I think a force has gone through on Harper's Ferry pike. I will be in Frederick in two hours.

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

FREDERICK, July 7, 1864.

Major-General WALLACE:

The enemy have so much larger a force than I dared to suspect them of having that on their advance I had to evacuate the pass, and now have posted my men back of the city, and the enemy are in our front.

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Colonel.

HEADQUARTERS,Monocacy, July 7, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

Colonel CLENDENIN:

I have no ammunition for Sharps carbines. If there is any danger of the force getting out of ammunition, it must retire by all means while you have enough to retire on. I have sent directions to Colonel Gilpin to send out mounted men by Baltimore pike to see if enemy are trying to cut off line of retreat. If so, to retire by way of Monocacy Station.

By order of Major-General Wallace:

MAX. WOODHULL,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Consult Colonel Gilpin immediately.
