HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT, Shreveport, June 3, 1863.

Major General RICHARD TAYLOR (through General Hebert):

Lieutenant-General Smith directs me to say if the reports of our successes at Vicksburg prove to be correct, our communication with the east side of the Mississippi must be at that point for forwarding and receiving supplies. Under the supposition the enemy have been driven from Vicksburg, he wishes you to have the railroad from Monroe put in running order as far as practicable; he also wishes you to send an agent across the river to gather and forward as rapidly as possible supplies of any kind that may be there for this department.

HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT, Shreveport, June 3, 1863.

Major E. SURGET,

Asst. Adjt. General, District of Western Louisiana, Alexandria:

MAJOR: Let me thank you for your letter with the Natchez extras. I have no fears for the result of either Port Hudson or Vicksburg, and believe General Taylor will arrive opposite the latter place in time to complete Grant's destruction.

Our couriers from Natchitoches are only nine hours en route to this point. Dispatches take from two to three days from Alexandria. Stations should be established every 10 or 12 miles between Alexandria and Natchitoches, which will bring your headquarters within twenty or thirty hours of Shreveport.

Many rumors and reports are said to be in circulation in Alexandria,
