THE CONGliESSIOJSTAL GLOBE.
January 29,
my part I would change the tariff, not destroy
it, so as to bear more lightly upon this great
productive industry of the country. I would
take it off entirely from those articles of neces-
sity which are consumed alike by the rich and
the poor. I would take it off from tea and
coffee and .sugar and salt, and I would reduce
it largely upou iron .and other articles which
enter directly into the consumption of the
masses of the people. I would do this in the
interest- of a constituency almost entirely em-
ployed in agriculture. But while I would do
this I would not wish to destroy or even par-
alyze other industries. I do not believe that
it is for the interest of the farmer to do this.
On the other hand, I would build up and pro-
tect all the industrial interests of the country
whenever I can do it without direct injury to
the people that I represent.
But, Mr. Speaker, I did not rise to speak
about the tariff, but about the monopoly of the
carriers of the country. Sir, the present de-
pressed condition of agriculture iu the West
is not owing to the tariff; it is owing to the
extortions of a few soulless railroad corpora-
tions.
To-day three or four gigantic railroad corpor-
ations hold the interests of the producing classes
of the northwestern States in their hands.
This great farming interest is entirely at their
mercy. We must pay all that they demand for
removing it to market, or let our millions upon
millions of bushels of wheat rot in the gran-
aries of the producers.
The wheat crop in Minnesota for the year
1869 is estimated at 18,500,000 bushels. This
crop ia sold by the producers at the various
railroad stations at about fifty cents per bushel.
At the same time the article commands $1 '20
to SI 25 per bushel in New York.
Here, then, we have a tariff of from seventy
to seventy-five cents per bushel upon all the
wheat that the farmers of our State have to sell.
1 suppose that Minnesota has a surplus of
about sixteen million bushels. At present
prices this crop is worth in New York about
twenty million dollars. Out of this sum the
patient, toiling people who produce it receive
about eight million dollars, and the extortion-
ists who carry it take the other $12,000,000.
Now, Mr. Speaker, 1 have no doubt but that
these railroad corporations, taking advantage
of the necessities of the people, and through
their unholy and wicked combinations, charge
one third more for carrying this wheat to market
than they ought to charge. I do not think
it would be difficult to show that at least one
third is unjustly extorted from the prudueer.
Thus is Minnesota alone, on the single item of
wheat, robbed of $4,000,000. Iowa is iu almost
as bad a situation. She must have more than
twenty million busheis of wheat. But this iast
State has a more diversified industry and does
not suffer so much. Wisconsin is in the same
situation as Minnesota. Tliis State cannot have
less than twenty million bushels of wheat for
exportation, upon which she is obliged to pay
an extortionate demand of not less than four to
five million dollars. Missouri a,nd Kansas are
in pretty much the same situation.
The surplus of these States is not much less
than seventy million bushels. At present
prices the cost of transportation for this is not
much less than fifty million dollars. At least
one third of that sum, or $16,000,000, is vir-
tually robbed from the people of those States
by the mammoth railroad corporations for the
removal of this crop for a single year. This
sura does not include the cost of carrying the
freight that is moving from east to west..
I see by the report of the Committee on Rail-
ways and Canals, made to this House in June,
1868, page 8, that in 1802 three railroads moved
westward through the State of Illinois four
hundred and fifty-six thousand one hundred
and fourteen tons. Now, it cannot be less
than one million tons per annum carried by
these railroads from the East "to the V. est.
Mr. Sneaker, it is evident, to every man
wiio lias paid any attention to this question
that this great interest of agriculture, more
important to the country than all the other
industries combined, is not only entirely un-
protected by the Government, but it is left to
bo robbed and plundered by organized char-
tered monopolies which, through tho munifi-
cence of the Government and by unjust com-
binations, have become strong enough to bear
down every interest of the people with which
they come in contact.
1 was a little curious to know how much the
Government had done to build up these great
monopolies, and I addressed a letter to the
Commissioner of Public Lauds, and received
tho following answer, which I send to the
Clerk's desk to be read.
The Clerk read as follows :

With great respect, your obedient servant,
JOSEPH S. WILSON,
Commissioner.
Hon. M. S. WlLKlXSOX, House of Representatives.
Mr. OULLOM. I would like to inquire of
the gentleman whether he does not believe
that it is within the power of this Congress
under the Constitution to regulate the tariff of
freights upon railroads running through differ-
ent States, and whether also he does not be-
lieve that it is within the power of the State
governments and the duty of the State gov-
ernments to take hold of these railroad cor-
porations and prevent their extortions upon
the people ?
Mr. WILKINSON. Ill 4nswer id the gen-
tleman I will say that I believe in the doctrine
laid down by Judge Miller in the case of Gray
vs. the Clinton Bridge Company, referred to by
the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. Williams,]
wherein he says:
"For myself I must say that I have no doubt of
the right of Congress, to prescribe all needful and
proper regulations for the conduct of this immense
traffic over any railroad which has voluntarily be-
come part of on© of tho.so lines of interstate com-
munication, or to authorize tho creation of such roads
when the purposes of interstate transportation of
persons and property justify or require it."
That is the decision of Judge Miller of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and as the
Committee on Railways and Canals argue iu
the report to which I have referred, I believe
that Congress has full power of control over
these great through lines of transportation.
Mr. FITCH. Allow me one question. Do
I understand tho gentleman to hold that in u
case where Congress has not chartered tho
road, where it has not given it any grant of
laud or money, where the road has a State
charter, Congress has a right to regulate the
tariff of rates and freights on that road?
Mr. WILKINSON. I do, sir, to this extent.
This is my position: where a road is a link in
a great chain of interstate communication,
although it may bo chartered by the State of
New York, while another portion of the line is
chartered by the State of Illinois, and another
by Ohio, and another by California, still where
they become practically one great connecting
lino between the oceans or between different
States of the Union, I hold with Judge Miller
that Congress can exercise proper control over
all of them.
Mr. FITCH. I agree with the gentleman
that Congress would have power to charter
another railroad to run through those States,
but I ask him to state the section of the Con-
stitution from which he derives the power of
Congress to regulate the rates of fare and
freights upon railroads already constructed.
Mr. WILKINSON. I answer the gentleman
that when these roads put themselves volun-
tarily iu connection with a great line of rail-
roads, such as I have already indicated, they
then become subject to the legislation of Con-
gress under the power given to Congress by
the Constitution to regulate commerce between
the several States. An evasion of the law is a
violation of the law. Therefore, unless tho
power which I claim can be exercised under
the Constitution, States or corporations, by
agreement or collusion, can control transport-
ation or tariffs from one extreme of the Union
to the other by a connection of lines under the
authority of State charters.
These roads cannot by their great combin-
ations and because of their great monopolies
shield themselves against the protecting legis-
lation which is just and constitutional and
which Congress ought to give the people. I
do not think that this argument would apply
to a road entirely within a State and which haa
no connection with roads leading each way
from the borders of the State by which it is
chartered.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Will the gentleman allow
me to make an inquiry of him ?
Mr. WILKINSON. Yes, sir.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I would like to hear from
the gentleman from Minnesota upon the very
point which he has now presented to the House.
As I understand him, he claims that wherever
railroads through several States chartered by
those States are connected together they are
by that connection necessarily placed iu a
position subject to the control of the Federal
Government. Now, will the gentleman please
to state to the House upon what he bases his
argument? Suppose, for instance, that a rail-
road is chartered through the State of New
York, from the city of New York to the city
of Buffalo, and suppose that another railroad
is chartered from Buffalo to the city of Chicago,
and that the two roads run in connection with
each Other ; does the fact that they carry pas-
