Numbers 23. Vicksburg, January 8, 1863.

The lieutenant-general commanding his department desires to express to the troops of his command his high appreciation of their gallant defense of this important position. All praise is due them, not alone for so bravely repulsing the renewed assaults of an enemy vastly superior in numbers, but equally for the cheerful and patient endurance with which they have submitted to the hardships and exposure incident to ten successive day and night of watchfulness in the trenches, rendered imperatively necessary by the close proximity of the opposing armies.

While all have performed their duties with benefit to their country and honor to themselves, still, as must ever be the case in war, fortune has bestowed her opportunities unequally. To those who by her favor held the post of honor, and by their resolute courage availed of their opportunities, special thanks are due; and it will be the pride and agreeable duty of the lieutenant-general commanding to claim for them from their country the distinction and honor they have so justly deserved.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
