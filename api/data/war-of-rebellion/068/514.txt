Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

I have the honor to forward the following dispatch just received from General Custer's headquarters, from one of General Torbert's aides:
HEADQUARTERS,

Junction Furnace and Brock Roads, May 7, 1864-12 m.

GENERAL: General Custer has had a sharp fight on the left, toward Todd's Tavern, and drove the enemy handsomely. The general's position is close to this a little in advance of that of yesterday at same hour. Heaton's battery in same place. General Custer is anxious to know where General Gregg is. The firing has almost ceased for the present. All has gone well. The cavalry he engaged was Fitzhugh Lee's. There was a portion of a Southern (rebel) battery (probably two guns) in position at this side of Todd's Tavern. Communication is reported open with the infantry left.

JOHN J. COPPINGER,

Captain, Fourteenth Infantry, Aide-de-Camp.

The Sixth U. S. Cavalry, sent to United States Ford and roads leading to our left and toward Fredericksburg from Ely's Ford road, just returned. Found no enemy. General Gregg is now moving on Todd's Tavern, also Merritt, and will pitch into the enemy's cavalry at that place. Wilson will cover the train in front.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
