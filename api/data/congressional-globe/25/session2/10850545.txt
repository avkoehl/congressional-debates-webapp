hj of land actually sold oriotamed by thepurchaseisunderthe
ciedit system is 13 643,643 43 acres, and the net amount paid
is $27,905 099 76, wftic! amounts are put down in table A, as
the " quantity of laud sold," and the ' amount paid by pur-
chasers," from the earliest period to the 30th June, 1820
The lands sold from 1787 to J790 inclusive, are the lands seld,
pnor to the opemngof the land sílice, to John Cleves Symmes,
the Ohio Company, and to individuals, at public sales held in
New Yoik and Pittsburgh
These facts rebuke into silence every idea that the policy of
the Government is llhbeial, or that the price of the public land
is too high; jt cannot be, when the demand for land in. the West
is so vapidly augmenting
What are the facts in relation to the settlement of those lands 1
Forty seven years ago the entire population west of the Alle-
ghany mountains hardly amounted to 100,000 souls That
region of country is now the home of nearly 4,000,000 people,
whilst the old States have increased within lhat period at a rate
of about 15 per cent every ten years, the new States have
augmented in population at the rate of 33 per cent in the same
X enod The new States have increased with more than double
the rapidity of the old States, and some of them at more than
quadruple the rate of many of the old States

Has it been the mere íesult of accident that the old States,
with their supenoi situations foi agriculture, eommeiee, and
manufactures, which, moie than anything else, will throw a
dense population mthe cities contiguous to 01 connected with,
the ocean, shouid be so fai outstripped in thru advance to
wealth and population by the new States'1 Oi has it riot haen
an effect growing out of and consequen upon the policy of the
Government, in disposing of, at ^o low a price, the public
lands of the United States, and theiebv wv iting, by the strongest
inducement--, the population of the old States to emigiate fiqm
them and to settle on the cheap and ferule lands m the valley
of the Mississippi1
Tno ravages of the i evolutional y stiuggle impaned the agn
cultural interest of the old State*, and the consequences gio Wing
out of it exhausted the fertility of the soil ma very gi eat degief
To support the irmiesof the revolution and to pay the heavy
quotas and taxes vhtrhwei'e levied upon them, compelled the
farmers, those few "* uo weie not under arms to adopt that
mode ol cultivation /hich was, ch ao t and least labonous,
bi t the most ruinous to the soil They were compelled to pitch
ciop after crop, in rapid succession, m tnesame fields, to supply
the urgent wants of the army, and to enable them to pay the
enouj ous taxes asbe^ed upon them The consequence was
that all the fiesh lands became impoverished, the virgin soi'
exhausted, and 'he land almost ^ori'iless foi culture
lhe farmeis had no time to íest hen lands from repeated ev
hauation, or to supply, by exttaneons means of compost a id
the minerals, the vegetable crops which they annually took
from them Peace which brought independence to om nation,
diid tepose to our airay, biought neither repose nor re^t to the
fields of the faimei A national dtbt of borne two huiidied
millions, and State i'ebts of most onerous amounts, were to he
paid, and paid & * fly bv the acricultural mdustiy of the eoun
tiy This compelled the farmers to peisistm that ruinous mode
of cultivation, which, to supply piessmg and urgent demands,
was impoverishing the Whole face of the toimtiy Then were
opened to maiket, by the Geneial Government, thenchand e\
tensive lands ol the Mississippi valley and at the low ppce of
two dolíais peí acte its consequences were felt by all the old
States, and moie especially by Maryland and tho^e State* w! ose
situations were marked wuh the like peculiaiuies Maryland
hadfumshid hei most abundant share m men ard monev to
defend the V\ ostein lands, a* wed as the eeneial liberty of the
colonies The treaty of peace had surrendered those lands to
top tinned fctat^ v* a common pioptity, yetCnngiess ac-
cepted the acts of cession of \ irgmia and Georgia, paid the
tioops of the former as a condition of cession, and paid the lat
ter several millions of money Thus hate many of the old
States first fought foi thobe lands, and then purchased thtm of
the States and of foreign Governments, jet borae of the old
States have not only to pay all the ^ a e dob's incurred out of
their own Sta'e coffers, but to pay the troops that defetidpd these
ver> western lands* Maryland is called m eveiv year to pay
revolutionary claims, and all thi5  comes chiefly fVom the *)gi1
culuu al imereit of the State, the '•ons^iuence of which ib,+liat
the landi of that State aie taxed moat heavily, indeed, the ¡and
taxes m Mar)land are-higher than m any state luthslmon
Tíiím, what i ■'compense do triage diA oted States receive for pay-
ing those \a*rt amounts m bavma their «oil impoverished and
their \tam highly taxed % Does the Government acta  policy
which will improve the value of lands in the old States, xr\
which which wilí jtfsUf/ the farmer m incurriag the onerout,
expense of ermching Ms greatly exhausted lands % No, feirj
such has not been the pobey pS the Government It has bee 
the policy of the General GoVéíftHient to offer inducements (*•
the people of the" old States to ahatiáem their fanüsand iu then

and money of the o*d States, and that he can now reap m bese-
fit, whilst they have paid the cost U has been to tell Qie£Wa5)ger
that he will give you benefits which shall not be enjoyed by
any patriotic eittüen of the old States, unless he Ieav«=the home
of his childhood and Che State of his nativity.
The citens of the oh$ States have found it to theiradramv
age to dispose or their lands at any pnce, rather than rasurite
labor and expense ofennchmg them, when, with an amooaS-
sufficient to enrich ten acres of }ami long in cul'ivation, they
could purchase perhaps fifty acres of the richlandsm the West,
and lands exempt from the burden of taxation for five years.
Yes, one in teasing tide of emigration is setting to the West,
leaving the oíd States, where taxes are higíí, and soil leas pro
ductive and less cheap, going to the West, where land is neb,
taxes low, indthemunificenceof the General Government car-
rying education to every village and to every cottage    The sa-
gacit*   f self interest has induced the rich and the po-o*, the m-
dusti    is and enterprising, to migrate to that country^ where
home*- can be procured for a consideration so small that it re-
quit- «t little more than the will to possess them, to be ov^ti
and uicupied, and but moderate industry to make tbemyiOia
rros abundantly    The reduced pnce of the fertile landflof th^
Wet has had a tendency of reducing the pnce of landed estates
in the old States    Many portions of Virginia and Maryland are
n t as populous now as they were thirty years ago.   Yes, sir,
tlie picture drawn m the late Virginia convention, by a dietm-
K mshed member of this House, (Mr Mercer,) was not a mere
iaucy sketch of the present impoverished ana desolated condi-
tion of the lower counties of hip native State, when compared
with their former wealth and population    Those fieíds, where
once waved the golden harvest, aie now a barren waste j thow
mansions, which were onee the abode of chivalry, refinement,
and generous hospitality, are now " as desolate as the dwelling
of Moina ?' and the wild beasts have returned from the moun-
tains to find a shelter amid the thickets of their ancient hiding*'
places    Should any member on this floor doubt these thipgs,
one hour's rule from this city, into either Maryland or Virginia,
will grve him proofs of the melanrholy reality    Yes, sir; you
may look fiom the balustrades of this edifice, 01 ascend ite lofty
dome, anil, ranging your view mto tiie Maryland or Virginia
-ide of the Potomac, see lands thus contiguous to the capital of
the uiition which can be bought for three or four dollars per acre;
some have been «old within the lost year for less than three dol-
íais per acie  The spatse inhabitants, though patient andlabon-
oub, find that, even with the most ngitl economy and frugality,
wealth does not augment, and that their most untiring industry
must be applied,
" To toice a reluctant soil to yield
Them biead'

hausted, fiomtl e caiioes which 1 have aheady «¡"igned     lo>

but few .tie able) as long as they can puichate, at the low rate
of $1 25 per acte, rich and fresh lands on the navigable riven*
of the West, which wiil yield more abundantly
I will invite the attention of the committee to a passage &f the
lepoit, which, I think, and Í beheve-it can be shown, assumes a.
false position
( The Government oí the United States, 'says the report, * is
probably the only vendor, either of land or any other property,
that holds the most inferior quality oí any article at the sanie
pi tee with the best If an individual were to maintain that all
domestic anmials of a given species were ol the same value*
how inconsistent would he appear' If amerchant were to re-
fuse to sell keisey at any lowei pnce than he could obtain the
superfine hi oadcloth, his conduct would ceiiamly be deemed
utterly abmrd ^ettheie is not greatu absurdity m either of
the^e proposi ions than there ism maintaining that laitdqf every
quality is worth oi should command, the same pnce!
" B it gne me a foothoir1, ' eaid one ot old, 'and I will move
thewoild ' Gram the gent.Piiiai i premises, and I will admit
that there is some olausib y in hfc> conclusion, but I utterly
denv that it is a lact lhat the "Government holds the most
ir íioi quality of the public lands at the same price with
the bes' "
This leads to a more paiticular inquiry n To the mode adopted
by Congiess foi the sale of he public lands Piiorto 3&2G, those
landb which wer not sold at auction at above $2 per acit eomd
b tntered by purchasers for that sum, to be paid in four equal
an nial payments the first withm forty days, and the three other
paymems wi hm two, three and four > .ira aitei date of pur
chase "No mteieu was to be charged if punctually paid, and
a discount ot eight per cent was made by the Government if
th° purch^er paid cafh , ¡=o that, by prompt payment, the price
would be i educed to & 1 64 peí acre, and the purchaser was al
loffedto purchase any amount abo\e a quarter oi a section of
one hundied and sixty acres 11 e piebent law peí mus gale r>f
an eighth of asection and establishes a minimum price afSl&j,
which is required tobe paidiu hand But before any lañáis
hab'e tc pi i vate en^ry at the puce of SI 25 pet acre itraubt
have beenfim offered at public sale
The lands pre now first Oilered at public vend'i1 exposed to
farcompei.it on, and no tun f equently instead ol p' ~5 í er acie,
they bung i\e an-1 ten times that amount By the iecentgalcs
of the lands on Red river, within the last three years, they have
sold as high as fiom twelve to thirteen dollars per acre, and
yet we are, with these undeniable lacts before us, told that the
Government a3ks as much for her werst lands as she dots foi
her best
By the report sf the Commissioner ot the Geuerak Land Of-
fice, whish is appended to the lepoit oi the Committee on the
Pdhl t I anda of the twenty third Cong) ess, it will appear that,
m three years, beginning with 1826, there were sold 413,607
acres of public land in Alabama, for #876,087f making the Urn*,
«oí 1 average $1 39 iperacrt which is considei ably more thaa
the Governm* nt rate, as fixed at tkanaunimum price, and yet,
wuh that evidence appended to the report, the com rmttee grave*.
ly asserts 'hat the Govexninent holds all of its lands at thecame
price Tns> honorable chagfrmar sf the committee comp&hie
that the price of the pubifc lands is ton high, and, as prool, he
exhibits the fact ttuHsáíh? hundred millions of *wi«s have beer*
