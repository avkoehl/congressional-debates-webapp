ing re-enforcements from the Tennessee here to night with the view of turning our position and intercepting our boats at Randolph Forge, six miles above us, which is practicable with artillery, then the road to Nashville would lay open to them.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH ALABAMA,Tuscumbia, Ala., February 14, 1862.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Since my letter of the 6th instant I have been ordered by General Bragg to take charge of the defenses of North Alabama and the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.* I have established my headquarters for the present at this place, but with the district as now organized it is impossible to adopt any system of defenses at all commensurate with the magnitude of the interests involved. The Memphis and Charleston Railroad is the very backbone of the Confederacy, and its possession by us is in imminent danger. With this district as now limited to North Alabama I have no control of that portion of Mississippi through which the road runs, nor of that portion of Tennessee lying on the Tennessee River, and from which not only this road but also the Mobile and Ohio Railroad may be approached. I theretore respectfully and urgently suggest that this district be so enlarged as to embrace not only North Alabama, but the counties of Tishomingo and Tippah in Mississippi and the counties of Wayne, Hardin, and McNairy in Tennessee. These counties of Mississippi and Tennessee are enbraced in the department of General Johnston, and I shall write to him to-day embodying these suggestions. But the urgency of the case does not brook delay, and I have felt it to be my duty to approach you directly on the subject. The truth is, our generals of departments have such extended fields of operation that it is impossible for them to give the necessary attention to distant points of whatsoever strategic importance. The only troops assigned to me by General Bragg are one regiment of infantry and one regiment of cavalry. The inadequacy of this force is patent to observation, and its remedy lies sith yourself. In the counties of Wayne and Hardin, in Tennessee, a large proportion of the population is in sympathy with the enemy, and either SAvannah, in Tennessee, or Eastport, in Mississippi, will be made the base of his operations.

In the hope that you will give these suggestion immediate consideration, I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. P. WALKER.

FORT DONELSON, February 14, 1862.

General JOHNSTON:

The enemy have reached the ground near the fort with eight or ten gun-boats, I am uncertain which, and fifteen transport reported to have on board near 20,000 men. They are now landing. This makes their force nearly 40,000 strong. I will fight them this evening.

John B. FLOYD,

Brigadier-General.
