COLUMBIA, S. C., December --, 1864.

Honorable james A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The undersigned citizens of South Carolina respectfully request that at least one corps of the army be sent from Virginia to save the States of Georgia and South Carolina from being laid waste by the enemy. There is no force here to prevent it, and it is absolutely necessary to have at least one well-organized corps besides Hardee's on the coast, about which the half-trained citizens may rally. Otherwise, however brave and determined, their efforts will amount to nothing. These two States have, to a large extent, furnished the Army of Virginia with supplies. If they are wasted by raids and their railroads cut, this source of supply is lost. we are sensible of the pressure upon Richmond, and the importance of saving the capital, but it is manifest that its defense must at this moment be made here.

A just regard for the safety of these States and of the common cause in which we are all embarked induces us to press this appeal with great earnestness upon your consideration.

We have the honor to be, with high respect, your obedient servants,

W. F. De Saussure, Andr. Crawford, W. H. Scarborough,
