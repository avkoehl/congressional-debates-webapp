HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, Jan 8, 1838
The following message, in writing, was received
horn  the President  of the United States, by the
hands of his private secretary, Abraham Van Bu-
r , Esq
To ihe Senate and
House of Representatives, United Slates
In the highly excited state of feeling on the
noi them frontier, occasioned by the disturbances
in Canada, it was to be apprehended that causes of
< omplamt might arise on the line dividing the Uni-
ted States from her Brilanuic Majesty's dominions
Every precaution was therefore taken on our part
authorized by the existing lavt5,jind as the Hoops
ol the piovmces w<?re embodied on the Canadian
oide, it was hoped that no serious -violation of the
lights of the United States would be permitted to
occur I regret, however, to inform you that an
ontiageof a most aggiavated character has been
•committed, accompanied by a hostile though tem-
porary invasion of   our territory, producing the
0 rongest feelings of resentment on the part of our
citizens in the neighboihood, and in the whole
border line, and that the excitement previously
existing haa been alarmingly increased To guard
against the po sible recurrence of any similai act,
1  have thought it indispensable to call out a por-
tion of the militia to be posted on that fiontier
The documents herewith presented to Congress,
ohow the character of the outrage committed, the
measures taken in consequence of its occuncnce,
and the necessity for resorting to them
It will also be seen that the subject was immedi-
ately brought to the notice of the British minister
accredited to this country, ana the propel steps
taken on oui part to obtain the fullest information
of alt the circumstances leading to and attendant
upon the transat tion, preparatory to a demand for
reparation I ask such appropriations as the cir-
cumstances in which our country is thus unexpect-
edly placed require

Sir Enclosed aic cepie^oi affidavits *vluch I
have pi«paied in great ha-ste, and which contain all
that is material m lelation to the gross and extia-
ordmary transaction to which they relate Out
whole frontier is n corr motion, and I fear it will
be difficult to restrain our citizens from revenging,
by a resort to aims, this flagtant invasion of oui
territory Evciy thing that can be done will be by
the public authorities to pievent ^o injudicious a
movement The lespectivc sheriffs oi Eric and
Niagara have taken the responsibility oi calling ou i
the militia, to guard the fiontier, and pievent any
furthei depredations
I am, sir, with great considciation,
Your obedient servant,

President of the United States

Gilman Appleby, of the cily of Buffalo, being
sworn, says, that he left the port of Buffalo on the
morning ot the 29th instant, m the steamboat Ca-o
line, owned by William Wells, of Buffalo, and
bound for Sohlossci, upon the east side of the Nia
gara river, and within the United Slates That
this deponent commanded the said Caroline, and
that she was cleared from Buffalo with a view to
run between «aid Buffalo and Scblosser, cany pas
sengers freight etc That lhis> deponent caiued
the said Caiolme to be landed at Black Ro<l¡, on
hei way down and that, while at Black Rock,
this deponent caused the American flag to be run
up, and that, soon after Ipavmg BlacK Rook liai
boi,a\olley ol musketry was discharged al the
Caroline irom the Canada shore, but \vithout m-
jjiy That the said Caroline continued her
couise down Ihe Niagara river unmolested, and
landed outside of certain scows or boats attached
to Navy Island, where a number of jiassen-
gers disembarked, and, as this deponent sup-
poses, ccitun articles of lrc ght were lindel
That from this point thr Caroline ran to Schlos
"er, arriving there at three o'clock in the aitcrn on,
that, between this time and dark, the Carolms
made two trips to Navy Island, landing as belorc
That, at about six o clork in the evening, this 1c
pouent cau ed the >aid Caiolme to be landed al
Schlosser, and made last with ehains to the dock at
that p'ao That the crew an 1 ofliceis ot the Cai o-
line numbered ten, and that, in Ihe course oí the
evening, twenty-three individual , all of whom
were citizens of the United Slat s, came on boaid
of the Caroline, and requested this deponent and
other officers oí the boat to permit them to remain
on board during the nigh', as they were unable to get
lodgings at the tavern neai by, the e requests w°te
acceded to, and the peisons thus coming on board
retired to rest, a* did also all oí the crew andoth
cersof ihe Caiolme, except such as were stationed to
watch during the night That about midnight, this
deponent was mfouned by one ol the watch that
several bo its filled with men were making towaids
the Caroline from the river, and this deponent iro-
medialely gave the alarm, and before he was able
to reach the dock the Caroline was boarded by some
seventy oi e ghty men, all of whom were aimed
That they immediately commenced a warfare with
muskets, swords, and cutlasses, upon the deft ice-
less crew and passengers oí the Caiolme under a
fierce cry of "G—d damn them, give them no quai-
ter->, kill every man, fire' fire "' That the Cnro
line was abandoned without resistance, and the
only effort made bj either the crew or pas engeis
seemed to be to escape slaughter That this depo
nent narrowly escaped , having received several
wounds, none of which, however, are of a serious
character That immediately after the Caroline
fell into the hands of the armsd force who boarded
her, she was set on file, cut loose from the dock,
was tow ed into the current of the nv ei, there a ban
doned, and soon after descended the Niagara B'alls,
that this deponent has made vigilant search after the
individuals, thirty three m number, who are known
to have been on the Caroline at the time she was
boartled, and twenty-one only are to be found, one
of whom, to wit, Amos Durfee, of Buffalo, was
found dead upon the dock, having received a shot
from a musket, the ball of which penetrated the
back part of the head, and came out at the forehead
Jame3 H Kmg and Captain C F Harding were
seriously, though not mortally wounded Several
others leceived slight wounds The tw elve indivi-
duals who are missing, this deponent has no doubt
w ere either murdered upon the steamboat, or found
a wat ry grave in the cataract of the falls And
this deponent iurther says, that immediately after
the Caroline was got into the current of the stream
and abandoned, as before stated, beacon lights were
discovered upon the Canada shore, near Chippewa,
and after sufficient time had elapsed to enable the
boits to reach that shore, this deponent distinctly
heard loud and vociferous cheering at that point.
That this deponent has no doubt that the individuals
who boarded the Caroline were a part of the British
forces now stationsd at Chippewa

Sir You will repair, without dela}, to the
Cm id i frontín of the United State-, and assume
tne militaiy command there.
Heiewith you will receive duplicate letters to
the Governors of the States of New Yoik and
Vertnont, lequestmg them to call into Ihe service
of the United Stales such a militia forci as y u
may kern necessiry foi the defence of that iron-
tier of Ihe Unite 1 States
Tins powei has ben confided to you in the full
peisinsion that y<u will use it discreetly, and ex-
tend dip call only so far as circum anees may
seem to requue
It is important that tne troops called into the
service should be, if possible, exempt from that
stute of e-icitement which Ihe late violation of our
territory has created, and 5 ou w ill thereibie impress
upon the Governors of these border States the pro-
pnetv of selecting troops from a portion of the
State distant from the theatre of action
The Executive possesses no le£a' authonty to
e nploy the military force to restrain persons with-
in our jurisdiction, and who ought to be under our
control, from violating the laws, by making incur-
sions into the territory of neighboung and friendly
nations, wito hostile intent    I can give you, there-
