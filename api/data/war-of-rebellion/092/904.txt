SAVANNAH, November 28, 1864.

Major General S. JONES:

Wheeler telegraphs from Waynesborough, at 8. 30 p. m. yesterday, that Kilpatrick was there with large cavalry force and had started down on Millen road. General Bragg telegraphs to-day that the enemy had not crossed the Savannah, as reported.

D. H. POOLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUSTA, GA., November 28, 1864.

General SAM. JONES:

The report is unfounded; the different ferries are guarded, and all boats are ordered to be destroyed. The enemy's cavalry and our own are near Waynesborough, where fighting has been going on this morning. We are not as well informed about his infantry, but believe it to be between the Ogeechee bridge and Millen.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

It is reported, via Savannah, the enemy with infantry and artillery entered Millen yesterday. Wheeler is rapidly pursuing Kilpatrick, who retreats in that direction from Waynesborough.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

AUGUSTA, November 29, 1864-6. 30 p. m.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond:

General Jones telegraphs from Charleston:

Ten gun-boats with transports landing troops at Boykins, on Broad River. Four gun-boats with transports and barges are by this time at Mackay's Point, junction of Pocotaligo with Broad River. I am sending all assistance from here, and think we must make the struggle near the coast.

As the movement relieves Wilmington might not same of the North Carolina reserves be sent to General Jones?

BRAXTON BRAGG.
