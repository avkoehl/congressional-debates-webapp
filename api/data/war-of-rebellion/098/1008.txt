GENERAL: An inspection of the rebel defenses of Charleston shows that we have taken over 450 pieces of ordnance, being more than double what I first reported. The lot includes 8 and 10-inch columbiads, a great many 32 and 42 pounder rifles, some 7-inch Brooke rifles, and many pieces of foreign make. We also captured eight locomotives and a number of platform and passenger cars, all in good condition. Deserters report that the last of Hardee's army was to have crossed the Santee River yesterday, bound for Charlotte, M. C., and that it was fared that General Sherman had already intercepted their march. It is reported on similar authority that the last of Hood's Army, 12. 000 strong, passed through Augusta last Sunday, the 19th, on its way to Beauregard. I have a force forty miles out on the Northeastern Railroad, toward the Santee River.

Georgetown has been evacuated by the enemy, and is now in our possession. Deserters are coming in constantly; we have over 400 already.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: I have to correct one statement in my telegraphic dispatch from Charleston of February 18, that the arsenal was burned on that day. That building was not among those destroyed by fire. The force sent out on the Northeastern Railroad reached Santee River, skirmishing with Hardee's rear guard. The railroad bridge over the Santee was burned by the enemy. The railroad bridge over the Santee was burned by the enemy. The time having expired when this advance could be of any assistance to General Sherman,, judging from the reports of his present position, and it being necessary to recall this force in order to replace the troops drawn from General Grover's command for Cape Fear River, orders have been given for it to return to Charleston, My present intention is to hold Georgetown permanently. Admiral Dahlgren's flag ship, the Harvest Moon, was sunk
