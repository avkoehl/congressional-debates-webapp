arc all that will be oll'-rod, and then lotus to-mor-
row, at oite o'clock, take a vote on the final pas-
sage of the bill.
Mr. MASON. I can come to no understand-
ing about taking the vote on the passage of the
bill, because I really do not know what the bill
is. Whenever the fViond^ of the hill shall have
placed it in such a form as they think proper, and
submit it to the vote of the .Senate, I shall ask that
the bill be printed, so that we may see what it is.
Mr. GWIN. It is printed precisely as it has
stood for several days.
Mr. MASON. If it is in such a form that we
can see it, very well; but I protest against taking
the vote until I can see what it is.
Mr. GWIN. I merely make the suggestion
that we take the vote on the substitutes.
Mr. BELL. "Will the Senator allow me to
have a vote on my proposition?
Mr. GWIN. The proposition of the Senator
from Wisconsin is now before the Senate.
Mr. BELL. "Will he not waive it ?
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I desire to have a vote on
my proposition. If that be voted down, it will
not affect at all the proposition which is offered
by the honorable Senator from Tennessee.
'Mr. BELL. Do you wish a vote on yours
now ?
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Yes.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. BELL. I now move to recommit the bill
to the committee, with instructions to report forth-
with the substitute which I have presented.
The substitute of Sir. Bell is as follows:
