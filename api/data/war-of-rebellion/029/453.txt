in the camp. I thank him and the brave men he commands for the fearless discharge of their duties amid so many hardships and perils.

Before concluding this report, it will be proper to add that when I speak of a quiet day, I mean to speak comparatively. We had no quiet days; no rest from the time we reached the battle-field until the enemy fled; skirmishing constantly, and sometimes terrible cannonading.

On the 2nd, which we call a quiet day until about 4 p.m., the First Division, under Hascall, laid for a half hour in the early part of the day under the heaviest cannonading we endured. Many men were killed, but he and his brave soldiers would not flinch.

The appended summary of the killed and wounded, furnished by my medical director, demonstrates with what fearful energy and earnestness the battle was contested in my command.
