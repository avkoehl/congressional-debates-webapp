companies as mustered into service, as well as for the necessary supplies of clothing, tents, camp equiPAGE, and subsistence. I have deemed it not improper to direct your particular attention to these points, from the fact that many of our companies already in camp and mustered into service have not yet received their county money, and in many instances are unprovided with tents, axes, camp-kettles, and blankets-some of them almost without clothing. I need not say that the effect has been not only to delay the completion of the requisition, but greatly to depress the spirit of volunteering with our people. The Confederate quartermaster at this point has exerted himself to the utmost to supply these deficiencies, but is unable to procure the materials for tens, &amp;c., in sufficient quantities to supply the demand for the different camps. At Tuscaloosa the material for tents can speedily be manufactured, subsistence purchased at reasonable rates, and probably a sufficient supply of camp equiPAGEobtained. If Captain Griswold, the acting quartermaster in command of the post at Tuscaloosa, is at once authorized to contract for tens, subsist the troops, and pay the bounty money, it will tend much to advance the public interests and facilitate matters at that point. I would also suggest that as the facilities for the communication of Tuscaloosa with Mobile are greater than with this place, that the funds for the purposes referred to be procured from the Government depository at that point, rather than from the quartermaster's department here.

I have the honor to be, &c., very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. GILL SHORTER.
