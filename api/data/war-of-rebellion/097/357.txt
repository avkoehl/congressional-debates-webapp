HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,Mrs. Rainey's, March 31, 1865-8.50 a.m.

Brevet Major-General MOTT,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding desires that you capture, if possible, some of the pickets in our front, and ascertain to what force they belong, after which he desires that they be sent to these headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. MILLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

He also desires me to state that General De Trobriand's brigade will be used as a reserve for yourself or for General Hays if he should call for re-enforcements.

C. J. MILLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865.

General MOTT:

From all I can learn from deserters the main line of the enemy is on the other side of Hatcher's Run between Crow house and Boydton, and that they have small force this side of the run between those points. Don't you think that this part of the line can be held by one brigade of yours and Hays' divisions, so that you can draw out a brigade and bring down here where the attack is being made. Send answer.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-12.30 p.m.

General MOTT:

General Humphreys directs that if you don't find the enemy in force and it is practicable you withdraw one of your brigades from the line and hold it in reserve in rear of your line ready to move it where it may be needed.

C. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
