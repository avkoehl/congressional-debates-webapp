S.SIIJ3LLATURGFR,
a. w. scoriELD,
Managers on the part oj the Howe.
GKORGE F. EDMUNDS,
JOHN SHERMAN.
Managers on the pan of the Senate.
Mr. SCOFIELD. I request that the Speaker
will order the roll lo be called in order to ascer-
tain whether there is a quorum present. Prob-
ably while the roll is being called a quorum
will come in. This is a very important bill,
and X think we should not commence action
on it with so small a number of members
present.
Mr. WOOD. I suppose the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Shel-labakgeii] intends to present
the views of the majority of the conference
committee, and while he is doing so it is prob-
able that a quorum will arrive. |j
Mr. SCOFIELD. But the very reason why
I make the request is that I want gentlemen
to hear his explanation of what the committee
of conference have done. It is of no use for
the gentleman from Ohio to make his explan-
ation and then have gentlemen come in after-
ward to act upon the report, without having
heard the reasons for it.
Mr. RANDALL. Properly we have no right
lo proceed with business, for it is very mani-
fest that there is not a quorum present.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would not
allow any contested business whatever to be
done without the presence of a quorum.
Mr. SCOFIELD. If the Chair will cause
the roll to be called, the House by the time
that is done will probably be full.
The SPEAKER. The only objection to that
is that it puts down gentlemen as absentees who
are not really absent. The roll-call is a matter
of record.
Mr. SCOFIELD. Then I will move that
there be a call of the House.
Mr. WOOD. That is quite unnecessary until
it is ascertained in an official manner that there
is no quorum present.
Mr. SCOFIELD. Very well; then I will
withdraw the motion and yield to the gentle-
man from Wisconsin, [Mr. Hazleton,] who
has a request to make to the House.
equalization of bounties.
Mr. HAZLETON, of Wisconsin, by unani-
mous consent, submitted the following resolu-
tion ; which was read, considered, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Committee on Military Affaira
when appointed bo instructed to consider and report
what additional legislation is necessary to equalise
soldiers' bounty, and also to investigate and report
tho additional expense per annum to the Govern-
ment by adding twenty-live per cent, to the pen-
sions of such persons now 011 the pension-roils "Who
are totally disabled. â€¢
Mr. SCOFIELD moved to reconsider the
vote by which the resolution was adopted; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
report of smithsonian institution.
Mr. ELLIS H. ROBERTS, from the Com-
mittee on Printing, reported the following res-
olution :
It evolved by t7ie House of 12e2)re8entativeD, (the Sen-
ate concurring,) That twelve thousand five hundred
additional copics of the report of tho Smithsonian
Institution for the year 1870 be printed; twenty-five
hundred for tho use of tho Senate, five thousand
tor the use of the House, and live thousand lor tho
use of the Institution: J-'iovided, That the aggregate
number of pages of said report shali not exceed four
hundred and fifty, and that thero shall be no illus-
trations except those furnished, by tho Smithsonian
Institution.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Is that the usual
apportionment between the House and the
Senate ?
Mr. ELLIS H. ROBERTS. The number for
tho House is one thousand larger than it was
last year, and for the Senate the same.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. There are not one
third as many Senators as there are members
of the House.
Mr. POLAND. We always give them more.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. There is no reason
for that.
Mr. ELLIS H. ROBERTS. I movethe pre-
vious question on agreeing to the resolution.
The previous question was seconded and tho
main question ordered; and under the oper-
ation thereof the resolution was agreed to.
Mr. ELLIS H. ROBERTS moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the resolution was
adopted ; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter morion was agreed to.
TOLEDO A PORT OF ENTRY.
Mr. PECK, by unanimous consent, presented
resolutions of the Board of Trade of Toledo,
Ohio, asking that Toledo be made a port of

on Commerce when appointed.
