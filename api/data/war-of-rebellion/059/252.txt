Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

General Dodge's scouts report a movement of rebel cavalry along our front, number not stated; say they are going to join Forrest, and formerly belonged to Wheeler's command. They passed through Tuscaloosa, and General Dodge thinks came out of Coosa Valley.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, April 4, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I am concentrating a force at Lexington and have cavalry beyond. I desire to co-operate with General Sturgis in reconnaissance toward Pound Gap. Our forces now occupy West Liberty, Louisa, Big Hill, and Irvine. I will go up to Mount Sterling on Wednesday. The Seventeenth Indiana is here, mounted. Shall I send it to Nashville by land, and all other mounted regiments?

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 4, 1864.

General WILSON,

Chief of Cavalry, Washington, D. C.:

Yours of March 31 is received. We have, as you know, a vast amount of dismounted cavalry. I shall employ a part of it in guarding railroads. As a rule, the newly purchased cavalry horses should go to veterans, with a clear understanding if they fail to take proper care of them they will not again have a remount.

Could not the State troops and militia supply their own horses, receiving the per diem allowed by law?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 4, 1864.

General BRAYMAN,

Cairo:

General Corse is on his way to Paducah and Cairo in a boat. Will see you and explain all matters. Keep me advised of actual facts, and cause any detachments of Forrest in reach to be punished. Hurlbut reports Forrest down about Jackson, Tenn.

I want communication kept up with Veatch and his force to be strengthened by any regiments arriving for McPherson.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
