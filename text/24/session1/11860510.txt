bills; but I would not vote for either to the neg-
lect of the other. Nor would I vote for either
because I can see much to encourage the hope of
public benefitcorresponding with the large amount
of expenditure which they involve unless there
will grow up at no distant day some new system
of execution and economy on the part of the
Government in relation to works of this class.
I would greatly prefer a repeal, for a season at
least, of the annual appropriation under the law
of 1824, for new surveys, to which I have ad-
verted. It was attempted in the last Congress,
and for a season the attempt was successful.
Many gentlemen now upon this floor will recol-
lect by what means the attempt was finally de-
feated. It is the fountain of madness upon the
subject of these improvements. But I will not
detain the committee at this time to discuss that
proposition, and will only add that I hope the
two bills now before the committee may sink or
Bwim together.
THE HARBOR BILL.
REMARKS OF HON. JOHN P. KING,
OF GEORGIA,
In Senate, July 2,1836.
The new Harbor bill being under considera-
tion—
Mr. KING said, he might be disposed to go '
somewhat at length into the subject of the bill
had not the most important principles connected
with it already been very fully discussed.    Aa
we were pressed for time, his principal object was
to give to the Senate the history of our legisla-
tion upon the subject of harbors more in detail
than had been presented, by which it would be '
seen that gentlemen were greatly mistaken when |
they supposed that this system had agetorecom- ]
mend it.   He was astonished at the mistake of
the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Buchanan]
and the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Web-
stek,] who had stated that we were only pursuing
the policy adopted by the Government from the
date of the Constitution.
Congress had passed an act in 1789 to pay the
expenses of keeping in repair such light-houses,
buoys, beacons, public piers, &c, as the States
might cede to the General Government. Some
cessions were made, and the statute had been
executed ata very trifling expense, for the system
of jobbing had not been encouraged by the State
governments, which had only constructed such
works as were of some utility.
But on the passage of this act did we find
States, commercial cities, corporations, villages,
and private speculating companies pouring in
upon Congress to improve their harbors, and
make new ones, at the common expense of the
nation? Not so. They never dreamed of such
a thing. Such works had been constructed at
the expense of those who were benefited by
them, and it never occurred to anybody that
such work should be constructed at the national
cost. Until recently, a system had been intro-
duced resulting in benefits entirely local, building
up cities, and enriching individuals at the cost
of the Government. He had drawn off a state-
ment which would show how far Senators were
in error when they supposed the system had
commenced with the Government. The first
appropriation he had been able to find for such
objects as those contained in the bill was in 1816.
Mr. K. then read to the Senate the following
statement of appropriations made for harbors by
the General Government:
appropriations for Survey , Harbors, and River .
1816............................................ «30,000
1817............................................       -
1818............................................
1819.............................................
1820.............................................
1821............................................     2,600
1822............................................     11,500
1823............................................      6,500
1824............................................    40,000
1825............................................    57,085
1826............................................  133,505
1827............................................    41,850
$322,000
Here was a little upwards of three hundred
thousand dollars appropriated by the Government
between 1789 and 1828, and not one dollar had
been appropriated for these objects for twenty-
seven years after the adoption of the Constitution;
yet some shrewd patriots had all at once dis-
covered that the commerce of the country would
be ruined, unless two or three millions per annum
should be appropriated by the Government for
these local and partial purposes. Mr. K. said
in 1828 the breakwater was commenced, and
$250,000 was appropriated for that purpose, and
something for other objects, as follows:
1828 (ine!uding$250,000for Delaware breakwater) $317,402
1829............................................    10,181
1830............................................
1831............................................  671,000
1832............................................  541,300
1833............................................   457,256
1834-35.........................................   458,056
Thus the history of this harbor-making would
be seen.   It never commenced till 1816, when a
small appropriation of $30,000 was made.   Was
that a precedent so popular as to be immediately
followed up?   No; Congress seemed so alarmed
at that small transgression that nothing more
was appropriated until 1821, when the small sum
of $2,500 only was appropriated, and the appro-
priations continued to be trifling, and principally
for old works, except the Delaware breakwater,
till 1832, a year which would be long remembered
by  the political economists of this country as
one in which a premium was offered to any one
who could suggest the best means of squandering
the public money.    From that time the appro-
priations had averaged about half a million, till
this year.   This year we had sent to us bills
from the House for near three millions, including
light-houses, and upwards of two millions for
harbors alone. The bill for new works then before
the Senate, as sent from the House, was near a
million, and by an estimate made by the intelli-
gent chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means in the House, was the commencement
only of an expenditure of at least ten millions on
the new works proposed.    He thought the ex-
penditure would be much more, and from past
experience in such works, the  proposed new
works would cost thirty millions, for it was a
singular fact, that this local jobbing once com-
menced was almostin terminable; and some works
had cost annually, for many years, as much as
the first estimate, and the estimated cost of com-
pletion more than the original estimate.  It would
always be so when we undertook to war against
nature and make harbors where God never in-
tended them, or appropriate money merely to
give a job by its expenditure.
This vast expenditure was almost entirely con-
fined to one section of the country, and was
drawn from the Treasury by local combinations
for no national purpose. It could not be borne
by the people generally, when understood. If
the proceedings of this session were an earnest
of what we had to expect in future, he looked
upon the subject as one of the most important
that had ever agitated the councils of the coun-
try. There was nothing national in it, and the
tariff was a blessing to the South when compared
with it. The tariff benefited large communities,
and, however onerous, was national and patriotic
in its origin, and the patriotic of every section
of the country were disposed to forbear long with
those who struggled to maintain interests that
had grown up under it. But this was a new sys-
tem of local bounties and private speculation.
Those who had the most modesty got the least
money, and those who had the least conscience
got the most money. The South had constitu-
tional scruples upon the subject, and asked foT
nothing, got nothing, wanted nothing. It was
not only internal improvements, but internal im-
provements in the worst form, and (except for
our naval stations) he would like to know how
those opposed to internal improvements could
vote for cutting out a harbor to aid the ap-
proach of vessels to a village, and could not vote
for a road between one State or one city and
another. They pretended to derive their power
from the power to "regulate commerce with for-
eign nations." "Well, did not the same power,
in the words, extend the regulation of commerce
" among the several States ?" If one was uncon-
stitutional, the other was equally so; and the
advantage was greatly in favor of the road in
every other view, for that would be a useful high-
way for all the world who traveled it, and the
other confined its advantages to enriching a petty
corporation or a few individuals.
But it had been said by the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Davis,] that our revenue was
collected at these ports; and there was an obIio-a-
tion to open them and keep them in repair on that
account. And was our revenue increased by
clearing out and multiplying these harbors? Not
a single dollar. On the contrary, the more the
ports were multiplied, the greater the expenses
of collection; and consequently the revenue was
diminished by the amount of this increase, and
by all we expended on harbors beside. How
would our national commerce suffer by an ob-
struction in the harbor of a particular city ? If
there should be an obstruction in the harbor of
New York, it would only give a neighboring
city some advantage, until New York, whose
interest was affected, removed the obstruction.
But if the Government removes the obstruction,
other cities contribute to these very improve-
ments, which have a direct tendency to injure
them. If the port of Charleston or Philadelphia
(he said) had advantages over New York, that
was a matter of rival interest between those
cities, and had always been so considered, until
this modern invention of taxing the people of
the United States to relieve those who were alone
interested.
The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Web-
ster] had stated that other Governments had
paid for opening and repairing harbors in their
commercial cities. This, he thought, was not
generally true. Some of the despotic sovereigns
of Europe, without any limitation of power or
sense of justice, occasionally took cities under
their royal protection, and disbursed the public
money upon them without regard to any partic-
ular rule. But the rule, he believed, was most
generally to authorize the city to levy a tonnage
on vessels for this purpose—this was the correct
mode. In this way, this gave each city its own
natural advantages, and taxed those who had the
benefit of the improvement.
The Senator from Massachusetts was equally
in error when he stated that the States or cities
had never considered themselves bound to keep
their own ports in repair since the adoption of
the Constitution. This was directly contradicted
by the history of every important seaport in the
Union, and particularly that of Baltimore, which
had just been mentioned by the Senator from
Carolina, [Mr. Preston.] Maryland had granted
an annual appropriation to Baltimore of $30,000,
to keep the harbor of that city in repair. As a
punishment to the city for the late outrages on
private property, permitted and committed by its
citizens, that fund had been taken to indemnify
those who had suffered by those outrages. And
now, for the first timé, Baltimore comes here,
and, by joining in the combination, gets the same
amount from the national Treasury. This was a
fair illustration of the whole system. Maryland
comes into the concern, and the people of the
United States are made to pay for the depreda-
tions of a Baltimore mob.
Again, I have shown that harbors have been
made and improved by those to whom they be-
longed, from 1789 until a few years back, or have
not been made or improved at all. And if they
had needed no improvement for so many years,
he thought it good evidence that this rush for
millions all at once was uncalled for by the public
interest. The truth was, the public had nothing
to do with the matter. This vast combination
that was to plunder the Treasury of so many
millions, was made up of interests purely private
and local. What was constantly the language
used on the floor of both Houses, if any member
expressed a doubt, who had a few thousands
offered to his own State, to bribe him into silence?
Why, it was, " If you don't want it, strike it
out-, and was a great national interest to be con-
trolled by the simple wish of an individual ? But
such language was perfectly natural, considering
the manner how these speculations and jobs were
got up. Who asked for or recommended them ?
Any general interest? No; the applications were
all from cities, from individuals, or from com-
panies who laid out sites for towns, got Congress
