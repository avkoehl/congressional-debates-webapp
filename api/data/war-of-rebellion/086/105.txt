HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, October 19, 1864.

Colonel R. B. JONES,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Lake Pontchartrain:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs that you establish a picket station at the old field-work on Gentilly Bayou (or Bayou Sauve) to consist of one commissioned officer and twenty enlisted men from the company at the railroad crossing. The duties of this picket will embrace all the duties of an outpost in rules and regulations for outpost and picket duty, as well as prevent all smuggling or running any contraband goods, either down that bayou or through there by land. it is calculated that this picket will effectually prevent any smuggling trade carried on through any of the bayous emptying into the lake between Bayou Cochon and fort Macomb. No stores of any description will be allowed to pass there without the pass of the provost-marshal of the parish, and then only those needed for actual consumption of the inhabitants beyond that point.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

(Care of Commander Gun-boat Fleet, Mouth of White River.)

One brigade of rebel cavalry has returned to Monticello. It is reported by spies that Parsons division is on the way back there. Rebels are picketing encamped on Prairie D'Ane with infantry and artillery. Colonel Logan has been ordered to Caddo Gap with cavalry. About 1,000 troops are said to have gone to Centre Point. This looks like preparing for the return of Price. There are but few troops at Camden and some siege guns. I have sent cavalry to drive in their pickets and develop their movements. General Thayer will need assistance at Fort Smith if Price returns that way. I have sent one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry to Lewisburg and will have rations at that point for any troops that may move toward Fort Smith. I am informed
