Major-General WILLCOX,

Commanding First Division:

I sent by Captain Casey an order to extend your lines so as to embrace Blacks and Whites, relieving the troops of the Third Division. General Hartranft has a brigade at that point. I wish it relieved as soon as possible, so that it may move forward. General Hartranft's headquarters are here. Mine will go to Burkeville to-morrow morning. Please answer.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865.

Major-General PARKE:

Your dispatch of 8.15 just received. Captain Casey arrived just before dark with your orders to extend up to Blacks and Whites. I immediately ordered Harriman to extend to that point, and have sent out orders this evening rearranging the lines of the division. Each brigade will occupy nine miles of the line. I will send a full regiment to Blacks and Whites to relieve Hartranft, but he might withdraw on the arrival of my pickets. Your dispatch does not state where your headquarters are to-night. I will send the regiment to Blackes and Whites to-night.
