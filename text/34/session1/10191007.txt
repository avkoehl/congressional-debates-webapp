34th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Kansas Contested Election—Mr. Sherman.
Ho. of Reps.
evidence in regard to the murder of Doyle. But
the committee adhered to the rule, and excluded
all of it. This was manifestly just, and was
concurred in by Governor King, the counsel of
the sitting Delegate. Under this rule, the robbing
and murder of free-State men, the sacking of
Lawrence and Ossa watomie, and all the multitude
of crimes committed upon that class of settlers,
since our appointment, were excluded; and,
therefore, it was not right *to spread upon our
records an act of retaliation which no man at-
tempts to justify or defend.
I have thus been particular in calling the atten-
tion of the House to those parts of this counter
statement which are not founded upon evidence
taken before the committee. The material facts
in the statement of the minority are contained in
pages from 72 to 84; and these I propose to ex-
amine in detail, because it is the only part that
relates to the matter now before the House. The
committee, in the report, allege—
" Every election has been controlled, not by the actual
settlers, but by citizens of Missouri; and, as a consequence,
every officer in the Territory, from constables to legislators,
except those appointed by the President, owe their positions
to non-resident voters. NoJie have been elected by the
aettiers, and your committee have been unable to find that
any political power whatever, however unimportant, has
been e.Terci?ed by the people of the Territory."
Now, Mr. Speaker, there has been but one
exception taken, by either my colleague or the
gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Stephens,] to this
broad and sweeping declaration; and that excep-
tion is worse than the rule. It is founded upon
the statement of the report that General Whitbeld
did receive a plurality of the legal votes at the
election for Delegate, in November, 1854. The
evidence taken before the committee clearly shows
that, out of the two thousand, eight hundred and
forty-two votes cast, only one thousand one hun-
dred and fourteen were legal votes; one thousand
seven hundred and twenty-nine of the votes cast
for Mr. Whitfield were by residents of Missouri.
This fact is not controverted by the gentleman
from Georgia; and yet the gentleman asks what
evidence there is that fraud or force was used in
the election? Yes, sir, the evidence is full and
qinple. No man who reads) it can question it.
It is true that General Whitfield received a plu-
rality of all the votes east, and the reasons have
been stated; but what would have been the result*
of that election, if the Missourians had not gone
into the Territory, no man can tell. 1 say that
tbe first election in the Territory, in 1854, now
referred to as an exception to the general rule of
force and fraud, will form a dark mark in the'
history of that Territory; and is the more to be
condemned as the first startling event in the prac-
tical working of squatter sovereignty, as admin-
istered in Kansas.
Again: the committee allege that" companies
of men from Missouri wece arranged in regular
parties, and sent into every council district in the
Territory, and into every representative district but
one. The numbers were so distributed as to con-
trol the elections in each district." Does my col-
league deny the facts ? Not at all. But he seeks
to create the impression that this statement is not
correct, by showing that in five election districts
there was no invasioin. Admit if, and yet every
word stated by the committee is true. Three of
these election districts were attached to other elec-
tion districts, to form council and representative
districts. The invasion extended to the election
districts to which they were attached, thus con-
trolling their vote. Thus, the eighth election
district was attached to the seventh, in which two
hundred and nine illegal votes were cast. The
twelfth election district was attached to the elev-
enth, in which three hundred and twenty-one
illegal votes were eastland the seventeenth was
attached to the fourth, in which sixty-five illegal
votes were cast. The ninth and tenth election
districts were attached, and formed the only repre-
tentative district to which the invasion did not
extend. The formation of these districts was well
known to my colleague; and yet, by not observ-
ing them, he seeks to make a contradiction whpr§
none exists, and in doing so, very modestly says;
"These contradictory statements, to the under-
signed, seem wholly inexplicable, and he leaves
them for a majority to reconcile or explain as best
they may." Sir, the fact thus made prominent
by my colleague, that this invading force was so
marshaled as to control all the members of the
Assembly but one, and yet so as not to extend
into five election districts, throws a flood of light
upon the manner in which it was conducted, and
the design of those who moved it.
It shows one feature which is always taken into
consideration in determining the degree, of crime.
It shows deliberation, premeditation, and, to use
a technical phrase, when applied to criminal trans-
actions, malice aforethought. These districts
were carefully conned over. No voting force was
wasted, no man was sent into a district where
his vote was not wanted to control the election;
and so completely was the plan carried into exe-
cution, that while, out of the eighteen election
districts, there was an invasion into only thirteen
of them; yet, in every council district, and in every
representative district except one, the movements
of Missourians extended. Is this denied? If so,
I would like to have my friend from Missouri
state into which council district, and into which
representative district, except the one I have
named, the invasion did not extend.
Mr. STANTON. How did the committee ar-
rive at the number of legal and illegal votes?
Mr. SHERMAN. I will come to that presently.
Now, sir, it is claimed1 by my colleague that the
free-State candidates were not voted for by a
majority of the actual settlers of the Territory.
A table has been prepared by him, to show that
only about eight hundred votes were cast by the
free-State men for free-State candidates. But,
sir, while this is true, it is also true that the pro-
slavery candidates did not, receive the votes of
one fourth of the legal voters of the Territory.
If it is true that the free-State candidates received
only seven hundred and eighty-three votes, it
is equally true that the pro-slavery candidates
received only six hundred and thirty-four legal
votes.
I have here a table showing the number of legal
votes cast in each representative and council dis-
trict:

But it is also true that a majority of the legal
voters of the Territory were kept away from the
polio, and did not vote at all.
The testimony shows, beyond cavil, that a
majority of the people did not vote at all, because
to get to the polls they had to encounter an armed
force of Missourians, and they could not in some
cases vote without fears of personal violence; and
the record shows, that out of more than two
thousand nine hundred legal voters in tbe Terri-
tory, only one thousand four hundred and ten
voted.
My colleague [Mr. Stanton] asks how we
arrived at the number of legal and illegal votes.
Sir, we did not rely upon any general statement
made by witnesses, but made a careful analysis
of the records themselves. The census returns
give the names of all the legal voters in the Ter-
ritory, one month prior to the eleotion; and the
poll-books of the electors give the names of all
those who voted. We compared these, name by
name, and thus we ascertained the names and
number of those settlers who voted.
From this comparison we found, that of two
thousand nine hundred and three legal voters
upon the census list, only eight hundred and
ninety-eight voted. It appeared, however, that
many persons arrived in the Territory after the
taking of the census. We therefore examined
such witnesses, in every election district, as were
best acquainted with the settlers in their districts.
They carefully examined the poll-books, and
testified who of those named on the poll-books
were residents on the day of election; and testi-
mony of this character was taken on both sides.
The result was, that out of six thousand three
hundred men who voted, only one thousand four
hundred and ten were inhabitants of the Terri-
tory. Neither the mode of examination nor the
results of the comparison are called in question
by my colleague.
To weaken the force of the conclusions of the-
committee, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr.
Stephens] resorts to a novel mode of argument.
It is this: By examining the census rolls, he
finds that of the two thousand nine hundred and
five legal voters in the Territory, about one thou-
sand six hundred emigrated from the slave States.
He then'assumes the position, that all tlrtse are
pro-slavery men, and that all were born and bred
in the southern States. Neither of these assump-
tions is true. Very many who emigrated from
Missouri into the Territory are -natives of the
northern States,- Theseare-inehided in th6 1,600.
Very many men born and bred in the South, now
residing in the Territory, are the most zealous
free-State men. This is the case with whole
neighborhoods. Thus, in the fifth district, the'
most'populous in the Territory, a very large ma-
jority of the settlers, as shown by the gentleman's
table, emigrated From southern States; and in this
district, it is proven, and admitted by my col-
league, that a majority of the actual settlers are
for a free State, and so voted. In the only repre-
sentative district to which the ihvasion did not
extend, and whioh elected a free-Stkte tnan, a ma-
jority are from the southern States.
The gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Stephens,]
agreeing in this- with the statement of my col-
league, says that there was no fbrce used in this
election—that no fights occurred. Admit the
statement to be true, and why was there no actual
force used? And why Were there no fights? I
call the attention of the House to the tesimony of
Mr. Chapman upon this point, on page 144. He
was elected a councilman from the Lawrence dis- ;
trict, and was a pro-slavery man. Here is what
he says: .
« We crossed the ravine and came very near the house
of the election. Some gentleman hallooed to me ; I went
backhand we got into conversation about the matter. He
asked nie if I thought there was any prospect of difficulty
here ? 1 told him I thought not. He said he was in hopes
there would not be. 1 told him, if there were citizens enough
in the place to give them a fair fight, they would do it. He
thought there would be no nse in doing that, and invited
me to go down a short distance with him. Mfe went to a
wagon, and be lifted up a cloth and some blankets, and
remarked to me that there was a couple of' bull-dogs' they
had, loaded with musket-balls. They were all covered up
in the bay, with the exception of the rims of them ; tliey
were a couple of brass cannon. I then left there, and went
np to the house where the election was held. I suppose
I was voted <br by them for member of Council on that
day."
Others tell us that such was the feeling among
the citizens theie, that, if there had been a fair
chance, there wo«W have been a fight. There
