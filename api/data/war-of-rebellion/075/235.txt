Captain McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourteenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I arrived here last evening and had quite a sharp fight with two brigades of the enemy just before sunset. We soon whipped them. Our loss is less than 150 killed and wounded; the enemy's considerably more. They retreated during the night, leaving us in possession of the strongest fortified place I have seen in Dixie. I shall bridge the river, and as soon as possible, join the corps. I have only four days' rations. Please call the general's commanding attention to the fact so that I may receive them as soon as I arrive.

I am, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Colonel Wiles and Major Shea, Twenty-second Indiana, are among the wounded.
