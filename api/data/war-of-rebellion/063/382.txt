HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Cairo, Ill., May 1, 1864.

Brigadier General J. W. DAVIDSON,

Commanding Cavalry Bureau, Saint Louis:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Sherman (by telegraph) to direct that all the cavalry regiments at Saint Louis belonging to the Sixteenth Army Corps be sent forward without any delay to Memphis. He is of the opinion that until they obtain horses they can be of good service as garrisons, and that the horses can follow as soon as practicable. You will please cause the necessary orders to be given and have the men, both those now at Saint Louis and those who may arrive, forwarded with all possible dispatch. I again urge the controlling necessity for pushing forward horses as soon as practicable.

I am, general, very truly, your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General, Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Please ask Colonel Cole, chief of artillery, which company of his regiment, Second [Missouri] Artillery, he prefers should be sent to Bloomfield, Company C, Captain Fuchs, or Company H, Captain Montgomery. Company H has lately arrived here. Company C has been here a long time. It is not material to us, and he may have a preference. Please answer immediately, as they are to start in the morning.
