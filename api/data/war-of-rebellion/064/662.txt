OFFICE DEPOT COMMISSARY,

Shreveport, La., June 10, 1864.

Major W. H. THOMAS,

Chief Commissary of Subsistence, Trans-Miss. Dept.:

MAJOR: I herewith hand you a statement* of all the stores received up to this date and of those shipped to General Taylor's army. In answer to your communication of this date I will state that your instructions to me have been to ship, before the river falls, to Major A. H. Mason, chief commissary of subsistence, District of West Louisiana, 15,000 bushels of corn, equal to 750,000 rations of corn meal, and all the tithe bacon that would be collected at this depot, which cannot be less than 300,000 rations; also all the pease, soap, and candles not necessary for this post and the hospitals in the vicinity. In addition to this I will that I expect to ship 150,000 rations of flour. I inferred from the tenor of Major Mason's communications that he was in no pressing need of other stores than flour, which I shipped to him as I received it. He seemed only to fear the fall of the river ere he might be sufficiently supplied for the season, which has been dispelled by the recent rise, which promises to last for at least two months, during which time he can be amply supplied.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. B. SMITH,

Captain and Assistant Commissary of Subsistence.

Extract of letters received from Major A. H. Mason, chief commissary of subsistence, District of West Louisiana, in relation to supplies.

At the depot at Mansfield, 75 barrels flour; 6,500 pounds hard bread; 130 tierces mess beef, or 45,500 pounds; bacon 14,000 pounds; corn meal, 400 bushels; sugar, 6,000 pounds; soap, 800 pounds; coffee, 800 pounds; salt, 5,000 pounds. Depot at Keachie, bacon, 50,000 pounds; corn meal, 500 bushels. I will state that most of our cavalry have gone below with eight or ten days' rations. In the event of our moving below, please push forwarded by boats as rapidly as possible breadstuffs and meats.

April 13, 1864.- * * * Fifteen wagon loads of flour have arrived. Accept my warmest thanks for your promptness in forwarding these supplies. I shall be under renewed obligations to you to continue.

April 19, 1864.- * * * Have sent to Beasley's 70,000 rations of breadstuffs, meat, and salt, by order General Polignac, approved by General Taylor. Will leave at Mansfield 15,000 or 20,000 rations. April 23, 1864.- The reason why we are pressed for supplies is that the supply train order to Beasley's will be left there in the event of an emergency of we have to fall back.

April 28, 1864.- * * * The Era, Numbers 7, with commissary stores, has arrived. * * * We are collecting a good many small cattle.
