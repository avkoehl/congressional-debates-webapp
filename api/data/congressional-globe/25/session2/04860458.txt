CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
resolved itself into a Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, Mr. Connor in the
chair.
Mr. CAMBRELENG moved the consideration
of the " bill to provide for the collection, safe-
keeping, tiansfer, and disbursement of the public
revenue "
Mr SERGEANT moved the "harbor bill,"
which, he said, it was very impoitant should be
acted upon. It would not, he believed, consume
much time.
Mr CAMBRELENG remarked that it must be
obvious that the bill he had moved, being the only
debatable mearme remaining for the present, had
better be disposed ol first, after which the regular
business might be proceeded with
The quesuon being taken on the first motion, by
tellers, and there being 132 voting for it, more than
a uiajoiity of ihe whole Hou«e, the "Independent
Treasury bill" was accordingly taken up, and hav-
ing been read thiough by the Clerk,
Mr CAMBRELENG, who was of course en-
title 1 to the floor, gave way, at his request, to
Mr THOMPSON of South Carolina, who moved
the following substitute
Strike out all after the words, " Be it enacted,"
e'c and insert " That all dues to the Government
shall hereafter be collected m gold and silvei com,
Treasury notes of ihe United Slates, and the notes
of soun! specie-pa) ing banks under such legula-
tions and lesiuctions as may be prescribe! by act
of Congiess, oi by the Secretar} of the Tieasurj,
Vioiuled, That no bink notes shall be received as
aforesaid, except such 3s ihe bank of deposite shall
agres to recen e and credit as cash
2   Be it futtiter enacted, That the Secretaiy of
theTreasuiy be, and he is hereby, requned to se-
lect as special depositories of the public funds, and
at such places as may be necessary, sound specie-
pajing banks, preferring, in ill oases where such
exist, banks owned m whole or in part by the
Stit s in which the same are situated
3   Be d faither enacted, That the Secretary be,
and he is hereby, directed to conlract with the
banks selected as depositories aforesaid, for the
safe keeping, transfer, and disbursement < f the
public revenue, on such terms, and for such com-
pensation, as he may deem right and proper, stipu-
lating in all case , under such guaranties as he
may think necessary, that the public funds deposi-
ted with said banks shall be in no case used in
their business, nor otherwise used but in payment
of dralts fiom thp Treasuiy
Mr GARLAND of Virginia then said he would,
with leave of the gentleman from New York, sub-
mit a motioi which, without the resort to any
amendment or substitute, would test the sense of
the House on the merits of the bill He moved to
strike out the enacting clause
Mr CAMBRELENG then addressed the com-
mit'ee as follows
Mr C said he would not detain the committee
long, as the bill under consideration was accompa-
nied bv a detailed renort on its provisions and
principles Indeed, any extensive aigument in
suppoit of ihe measure had b-en rendered unneces-
saiy by recent events, which had swept away
almost every matenal objection hitherto urged
ag-unst it
The Sob-Treasury, as it is called, or the collec-
tion, keeping, aid disbursement, of the public reve-
nue by our own oflicets, was esfablished by the
t-uspension of the banks in May, 1837 When we
assembled in S>plemüer last, it was pioposed to
regulat th Treasury by paiticular laws appiica-
b'e to i s actual coiJmon The measure was
immediately and fiercely resisted as an alarming
innovation, calculated to rum trade, destroy the
banks, and to bieak up the foundations of civil
society Such was the panic language uttered
heie during the late extra session, and spread
throughout the hi 1 Th s desolating measure,
the Sub-Treasuiy, has now been m full opera-
tion for moie than thirteen months Trade has
recovered from the lowest point of depression, con-
li lence is restored, and the banks have resumed
specie payments at the very places where the
largest poition of our revenue is collected, and
where the T easury is most powerful. The argu-
ments and predictions of gentlemen are thus tri-
umphantly íefuted and contradicted
Notwithstanding these satisfactory results, it is
still attempted to excite the fears of those who
are engaged in trade. The mere idea of debating
the question is made a subject of alarm, the press
encourages the most fearful apprehensions, the
stock exchange ism commotion, and the banks, af-
ter promising resumption, are suddenly arrested
And what is the foundation for all this commotion
and alarm' How can it possibly affect the trade
or banks of the country, whether Congress should
or should not regulate by particular laws, a system
which is already established by a few general laws,
and which must in any event be continued for
years to come? Suppose we reject this bill, and
go home, does the Sub-Treasury cease? No, sir,
it must continue, as it is now, the law of the land,
and will continue thiough 1838, '39, MO, and Ml,
in spite oí all the lamentations here or elsewhere
The non-resuming banks are especially alarmed.
But a short time since the passage of the bill re-
pealing the Specie Circular, was hailed as a mea-
sure removing the last difficulty to the resumption
of the banks generally Another circular appear-
ed, and they weie suddenly arrested in their pro-
gress to resumption This circular embraced
nothing but the piovisions of the laws of 183$, and
made no change, except what was required by the
act repealing the Specie Cucular. The same in-
structions were, m pursuance of that law, given to
every receiving and collecting officer throughout
the Union The circular directs, what the law re-
quires, that no notes shall be received but those
which aie redeemable in specie at the place where
they are received. This has been our uniform
practice, under every system, and it is not probable
we shall ever repeal that regulation It also directs,
in obedience to the act of April, 1838, that no note
shall be received of a less denomination than twenty
dollars
It i  a matter of little moment to the banks whe-
ther one thousand and millions of revenue are col-
lected in their notes of twenty dollars and upwards,
so long as their notes "re receivable lor publicdue3
There is but one provision which can affect any of
the banks, and that is the restriction in the act of
June, 1836, which prohibits the receipt of thenotes
of any bank which has issued, since the 4th July,
1836, any bill or note of a less denomination than
five dollars It happens, unfortunately for the
Bank of the United Slates, and most of the other
banks acting in concert with that institution, that
their notes are not excluded by this provision in the
act of 1836 On the contrary, while these banks
would, if they resume, enjoy this special privilege,
the notes of almost all the banks which have al-
ready resumed cannot be received. So far, then,
as the recent circular operates at all, the Bank of
the United States and its associa'es have every in-
ducement to resume, m order that their notes may
be íeceived in payment of public dues, while the
notes of other banks are excluded
But, it seems, these non-resuming banks can do
nothing till they know Ihe fate of this bill Why,
sir, if all the complaint is that the law, as it stands,
prohibits the receipt of the notes of banks which
have issued notes of a less denomitntion than five
dollars, they should anxiously desire the passage of
the bill, foi one of its provisions effectually repeals
the restriction m the act of 1836, and authorizes
the receipt of the notes of all specie paying banks
immediately, and for a time, and chiefly m such
notes for years tocóme That is the only provi-
sion of the bill which can possibly affect the ques-
tion of resumption The Other provisions, so far
as they relate to the co'lection, keeping, and dis-
bursement of the revenue, are subst-mtiaily now m
force, and must remain so until we substitute bank
agents for our own officers, which no one now con-
tem plate* The defeat of this bill cannot, therefore,
affect any of the banks, except unfavorably, as it
would leave the restriction of the act of 1836 unmo-
dified and unrepealed But neither its passage or
deff-at can in any manner affect the Bank of the
United Slates, as the existing restr.ction does not
exclude the notes of that institution, whenever it
may resume specie payments.
Whatever course, sir, the banks may think pro-
per to pursue, it is our duty to supply the defi-
ciency in our laws regulating our Treasury. That
Department has been left, for more than a year,
acting under the authority of a few ancient laws,
and the Secretary has beeh necessarily compelled
to provide by Treasury Orders for the collection,
keeping, and disbursement of our revenue. I am
unwilling to believe that a majority of either House
are disposed longer to leave so large a discretion to
any public officer. It must be obvious to every
gentleman that no matenal modification of our ex-
isting revenue system can be anticipated, if ever,
until 1842, and it remains for us to decide whether
Congress, or the Secretary of the Treasury, shall,
for four years to come, provide all the regulations
necessary in the operations of that most important
Department ®f our Government.
There is no prospect, at present, of any material
change m our existing system of managing our
revenue. No Bank oí the United States can be
chartered, if at all, for four years to come, and the
Stats bank deposite act has nullified itself. By that
act, no bank can be employed as a depotite bank
which has, since the 4th July, 1836, issued or paid
out any note or bill of a less denomination than
five dollars. What bank is there m the United
States, whether of issue or not, which has not, dur-
ing the suspension, "paid out" i bill or note of a
less denomination than five dollars'? No such sys-
tem can be revived until that restriction is repeal-
ed, and any such proposition would certainly be
rejected. Even if new banks are established, it
cannot be supposed that the Secretary of the Trea-
suiy, after what has occurred, would feel himself
authorized to employ any bank, without requiring
ample security in actual funds, immediately avail-
able in any emergency, a*nd equal to any amount
which might at any time remain in deposite. Nor
is it probable that he would consider it a faithful
or just compliance with the law, to re-establish a
State bank deposite system for some States, while
all the others were under Treasury regulations,
thus giving to the banks in one section the profits
on the use of the public money, contraiy to the de-
sign of the act None but a general State bank
deposite system, if any, can be adopted, and such
would require, if ever proposed, a thorough revi-
sion of the late law.
So far then, as it regards thequestion of bank agen-
cy, it must be considered as poslponed,atleast, till the
time may arrive when both Houses of Congress
and the Executive accord in opinion—a harmony
which has not often existed for many Administra-
tions past, and of which there is no chance whatever
till 1842, even if it should then happen.
The next question relates to the receipt of bank
notes in payment of public dues 1 trust we are
not about, from mere opposition to this particular
measure, to run into the opposite extreme, and, as
some gentlemen propose, make permanent pro-
vision for receiving the notes of specie paying
banks, of every denomination whatsoever On this
question a very large majority of both Houses
have hitherto adopted stjfnd principles—they have
been hard money men, and this is certainly not a
time when either House should abandon on this
important question any ground previously occupied
One of the propositions which has been repeatedly
made at the present session in both Houses, is to
repeal the 2d section of the act of 14th April, 1836,
viz
"That, kereaftei, no bank note of a less denomination than
ten dollars, and that fiom and after the 3d day of March, anno
Domini eighteen hundred and thirty seven, no bank note oí a
less denomination than twenty dolíais, shall be ofFeied in pay
ment m any case whatsoever in whieh money is to be paid by
the tinted States or the Post Office Department, noi shall any
bank note, of any denomination, be bo offered, unless the same
shall be payable and paid on demand, in gold or silver coin, at
the p ace wheie raued, and which sha I not be equivalent to
specie at the place wnere off. red, and convertible in  gold or
si ver upon the snot, at the will of the holder and without delay
or lo«stohim, Provided That nothing herein contained shall
beconstiuettomakeany thing but gold or silver a 1 gal tender
by any individual or by the Umted States "
Prom the moment the receipt of bank notes was
tolerated in payment of public dues, this regula-
tion should have been adopted as a special duty of
the Federal Government, whatever laws the States
and trade might prescribe for themselves The
Constitution has assigned to us the care of the cur-
rent com of the country, and our Federal revenues
