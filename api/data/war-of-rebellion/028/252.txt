Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

I have telegraphed General Wool that a rebel force is coming in the direction of Cumberland and New Creek, Md., and urgently requested that the force at Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg be sent to those points to co-operate with force in this direction. They can be of great benefit at these points. The Second Cavalry defeated and routed Jenkins in Kanawha Valley.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

The Governor of Pennsylvania wishes the services of General Reynolds. Can your order him here for that purpose?

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Reynolds is now engaged on important service, supporting with his division an attack on New Market. He has one of the best divisions, and is well acquainted with it. I cannot see how his services can be spared at the present time.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Middlebrook, Md., September 11, 1862-12 noon.

(Received 3.45 a. m., September 12.)

Major-General HALLECK:

I was informed by Mr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, previous to leaving Washington, that he could transport 28,000 infantry in one day in the cars under his control. In view of this, and the importance of having General Porter's command join me soon, I would suggest that it be sent by rail to Frederick. By this means it would reach me two days earlier than by making the overland march, and would be fresh on its arrival. Porter's trains might come by land.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,

September 11, 1862-1.55 p. m.

Major-General McCLELLAN, Rockville, Md.:

General Reynolds' division can be commanded by some one else. He has been designated for other duty, and must report here immediately.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
