I wish you to assure them that I can say, in perfect sincerity, with fullest knowledge of our positions and chances, and with an unabated confidence in the justice of our cause, that we have but one course to take, and that is to manfully and honorably meet our responsibilities as soldiers and citizens.

By pursuing it, we will obtain the best conditions ever granted to the unfortunate side in an appeal to arms for a settlement of national differences-even our enemies will respect our manliness and consistency and do justice to our motives.

Your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.
