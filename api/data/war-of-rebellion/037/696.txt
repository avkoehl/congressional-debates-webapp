June 22,[1863.]

Major: The usual sharpshooting from the enemy in front of my lines yesterday. In the evening, the 3-inch rifle on Fort Hill opened fire to get the range of the enemy's works, to attempt and prevent any work being done during the night, when the enemy opened a heavy artillery fire on my left. The enemy continued to strengthen the works on the hill above Edwards', and are also constructing new ones from the river in the direction on the mound at Mint Spring Bayou.

Very respectfully,

JNumber C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.
