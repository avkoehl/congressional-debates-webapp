Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

Fleet now arriving here. Weather cold. Ice forming in the river. Navigation below Pittsburg reported unsafe by ice. All well advised boatmen agree that it would be entirely unsafe attempting to go above Cinccinnati until a change of weather for several days. Hence, on consultation with General Schofield and General Allen, have ordered trnasportation by rail from Cincinnati. They will begin to leave from Cincinnati to-morrow, and arrive there as fast as the roads can transport them.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH, Esq.,

Master of Transport., Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore, Md.:

Now arriving here. Owing to ice in the river will be compelled to take cars at Cincinnati. About one-third to-morrow noon and the balance the two following days. The number is about one-third more than was supposed when I left W. Will you see that coffee is provided every six or eight hours in large quantities? I go to Cincinnati to-ngiht. Let me hear from you. Cannot you get machinery from the Pennsylvania Central and the Northern Cross [Central?] Railroad, so as to move more than you suggested? Please see cars are thoroughly provided with hay or straw and stoves, as the weather threatens to be very cold. I would suggest one tier of seats around the inside of the car.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
