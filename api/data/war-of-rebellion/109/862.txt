Richmond, Va.:

Following dispatch just received:

IVOR, 14.

Have received dispatch from my scouts this side of Suffolk, whom I supposed captured. They are right in the midst of the Yankees. Report the Yankees on all the roads leading toward Suffolk. Yankees were at Windsor, Providence Church, and several other points to-day. Exact force this side of the town not definitely known, but considerable. The force sent to Blackwater this a. m. numbered about 1,500. They landed also about 600 men with two pieces artillery at Chuckatuck this morning. Lieutenant Roy's scouts and my detachment skirmishedwith them, losing 2 men and capturing 3. Will send prisoners up to-morrow. The enemy will probably develop his designs to-morrow. Burnside's whole force will reach 20,000. I can hold the Blackwater should he attempt to cross. One more regiment here will make it sure. No Yankee deserters have come in to me.

Captain N. W. SMALL,

Signal Headquarters:

I came out the lines this morning. Learned that the greater part of Burnside's corps landed at Portsmouth on Monday, the 11th. Their destination supposed to be Weldon and Goldsborough via Suffolk. Their gun-boats went up the Nansemond last night. Could hear nothing of Kilpatrick. Will send paper by next train.

Major PICKETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Signal scouts just out of the enemy's line below Nansemond River report General Burnside's corps near Suffolk, supposed to number from 15,000 to 20,000. Destination, as gathered from reliable citizens, supposed to be Goldsborough and Weldon. It is probable they are ready to move, if they have not already done so. The cavalry force reported this morning still in the vicinity of Zuni, on Blackwater.

JAMES D. RADCLIFFE,

Colonel, Commanding.

Some of Whiting's troops should be sent up at once to Goldsborough, if not to Weldon. I had ordered one of Clingman's regiments down to Ivor, but will detain it till I hear from you. In case you think its destination should be changed, please reply.
