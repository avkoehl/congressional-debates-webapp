for military and financial reasons, much preferable, the President has directed the new levies to be confined to three- years" men. Recent advices from General Banks state that he has saved his command with small loss.

AUGUSTA, ME., May 27, 1862.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

On the strength of General Thomas" dispatch yesterday stopped raising three-months" men, and am raising only the three-years" regiment previously called for. Is this right?

I. WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, May 27, 1862.

His Excellency GOVERNOR OF MAINE,

Augusta, Me.:

Discharge all three-months" men you have enlisted and fill up the three-years's regiment as rapidly as possible.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 27, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

The President directs that the militia be released and the enlistments made for three years or during the war. This, I think, will practically not be longer than for a year. The latest intelligence from General Bank states that he has saved nearly his whole command with small loss. Concentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture the enemy.
