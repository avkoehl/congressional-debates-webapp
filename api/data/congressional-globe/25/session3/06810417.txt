25th Cong....3d Sess.
Conduct of the Adminütratwn—Mr. Kennedy.
Ho. of Reps.
Fresh difficulties have thickened around him at
every stage of his progress from that day In
the south the Indian wai has been but a series of
disasters We have been baffled, exhausted, beat-
en, by a handful of «savages On the northern
frontici our weakntss has become a by-word of
contempt This gieat Republic, in the hands of
its present ruléis, is not even able to preserve its
neutrality in the domestic rebellion of a Power
with whom we piofess to hold the most friendly
relations, and we are obliged to confess our in-
abi'ity to ¡estrain tne armaments of our own citi-
zens, which are directed against a neighbor's
peace. Yes, in, even to submit to the humilia-
tion Gf hav ng our own temtory visited, oui ves-
sels seized, and our cituens slaughteied m our
own harbor, by that neighbor Power, on the plea
of weakness to enfoice our laws.
In the embarrass merits which have been brought
apon our fiscal affairs, in the piostiation of the
agiieultuial, the meirantile, and the manufactur-
ing prosperity of the country, the Administration
has been ableto suggestno adequate lehef We
stt uggle along upon expedients The msinsita of
the nation, its intrinsic vigor, which notevon mis-
govetnment has been able totally to crush, has,
by slow degrees, begun to revive the prospeuty
ot the land, but the Government has done noth-
ing Whatever might be expected from the pa-
triotism, the virtue, the intelligence of the people,
they have nobly íeahzed, whatevei has been left
to the Government has languished and faded in
its hands. The guaidians of the Tteasuty have
fallen asleep, fdonii s, unmatched in enoimity,
have been detected in the inreimost slmneof the
temple, the very priests hive robbed the altar,
the nation has but extricated itself fiom one debt
to eieate another, the finances are in confusion,
the revenue inadequate to the expendituie, oui
hard money Government has fallen into a paper
manufactunng Government, ou r rulers are at the ir
Wit\ end, ail around aie the signs of theirdoom,
he warnings of their downfall The tiuth stands
tonfessed—.it is felt in every department of the
¡ubhc affairs—that the President and his friends
u-e incompetent to the crisis; thev want abil-
ity
Turn, an, to the Executive mansion, and in-
quire what they are who at this moment guide
the foitunes of this land An easy, indolent, lux-
tttious chief piesides over a Cabinet, of which it
would be flattery to say that it was a mere pel
sonation of feebleness To the membeis of that
Cabinet, personally, sir, so far as a veiy limited
ncquaintance may «arrant, I am willing to acooid
all consideiation and respect I speak of them
hcie as a public body A more diversified com
pound of ciulncss, inaptitude, and ignorance of
official duty, a gieatei lack of encigy, a moie
BOiely peiplexed, bewildered, and dismayed as-
sociation of State eounselois were never, perhaps,
exhibited around a council table than may, at this
present juncture, be seen in the daily anxious
confeienees of this piecious Cabinet Since the
days of the men y monarch of England, and his
hau brained crony Rochester, never weie the des-
tinies of a great nation mti usted to more incom-
petent hands
I might except from this censure, and do ex-
cept, one who hab the reputation of being a reg-
ular attendant at these council meetings—1 doubt
not the first to come and the last to depart—a
person more notonous than distinguished, and
yet, sir, boasting no small claim to distinction
I mean that man-of all work, whose marvelous
exaltation from the kitchen up to the chamber
nearest to the King is one of the most stuking
moial significations of the times This, sir, is
his administration Whatever remainder of effi-
cacy it has is his, whatever of shrewdness, of
cohesion, of malice, or of mischief it has, belongs
to him By his sufferance does eveiy member of
that Cabinet hold his place—or did, sir, for I trust
his influence is drawing to an end Yea, even
the placid and pliant chief h mself has found his
account in the good will of this Meplnstophiles
He is the link between the past Administration
and the piesent, the conduit-pipe by which the
suiplus popularity of the one is transfused into
the waning circulation of the othei, the ligament
that still unites the small fortunes of the polished
ar-d pleasure-loving tenant of the palace to the
No. 27
more robust destiny of the grim and fearful lion
that has his lair at the Hermitige
But for this one mfoi ming spmt, yonder whole
Cabinet anav of impracticable, skillless, tempo-
uzing, expedient mongeitng statesmen would,
long befoie this, have floundered to the bottom
of that pool of turbid paitv-waters in which they
now Miuggle for respuation The day, su,is
not remote when they and then guardian genius
shall «ink together in this oozy tide, and be re
membeied no more
Mr Chanman, I take some consolation in this
melanchoiy view of the public affaus, fiom the
conviction that (he nation has been already driven
by headstiong counsel, by weakness, and by pas-
sion, to that extreme from which it cannot but
happen that the tide of Government shall flow
back into a safer channel Out of the very in-
competency of our present rulers do I gather food
for hope There are already, sir, marifold signs
of restoration We cannot mistake them We
are on the backwaid maich fiom Jacksomsm
The footsteps weie abandoned at the first stnde
The great reaction has commenced, and we shall
go on uniavelmg this web which, tor ten years
past, the chief functionaries of this Government
have been so busilv weaving around the Consti-
tution
It might have been foreseen—indeed, it was
foicseen and piedicted—that no successor could
wear the lepubhcan crown of our great milittiy
President     The powei which he aecumulnti d it
required his aim to wield     By one of moie di
mmutive size, oi smallei  strength, it would be
found a gnevous buidiu     Mi   Van Bmen was
deceived, sit, not only in the computation of his I
own capacity, but in thenatuieand value of the |
boon which his nomination to the succession ten- j
deied to him     He little knew the estimate \v Inch .
the  Ameriain  people foimed of him, when  he 1
imagined that lie could  occupy the stition,  oi
maich  m the path of Geneial Tackson     There '
was no luster around his name to bewildei the
gaze of the country, or to hallow an act of usurp
ation     He is the Piesident by appointment, not
by choice, and the career of his predecessor, sus-
tained only by the foice of unexampled peisonal
popularity, could,m none of itsdangeious haps,
be followed by one who deuved no suppoit fiom i
the affection  of the  people, nor aid fiom their'
ability     The consequence was inevitable that the
present Admmistiation must abandon thf  hope
of imitating the last, and even letiaot the perilous I
enors,both of policy and ofdoctune, into which |
that Admmistiation had stiayed     Accordingly, |
you shall find, Mi   Chanman, that it is even so
First, in this backwaid movement, I would
have you note that we have no ariogant mes-
sages from the White House To the credit of 1
our piesent Chief Magistrate, every one must
acknowledge the mildness of tone, the diffidence, j
and the moderation of his official communication
at the opening of the piesent session It is, sir,
stukmgly, a message of íecantation, and speaks
m a temper of contrition, as if its authoi had felt
the chastening of affliction But fifteen months
ago, at the extra session, the President had de-
clared the constitutional incapacity of the Gov-
ernment to aid commercial operations, now, he
boasts of the Government agency m restoung
the commercial action, and very undeseivedly, in
my opinion, claims ciedit for it
Until lately the Administration was clamorous
foi a total divorce of the banks fiom the Govern-
ment here, in this paper, is a waim encomium
on the banks, and an avowal of the useful con
ditions on which they may be connected with
the public concerns
"Like other State establishments the} maj be used or
not in conducting the affairs, of the Government, Da public
policv and the general mteresB of the Union may seem to
require  '
' VV lien the Government can accomplish i An ineial op
oration bettor with the aid of the banks than without it
«hould be at liberty to seek that aid  —Message of Decern
ber, lb3b
This message, too, casts aside the hackneyed
phrase of the "constitutional cuneney," and
adopts a much moie rational term, " the consti-
tutional standaid of value"—a substitution of
gieat significance and omen for the ifflection of
I those who have heretofore indentified the notion
| of Jacksomsm with a metallic currency
It is tiue the message again recomment's, though
faintly and with shyness, tha  ill fated and unlucky
sub-Tieasuiy bill Alas, sir, there was nothing
else left' Out of the very banenness of tha soil
does it come The evil genius of the President
once persuaded him to write a letter to a membei
of this House, [iMi Sheiikard Williams 1 It
was done in the days of his vain gjoiy That
letter pledges him, as by a vow, against the only
permanent iclief to the cuneney of the ration
which the times demand, and he has not yet
(though I piedict it will not be very long before he
does so) taken heart to break the spell In the
mean time, this shadowy specter of a sub-Treas-
ury—the felon bill it may be more aptly called—
rises up, not to gain the favoi, but to divert the
thoughts of the countiy
The second step in the i «action to which I have
alluded is, the abandonment of that whole scheme,
so fimous in the annals of the last Presidency—
of Executive lesponsibdity
Sir, the unity of the Executive has dissipated
into thin air Instead oi being a unit, it is mult,-
foim—a polygon—a many headed monster—and
of moie heads than aims—not Bnaieus, but Hy-
dra In this mattei of the defalcations, Mi Van
Buren is no man for tisponsibility, neither is any

Then, sit, we have no more lectuiing on the
h ird-money dogmi We have come back to the
toleration of paper, nay, sn,we have become
ultia in this paper mongeiing The President is
the patron of free banking His confidential friend
on this floor, the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, [Mr C uibrfi ekg,] at the last
session gave us a panegyric on the conservative
propei ty of that great system The Government
is in close alliance with the monster The lion
and the lamb have laid down together, and the
Pieasuiy is now the chief fountain of the despised
rag money Even the much talked of increase of
the specie basts has fallen into oblivion Not a
woid in its favor has been uttered at the present
session     The message upon it is dumb
These aie all changes of high import, they are
the visible and conspicuous signs of reaction
Sir, m the name of the country, I thank Mr Van
Buien foi these tokens of repentance—for even

Mi Chanman, it will be observed that, as the
Admmistiation deserts its former test-principles
and measures, it is busy to fíame new devices
for paity association Political management has,
very íecently, entered afresh field Wehavehad
most suddenly conjured up abolition for the
Whigs, and the defense of slavery for " the
party " The Whigs, sir, have been sagaciously
attempted to be identified, by the Administration
press, with that unhappy noithern excitement
against slaveiy which, until the commencement
of the present session, no man was so blind as not
to perceive had pursued its caieei without the
slightest connection with paities, which, until
then, too, sir, no man was so unpnncipled as to
assert had sought the aid of a special political alli-
ance with fnend or foe of the Admmistiation
Sir, it is curious to note the slippery equivoca-
tion, the distortion, the desperate legeidcmam of
deception, of the official organ," The Globe,'' on
this subject
Not even the ponderous momentum of false-
hood, which long use and munificent Government
