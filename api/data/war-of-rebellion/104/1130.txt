HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, March 20, 1865.

Colonel G. G. GARNER,

Chief of Staff, Mobile:

COLONEL: I have the honor to state that Captain Tutt reports by telegraph, as coming from Colonel Spence, that the enemy are moving toward Greenwood from Camp Withers; also that another column is moving in the same direction from the mouth of Fish River; also that a scout of Captain Morgan's reports that sixteen transports and four gun-boats have passed up Fish River to-day. I have been unable so far to find out the exact status of the enemy. The opposing parties seem to have missed each other in some unaccountable way. At last accounts, since dark, Colonel Spencer was at Whitby's Bridge, on Fish River, trying to make discoveries through his scouts in various directions as to the locality of the enemy. This afternoon, from 2 o'clock to dark, fifteen gun-boats have bees healing the eastern shore, from Rock Creek to the village, about six miles. No damage was done, except to houses. No lives lost. At about dusk the gun-boats withdrew, some back to the fleet, others down the bay. The hard rain now taking place will probably again interrupt the enemy's movements and give me some little time to get ready for them. Spanish Fort is in a less state of preparation now than this place, and I desire to put all the work on it that I can. The officers there, I fear, do not take the same interest in it that they do here, and I have instructed Captain Grayson to pay particular attention to hastening the completion of the defenses there, at the same time devoting as much of my time to it as can be spared from other duties. I shall not expect you to send any re-enforcements unless you deem it advisable, although they could be well used on works should you send them; that is, if yours hold not be threatened on the Mobile side and cans pare them.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain TUTT,

Commanding at Greenwood:

Three vessels have landed at Battle's Wharf. Cannot tell whether they are loaded with troops or not; the enemy are shelling the shore. Send me all the news you have. What have you heard from Colonel Spence? The operator has left at Montrose.
