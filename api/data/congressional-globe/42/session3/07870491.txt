THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

in da* time through every part of the community,
sources of jealousy and prejudice wonld be dimin-
ished, the features of national character would bo
multiplied, and greater extent given to social har-
mony. But above all a well constituted seminary
in the center of a nation is recommended by the
consideration that the additional instruction eman-
ating from it would contribute not less to strengthen
the foundations than to adorn the structure of our
free and happy system of government."
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman,
I am of course opposed to all schemes which
look, as this does, to placing the education of
our children under the control of the General
Government.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. So we all are.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. We are central-
izing and consolidating all the powers, rights,
and duties of the States rapidly enough to
satisfy the most ardent admirers of personal
supremacy. Already in at least one third of
the States the ballot-box is controlled and
State officers are declared elected or defeated
by Federal authority, against the known facts,
according as they are subservient or otherwise
to their masters here. Senators and Repre-
sentatives (so called) occupy their positions
by Federal orders, not by State authority or
the suffrages of the people. If the education
of the rising generation is to be manipulated
from Washington, and the postal telegraph is
to be attached to our central machinery, with
the hordee of officials which these schemes !
add to the already almost fabulous host of
officeholders, whose daily bread depends not i
on their capacity, fitness, or integrity, but
their party fealty, I see no hope for repub-
lican liberty.
The railroads, the express companies, will
next be seized on some such plausible pretext
as the immigration bill suggests, and the Pres-
ident be made as thoroughly an autocrat as
the emperor of Austria or the Czar of Russia.
I was glad to see the distinguished gentlemen
from Connecticutand Illinois [Governor Haw-
let and General Farnsworth] sound the
alarm the other day. I hope the warning will
be heeded. But I cannot elaborate that now.
I propose to show that we are in no condition
pecuniarily to engage in such vast enterprises,
and that we ought rather to be endeavoring
to reduce taxation, lighten burdens, enforce
economy and honest administration, than be
launching out in new schemes of expenditure
or plunder.
It has not only grown to be a common but
an almost universal practice whenever an ap-
propriation bill is presented for the gentleman
in charge of it to notify the country through
the House that it is a reduction on former bills
of like character. The frequent repetition of
these statements are of course expected to
make the country believe that expenditures are
being cut down, that the burdens of taxation
are to be lightened, and that honesty, frugal-
ity, and the strictest economy are to be en-
forced in all the Departments of the Govern-
ment.
I know how useless it is to expose all these
pretenses, how readily the party cry of Demo-
cratic exaggeration, if not of falsehood, an-
swers all our exposures; and I am specially
well advised of that security the leaders of the
dominant party feel since they have obtained
a new lease of power for four years more, so
that neither their books, accounts, or acts can
be investigated except to the extent they see
fit to exhibit and explain them. Still there
are facts which cannot be denied, and figures
that cannot be blotted out, which the taxpay-
ers ought to see and be reminded of, as they
falsify all pretenses of economical or honest
administration more clearly than the most
eloquent speeches. I propose to set forth a
few of them, as furnished from official sources,
running over the seven years just closed,
beginning with 1866 and ending with 1872.
I shall give, first, the amount of money
which the taxpayers of the country have fur-
nished to the managers of public affairs during
that period, and then show what has been
done with it; or rather, as I have only five
minutes, ask some of those who have had the
disposition of it to let us know. The follow-
ing sums have been paid into the Treasury
from customs and internal taxation :

During the same period the Secretary of
War lets us know that several of the bureaus
in his Department had sold property belonging
to the people of the United States, which had
been bought and paid for by them, for which
$135,414,687 was received, (see Executive
Document No. 200, second session Forty-
Second Congress,) as follows:
Quartermaster stores and transfers from subsist-
ence $107,959,416
Subsistence exclusive of transfers  4,690,876
Surgeon General's sales  5,233,977
Ordnance sales  17,132,018
Engineers' sales 
398,400 j
Total $135,414,687 '
It will be observed that the sales made by
the Freedmen's Bureau and several other
bureaus of the War Department are not em-
braced in the above statement. As I could
not obtain them accurately, I preferred to omit
them.
The Secretary of the Navy shows in his re-
port to Congress at its last session, in answer
to my resolution, that his Department had re-
ceived from sales of property during the last
seven years, and from an excess of old appro-
priations, rendered unnecessary by the cessa-
tion of hostilities, the sum of $111,890,812.
(See Executive Document No. 250, second
session Forty-Second Congress.) All of this
was as much the money of the people of the
United States as if they had paid it out of their
pockets during the year it was spent, or depos-
ited it in the Treasury ; it was the proceeds of
the sale of their bonds, or had been collected
by the tax-gatherer in former years.
During the same period, the Post Office
Department collected from the people the
following sums, as shown by the reports of
the several Postmasters General:
186 6  $14,386,984
186 7  15,247,027
1868   16,292,600

1871   20,037,145
1872.  21,915,426
Total   $125,995,914
The Patent Office collected during these
seven years the following sums :
1866   $495,665
186?    646,581
im'T:.'.'.'.':.  681,565

The various laws providing for the expenses
of the issue, reissue, transfer, redemption, &c.,
of United States securities, currency, &c.,
authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to
retain from loans and Treasury notes one
per cent, and apply it to the payment of these
expenses. Out of this the Secretary paid as
many clerks, &c., as he saw fit outside of
those provided for by law, without any restric-
tion on him by Congress, and for this purpose
he received the following sums, as shown by
his last report, which gives the amounts of
such loans, &c., annually :
Receipts from,
Year. loans and Trea-
Kury notes.
186 6 $712,851,553 05
1867   640,426,910 29

187 1   268,768,523 47
187 2  305,047,054 00
This fund, therefore, put into his hands out
of these loans:
1866  $7,128,515
186 7  6,404,269
186 8  6,251,114
186 9  2.386,780
187 0  2,854,744
187 1  2,687,685
187 2  3,050,470
Total $30,763,577
Therefore, leaving out all other amounts
collected from the people, and there are many
millions besides what I have stated, it is cer-
tain that our officials have, in the last seven
years, from the sources I have enumerated,
received the enormous sum of $3,402,536,452,
as follows:
From Customs $1,317,156,557
From internal revenue  1,676,778,194
Sales by War Department  135,414,687
Sales by Navy Department and transfers 111,890,812
Post Office collections  125,995,914
Patent Office collections  4,536,711
One percent, on loans, &o  30,763,577
Total $3.402,536,452
The Secretary of the Treasury in his last re-'
port, page 32, shows that the principal of the
debt of the United States on the 1st day of
July, 1865, was $2,680,647,869; and on the 1st
day of July, 1872, it was $2,253,251,328 ; paid
in the last seven years $427,396,541; which sum
deducted from the $3,402,536,452 shows that
$2,975,139,911, or the sum of $425,019,987
annually, has been spent for purposes other
than the payment of the public debt; and yet
gentlemen stand here and talk about economy,
reduction of expenditures, and honest admin-
istration. Before the war we had no internal
taxation, our only sources- of revenue were
from customs and the proceeds of sale of the
public lands. Of course there were Post Office
and Patent Office revenues, the latter very
limited in amount.
By reference to Young's Statistics on Cus-
toms Tariff Legislation, page 111, it will be
seen that the total amount received from cus-
toms from 1791 to 1861 was $1,535,530,140 ;
total proceeds of sale of public lands from
1791 to 1861, about $175,000,000â€”$1,710,-
530,140; or very little more than has been
collected by the interal revenue collectors
alone in the last seven years.
The people can thus understand if they will
why money is so scarce as to be worth two
Eer cent, a month, and may readily compre-
end the value of the oft-repeated assertions
of economy which they so often hear from the
Administration managers.
They cannot fail to observe that notwith-
standing the pronunciamentos of the great
reduction of taxation in the last few years,
they had to pay to the tax-gatherer last year
nearly $4,000,000 more than they paid in 1869.
But if they will look a little more closely they
will find that not less than fifty per cent., I
think one hundred per cent., should be added
to the amount which reached the Treasury
from tariff taxation, as the amount of indirect
taxation imposed on the people to support,
uphold, and protect favored monopolies. If
the smallest sum, say fifty per cent., is as-
sumed, it adds to the burdens of the tax-
payers $658,578,278, or makes $4,061,114,730
which they have been compelled to pay to their
governors, rulers, or masters, call them what
you will, in the last seven years.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Chairman, there seems to be a great misun-
