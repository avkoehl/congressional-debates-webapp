ately assumes all the distinctive phases of a
direct tax.
As conclusive evidence that the price of
cotton produced in this country is controlled
by the English market, I beg leave of the
House to print with my remarks statistical
tables prepared by Mr. Joseph S. Moore, of
the United States Statistical Bureau, showing
the price of cotton in New York and Liverpool,
and the movements of cotton in Liverpool and
London from 1843 to 1871-72 inclusive ;
Liverpool and London cotton movements from 184S to 1871-72, inclusive.

Who paid the cotton tax ?
The following table shows the price of cotton in Liverpool and in New York, with the equivalent in gold and currency in New York and tho margin in
Liverpool, during thirty-two months from 1866 to 1868, while the act imposing the tax on cotton was in force, and also for twer^ty-eixh t months in 1868,1869, and 18(0,
after the tax had been repealed. These figures plainly demonstrate that the price in Liverpool controlled the price in New Voi k absolutely, as well while the tax
was in force as after it had been removed; and, therefore, that the tax fell wholly and exclusively on the producer.
