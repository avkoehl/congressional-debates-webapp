Petersburg, February 5. - The enemy demonstrated heavily on our right to- day. Our pickets in General Gordon's front were driven in early this morning, and a portion of the enemy's force reached the Vaughan road and crossed Hatcher's Run. Some skirmishing has occurred, but there has been no engagement as yet. The object of this movement is not developed. The enemy's trains have been running incessantly for the last two nights, supposed to be conveying troops. From 7 to 11 o'clock last night the heaviest cannonade that has occurred for weeks took place on our left, caused by the enemy shelling our Chesterfield works. No casualties on our side.
