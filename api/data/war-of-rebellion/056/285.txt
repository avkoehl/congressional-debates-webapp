There is part of a cavalry regiment here at this time waiting for the colonel and residue of the regiment, subject to orders from here. Shall I send a gun-boat to Eastport, Miss., to order them down?

Very respectfully,

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding.

No forces in this district except one regiment, the Seventh Indiana Cavalry, which the Secretary of War has stationed under control of Governor O. P. Morton. Governor Morton is absent in New York City, but has been telegraph to know if he will send them.

Will telegraph you again as soon as he is heard from.

SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, November 30, 1863.

Maj. General U. S. GRANT:

There are only 100 troops in this district besides those necessary to guard prisoners of war, and the provost-marshal's department is using those to quiet disturbances at Manchester, Illinois I will send these as soon as circumstances permit.

Brig. General A. S. WILLIAMS,

Tullahoma:

The information seems reliable that about 1,000 rebel cavalry are at Salem, 20 miles southwest of Cowan, moving north, with an open country in their front and on their left. They will probably cross the railroad between Cowan and Estill Springs or go to the left through Fayetteville, or there cross the railroad above. They have neither artillery nor wagons; not a wheel in their column, and are moving very rapidly.

SAMUEL ROSS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel ROSS,

Stevenson:

Can you get information about Roddey to General Crook? Roddey ought to be caught.

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
