the road so thoroughly as to make it impossible for the enemy to repair it in months. No wagons or ambulances will go with the command, as it will follow along the line of the railroad, where there is no practicable wagon road. The men will carry their arms, and provisions in haversacks, and will work by details, one-half being on guard while the other half are at work. Particular care will be taken by commanding officers to keep their men from straggling. On reaching Chunky's Station the brigade will proceed directly to the point where our supply train is parked and remain with the train as guard until further orders, relieving Brigadier-General Chambers' brigade, now on that duty.

Very respectfully,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Meridian, Miss., February 15, 1864.

Brigadier General M. M. CROCKER,

Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: You will march with your entire command to-morrow morning to Enterprise, by the direct road, at 6.30 a.m. One regiment of cavalry railroad of cavalry will report to you starting and will be under your orders. As near as we can learn the direct road crosses the Oktibbeha Creek about 4 miles to the westward, and then keeps on the west side until within about 2 miles of the town, where it crosses to the east side of the stream and enters the place. On reaching this point you will remember the place, and if the enemy is not in force push your command in rapidly and send the cavalry, supported by a brigade of infantry, down to Quitman, or near that point to destroy a large railroad bridge across the Chickasawha River. Enterprise not being a place as purely military as this, you will keep your command under control and not permit any destruction of private property. The railroad and buildings connected with it will, however, be destroyed, the object being to damage the railroad as far as practicable and place it beyond the possibility of being repaired in months. On your march to Enterprise you will cause breaks to be made in the railroad whenever it can be done without detaining the advance of your column. Keep me advised frequently of anything important which you may learn.

Very respectfully,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
