events I shall take care of it so far as in me lies. As to the major-generalships in the Regular Army, I think I shall not dispose of another; at least until the combined operations now in progress, under direction of General Grant, and within which yourself and command are included, shall be terminated. Meanwhile, on behalf of yourself, officers, and men, please accept my hearty thanks for what you and they have so far done.

A. LINCOLN.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 18, 1864-8 p.m. (Received 7.15 a.m. 19th.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We have opposite us a larger force than we have, after keeping open our communications on the river. General Sheridan has left us with his force, via Jones' Bridge, across the Chickahominy, and New Kent Court-House, to join General Grant. Can we not have re-enforcements? We can hold on as we are if they cannot be spared.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

MAY 18, 1864.

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE:

Can you not put your guns on the right of our line, just this

side of Howlett's house, so as to get a fire on the enemy in case of an advance?

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

FIRST DIVISION SIGNAL STATION,

May 18, 1864.-4 p.m.

General BUTLER:

The enemy are working on intrenchments near Howlett's house, without our gun-boats disabling their men. They will mount guns to-night.

S. P. LEE.

MAY 18, 1864.

(Received 5.35 p.m.)

Generals BUTLER and GILLMORE:

Cannot the enemy be prevented from mounting guns at Howlett's to-night by a land attack?

LEE,

Admiral.
