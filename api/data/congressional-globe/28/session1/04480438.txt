These tables show tluit, of the vessels entered
from the Hanse Towns into t.lie United States in
1841, 99 were foreign, and 53 American; and of the
vessels departing from the United States to the
Hanse Towns, 137 were foreign, and only 45 Amer-
ican; that the value of merchandise exported from
the United States to the Hanseatic cities whs $3,-
188,346 in foreign vessels, and only §1,372,370 in
American vessels; and that, of the amount in value
of the imports into the United States, $2,151,377
was brought by foreign tonnage, and no more than
*4298,587 by American tonnage—being more than 7
to 1 against the United States.
The above shows our trade with only a few free
cities, inconsiderable in importance to the aggregate
of our commercial transactions with the different
nations of the earth; but, notwithstanding, it is a
striking illustration of the great advantages given to
foreigners over our own merchants in this branch of
business. So far, then, from protecting home in-
dustry, this system of taxation drives business
away from home, and bestows it upon other people
and other nations. I have it from good authority
that most of our ships, since 1828, have been sent
abroad to be coppered, and a large part of their
sails purchased in Europe. Thus has the mechanic
been deprived of employment in his business; and
p.e? ag well as the merchant, has seen the foreigner
posing a fair revenue duty upon such luxuries as
are now admitted free, than under any other rate
that can be fixed. The question is answered by
Pennsylvania and Maryland, in their demands for
Srotection upon their iron and coal mines. Yes,
Ir. Chairman, it is for protection—protection to the
few, to the injury of the many.
This goes beyond the shipping merchant, and in-
directly affects the farmer, the planter, and the me-
chanic., and all whose products seek a foreign mar-
ket.
The necessary increase of the rates of freight
caused by this tax upon ships enables the foreign
merchant to enter into a successful competition with
the American merchant, and share with him a trade,
under more advantageous circumstances, that by
right belongs, and should be preserved, to our own
citizens. Yet this is called protection to home in-
dustry—the true American system. Our commer-
cial relations with the Hanse Towns, as shown by
Mr. Webster in his Baltimore speech, is conclusive
upon this point. At that time, Mr. W. said "that,
from 1826 to 1830, five-sevenths of the arrivals in
Bremen from the United States were American ves-
sels, and two-sevenths Bremen; from 1831 to 1836,
three-sevenths American, and four-sevenths Bre-
men." I will submit his own tables and figures;
for, as they are but a transcript from the treasury
accounts, they are directly to the point, and show
conclusively the truth of the position I have taken:
Statement showing the amount of exports from the United
Stales to the Hansr T>wns in 1841, distinguishing the amount
exported in Jlmeritan and foreign vessels respectively, to-
gether with the number, tonnage. and national character of
each vessel,
made his successful rival. And this only to carry
out and sustain what is denominated the American
system.^ Where, I ask,.Mr. Chairman, without our
mechanics,, would have been our commercial ma-
rine? Where would have been our navy? Without
them, I ask, where would have been our country?
And yet, upon tliis very interest, and upon this class
of our fellow-citizens, than whom none are more
useful, intelligent, honest, or patriotic, is laid this
burden of taxation; and, as if to add insult to injury,
they are told by mouthing politicians that this is
the true American system. How much longer this
deception can be palmed off upon our intelligent
mechanics, and upon the people of this country, re-
mains to be seen. I trust the time is not distant
when this subterfuge of lies will be swept away.
I will now show from the report of the Committee
on Commerce, that our commercial interest is not
only exposed and injured by this system, but that
it stands in jeopardy of being broken down and de-
stroyed by the unequal operations uf this system, con-
nected with our liberal commercial treaties with
foreign governments:
Fi'om the report.
1st. The aggregate of imports from 1821 to 1830,
was - , - - - $700,600,000
The aggregage of exports - - 765,100,000
Giving as total value of cargoes, 1,561,700,000
^ Of these cargoes, about #1,410,560,000 were car-
ried in American vessels, which employed a ton-
nage of 25,000,000 of tons, showing a ratio of
about 80,500,000 cargo to 1,000,000 of tons; and
about 151,500,000 were earned in foreign vessels,
which employed a tonnage of 2,200,000 of tons,
giving a ratio of about 68,000,000 of cargo to
1,000,000 of tons.
1st. The aggregate of imports from 1831 to 1841,
was - §1,301,000,000
Do. exports (same period) - 1,091,800,000
Total value of cargoes - - 82,392,800,000
Of these cargoes, about 2,013,600,000 were car-
ried in American vessels, which employed a ton-
nage of 25,000,000 tons, and about 379,200,000 was
carried in foreign vessels which employed a tonnage
of 2,200,000 of tons. Although the ratio of carry-
ing done by the American vessels did not decrease
in the last period below the fust, yet it is shown
that the ratio of American tonnage has increased in
the last period over the first only 40 per cent., whilst
the foreign has increased 500 percent. And it, is
only because of the superiority of American built
ships over foreign, that we have sustained and kept
alive our commerce. Sir, American mechanics,
American skill, and American enterprise, have pre-
served what American legislation would otherwise
have destroyed.
I will here allude to one of the advantages of com-
merce, as connected with our national defencc. Our
commercial marine is the nursery for the seamen of
our navy; and every injury inflicted .upon the com-
merce of the country weakens our national defence.
Who does not know that our gallant little navy,
which, in the last war with Great Britain, so p-al-
l^ntly defended the stars and stripes against the lion
of the J^eas, was manned by seamen almost exclu-
sively from the commercial service? Sir, 1 will not
stop to recount their deeds of valor in their numer-
ous contents with vetcian foemcn. No, sir; 1 will
leave that for the hardy tar himself to do, as he tells
the story of "free trade and sailor's rights."
I ask, then, that all economists, all our retrench-
ment men, will come to the rescue, and aid in re-
lieving our commerce from this incubus, and place
it upon an equal fooling with the other interests of
the country.
Sir, there is one other point to which I would in-
vite the attention of the committee, and ask font a
careful consideration before they make up their
minds to vote against the bill now undu considera-
tion.
It is important for Congress, and particularly is it
important for the Atlantic cities, to give their atten-
tion to this point. Much of the trade of New "\ork,
Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, depends upon
the North and West. The great staples of the
northern and western States make up the mercantile
and commercial business of these cities. But what
do facts show to be the present state and condition
of that trade? Why, sir, by the colonial duties up-
on wheat, and the advantages given to the colonics
by Great Britain in their direct trade, a large por-
tion of the wheat, beef, pork, lard, flour, butter, and
cheese, are drawn off, and pass through the lakes to
Canada; so down the Welland canal, or the river St.
Lawrence, to England. Operations are silently go-
ing on, by "the construction of canals, and the im-
provements in the river St. Lawrence, that in a short
period of time will open a navigation to the lakes,
a,nd thence into the heart of the great West, where
British vessels of one thousand tons burden may
take in these products, and proceed directly to Eng-
land, or to her colonics, without the expense of trans-
shipment, and with the advantages of the colonial
duties to force trade in that direction. I will sub-
mit a few statistical facts, which I find upon this sub-
ject, and which may serve to establish this more
conclusively.
There passed through the Welland canal in five
years from J 837 to 1841, 4,901,738 bushels of wheat,
and during the same period 545,325 barrels of flour.
In 1837, but 208,242 bushels of wheat and 6,869
barrels of flour passed this canal; whilst in 1841,
(only five years after,) 1,579,966 bushels of wheat
and&13,4@3 barrels of flour passed tins same canal,
showing an increase of 1,371,724 bushels of wheat
in the last year over the first, and 106,614 barrels of
flour more in the latter than the former year.
Of pork and beef there were shipped in 1840,
15,624 bbls., and in 1841,30,416 bbls., showing an in-
crease of one hundred per cent, in a single year.
That these articles are exported from the United
States, is shown from the increased exports from
Gtuebec. In 1836 the exports from Quebec of flour
were 18,225 lbs., of wheat 9,716 bushels. In 1841,
354,101 lbs. of flour, and 562,862 bushels of wheat
were shipped from the same market. The above all
went to England, Ireland, the West Indies, and
New South Wales. I might enumerate many other
articles, such as lumber, including its various kinds,
tallow, hides, butter, cheese, corn, and cornmeal,
buckwheat, rye, and rye flour, spirit, shoes, leather,
iron-castings, and other manufactures of iron, the
annual amount of which articles in 1840, that were
sent through the Canadas to Great Britain and her
colonies, thereby giving the carrying trade to that
country, amounted to $5,895,966. Add to this the
wheat and flour as above specified, at one dollar per
bushel for the wheat, and five dollars per barrel for the
flour, and it will increase this amo.unt to $8,543,347.
This amount is of the specified articles, trie growth
and productions of the United States. Sir, the bill
reported by my colleague, [Mr. Phe(e\tix,] if it be-
comes a law, as! trust it may, will to some extent*
remedy this evil, by allowing the Canadians to im-
port through our Atlantic ports free of duty, and to
some extent would counteract the efforts of the
British government to force every thing through the
river St. Lawrence.
Suppose nothing is done here till the improve-
ments in the river St. Lawrence are completed, and
vessels of 1,000 tons burden are enabled to reach
any port on Lake Ontario without transhipment,
and brigs and schooners of 300 tuns burden from
any part of the world are enabled to reach Lake
Erie, and all the Western lakes without impediment,
it will then become a more difficult task to compete
for the Canadian trade. Sir, it will be a struggle to
retain our own.
Sir, the production of the old world will be
brought without transhipment to the very doors
of the western agriculturist for exchange. That im-
poita.nl and lucrative domestic tiade will soon be
turned into a foreign trade. The most valuable por-
tion of our countiy will, for all the purposes of trade
and commerce, he lost, forever lo> t, to the Atlantic
cities; and when too late, perhaps will be heard the
calls from that people upon Congress to prohibit, by
legislation, this unnatural diveision of our domestic
commerce. What will avail our raihoads and canals
of the East and North, and West, when the great
.staples of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, which
they moie particularly intended and weie construct-
ed to convey to the Atlantic cities, shall have
changed their direction, and are seen floating down
the St Lawrence, the Welland, and the Lachine
canals to a foreign market' These works of internal
improvement will become comparatively valueless.
Disaster must follow this system; and, when viewed
in its most favorable light, it must exhibit to every in-
telligent mind the sure rewards of a mistaken
policy.
Sir, another important subject, and one intimate-
ly connected with this, requires especially the atten-
tion of this Congress.
So long as cash duties are required, the capital
necessary at all times to meet the duties upon heavy
importations, must seriously embarrass the import--
