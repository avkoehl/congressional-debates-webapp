district colored schools.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I objected to the bill (H.
R. No. 3625) to amend an act entitled "Anaet
governing the colored schools of the District
of Columbia," in consequence of the absence
of the Senator from New Hampshire, the
chairman of the Committee on the District of
Columbia, who is now present and would like
to call it up.
Mr. PATTERSON. I should be very glad
to have the bill called up.
Mr. COOPER. I object.

public park at mackinac.
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 1304) to set apart a certain portion
of the island of Mackinac, in the straits of
Mackinac, within the State of Michigan, as |
a national park.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I object to that.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I ask the Sen-
ator who has made the objection to hear me
for one moment. I have not often claimed
the attention of the Senate. I should like to
state a few reasons why the bill should pass.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator from Rhode Island withdraw his ob-
jection ?
Mr. SPRAGUE. Yes, sir.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I ask that the
bill be read.
The Chief Clerk read the bill.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Is that a
proper bill to be passed under the rule upon
which we are now acting?
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I hope the
Senator from Maryland will listen to me for a
minute.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I renew my objection.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objec-
tion is renewed.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. I trust the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island will not persist in his
objection. I believe he will bear me out that
I have not occupied much of the time of the
Senate, and I desire to state briefly a few of
the reasons which I desire to present, showing
why this island should be dedicated for public
purposes.
Mr. SPRAGUE. It is evident that there
will be objection to the bill; its reading indi-
cates that there will be discussion ; and I trust
that the Senator from Michigan will find some
other opportunity to make his remarks. I
must insist on the objection.
Mr. FERRY, of Michigan. This bill has
been reported favorably by the Military Com-
mittee, and I hope the Senator will not per-
sist in bis objection. The Secretary of War
recommends it.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I call for the regular
order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sec-
retary will read the next bill on the Calendar.
district colored schools.
Mr. COOPER. I was mistaken in nay
objection to House bill No. 3625. I with-
draw it.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I ask that that bill be
taken up.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection to the proposition to take up the bill?
There being no objection, the bill (11
No. 3625) to amend an act entitled "Ai. ..et
governing the colored schools of the District
of Columbia" was considered as in Committee
of the Whole. It provides that the board of
trustees of schools for colored children in the
cities of Washington and Georgetown, District
of Columbia, shall consist of nine trustees,
seven of whom shall be citizens of Washington,
and two shall be citizens of Georgetown, who
shall be appointed by the Secretary of the
Interior.
The bill was reported from the Committee
on the District of Columbia with amendments.

strike out " Secretary of the Interior" and
insert " Governor of the District of Colum-
bia," wherever that phrase occurs in the bill.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section three,
line six, after the word " board," to insert the
words:
In accordance with the provisions of the acts of

of Washington and Georgetown.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was at the end of sec-
tion five, to insert the following additional
proviso:
And provided further, That the proportion of
school money now due, or that may become due, to
said board from the cities of Washington and
Georgetown shall be paid to the treasurer of said
board, and not to the trustees, as now provided.
The amendment was agreed to.

curred in.
