Generals RUNKLE, MANSON, and JUDAH:

Hobson dispatches from Jacktown-probably meaning Jacksonville-at 3.30 p. m. yesterday, that he has a brigade 3 miles in advance of that place; that Morgan is 15 miles in advance of him; that he (Hobson) is traveling 40 miles a day, men in good spirits, and will continue pursuit as long as possible. Dispatch from jackson reports Morgan at 7 p. m. encamped 13 miles west of that place. At 1.40 a. m. operator at Hamden says courier, just in from Jackson, reports Morgan entering that place as he left. Colonel Runkle was at Hamden at 1.30 to-night, and will endeavor to reach jackson with force of 2,000 or 3,000 militia. Judah reached Portsmouth at 5.30 p. m. yesterday, and has gone in direction of Oak Hill.

Commodore PENNOCK,

Commanding Squadron at Cairo, Ill.:

Captain FITCH,

Commanding Fleet, Pomeroy:

Some of his men were in Georgetown yesterday, and drove in the Ripley pickets, but would not attempt the town. I was in hopes that General Manson would, on his arrival at Maysville, move out on the road to Decatur, and intercept or force him on to the river at Ripley. I could have held him there for a week.
