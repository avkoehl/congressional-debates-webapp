CHERRY RUN, October 21, 1862-1.40 p. m.

Major-General NEWTON:

GENERAL: I have been down to Back Creek myself, and returned this moment. There is no enemy there. From the hill above I saw the railroad from the burnt bridge over Back Creek to Paxton's Cut, for a mile. There was not a person on it, or, apparently, at Paxton's Cut, to which I could see. Our pickets are at the bridge, burnt about a month since.

We probably could reach Paxton's Cut from the Maryland side with shells by some system of signaling, but there is nothing at which to aim. After leaving Paxton's Cut the road leaves the river, and could not be reached from this side. Shall I shell it, or wait for some signs of an enemy there?

Your obedient servant,

CHAS. DEVENS, JR.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 21, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN F. REYNOLDS, Sharpsburg:

General McClellan desires me to say that there has always been plenty of grain at Hagerstown, and there has always been plenty of both long and short forage at both Harper's Ferry and Frederick, and he desires to know what the difficulty is about getting forage for the artillery horses. If there is any difficulty about it, he will try to rectify it as soon as possible.

A. V. COLBURN,Assistant Adjutant-General.
