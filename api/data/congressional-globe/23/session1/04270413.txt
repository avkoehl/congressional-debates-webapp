1 he question then being on the motion of Mi
BEARDSLEY to stuke out the 23d and insert the
16 h—
Mi POLK rose to express the hope that the
motion would not prevail He did enteitam the
opinion that we ought not to fix upon an eailiei
day of adjournment than the 30 h of June, and the
day now proposed could not be fixed upon with
any piopnety in reference to the despatch of the
public business
Mr BOON hoped, he said, that the gentleman
from New York would withdraw the motion
Mr WILDE said, before he voted for the prop-
osition, he would ask the chairman of the Bank
Investigation Committee what time would be re-
quisite, according to his judgment, to bring the
business of which that committee had chaige to a
final close He was unwilling to givea vote which
looked to the suppression of an ample considera-
tion of that subject The íeasons which governed
him when he gave his views on this subject on a
former occasion, still existed He was then, and
sail was, desirous for fixing the carhestday for ad-
journment, if there was ro probability of any action
upon the great subjects oefore us He should not
have made these remarks but for the imputation
which had been thrown upon the minority of a
desire t9 protract the session unnecessarily and to
embarrass the public business He repeated that
he was in favoi of the earliest day which had been
named
Mr THOMAS, of Maryland, rose, he said, to
respond to the inquiry cheerfully and readily It
was not for him to prescribe a rule of action to
others in th s House But, without disrespect to
otheis,he might undertake to ansvvei the question
which had been propounded The Committee of
Investigation, he said, weie disposed to call up the
resoluti ins reported by them in good faith, and
with a since e,eai nest, and unequivocal determina
tion to cariythtm thiough Tne gentleman from
Geoigia could an lcipate as well as any one ti e
lengtn of time which a subject embracing so vide
a íange of topics would occupy So far as his own
opinion went, he must say that he thougn it
utterly impracticable to undertake to act upon the
questions involved in the bank report, together
with other business before the House, by the 16th
instant Theie were many appropnation bills to
be disposed of, in two ot which, the canal and
national ioad bill, his immediate constituents had
a great mteie¡>t Besides, theie was other indis
pensable business which would occupy the whole
time of the House pnoi to the day named It
would Le aUnost ridiculous to take up the subject
of the bank íepoit, and attempt to dispose of it,
if the House fi\ed the 16 h of June as the day of
adjournment He had hud some conversation with
his colleagues of the committee on thesubject, and
some of them concuned with him in the op nion
that if that day was fixed onf ir the day of adj mo-
ment, it ought to be consideied as an unequivocal
declaration by the House of a deteimmation not
to act upon the bank repoit It would be impos-
sible, in that case, to consider ihe subject, mless
all other business should be postponed ti'l the next
session He was bound to suppose that the ¡eso-
lutions would be adopted, and that would elicit
some discussion If they weie adopted, the meas
ures consequent upon it would occupy some time.
The fifth resolution  pioposed  to  authorze an
attachment against twelve oi fourteen individuals
who had renamed to testify, and committed other
contempts against the authonty of the House of
Repiesentatives It would perhaps take the mai-
shal or sergeant-at aims a week to execute the
piocess Could it be imigined, then, that the
House could dispose of so grave a subject in the
time limited by the resolution, and transact also
tne business before it tnat could not be postponed >
Every one of the membeis was as capable as he
was ofjudgmg how long the subject would be dis-
cussed 1 he repoit comes up on Tuesday next
He should, therefore, think if the House fixed
upon the 16 h instant foi the adjournment it ought
to be laid upon the table
Mi WlhE said he could not yet see land, and
he would not throw the lead until he saw the land
ahead He moved to lay the lesolution on the
table, which was negatived    Yeas 65, nays 146
Mr SPEIGHT was inclined (he said) to vote
for the 16th, out he was now in favoi of fixing upon
the 23d     He moved the previous question
Mr BE\RDSLEY withdiew the motion to in-
sert the 16ih, and said that he should certainly vote
for the previous question
Mr WILDE hoped the motion for the pi euous
question would be withdiawn, as we were «till in
the dark
The question being taken, the House refused to
second the previous question
Mr SPANGLER renewed the motion to strike
out 23 and insert 16th June
Mi WILDE hoped the motion would not pre
vail If, by fixingthe 23d, an oppoitumty would
be affoided to take up the íeportof the bank com-
mittee, he would vote against the 16th If it was
true, as gentlemen on one side supposed, that the
authority ot the House had been contemned by a
body of individuals, a just sense of duty and dig-
nity should pievent the House from adjourning,
bearing upon its chaiacter such a stain What
couit evei adjourned over to its next term with a
contemptuous witness unpunished, and the subject
uninvestigated' He was unwilling to adjourn until
the question was examined He was unwilling
that a giave question, affecting the honor of the
House, should be laid over If the gentleman
fiom Maryland [Mr TtoMAs] supposed that the
23d would afford the necessaiy time, he would
vote for that day, though he had intended to vote
foi the 16'h
Mi CROCKETT was very anxious that we
should fix on the 16 1), because the pioposition
had come fiom a quarter which was accustomed
to take responsibility He never believed gentle-
men to be in earnest in this bank report They
had proved it, and the proof was at hand Their
object was to get away and leave the question
open, in or lei to keep up an excitement
Mr CL 4.YTON understood the gentleman from
Maivland [Mi Tiioiw] to say, that if the 16th
was adopted, he should consider it an indication
that the House did not intend to constdei the re-
port of the committee of investigation Believing
it impoitant that the subject should be considered,
he had changed his opinion as to the time of ad-
journment, and moved a reconsideration of the vote
by which the Hi use íefustd to fix the 30th June
Mr L\TLL" felt bound to vote for the longest
day, b ith in reterence to the report of the com-
mittee, and other important business befoip the
House He did not believe it practicable to ad-
journ at eithei of the periods which had been pro-
posed Woik had been cutout wtnch would last
beyond all of them He v/as for meeting the
questions presented by the report of the commit-
tee, and hoped no one of the party with whom he
usually acted would obstiuct it He alluded to
the cucums'ance that distinguished gentlemen in
ti e other House at one time expressed the opinion
that Congiess ought not to adjourn even if the
present session was run into ihe next B it as
soon as a committee of the House was sent to in-
vestigate the sfFaiis of the bank, their tone was
entiHy changed, and they declaied themselvesm
favor ofan ea 1 a Ijoarnment lie had obseived,
both in Congress a id m cei tarn preses th-oughout
ihe Ur> T, a similar change of tone Theie was
an eudent disposition to shrink fiom the question
He was satisfied that an early adjournment was
inconsistent wun the inquiiy which the state of
that institution requued
Mr R M JOHNSON was in favor of the 16ih,
but would vote for the 23 J, because it seemed to
be the prevailing opinion that the session should
beso fai prolonged Should Congiess remain here
through June and July, be would hazard the
opinion that few impoitant measures would be
concluded He had been heie twenty seven years,
and never yet saw a Congress which would give
up talking, and go to work before the day of
adjournment was fixed We knew very well that
nothing would be agreed on íelativeto the gieat
subject befoie the House.
Mi CHILTON, in teply to the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr Lytle,] denied that he, for one, was
disposed to skulk from any examination into the
ailaiis of the bank He had voted against the
lesolution ordeung the investigation, because he
thought the country would derive no benefit fiom
it If we now entered upon that subject, it would
occupy the whole summer, and no piactical good
would result fiom it He was disposed to settle
the whole matter by adjourning as soon as the
appropriation bills were passed
Mr BURGCS, so far from shunkmg from the
bank question, said he would stay heie till the
snow fell, ra'hei than offer any obstacle to its con-
sideration If gentlemen wished to bring the
bankeis heie, his voice should not be lifted against
it He would make no speeches on the one side
or the other, and would do nothing which should
obstruct ti eir wishes. The question before the
House was, shall we give time to tne committee
to arraign the president and directors of the bank >
His reply to the question was yes, though there
was not a man m the House moie anxious to get
home than himself. He hoped every gentleman
who wished to aflord the committee an opportu-
nity to biing up the subject, would vote for the
reconsideration
Mi LINE said he had given several silent
votes upon tne subject of the adjournment of the
session That it was not his intention to detain
the House by sa\ ing anything that shall invite a
reply, oi add to the present excitement On the
con trai y, he would desire to allay evei y unpleasant
feeling, and banish from the Hall all paity spirit—
all thoughts of who should or should not heieafter
fill high places
Mi Speaker, as yet we have done but little,
whi'e all the important bills in which the public
interest is concerned, i emam to be disposed of He
did not believe gentlemen would be disposed to
destroy the important business of the House A
different feeling seems no w to be manifested by all.
Sir, from the various important bills referred to
by several honorable gentlemen, it is evident that
the 23d of June will be too limited to accomplish
that which all admit to be of public and private
importance
Theie is, however, one bill upon the files, regu-
lating the deposites of the public money, (said Mr.
L ,) he would never agree by his vote to adjourn
until finally acted upon However great his con-
fidence in the Secretary of the Treasury, and un-
bounded m the Executive, evei y consideration of
public duty demanded it As we regard ourselves
and íespect the wishes of our constituents, and the
leputations of those individuals, anil the honoi of
the country, we will dispose of this, delicate and
i all exciting subject It is called for as we regard
I the public fears,to restóte pubheand private con-,
fidenee, and to leheve.asfar as possible, the public
embanassment
The objection made by the gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr Chilton] is not a sound one, tnat, if
we pass tne bill, it will fail in ti e other House.
However exceptionable the bu! m its present form
to the notions of that honorable gentleman, hkeall
others, it may be iHeied and amended, until it
might even fill the wishes of the gentleman him-
self The other branch, m theii wisdom, will also
! be at liberty to mould it to then sense of propnety
anil duty
Mr Speaker, my honorable friend fiom Ken-
tucky [Mi iohnsom] says, twenty seven yeais'
expeuence has taught him that this House will
never do anything until the day of adjournment is
fixed Granted, but does that prove that a rea-
sonable time ought not to be given between the
time of fixing and the day of adjournment' And
that in doing this, we ought not to be influenced
by the business to be transacted >
