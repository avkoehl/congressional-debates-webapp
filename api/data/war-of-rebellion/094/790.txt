Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Second indorsement.]

SECRETARY OF WAR:

On each occasion when this officer has been sent with his command to distant service, serious calamity to Alabama has followed. It is desirable to know what disposition General Beauregard proposes to make of this force.

JANUARY 18, 1865.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Inquire of General B. the purpose for which General Roddey's brigade is wanted. Twice his removal has been followed by unfortunate results, and hence some hesitation is felt in authorizing change of locality.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

[Fourth indorsement.]

File with original. See telegram to General Beauregard, January 19, 1865.

J. W. R.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TUPELO, MISS., January 17, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT,

Chief of Staff, Montgomery, Ala.:

Order General Smith to inspect works at Choctaw and Oven Bluffs, and give such orders as may be necessary for defense of river at those points. Obstructions and torpedoes recommended for Tennessee River must be must there.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

MERIDIAN, MISS., January 17, 1865.

Colonel E. J. HARVIE,

Inspector-General:

SIR: I think I can send from 2,000 to 2,500 men per day via Selma. It would be safe policy only to have the transportation given to this point, and then all the men I cannot send via Selma can send on via Mobile. Will do everything possible to forward the men rapidly, and have the troops forwarded without delay.

Yours, respectfully,

GEORGE WHITFIELD,

Major and Quartermaster.
