house and adjacent out-buildings. A few moments later the One hundred and fourteenth fell to the rear, and the Fifty-seventh very soon followed, leaving my left flank entirely unprotected. The enemy, taking advantage of this, advanced across the Emmitsburg road, in front of the house, and immediately opened fire upon our left flank. Seeing this, I ordered my regiment to retire slowly a short distance, and changed front to the rear on the first company. A small remnant of the Fifty-seventh Pennsylvania volunteers rallied with us, and formed line along the by-road before mentioned, where we again opened fire, and checked the advancing rebels for a few minutes; but the regiment being so small and both flanks being entirely unprotected, I ordered the regiment to retire slowly, and formed line again a short distance to the rear. The troops in our rear by this time were beginning to be effective, and the brigade having gone to the rear, I formed with these troops, and fought with them, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, but do not know whose troops they were. Soon after, I saw General Humphreys, and formed line with some of his troops. From this point we advanced steadily until we had regained nearly all the ground we had lost. Noticing at this time three pieces of artillery that had been abandoned by our artillerists and turned upon us by the advancing rebels (and who were in turn compelled to abandon them), I sent forward my few remaining men to bring them off the field, but being unable to bring them all off, I got assistance from some men of the Excelsior Brigade with two of the pieces, and brought the third off the field with my own men. I withdrew all my men with this piece, and finally delivered it to Sergt. Daniel A. Whitesell, Battery C, Fifth U. A. Artillery, who identified it as one of the pieces belonging to that battery. About this time, Captain [Timothy L.] Maynard, of General Graham's staff, came up. I reported to him for orders from General Graham, and was informed that the corps was forming at a certain point. I moved the regiment, but could not find the brigade (it was now quite dark), but formed on the right of the Third Brigade. Soon after, I moved under the direction of Lieutenants Benson and [George W.] Perkins, of General Graham's staff, and joined the brigade, and bivouacked for the night. The next morning, July 3, we again moved forward with the brigade, and occupied a position in the third line of battle and in the rear of the Fifth Corps, where we remained until about 2 p. m., when we were again ordered with the brigade to the center, our forces there having been attacked, and formed line of battle in the rear of the batteries at that point. We remained in this position until 9 p. m., when the regiment with the brigade moved to the front and formed line of battle on the first line, relieving the Vermont Brigade, of the First Corps. We remained in this position during the night. In the morning, the line was withdrawn and the troops occupying it marched a short distance to the rear. The entire rebel front line had also retired. Several unimportant movements took place during the day, but nothing worthy of note. The entire loss in the regiment during this time was 1 officer killed, 13 officers wounded, 7 enlisted men killed, 101 enlisted men wounded, and 9 enlisted men missing, making a total of 131 men.
