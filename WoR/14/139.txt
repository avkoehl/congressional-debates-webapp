Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have made inquires since my dispatch of this a.m. The quartermaster at this posts has no horses or trains to spare from the Potomac Army. Major-General McClellan has called on me to place two regiments at Stony Creek Court-House, or Lee's Mill, to protect his rear for the time being. I have deemed proper to give you this information, in order that you may perfectly understand the position of General McClellan.

McCLELLAN'S HEADQUARTERS, May 5, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Raining hard now and most of the night; roads consequently infamous. Enemy still at Williamsburg. Heavy firing now going on. The weather has delayed Franklin to-day. Hope to overcome all obstacles yet and throw a sufficient force up the York to cut the enemy's line of retreat. Several of our batteries are actually stuck fast in the mud. The men have done all that could be done. No sings of cessation of rain.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

General E. V. SUMNER:

The general commanding directs that you occupy Lee's Mill at once, and push forward a reconnaissance with cavalry, two brigades of infantry, and three batteries on the road toward Grove's Wharf and the Half-way House, having the roads and bridges put in order as rapidly as possible. Send the cavalry on in the direction of Grove's Wharf, until they ascertain where the enemy is, and the infantry and artillery
