HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,May 29, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel CROSBY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I received directions about seeing to a brigade that was ordered on Saturday to encamp at the Half-Way House. That brigade went into camp Saturday, and I am informed that another brigade arrived and encamped soon the same ground last night, but have had no orders in regard to it, nor have I given any. But there will be a difficulty in getting water there for so many. The railroad cannot be used for this purpose, and the instance to haul is about three miles. Would it not be better for one of these brigades to encamp at Carrollton?

Very respectfully,

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Respectfully returned.

The troops now encamped at the Metairie Ridge will probably leave too-morrow a. m. for Red River, and it will not be necessary to move the Second Brigade too Carrollton for so short a time as they are too remain.

By command:

J. SCHUYLER CROSBY,
