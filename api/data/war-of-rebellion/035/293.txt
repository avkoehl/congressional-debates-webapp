Green River or at Columbia, it will be better to march across. At any rate, get them there at the earliest possible moment. Their transportation can go with them.

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

Tell Carter to use his discretion. If he can cross with safety and whip the enemy, let him do it. I hope to hear from Boyle, as to Jacob's movements at Greasy Creek, very soon, and will transmit dispatch to you. Colonel Graham is at Tompkinsville, with outposts at Bennett's Ferry, Celina, Burkesville, and other crossings on the river. He had been skirmishing yesterday and to-day, with results in his favor. Morgan and Wheeler are at or near Gainesborough. You can send a mounted force, as you desire, to Williamsburg, if you can do so without interfering with Carter's movements. I have directed a telegraph office to be opened at London.

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, April 29, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

You can let the Twenty-fourth Kentucky remain where it is, and order the Tenth Kentucky Cavalry to Owingsville, one battalion of the Fourteenth to Mount Sterling, one battalion to Irvine, and one battalion to a point on the Kentucky opposite Proctor. Please make these movements as quickly as possible, so that the Ninth Corps can be put inn motion at once. The New Jersey, regiment with Carter can be marched across from Somerset to Columbia when Carter getss through with it, and have its transportation join it. It is important that the Ninth Corps should get to Columbia, with a view to moving to Glasgow or Tompkinsville as early as possible. If any portion, or the whole of it, can be sent to Nicholasville, Lexington, or Lebanon, to take cars to Cave City, let it be done if it will expedite the movement. The wagons can go across the country with proper guards. I am inclined to think it will be better for the whole corps to march. Let no time be lost.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, April 29, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Lexington:

I want the Ninth Corps concentrated at Columbia, with a view to moving to Tompkinsville or Glasgow, except the Second Maryland, which will remain at or in the neighborhood of Frankfort. You have facilities for learning the nature of the roads, and you will please send a plan for the movement as early as possible. I would propose that the main body move via Stanford, Middleburg, and Liberty. It may be advisable, however, to move them by way of Lebanon. Where are Sturgis' headquarters? Order all the troops to be ready to make the movement at once. I will give definite orders as soon as I hear from you. Send the Twenty-fourth Kentucky to Mount Sterling, and Fourteenth Kentucky to Irvine.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.
