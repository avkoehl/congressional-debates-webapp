Ehenezer Hutchison and others, commissioners
underaresolutiOn passed by the Legislature of the
State on the 19th of April, 1854, and the plan of
surveys accompanying the reports, and of record
in the land office of the State; and provided, aiso,
that it shall appear, to the satisfaction of the land
a^ent of Maine, that such deeds of release do ef-
fectually convey a  ood title to the landn,except
so far as the titles have been affected by Un« oper-
ation of the treaty; and provided further, that if

■ and lost to the proprietors m consequence of the
diplomatic arrangement entered into between the
, United States and Great Britain,in 1832, by which
| both parties agreed to abstain from the exercise
of jurisdiction m the terntorv.
j Ur. WAWMiiUR^, of Maine. The House
j will perceive thai the resolution does not propose
i to put the biil on its passage, but merely^sks to
; have a day set apart for its consideration. It is
' a bill which is necessary to carry out the treaty
of Washington. I think there can be no objec-
tion to having it considered. I call for tellers on
the suspension of the rules.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Boyce and
Chaffee were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes 96, noes 52.
So (two thirds not voting in favor thereof) the
rules were not suspended.
HOUR OF MEETING.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. I move that on
to-morrow,arid until otherwise ordered, the daily
hour of meeting shall be eleven o'clock, a. m. If
objection be made, I will move to suspend the
rules.
Mr. McGlUEEN. I object.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I put the question
to the Chair, whether it be neccssary to move to
suspend the rules for the motion? The daily
hour of meeting is fixed by order of the House.
It was fixed, at the commencement of this session,
! attwelve o'clock,until otherwise ordered. Now,
I think it does not require a suspension of the
rules to get at that question.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it does.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. That has been
the invariable ruling. I move to suspend the
rules.
The rules were suspended; there being, on a
division—ayes 114, noes 48.
Mr. P1IELPS, of Missouri. I now submit the
resolution that on to-moirow, and until otherwise
ordered, the daily hour of meeting of the House
shall be eleven o'clock, a. m.
Mr. McaUEEX. 1 would say to the gentle-
man from Missouri that there are committees who
are to meeton importantbusmess atclevcn o'clock
to-morrow*. 1 know that that is the case in re-
gal d to my own committee—the Committee on
Public Lands.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. Well, I will give
one day's notice, and make the order apply on and
after Wednesday next, until otherwise ordered,
j 1 now move the previous question.
! The pievious question was seconded, and the
! mam question ordered; and, under its operation,
the resolution was adopted.
THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
Mr. IvlLGORE. I ask the unanimous consent
j of the House to oiler the following preamble and
I resolutions:
I \VlK>rea-> the laws piolulmmg the African slave trade

Mr. BURNETT. I would like to ask the gen-
tleman from Indiana a question.
[Calls to oider.]
Mr. BURNETT. I cannot vote for the reso-
lutions; if for no other reason, because I do not
think that the preamble recites facts. I would
like the gentleman to tell this House and the
country who it is, that is here, urging the repeat
of the laws forbidding the slave trade'
The SPEAKER. Discussion is objected to.
Mr. LiURNETT. Well, I objcct to the reso-
lutions.
Mr. KILGORE. T move to suppriirl the rules,
so as to enable me to introduce the resolutions.
