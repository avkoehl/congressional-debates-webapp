Now, deducting from the wholeamountspent
in the year ending June 30, 1869, the amount
spentin the eight months of Johnson's admin-
istration, it will leave expended by General
Grant's administration, from March 1 to July
1,1869, four months, $85,000,000. Estimating
the expenses of the rest of the year at the
same ratio of expenses as Grant's four months,
would make the expenses for the first year of
General Grant's administration $1255,0(10,000
against $370,000,000 of the last year of An-
drew Johnson. Taking the actual expenditures
fortheyear ending June 30,1800, $314,000,000,
and deducting therefrom the expenses upon
the basis of the actual expenditures of Gen-
eral Grant's administration from March 1 to
July 1, there would have been a saving of
$58,000,000. Add to the actual expenses of
the eight months of Johnson's administration
expenses at the samp rate as he was making if
he had gone on through the year and it would
have amounted to $343,000,000. Take the
actual saving, deducting what the actual ex-
penses were of Grant's administration, and it
shows a saving for four months of $20,000,000.
Suppose the same rate of saving could be
made for twelve months, three times that
amount, or $87,000,000, wouldhavebeen saved
if General Grant's administration had gov-
erned the expenditures for nine months in-
stead of for three only, for the year ending last
July. Or, in other words, Mr. MoCullooh's
expenditures were at the rate of $>343,000,000
a year, Mr. Boutwell's expenditures at the
rate of $255,000,000 a year, or a saving of
$87,400,000. So that if Andrew Johnson had
managed the affairs of the nation at the same
rate of expenditure from June, 1809, to June,
1870, that he made during the last nine months
of his Administration he would have expended
$343,000,000, while $283,000,000 only were ap-
propriated, leaving a deficiency of $60,000,000
over the appropriation ; and at the rate at
which Mr. Boutwell carried on the affairs of
the Treasury, expending $250,000,000 only,
would have made a saving below the appropri-
ation of nearly twenty-eight million dollars.
Now, these figures upon the face of them
would show a result which might be claimed
in favor of our Administration with a groat
deal more justice than any claim made by the
learned chairman upon the estimate book
against us, and without thorough investiga-
tion would have a tendency to deceive and do
injustice to the honesty and economy of even
Andrew Johnson's administration, which God
forbid! And the wrong, which is a latent one, is
in this: that because of the different parts of
the year in which the interest on the public
debt becomes due a very large error is made
in the above table against Andrew Johnson's
administration, and it should be corrected
thus: take the total expenditure from July 1',
1868, to March 1, 1869, $228,753,223 ; deduct
interest actually paid in that time, $98,701,927,
and you have the net expenses for eight
month?, $130,051,296. _ Add expenses of An-
drew Johnson's administration at the same
rate, and you have the annual expenditure,
$195,076,944.
On the other hand, take the expenditures
of Grant's administration from March 1 to
July 1, $85,237,371 ; deduct interest actually
paid during that time, $31,992,315, and you
have the net expenses for four months,
$53,245,056. Add at the same rate the expend-
itures of the Remaining eight months under
Grant and you have $106,490,112, or an an-
nual expense under Grant's administration,
not reckoning tUfe interest on the public debt,
which is apermanentamount—that which is due
on the bonds owned by the Government being
paid into the sinking fund—of $159,735,168,
or an actual saving under Grant, found by sub-
tracting that amount from the $195,000,000,
under Johnson of $35,341,776 annually. And
I have also taken into account in this calcula-
tion $13,500,000 of pensions which became due
on the 4th of March, 1869, of which $5,700,000
were paid before and $7,800,000 paid subse-
quent to that date, about equalizing the pay-
ments of pensions during the periods; so that
that item will make no difference. So that
bringing it to the exact test of actual figures,
with all proper deductions, without the interest
on public debt, the actual monthly expendi-
tures of Johnson's administration during its
eight months was $16,256,412, and under the
present Administration $13,311,264, showing a
monthly gain in favor of the present Adminis-
tration of $2,945,148, or nearly eighteen per
cent., saving thereby the enormous sum of
$35,341,776 annually.
Now these figures were as open to the chair-
man of the Committee on Appropriations as
to myself, and I challenge him to dispute one
of them. I again reiterate the complaint—not
mine, but that of the Republican party of the
country—why did he not compare, if he wa3 a
friend of -the Administration, the expenditures
of that Administration with the expenditures
of the administration of Andrew Johnson?
Why compare the estimates only of Andrew
Johnson with the estimates of possible appro-
priations of Congress, when he had before
him the authoritative report of the Secretary
of the Treasury, showing him wrong by more
than forty millions ?
But what I do most sincerely further com-
plain of, and what the Republican party have
a right to complain of in my colleague, is that,
standing in the place he does, by not investi-
gating the facts, by not calling at the source
to get the explanations which I have given, he
has given the false impression to the country
that the pledges of economy with which this
Administration came in are not carried out in
fact and are not to be carried out by them,
and has thus given a vantage to his enemies,
their enemies, and the enemies of the country
by which to wrest the power frQm those who
have carried the country through the war and
place it in the hands of those who sought or
would permit its destruction by the war.
" What private griefs ho had, alas! I know not,
That made him do it; for lie is an honorable man."
We all had and have the highest confidence
in his integrity ; we had—must I speak of it in
the past?—'-in his accuracy and his judgment.
1 have been endeavoring in my own mind to
account for my colleague's action in thisbehalf,
and have come to the conclusion that this is
the explanation that he is by the constitution
of his mind conservative, and radical only
because of his location. He dislikes to take
any step forward. Recommending an appro-
priation.^ for these many millions which the
necessities of a great nation and a great peo-
ple require to. be expended seems to him a
step in advance from which he shrinks. Like
the elephant passing over a bridge, he starts
back and refuses to trust the planks. Bat
unlike the elephant, after he tries the flooring
and ascertains its strength he does not pass
over in safety. The same conservative tend-
ency has bound down my colleague through-
out his career, or there would have been no
position to which he might not have been
called. I have watched him with interest day
by day during the crises and struggles of
the last ten years, and have always seen him
held by conservatism as by bands of new
withes. When the thirteenth amendment was
pending before this House to emancipate four
million bondsmen his conservatism held him
from raising his voice in its advocacy, although
it passed Congress by a single vote and needed
his great power in its aid. When the fourteenth
amendment, which secured to freedom and
loyalty the results of the war, was before Con-
