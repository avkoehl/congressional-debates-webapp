WASHINGTON, D. C., August 12, 1862.

Major-General POPE,

Cedar Mountain, Va.:

It has just been suggested that, under existing circumstances, you should remove your rolling stock this side of the Rappahannock and keep the bridge strongly guarded. General Burnside will move to-day to re-enforce you. He could not move sooner for want of transportation. General Wool will not be responsible for Winchester if your brigade is withdrawn. I am doing everything in my power to hasten McClellan's movements.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Cedar Mountain, August 12, 1862-6 p. m.

H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The enemy has retreated to Gordonsville, blowing up the bridges on the common roads. Our cavalry and artillery pursued as far as Orange Court-House. I shall move forward on Louisa Court-House as soon as Burnside arrives. Do I understand that he takes the chief command when he joins? I will send detailed report to-morrow.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Va.:

Retain what forces may be required to protect the bridge of the Rappahannock and the landing at Aquia, and send the remainder to Pope's assistance by the road north of the Rapidan. If General McClellan should not re-enforce you in time, and you are compelled to retreat, fall back on Alexandria. Keep me advised of any re-enforcements arriving. The horses and wagons are intended partly for you and partly for the re-enforcements from McClellan.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
