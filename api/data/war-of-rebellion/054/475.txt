to entertain the charges, and ordered General Law to be restored to duty."

The "authorities at Richmond" are aware that it is my opinion that our failures at Lookout Mountain on the 29th of October, and at Campbell's Station on the 16th of November last, were due to a want of conduct upon the part of Brigadier-General Law. In addition to this, charges of a very grave character have been preferred against General Law, which, if established, must dismiss him from the service. If my efforts to maintain discipline, spirit, and zeal in the discharge of official duty are to be set aside by the return of General Law and his restoration to duty without trial, it cannot be well for me to remain in command. I cannot yield the authority of my position so long as I am responsible for the proper discharge of its functions. It is necessary, therefore, that General Law should be brought to trial upon the charges that have been preferred against him, or that I be relieved from duty in the Confederate States service. I have ordered the rearrest of General Law upon his return.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
