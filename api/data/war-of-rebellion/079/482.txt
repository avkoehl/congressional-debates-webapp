HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,October 28, 1864-5. 20 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

GENERAL: General Garrard says it is about five miles from here to the Alabama road by the trail upon which we are now traveling. Citizens confirm this. I crossed the Alabama road at point where it crosses Cowan's Creek. From all I can learn you will save a good deal by sending your train up the Jacksonville road to the Alabama road, and pursuing that route. At best you won't make much. The infantry can go through this way. I shall go back by Cedar Bluff and push on to Rome.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
