General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

The copy of your letter to General Donelson, dated 17th, received. A cavalry expedition into Kentucky, of which General Marshall's cavalry was part, had moved previously by my order. If the Department will give me timely notice when it intends to exercise my command, I shall be able to avoid such interference with its orders.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, March 27, 1863.

General D. S. DONELSON, Knoxville, Tenn.:

Grave complaints are made by Governor Vance and others of the presence and depredations of marauding deserters and refugees lurking in the mountains of North Carolina, near Asheville, and in the neighboring mountainous districts. Send, if you can, an efficient detachment to sweep the country of such bands, conscripting all of proper age. I will write to Governor Vance, asking him to co-operate.+

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

TULLAHOMA, March 28, 1863.

Mr. PRESIDENT:

I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 20th, and with it a copy of your telegram of the 16th. I fear that my reply to the latter did not express my meaning, from my anxiety to be brief.
