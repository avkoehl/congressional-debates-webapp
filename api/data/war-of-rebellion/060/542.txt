HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPT.,February 9, 1864.

Major- General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following report has just been received, and is respectfully forwarded;

PONY MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION,

February 9, 1864- 5 p. m.

Captain NORTON:

The enemy occupy their old camps along the river, but I see no new ones whatever. The pickets have been strengthened at the fords. In the vicinity of Walker's Springs a smoke has been visible to- day, and also at a point 10 miles south of there, on the Madison and Gordonsville pike. I judge the former camp smoke, and the latter burning brush. At north base of Fox Mountain a smoke has been seen this p. m., also like brush- burning.

PAINE,

Signal Officer.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. B. NORTON,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac.
