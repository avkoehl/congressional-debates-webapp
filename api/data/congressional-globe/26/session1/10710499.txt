Aggregate        Aggregate
amount   un-     amount of re-
der the tariff    duced duties
of 1832, &c.     under    van-
for the same     ous  acts for
yeais.               same years.
Now let us notice some of the results presented
by this table. T-he whole amount of levenue re-
ceived by the General Government from custom*,
from 1789to 1838 inclusive, was $710,285,875 22,
ot which was received, ttom
1825 to 1828, Adams'* term,         $36,457,852 15
1829 to 1832, Jackson's first term,   97,294,606 31
1832to 183(5, Jackson's second term, 88,048,717 18
In the years 1837 and '38, the first
two years of Van Bu ren's term,    27,328,090 75
It further appeared, from what he had read,
that  there was   reduced, from   1830   to   1838,
$170,539,329 29, of which $11,218,708 18 was
reduced trom 1830 to 1832, and $105,910,925 15
fiom 1833 to 1836; and notwithstanding this very
large reduction, the receipts daring the latter pe-
riod were a million and a half larger than they
were from 1825 to 1828.     It further appears from
this table, that under the operation of the various
acts of Congress to which he had referred, regulat-
ing   the  tariff   of  duties,   that   the   reductions
continued   to   increase,   as   they   amounted   to
$53,409,685 86 m the year  1837 and  1838, the
first two of Mr. Van Buren's administration; and
that there has been a considerable lalhng off in the
receipt*!, as in these two years they amounted to
$27,328,090 75 only; and that a large proportion
of this reduction has fallen on articles which are
the necessaries of life, and which we either drink
or wear.   By another table, also prepared under
the direction of the Secretary, and more in detail,
it appeared that, in the years 1834 to  1838 inclu-
sive, the following amounts were reduced on the
articles enumerated:

Now on these ten articles alone, either used in
our families or on our plantations and farms, there
has been an aggregate reduction, in the five years,
of #96,604,721 14.
These are astonishing results, and yet they were
produced by following the only safe rule which
you can adopt in the investigation of this subject,
and that is, te estimate the duties under the act of
1828, had it not been repealed or modified on the
amount of the actaal imports into the country. It
is due, however, to candor, to state that, m his opi-
nion, the importations would not have been as
.heavy as they have been, had the act of 1828 con-
tinued in force, as the high duties imposed by it
upon some articles would have checked their con-
sumption, and the yet higher duties upon others
would, perhaps, have prohibited their importation
altogether. Onerous and oppressive as some of the
duties were under that act, they could not have
kept down the energies of our people, and there
would have been, under their operation, a gradual
increase in the importations and the receipts from
them. This is proved by our past history. With-
out going farther back, let us see what was the ef-
fect of the act of 1828 upon the revenue, even
while in full force. In 1827, the payments into
the Treasury from customs were $19,712,283 29,
somewhat less than they had been in the previous
year, probably in some measure owing to the dis-
cussions concerning the tariff, and the doubts en-
tertained by the commercial classes as to what
action Congress would take upon it. In the next
year, among other causes, there being a general
expectation that the tariff would be modified, the
importations were heavier than they had been, to
avoid the higher duties which it was believed
would be laid; and hence the payments rose to
$23,205,523 64. In 1829 and '¿0, there was an
inconsiderable falling off from the effects of the for-
mer stimulus, and the receipts of the latter year
being slightly affected by the modification which
the act of 1828 had undergone concerning coffee,
cocoa, and molasses. In 1831 they reCD/erecI; anc*
notwithstanding the large reductions made in tnilt
year and iu 1832, they continued to improve,
until, in 1833, they had swollen to $29,032,318 91.
It would be easy to show that the same results bad
either preceded or lollowed the passage ©f the act
of 1824, but it is deemed unnecessary. It will be
vain for gentlemen to deny, that had not these re-
ductions been made, the receipts would have been
greater; and the expenditures, therefore, must ne-
cessarily have been many millions, annually, larger
than they have actually been.
For what purpose were the duties on a number
of anieles itici eased by the act of 1828? The ob-
ject avowed, to be sure, was a double one—to raise
revenue, and to protect the domestic md stry of
the country. Whatever it may have been, the ef-
fect, so far as it respects the extent of the burdens
which it imposed upon the people, was precisely
the same, with the aggravation, that if the addi-
tional duties were levied exclusively for the benefit
of manufactures, the difference would have enured
to that intertst, and not to the common Treasury
of the country. In a speech dfiivered in the Se-
nate by Mr. Clay, February 25 h, 1637, with
boldness which characterizes him, he says "ihat
the great question so long agitated between diffe-
rent portions of the Union, has not been whether,
in laying a bill for revenue, the Government may
not levy a duty which gives incidental protection to
the industry of our own citizens—for this none will
d;ny—but whether such protection is in itself a proper
and legitimate olject for which taxes may be laid.
The friends of the protective policy have always
maintained the latter proposition." In taking off the
duties, whether laid for the purpose of putting
money into the Treasury or in the pockets of the
manufacturers, the people must have been re-
lieved. He would not pause to inquire whe-
ther the duties were paid by the producers of our
exports, or the producers of the imports received
in exchange for them, or the consumers of the
latter. These, and various other questions of politi-
cal economy connected with the tariff, he would
pass by. It is sufficient for his purpose that they
were taxes in some form, and paid by somebody.
Mr. Adams, in his report from the Committee on
Manufactures, on the 25th May, 1832, says:
"The payment of a large national debt is a novelty in the
history of nations; a remission of a large amount of taxes for
that cause, is equally unprecented."
Again:
"The Committee on Manufactures are aware that the remis-
sion of taxes must, in us nature, be a measure always accepta-
ble to the people; nor are they, as servants of the people, in-
sensible of the gratification with which every member of
the present Congress may share in such a measure at this
time. They feel the delight with which every one permitted to
enjoy the luxuries of assenting to such a remission in the be-
nevolence of his disposition, and they understand the power of
an eloquent and animated appeal to the legislative authority to
leave all moneys not absolutely indispensable for the public
expenditure mlhe pockets of the people. The committee per-
ceive also, upon so singular an occurrence as that which ad-
mits of the remission of taxes to a considerable amount, such
as in the present case, the question arises to what extent the re-
duction shall be sanctioned, the desire of increasing that amount
may be more intense in the mind of one member than in that
of another. When all are to share in the credit of the remis-
sion, the distinctive merit to the aspirant for popular favor will
belong to him who urges for a remission to the largest extent
The committee are of opinion that there may be danger of be-
ing led astray by this conception, as ten millions of money an-
nually heretofore appropriated for the public debt wilt no
longer be needed. The most natural conclusion to be drawn
from this, would seem to be that ten millions is the amount
which may and ought to receive remission. If the remission
of a larger sum can be urged as expedient, it must anso not
from that, but from another cause."
Mr. McK. said, to show that he was not sin-
gular in the view that he had taken of the reduc-
tion made by those various acts to which he had
referred, he would quote the opinion of a distin-
guished Senator, expressed in his place in the Se-
nate on the 21st of December, 1836. In that
speech, Mr. Calhoun, speaking of the compro-
mise act, said:
"We of the South had derived incalculable advantage from
that act, and, as one belonging to that secuon, he claimed all
these advantages to the very last letter. That act had reduced
the income of the Government greatly. Pew, he believed,
were aware of the extent te which it operated. It was a fact,
which the documenta would sbow, that the act of 1828 arrested
at the custom-house one half in value of the amount of im-
ports. The imports at that time, deducting reshipments, were
about «65,000,000 in value, out of which the Government col-
lected about «32,000,000 in the gross. The impoits of the last
year, deducting reshipments, amounted to «120.000,000,which, li
the tariff of 1828 had not been reduced, would have given an in-
come of «b0,000,000 instead of upwards of «21,000,000. He
claimed not the whole difference lor the compromise, but up-
wards of i|2ü 000,000 may be fairly carried to its credit, under
this great reduuion, we of the South began to revive—our busi-
ness began to thn\e and look up But the compromise acthad
not yet disi-Largid us functions Its operation would continue
until the revenue should be brought down till no duty should
exceed ¿0 pei centum ad valorem, and the revenue be l educed
to the ¿dual wants of the Government."
Yes, bjy tne Senator was right. Not only the
Sctrh, but tne North, East, and West, began to
revive. The" business, not of one section, but of
the whole TJnio>?> began to thrive arid look up.
The people had beeu released from a great load of
taxation, by the joint action of the compromise
act, and those of the U\i} of July> 1832, and of
---------M¿y, 1830, and thent;eforward a new im-
pulse was given to their business fnc* enterprise.
In proof oi this, let us again turn to tn\e tables. The
following statement will exhibit the vaJu« °f tne
imports, deducting reshipments, and also oi Joe do-
mes.'ic exports:

He begged gentlemen to observe in the years 183S
to 1836, inclusive, the value of Merchandise free
of duty, was $209,203,943 greater than the value
of the same description ef imports in the years
1825 to 1828, inclusive; and, notwithstanding this,
the value of the merchandise paying duties, either
specific or ad valorem, was $32,745,052 greater,
during the former than the latter term of four
years. It was probably true that some of this in-
crease was owing to the sales of the State or corpo-
ration stecks, which had been negotiated abroad
within the last few years, thus creating a debt
against the coqptry to the amount of the stock thus
sold; yet it would not escape the attention of the
committee, that there was a large increase in the
value of the exports, and hence that at least a cor-
responding increase in the value of the imports
was natural and unavoidable. There was another
striking fact which he would ask gentlemen to
notice, «8 illustrating the difference in the business
of the country in the two periods which he had
been considering. It will be found in the following
statement of the imports and exports of gold and
silver coin and bullion in a term of four years:
Imports.             Exports.
1821 to 1824       $24,411,627       #34,675,778
1825 to 1828         28,672,605         29,433,126
1829 to 1838         28,773,025         21,774,064
1833 to 183S        51,514,328         15,400,570
1837 & 1838         28,263,530           9,484,395
The statement shows that the exports ¿f coin and
bullion were $10,524,672 more than the imports in
the eight years, from 1821 to 1828, inclusiv*, thus
diminishing the specie circulation in the country to
that amount; and, farther, that the imports were
$43,112,719  ore than the exports in eight years,
from 1829 to 1836, inclusive, and that in the years
1837 and 1838, the impoits were $18,779,135more
than the exports, thus making an aggregate in these
ten years of $61,891,804, being an actual increase
to that amount cf the specie in the country—to
which may be added the product of the gold mines
in the South during the same period. It is well
known that the late Executive earnestly desired to
increase the specie in the United States; and, among
other acts of his administration, to further that ob-
ject, he caused to be brought hotae, in gold and
silver coin, a large portion of the indemnities
that had been reclaimed from foreign Governments.
It was not material to his purpose to express an
opinion of the act of 1828, nor to inquire by what
party it was supported; neither would he stop to
discuss the merits of the compromise act, and that
of the 14th of July, 1832, or the claims of individu-
als and parties to the credit of the passage of those
measures. His purpose had been simply to trace
the legislation of Congress, by which important
