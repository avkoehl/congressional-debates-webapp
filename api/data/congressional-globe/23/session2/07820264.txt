THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 18.
He would detain them no longer, as the subject
bad certainly been sufficiently argued and dis-
cussed .
Mr LYTLE said, Mr Speaker Before this
bill goes to a vote on its final passage, I feel con-
strained to say tnat I must differ with some or my
colleagues with whom I havegeneially acted,and
perhaps with a majority of the delegation from
the West The oojections just made to it by the
honorable gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr HUr-
din,] furnish an additional inducement for me,
briefly, to make some explanations of my views at
this time upon the bill before you
I know well, sir, that whenever that gentleman
ehooses to devote the powerful, active energies of
his mind, to the investigation of any subject, that
he can always present that subject in a clear and
plausible, if nota conclusive manner, before th.s
body The only objection I have to his style and
manner of effecting his object, is that his long and
successful piactice at the bar, has had a tendency
to make him forget that he is not here m full
practice before a jury—and that having taken
Bides, he makes his argument, in correspondence
with his professional habits, altogether a one sided
one He has omitted nothing in thepiesentment
of his views, fiom the organization of the navy ta
the present time, which was calpulated topreiudice
the passage of the bill But I did hope, sir, that
when he undertook to enlighten the House by a
comparison between the naval and army expendi-
tures, that his sense of justice would have kept
pace with his zealous spa it of inquiry, and that he
would have made the contrast perfect But, alas,
sir, it was followed out on the one side by facts
m opposition to the navy, and on the other by
assertions in relation to the pay, the duties,, and
expenses of the army, in reference to which my
honorable friend from Vuginia, [Mr yVist-i] who,
by the way, has given to the subject, with a view
to this very matter, great attention, entertains a
wide and total difference of opinion, both as to
facts and conclusions
But, sir, («aid Mr L ,) I object to such com-
parisons—they are altogether erroneous    They
are calculated to cieate invidious feelings between
the members of those two branches of the service
—to awaken jealousies, and produce embairass-
ments which should ntvei exist amongst membeis
of the same family     Sn , the cause is a common |
cause     Both aie contending for the same great
interests, and both should be well paid     I( the
aimy is uidihNrently provided for, let usknow it, [
and apply thire ulso the needful remedy, but as
we aie now regulating nieiely the p ly of the naval*
ofii eis, whystait objections winch may result ¡
i i envy and the henet<uion ot bad blood between
the members of these two chsses of oui  public '
service'    It is n just tribute to tht < ffi ers of the
aimy to say, that in ¡eference to this bill, I  h ivc
heaid but  one'expie-ision  m lebtiont)  it—all
have hoped foi and e k mi iged its passage with
a sjiiiitof mignanimKy and (hivahy, they have
always told me it was right, and wished it «n- I
ce=s    Sir, they aie sworn brethien in arms, fight- I
nig under the same banner, and governed by the
same interests and feelings    Let not discord come
among them, then, by any act of ours, calculated |
to awaken causeless jealousies, wheie all is now .
linrmoniou3 and   friendly       The   matter,   Ml   '
Speaker, is i educed to this poini   it is too lite in
the session essentially to change the features of
this bill, immediate action  is   required, and  we
must e t'ler take this as we fi id it or leave the
navy in a weak and deplorable condition     I am I
free to say, su, if you are not disfiosed to make '
it resectable and sound, abolish it at once—bum I
down your  fleets, and  block up your harbois, '
uestioy your foi tifications, act on the defensive al   !
together, at the erpense of not only the trade a^d
commerce of the country, but «o much of its lib- I
eity as may be considered dependent on a naval ai-
mament—on the maiine power of tneGovernment  I
If, however, it is th  desue of the House to place |
our n ivy on a rank and power that shall corre   [
spond with any a i J all others that she may come I
in  contact wi'h—tnat  oui " stais and stripes"
may float prouaty and triumphantly wherever a [
breeze may waft, or a wave may bear it—that the I
products of our rich and happy country may be ,
safely carried into every port, where any other ¡
ship may nde—that the seamen in our service
may be enabled by their pay to exhibit, in their
mteicourae with those they meet, the aspiring,
generous, and pioud chaiacter of tneGovernment
they represent Pass this bi'l, and finish the
means by which it shall be done Already, upon
the most slender means and dimmisned resources,
have they sustained the national honor, and the
national charactei, at the expense of personal
comfort and independence If you are to l.ave a
navy at all, then let it be such a one as you will
not be ashamed of By your pay bill, show that
yau do not mean that men shall fight your battles,
protect your exiled citizens, cultivate by lecip
local hospitalities with foreign Poweis tnat most
desnable fee'mg of amny and respect, which it is
so eminently our duty and policy as a nation to
maintain, without the indispensable patronage of
the Government they be'ong to Sir, this is noth
mg more than naked justice, anu so far myself
from being honor stricken at the provisions of
this bill, 1 would be glad to have it improved by
the amendments proposed by the gentleman fiom
Georgia, [Wr Jones,] some time back, in refer
enceto theadditionnl giades in the service, thereby
perfecting the navy of our Union, and making it,
in all respects, equal with all others Sir, these
opinions may surpnse some of my fuends with
whom I have acted, but they are the same that I
have always cherished, and hold myself ready to
defend—but not on the grounds assumed by my
honorable friend from Kentucky, [\ii Hardin ]
Fie chustens it a party measure, and holds, after an
eloquent description of the reform and retiench
ment measures promised by this Administration,
that he will hold as responsible for this most ex
travagant proposition the Mmimit)ation and its
fuends' Sir, how is this when, in the same
bieath, he tells us thatone-third of theAdmtmstia-
tton party is opposed to the bill, and that the two-
thuds is made up by the opposition members of
the House? The two averments aie admuably
leconciled to each othei Sn, so fai as I have
seen or heard anything in this discussion, it is
totally exempt fiom all spirit of Darty I go for
the impiovement of this gi eat arm of the National
Government upon principles of national policy
and right Party feeling and paity inteiest never
entered into my brain When reil ctmg or act
ing on it, party feelin"-is dead, as it should be, in
Inference to it, except so far as it maj concern the
common interest of our common country
flic gentleman fiom Kentucky did not seem to
expect suj>poit from the western cotmtiy for this
bill Sir, I admit with lum that an opposition
mi< ht | ibtly and fauly have been anticipated from
oui quntei The close, a id partial, and exclu
sivo policy of those on the sea-boaid to our west
eui interests, was well cilculated to make us íe-
turn the comphmert on this, and on all other such
occasions I3ut I h ive ever icgarded the nivy of
oui country as a subject of the deepest and most
tin illin r nation"! interest I I ave sunk, and have
always been willing to sink, my feelings of local
or sectional interest, in a question that involved
the common welfaie, glory, and peipetuity of the
countiy Born and mutuied in the back woods
a buckeye in feeling and thought, in education,
habits, and aclion, 1 trust, as aRepiesen alive on
thi fi)oi, I shall nevei foiget the obligations thus
imposed upon me by that station of common
national, tndnisible interest Thus, sir, 1 regaid
the bill which proposes to protect and sustain the
navy of our Union I have nevei seen the
ocean, never inhaled a breere from the salt water
I have nevei but once tiod the deck of a man of
war, and have yet to see a ship of the first clasp
under sail But I hope and believe, sir, if! know
myself, that there is that within me, which, if I weie
on the extremes' bonndaiy of oui western fron-
tiers, would nevei, r evei make me forget that I
was an Jlmencan eiti en—would neversubdue the
feelings of pi oud exultation which I still remem-
ber of having felt in eaily boyhood, when hear-
ing of the íesult of the well fought battles of our
gallant tars upon the high seas—nor make ¡re
pause upon a proposition to amend the unjust pol-
icy of the Government towards them, for thegal-
lantry they have displayed, the privations they are
still enduring, and the demands which they now
have, and are entitled to make, on the justice of
their country Again, sir, we are told of the peí -
sions aheady received by the widows of deceased
naval oihceis, and my iiiend before me has in-
stanced one in his own neighboihood I am glad
it is so, and that she is comfor able, and I wish
to God that I could say as much of the widows
of the living officeis of our navy I know one,
sir, whose residence is not out of sight of the
Capitol, who may now indeed be within the sound
of my vo ce, whose gallant husband is on a two
or thiee years' cruise in the Pacific, and whose
salary amounts to the miserable pittance of eleven
hundred dollars, the one halfoi which he has di-
vided with a lovely and growing family, consist-
ing of his wife and some five or six children, and
out of this sum he must interchange civilities as
commandant of the station with the officers of
all other Governments he may happen to find
there
Sn, if you mean to have a navy that will an-
swer the just purposes ana expectations of the
Government, you must expect to pay for it, but
yet we are furnished with a history of the enor-
mous sums paid to different ciews, or received by
them in the shape of prize money Well, sir, it
is eamed only in time of war, and well earned
then, Mr Speaker—earned as much for the coun-
try as for the sailor who enjoys it, for it is a íe-
ciprocal benefit to the country, and whoever the
country may employ to take it By crippling the
resources of the enemy, you add to the country's
stiength, no matter into whosepockete the plunder
goes, or if one farthing should never reach the
coffers of your Treasury But my worthy friend
has had his sensibilities excited, also, by the ap-
pearance of navy officers in the city, and has
told you, that instead of their "maieh" being "on
the mountain wave, and their home upon the
deep," their "march is now from the tavern to the
Cajutol, and their home in oui gallery " He seems
offended at the appointment of a committee to
come on here to explain to the members of this
House and its committee, matter which could
never have been furnished elsewhere. Why, sn,
is there any thing unjust or presumptuous in this'
Their every thing is at stake, the rules and pnn-
ciples by which they are to be goveined, perhaps
foi the balance of their lives, their whole future
destiny dependent on the decision ot the House
this day, sir, upon the fate of this bill, and they
debane I the common privileges of Amencan fiet-
men, of expiessitig their opinions, oi giving their
advice, when it 13 íeally indispensable to conect
action, and denied a beat in the galleiy to ascer-
tain the lesult'
I am unable to perceive or appreciate the enor
mity of this offence The officers of the aimy
do, also, come here, and they have the light to
come, and 1 think the honoiable gentleman wul
find two aimy to one naval officei at this time in
the city, and so great was this grievance, as
complained of by the Secretary of War, from the
too fieqient visitations of his troops here last
wmtei,that he nad to issue a proclamation to
keep tnem off, dunng the session of Congress, as
eveiy gemleman here must remembei lie older
was i evoked, and with at least as much propnety
as ¡t was mad , but we a 1 know the fact
The offi er  of the navy, then, have done no
more than other peoj le—they have looked a little
aftei their own interests— hey found them in
jeopardy, and came, f 1 ti e last time, to their
lescue Sir, I deny that the navy is the " spoiled
child of the Government " She is the abused,
neglected, cast c IT member of Ihe family It is
time hei injuries should be redressed, hei sei vices
rewaided—no better time coul 1 have I appened
than the piesent—even the vo'e upon th  piesent
bill, sir, may be regarded as big with the fate of
the devest mteiests of the country Sir, it msy,
H w II have an impoitant bearing, as it s1 culd,
upon our foreign relations—it «ill show that the
people are avahened to a sense of the d fí.
cuides that are oppioachmg, and to a coirect ap-
preciation of the «erne No man can look at the
papers from the East th s morning, and not I e sat
isfied that a war cloud ¡s now lowenng upon u",
it is plainly visi >le, sir, at least in the hi 1 zcr , I
riistal e not, it will soon be ujion us, and if I had,
or could have my way, so fai from being staggered
by the piovisions  of this   bill, I would add   the
