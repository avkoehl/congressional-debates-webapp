a Mr. C. S. Boutwell, of the State of Texas,

t h rough the cable to pass freely through France.
I would state that there is now a bill 011 tho
table of tho Senate which meets certainly a
part of tho prayer of this petition. I shallcall
it up at an early day. Meanwhile I present

Committee on Foreign Relations.

Mr. HAMLIN. I hav^j a petitition signed
by sundry officers of the Navy, who allege that
gross injustice was done to them in the pro-
motions which were provided for in the law of
July 25, 1800. I have some knowledge of the
facts of some of the cases. I have no doubt
there were remarkable transactions at the
Navy Department under that law ; I have no
doubt that simple justice demands at our hands
a revision of the acts that were there per-
formed ; and I ask the earnest arid candid
attention of the Committee on Naval Affairs
to the subject embraced in this petition. I
move that it be referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.

BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. WILLIAMS asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint
resolution (S. R. No. 69) relating to amend-
ments of tho Constitution; which was read
twice by its title.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I ask that the joint reso-
lution bo read at length.
The Secretary read as follows:
7>r it resolved, &e., That whenever satisfactory evi-
dence is furnished to tho Secretary of State that
three fourths of tho Legislatures of tho several
States have ratified any amendment proposed by
Congress, to the Constitution of the "United States
ho shall lorthwith proclaim the fact of such ratifica-
tion; mid if it shall appear that the Legislature of
a Mate had ratified any amendment proposed as
aforesaid, any other action by tho Legislature of
that State as to such amendment shall 60 void and
disregarded by tho Secretary of State.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I move that that join t
resolution be printed and referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary; and I express the
hope that for obvious reasons it will receive
the early attention of that committee.
Tho motion was agreed to.
Mr. EDMUNDS asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint
resolution (S. R. No. 70) against leasing certain
public lands in the city of San Francisco, Cal-
ifornia; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I move that that joint
resolution be referred to the Committee on
Retrenchment. I believe the chairman of that
committee is in possession of the facts relating
to that matter; and I will only suggest to him
what probably he already is aware of, that I
understand it is highly important to the public
interests that immediate action should be had
upon it.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 299) to promote international coinage;
which was read twice by its title, referred to
the Committee on Finance, and ordered to be
printed.
Mr. FERRY asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
300) for the relief of Alexander C. Twining;
which was read twice by its title, referred to
the Committee on Patents, and ordered to be
printed.
He also asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
801) for the repeal of certain laws therein
named; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. FERRY. As the bill is a very short
one I ask that it may be read at length.
The Secretary read as follows:
Be it enacted, &c., That an act entitled "An act to
prescribe an oath of office, and for other purposes,"
approved July 2, 1862, and all parts of other acts
requiring the taking or administration of the oath
in said first-mentioned act prescribed, be, and the
same are hereby, repealed.
Mr. FERRY. The object of the bill, it will
be seen, is to repeal the laws requiring the
administration of what is known as the test-
oath. Bills were introduced at the last ses-
sion, and other similar bills yesterday, looking
to a general removal of the political disabili-
ties created by the fourteenth amendment to
the Constitution. It has been my hope that at
some time during the present session those
bills may receive the favorable action of the
Senate; yet without still further action repeal-
ing the laws whose repeal is provided for in the
bill which I have now introduced the object
of the former bills will not be accomplished.
The test-oaths now preclude from all objects
of E'ederal ambition a very large proportion of
the population of the southern States; and
until those acts are repealed, the necessity of
which, as it seems to me, has now gone by, it
will be impossible to remove the irritation and
bitterness of feeling which yet, to some extent,
remains in a large portion of our country. I
believe the policy of a general removal of
those disabilities, created either by the third
section of the fourteenth amendment oj by the
statutes requiring the administration of the
test-oath, is a policy which the experience of
the last summer and the universal sentiment of
all parties in the southern States has decided
ought to be adopted by Congress; and as tho
Republican party now in power originally.
enacted those laws for the security of the Gov-
ernment and tbe preservation of the life of the
nation, so now when those necessities are
gone by it has certainly seemed to me that the
same party which enacted them should repeal
them.^ I hope the bill will receive the early
attention of the committee. I move its refer-
ence to the select Committee on Political Dis-
abilities.
The motion- was agreed to.
Mr. CATTELL asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (8.
No. 502) giving the consent of the United
States to the erection of a bridge across the
Delaware river between Philadelphia and Cam-
den ; which was read twice by its title, referred
to tho Committee on Commerce, and ordered^
to be printed.
Mr. CARPENTER asked, and by unanimous,
consent obtained, leave to introduce a biJl (S. â€¢
