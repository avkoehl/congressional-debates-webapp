tents on a marshy shore, wading knee-deep in mud and water to a permanent landing, exposed all night to a cold rain, then fighting for four hours, pursuing the enemy some 8 miles, bivouacking in the rain, many of them without tents or covering, for two or three nights, it seems wonderful that not one murmur or complaint has been heard from them. They have endured all these hardships with the utmost fortitude, and have exhibited on the battle-field a coolness, courage, and perseverance worthy of veteran soldiers. The companies left on board the armed propellers during the naval engagement rendered most efficient service, and are highly spoken of by the different brigade commanders. There had been placed on these propellers, by the brigadier-generals, aides-de-camp, who rendered marked service during the action, as did also the officers and men of the Marine Artillery in charge of the guns, headed by Colonel William A. Howard.

I desire to tender my thanks to Captain S. F. Hazard, U. S. Navy, commanding division of armed vessels, for his efficient management of the division. The vessels comprising this division were the Picket, Captain T. P. Ives; Vedette, Captain Foster; Hussar, Captain Crocker; Lancer, Captain Morley; Ranger, Captain Emerson; Chasseur, Captain West; Pioneer, Captain Baker. The Picket was particularly serviceable in covering the landing of the troops.

I must express to Commodore Goldsborough and the officers of his fleet my high appreciation and admiration of their gallantry, and my thanks for the kind assistance rendered us from time to time in our joint labors.

I have to thank my personal staff for their efficient aid in the work through which we have passed. They are as follows:

Dr. W. H. Church, brigade surgeon; Captain Lewis Richmond, assistant adjutant-general; Captain William Cutting, assistant quartermaster; Captain James F. D'Wolf, assistant commissary; Lieutenant D. W. Flagler, ordnance officer; Lieutenant D. A. Pell, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant G. R. Fearing, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Andrews, topographical officer. All of these officers have rendered most efficient service in their several capacities.

Mr. D. R. Larned, my private secretary, accompanied me to the shore, and, with Mr. W. H. French, my other secretary, were very serviceable in communicating with the vessels and forces, doing the duty of volunteer aides. I beg leave to refer you to the report of Dr. W. H. Church, brigade surgeon, for list of casualties, which amount to 41 killed and 181 wounded.* Among the killed I regret to record the following officers: Colonel Charles L. Russell, Tenth Connecticut; Lieutenant Colonel Viguer De Monteil, of Fifty-third New York; Second Lieutenant John H. Goodwin, jr., Company B, Twenty-third Massachusetts; Lieutenant Stillman, Tenth Connecticut; Captain Joseph J. Henry, Ninth New Jersey. I refrain from mentioning special cases of heroism in the brigades, as it would be wrong to make distinctions where all behaved so gallantly.

In closing this report I beg leave again to call your attention to Brigadier-General Foster, Reno, and Parke, who throughout the action showed the great and energy. From the moment they joined me I have given them large discretionary powers, and the sequel has shown that I have acted wisely. I especially recommend them to the favor of the Department.
