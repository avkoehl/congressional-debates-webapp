Mines and Mining—Mr. Kendall.

ruinous and unprofitable in tho higbestdegree. No
capital can any longer be found for the opening of
mines, no matter how promising, and the result is a
general depression in mining operations.
"Thcso.oncr the ownership of our mines passes
from tho hands of these speculators into those
of men who are willing to enter into mining os a
legitimate pursuit to be followed for years, and as a
permanent investment, the better it will be for the
general interests of the country.
" in order to arrive at this result it is necessary to
restore confidence in mining operations, which can
only be accomplished by demonstrating that mining
can be made a most lucrative, permanent, and sat-
isfactory occupation, that mineral lodes extend
downward to any depth, and that nearly all the
present difficulties may be overcomo provided all
tho smaller interests in a district are consolidated
under one rational system.
" Deep drains and working tunnels have by experi-
ence in Europe been found to accomplish these re-
sults. They are necessary for the development of
our immense mineral resources. But how are they
to be constructed, requiring, as they do, millions of
dollars and years of tune, while no confidence exists
in mining operations ?
" Your committee consider the successful construc-
tion of one such work as the means of restoring con-
fidence in that important branch of industry, of
inducing private capital thereafter to enter freely
into like operations in other districts, thereby adding
much to the wealth, population, commerce, and re-
t-ourct-s of the country, and building up, on a per-
manent basis, the vast empire stretching from the
Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean, whose only
resources are its mineral wealth, and which will form
the future great market for thoagricultural products
of the western and the manufactures of tho eastern
States.
" JJy far the most important and productive mining
district in the United States is that which contains
the Comstock lode, in tho Stato of Nevada. The
imnoVn on that lode are laboring under the difficulties,
already indicated, and for tho want of a deep-drain
tunnel are fast approaching abandonment. Extra-
ordinary inducements present themselves lor the
execution of such a work at this place.
"Your committee have patiently and carefully in-
vestigated all the questions having any bearing
upon the subject, and, without reporting at length
the particulars of the documents, references, and
general information which havo been examined,beg
leave to submit the following general statement ot
facts and conclusions which have induced them to
perlect the accompanying bill, and earnestly recom-
mend its passage."
Sir. what increase of wealth and power and
unity to the Republic when the mineral re-
sources of the new West shall be fairly encour-
aged and developed—encouraged and fostered
by the Government as a wise and provident
policy dictates, and as commerce and agricul-
ture and manufactures have been encouraged
and fostered, by a uniform course of legis-
tiott!
No one needs to be reminded that the paper
currency of the country is but a ficiitious rep
resentaiive of value, and that gold and silver
are the standards all over the world by which
possessions and property are measured. Take
away the basis of the piecious metals, and
where would be our paper promises to pay?
Just in proportion as we approach to an equal-
ization in these two representatives of value
do we approach specie payment. As our solid
metallic currency is increased, our ability to
meet all our financial obligations will also be
increased, giving stability to the Government
and confidence to the people.
Bear in mind that there is a great dif-
ference between the production of gold and
silver and all other productions. Most other
productions are articles of consumption. They
have special purposes, in the application to
which iLieyare consumed and disappear. The
farmer who produces a dollar's worth of wheat
and the miner who digs out a dollar's worth
of gold may derive equal profits from their
different pursuits. Hence, the one stands on
an equality with the other, so far as individual
gain or the interest of a particular locality is
concerned. Yet the wheat is ground into
flour, made into bread, and consumed ; while
the gold dug out by the miner finds its way hito
the channels of commerce, is transferred from
one nation to another, as the balance of trade
may require, and forms a permanent addition to
the stock of the precious metals in the world.
Notice the efi'ectof such addition as illustrated
by many examples. B^or instance, at the time
of the discovery of America, in 1492, the stock
of the precious metals in Europe wasestimated
at $170,000,000. In the year 1600 it had in-
creased to $650,000,000—again of nearly four-
fold.
That extraordinary increase in a little more
than one hundred years had a corresponding
effect. Gold and silver became cheaper in
the same ratio as their quantity had increased.
It required four times as much to buy any
commodity ; that is to say, all commodities
increased in price fourfold. A similar in-
crease in prices can be traced to a like cause
down to the present day.
The increase in quantity, therefore, of the
precious metals depreciates their value in
precisely the same proportion as it appreciates
the value of all other kinds of property. Or,
in other words, the percentage added to the
stock of the precious metals in circulation
adds, the same percentage to the money value
of all property in the world.
Francis Bowen, the best American authority
on political economy, expresses this view in
the following words:
"The general principle is, that the value of money
falls in precisely tho sarao ratio in which its quantity
is increased. If tho whole money in circulation
should be doubled, pripes would bp doubled ; if it
was only incroased one fourth, prices would rise
one fourth."
The same principle is laid down by John
Stuart Mill, well known as the highest modern
authority in England. He says:
" It is to be remarked that this ratio would bo pre-
cisely til at i ii which tho quantity of money hud been
increased. If the whole money in circulation was
doubled, prices would bo doubled; if it was only
increased one fourth, prices would increase one
fourth."
To illustrate the immense effect of this rise
in prices, we will assume the following figures :
supposing that the taxable property of the
whole civilized world is $200,000,000,000, and
that the amount of money in existence is
$3,600,000,000, the addition of $900,000,000
would depi eciate the precious metals twenty-
five per cent. ; and, in consequence, it would
require $250,000,000,000 to purchase all the
taxable property of the world. The addition
of $900,000,000 in money, therefore, would
have the effect of producing $50,000,000,000
in the increased value of pioperty. This m-
ei ease of value may not be perceptible from
year to year; the aggregate result, however,
after a number of years is inevitable. Bowen
refers to this as follows:
"There may bo brief and violent fluctuations in
the relative value of particular commodities, while
the great inoveineu t is steadily going on which slowly
enhances tho value of all."
This increase in value, however, does not
materially affect individuals; for when the
coat of living increases, the rates of wages
increase also, hut it acts as a stimulus to en-
terprise, and thus creates general prosperity.
Hume long ago remarked:
"In every kingdom into which money begins to
flow in greater abundance than formerly every-
thing takes a new face: labor and industry gain
lite, the merchant becomes more enterprising, tho
manufacturer more diligent and skillful, and even
the farmer follows his plow with greater alacrity
and attention. But when gold and silver aro di-
minishing, the workman has not the satno employ-
ment lioin tho manufacturer ami merchant, though
ho pays the came price for everything in the mar-
ket; tile farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cat-
tle, though he must pay the same rent to his land-
lord. The poverty, beggary, and sloth that must
ensue are easily foreseen."
When a debt already exists, it being a fixed
number of dollars, the decrease in value of
each dollar proportionately reduces such debt.
Mr. Alison, in discussiug this interesting sub-
ject, says:
"It will belong to a succeeding historian to nar-
rate the wonderful spring which this country (Eng-
land) made during the five years which followed
1852, under the influence of the gold disooveries in
America and Australia. The annual supply of gold
arid silver for the use of the world was, by these
discoveries, suddenly increased from an average of
ten millions to thirty-five million pounds sterling.
Most of all did Great Britain and Ireland experi-
ence the wonderful effects of this great addition to
the circulating medium of the globe. Prices rap-
idly rose, wages advanced in a similar proportion,
exports and imports enormously increased, while
crime and misery rapidly diminished. Wheat rose
from forty-five to sixty-five shillings, but tho wages
of labor of every kind advanced in nearly as great a
proportion; they were found to be about thirty per
cent, higher than they had been fiveyears before. In
Ireland the change was still greater, and probably
unequaled in so .short a time in the annals of his-
tory. Tho effect of the immense addition to the
currency of the world, to the industry of all nations,
and in an especial manner of the British isles, has
been prodigious. It has raised our experts from
£53.000,000 in 1851 to £97,000,000 in 1854, £95,000,000
in 1855, and £115.000.000 in 1856; and augmented our
imports-from £157.0(10.000 in the former to £172,000,-
000 in the latter year."
The influence upon the public debt of this
increase of the precious metals as a circulating
medium and standard of value, and of the cor-
respondent increase in the taxable property
of the country, is eminently worthy of con-
sideration. Our national debt May 1, 1872,
was $2,197,743,440, and is a burden on an
amount of taxable property estimated, accord-
ing to the census of 1870, at $80,000,000,000,
or more exactly, $30,068,518,587. The amount
of the precious metals now in actual circuls.-
tion throughout the world is estimated at about
forty-two hundred million dollars; and their
present annual product ion in the United States
may be placed at $70,000,000.*
The increase, therefore, by one sixtieth of
the amount of the precious inetuls increases
the amount of the taxable property in the
United States in the same proportion; that is,
by one sixtieth, or $500,000,000 per annum.
Suppose a tax at the rate of one per cent,
to be collected and set aside from this in-
creased value of the property of the country,
we get the following result:
