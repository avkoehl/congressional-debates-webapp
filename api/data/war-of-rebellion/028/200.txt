General R. B. MARCY:

I think I ought to be over at Mechanicsville. It is more central than this, and the right of our lines wants fixing up. I ought to be connected with that point by telegraph. Can your order the telegraph extended from rockville to Mechanicsville? It can be done in two days, and will be of great service. I can then go there, and by that time Averell's brigade, and Tidball's and Gibson's batteries ought to be there to continue and support my line as far as Cooksville, on Baltimore and Frederick turnpike. From the time the rebels --- I judge they are massing in large force, or have abandoned their original design. All reports agree that Baltimore is their destination. Please let me know if the general agrees to my idea of change of position, and whether I can get the other forces named.

General R. B. MARCY:

An Englishman, taken by our pickets at Clarksburg, states he is just through Leesburg, yesterday, and crossed the river about 8 miles from Leesburg, with Longstreet's division, which turned up the river on the tow-path, between river and canal. Had a good deal of artillery and many wagons. Was told that Jackson's division had moved on ahead of Longstreet. Stated the rebel soldiers to be badly cared for, many of them without shoes. I have sent the man, with town others, to the Provost-Marshal-General.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Clarksburg os still in possession of my pickets. The firing last night was on the Potomac, higher up. A man who came into Clarksburg, from Point of Rocks, states that the rebels have there 5,000 cavalry and 35,000 men, and are going to Baltimore, by way of Damascus, Clarksburg, and Cooksville. The rebels say they intend to clear us out here as they go along. I have ordered colonel of First New York to send a squadron to report to First Cavalry, to assist in scouting the country to Damascus and Cooksville.
