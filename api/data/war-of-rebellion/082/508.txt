PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION,

July 27, 1864.

Captain B. F. FISHER:

I have just made a careful observation of the enemy's line from plank road to lead-works, and find no change in their camps. They have not broken up any of their camps, nor has there been any evidence of it to-day. At 11 a. m. discovered the enemy at work on a redoubt or fort of considerable size two miles and a half southwest from station and three-quarters of a mile south of lead-works. A train of cars, eight in number, passed into the city this p. m. No other movement or change.
