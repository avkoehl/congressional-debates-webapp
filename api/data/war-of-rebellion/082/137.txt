[Lieutenant Colonel L. RICHMOND, Assistant Adjutant-General:]

COLONEL: I have the honor to report all quiet on my lines during the night, except in front of the left of Hartranft's brigade, where there was some musketry firing. I commenced throwing up cover for a new battery, last night, on the left of Battery Morton, for the better protection of Hartranft's left, which turns rather abruptly to the rear, exposing his line to an enfilading fire.

Very, respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Yours, very respectfully,
