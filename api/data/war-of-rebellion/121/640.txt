Major General E. R. S. CANBY, Commanding, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: I respectfully ask your attention to the following statement: When the expedition to Sabine River (sent on foot by General Banks) was defeated there were captured, of the Forty-second Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, two colored boys, as I suppose, nearly grown, who were subsequently sold into slavery at Houston, Tex. Their names are Charles Fairfax Revaleon and Charles Gerrish Amos.

I beg to urge that every possible effort may be made to discover the whereabouts of these boys with a view to their recovery and their safe return to Boston, where they belong.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General, of vols., Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners.

By direction of the major-general commanding the department I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 3d, communicating the arrival and confinement of B. H. Hill and S. R. Mallory at Fort Lafayette.

In the absence of definite instructions from Washington you will treat them as political prisoners, confining them in separate apartments, allowing no correspondence to or from others, except through yourself and these headquarters, and granting them permission to take such exercise as may be necessary for their health, consistent with their safe-keeping.

Very respectfully,
