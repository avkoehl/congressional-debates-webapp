OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., September 30, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio:

COLONEL: As the weather becomes colder the prisoners will require to be more warmly clad than heretofore, and you will therefore permit such of them as have the means, and when, in your judgment, it is absolutely necessary, to purchase overcoats or under-garments suitable to the season. To those who have no means of purchasing for themselves, if recommended by the medical officer, you can issue such extra clothing as may be necessary. Make requisitions for such articles as you require.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, September 30, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent of Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Had I succeeded, after waiting thirty hours, in obtaining an interview with you when I was last at City Point, I had intended to explain to you that the U. S. authorities had nothing whatever to do with the treatment that General Morgan and his command received when imprisoned at Columbus. Such treatment was wholly unauthorized.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, September 30, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent of Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: In the hope that the officers of the medical departments on both sides may be mutually released who are now held as prisoners, I offer to you the following proposition: That all persons of the medical departments, distinctly know as such, held as prisoners on either side, shall be discharged, irrespective of numbers.

If you will not agree to the above I propose that all shall be discharged, except one or more designated persons, for whom equivalents may be retained by the opposite party. We designate no one for exception.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
