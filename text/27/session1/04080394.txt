CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

spatched by one European monarch to another
Mr TILLIN 3HAST, after some further re-
taarks, expressed the opinion that the present was
a most mausp'C'ous time to withdraw ourd ploma
tie intercourse with European Government , he
thought it eminently incumbent upon us to tiMin
tain an unbroken friendly intercourse wi'h them,
and keep up a state of alert in eUigenc  a> to ihe
political changes that might occur He shou d op-
pose the amendment
Mr. ADAMS referred to he Executive commu
mcations which had been read, as evinc rg the
purpose of the Present to continue cvr d pis m?nc
relations with Sard ma and Naples, and to h s no-
mination of a minister to each of tnc e courts, as
incurring the responsibility of provid ng for them
As to the ques ion, whether the mission^ bad origi-
nated in th> House or with the Exe^ut ve, he con
s'dered it a quest on of very lutle consequence
He believed no foreign mi ston ever had been
provided for by approonations, without either a
formal or informa1 suag'stiou by the Executive.
By the theory of our Cinsütution, the President of
the United S ates was the ergan of conducting oar
diplomatic intercourse with fouign pjwers, and he
had authori'y, by and with th* advice and co sent
of the Senate, to appoint a minister ti ar/ part of
the earth It was a power with wh ch th = House
of Representa ives had nothing whoever to do, i
had no shire cr pamcipation 11 ¡t Norb'dthe

and, having been so created, it was n cognised is
an existing office, (an abstract on, if you plea-e, -¡,
abstractions seem t e order <f the day ) Tn ap
pointment of a public minister, or charge, or ??«nt
of any son, was a power given to the President,
with the consent of the S-natp When, therefore,
the President made the appointment of a citizen to
perform rV duty of such an office, he did, by vir-
tue of the authority conferred on him by the Con-
stitution, without any ictioa of Co igress whatevir,
make a contract w th that md vidual, wh ch the
two branches of the Legi-lature were bound, the

to provide for But 'here wis a co itrol ovei this

not returned from Prance General Washington
personally mstr icted him, and Mr. M rns went,
and Congress, when it met, voted an appropriation
for his expei es The power to send comni ss on-

day to this, some opposi ion had been made to it,
and th  question hid rften been rased, but tlf-re
was not a President who had not, at one time or
other, exe'ered the powe'.
The power was thus ample Ana unlimited to
bold negotiations with fcreign powers by ministers

W th this view, Mr A nad prepared a resolut on,
which he should offei as soon as it should be in

to inquire into the expediency cf reducing the ex-
pens of our foreign 1 itercourse by reducing the
numbei of oír minutéis abroad
Mr GILMER sw1 he had been in favor of pift-

have m >rj tim to look into the subject, but, as the

After some remarks on the increased exoenses
of our diplomatic intercourse, Mr I adverted to
the injury sustained in consequence of Mr Ste-
venson's notice to the Mediterranean «quadron o
leave the narrow seas, which he considered as more
than counterbalanc ng the advantage  of all our
foreign missions put together It was high time
that public attention was called to the subject, and
he hoped that at the next sesuon M" Adams would
bring forward and press his resolution of inquiry
as to the expediency of reducing the whole system
of foreign intercourse
Mr HOLMES greatly regretted the occurrence
of th" debate He charged Mr. Iagersoll wi h
a design to subvert an 1 destroy our en ire foreign
diplomatic intercourse Mr H. defended the m-
struc ions of Mr Steven on as proppr under tne
circumstances which surrounded him H-* denied
tha* the Hoa^e, as representing the democracy of
tne country, had any thing to di with our foreign
intercourse, all that had boen confided exclusively
to the President and ihe Sena'e, and frgued on tbe
absurdity of discussing such dtheate relations in
a anixtd assembly of 240 men, who never coull
agree on any tntng He admitted the power of
impropriation to be a check on the Eiecutive pow-
er n diplomacy, butpotested against us exercise
save in very extraordinary cases indeed. In re-
nly to the sugges ion that our minis ers in the Me-
dí erranean had no hmg to do, Mt H ad/erted to
tne increasing introduction of cotton manufactures
in Austria and I aly, aid the hrge amount and
va'ue of our eommrrcp in th«it sea
Mr EVERETT went into some siatemenjs,
beaid (as ui.ua ) with great diffifuky, as to the
use of our fish by tbe Catholics of he sou h of
Europe, and the benefit of that trade to our fishe-
ne : aho, as to tne effect of regulating the duty
on oUrn, as in Italy, by its weight, and was un-
stood to argue the propriety of having our com-
mercial interests there guarded by resident agents.
He also defended the conduct of our minister at
London, in advii ng the return of tbe Mediterra
neai squadron hs ao verte J to tbe h ghly excited
s«ate of puolic feeling in England as ful'y justify-
ing Mr S evezuon in en ertatning ftar  lor our lit-
