O'Neal's brigade would cover all the ground, I reported, and was ordered to take position on the right of the brigade, which was in a corn-field, and behind a section of Colonel [T. H.] Carter's battery. It was left at discretion with me to move my men, if they suffered from the enemy's fire, but to remain within supporting distance. I moved my regiment about 50 yards to the right, in rear of the left of General [J. H.] Lane's brigade, where I remained until dark, when I was ordered to take my position on the right of the brigade. We then moved forward about half a mile toward the enemy's position, and remained about half an hour, when I moved by the left flank to the road leading through town, and bivouacked in line for the night. July 3, at 3 a. m., I moved with the brigade through Gettysburg, and around to the right of the enemy, which was about 4 miles, and lay in line at the foot of a hill, the Thirty-second North Carolina being on my right. After some skirmishing, I was ordered to move by the left flank, to the support of some brigade on the left. I moved, and was fronted behind a brigade, and then ordered forward. After firing some little time, I was ordered to let my men fall back under cover of the hill, keeping out my sharpshooters. Again I was ordered forward, and kept position just under the edge of the crest until, about 2 or 3 o'clock, I saw the regiments on my right and left going back. I then reordered my men to fall back some 50 yards, when I was ordered to move by the right flank, and was halted about 150 yards from the position left, where I remained until 3 a. m., and then moved by a circuitous route back to the hills which we had taken the first day, where we remained until Sunday (July 4), 3 a. m., when we left. As to the casualties in my regiment, they were forwarded. * My officers and men acted very well. I would especially mention Sergeant [E. J.] Null, Company H, and Private [W. D.] McAdoo, Company A, both, I am sorry to say, severely wounded. There were many others who acted very gallantly, but these two surpassed all.

Very respectfully,
