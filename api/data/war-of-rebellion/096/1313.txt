HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 14, 1865.

Major General C. W. FIELD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Longstreet and staff accompany Pickett's division this morning in a move against Sheridan's cavalry, and I am directed to say that the command of the line will devolve upon you during his absence.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 14, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Department, &c.:

You will direct Haskell to follow the enemy, if he goes east, until he crosses the Rapin or the Blue Ridge. If he goes toward the Peninsula he will follow as far as he can. From General Fitz Lee's information it is not unlikely that Sheridan will endeavor to get to the Peninsula, in which case Richmond will be threatened. You had better keep all of your troops in the trenches until the movements are definitely known.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
