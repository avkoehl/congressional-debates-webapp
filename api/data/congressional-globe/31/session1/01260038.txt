THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 17,
ed. It is due to the House and to the country
that another person should be elected. And as I
am unwilling to trespass upon the House in viola-
tion of the rule some days ago adQpted forbidding
debate, I will only beg leave to say, that one of my
coHea^ues has said that North Carolina would be
found willing and ready to act-as she had been in
1735, when the Mecklenburg declaration was made.
1 wish to say, that I have no doubt North Carolina
will be ready to act. She will be found in favor
of the Union—opposed to faction and disorgani-
zation, no matter from what quarter they may
come. Her voice in 1849 will be as it was in 1775,
when she heard of the battle of Lexington. She
declared, in her Mecklenburg resolutions, her de-
termination to throw off the yoke of English op-
pression, and she said, as I say now, " The cause
of Boston is the cause of all." The people of
North Carolina will always be found on the side
of La.w, Order, and the Union.
[The close of these remarks was greeted with
applause.}
The House then proceeded to vote, viva voce,
for Speaker.
Messrs. HiixiARDof Alabama, Strong of Penn-
sylvania, Van Dyke of New Jersey, and Miller
of Ohio, resumed their seats at the Clerk's table

Mr. THOMPSON, of Kcntuc&y, rose anil
fered the following resolution, which^he read from
his place :
Resolved, That Messrs. White, of New York; Bayly, of
Virginia. Butler, of Pennsylvania; Jones, of Tennessee?
Schenck, of Ohio; Morehead, of Kentucky; Richardson, of
Illinois.; Hilliard, of A'abama; Cleveland, of Connecticut;
Conrad, of LomMana; Bowhn, of MiSbOuri; and MoGaugheyy
of Indiana, be appointed a committee to consult, devise and
report to this House, the mode by thern deemed most prac-
ticable and acceptab e for us speedy organization.
Mr. THOMPSON said he had but a word to
say in presenting this resolution. It would be
seen that the gentlemen whose names were desig-
nated in the resolution were divided equally among
the slaveholding and the free States; that there
are an equal number of Whigs and Democrats^,
and that the proposition was, in all respects, an
equal one.
The reading of the resolution was called for> and
it was read by the Clerk.
! Mr. ROBINSON moved that the resolution be
laid upon the table.
Mr. THOMPSON asked for tellers on that
monon, and they were ordered and appointed,
(Messrs. Cabell of Florida and Peck ofVermont.)
Mr. STANLY suggested to the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr. Thompson] that the name of Mr.
Ashmun, of Massachusetts, should be substituted
for that of Mr. Wintiirop; and that some other
name on the Democratic side should be substituted
for that of Mr. Cobb.
Mr. THOMPSON said be would cheerfully
acquiesce in the suggestion of the gentleman from
North Carolina, [Mr. Stanly,] and would substi-
tute the name of Mr. Ashmdn, on the Whig sides
for the name of Mr. Winthrop. He was also
entirely willing to substitute for the name of Me.
Cobb, on the Democratic side of the House, the
name of any other member who might be suggest-
ed. He mentioned the name of Mr. Johnson, of
Arkansas. He would, if gentlemen desired it,
substitute that name. For his own part, he in-
tended to vote for any officers or any mode of
organization which might be reported by the com-
mittee. He would put in the name of Mr. John-
son of Arkansas. If gentlemen on the Demo-
cratic side choose to change it, they were at perfect
liberty to do so.
Mr. HALL rose and suggested that the name
of Mr. Haralson, of Georgia should be substi-
tuted for that of Mr. Cobb.
Mr. THOMPSON said, just as gentlemen on
the other side might please He had stated that
he would.vote for any officers or any mode of or-
ganization which the committee might report.
The question, " Shall this resolution be laid on
the table!" was taken up, and decided in the affirm-
ative—ayes 110, noes 66.
So the resolution was Ifiid on the table.
