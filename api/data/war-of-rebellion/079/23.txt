3,600 men and four pieces of artillery, passed back through Mulberry Village and took the New Market road. Forrest, with the remainder, moved back from Lynchburg and took a road toward Petersburg. Roddey reported to have been at Salem last night and went to New Market to-day. I feel it my duty to say that unless there is some change in the management of affairs in this district you need not expect success.

Major-General THOMAS:

Colonel Park telegraphs from Franklin that Forrest was certainly at Spring Hill at 3 p. m. to-day, and that General Lyon was with him, he states, is beyond question.

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, October 1, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Colonel Park, commanding at Franklin, telegraphs that Forrest entered Spring Hill this morning on the Mount Carmel road, with a force estimated at 3,000, no artillery, and left Spring Hill at 11 a. m., going toward Columbia, destroying railroad. Colonel Park obtained this information from N. B. Aikens, a reliable citizen, well known here, who knows Forrest, and who talked with him and saw the force at Spring Hill. Men just arrived at Franklin on hand-car report rebels leaving railroad track near Spring Hill at 3 p. m.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. NORTHERN DEPARTMENT, Numbers 71. Columbia, Ohio, October 1, 1864.

In conformity with Special Orders, Numbers 263, dated War Department, September 28, 1864, the undersigned assumes command of the Northern Department, embracing the States of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Cincinnati being more convenient and central for the dispatch of the business of the department headquarters will be removed to that city on the 6th instants.

To promote uniformity in organization, the department is subdivided into four districts, each State forming one district; headquarters of the District of Michigan will be at Detroit, that of Ohio at Columbus. Officers of suitable rank will be assigned to these commands as soon as practicable. Until such assignments are made the official duties of the district will be transacted as therefore. The District of Indiana and Illinois will remain under their present commanders.

The commanding general requires energy, earnestness, and fidelity in the performance of duty on the part of every officer and soldier in the department. The trust and responsibility reposed in each will be carefully and executed. No one will consider the day as ended until the duties it brings have been discharged.
