I brought through the lines about 800 men in summer clothing, without bedding for a winter campaign, all expecting to return, as soon as armed and equipped, to West Tennessee. During the cold spells of weather many have absented themselves without furlough and gone home. I sent officers with squads into West Tennessee to collect their commands and report to me, but they have been notified of my late expected movement into West Tennessee, and will report as soon as we get there. Then I lost some by death-killed and wounded in the five battles we have fought in the last month-and some by sickness. All these causes have conspired to reduce my Tennessee command.

R. V. RICHARDSON,

Colonel, Commanding Northeast Mississippi.
