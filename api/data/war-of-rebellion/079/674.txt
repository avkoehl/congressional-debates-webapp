you to go on to Johnsonville and see for yourself the state of affairs and report to me immediately how much force you think should be left there. I would rather have you and the greater part of your force at Pulaski, as I want you to take personal charge of the troops there, as my attention may be called frequently to other points.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

GILLEM'S, November 6, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch is received. I will run down to Johnsonville this evening and report to you at once.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., November 6, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Johnsonville, Tenn.:

Colonel Moore has just received here with his brigade. I send him on to Johnsonville direct. Telegraph him at Gillem's if you wish him to go to Johnsonville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

JOHNSONVILLE, November 6, 1864-7 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have just arrived at this place. Colonel Gallup's scouts have returned and report only a small cavalry force of enemy this side of the river; there also appears only to be a very small force and no artillery opposite this place. I think Colonel Gallup's brigade will be quite sufficient for this place, but I will examine the ground early in the morning and report definitely. I think it well to detain all troops at Nashville, except those which belong to Colonel Gallup's brigade.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 6, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Seventeen car-loads of your troops have just reached Nashville from Chattanooga. Will start them for Johnsonville at once. Will keep you advised.

W. J. STEVENS,

Superintendent.
