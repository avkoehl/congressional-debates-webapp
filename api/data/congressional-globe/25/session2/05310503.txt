UNITED STATES BANK BONDS
On mo ion of Mr CAMBREI EIsG, the commute© took op
the * bill to authorize the sale of ceium bonds belonging to the
United is dte<=  '
Mi WlaE called upon the chauman of the Committee of
Wa\s and Means to explain what changes had taken place to
lender the sale oí these bonds necessary now, when so short a
time ago it was resisted, and the Government issued shin
plasters in lieu
Mi C VMBRELENG did object, and always had objected, to
the Government disposing of ita bonds m this form, or, in fact
m any form, but they wtre now at the close of nearly a sevt
mouths' session, and found themselves having made exfraordi
naiy appropriations of an exee^ amounting to thuteen mil
lions These Mi C enumerated, and went on to demonstrate
that the sale of thece bonds was absolutely neceseaiy to meet
hese extidoidmaiy demand's Hu admitted it to be doubtful
v/hethet ihey could be negotiated or not
Mr UNDERWOOD congiatulated his friend fiom New
York upon his altered tine since the last ^e=sion As to the

mate si
Mr CWIBRELENG íeplied they hid by *bom thirteen
millions, not ot couise altogether owing to the sole ai ti n of

cíes, such a1* InJian hobtihties, newtteaties, frontiei hfhculues,

dnt cuy the reverse of that he did at the extra session for
he then tpposed this veiy pioposition, then brought forward
by Mr  U
Mr BELL expatiated at some length upon the change of
ground thken by the Administration and its Iriends upon the
present occasion and commented upon its inconsistency, m
doing which he cited extracts from the messages of the Presi
d ni, communications fiom the Secretary of the Tieasury, the
lecentsp eches ol Mr CAMBREirNG Mi Jones of Virginia,
etc  and defended his own con«H   nev
Mr POPE remarked that it was a matter of n mor impor
tanue what any gen leman said or thought last fall and it waa
but a n ere w steoftnneto be talkn g about consistency on the
last day oftne session Theonly queslion was, did the exicen
cits of the Government require the «ale of these bondsl Large
appropnations had been made, ¡or which no pamcular party
was wdely re ponfible in all had voted for them, and it was
equally the duty of all to provide the meass to meet them He
was well assured that the passage oi this bill was con-
template 1 by no one when the Tie?3iny note bill waa passed
Ihe chanman of the Committee of Wajs and Means had al
ludedtoextraordmar} InJian appropriations, the new army
bill, Ac which had not beui Liken irt  the account when the
gentleman aubmittedhis estima eof the condition of the Trea
&uiy, showing the necessity of i«Kumg ten millions oí Treasury
r o es That was true But tt e new harbor bill the road b Il«,
and oiheis, included in that estímate, had since been defeated,
and the Senate had no amended the o'd harbor bill as only to
requne but half the amount to be expended this yeai This
would about square the account, apd hence he saw no nectesi
tv f }r selling these bonds
Mr VVIfoE inquired if there was any Eiecutivecommumca
iion, any wand requmne the sale of these bonds
Mr CAMBRELENG won! 1 tellthe gentleman, Congress had
alleuftl 1*50000 on account of the Cherokees othei Indian
ti l aties had been ratified, mvoh ing some $1 600 000 within the
la t thiee weeks, and of whrch the Committee of Ways and
Mean*! new nothing till withm the lart ten davs They had
pasoe 1, what hadneverbeen contemplated befoie—a new army
bill, and had added about two or three hundred thousand t ol
iars to the old harbor bill      The fact was that, within the last
ten days, they had added about «4,500,000 to the expense* of the
Government, which were not contemplaied before
Mr WISE insisted that moH of these ought long mnce u
have been anticipated, for they must havtj been befoie the eyes
of the Executive
The bill was then laid aside, to be reported to the House,

The bill to remit the duties upon certain goods destroyed by

Mr C4.MBRELENG, who had reported, the bill, expiesscdan
earnest hope that the committee would not assent to that motion
Mr HOI-1 MAN added that the friends of the measuie had no
disposition t debate 1L
The motion was disagieed to—ayes 42, noes 82, and the bill
having been read by the Clerk-
Mr HOrrMAN adiiesaed the committecin behalf of the bul
Mr PETRIKIN moved to stakeout the enacting clause
Mr CUSHM\N replied to Mr Hoffman, andexpiessed his
oppositton to the principle invulved in the bdl, a principle by
which the Government of the United States resolved itsel f mto an
insuiance company It was the duty of the merchants to protect
themselves by insuiance Pass this bill andasimtlai applica
tion would come m from Hiarleston, South Carolina Mr C
added that the bill would take four or five millions out of the
Treasury
Mr CAMBRBLENG replied to Mr Cusaman, remarking,
first, that he concuired with the gentleman that it was the duty
oí the merchants, mail possible cases,to protect them elves by
having their property insured But what was the case then
under consideration] It Wds a case of one of the most extr 101
dinary calamities that ever happened en this side of the Atlan
tic, and would probably be vvitnouta parallel for a century to
come, he hoped for ever It was a case wheie not only uiepio
perty vr&s destroyed, bu' even the insurance companies them
selves, and hence the merchants not only lo the amc it of
their duties, butan average of one halftheir property besides—
one halfof their whole capita!
With regard to the bill taking four or fivemillions out of the
Ti easury, the go itleman was mistaken The whole amount oftne
postponed bonds was less than amilhon, and the b>ll propo&ed
only the establishment of a commission to examine into t! e
claims of the parties, and then, altei the award w as made, to pay
them outof these postponed bonds
The bil was very briefly sustained also by Messrs CURTIS,
PHILLIPS REED and ADAMS, and opposed by Messrs T "T

Mr CH \MBERS then warned gentlemen that, if tins bill j Am

in princip e and on tin  ground he for sometime warmty op
posed it Mi C said he would oppose the bill till to mouow s

Mr CAMPBELL of Tennessee moved a iccnnsideration of
the vote laying the bill m íeíation to certain Mississippi land
