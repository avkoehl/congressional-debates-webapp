the main roads leading into Sonora eighteen miles over a very difficult trail, and by a very bad wagon road about thirty miles. It does not afford any better protection, nor in my opinion so good protection, to the whole country from Indians as the point selected. There is no public property at the post. A large number of adobes above been made, and are now large piles of mud, the last winter's rains having almost completely destroyed them. The universal testimony of the inhabitants is that it is sickly. I should think it would be subject to fevers, as the nights are extremely cold and the days very hot. The point selected (Calabazas) is an old rancho, for which it is said Gaudara has a doubtful claim. I think it quite as certain that any point we might select would be subject to the same trouble. I think we cann prove that Gaudara has been a very strong sympathizer with the rebels, aided them, &amp;c., and that he used our border to ferment difficulties with the authorities of Sonora. He is a renegade Mexican, and has joined the French, I have every reason to believe. I will direct such evidence as we may be able to obtain to be sent to department headquarters. The post will be situated on a gently sloping plain at the junction of two running streams of water. The roads from Santa Cruz and Guaymas meet at this point, and they are really the only practicable routes into Sonora from this section. Just in rear of the post and under its complete control is a knoll, or rather mands the whole country in every direction from the post. There is plenty of wood for fuel, water, and fine grass on the reservation, also plenty of limestone. Lumber of good quality can be obtained at a distance of not more than sixteen miles over fair roads. I have directed the buildings to be built with lime, as suggested by General McDowell. The men will have plenty of tools, and, I think, will soon make a fine post. I think they should have sent immediately a portable sew-mill and a shingle machine. I have not named this post as yet, as Colonel Lewis has requested the privilege of naming it. This I will give him, subject to the approval of the department commander. I inclose a map of the vicinity. * I have not the facilities for making a copy. Will you please have it copied and the original returned t ome, as I borrowed it to accompany this report?

Tubac is a worthless town, containing about thirty worthless adobe houses. It was deserted entirely until within a very few months. The houses are nearly in ruins, and could not be made available for any military purpose. Since the arrival of troops all of the ranches have been taken up and planted or at least large numbers of them. People from Sonora are coming in to escape the troubles there. Cattle have begun to come in considerable numbers. I found but very few supplies of any kind here, and learn that the posts of Goodwin and Bowie are supplied for about two months. I have directed contracts to be made to meet present wants, and am satisfied that by next summer we can get all of the flour, beef, corn, and beans we need at reasonbable rates. Flour now costs 15 1/3 cents in San Francisco, costst 1 1/2 cents to Fort Yuma, and 8 cents from Yma here. We have contracted for its delivery here for 13 cents in coin. I foud it necessary, and for the best interests of the service, to appoint Mr. James H. Toole, formerly actign assistant quartermaster at Tucson, who is thoroughly acquainted with the people of Sonora, an agent to go to Santa Ana and contract for flour and grain. As there is great fear that the troubles in Sonora will prevent the gathering of a portion of the corps, and also that the supplies will be prevented from being exported by both Mexicans and French, I think I will get all the flour we want at not to exceed 9 cents per pound in coin. I hope
