more it seems, by us last manifesto, to have taken
"the great commercial and pecuniary interest-." of
the Union into its keeping, both at Iwme and

ployment for its immense capital, Il wou'd starve
within such narrow limits It is no more a Slate
institution now than it was undet the old charter,
except that it  existence as the same identical corpo-
ration has been continued by an act of the Legisla-
ture of Pennsylvania, instead of an act of Con-
gress, and that, too, with much gieater powers than
it formerly possessed It never ventured to plant
itself in England under the old charter. No mi,

1!he Senator from Kentucky asks, wh_, pass this
bill? He say-! it is wholly unnecessaiy, and whilst
he admits lhat the present Bank had no legil power
to reissue these old notes, he thinks it ought not to be
prevented from acting thus, because these notes
furnish the best and only universal currency in the
Union The Senator reminds me of the ancient
herein  which existed in the Chuten, men'ioned
and condemned by the Apostle Paul Their due -
trine was, that it was lawful to do ml that good
aught come It seems we are now to hive a simi-
lar sect of political heretics, whose doctrine is, vio-
late the law, if you can thereby furnish ago >d cur-
rency for the people But there was not the least

power somewhere else to establish a Bank, that the
Senator from Massachusetts asserted a general
power in Congress to críate and regulate the paper

such a corpoiation, is wholly unconstitutional an¿
subveisive of State Rights Now, sir, if the bill
were intended to act upon the Bank, as a Pennsyl-
vania corporation, I should abandon the aigument
The president aud directors of this Bank sustain
two characters, totally separate and distinct from
each other. They are ofheers of the Pennsylva-
nia Bank, and m that character they are bejond
our control But they have voluntauly assumed
another character, by becoming assignees and trus-
tees ot the old Bank chartered by Congress, foi the
pui pose of winding up its concerns, and it is m
this chaiacter, ?nd this alone, lhat we have any ju-
risdiction over them We do not attempt to mler-
fere with tin Bank as a coipoiation of the State of
Pennsylvania No, sir we only undet lake to ope-
rate upon it as the assignee ol out own old Bank.
The gentleman asked it the old Bank had assigned
its pioperly to individual trustees, could we pass
any law to compel tln.se trustees to wind up its
concerns' Most certainly we could, because, no
mattei into «hose hand, the duly of winding up
onrBmk may have passed, we should possess the
power to compel a performance of that dtitj

trustees, and will continue until they shall have
closed the concerns oí the Bank.
The jrinil man savs that the power to create a
bank is one implication, and that lo wind it up is
a second implication, and to pass llus bill would
be piling implication up.in implication, like Pel ion

Bank is dead, but even this is not the fact We
have extended its existence at the present session,
without a dissenting vence, m either House, for the
purpose of prosecuting and defendáis;lls suns, and
it has alvv iya continued to elect a President and
Board ol Directors
The Sr-natoi has asked if the Bank of England
or any ot the banks in Canada had ceased to exist,
and their agents in this country should re issue their
old notes, whether we would claim the power of
punishing them for that cause This question, in
my opinion, presents the only instance of haste and
want of sufncient reflection in the gentleman's
speech There is no analogy between the two
cases Congress never created the Bank of En-
gland, nor any bank in Canada, and therefore Con-
gress can never claim any power to close their con-
cerns We assert no power except over our own
Bank and ts trustees We cannot interfere with
the banks of the several State , much less with
those oi a foreign country
The Senator thinks he has caught me in a palpa-
ble inconsistency He says I first condemned the
expans on of the banks in this country, and after-
w _rds condemned the contraction ot the Bank of
Eog and I might have done so, in the special
cave of the refusal of that bank to extend its accus-
tomed credits to the American houses, without any

inconsistency; but I expressed no opinion of my
own upon the subject. In staling the causes which
produced the suspension of specie payments in the
United States, I said that this act of the Bank of
England had leen condemned m that country both
by their statesmen and men of business. I passed
no censure whatever on the conduét of that bank,
and the gentleman, therefore, need not have re-
minded me that it would but little regard my cen-
sure. I am content to confine my humble exer-
tions to out own institutions at home, leaving to
other gentlemen the glory of having South America
on one side of the Atlantic and Greece on the other,
shouting hosannas in their praise.
The gentleman asks, with a .triumphant air,
«here is England and France at the present mo-
ment? Are they not prospeious, whilst we areem-
bm tasted? In regard to England, I answer that
money there is plenty and cheap, and this simply
because business has been paralysed by the great
convulsion under which we have both suffered, and
it is the capital which has been thrown out of ac-
tive employment, fiom this veiy cause, whicn is
now seeking investment at a low rate of interest.
The commerce and trade of England have fallen
off to such an extent that Parliament has been
obliged to boirow two millions steiltng to meet the
cm rent expenses of the Government. In this par-
ticular they are placed in a similar situation with
oui selves And yet after all the light which has
been shed upon me subject, the gentleman still at-
tributes that convulsion which has shaken the com-
mercial world to lis centie, to the removal of the
deposites, the Specie Cireulai, and Gen. Jackson
I have but lately turned prophet, and there has
been such poor success in that line on this side of
the House, that I have almost determined to aban-
don the tride forever In one respect I resemble
the false prophets oi old, because they phophesied
nothing but good This may probably result from
my sanguine temperament, and my desire to look
upon the bright vide of human affairs. In my pio-
phetic vision I have therefore never, like the gen-
tleman, denounced war, pestilence, and famine
against the country.
The gentleman stiongly condemns the members
of the present cabinet I am wllhng to accord to
the President the privilege of selecting In  own
agents and advisers, without any lnlerferencae on
my part When he, or they, shall recommend
measures of which I disapprove, I shall exercise
my right of opposing them as an mdepeneient Sena-
tor I do not believe that any evidence can be
produced that the President and his cabinet are
opposed to the credit system of the country If
this should ever appear, it will then be time enoagh
for me to denounce such a pohs$\ My ínstrues-
tions have prevented me from expressing my views
at length upon this subject They contain nothing,-
however, which forbid me from saying, nay I ant
only expressing iheir sentiment when I assert, that
a separation oi the business of the Government
from that of the banks, would be one of the great-
est blessings which could be conferred on the
country In releasing the banks from the Go-
vernment, and the Government from the banks,
the interest of both parties would be promoted,
mutual jealousies and recriminations would be
ended, and the currency and business of the coun-
try would cease to be involved in the perpetual
struggles which exist for political power.
I might say much more in reply to the gentle-
man, but I forbear.
RESURRECTION NOTES.
REMARKS OF MR. ROANE,
Of Virginia,
In Senate, April 23, 1838—On the engrossed bill to
prohibit the issue and circulation of the notes
of the late Bank ot the United States.
Mr ROANE said- I do not rise, Mr. President,
to make a speech, as nothing was further from my
mind, when I entered  this chamber, than to open
my lips on the subject before us    The Senate
knows that I do not often trouble them, and that I
am always brief in my remarks; and if I was <fcs-
pesed to be otherwise on the pre*ent eecaswn, Í
