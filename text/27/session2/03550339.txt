willingness togivewayif thecommitteedesired to rise
Mr W SMITH said he would be happv to addteas the

Mr PROFFIT did not consent, and the rote on rising was
taken by tellets, who reponed 57 in the affirmative, and 60 m

he accuoed or having was ed more of the Umo of the Hou^e

Francis Eppes, of the Virginia Continental Line, had beea re
jer-ted
The motion was advocated by «Messrs MASON, TALLIA
rGRRO and GOODE of Virgnia, and opposed by Messrs
II ALL ann í VMBS, and some explanations were made by Mr
SMITH of Virginia
Mr HALLtidid he was opposed to this claim, and to the
whole cl i* of claims of this description, ard went into a histo
ry of the legislation of Congress amd other proceedings in le
gardtothem The claim was fuuiided on resolutions of Con
gress passed May 15, 1778 and August 21, 1730 The result!
lions promised the seven years' halfpaytothe widows and or
phans of certain continental officers, butrecommefided the se-
veral States to make provision for us payment Th** Slates
did make provision for such pajment tnd in the settlement of
their accounts w h the United States in 1793 charged the Lm
ted Slates wi h the pdyments they bad made, but the accoun's
were destroyed, and u was now nrniacticableto asceitam ac
curatelyw K&e claims had been paid and whose not These
claims had t>)ertfiom 1794 nil 183^ during which time noi one
had been alb wed Since they had been thus íevivcd, the
1 hn d Auditor, under the direction of the Senetaiy of War, had
applied to the seveialStites for a list of their allowances A
m<)j rity of the States he believed, had i etui ned tí at (heir re

niched such li ts a& the/ were able, none of which, he believed
could be relied upon a« pet feet lists He mentioned the Sta es
of North Cirohna. and Maiyland both of which relumed that
their records furnished no information of any such payments
Buthe showed, lrom other evidence, that b*th States did pass
law-  m oi "dience to the resolution of Congres*, an 1 did make
surh payments though no lists could now be obtained
If thisc!a suf clai ns werenow allowed, the States would

io u military officers, commissioned by Congress, then in ser

August 24, 1780, was not intended to embrace any other
Such, as he had beforeetated, had been the uniform construe*
tion of Congress up to 1832 In 1787 a committee of the old Son
ftress had so reported, and had rejected the chum of a widow
"whose hnsband had died previous to May, 1778 General finos:,
while Secretary of War, had, in 1791, suggested to Congress
ttietPropnety of including those officeisin the provision, and
in 1792 a bill passed the House which included the namea of
seven offices s who had died pievious to the passage of the re-
solution of Ma>, 1778, and seven who had died alter its pas-
sage In the Senate the names of all the officers who had died
previous to theiesolu ion were stricken out,with which amend
ment the House concurred, and the act passed including only
those whose death had oci uired afier May, 1778 Here, then,
was a so emn decision of Congress agtmet the validity of
these claims This act was passed March 27,1792 On the
231 of the same month another act had been passed for the set-
tlement of this class of claims for two years at the Treasury,
after which all not presented were to be barred. Under this
act some twenty or thuty claims of this description were ad-
justed by the accounting officers, all of which were cases
in which the otheei had died after May, 1778, the legislative
construction ol Congiess having been umfermly adhered to by
the Departments
Fiom 179Í the=" claims had slept until 1333, when, after a
lapse of thirty eight years, the papers had been tfunted up from
the files of Congiess, and some ofthe chims which had been
iej cted by Coi giess m 1792, being presented m a plausible
slape weie among the first to be allowed Since that time
about twenty five claims-, amounting to over $50 000 had been
allowed by special acts, not one of which would b<tve been al-
lowed m 1792, and not one of which, he believed, ought to have
been allowed In a large proportion ofthe cases the claims
were so had that no one would undertake to defend them In
sever 1 of the caces it now appeared, by record evid nee, that
theofiieerdil not die in ihe service, but had le&isrned his com
