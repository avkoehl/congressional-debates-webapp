Keep your troops well in hand, and assume command of all artillery within the limits of your line. The First Regiment Connecticut Artillery are available for serving the guns and manning parapet as infantry.

General Hinks will tell me exactly how many troops he can take from City Point and Spring Hill for the purpose of a movement on Petersburg-infantry and cavalry alone wanted. I have sent 500 men from Duncan's brigade to Spring Hill to-day.

May 31, 1864.

General Wild will say exactly how many troops he can spare me and hold his place, under the circumstances, at Wilson's Wharf. Give me all the men, and the best organized he had. I don't want artillery, but infantry. He will also go to Fort Powhatan and see how many troops may be spared there, so long as Fort Powhatan is covered, and what is the best organization to send from there. In-
