Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-General commanding directs me to state that from your dispatch he infers that the main points of the order* now sent to you have been practically carried out by General Griffin. You will, however, determine this definitely in the morning, and the enemy being driven within his works you will extend your line to the left and will determine the positions of his works. General Humphreys will push on and will do the same in his front. You will develop to your left as far as possible consistent with the instructions to protect your flank.
