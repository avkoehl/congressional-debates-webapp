have a man here whom I intend sending out through the country adjoining, but I would respectfully suggest that the most efficient plan by which this work can be done is for you to send some good quartermaster to this place for that purpose, and I will post him and aid him in his task.

I have information again from Memphis this morning. The force of the enemy is being increased daily, and as they now have a great many cavalry I think that any work we have to do in or near this region should be done speedily.

Respectfully,
