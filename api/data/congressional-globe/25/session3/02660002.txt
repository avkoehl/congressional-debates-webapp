force, to serve as auxi'ianes to the system pro-
posed for the defense of the maritime and inland
frontiers It would, doubtless, be desirable to
adopt some unitorm system of organization,
which would render effective the wnole militia ot
tne Unite! States but no plan has yet been sug-
gested thai can be cat tied into effect throughout
the whole of our evtensive countiy That which
appears to piesert the greatest advantages, and
has been frequently pressed upon the attention of
Congrebo by my pied "censors in office, appears to
me to be o ly applicable to the thickly settled
portions of our country for if it were attempted
to divide the militia into classes in some parts of
oursouthein country and on our borders, where
their services are most likely to be required, it
would be found difficult to assemble a single com-
pany of the junior class within a space of one
hundred miles It is to be feared that the whole
militia of the United S ates will be found too un
wieldy a body to be successfully organized at
once by any plan that can be devised and for
some time to come it had better be left to the direc-
tion of the seveial States, adopting only a uniform
armament and uniform drill, until a system be
mtioduced on the fiontiers which may be giad-
ually extended ovei the whole countiy A com-
mencement may be made by enrolling twenty
thousand men, taken from amon¿ the inhabitants
and settlers of the frontier and the country aiound
the peimanent stations in the interior Six con-
secutive days in the year would be suffii lent for
their drill, provided the commissioned and non
commissioned officeis be assemoled foi instruction
at the neaiest militaiy post for the term of thirty
days m the year Dunng the time thepuvates
and officers are m service, they should i eceive the I
pay and rations of soldiers and officers of the
army of the same grade respectively These
forces would not be withdiawn tiom the State3
where they are raised, and may be called into sei
vice by the Governors, upon the lequisition of
the President In this mannei would befoimed
a well disciplined body of militia, capable of act
wg as an auxiliary force both to the legulais
stationed in the four posts above designated, md
to the garrisons stationed in the m intime and fron
tier fortresses, and a system commenced, which,
if it work well, may gradually be extended so as
to embrace the whole mihtmuf the United States
A consideiable poition oí the troof s have been
employed m Plonda under that ludefitigablc and
zealous officer, General Tiylor Engaged in a
harassing service duiin" the sickly season of that
unhealthy climate, they have displayed a spit it
of enduring courige and peiseveiance highly cie
ditable to the American soldiei The theater of
this war is a countiy of dense forests, swamps,
and morasses, the enemy active, subtile, ciuel,
and invisible, and the mode of wirfare one of pui-
suit, by following the track of an unseen foe It
is, in short, a contest entnely devoid of all the in-
centives which usually repay the soldiei for the
toils, privations, and dangers to which his duty
exposes him But the Government has no alter-
native The Indians must be expelled ñom Flor
ida, and the army will make any sacrifice that is
required to protect the inhabitants of that Ten i-
tory from these ruthless savages, and to maintain,
untarnished, the honoi of their arms Duung the
past summei, profiting by the unhealthmess of
the season, the Indians made seveial incursions
into the settlements, committing the most crutl
murders, and, as is usual with them, spaimg
neither age nor sex They attacked the light
houses, and murdered the crews of the vessels
•which weie unfortunately driven on shore, and
wrecked on that dangerous roast The necessary
protection due by the Government to the com-
merce of the country, and to the citizens of Flor-
ida, demands that the utmost exertions be made
to drive these merciless savages from a country
which they have so cruelly afflicted No pains
will be spared to effect this object, but it does not
appear that the means hitherto adopted are calcu-
lated to do so A vigorous effort was made last
year with a formidable force of regular troops and
mounted volunteers Every scheme was tried
that a skillful and vigilant commander could de-
vise, and that brave and active soldiers could ex-
ecute    The morasses were traversed, the forests
and swamps penetrated in every direction, the
Indians beaten whenever they could be overtaken,
and many of them forced to surrender, who were
afterwards sent out of the country, but still, as
soon as the sickly season set m, it was found that
some of these sa/ages had eluded the vigilance of
our troops, gained their rear, and penetrated into
the heart or the settlements, wheie their presence
was %8t discovered by the murders they com-
mi ted and the barbarous cruellies they perpe-
trated upon the aged and helpless They were
enabled to effect their bloody purposes only by
the unsettled state of the country through which
they passed When this war first broke out, the
Indians destioyed all the frontier settlements, and
the inhabitants beyond them in the interior aban-
doned their homes, and were either received into
the service 01 supported at the expense of the
Government A valuable and fertile portion of
the Territory became a wilderness, through which
the Indians wandered like wild beasts seeking their
prey Had these people been compe led to re-
main to picket their houses, to arm themselves,
and form associations for the mutual pro'ection
of their firesides, we should have been spaied the
recital of Indian murdeis and devastations I nis
is what is now pioposed to be done Geneial
Tayloi has been directed to invite the settleis to
leturn to their homes, to receive theij, when
there, into the service, to cause them to suriound
their houses with stout pickets to organize them
into battalions fm mutual defense a part of them
to be kept under arms, while others aie employed
in cultivating their farms No doubt this an arige-
ment will aid in protecting the country fiom the
inroads of the savages, but the farms which will
be so occupied will be too sparse to form an ím
penetrable barrier to the Indians, and it is respect-
lully recommended that a poition of land, selected
by the officers of the Government, should be
granted to such settlers as will bind themselves to
settle on it, and to cultivate and defend it under
such regulations as shall be made by the Execu
Uve
That portion of the army employed m the very
important and delicate opeiation ot removing the
Cherokees, has acted throughout with the activity
and zeal which distinguish this branch of the pub-
lic service The geneious and enlightened policy
evinced m the measures adopted by Congiess to-
wards that people, during the last session, was
ably and judiciously carried into effect by the Gen
eral appointed to conduct their removal,and his
oulers weie executed, both by the regular troops
and the volunteers, in every instance, with prompt-
ness and praiseworthy humanity The reluc-
tance of the Indians to lehnquish the land of
their birth in the east, and remove to their new
homes in the west, was entirely overcome by the
judicious conduct of that officer, and they de-
parted with alacrity under the guidance of their
own chiefs The arrangements (or this purpose,
made by General Scott, in compliance with his
previous instructions, although somewhat costly
to the Indians themselves, met the entire appio
bation of the Department, as it was deemed of" the
last importince that the Cherokees should re-
move to the west voluntarily, and that, on their
arrival at the place of their ultimate destination,
they should recur to the manner in which they
had been treated with kind and giateful feelings
Humanity, no less than sound policy, dictated
this couise towards these children of the forest,
and in carrying out, in this instance, with an un-
wavering hand, the measures resolved upon by
the Government in the hope of preserving the
Indians, and of maintaining the peace and tiai-
quillity of the whites, it will always be gratifying
to reflect that this has been effected, not only
without violence, but with every proper regard
for the feelings and interests of that people The
unprecedented drought which afflicted that part
of the country during the past season compelled
the General to postpone the period of departure
of the Indians until very lately, but since they
have been on their march, the most satisfactory
intelligence has reached the Department of their
progress, and of the good order with which, un-
der the direction of their own ch efs, the parties
are advancing towards their permanent homes.
Th« peaceful execution of the removal of the
Cherokees has been interrupted by the treacherous
conduct of a few warriors, who had fled to the
mountains of North Carolina A small party of
Indians, while marcmng under escort to the ren-
dezvous, took advantage of the kindness and hu-
nid'ii y o*" our men, who had lent their horses to
convey their children more coi v eniently, and mur-
dered them wnile walking heedlessly by their side
The officer omy escaped by the speed and activity
of his hoise A detachment of troops has been
sent in pursuit of the mi rderers, and from the
character of the officei commanding it, no doubt
ib entertained that the fugitive Cherokees will be
promptly arrested This cruel and treacherous
act is much to be lamented, and forms a strong
contrast to the orderly conduct of the rest of the
nation The General commanding there repre-
sents the Cherokees as equally indignant with the
whites, and anxious, themselves, to be allowed to
march against their countrymen, and punish them
for this wanton and cruel murder
Thp Government, on its part, has taken every
piecautionary measure to comply fully with its
tieaty st pulations towards these Indians, and to
lender then newhomecomfortableand acceptable
tothem As soon as a properiegard foi thepeacs
ot that poition of the country, and the piobability
of the successful execution of the measures of
Government would admit, a part of the troops
were íemoved to the noithern fiontier, and sta-
tioned by the Commanding General of the Army
in amann°i to afford protection to that pait of the
countiy It was hoped that the good sense and
respect for the laws which chaiaetenze the Amer-
ican people, would have rendered unnecessary any
coeicive measures to íestiam them from taking
partm the disturbances of Lower Canada But
I regret to say that not only have the citizens of
the United States, living on that frontier, aided
the feeble efforts of the Canadians, which can
terminate only in then misery and destruction,
but others bordering on Upper Canada, where no
disposition to revolt is known to exist,are banded
together in seci et societies for the expi ess purpose
of invading the province of a friendly Power,
which, but for this unjustifiable interference, would
remain in peace and ranquillity The means used
are as reprehensible as the end proposed is nefa-
rious and it is a subject of regret with this De-
partment that it has not at its disposal a sufficient
numbei of legular troops effectively to guard this
extensive frontier fiom all attempts, on the part
of our fellow citizens, tending either to disturb
the peace of Upper Canada, or to succor the in-
surgents in the lower province—attempts which
can only lead to the discomfiture and death of the
parties immediately engaged in their execution,
and to the shame and sorrow of those who, by
thoughtlessly encouraging these acts, have pro-
duced such fearful consequences
In compliance with the expressed wish of Con-
gress, the northern and northwestern frontiers
have been reconnoitered by two able and expe-
rienced officers of engineers, and the result of
their observations will be laid before Congress as
soon as the report of the proceedings is received
It will be seen, from the accompanying report
of the Chief Engineer, that the delay attending the
appropriation for the military and civil works
under the superintendence of that department
until the close of the last session of Congress, occa-
f sioned the temporary suspension of those works
during a great part of the season for efficient
operations
By my direction, the Board of Engineers pro-
ceeded to examine the works of Port Delaware.
The purchase of the island on which the important
work is situated, is again earnestly recommended
to the attention of the Government
The operations at Fort Monroe have been com-
menced, according to the intention of Congress,
and will be piosecuted without interruption until
the works are completed    Measures have been
* taken to obtain the title to the land on which this
fort is situated, and to effect the purchase of the
I bridge connecting it with the main land, as author-
I ized by Congress
In compliance with the recommendation of the
Board of Engineers, by whom an examination of
Port Calhoun was made in September, 1837, the
mass of materials which had been heaped upon
