sufficient escort. The troops with the boats should throw out pickets several miles into the country and scout thoroughly as long on each side as the boats lie there. The enemy should not be allowed to find out that the boats are aground, but should be made to believe that we are sending a large force to attack him. Augusta should be well watched. I suppose Livingston is on that side and will co-operate. The force with the boats, properly managed, should be able to defends itself against anything the enemy could bring there. Send copies of this to commander of flotilla and escort.

Brigadier-General SALOMON,

Commanding First Division, Seventh Army Corps:

GENERAL: A scout reports that a body of cavalry of 100 to 300 was to cross the Saline at Pratt's Ferry (7 miles above Jenkins') some time to-day; object, conscription, &amp;c.; and that a company came across yesterday and examined the road. It would be well to send a party out to scout as far as Jenkins' Ferry to ascertain the truth of this report, get information generally, and clean out any parties of rebels that may be about. Captain Smith's independent scouts will report to you and furnish guide. Telegraph to Colonel Clayton, commanding Pine Bluff, when your scout leaves; perhaps it would be well to avoid the road by which the flag of truce came in till it goes back.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., May 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General SALOMON,

Commanding First Division, Seventh Army Corps:

GENERAL: You are authorized and directed to use your cavalry, and infantry, too, if necessary, to observe the country in your front as far as you may deem advisable, including the communication with Pine Bluff on both sides of the Arkansas River. You will, of course, take all possible care of your small cavalry force, but it is believed that after several weeks' rest they ought to be able to scout more freely without injuring their efficiency. The demonstrations made by the enemy on our line of communication, and the reports which exist of the prospect of a general advance, render it necessary that we should have early and accurate information, and it is important to know what the enemy is doing, but also he is not doing.

By command of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

Assistant Adjutant-General.
