I am very anxious you should go to Nashville, as foreshadowed by Halleck, and chiefly as you can harmonize all conflicts of feeling that may exist in that vast crowd. Rosecrans and Burnside and Sherman, with their subordinates, would be ashamed of petty quarrels if you were behind and near them, between them and Washington. Next, the union of such armies and the direction of it is worthy your ambition.

I shall await news from you with great anxiety.

As ever, your friend and servant,

W. T. SHERMAN.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., October 15, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Corinth, Miss.:

You can take the Fifth Ohio Cavalry, or any other cavalry at or near Corinth except Spencer's (Alabama) cavalry, which is designed for specific service. I do not know what cavalry is at Corinth now. Richardson's battery can go with you. Hatch has driven Chalmers across the Tallahatchie at Wyatt, and if Sweeny had moved as he was expected to, the whole force would have been cut off. General Dodge will be out in the morning to Corinth.
