I have reason to thank Lieutenant-Colonel Pickands, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Lieutenant-Colonel Bowman, Ninety-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Major Stookey, Fifty-ninth Illinois Volunteers; Captain McClure, commanding Seventy-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and Captain Dunham, commanding Forty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, for zealous and efficient discharge of duty while I commanded the brigade, and particularly for promptness in reforming their commands after the repulse at Overton Knob. I have also to acknowledge my obligations to the brigade staff.

On the morning of the 17th the brigade moved with the army in pursuit of the enemy, but was not again engaged. On the 26th of December, the brigade then lying six miles from Pulaski, on the Lexington road, I relinquished the command to Colonel H. K. McConnell, Seventy-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

The provost-marshal of the brigade holds receipts for 278 prisoners and 4 pieces of artillery, besides which Sergt. William Garrett,* Company G, Forty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and Private Holcomb,* Company A, Forty-first Ohio Volunteer Infantry, each captured a rebel battle-flag.
