RICHMOND, June 10, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to present the following report of an inspection made by me of the cavalry command of Major-General Forrest and other military subjects in the department of Lieutenant-General Polk. I herewith inclose the following papers as a part of this report:

A. -Tabular statement of the personnel and material of Major- General Forrest's command.

B. -Field return and organization of the same.

C. -Roster of officers, showing their rank, date of commission, by whom assigned to duty, &c.

A careful examination of these papers will disclose the fact that the present organization of this command was irregular and without authority. It is composed of old and new regimental and battalion organizations, and I will endeavor, as far as practicable, to distinguish between the old and those of more recent date.

CHALMERS' DIVISION.

McCulloch's brigade. -This brigade consists of old organizations, except several companies lately attached to Duff's regiment and McDonald's battalion.

Neely's brigade. -Duckworth's regiment is an old one, formerly commanded by Brigadier-General Jackson, and has been augmented by recruits, recently obtained in Tennessee. The other three regiments, commanded respectively by Colonels Neely, Stewart, and Green, are composed of the debris of Richardson's brigade, and many other partisan and irregular organizations raised in WEST Tennessee, by authorities claimed to have been derived from the War Department, Generals Johnston, Bragg, Pillow, &c.,&c.

BUFORD'S DIVISION.

Crossland's brigade. -The THIRD, Seventh, and Eighth Kentucky Regiments are old infantry regiments, and were mounted during the winter by order of Lieutenant-General Polk. They were then skeleton regiments, but now number 1,124 present for duty. Faulkner's regiment
