HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 22, 1865-12.40 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

In reply to your telegram inquiring if the picket-line of this corps had been advanced, I advance the honor to report that the river of the line of the Third Division and left that of First was advanced yesterday a short distance to take in a clump of woods necessary for corduroing, &amp;c., and strengthening the line; it has made it somewhat stronger. The change was so slight that I did not deem it of sufficient importance to be reported./

NELSON A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General MILES,

Commanding Second Corps

Did you have many deserters last night? Have you heard of large numbers since your morning report?

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 22, 1865-2.25 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Fifteen deserters came in last night. These were included in the twenty-five reported this morning. Since then three only have come in.

NELSON A. MILES,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 22, 1865-2 p. m.

Major-General MILES,

Commanding Second Corps:

I am directed by the major-general commanding to call your attention t the necessity of reporting to these headquarters any change in your picket-line. Although the charge was slight it was sufficient to force General Heth (rebel general) to put under marching orders there-fourths of his command. At these headquarters this latter fact was known. Had it been known that you had advanced your picket-line the cause of this action of General Heth would have been apparent.

Your obedient servant,

ALEX. S WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
