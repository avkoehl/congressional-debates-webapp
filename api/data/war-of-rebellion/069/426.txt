they have that force there. I find upon a fair examination that Ocracoke Inlet had now become quite as good if not better than Hatteras Inlet, while the harbor at the former place in infinitely better, and there is the same depth of water in the swash. At Hatteras, the wasting, drifting, &amp;c., have made Fort Clark perfectly useless. I shall, I think, abandon Clark and re-establish the fort at Ocracoke; have the bar and harbor buoyed out.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., May 31, 1864.

Captain MELANCTON SMITH, U. S. Navy,

Senior Naval Officer, Sounds of North Carolina:

CAPTAIN: Yours of yesterday is just received. The Neuse ram I keep under tolerably good surveillance, and for the present she is harmless. The deserters are not well informed about here. I hope for the success of my captain on the Massasoit, but i have my doubts. I know you will assist him in every way in your power. The Rockland steamer goes up to Roanoke to-day, to remain there and to assist you in every way she can. The quartermaster at the island has been notified that she is there for the naval service at the island. Please inform me if she will perform all the duty required by you. Have you ice and vegetables with you? We can send you them occasionally, I think, if you desire.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
