received from E. M. Morgan, At Temecula, requesting him to hand an inclosed letter to E. B. Sumner, who had arrived at this place with Mr. J. J. Warner, a copy of which I inclose. Sumner had not arrived with Mr. Warner here. He and his companion had stopped at the Dutchman's. I sent out early to look after Sumner and companion, and they were reported coming in at 10 a. m. As soon as they arrived here I had them arrested. The letter to E. B. Sumner gave me good reason to suppose that he and the man traveling with him were the advance of a party that I have been looking for. After the arrest of Sumner and the man with him, I ordered Lieutenant Wellman, with his detachment of cavalry, to proceed to Temecula and arrest and examine the party of eighteen alluded to in the letter to Sumner. On his arrival there, as per instructions from me, the party had moved on, taking a trail from Temecula to avoid our camp. Lieutenant Wellman, however, discovered the trail they had taken and followed it up, sending an express to me. I ordered Captain H. A. greene, of Company G, to proceed with his company to the Valley of San Jose and there detach twenty men, under command of Lieutenant smith, of Company G, to proceed with his company to the Valley of San Jose and there detach twenty men, under command of Lieutenant Smith, of Company G, to look after the valley-several traisl come down into this valley-and to take the balance of his command and go on to Santa Isabel (O'Campo's). At the same time I sent a note to Mr. O'Campo to send an express through on the trail to Temecula. At 12 midnight he sent me an express that they were at Mr. Winter's, on the trail, and as soon as they moved in the morning I would be informed of the direction they took. At daylight on the morning of the 29th the Indians reported them on the move to San Jose Valley. I immediately sent off Lieutenant Vestal, with twenty men from Company D, to close another trail that came out in the valley, but at about 11 a. m. Lieutenant Wellman reported to me the capture of the whole party at daylight in the morning. His report I inclose to you, and would beg leave to say that to the industry of Lieutenant Wellman and men are we indebted for our prisoners. There are nineteen in all. I have examined them all, and send copies of their statements to you; also the oath of allegiance I administered to them. I have had no particular form of oath, and drew one to suit myself. I could find nothing about them that would go to show what they really are. Their ostensible destination is Sonora. I had concluded to discharge them, and informed them that I would, but Lieutenant Wellman has just returned from another scout. His report you will please find inclosed, as well as a diagram* of the trails branching off from the main trail. You will perceive that there are many of them. He intercepted many letters, copies of which, or rather the originals, I send you, which, in my opinion clearly proves that regular organization exists, and that this party, with a few exceptions, is in it. I think there are a few of them who are honest in going to Sonora for mining purposes, but that they have been drawn into this organization exists, and that this party, with a few exceptions, is in it. I think there are a few of them who are onest in going to Sonora for mining purposes, but that they have been drawn into this organization. From the fawho are all bound for Sonora are Southern men is supicious, for where good mines are good miners will go without respect to section. Under the circumstances I have concluded to hold them prisoners until directed to release them by my superior officer. You will see that Showalter only desired to get over the line, and then if interrupted or interfered with to make the best fight they could. You will also find our late compltroller of State, or rather Mr. Brooks, who will vacate the office, is as deep in the mire as they are in the mud. Colonel West sent on two men with Lieutenant
