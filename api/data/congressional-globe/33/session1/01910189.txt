1854.
and, contrary to the advice of many in this House
and in the Senate, who professed to lake some in-
terest in the matter, 1 had it referred to the Judi-
cial y Committee, because I believed that, by an
explanation of the purposes and probable conse-
quences of the change, that committee, or any
other committee, would see the importance, at
least, of the proposed reform, and the propriety
of inquiry into the matter. I wanted the sanction
of a regular standing: committee—of that emi-
nently respectable committee—of this House. I
believed that they could bring public attention  
the attention of this House—-to the question in a
degree which I could not secure for it myself
1 therefore originally desired that the Judiciary
Committee should act upon it. I went before them,
and jy an indulgence of no ordinary kind, and by !
a kindness and courtesy for which I takegieatnjea- '
"U| e 111 making my acknowledgments now, and ;
will at all other times—I was allowed to explain I
the objects of the proposed change; and they agreed !
to report in favor of it. But subsequently, they i
seem to have arrived at the conclusion, that per- j
haps it would be more proper to make the report !
now upon our table. They, therefore, themselves !
propose a select committee. If in intending to ad- j
vance the purpose which they had m view, they i
have pursued such a course, they put an end to all !,
inquiry about the matter. Thus, if the motion of ''
the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr. McMullin,] ij
almost—if he will allow" me to say—inconsuler- ,'j
ately made, should prevail, and that all further ij
inquiry should be closed upon the matter, I should |!
regret, and I am sure that the committee would
renter, that they have not attained the purpose i
which they had m making the report. If they 1
had made it as I desired, and thought myself, indi-
vidually, that it should have been made, it would ■
not have been brought to so premature an end, as
will be the case if the proposition of the gentleman
ftom Virginia [Mr. McMullin] is adopted. i ;
hope thai gentleman will not now, whatever his ;
private opinions may be upon the examination 1
which he has given to the subject, insist in bring- j
ing to so premature and summary a conclusion, |
all inquiry upon this subject. Does the gentleman !
insist upon the motion which he has made? j
Mr. McMULLIN". The gentleman from Ken- !
lucky is mistaken  f he supposes that f have acted '
prematurely m this matter. I am as well pre- Ji
pared now as I shall be at any time during this :j
session to act upon this question. I had supposed !
that every other gentleman upon this floor, like :
myself, wa* prepared to act; and it was for that
reason, and because 1 was unwilling to have the ,
ttme of the House occupied with the consideration
of this question, that i submitted the motion I
did. But if it shall seem to be the pleasure of tins !
House, or of a respectable number of it, that this j
subject be disposed of, with a view to its discus-
swn, I will not act adversely to the feelings of the ,i
House, by insisting upon the motion which 1 have i'
made. Ivly purpose was to move that the subject I
be recommitted  ij
Mr. J>ISSELL, (interrupting.) If this debate l!
is not in order, [ object to it.
The SPEAKER. It is in order, the proposi-
tion to lay upon the table having been withdrawn.
Air McMULLfN. If the gentleman from ■
Illinois will allow me a moment further, I will, for
the purpose of testing the sense of the House, j
move to recommit the subject: and upon that mo- :
tion I call the previous question, so as to afford ■;
gentlemen the opportunity of discussing it here-
after. 1
The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest,
as a matter of foun, that the resolution should be
so amended as to read " to act with such commit-
tee as shall be appointed by the Senate," instead
of " the Senate concurring."
No objection was made; and the modification
was adopted.
Mr. FLORENCE. T would inquire of the gen-
tleman bom Vugima what object he desires to
attain by moving to recommit to this committee'1
The SPEAKER. The motion to recommit is
not debatable
Mr. FLOii EN'OE. I am aware of that; hut I
rose simply to an inquiry. I was desirous of
knowing what the*gentleman expected to accom-
plish by his motion
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Has the morning
hour expired r
The SPEAKER. It has not quite.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
jj Mr. JONES. I believe it is in order,however,

: lore make dm motion now.
The question was taken, and there appeared

ivl1 • iJA V Is, of Indiana, called for tellers upon

tion is taken upon that motion, I wish to offer
!i Tw!"' , move that a11 debale in Committee of
■| the Whole, upon the President's messase, be ter-
: minated on Thursday next at one o'clock; and
j upon that motion I call the previous question.
■ Mr. WALSH", is that motion in order?
] The SPEAKER. It is.
i Mr. WHEtLKR. I hope the House will not
agree to the resolution of the gentleman from Ten-
nessee, [Mr. Joxr.s.]
i th!" J7ALSH' 11 was very magnanimous.
_ 1 he ffouse was divided, and thenrevtous ques- i
tion was not seconded. |
Mr. TAYLOR, of Ohio. ] now move to amend '
the resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee. I
by inserting the fiist day of March in place of.

So the resolution was adopted.
Mr JONES, of Tennessee. I move to recon-
sider the vote by which the resolution was adopted,
and to lay the motion to reconsider upon the table.
The question was put upon the latter motion,
; and it was agreed to.
, Thequestion recurred upon Mr. Jokes's motion
that the rules he suspended and that the House
| resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on
; the state of the Union; and being put, it was de-
: cubd m the affirmative.
The rule^ were accordingly suspended, and the
; House resolved itself into the Committee of the
:: Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr. Our in
j the (hair.)
The CHAIRMAN stated that when the com-
mittee last rose, it had under consideration the
'' annual message of the President of the United
! States, and the resolutions submitted by the gen-
i tleman from Alabama, [Mr. Hoii&tox,] proposing
j to refer the same; and that upon that subject the
i gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Keitt] was
11 entitled to the floor.
Mr. HOUSTON. The gentleman from South
Carolina who is entitled to the door is indisposed
J to-day, and would prefer that the committee should
take up some other bill; and I thei eforeask that this
j bill be laid aside for the present, and that the com-
I nuttee shall take up the invalid pensions appro-
; priation bill. It is a very small hill, and we can
' soon pass it. There are two or thiee of the.se
; small appropriation billy which can be passed this
evening; and when the Hoiuse^oes into committee
to-rnoiiow, the President's mtmyecan ni?nin be
taken up, and the gentleman from South Carolina
: will be able to make his speech.
; Mr DRUM. I would ask what the order is
