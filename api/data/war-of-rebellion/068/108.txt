reached the forks in the road, about 1 1\4 miles out, I was ordered to place my brigade so as to support Battery L, Fourth U. S. Artillery, which was posted on the left-hand road. I accordingly placed the One hundred and twelfth New York Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel E. F. Carpenter commanding, in line of battle on the left of the road and battery, and the Ninth Maine Volunteers, Colonel S. Emery commanding, on the right, throwing out skirmishers to the front. The Thirteenth Indiana and One hundred and sixty-ninth New York, commanded respectively by Colonel C. J. Bobbs and Colonel John McConihe, were held in reserve, forming a second line. About 12 m. I was ordered to make connection with General Burnham's command and support his movement. Having received no information of the position of General Burnham's command, nor of the nature of his movement, some difficulty was experienced in making this connection. It was established, however, and I moved my command forward, in conformity with the movement of General Burnham's command, with five companies of the Thirteenth Indiana Volunteers as skirmishers in front. The enemy retired from the position in which they had been in line upon our approach, leaving upon the ground some knapsacks, blankets, and equipments. Having advanced about one-half mile, and reached the top of the hill across the ravine, I halted the command, that of General Burnham having also halted. Reconnoitered the two roads in front, caused the pioneers to clear the right-hand road of old fallen timber, advanced the command and one section of the battery to a position within range of the enemy's battery across the valley and near the railroad, about two-thirds of a mile in advance. My skirmishers drove those of the enemy from our immediate front and across the valley, and after about half an hour our artillery silenced that of the enemy. It was now near 5 p. m., and the fighting on the right having apparently ceased, I, by direction of the assistant adjutant-general to General Brooks, held my command at that point and awaited orders. At about 6 p. m. I withdrew my command, pursuant to orders, following General Burnham's brigade. the casualties in this affair were as follows:*

On the 12th instant I was again ordered to the front with my brigade, and went to Walthall Junction, but subsequently took position this side of the valley and railroad, by order of Brigadier-General Ames. On the morning of the 15th I proceeded with two regiments of my brigade up the pike to Half-Way House, near Drewry's Bluff, leaving two regiments in position guarding the approaches from Petersburg. I do not suppose any report of the performance of these two regiments to be necessary in this place. Of the part taken by the other two (the One hundred and twelfth New York Volunteers and Ninth Maine) under my command in the battle of the 16th instant, the following report is submitted: Soon after light on the morning of the 16th instant, there being heavy musketry firing at the front, I received a verbal and hasty order, through Brigadier-General Ames, to send one regiment to the right immediately, as the enemy were turning our right. I immediately dispatched the One hundred and twelfth New york Volunteers, Lieutenant Colonel E. F. Carpenter commanding, and ordered him to hasten to the
