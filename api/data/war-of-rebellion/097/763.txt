RICHMOND, April 15, 1865-Noon.

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

I do trust you will not deem it necessary to call an call an extern session of Congress. I believe it would lead only to evil. I am just form Appomattox Court-House, where I saw the entire rebel army lay down their arms. I talked with a large number of their general officers, and found a much better spirit than I had anticipated.

E. B. WASHBURNE.

RICHMOND, April 15, 1865.

The PRESIDENT:

I heartily indorsee Mr. Washburne's telegraph. The change in sentiment here, after contrasting the past tyranny with the present unexpected good order and freedom, makes me think you proclamation of emancipation will be supported by a majority in Virginia.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
