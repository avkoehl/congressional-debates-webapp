J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, February 25, 1865.

Major General J. D. COX,

Commanding District of Beaufort:

GENERAL: Your assignment to the District of Beaufort is for temporary purposes only. The object to be gained by your operations is the possession of the railroad from New Berne to Goldsborough, so that it may be put in order for the use of the army. The troops moving from this place will at the same time open the Wilmington and Goldsborough road, and, if necessary, will act in conjunction with you in securing the crossing of the Neuse River and the occupation of Kinston and Goldsborough. These operations are to be begun at once and pushed forward as rapidly as practicable, so that the workmen may not be delayed in reconstructing the road. The details of your operations are left entirely to your own judgment. Please communicate with me frequently, giving me full information of the situation of affairs.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
