CUMBERLAND, August 27, 1864.

Captain P. G. BIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I did not receive General Crook's order to send the Ohio National Guard home till 23rd instant, since which time troops have been sent forward as fast as transportation could be furnished. They have all gone except one regiment, which is guarding the railroad between here and Back Creek. This regiment will be sent as soon as cars can be had. When this regiment leaves the railroad will be entirely without guard below here. Trains to Hancock will have to be discontinued for fear of capture.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

HANCOCK, August 27, 1864

(Received 7.40 a.m.)

General KELLEY:

Information received this a.m. The rebels are picketing strong from Four Locks to Williamsport, with artillery at Williamsport. Information also received that General Sheridan has fallen back to Harper's Ferry and the rebels are fortifying at Halltown. I received further information that Back Creek bridge is not burned. If you think it advisable, I will proceed carefully down and ascertain the true state of things; if not, to take the train further than Cherry Run, and from there send a scouting party. Please answer.

P. B. PETRIE,

Captain.

Captain PETRIE,

Hancock:

You can send a scout down on hand car, but do not run an engine below Hancock till we can learn more of the movements of the enemy. Send a messenger by turnpike to General Averell and give him all the information you have, and ask him to give me the latest he has. His headquarters is between Hagerstown and Sharpsburg.
