Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Graves,
H. of Reps.
íutd procura for themselves such form of Govermrmntne will
«ecure «e tne Ji these grtat and indispensable obeet*
We have lived for iorty eight years vvüsx the Fedeial Con
stitation, and for iorty years of tfew time we have- had a Urn
ted States Bank, which furmshfrdio the nation the best, ««mm!
est and most uniform curtesy that has ever exist* d There
hftsbeen ho period of the forty year*' continúan ,e of tMat hank,
•wheaits paper has not been better, and furnished a more um
form currency, than gold oi silver itself To  the paper of the
5sao¡ther t>ank, or any ot its branches} was always equal tospecje
■atafiV point in die Union, as remote &oevei a& it might be from
¡tltó bank that issued it, not that one blanch was bound to <e
deem the paper of the others, but because io was always banka
hie paper at any point m the Union, without regard to the place
of lia issue And, in the next place, it was more convenient for
transpoitatiou, so that ífameic íantin Lexington or Cincinnm
had 350,000 in specie, whi%h he desired to pay ovei to his ere \\
tor in New York or Philadelphia, he would conMdei his specie
«ue er a hah per cent Uss valuable at his ho ne tlun i« one of
¡those Eastern cues, that is, he would have to gtve $2o0 if ex
«hange was at a half per cent or^300ifa*foieper cent n order
to g*t a draft upon one oí these enn-e, but i fhe has the paper on
the Vaitml Slates Bank, and he cvn not get a draicat par, ha
only has to bundle his money up, plait it in his pocket, and
convey it himself to its destination, without us being t now  by
a single soul This thing has been done ovei and over aga n
njth the most perfect conveniens hence, V ued fctates paper
has ever been more valuable and more uniformly of the same
value at dtiSsrent places, than silver or gold
Or instance another case ahorse drover in Kentucky, who
carries a hundred horses t  South Carolina, and sells them, say
(Tflf 815,000 in specie, eould not get hn meta" back home with
out a wagon and team, hence he wou'd prefer to buy a chuck
on Kentucky at one per cent and thereby lase $XZO, to the
trouble, expense, aud risk of hauling home his specie, but if he
should receive his pay m papei upon the Bank of Hit- United
States, he would just procure thirty notes of five hundre dol
ttrs each, an Uning home, perhaps m hit  watch oocket, his
«16 0130 Who can, with any \no v leuge < f the business of the
•Gauntry, deny then that the United fctves Bank fui nished a Da
p«rcirculation better and more uniform man - >Id or s ¡ver it
self Then for  ouy yea"s this growing, pro«poous Republic
has been b'es-sed with the best currency up m e i ah, and in the
use of it, has advanced with unpanllelei rapidi'y to wealth,
greatne*s, in J happiness What, however has been the his or>
of the ofher tight years, dm mg whi< h w e uad no United States
TJankí It is one con-inued scene of c infusion and district on m
the ra metaiy operations ofthe countiy, md consequent! v  g

mon^v mafeingj m ine&ot extravagant en eipu^ aid speeu
lation, vhom he can not refuse when dskedt'endoue for him,
and who £ets disappointed m his j ust calculations, and is hurled
with his innocent neighbor from affluence and happiness to po
verty and wretchedness In the foui yeais that succeeded the
recusal to rechartor the United States Bank m 181 , the table
which I read shows how rapidly the increase of paper money
progressed The history o' the last two of the ñve years men
uoned exhibited almost the whole coun rv mvo'ved in bank
raptcyand rum The banksm 1815and 3813, w thpeihapsthe
single exception of those in Massachusetts, suspended specie
payments, and their paper forthwith depreciated greatly be-
low par
In Baltimore and this place, the paper of the local ban rs was
twenty-five per c*nt below par 1 he paper of the local banks
n all the other States was at difieren lates of depreciatu i
Still the customs and dues of the Government wer° collecte in
the paper cunency ot the dnfei it -itatts ad duT rmg with
each other m value So ti at u.e importer of good* here oi m
Baltimore paid one fourth less of daucs on thflir Importations
lian the importers of the same articles in Boston Thus did
the amount of duties paid at the different ports depend on the
depreciatioa of the paper money m that particular State
Tkia was an inequality growing out of the deranged ttate of
ths currency, which was so perfectly insupportable that, with
out a remedy, it would have produced a dissolution, of e
Union, fo  the opera 'on of things wis-o, t* at the C isti utio i,
both m letter aid spirit wis outraged and vio'a'pr' m ih mo«tt
palpable manrer Tho&e oro visions whi^h íequ ire thdt tata
tion shah be unuoim, and tint no port shall have priviitsjes no*
c mmon ti all, were a dead letter, and air men of all panics,
admitted the evil was insupportable, ard must be remedied
The commerce between the States was so crippled upasa'mest
tnDe annihilated No evils of this sort ha 1 existed irom 1791
nil after 1811, when a rtch¿rter was reiu«ed to the timed
Stages Bank the absence of which, it w^ generally ^-nit pd,
proiuced thi^ swarm of local banks wh ch fíist fl oded the
whole land with spnnous depreciated paper mirey, and
finally ended in the convulsion ol !Sl5and lft'6 Thr re exited
then, aa 18 the case now, but one remedy foi tbe disoider of the
currency, and that is a United sta'e*; Bank It was then, as it
k now, known that a caus,e for the leran^td and ruine' condi
tton of the currency existe 1 and it was then thought by all to
be the duty of every statesman fully to pxammemto the mat er,
to ferret out the cause, place it belore the country, an i let the
responsibility of it rest where it belonged There \\a' 'o md
no one then upon the floor of Jongie s who bjectea to find ng
out the caupp of tho embarrassments then existmr, n order to
remove them No one could then be found wno ventured to
reproach other* for professing to be unable to use rnt ans to re
move the cause of great and heavy evil*, hp<nre t>at cause wa*
aseertamed
In 1816, it was believed that th? absence of a United States
Bank produced the embarrassments to remote them, the
cs.use was removed A United State  B~nk was rech-rtered
ana m lees thap one year from that date almost all the banks tn
the Union which did not finally fail fiom gross misma? aeement
or fraud, recommenced °pecie payments Thus, w th the re
moval of the cause its etfectsabodisapp^a-ed I believe ?imi
lar icsulte would occur if we could get the whole truth before
the country and the oeople could see the Caugp of the present
revulsion The «reat body of the people are honest, and they
need but to see what is right to áo it Hence arises the aversion
of the gentleman from Ohio to have the true causes of our em
ba,rr*ietf)ftoté placed in boH relief before the country
Now, if the mends of the admmistiation would admit, what
I am sttre they must believe, that our embarrassments have
g«rw  ffnt of tie downfall of the United States Bank, ar>d join
those who have alwa>e been m lavor of that institution in now
cliarteuna- another upon similar principles the opposition
would desire to say no more on the subject of the cusís and its
causcb ih*n would be neccs-ary to place that matter fairly be
iure the countiy £o mat the people may lully ufiderstand who
aie the authors of oui piesentembairaesments But they re
fuse to admit then selves the authors of our tioubles, and say it
is t ie opposition tl at has brought them upon us and then le
pioach the members oi 'he opj osition lor disproving this most
exfraordin %ry chaige
The gentleman irom Ohio says that tie commercial embaí
ras*mems that now convulse this country have overrun Eng
aland Tiance, Geimany, Switzerland, Turkey, the East Indies
and the Empire of China and then emphatically asks, if it ib
possible tlict any ^en&ihíe man can believe that the removal oí
the Government deposite-, ftom the Bank of the U ate i Mates
to the State banks has convulsed three quarters of the t, obe"i
I have not heard any man, here or elsewhere pretpnd to say
thdt the } resent disasters that ovei pread pven this countiy
are attributable to the removal of the dej osues, md I mudt be
P"i Bitted to say, that the assumption of the honorable gentle
man ib uiauthonztíd, that he has ¿rawn upon his fancy, in
averting that any such position has been taken b> the oppo*i
tion, an i of such assumption ib the greater part of his ver>
long spetA h constituted
üut of all the unaUhoiued assumptions which the honoia
ble membci his POfcn proper to make, the most supremely
ridiculous is that of attributing to the opposition the promulga
tion of the opm on, that alt the embarrassments which he has
chosen to as ert do tow exi?t in China, Turkpy, etc^etc
are owing to the .emoval of the deposites from the United
¡states Bank
But, sir I take i->Bue with the gentierm n upon the question
of fact as to 'he existence of convulsions m England, or any of
the countries which bf* has named, similar to, or compaiahle
with, thye winch we find prevailing in this countiy Vml 1
now invite him fo riee in Iik place and po nt me to the
authoritj upon \\hich he has predicated his assumptions

Indeed, sir, such i thing as negotiating a loan of specie is not
thought of here, for ii an individual has specie on hand here,
he never thinks of loaning it, but proceeds to sell it at eight pex
cent advance for piper money and then, if he chooses, loans
the paper money at six percent making an interest of four
teen per cent on specie here, when it is worth but thiee, as
has been shown in Ene'and
A distinguí hed Senator irom Geoigi-i, m a speech delivered
in the o'her end o*"th s building bin a few day7 since, showed,
