Mr. COX. "Will the gentleman from Mao-
sachusetts [Mr. Butler] allow me to move an
amendment to his bill, to strike out all after
the first section ?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I cannot
at present admit such an amendment, because
the members of the Committee on Reconstruc-
tion, the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Beck]
especially, have amendments which should first
be offered.
Mr. COX. Will the bill then be open to far-
ther amendment?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. It will.
Mr. COX. That will be sufficient for me.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, then ad-
dressed the House. [His remarks will appear
in the Apppiulix.]
Mr. BECK. I propose as a substitute for
the bill which has been reported by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butler,]
from the Committee on Reconstruction, that
which I send to the Clerk's desk to be read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert
in lieu thereof the following:
(Two thirds of each House concurring,) That all
persons, other than tbose hereinafter excepted, now
disqualified to hold office by the third section of the
fourteenth article of amendments to the Constitu-
tion of the United States, are hereby relieved from
such disqualification, and the same is hereby re-
moved, from and after the passage of this act, except
from the following classes of persons, namely:
First. Whoever, havingbeeneducated attheMili-
tary Academy at West Point, or the Naval School at
Annapolis, shall have engaged in the rebellion and
insurrection against the United States, or given aid
and comfort to the enemies thereof.
Second. Whoever, having been a member of either
House of Congress of the United States, shall havo
engaged inrebellion against the same,or given aid
and comfort to the enemies thereof.
Third. Whoever shall have held the office of head
of one of the Executive Departments of the Govern-
ment of the United States, or minister plenipoten-
tiary, or minister resident, or judge of any court
under the United States, and shall have engaged in
rebellion or insurrection against the same, or given
aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.
Mr. BECK. I offer this on behalf of a
minority of the members of the Committee on
Reconstruction. I had prepared an amend-
ment to this substitute; but I understand the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Farnsworth]
has an amendment to offer, and I will not pre-
sent ifc now.
Mr. FARNSWOIITII. I move to amend
the substitute by striking out all after the word
u that," where it first occurs, and inserting in
lieu thereof the following :
All political disabilities imposed by tho third
section of the fourteenth article of amendments to
the Constitution of the United States are hereby
removed.
Mr. BECK. I believe I am now entitled to
the floor.
The SPEAKER. For the remainder of the
hour of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Butler.]
Mr. BECK. I do not so understand it. The
arrangement was that, after the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Butler] was through with
his presentation of the subject I should take
the floor in my own right.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will so regard it.
Mr. BINGHAM. Will the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr. Beck] yield to me to offer an
amendment ?
Mr. BECK. I will do so.
Mr. BINGHAM. I send to the Clerk's desk
an amendment to the text of the original bill.
The Clerk read as follows:
Be it enacted, <Â£c., (two thirds of each House con-
curring therein,) That all legal and political disabil-
ities imposed by the fourteenth amendment of the
Constitution of the United States, by reason of par-
ticipation in the late rebellion, be, and they are
hereby, removed from all persons, except such per-
sons as were Senators and Representatives in Con-
gi ess in the year 18G0 or 1861, or were in either of said
years officers in the Army or Navy of the United
States, heads of any Departmentof the Government
of the United States, or judges of any of the couits
thereof, or foreign ministers of the United States;
and except also all persons who, in violation of said
amendment, have held office since the 1st day of
June, A. J). 1870.
The SPEAKER. How does the gentleman
desire that to affect the bill?
Mr. BINGHAM. I move to strike out all
but the enacting clause and to insert this in
its stead.
The SPEAKER. That is what the gentle-
man from Kentucky proposes.
Mr. BINGHAM. No, sir; he proposes to
strike out the whole bill, while I propose to
amend the first section only of the bill.
The SPEAKER. That is in order. The
Chair understood the motion to be to strike oat
the whole bill.
Mr. BINGHAM. No, sir; my motion is to
amend the text of the bill m its first section
by striking out all after the enacting clauseand
substituting what has been read.
The SPEAKER. That motion takes prece-
dence.
Mr. BECK. As I know the chairman of the
committee desires all amendments to come in,
I will yield in order that they may be now
offered.
