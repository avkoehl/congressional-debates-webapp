APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
663
24th Cong....1st Sess.
Distribution of the Public Lands—Mr. Allan.
Ho. OP R.KPS.
I propose, before I take my seat, to devote
some attention to the consideration of each of
these plans. But there is an indispensable pre-
liminary inquiry essential to a clear understand- ¡
in" of all the bearings of this important subject.
As it is proposed to invest this Government, this
central agency, with the use of this vast sum of
money, the duty is imposed on us of inquiring
how and for what purposes the power already
possessed has been used, before we double this
Dower by placing thirty millions more in its
reach. As it is known that power is ever on the
alert to enlarge its authority, it is the first duty
of the Representatives of a free people to watch
its encroachments upon the public liberty with a
sleepless vigilance.
It is a very proper occasion to pause before we
make this new and important step to the future,
and take an impartial retrospect of the past. We
are just entering upon the eighth year of the
present Administration, and we have before us
the estimates and recommendations for the res-
idue of the terra; so that we now have a full
view of the whole ground; and, upon looking
over it, we shall be better able to decide upon
the present character of the Federal power, and
its tendencies, aud how far it would be prudent
to enlarge its boundaries, by placing under its
control the surplus treasure of the people, and
this retrospect is involved in much difficulty;
there is no subject about which there i* more
controversy, than " What are the principles of
the present Administration?" To this question
you receive a different answer from almost every
man to whom it is propounded. As the helms-
men of the vessel of State, let us turn to our log-
book, and ascertain, if we can, what courses we
have been steering. Let us ascertain our latitude
and longitude, and find whereabouts we are in ,
the broad political ocean.
In several documents to whick I will take leave
to call the attention of the House, we can ha e a
distinct view of the points to which this Admin-
istration proposed to steer, before, and at the
commencement of its voyage. The first 1 shall
offer w the celebrated letter of General Jackson
to President Monroe, which contains, in part,
the principles upon which this Administration
came into power, an e i tract from which is as
follows:
" Pardos me,aiy dear sir, for the following remarks con-
< ernmglhe next presidential term; tbey are made with the
sincerity and freedom of a friend. 1 cannotdoubt they will be
tcceived with feelings similar to those which have impelled
me to make them. Everything depends on the selection of
your ministry. In every selection, party and party teeluigs
«liould be avoided. Now is the time to crush out that mon-
ster called party spirit. By selecting characters most con-
spicuous for their probity, virtue, capacity, and firmness,
without any regard to party, you will g<> far to, if not en-
tirely eradicate those feelings which, «a former occasions,
threw so many obstacles m the way of Government, and,
perhaps, have the pleasure and honor of imit'ng a people
heretofore politically divided. ThP Chief Magistrate of a
«reat and powerful Ration should never indulge in party
feeling*. His conduct should be liberal and disinterested,
alwaj  bearing in mind that he acts for the whole, and not
a part, of the community. By this course you will exalt
the national character, and acquire for yourself a name as
imperishable as monumental marble. Consult no party in
yourchoiee ; pursue the díctales of ttiat unerring judgment
which ha  so long and so orlen benefited our country, and
rendered eon«picuous its rulers. These are the sentiments
of a friend; they are the feelings, if I know my own heart, |
of an ■ndissemblet patriot."                                            |
We have in the paper which has just been read ,
the important principles which the faith of the
party now in power was pledged to pursue.
In theappointmentof publicofficershave "char-
acters been selected most conspicuous for their
probity, virtue, capacity, and firmness, without
any regard to party?" On the contrary, can a
single instance be found where any one received
an office who did not belong to "the party?"
Have we not seen, throughout the land, officers
who were " conspicuous for their probity, virtue,
capacity,and firmness," hurled from theustations
without a charge of misconduct, without a hear-
ing or a trial, because they dared to think and
speak according to the dictates of their con-
sciences, and because they did not belong to "the
party?"
Has this Administration wielded its power to
crush the monster called party spirit' On the
contrary, has not this fell monster been nurtured
and fed until it has become a bloated Juggernaut,
whose voracious appetite has not been satisfied
with a thousand victims of the opposite party,
but has, without pity or remorse, ci ushed beneath
its ponderous wheels almost all its original vota-
ries? Must not all worship at the shrine of this
idol, under pain of their proscription and unre-
lenting persecution? Has not the irreversible
decree gone forth that all true believers, as a pass-
port to office, must repeat the confession of faith
that there is but one God, and Mahomet is his
prophet? We must seek elsewhere for the prin-
ciples of this Administiation; they are not to be
found in the Monroe letter.
Let us turn over another leaf of our book of
reckoning. It is a letter from General Jackson to
the Legislature of Tennessee, upon the occasion
of his being nominated .as a candidate for the
Presidency; an extract from which reads as fol-
lows:
" Upon this principle I ventare fully to accord with you
i  the contemplated change proposed to the Cnnsmution,
and, indeed, would go further, with a view to sustain more
effectually, in practice, the axiom which divides the three
great classes of power into independent constitutional
checks. I w uld impose a provision rendering any mem-
ber of Congress ineligible to office, under the General Gov-
ernment, during the term for which he was elected, and for
tw  years thereafter, except in eases of judicial office; and
these J wrmld except, for the reason that vacancies in that
department are not frequent occurrences, and because no
barrier should be Interpol in selecting to the bench men
of the first talent? and integrity. Their trusts and duties
*oi ng of the most responsible kind, the widest posen hie range
should be permitted, that judicious and safe selections might
be made. The politician may err, yet his error may be re-
trieved, and no considerable injury result; but with judges,
particularly in the last resort, error is fatal, because with-
out a remedy.
" The effect of such a constitutional provision is obriou .
By it Congress, in a considerable degree, would be free from
that connection with the Executive department, which at
present gives * trong ground for apprehension and jpalou'-y
I on the part of the people. Members, instead of being liable
to be withdrawn from legislating on the great interests of
the nation through prospects of Executive patronage, would
be more liberally confided in by their constituents, while
their vigilance would be less interrupted by party feelings
and party excitements. Calculations from intrigue and
management would fail, nor would, their deliberations or
their investigations of subjects consume so much time. The
morals of the country would be improved, and virtue, unit
Ing with the labors of the Representatives, and with the
official ministers of the law, woald tend to perpetuate the
honor and glory of the Government
" But if this change in the Constitution should not be
obtained, and important appointments continue to devolve
on the Representatives in Congress, it requires no depth of
thought to be convinced that corruption will become the
order of the day, and that, under the garb of conscientious
sacrifices to establish precedents for the public good, evils
of serious importance to the freedom and prosperity of the
Republic may anse. (t is through this channel that the
people may expect to be attacked in their constitutional
sovereignty, and where tyranny may well be apprehended
to spring up in some favorable emergency. Against such
inroads every guard ought to be interposed, and none better
occurs than that ol closing the suspected avenue with some
necessary constitutional restriction. We know human
nature to be prone to evil; we are early taught to pray that
we may not be led into temptation ; and hence the opinion
that, by constitutional provision,'all avenues to temptation
on the part of our political servants should be closed."
Here the nation is informed that the power of
, the President to appoint members of Congress to
office is the channel through which tyranny will
approach, through which corruption will creep,
by which the Representatives of the people will
be seduced to abandon the posts assigned them
by their constituents, by which the legislative
power will be brought in base submission to Ex-
ecutive dictation, by which corruption will be the
order of the day.
The annunciation of these great and important
truths by General Jackson, while he was elec-
tioneering for the Presidency, made a powerful
impression on the public mind; and he was elected
to make an alteration in the practice of the Gov-
ernment and a change in the Constitution, by
which the people would be shielded from the
danger of having the fountain of the legislative
power poisoned with corruption.
I will here call the attention of the House to
another document, as a practical commentary
upon the foregoing professions, It is an official
report of the Register of the Treasury of the
amount of money which has been drawn from
the Treasury by members of Congress who have
received their appointments from the present
Chief Magistrate, which reads in the following
words and figures:
