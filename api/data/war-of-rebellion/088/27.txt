that his friends told him that on Sunday last General Lee's cavalry division marched from the north side of the Appomattox River to Dinwiddie Court-House, and on Monday marched back north of Petersburg. This man is familiar with the country about Reams' Station, &amp;c. His wife now lives on Stony Creek, and he has many acquaintances about there with whom he has talked.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Of the three scouts sent out on the morning of the 1st instant two were captured on the New Market road about three miles south of Reams' Station. The other returned this morning and makes the following report: On account of the numerous patrols of the enemy in that part of the country it was impossible to get any information regarding movements by rail. Yesterday, at 3 p. m., this man (Carney) saw a brigade of cavalry go from Reams' Station to Worth's Bridge on the plank road. He thinks it was the picket relief, as there was a regiment stationed at the latter place. Negroes informed him that the pickets had been much strengthened since the engagement on Saturday last.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain, &c.

Captain McENTEE:

Where is the New Market road; between what points does it run? Across what stream is Worth's Bridge?

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The New Market road runs south from New Market, passing near Reams' Station, thence to Sussex Court-House. It may have another name, but it is known in the vicinity of Reams' as the New Market road. I think that Worth's Bridge is over a stream which runs from Warwick Swamp, near Lee's Mill. The man that made the report is not in at present, but will return soon, when I will have him explain more fully.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain, &c.
