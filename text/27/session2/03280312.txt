sures of members of the investigating committee on both sides.
Aea very good exposition of the view? entertained by those
with whom the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] once
acted, he begged leave to send to the clerk's table some extracts
from a speech delivered by agentleman from Indiana, [Mr
Proffit ]
{The extracts were accordingly read, and excited no little
merriment, being received with goals oflaughter 3
The reading being completed, Mr Stanly modified the
amendment he had offered 39 as to strike out the words "First
Auditor of the rreasury," and also #18,900, and to insert $15,900
(leaving the appropriation for the clerks m that office, but omit
ting the salary of the Auditor himself)
Mr PROFFIT said that he had little expected ever to enjoy
the honor of hearing a speech of hia quoted on that fleor, es-
pecially by an extra Whig It was not his intention to say a
word which could, m the slightest manner, reflect on his friend
from Virginia, [Mi Hopkins ] [whom he referred to by name j
He would tell the gentleman from North Carolina, (Mr S^jln
1ST] that he would not drag him in apolitical debate The
speech, a part of which had been read, had been made on a re *
port of the investigating committee at a time when he stood
on this floor o ie Whig against five or six ultra Locofocos from
his own State He had made the speech in all candor and he
could tell gentlemen that he got some credit for it too It had
been thumbed over by every ABC politician on their side,
and had elected half of these men now hereto office, [mímense
laughter ] Yet he had been denounced by the very men he
had put into power, and he had been one of the first men called
upon to bow down to idols they had set up, and because he
would not do it, he had been whistled down the wind, yet he
stood there still, ay, and would continue 'o doso,notwithstand
jng all they might say or do    They could not get him into a
Sarty debate he had too much to do with the gentleman from
Eassachusetts, [¡Mr Cushing,! and the gentleman from Virgi
ma, [Mr Wish,J [here the laughter broke out afresh,] in en
deavoung to do something to relieve the country and to restore
the state of the currency He went for the country he was
determined in the words of Washington, to have no party but
his country If the gentleman chose to keep up an angry
%. party denunciation, in which headmitted that he had himself too
much indulged intimes past, he could do so, but for Mr P as
he grew older he grew wiser The Whigs had told the people
they would endeavor to allay these party dissension*, and pour
oil upon the troubled waters, they were pledged to this, and he
was resolved to perform U Tendering to the gentleman from
North Carolina his thanks for the very flattering notice he had
taken of his speech, he would say to him and to the House that
that was his explanation
Mr CHARLES BROWN said that he thought those gentle
men who had been elected to Congress by the gentleman from
Indiana [Mr Pkoffit] were under some obligations to this First
Auditor, (who came fiom Mr B's State,) since it seemed it was
his case which had, m fact, put them into office [loud
laughter ] Mr B was inclined u) think it was true that the
gen lemau'sspeech did elect som of them, and he hi las ii tie
doubt that tht. speed of another gentleman from his own
State (understood to refer to Mr OgW) had elected full the other
half of them The amendment now offered was moved with a
view to get clear of an Executive officer of the Government by
withholding hi9 salary, and he should not be greatly ¡surprised
if, before long, a similar proposition should he made to get clear
of the President of the United Sates by withholding his He
wondered if it would not be a very good way to get rid of Mr
Tyler? Why not in his case, as^mthecaseof Jesse Milled It
was a new way of doing the thing, and a very ingenious device
itwas Mr. B's objectm rising at thie> time was to v ndicare a
¡renlteirran wluse reputvion hal been wti'Mly assufed in the
ieport referred to He behevrdthua purei, an abler, more
industrious, or moie upright offi er, was not to be found 111 the
public service What were the facts on which the charge in
the report were founded* When h came into office, lie
found that certain books weie some two 01 three yeiis bt hind
hand, because ther*1 were not clerks sufficient to keep them up,
he wasobliged to let some remain so, and he wis told by the
old and experienced clerk^whom he found in offne that it was
not necessary that these should bebimuhtup He theiefore
directed his efforts to g t other books In ought up While
urging on this work, the fust thing he knew about the books m
anear was lhat the defalcation of Mr Swartwout, the collectoi
at New York, had succeeded entirely because these very books
hadnotbeen kept up as they ought tohive been He then set
about establishing a new syst m of entries to prevent the re
currence of such acase infutuie His whole guilt consisted
in not being aware, from inexperience, of the importance of
having these "bond books" written up, and falling into the
practice which he found prevailing when he came into office
There had never been any other charge prefeired against lum
His whole private life had teen distinguished by índustiy and
integrity Hetioped ho would not be availed in the way now
pioposed He was very confident the President would lemove
any public servant who was convicted of malpractice in office,
though ho never could be induced to do this by ameiepatti
san cry
Mr WISP stid that the amendment wif in fact a proposal to
abo ish the office of Tnst Auditor Now whatever might be
Mr W;s opinion of the individual officei, I e could not vote to
deprive the Government ol the offhe \s to he retmi ks oí the
gentleman ftom Pennsylvania [\Tt Bmwv ] he might content
himself with siyins that the report, m whiui the whole case
was de tule 1, was within the leach oí evciy gentleman Mr W
admitted that all (bit wi *aidofMi Miller asamm, misrht be
very ti tie, hr was 1 ichned to heiieve h  deserve d what had I e< n
said ot lum but in Iih offh e, Mi W ha I been compelled, by
the force vl pviJence, to rcpoit him as h u mg buen guilry of in
expiess violation of law and a criminal naglectof his duty The
collectoi at New Yoi k ha 1 heen «suffered to h >ld his office for
three years, without any bond fot thf faithful d scharao of his
duty, besides whicri, ¿ boo'c which ought t> Imvoshown on
every day of every week the balance due from him to the Go
vernment, had been left wi hout the sciaj.e of a ptn from O "to
ber, 1835, to 1839' by in tri-* of which neglect the defalcation
had happened and might hive be**n augmented t iany amour t
Mr W put it to Mr Brown whether he had evei lead the report
of the Investigating Committee?
Mr BROWN aaid the defalcation, be undei-stood, had hap
pened owing to Mr Miller's not knowing the importance of keep
ing the "bond book" duly posted up
Mr WlSEsatd it wag plain the gentleman knew nothing about
the matter of which he had been speaking   the bond book was I
the least important part of the neglect    But this was not the i
time to go into that, the question was, whether the office of First
Auditor of the Treasury should be retained He hoped the com-
mittee would not be thrown into a false position by reflections
on the Investigating Committee He denied that the committee
had done Mr Miller (he smallest injustice
Mr J C CLARK said that the gentleman from Virginia was
mistaken, the amendment did not abolish the office of First
Auditor, it acted only on the incumbent He wondered that
the voice of that gentleman, which once spoke in tones of thun
der against Executive corruption, had of late grown so weak
and so low it was now heardly heard m that Hall But
what had the gentleman been sent there fori And how
was a con upt officer, if retained by his superiors, to be driven
from office but by withholding his salary? The gentleman ad
muted that the immense embezzlement of the public money
by Mr Swartwout had been- kept from the public eye by the
unfaithfulness of this very individual Had not the report of
that Investigating Committee met the eye of the Executive?
And wouldhekeepaman in place notwithstanding an admit
tedand proved violation of law and breach of official duty?
Where were the people to look for a shield against the foice
of Executive oppression unless by their power of withholding
supplies? If this man should thus be displaced, the Presi
dent could then go on and nominate a more worthy incumbent
Mr C  would not vote a cent to pay him
Mr WISE wanted to know by what authority that gentle
man rose and undertook to eatechise him?—and how he was
justified in saying that Mr W had lowered his tone on the sub
ject of Executive usurpation or corruption, especially when he
had just reiterated the «rounds taken m the report? What was
there to justify the arrogant manner in which the gentleman
had made this charge? Mr W's voice might have been
weakened, for its force had been spent m a war against corrup-
tion He might not be able to send such a blast from his lungs
as the gentleman from New York, but he believed that few
in thatHouse beside that gentleman, surpassedhim in strength
of voice But had he not insisted on the charges m the re
port? Could he have said more? Yetone thing more he would
say were he President of the United States he should have
removed that officer long ago, yes, long ago And he had
no hesitation here to declare, (that which was his own secret,)
that he had intimated such an opinion more than once else
where
But, leaving the individual, he wished to look at the principle
of the amendment it was that the House of Representatives
should undeuake to force removals from office by withholding
the salaries of obnoxious individuals Mr W wished to see
this question tried Even in the worst days of corruption,
when in opposing Executive usurpation he incurred risks that
every gentleman, perhaps, would not be willing to bear—not
merely political but personal danger—even in those dark days,
suchan ideaasthatof forcing Gen Jackson orMr Van Buren
to remove corrupt officeis, by refusing their salaries, never
once entered the mind of any man It was virtually to change
the Constitution 1 he Constitution invested the President with
the power of nomination, an 1, under the construction of Mr
Minison, and evei since, it was held tu give him the powei of
lemoval also Had the House of Representatives any thing to
do with this ippomtmgand removing power? The gentleman
from I\ew York shook his head, and yet the gentleman's doc-
trine went that length Wab the House prepared to sanction
it? Weie politicians of all parties prepared for such an i^sue?
—that the wheels of Government must be stopped, un ess the
President wjuld remove any individual who haptened to be-
come the object of patty rancor? Did not gentlemen get in their
friends fast enough, without resorting to contrivances like
these? In this case, it was Irue there extstfd serious grounds

got their hone, would chuckle at their sucre =■ ant'run off and

At one end of it those nominated by the President to office had
then heid cutcfl by the guill'tine of party and in the other

salaries denied'
The Cfí UR admonished Mr Wise that it was not m order
to lefei to acts of the Senate
Mr W said he ha 1 not named the Senate he had named no
body, but he called the attention of the Amencan people tn a
Cd^e which w \ as yet unparalleled m American history The
pioposition proceeded not merely from the vindic iveness of
party, but fiom 1 yrt baser pa«sion—not on1/ fiom the anger
but from the hunger of the brute If the offiees of the Go
vernment were to be devoured by hungry bounds, ay, with a
hunger of twtlve years'standing, though nine tenths of she ( ffi
ees wer  in the hand* of the most bitter partisans of the oppo-
sition, and though the President had to encounter the opposi
turn of enemies m bi3 own camp and all the ingratitude of be-
neficiarles who turned to bite the hand of their benefactoi,
yet because h was w ailing, waiting to see what was done here,
who were the ft lend1-of the couniiy, who were the really effi-
cient m n, he was to be forced, by the withholding of supplier,
to lemove from offi e whomsoever this House might happen
tochsapprove—abranchofthe Government winch had no h'ng

And, besides, the Constitution was in the way Congress)
could not do such a thing The Constitution was not in the
way. If it weie, why had notthe Constitution fixed the sala*
rías of subordinate Executive officer&? It fixed the salary of
the President, bu( left ihe lest to Congress And if one of those
officeis came here asking foi his pay, and the House knew
him to be corrupt and grossly negligent of his éuty, they not
oniy had the power, but it was their bounden duty, to witi hold
his salary, Mr C had ne\er said Congress ought to stop the
wheels of Government To adopt this resolution would produce
no embarrassment to die Government It did not abolish the
office A new nomination might be made to the Senate to-
morrow ' Faction," forsooth' He disdained the charge He
against the President' He came here resolved to smother his
feelings on that subject, and never to suffer his feelings towards
the President, as an individual, to interfere at all with his duty
as a Representative Nor had he Afaction' Yes, there was
a party in that House which had dwindled into a contemptible
faction And of this redoubtable band the gentleman from Vir
gi ma. him self, i' seemeJ, was the Magnus Apollo' Certainly
they had got an able head ' How long he would contmueso,
was another question The gentleman, had he been President,
would have removed the First Auditor long, long ago Well,
Mr C believed he would U laugh ] W hat Mr C com-
plained of was, that he retained this man aftei the facts of his
unfaithfulness had been biought to his notice—by the gentle-
man, as it seemed His "pecuhai friends" ought to advise
him that he was suffering in the opinion of the country by pur-
suing such a policy Mr C had never advocated the idea of
removing a man foi a mere¡difference m politics God forbid '
He was far from holding sue 1 a sentiment, but, in admitted
cases of violation of law and gross neglect of duty, it was the
duty of the guardians of liberty to use the power m their hands
to compel a removal He < id not refer to this case only, mall
similar cases he would do the same Mr C warmly disci aim-
ir g all factious feelings, admitted that he had differed strongly
in opinion from the President, especially in the matter of his ve-
toes, but he challenged the gentleman fiom Virginia to put his
finger on a single factious act of Mr C's since he had had aseat
in Congress He hoped the gentleman would not make such a
charge in advance
Mi JOHN G FLOYD observed that befor he voted on that
question he should like tobe informed in one or two pomts.
He wished to know whether the present First Auditor held the
same office before the investigation that had heen alluded to,
and whethei he held it while General Harrison was President
and Mr Ewmg was Secretary of the Treasury On being an-
swered in the affirmative, Mr F said that though he agreed
with his colleague that the powei of withholding supplies had
been given to Congress,he was fully of opinion that the power
should not be exercised except in extreme cases, and from
what he had been able to iearn this was not one of those cas>es
This officer was retained in his situation while General Harri-
son was Piesident and Mr Ewmg Secietaiy of the Treasury
he held office urde the admimstianon of Mr Van Buren,
while Mi Woodoury was at the head of the Treasury Depart-
ment, he also held h s office under General Harrison while the
Commissioner of the Gen r ill and Office and other officers
were removed, he was also retained while Mr Ewms warhead
of the Department for some five 01 six months, and had been
continued by the pie&eut Administration to this, day Having
thus heen e idoi^ed by three Presidents and their Secre anes of
theTrea^my, Mi V wa« satisfied that the official conduct of
the officer hai not been such as to render his a case for the ex
treme remedy proposed
Mi UN DMiWOOD -aid that he wished to make a few re
maiksupon the prmcip e involved in fl«e piopo°ed amendment.
