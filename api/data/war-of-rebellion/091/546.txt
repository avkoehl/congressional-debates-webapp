Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Harper's Ferry:

I received information of the rebels being in Leesburg at 8 o'clock. Sent scout immediately, who report that they found the rebel picketpost within a mile and a half of Leesburg. Found them to be White's and Mosby's commands, whose force numbers from 400 to 500 strong. None yet crossed the river according to the best information. Sent a courier to the mouth of the Monocacy River to communicate with the cavalry force [First Delaware] stationed at that post. Will report when he returns.

Respectfully,

B. SPENCE,

Captain and Provost-Marshal.
