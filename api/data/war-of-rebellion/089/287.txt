HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 20, 1864.

Colonel ABBOT:

It is not advisable to put the 13-inch mortar in position if as good results can be obtained form smaller ordnance more easily mounted. The enemy is very active on his lines, and it would be well to examine them to see if further maneuvers are necessary. When can you go on comes on the report of the siege operations?

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 20, 1864-9 a. m.

Lieutenant MICHIE,

Chief Engineer, Headquarters Army of the James:

Please have the landing at Aiken's cleared by 3 p. m., as the guns will arrive then. Three 30-pounder Parrotts, Ashby's battery, will cross the pontoon bridge about the same time, probably. Please have guides ready to show the way for both.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

DUTCH GAP, VA., October 20, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that previous to abut 1 p. m. to-day the enemy fired quite rapidly at times, dropping many of their shells among their own men (prisoners) encamped near the canal; but few fell among the working party. Since 1 o'clock have been on duty elsewhere, and can, therefore, send you no correct statement of my own.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 20, 1864. (Received 9.50 p. m.)

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

I sent the body of Captain Quattlebaum to the rebel lines on the Darbytown road this afternoon. My aide who took it ut tells me that there was loud cheering among the enemy while he was there. Very likely it was for the success which at first they obtained yesterday in the Valley, but it may have indicated a fresh arrival of troops. I repeat the fact for what it may be worth. The officer who met my aide belonged to the Sixty-first North Carolina Regiment.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
