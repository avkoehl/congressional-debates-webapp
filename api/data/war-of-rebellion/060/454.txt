Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff, Washington:

A deserter just came in to Colonel Mulligan; reports Early's force to be three brigades of cavalry, two of infantry, with artillery. I fear the wires will be cut to-night. If so, please correspond direct with General Sullivan.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Colonel Mulligan met the wagon-train escort at Ridgeville. They had a severe fight with Rosser's force; lost about 80 killed and wounded; enemy's loss much greater. Lost the wagon train almost entirely. I must now make a strong and quick effort to relieve Thoburn. Send what available cavalry you have with two of Averell's regiments, via Winchester and Wardensville, toward Moorefield. They should take ten days' rations of hard bread, sugar, coffee, and salt. The enemy's force engaged was between 1,000 and 2,000, but it was believed a much larger force was behind. The enemy were all mounted, with four guns. Send Ewing's battery with the troops from Martinsburg. Be on the alert. This may be a combined movement of General Lee's.
