Fiscal Sank—Mr. Woodbury
Senate.
powerful enough to regulate or control such a
mammoth regulator'! If he wants a capital only
sufficient to form a model or pattern bank for an
example to be imitated by others in its form and
action, then five millions are as good as fifty.
On the contrary, if he wants a capital merely
adequate to give facility to fiscal operations and
greater security to billholders, ten or fifteen mil-
lions are by the experienced deemed sufficient for
this, or any other suitable object connected with a
National Bank.
The two most able writers on this subject, and
both Administration politicians, concur in this
view, and yet the chairman, in the lace of their
testimony, pushes the capital up 'o thirty and fitty
millions.
For what possible purpose this is done, it is dif-
ficult to understand, unless ulterior and political
objects are to be advanced by it, which the new
location of the Bank here, at tbe centre of politi-
cal influence, may faintly shadow forth
A Bank, needed to operate as an imme late
check on all State banks, and thus at once preven
over-issues, must, to be thus effective, when dis-
persed by branches in every legion, have a capnal
nearly as large as all tbe bank with which it is
called to contend Then it would requite, as be
fore stated, three or four hundred millions instead
of only thirty, and be open to all tl,e objections
before named in connection with so enormous a
capital. But, again- if only having enough capi-
tal merely to concentrate a power on any institu-
tion sufficient gradually to check its excesses, or
break up in litre its rash operation ., a few millions
could be rendered efficient for this purpose if net
directed to other purpose* ot speculattt n or politics
The whole capital of the Bank of Pi anee is on-
ly $13,000,000, instead ot #30,000 000 or $50 -
000,000, and for a population of 35 000,000, in-
stead of 17,000,000, like ours It is a country,
too, where there is beside not a tenth ol the bariu-
ms; capital in other institutions which exist here,
and is of so much highei credit and power thati
even the Bank of England, that the latter was
obliged last year to borrow specie from it to pre-
vent suspension. So the present political friends
of the chairman in 1814 and 1816 (such men as
Ctaston, Hopkwson, Sergeant, and Webster) all
contended against a capital as large as this That
*vas a time, also, when the whole country had on-
ly about #10 of bank capital to one person in its
population, while, now, the chairman insists upon
having $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 rapital more,
when tbe whole country already has $32 of capital
to ea i person.
Bui a order to meet every suggestion offered in
favor i I this large amount of capital, it may be ne-
cessary to show that it is not needed, as the chair-
man seemed to suppose, for discharging the busi-
ness of exchanges Whether we should or should
not borrow capital for such an object, it is certain
that the Bank oí the United States actually per-
formed little m respect to exchanges, whether fo
reign oi domestic, and its capital of only ten mil-
lions proved tenfold more than it ever devoted to
that branch of business
The second Bank, for many years, it will be seen
by the printed returns, did quite as little in the ex-
change line, and properly left this business as a
mercantile transaction, to be performed chiefly by
merchants and brokers The difference in real ex-
changes, whether foreign or domestic, can never
be obviated, remedied, or equalize 1 by a Bank,
though its capital were $500 000 000, nor can the
real rate of exchanges, which consists merely in the
difference between the value of specie, or specie
paying Bank paper, in one place arid another, ever
exceed the cost of transporting ^p cie from one
to the other. If the apparent difference be greater
than this rate, it must art'e from the depreciated
paper in which it is computed, and not because the
difference is greater in specie. Rence the real
rate of exchange, either from St. Louis, New Or-
leans, or Detroit, can seldom exceed two per cent
and since the goll bill m 1834, and the greater
abundance of that metal, have made he rate, usual
ly, near half of one per cent lower than before
This the tables laid before Congress heretofore b}
tbe Treasury Department demonstrate, whether a
United States Bank has been m existence or
not A very s'rong illustration of this exis's in
the operations of the much-abused Sub-Treasury
only the last winter While nominal exchanges
were from three to five per cent, against New Or-
leans and in favor of New York, an exchange of
Mexican dollars in the former place for «pecie in
the latter was effected at par, besides teceiving tbe
lattet in advance, and this, to the extent of near
two hundred thousand dollars
Such a Bank cannot have the slightest influence
in reducing exchanges, however large lis capital,
except by underbidding at first, so as to nionopo
lize more of them than other institutions or indivi-
duals, thus to k>sen competitors, and, in the end,
by its wish* and inevitable tendency to make pro-
fits, to raise the price as soon as it procures full
possession of tbe market I admit that, to far as
it improves the currency, it reduces the appartnt
rate, but never the real one This last is regul-tcd
by the stale of indebtedness and balance of i n-
ports and exports between any two places, and
not by a Bank, and the cost of equalizing or trans-
porting funds from one to the other in specie is
the maximum of the rate of exchange. Mr Bid-
die, in 1832, before the committee seemed to take
credit to the Bank, that, under its influence, the
expenses had been low, and seldom higher than the
expense of transporting specie, when, m truth,
that expense should be the maximum, whether a
Bank exists or not Yet it was raised even
highei than that, at times, by the second United
States Bank—(Appleton, p 34) The foreign
exchanges do not exceed the same rate of dif-
ference, and they rest on the same princi-
ples, making allowance for the different mode
ot nominally computing the pound ster-
ling They are seldom higher or lower than the
par by more than two per cení or the expense ot
transporting specie The Bank will never either
reduce or equalize these, unless it can change all
the great laws oí trade f< r the whole civilized
world It is ridiculous to hear the exultation of
its friends on this last subject, and on the high cre-
dit and value of their bills and notes even in India
and China, when they have been obhsred to ship
millions on millions to Europe, to meet those veiy
bills there, instead of sending it beyond the Cape
of Good Hope
Down to 1831, it appears, by returns on jour
records, that over four and ihree-founhs millions
had been thus shipped to Europe, and probab'v
double as much since in the convulsions of 1837
to 1840, when the president of the Bank con^i ler-
ed it his first duty to send his s.pecie abroad to pay
foreign creditors, rather than to r< deem his bills at
home
What did the community here gam by sending
the specie to Europe, rather than India? and what
did it gam in the price of foreign exchange, when
the Bank, instead of individuals, was obliged to
ship specie to meet an unfavorable state of tbe ex-
change, and the community had to pay the Bank
for the bills quite as much, if n< t more tban it
would have coit it to export the specie without ihe
interference of the Bank?
Just so in respect to the domestic exchanges
s nee the Bank began to deal extensively in them
It transported from the West and Southwest before
1832 quite twenty three million? of specie, to help
to pay for its ¿rafts and bills of exchange, and the
cost of doing this had, of cour e, to he paid by the
persons who bought its diaib and bills at a premi-
um, and had to be pii 1 at a ra e quite as high as
if individuals had the.rs Ivfs transpor ed the spe
cie without the interfere! ce of the Bank This
has led, also, at time^, to ruinous accommodation
or horse-race bills, and a system oi kiting which
renders this species of business, howeie profitable
m appearance, very lu 1 cf t azard, and, under a
slight reduction in puces of our gnat staples,
fraught with disasters
Does any man in his senses behe\ e ha' the
Bank, in its eagerness to make profi s and 1?rge di-
vidends, would aid the exchanges for nothing, but,
on the conir irj, would not sell high, and purchase
cheap m li pos ¡He odes? D d rot Mr Ci«rw
ford rci propiae tojix a maximum onits rale of fx-
change$, so as to prevent extortion?    Exchanges are
cfien at par between different cities, and also be-
tween America and Europe The Bank t>as
seized on such occasions to exhibit a list of its ex-
changes without a premium, when, in fact, nobody
else then charged a premium, and when this state
of things was effected by the great laws of trade,
making tbe exports and imports, or the the in-
debtedness between those places at that time ba-
lanced, or equal, rather tban being effected by any
action of the Bank
But if different cities m the same country, or if
different countries, will overtr>de and reader one
much indebted to the other, no banking institution
m the world is so liberal as gratuitously to equalize
the exchanges at great loss. And it is as salutary
to the community which has overtraded to be made
to pay a difference in exchange, as it is for the hu-
man system to fee! pain ¿Iter excessive indulgence,
cr for the dissipated to buy repentance somewhat
dear What e! e is to chetk speculation or over-
action in business?
In proof of these positions, allow me to rerer
merely to two cr three high authorities on matters
of this kind A committee of the House of Re-
presentatives, m February, 1823, friendly to the
Bank, and with Mr Hemphill for chairman, re-
ported thus-
"The Bank can nevfr eq lahze exchange ttie expense of e*
change must be borne by the debtors in the debtor part of the
country, and every attempt to give a different direction to it
will be baffled "   (Report Ho of Reps Teb 27,1823)
Mr Raguet questions the utility of the Bank
dealing muchm exchanges, and both Mr Appleton
(page 34) and Mr Gallatin (on banking, pages 90
and 91) doubt whether the Bank can exercise any
thing ¡ike ihe influence which has been claimed
for it either to equalize or reduce exchanges.
It is conceded, also, that the Bank of England
has never done much in domestic exchanges, nil
some late increase, (Gilbert on Banking, p 35,)
and it is well known that merchants and bankers—
the Rothschilds, the Barings, the Hottmguers, and
the Wellses—are the more appropriate persons to
deal m affairs of this character, and, as a general
rule, deal in them qui ® as low as any United
States Bank ever did, ever can or ever will Even
the abused pet banks in 1835 did more in ex-
changes, by near twenty millions at a time, than
this boasted Unned States Bank But when we
turn to its inflated dealings—not in legitimate ex-
changes, but in transactions of that name, appa-
rently to insure greater profits thai loans on pro-
missory notes or bonds—we are struck with the
abuses to which such traffic has led.
What wj, the celebrated committee but an ex-
change committee? What were the celebrated loans
to T Biddle & Co but in part through the ex-
change committee? And what the discounts to
certain newspaper editors, but m part on bills of
exchange?
And how easy has it thus been to charge often
not only the ordinary intetesf, but a douceur or
premium—-not to call it usury—for difference in
exchange, where little or none actually existed?
Have not such facilities—not to call them extor-
tions—led some banks and some sections of coun-
try into the conversion of most of their loans into
nominal dealings in exchange, in order, by usury,
to prey more deeply on the public?
The benefit of the bank'  exchange dealings to
the Government abroad has been magnified by the
Senator from Kentucky, from a total misconcep-
tion of the facts on that subject
For several years not a singlp squadron on a
foreign station has been supplied by lunds through
foreign bills ot exchange renamed by the Govern-
ment, but all furnv-h i readily by a different ar-
rangement made in 1832 and 1833, which has
saved eight or ten thousand dollars annually from
what it used to pay for the aid of tbe United
States Bank in foreign exchanges
The wholetremittances by bills are for a fear con-
tingencies and the diplomatic corps, an<j those are
always purchased and guarantied at as low a rate
as the United States Bank has sold bills in its
palmiest days
During the entire period from 1817 to 1833 it is
also be recollected that its boasted home transfers,
through drafts and bills of exchange when made
from New York, where the revenue most accumu-
