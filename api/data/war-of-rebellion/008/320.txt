That night we lay upon our arms ready to meet the enemy at the dawn of day, and in the morning were assigned position on the extreme left of the line of battle, where we remained until ordered off the field.

This command has behaved gallantly, for during one of the most fatiguing marches, a severe battle of two day's duration without food, and a retreat of several days, the soldiers have shown a bravery, endurance, and patience that was never surpassed by any troops, and they only require discipline to make them equal to any in the world.

Colonel Stone, the adjutant of the division, was only present during the first morning of the engagement. Major Jones, the provost-marshal of the division, was detailed on special duty away from the command, and while absent was wounded.

I take this occasion to return my thanks to the staff officers of the division present in the engagement.

Captain Finney, as volunteer aide, rendered efficient service to the command.

Lieutenant-Colonel Musser, the judge-advocate of the division, had his horse killed under him the heat of the engagement, while encouraging the troops to do their duty like men.

Lieutenant Colonel W. B. Cox sustained the reputation won upon other fields, and was prompt and efficient in his duties upon the field.

Lieutenant Colonel James P. Vaughan deserves especial consideration,for whose careless indifference to danger, where duty called him, was observed by every one in the command. He never ceased to urge and encourage the men as long as the enemy held their position. His bearing was that of a true soldier and worthy the cause for which he fights so gallantry.

Dr. Grinstead, division surgeon, deserves the thanks of the command for his kindness and attention to our wounded.

Your orders were conveyed to me during the day by Celsus Price, of the Third Division, one of your volunteer aides. He was always cool and collected, so that I never mistook the order, and allow me to say that in the earnest face of the son I could see the heroism of the father.

All of which I submit to your consideration.

J. B. BLACK, JR.,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major-General PRICE.
