LEXINGTON, KY., September 11, 1864-12 m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Atlanta:

Guerrillas, under Johnston and Jessee, have been utterly routed and dispersed. Kentucky is now quiet. Leaving sufficient force on railroads, I propose to move with my available mounted forces against the salt-works in Southwestern Virginia, and desire, if it meets your approbation, that you will direct the forces in East Tennessee to co-operate with me in the movement.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

LOUDON, September 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General AMMEN:

Major Reeves reports by courier last night 12 m.: Scouts in from Crossville. No enemy there, but reported that Wheeler was killed or captured near Lebanon, Ky. His command about all gobbled; many killed. He thinks somewhat doubtful. No force can be heard anywhere near Kingston. Roads effectually blockaded.

M. L. PATTERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

LEXINGTON, KY., September 11, 1864-11 a. m.

(Received 4 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

The capture of Jessee's command leaves Kentucky nearly free from guerrillas, and the State quiet. Leaving sufficient force to protect the railroads, I propose to move with my available mounted force in a few days against the salt-works near Abingdon, Va., co- operating with General Gillem's force from East Tennessee.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, TENN., September 11, 1864.

Brevet Major-General BURBRIDGE:

Can you send your cavalry through the gap by the 15th instant? If so, what force? I can move with 1,600 men and battery. Everything depends upon celerity.

ALVAN C. GILLEM,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., September 11, 1864-10. 15 a. m.

Brigadier General A. C. GILLEM,

Bull's Gap, Tenn.:

I can be at Pound Gap with about 4,000 men on the 23d. Cannot concentrate sooner.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
