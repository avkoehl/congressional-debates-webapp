THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Johnson can tell better. I am assuming now
you did say it?
Mr. EVARTS. That you have no right to
do. Mr. J ohnson has not said so yet.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. This witness does
not say that he did not say so.
Mr. BVAIITS. That is another matter.
You have not proved it yet.
The Witness. I cannot say. He was there
on official business in reference to an officer
dismissed from the Army.
Question. Official business?
Answer. I mean business connected with an
officer dismissed from the Army.
Question. Then you were joking on this sub-
ject?
Answer. Certainly.

ble I may have seen him.

Answer. I have not to my knowledge.
Question. Now, here was a stranger who
called on you on official business, business
pertaining to your office?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Official business about getting a
man reinstated who had been dismissed?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Very good. He called upon you
On business connected with the Army?
Answer. That had nothing to do with my
office.
Question. Now, did you go to joking with
him, a total stranger, in this way?
Answer. I knew him as the lawyer employed
by Colonel Belger to get him reinstated, and
Cotonel Belger sent him to me. Now you
have got it.
Question. Was he a stranger to you ?
Ansioer. I think he was.
Question. Now, then, being a stranger, hav-
ing that fixed, will you answer did you go to
jolting with this stranger on such a subject?
Answer. Certainly. We had quite a familiar
talk when he was there. He sat with me for
some time.
Question. And that is the only explanation
you can give of that expression ?
Answer. That is sufficient, 1 think.

somebody else will judge; is it the only one
you can give ?
Answer. It is the only one I do give.

give ?

subject: did anybody talk with you about your
testimony since you left the stand?
Answer. Since I left the stand?
Question. Yes; since yesterday?
Answer. Well, I suppose I have talked with
a dozen persons.
Question. Such as whom ?
Answer. Several persons met me and said
they were very glad to hear my testimony. We
did not enter into any particulars about it. I
have been met to-day jocularly about taking
an equal drink with the Secretary of War by
two or three persons. I have talked in my own
family about it.
Question. Has anybody talked to you about
these points, or have you talked to anybody
about these points where you have changed
your testimony ?

saw the Managers, and told them wherein I
wanted

Mr. Manager BUTLER. That is all.
The Witness. I wish to make one state-
ment in reference to that very thing. I think
I ought to do it. I was called there hastily.
There were a good many events that had trans-
pired. I requested on two occasions that
committee to let me wait and consider, and
they refused, would not let me do it, jpr&ssdd
mo with questions all the time.
By Mr. Manager Butler :

Answer. When I was called before tliat com-
mittee on the evening of  
Mr. Manager BUTLER. February 26.

That was not allowed me.

articles of impeachment were there?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. That committee you mean, and
the committee was full?

was there. He was there a portion of the
time. I do not know whether he was there at
this particular time.
Question. And you tell the Senate now on
your oath that you requested the committee to
give you time to answer the questions, and
they refused you ?

until the next morning, when I could have an
opportunity to go over in my own mind those
things. It was not granted. There was no
refusal given, but I was still pressed with
questions.
