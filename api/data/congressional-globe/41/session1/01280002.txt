THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 4,
rebellion, many questions will come before it
for settlement in the next four years which
preceding Administrations have never had to
deal with. In meeting these it is desirable
that they should be approached calmly, with-
out prejudice, hate, or sectional pridef remem-
bering that the greatest good to the greatest
number is the object to be attained.
This requires security of person, property,
and for religious and political opinion in every
part of our common country without regard to
local prejudice. All laws to secure these ends
will receive my best efforts for their enforce-
ment.
A great debt has been contracted in securing
to us and our posterity the Union ; the pay-
ment of this, principal and interest, as well as
the return to a specie basis, as soon as it can
be accomplished without material detriment to
the debtor class or to the country at large,
must be provided for. To protect the national
honor every dollar of Government indebted-
ness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise
expressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be
understood that no repudiator of one farthing
of our public debt will be trusted in public
place and it will go far toward strengthening
a credit which ought to be the best in the
world, and will ultimately enable us to replace
the debt with bonds bearing less interest than
we now pay. To this should be added a faith-
ful collection of the revenue, a strict account-
ability to the Treasury for every dollar col-
lected, and the greatest practicable retrench-
ment in expenditure in every department of
Government.
When we compare the paying capacity of the
country now with the ten States in poverty
from the effects of war, but soon to emerge, I
trust, into greater prosperity than ever before,
with its paying capacity twenty-five years ago,
and calculate what it probably will be twenty-
five years hence, who can doubt the feasibility
of paying every dollar then with more ease
than we now pay for useless luxuries? Why, it
looks as though Providence had bestowed upon
us a strong box in the precious metals locked
up in the sterile mountains of the far West,
of which we are now forging the key to unlock
to-meet the very contingency that is now
upon usÂ«
"Ultimately it may be necessary to insure the
facilities to reach these riches, and it may be
necessary also that the General Government
should give its aid to secure this access. But
that should only be when a dollar of obligation
to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar
to use now, and not before. While the ques-
tion of specie payments is in abeyance the
prudent business man is careful about con-
tracting debts payable in the distant future.
The nation should follow the same rule. A
prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all
industries encouraged.
The young men of the country, those who
from their age must be its rulers twenty-five
years hence, have a peculiar interest in main-
taining the national honor. A moment's re-
flection as to what will be our commanding
influence among the nations of the earth in
their day, if they are only true to themselves,
should inspire them with national pride. All
divisions, geographical, political, and religious,
can join in this common sentiment. How the
public debt is to be paid or specie payments
resumed is not so important as that a plan
should be adopted and acquiesced in.
A united determination to do is worth more
than divided councils upon the method of
doing. Legislation upon this subject may not
be necessary now, nor even advisable, but it
will be when the civil law is more fully restored
in all parts of the country and trade resumes
its wonted channels.
It will be my endeavor to execute all laws
in good faith, to collect all revenues assessed,
and to have them properly accounted for and
economically disbursed. I will, to the best of
my ability, appoint to office those only who
will carry out this design.
In regard to foreign policy, I would deal with
nations as equitable law requires individuals
to deal with each other, and I would protect
the law-abiding citizen, whether of native or
foreign birth, wherever his rights are jeopard-
ized or the flag of our country floats. I would
respect the rights of all nations, demanding
equal respect for our own. If others depart
from this rule in their dealings with us we
may be compelled to follow their precedent.
The proper treatment of the original occu-
pants of this laud, the Indians, is one deserv-
ing .of careful study. I will favor any course
toward them which tends to their civilization
and ultimate citizenship.
The question of suffrage is one which is
likely to agitate the public so long as a por-
tion of the citizens of the nation are excluded
from its privileges in any State. It seems to
me very desirable that this question should be
settled now, and I entertain the hope and ex-
press the desire that it may be by the ratifica-
tion of the fifteenth article of amendment to
the Constitution.
In conclusion, I ask patient forbearance one
toward another throughout the land, and a de-
termined effort on the part of every citizen to
do his share toward cementing a happy Union ;
and I ask the prayers of the nation to Almighty
God in behalf of this consummation.
The oath of office was then administered
to him by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court.
The Senate then returned to their Chamber.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is
not debatable.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I withdraw it.
Mr. HAMLIN. I desire to suggest whether
we had better not wait for the organization of
the House of Representatives. We know they
are to meet.
Mr. SUMNER. But that is not to be until
three o'clock.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That is not until three
o'clock. We have been in continuous session
here to-day, and there is no necessity for our
being here at three o'clock. The Senate is
organized, and we can be informed to-morrow,
when we meet, of the organization ofthe House.
