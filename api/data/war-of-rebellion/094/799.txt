They therefore pray that such steps may be taken by the military authorities as will effectually put a stop to such unlawful proceedings or to further bloodshed; and, as in duty bound, they will ever pray, &amp;c.

WISE COUNTY, VA., January -, 1865.

Colonel B. E. CAUDILLO:

DEAR SIR: I drop you a line, informing you that my house has been pillaged and my family abused by Lieutenant A. J. Ciphers, James C. Talbert, William H. Horn, and S. P. Porter, of Prentice's command. They, in open daylight, came to my house, there being no person but my wife at the house; endeavored to take some of my bed clothes; my wife caught hold of them; they jerked her down and around, abusing her person, and in spite of her succeeded in taking off some few articles of my own manufacture. I therefore pray you that such men may be apprehended and held accountable for their conduct. This is the second time some of the same party have pillaged my house. You will please, if in your power, have something done with the party, or forward for me to the proper authorities. If we can get no protection from some source, we will be ruined by those thieves of Prentice's.

Yours, truly,

JOHN BURTON.
