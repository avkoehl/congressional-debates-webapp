About 5 p. m., having reached the intended point, we advanced in line of battle to the assault, the regiment moving in excellent order and spirit. We had not advanced far before it was ascertained that there was a considerable space intervening between Law's and Robertson's brigades, unoccupied by any Confederate troops save very few belonging to the First Texas Regiment. Near to the center of this comparatively unoccupied ground, upon a steep, rocky, rugged hill, the enemy had posted a battery of six guns, from which a destructive and vigorous fire was poured into our ranks. To cover this ground and to support Brigadier-General[J. B.]Robertson, who was pressed severely at the time, a left and oblique movement was made and continued until the Twentieth Regiment fronted this battery, when the brigade was ordered to advance forward. The order was obeyed by the regiment with promptness and alacrity, and the charge upon the hill and battery executed courageously and successfully. In the space of fifteen minutes the hill was carried, and three 10-pounder Parrott guns captured. They were brought off that night, and the next day turned against the enemy in that terrible artillery fight. Some 25 prisoners were captured and sent to the rear, some of whom aided our wounded in getting to the hospital. Three regiments, viz, the Ninety-night Pennsylvania, One hundred and twenty-six New York, and Fourth Maine, were represented in the person of the prisoners. After the enemy were driven from the hill, they poured upon us a terrific and incessant fire from the steep mountain side directly to our front, their advance line of infantry being distant about 500 yards, and pretty well protected by large rocks and stones heaped together. About 6 o'clock a regiment was moved to get to our left flank. A shot from Private John F. Jordan, of Company G, unhorsed the officer leading it, when their ranks were broken, and they retreated in wild disorder and confusion, my regiment adding no little to their panic by opening a telling volley into their scattered ranks. No other advance was attempted by them upon the hill we occupied while we held it. Our loss in the charge was very heavy. I herewith transmit a list of the casualties. *Colonel John A. Jones, commanding, was instantly killed at the post of duty by a fragment of shell when nearly half way up the hill, and but a moment before it was carried. He was an excellent officer and devoted patriot, and a braver spirit never fought beneath a flag. His loss will long be felt in this command. Lieutenant F. McCrimmon, Company H, was killed just as the regiment, gained the crest, falling literally in the arms of victory. Captain A. B. Ross, of Company A, H. C. Mitchell, of Company B, and Lieuts. P. G. Hatchett and E. J. Morgan, of Company E, were wounded; the three first-named severely, the last slightly. Shortly after nightfall, the firing ceased, the enemy employing himself in building breastworks on the mountain side in our front. By the dawn of the following day, he had constructed in plain view three lines of breastworks, which could not have been mounted without the use of scaling ladders. A fourth line, not so distinctly visible, did not appear to be so high or strong. The Twentieth held the hill until nearly 7 p. m. on the 3d, under a
