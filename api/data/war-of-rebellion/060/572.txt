Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

It is reported that the fords of the Potomac between the mouth of the Monocacy and the Point of Rocks are practicable, and left unguarded, thus opening Maryland to raids of rebel cavalry. Please see to this immediately.

General-in-Chief.

BUCKHANNON, W. VA., February 18, 1864.

General KELLEY:

SIR: We, the undersigned citizen of Upshur County, beg leave to suggest that our military force be strengthened at this place. All that we hold dear and valuable is here, and if we even desired, our effects are not portable. We learn from refugees and deserters that the enemy are preparing for a raid upon us. Therefore, in view of our exposed position, ask that you increase your force at this place.

Most respectfully, &amp;c.,

C. P. ROHRBOUGH,

Postmaster.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,February 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General HECKMAN,

Getty's Station:

We have been compelled to send Third New York Cavalry to North Carolina, leaving but two regiments on the Peninsula. I had hoped that you would be able to relieve Ledlie's brigade when you received One hundred and eighteenth and One hundred and thirty-ninth [New York] Infantry and Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry. If, however, you do not consider your positions safe, we will try and send you part of another regiment of cavalry.

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
