FRANKLIN, March 6 [7?], 1863.

General GARFIELD:

GENERAL: Our only hope of catching the enemy must depend upon Sheridan's getting behind and cutting him off. It would be well to re-enforce Sheridan by Steedman. The best thing for us is to lie still, and with our cavalry divert the enemy's attention from Sheridan's movements.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, March 6, 1863.

[General GRANGER:]

What good can you do Sheridan by lying still? The general thinks the best thing you can do to divert the enemy's attention is to attack him. How soon can you get ready? Have you opened communication with Sheridan? What help do you want?

C. GODDARD.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,March 6, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

I have just received a dispatch from Colonel Hag, who says he is halting in same position. The enemy has retired from his front. There had been heavy firing to the right of Colonel Heg's position, but it has ceased. Colonel Heg will scour the country in his front, and bivouac to-night where he now is. Colonel [F. A.] Jones' brigade is at Middleton, about 3 miles from Colonel Heg's position. Colonel Heg has opened communication with Colonel Jones.

Respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Murfreesborough, Tenn., March 6, 1863.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

Direct Colonel Heg to skirmish the enemy and drive him if he can, but be careful not to get in beyond his depth. If you deem it necessary, you may send forward another brigade to his support. Where is the brigade which went out to support Colonel Heg?

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,March 6, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Have just heard from Jones, who took possession of Middleton at 3 o'clock, after a sharp skirmishing, in which he had several men wounded. Colonel Jones awaits further orders.

Respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
