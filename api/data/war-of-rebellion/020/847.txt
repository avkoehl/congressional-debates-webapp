HDQRS. FIRST MIL. DIST., DEPT. OF S. C., GA., AND FLA.,Charleston, March 28, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Upon the receipt of the intelligence of landing of the enemy on James Island Lieutenant-Colonel Dargan proceeded to the point of Folly Island, on the StoNumbers He found three transports and one gunboat in the Stono and saw perhaps 100 of the enemy on Cole's Island; a few parties were on the opposite shore. I have no doubt that they are making a reconnaissance in some force, with a view of determining the best base of operations against Charleston by land as well as sea. Would it not be well, as the torpedo row-boats do not answer well at sea, to induce the naval commander to send them through Wappoo into the Edisto or Stono or both, and attack such force as they have in still water.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.
