Mr. Clay's Resolution—Mr. Bentort.
Senate.
been received,  calling for the recision of this or-
der    The people of the West have manifested no
opposition to the order, and it is a gratuitous as-
sumption to aver their discontent    f do not un-
dertake to say that all are for it, on the contrary,
I kriow the Opposition party to be against it, as
they are against every measure of the Republican
Administration, some persons interested m banks
are against it,  because they wish  to  make the
national  domain   a   fund  to   bank   upon,   the
speculators are all against it, because it puts an
end  to   their   speculations     These  clashes   are
against the order, but the body of the people are
for it    They lino* it to be salutary and beneficent
iu lb operation    They know it to   have been
attacked   becau e  it  was   too favorable to the
West—becauss it transferred gold and silver from
the Fast to the West—because it filled the Western
banks wit/i specie—because it made specie the
common  currency of  the people  in the Went.
They know the order to have been attacked on
these gtounds, and they know that while it in reality
cau eel specie  to flow to the Weal, it caused no
mofe  to flow ihere, and, in fact, not as much to
flow theié, as the people oí the Hiten >r are entitled
to receive out of the foreign importations and from
the coinages of our   own mints    Tbe sea port
towns are not entitled to the whole importations of
specie and to the whole coinages of the mint,  the
interior of the countiy is entukd to a shire   and
the effect of this order was to give them a share,
but by no irleans a full shaie    Gentlemen, then,
aie mistaken in averting this order to be odious in
the new States    Great efforts have been made by
politicians to render it oilioni, a political clamor has
been kept up against it, but the fart that not one
puition, no legislative memorial, except from an
Opposition State, no luters even, hive been re-
ceive ¡ apamst it, is conclusive evidence that there
is no foundation for the assertion that is here mad 
Finally, gentlemen suppose there is no reason
for excluding notes from the land office, which do
not apply with equal force to the custom?    This
ib a mistake     Theie is a great difference m the
evils df the receivabihty a* the two places, and,
while I adhere to the act oí 17S9, and ot 1800,
which made gold and silver the only currency of
the Federal treasury, and shall never consider the
Treasury sale until those acts are  re established
an 1 enforced, yet I can see manifest reasons for  I
excluding paper money from the land offices which
do not apply to the customs     In one case, there is
a limit upon the amount which can be received, in  I
the other case, there is no limit    In one there is
dangei of exciting a spirit  f speculation,  m the
other theie is none    In one you may lose  the
whole national domain, the land itself as well as
the  paper received   for  it,   in   the other  you
can lose nothing but the paper received    These
aie clear propositions which have but to be seen m
order to be felt and understood    There is no limit
to the amount of paper money which may be paid  I
at the land offices, except m the quantity of the
land, and the capacity ot the banks to manufacture
and to lend paper    At the custom houses there is a
limit    The quantity of goods imported, and the
rate of duty upon these goods, impose a limitation
upon the receivable amount of that branch of the
revenue    No more can be paid than the duties
amount to, but in the case of the lands, the sales
can go on as long as land can be found, and paper
can be manufactured    Thus, m our great fluctua-
tions in the íevenue,  the excesses and deficiencies
have chiefly occurred m the land office receipts   In
the great surplusse  of revenue which accrued in
Mr Monroe's time, the land sales were se n to rise
and fall, in le«s than three years, from l#& millions
up to twenty eight millions, and back to about one
million In the surplus reason which has just passed,
w e have seen the land sales aga.n rise from four m 1-
lionsto fifteen, fiom fifteen to twenty-five, and from
twenty-five fall back to «even    The paper rooney
buys i he  land, but it does, not buy tb° goods     If
the piper n our 900 banks could be carried to
Europe, and be paid, by force of Ian, to merchants,
and manufacturers for toreign goods, then the cases
would oe parallel there would be nohmit on the im-
portations, and none on the duties, and as great fluc-
tuations ■would occur in the custom house revenue
as inland revenue A thousandmillionsmight be im-
ported one year, and nothing the next year As
often as the right has been given by law to go and
take the public lands for paper money, juát so often
have the sales become excessive, and so it will be
again, and for ever So it has been, and so it will
be Nothing but hard money payments can impose
the proper and regular limit upon the sales which
the safety 6f the Tieasury and the welfare of the
settlers require Open the land offices to paper
money, and the Treasury becomes a balloon, now-
distended and rising above the cioüflá, then col-
lapsed, plunging to the earth, and dragged along
the ground I have mentioned this evil to gentle-
men- they could not deny it to be true, nor excuse
it, but they said it cottld be prevented by stopping
the sales of the lands Stopping the sales' as i< the
new States would submit, or ought to submit, to
such a stoppage* Error upon error, and blunder
upon blunder, Would be the hi&tory of such a stop-
page The first step is wiong, the second one
worse, and the only true course is to begin right,
and sell lands for hard money only Thin is ihe
simple and easy remedy for all the evil*, it Lmits
the sales to the amount required for cultivation, it
gives to the Treasury a uniform and regular sup-
ply, it pievents speculation, it operates as a pre
emption law in favor of settlers, it baves the land
from being plundered from the Government in ex-
change for worthless or depreciated paper, and it
helps to diffuse that gold and silver over the coun-
try, and among the people, which would otherwise
lie in masses at the import cities
The resolution of the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr Clay] consists of three parts, the first to re
semd the Ireasury Order, the fecond to compel
the universal reception of local bank notes in pay-
ment of due« to the General Government, tae
third to compel the Government to pay out the
same notes to all that will receive them
I have discussed the first of these propositions,
and have presented myself prominently in opposi-
tion to it, not m the expectation of preventing its
adoption, for I know its passage to be certain, but
to show my own opinions, and to disclose in ad-
vance some view oi the evil consequences to result
from rescinding the Treasury Order That order
will be resc nded Every body knows it will be
rescinded A bill has gone from this chamber to
the House of Representatives with a "lause to that
effect, a clause inserted b> a vote almost general
The whole current is for the lescision , but I never
swim with the current when I see it flowing upon
rocks and plunging mto a gulf That order will
be rescinded, so far as this chamber is concerned,
it is already rescinded, and there is no use m doing
the wcr'r. over again, except to gam the high honor
of k llmg ihe dead It is condemned, but it is a
wise and patriotic order, honorable to the sagacity
and courage of the Pres dent that issued it, and
one that its few friends will never be ashamed of
It had my approbation in the beginning, it has it
now, and the expenence of a few years will evince
the wisdom of its conception and the improvidence
of its rescisión
The two other branches of the resolution are yet
to be discussed, and in that discussion I shall con-
sider the two as one, for the second is only a co-
rollary of the first, and needs no enactment to give
it effect if the first shall be adopted Pass the one,
and the other follows of itself Compel th<> Go-
vernment to receive all its debts and dues in. the
paper ot nine hundred banks, and it will have no-
thing else but the paper of these banks to pay out
It must pay out that paper, or nothing, and the
public creditors must take that paper, or nothing
The Government will have nothing else to offer,
and theie will be no occasion to effect by legisla-
tion what would alieady be effected by necessity I
perceive gentlemen are disposed to shank back
irom the conditional tender which the third clause
of this resolution prescribes They shrink from
making paper money a forced tender, for it would
amount to a forced tender, under the operation of
this resolution, m all payments fr m the General
Government The author of the resolution (Mr
Clay] discover;  a disposition to relinquish it, but it
is nothing to relinquish the disbursing clause if the
receiving one is retained.   One includes the other.
What is received, must be disbursed, and gentle-
men had as well go the whole, and vote the dis-
bursing clause if they vote the receiving one I can
see no difference between the two votes, the one
implies the other. The only effect of adopting the
receiving cUrase, and rejecting the disbursing one,
would be to impose upon the Executive Depart-
ment the necessity of paying oat paper money
when Congress itself shrunk from the responsibility
of voting it
Here, them, is a proposition to compel the Gene-
ral Government to retfeive all the notes of all the
banks in the United States, chartered and unchai-
tered, created and to be created, in the payment of
all the debts and dues to the United States, and m
exchange for all the public lands which are held
in trust for the public benefit Upon what peti-
tion, and with what object, is this extraordinary
proposition piesented—a proposition which goes the
whole length of repealing the Constitution of the
United Slates, and converting her hard money
Treasury into a paper money balloon? Upon
what petition is this proposition founded? Has any
State, any public meeting, any bank directory,
asked it? Not one! Tho whole originates with a
solitary member of the Senate, unsuppoited by a
voiee in the Union for the unheard of favor which
he proposes to confer upon 900 banks Doubtless
it will be very agreeable to these banks to have
their paper made a national currency' Doubtless
it will be very profitable to them to have
their paper made a legal tender at all the land of-
fices, custom houses, post offices, and Federal court
clerks' and marshals' offices throughout the Union,
but certain it is that no one of them has had the
face to ask H' They must feel infinite gratitude
for the boon, if obtained for them, but they have
not been able to commit the impropriety of asking for
it' Reduced to its essence, and it is a proposal to the
Senate to violate the Constitution, ruin the finances,
and plundei the public creditors, and these are things
which no bank in the United States has thought
proper to ask at our hands The w hole comes for-
ward as the solitary proposition of an individual
Senator, anl bottomed upon the single assumption
that it is necessary to enable the banks to resume
specie payments To enable the banks to resume'
Strange that none of them found out that secret'
and that all the solvent commercial banks m the
United States have resumed, or have put them-
selves under pledges to resume before the first day
of January next The honest and solvent part of
the banks have resumed, or have bound themselves
to do it, and that without hoping any thing from the
aid, or fearing any thing from the hostility, oí the Ge-
neral Goveraiient They have resumed, are resum-
ing, and will resume, and no action of ours can pre-
vent them Irom doing it, much less is any action
from us required as a condition precedent to enable
them to do it The hundred banks of New York
have'resumed, the whole without exception, and all
without difficulty In all quarters of the Union the
solvent commercial banks have followed the New
York kad, either actually resumed, or declared
their determination to do so To offer these banks
aid, under these circumstances, is to perform that
service which is called post helium, auxihum, that is
to say, aid after the war It is doing what Dr
Johnson ridiculed the Earl of Chesterfield for
having done—patronised his dictxonaiy alter the
book happened to need no patron—after withhold-
ing patronage, when the book did need it No, sir,
no1 The honest and solvent banks have resumed
without asking for Government aid, and withe ut
inventing flimsy pretexts to screen themselves, or
to inculpate others. The New York banks, and
those which have followed their lead, have acted
openly and candidly, they have no need for aid, or
for pretexts If the miscalled Bank of the United
States, and her subal'erns, require aid to enable
them to resume, let them say so, and tell what
they ask If they need a pretext to cover a le-
treat fiom the non-resumption position in which
they have placed themselves, let tneir file leader
invent that pretext. Let Mr Biddle invent it An
invented pretext will answer all their purposes per-
fectly well, and if they will neither ask aid in
plain terms, nor back out from a false position
upon simulated pretexts, let them stand as they are
