HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, May 2, 1863.

Brigadier General A. E. JACKSON, Commanding Forth District:

GENERAL: I have laid your letter of the 1st instant before the major-general commanding, who desires me to say he is impressed by the insufficiency of the forces in your district, and, indeed, throughout the department, to guard all points effectually against a sudden attack of the enemy in force, and that, therefore, it has become necessary at once, after making provision to insure prompt information of the enemy's movements, to hold in readiness the main force of your district at a point from which you can move it most rapidly to meet a force of the enemy invading the department from any direction. He desires that, after detaching small infantry garrisons for defense of the bridges, your infantry forces by assembled at Greeneville, and held in readiness for instant movement, and that your cavalry forces, after making necessary detachment for patrols and pickets, be assembled at some point on or near the railroad, in the eastern part of your district. He wishes to impress upon you that tat this time the paramount consideration in all operations of the department must be the defense of it against invasion by the enemy's forces in Kentucky. Thirty or forty infantry will, in the present emergency, have to suffice as the average force for defending each bridge. Please make your arrangements in accordance with these instructions as soon as possible, and report to this office.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

D. W. FLOWERREE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, May 2, 1863.

Colonel J. B. PALMER, Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: The present disposition of your troops appears to the major-general commanding to be the best that can be made under the circumstances. By reason of your proximity to the scene of action, he will depend upon and trust their disposal to your own judgment. He will expect you to maintain your position, and to defend those in your front until he can re-enforce you. Urge upon Colonel McKenzie to be vigilant, and to report promptly anything of interest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. W. FLOWERREE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Carefully watch all his movements, so as to prevent any surprise, keeping this office constantly advised of your movements as well as those of the enemy, and, if practicable, you will advise Colonel [J. B.] Palmer, at Big Creek Gap, of any advance
