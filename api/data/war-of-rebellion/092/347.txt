CAPTAIN: *

We marched east through Decatur, passed Stone Mountain, crossed the Yellow River, through Rock Bridge to Social Circle, from Social Circle to Rutledge, a distance of seven miles. This command destroyed the Georgia State Railroad with short intervals. The destruction was thorough and complete. The ties were taken up and burned in piles, the rails laid on the piles, and bent so as to make them useless. The railroad buildings at Rutledge and Social Circle were also destroyed. The next day we destroyed about a mile of railroad with side track, at Madison; also some railroad buildings and 100 bales of cotton; marched thence southeast through Eatonton across Little River to Milledgeville, where we halted one day, crossed the Oconee River, passed Hebron, Sandersville, and Davisborough; crossed the Ogeechee River, thence through Louisville, and crossed the Augusta and Millen Railroad about three miles north of the latter place, thence to Springfield, and thence southeast toward Savannah, before which we arrived on the 10th of December, and formed line of battle on the right of the division, connecting with the Fourteenth Corps, facing east, with our right on the Georgia Central Railroad.
