this methis h^ar y cjncnrrence    But while this profession was   ¡
03teostblymd.de, it was not concealed that the direct otject of   '
the whole series of resolutions was to rai*e the tariff from   j
twenty to thirty percent, m open violation of the  very hmi
tations setby the compromise act U3elf, and in utter disre
gardofthe very conditions stipula cd   m the act, that twenty
percent should nit be exceeded, unless  the necessary exp«m
sesof an economical administration of the Government ren
dered it indispensable    Instead of a < ispo ition to adpts   ex
penses byan  economical   administration of (tie Government
below the necessi'y of transcending the express limitation of
the compromise act, these resolutims   manifested the direct
contrary disposition—hat of swelliu   the expenditures toan
amount far beyond the leal wants of th   Government
Tneoljectof all this wis to tnforce a recirrence to the old
proteuive system, which it was intended the compromise act
should put m end to The Stoat >i welt knew hat he cMr
Calhoun) never would have entered into thatcompromi-.e on
any other principle It was the clear and weH di fined
uodeftandme of all pa tie& u the u ne tha' thequeefonof pro
tei'tion should be set nt res —the wl ole system h t?me exploded
itself—an! to prevent a recurrence to it, the following guards
were agreed upon first that no duty should be laid, exrept for
revenue aid second, that at the end of the am of reduction,
twenty per cent of tariff should not be exceeded unless ab o
lute y de man led by an economical ad minish a  ion of the Go-
vernment Now, with regard to the last condition, he would
a«k what respect had been paid to it at the late extra session?
Not only was part of the resources of the Treasuiy distributed,
but instead of íetrenchments being made, improvidentappro
pn itions were authored, and a permanent debt was cieated
As a consequence of this course of imprudence and improvi
dence, a proposition is now made to raise thetaiifTírom the 20
percent tu which tne compromise act limits it after thedOth of
June next, to 30 percent as if a man were to plead a delibe
rate act of hisownextiavagancem justification of ins violation
ofas^iemn pi dge of prudence, retrenchment, and economy It
was a principle of ethico, that no man can plead hi*> jwn acts

the high taittl ■  sysu-m oí 1S23 which had filled
the TYcaury with a surplus revenue that subsequently
became the basis of wide spread banking ca¡ ital and bank in-
flations—inducing a mad intoxica ion of speculation, extrava
«anee, and recklessness, and ending m the inevitable conse

notwithstanding the opinion he had expressed m commjitee
was unchanged
On the testimony add jced against the sitting member at the
last session, the present committee came to the conclusion that
Joshua A Lowell had received 5,193 votes, Joseph O Noyes
5,080, and that there were 139 scattering votes, making ihe
whole number 10412, and requiring 5,207 for a majority and a
choice tn this state of the polls, no person having that num-
ber, there was consequently no election The £pmtmttee then
proceeded to examine the testimony on the otherside, and in
ihe progress of ihis examination came to the resolution erro-
neously, as he believed, to reject for informality thejeturnof a
plantation which gave 23 votes to Mr Noyes la the further
progress, they rejected, correctly for aught he knew, 5 other
votes given to Mi Noyes, because they were thrown by per-
sons not legally entitled to vote These decision?, deducting
23votPsfrom the poll of Mr Noyes, reduced the wholemimber
to 10 334—requiring only 5 193 for a choice. If this were the
stueof the vote, Mr JLowdll, having that number, was enti-
tled to íetain his seat
In this stage of the proceedings the majority of the commit-
tee having thus examined and decided upon all the testimo-
ny adduced a^ainscthe return of Mr Lowell and so much of
that on the other side as was in their opinion necessary to sus-
tain his right '0 a seat, adopted the resolution now before the
House, and agreed to dispense with the further examina ion of
the testimony
Now, as he did not assent to the lejection of the 23 votes m
question, he was unable to vote lor tins resolution on-so much
oí the testimony as had been examined Yet, inasmuch as
some 30 or 40 other vole* given to Mr Noyes were objected
to, and unexamined testimony was before them designed to
sustain those objections, 22 of which being sustained would
ieave Mr Lowell still entitled to his seat, he could rot tay
with certainty that the lesolution was erroneous, although from,
a hasty peiusal of the remaining testimony, he was inclined to
beheveso
Undei such encumstances, in ordinary cases, he would navo
thought it his duty to move this llouit to retommi' the case,
for tne purpose nl ha vine the leroaming testimony examined;
and failing in that, he v.uuld stil! have thought it mht to en-
deavor to sa M) the ifou^e that the decision oí the committee
was mcoirect T jat he did not íegardu as bis dut> to lake
such aomise in this case, aio-e ¡rem the belie* that the contcs-
torshai virtually, though not in loim, ie ir d fiom the contest,
u idei the mil ressu n, so i<tr as he touldjudge, that, although
they be leved Mi I owell not to have 1 a i a majority ot the
votes at the election, yet that a maj iritv of die people of the
district now wished him to «eive them for the lemamderof the
turn He w">uld state some part of the circumstances which
led him to this conclusion It was verv evident that no effort
had been made by tiiein since the last session te talte additional
testimony, oi evento perfect suüi as was then decided to have
been inloinvliy taken It m £h be, indef d thatthisw^s partly
owng as had jeen s sge'-tpd u then belief that the te  imony,
as it tiien stoid, wds&ufFicit.rit on their pan, and'hat the addi-
tional testimony on the other side was taken at so late a penod
ai not to aff id them time to meet it Be that a*? it may, tha
unusual delay d    not evince mut li zeal in the cause
Further, eevetal very respectable gentlemen from that district
who wete opposed to Mi Lowell, had been in this city during
the session, anunast them the gentleman who had received
neirlyanequ I nnmberoi votesw th him, also anablelawyer,
whowasoneof he lemonstrants, yet tie (Mr R ) had not learn-
ed that they fe tany strons i terest m the result of this investi-
gation Ceiiamit wa  that no counsel had been employed, and
ru pe.&on hid tppe- ied before the committee in their behalf
It mt<du be piopei to s> iy further, that m two other decisions
of the committee he 1 ad not been aole to concur with the majo-
rity But the points involved hiving Jeen lecs free from doubt
than the one m ques ion, and he having felt inclined to support
the sitting memo t if it could be done legally and fairly, lather
than to subject the people of the d atiict to he buiden and ex-
pense of another vote, which a majonty of them, in his opinion,
did not wish, he concluded at once to acquiesce in those deci-
siorr*, so far at least as not to trouble the House with his opi-
n on&, unless furthei cau^e ¡should aribe for tu doing
fYom suchemstderatlonche had cmne to the conclusion that
