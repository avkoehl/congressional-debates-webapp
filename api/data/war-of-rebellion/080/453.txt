Besides the working details above recorded, the whole of the Third Division was engaged at work on the redoubts on the plank road and in slashing timber around them and connecting them by breast-works. Besides these was the labor of constructing the large advanced redan on the east of the plank road, and all the main line of intrenchments occupied by our line of battle, 2,300 yards long. Much of this latter was constructed twice, owing to the advancement of the line, and bomb-proof shelters were prepared in it.
