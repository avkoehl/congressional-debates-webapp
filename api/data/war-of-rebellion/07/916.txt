HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, Ala., March 3, 1862.

Major-General POLK, Columbus, Ky.:

To fight them successfully I suggest, as the result of experience, the importance of holding your fire for point-blank range; also the importance of having all your shot and shell for rifle well greased with tallow to avoid the danger of bursting the gun.
