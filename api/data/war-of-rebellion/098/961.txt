and farther bank was found to be occupied by a considerable detachment, occupying several detached trenches on the rising ground commanding the debouche of the road. Our advanced guard was deployed as skirmishers and ordered to seek ways through the marsh considerably to right and left of the road, whilst a small party under Lieutenant Reed, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteers, attempted to pass near the road itself under cover of the tangled undergrowth of the swamp. After a brisk skirmish of half an hour a passage was effected, with 1 killed and 4 wounded, Lieutenant Reed, who showed much gallantry, being among the latter. The causeway was rebuilt to enable the Artillery to cross, the work being finished about 9 p. m. Meanwhile General Ames joined me with his division, having marched from Smithville by way of Westcott's. (See map. *) I here learned from a negro guide that a practicable, though very blind, way led between Orton and Terrapin Ponds, saving a great part of the distance by way of Russell's and reported to the commanding general that I should take that route unless disapproved by him.

On the morning of the 19th the whole force moved up the left side of Orton Pond, and on approaching the foot of it learned that Fort Anderson had been evacuated during the night and had been occupied by Moore's and Henderson's brigades at daybreak. I also received orders to send Ames' division to Fort Anderson to be put over the river and rejoin General Terry, whilst with the remainder of the forces I should follow the enemy up the west bank of the river. Pushing on rapidly, the enemy's rear guard was reached about three miles above Fort Anderson, but it made no attempt to stand until it reached Town Creek, a very deep, unfordable stream, eight miles above the fort and where a heavy line of field fortifications had been prepared some time before the evacuation of Fort Anderson. This stream, like most in this region, had marshy banks, appreway of considerable length. The timber and undergrowth had been cleared and there pieces of Artillery in the fortifications - one Whitworth rifle and two brass 12-pounders - swept the approaches to the bridge, from which the plank had been removed. The enemy's infantry force was learned to be Hagood's brigade of Hoke's division, together with the Fiftieth North Carolina Regiment, reported at from 1,200 to 1,600 men. Henderson's brigade being in advance occupied a moderate ridge some 500 yards south of the creek, overlooking the marsh, and pushed skirmishers well into the edge of the low ground. The northern bank of the creek at this point is bluff, the enemy's fortifications being immediately above the water's edge, upon a gentle elevation from twenty to thirty feet high. The enemy opened with his Artillery upon Henderson's command as it went into position, but without effect. The other brigades were kept out of sight and under cover in rear of Henderson and encamped for the night. During the night a flat-boat was discovered in the creek about a mile below Henderson's position, and on his reporting the fact I ordered it carefully secured and guarded by a strong picket, having learned that all the bridge on the stream were destroyed and that there was no ford for fifteen miles above. The situation was reported by courier to the commanding general and orders received to make use of the best means I could devise for dislodging the enemy.

Early in the morning of the 20th I ordered Brevet Brigadier-General Casement to cross the creek in the scow with his brigade and that of Colonel Sterl. Brevet Brigadier-General Henderson was ordered to
