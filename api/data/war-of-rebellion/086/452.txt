Colonel WATTLES:

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., November 6, 1864.

Major General N. J. T. DANA,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps, Vicksburg, Miss.:

GENERAL: I inclose copy of telegram from General Rosecrans. Before it was received I had sent a dispatch to him, urging that General Smith's forces and Winslow's cavalry should be sent back here, and I also sent a dispatch to Major-General Halleck to the same effect. General Forrest is in West Tennessee in force and is doing a good deal of mischief on the Tennessee River, having captured a transport and gun-boat near Fort Heiman. I have, I think, ample force to hold his place, unless Hood should strike off in this direction, but I have not a force to justify any aggressive movement or attempt to drive Forrest from West Tennessee. Of the present position of Generals Beauregard and Hood I have no reliable information. Major-General Thomas telegraphs me from Nashville on the 1st to know if I knew anything about Hood, which would seem to imply that he was in the dark. I shall not be surprised to hear of him at Corinth with most of his army, as the Mobile and Ohio Railroad is running to that point, and he can easily supply his army there. I will keep you advised of movements so far as they can be ascertained.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
