Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

If there is anything to leave in your place I want you to move southward, at least as far as some point east of Paola. Perhaps you can get the militia of Kansas City to take charge of their own garrison duty. How are matters? Can you move part or all your force forward?

HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, September 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

The general commanding directs me to say if you leave a good garrison at you post how long it take you to join McNeil and how long to reach Sedalia? Should the enemy pass between Rolla and Saint Louis and attempt to reach Jefferson City I should like to have you and McNeil's mounted force unite and harass the enemy or join Brown and oppose his crossing the Osage.
