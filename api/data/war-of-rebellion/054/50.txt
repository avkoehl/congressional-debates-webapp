Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding:

A prisoner from the Fifteenth Alabama (Longstreet) states that his brigade is all there-is in this valley. Keep a close watch on the road over Lookout, and see that no troops get over there to-day. Send me some orderlies to communicate, as the smoke renders signals impossible.

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Expedition.

OCTOBER 27, 1863-7.02 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Is the horse-boat where it can be sent to me? My men are not all across,and I am just going over. Look out for the mountain road, to keep off the rebels for a few hours. I should like a brigade to hold this bank until I get seated. Send me half a dozen orderlies.

Yours, in good spirits and without breakfast,

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Expedition.

OCTOBER 27, 1863-7.20 a.m.

General WILLIAM F. SMITH:

The enemy are moving all their troops-infantry, cavalry, and artillery-out of the valley, toward Lookout Mountain.

J. B. TURCHIN,

Brigadier-General.

OCTOBER 27, 1863-8.40 a.m.

General REYNOLDS:

We are as busy at abatis and breastworks as our supply of tools will allow. I think, to make the line quite sure, we ought to have a couple more regiments to hold the gorge and road. I really think we are tolerably secure from all attempts to retake our position. Can Whitaker get in position to drive off this battery that is trying to get our bridge?

SMITH.

The for has now cleared away, and communication will be much more rapid.

JESSE MERRILL,

Captain, and Chief Signal Officer.
