to-morrow morning and move toward Ashepoo. I have also crossed at Combahee Ferry and occupy the causeway for about half a mile from the river. There is in the works there some artillery and some militia. We will drive them out to-morrow. The troops that have been occupying the works at Salkehatchie was a brigade of South Carolina veterans, who came from Richmond. They formerly belonged to Early's army; were in Richmond a few weeks; came here three weeks ago. They marched toward Charleston, on the dirt road. A pass from a deserter states that he will rejoin his company at Adams' Run, a point between the Ashepoo and the Edisto.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
