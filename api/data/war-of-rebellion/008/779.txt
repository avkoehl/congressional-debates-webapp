MADRID BEND, March 13, 1862-11.30 p. m.

General POLK:

GENERAL: I this movement arrived from New Madrid. The enemy re-enforced and rapidly pushing their advance against our works. They have 8-inch and 24-pounders. Our gunboats are not sufficiently protected for such heavy metal. Upon consultation with Commodore Hollins and General Stewart I gave the order to evacuate the place. My boat (Mohawk) was hit in going to Fort Thompson. The enemy's batteries are not below Tiptonville. As soon as New Madrid is evacuated the commodore, Hollins, will drop down to Tiptonville and keep the river open below. As soon as I have my forces disposed to prevent the enemy crossing from New Madrid I will try and send part of my re-enforcements back. I have already organized the citizens into a police force. A large body of troops arrived to-day, supposed to be commanded by Sigel.
