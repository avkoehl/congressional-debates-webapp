Corps destroying the railroad as it advanced. The Army of the Ohio commenced the destruction of the railroad at Rough and Ready, and connected with the break made by the other troops. About 4 p. m. the Fourteenth Army Corps assaulted and carried the right of the enemy's line, consisting of the usual batteries connected by infantry parapet. The approach of night alone prevented the captured of the entire rebel force. We were now squarely upon the rebel lines of supply. The movements of our army had been so rapid that the enemy exhibited the greatest confusion, and shortly after midnight the light of the burning buildings and explosions of ammunition in the direction of Atlanta (distant twenty miles), indicated very plainly that the enemy was evacuating the place, and on the morning of the 2nd of September the Twentieth Army Corps, which has been left behind at the Chattanooga bridge for the purpose, marched into Atlanta.

In describing these operations I have gone somewhat into detail, in order that they might be clearly understood, deeming it peculiarly the province of the engineer to call attention to such brilliant maneuvers as those which enabled is to pass a river, too deep to be forded, in the very face of the enemy with a loss of less than a platoon of men, and those which placed six army corps upon the enemy's lines of communication, in position to a single corps.

In accomplishing these results the engineer department performed the following special labor, viz: Ten pontoon bridges built across the Chattahoochee River, averaging 350 feet in length, 3,500 feet; 7 trestle bridges, built out of material cut from the bank across the same stream, of which five were double tracked, and two were single, 350 feel long each, 2,450 feet; 50 miles (estimated) of infantry parapet, with a corresponding length of artillery epaulement; 6 bridges over Peach Tree Creek, averaging 80 feet long each, 480 feet; 5 bridges over Flint River, averaging 80 feet long each, 400 feet; also many smaller bridges built and many miles o road repaired. The topographical branch of the engineer department worked efficiently. Surveys were made of all the routes passed over by infantry columns, together with the lines of parapet built. A map on the scale of four inches to one mile illustrating the siege, so called, of Atlanta has been forwarded to the Engineer Bureau, in which these surveys are compiled, from the passage of Peach Tree Creek, July 9, to the beginning of the movement upon the enemy's lines of communication, August 25, and a general map, photographic copy, illustrating the entire campaign from Chattanooga to Atlanta. I have also forwarded to the bureau, a complete set of photographic views illustrating military operations about Atlanta.*

From the map department 4,000 copies of campaign maps were issued to the proper officers to facilitate military operations. I desire to bear testimony to the efficiency of the engineer officers on duty with General Sherman's army. Though all have done well yet I am particularly indebted to Captain C. B. Reese and Lieutenant Wharton and Twining.

I can only return my thanks to those officers of volunteers who did nearly all the topographical work. They did their duty and did it well. I must leave to the chief engineers of the several armies to which they belonged to do them justice.
