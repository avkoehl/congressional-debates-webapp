ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
Mr. BRIGHT, from the Committee on Finance,
reported a bill prescribing the manner of appoint-
ing the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; which
was read a first time, and ordered to a second read-
ing.
Mr. BRIGHT. I ask the Senate to consider
the bill at this time. I will state that the object of
the bill is to place the Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury on the same footing with various other
officers, whose offices are not more important than
the one he holds. The Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury is an exception to a general and import-
ant rule, without any reason in the judgment of
the " Court" for that exception.
I have before me a list of officers appointed by
the President by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, most, if not all of them less im-
portant in many respects, than the one to which
this bill relates. I will name them: Comptrollers
of the Treasury, the Treasurer of the United
States, the several Auditors of the Treasury, the
Register of the Treasury, the Commissioner of
Customs, the Assistant Treasurers of the United
States, the Commissioner, of Indian Affairs, the
Commissioner of Pensions, the Assistant Secre-
tary of State, and the Assistant Postmasters Gen-
eral;, hence the unanimous recommendation of the
Committee 011 Finance of a bill on this subject. 1
hope there will not be any objection to its present
consideration and passage.
The bill was read the second time by unanimous
consent, and considered as in Committee of the
Whole. It proposes to direct that the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury shall be, from and after
the passage of the act, appointed by the President
of the United States, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I desire to inquire of the
Senator from Indiana, when the Assistant Post-
masters General were ordered to be appointed in
the manner which it is proposed to adopt in
this case ?
Mr. BRIGHT. A provision was incorporated
into one of the general post route bills of the last
Congress.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read a third time, and passed.
NOTICES OF BILLS.
Mr. EVERETT gave notice of his intention
to ask leave to introduce a bill to regulate the
compensation of the district judge of the United
States for the district of Massachusetts.
Mr. JOHNSON gaVe notice of his intention I
to ask leave to introduce a bill to amend the act j
creating the western judicial district of Arkansas.* j
Mr. HUNTER gave notice of his intention to i
ask leave to introduce a bill to extend the ware- i
housing system, by establishing private bonded
warehouses, and for other purposes.
BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. G-WIN, according to previous notice, asked
and obtained leave to introduce a bill to establish
a line of mail steamers from San Francisco to
California, via the Sandwich Islands, to Shanghai,
in China; which was read a first and second time
by unanimous consent, and referred to the Com-
mittee on the Post Office and Post Roads.
Mr. ADAMS, in pursuance of previous notice,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill to re-
duce and graduate the price of the public lands;
which was read twice by its title, and referred to
the Committee on the Public Lands.
Mr. FISH, in pursuance of previous notice
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill to re>
imburse the common council of New York city 
for expenditures made for the first regiment of
New York volunteers; which was read twice by
its title, and referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs.
BANK NOTES IN DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA.
Mr. ADAMS, according to previous notice,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill to pre-
vent the issue and circulation of notes of a less
denomination than five dollars within the District
of Columbia; which was read a first time, and
ordered to a second reading.
Mr. ADAMS. I desire to ask that the bill
may be read a second time, with a view to its
reference. Before doing so, however, I wish to
state that my object in introducing it is only to
meet the cases embraced by a bill introduced by
me at the last session, to prevent the issue and
circulation of notes of a less denomination than
five dollars in the District. On my first visit here,
I found a general complaint in reference to the
circulation of small notes. There seemed to be
no difference of opinion, except as to the nature
of the corrective to be applied. I have learned
recently that legislation is increasingly demanded
in regard to larger notes than were embraced in
that bill. A difference of opinion, however, exists
in regard to that matter. A bill was brought for-
ward at the last session by my friend from New
York, [Mr. Pish,] which I expect he will bring
forward again, in regard to free banking in the
District. I have drawn up and presented the
same bill which I introduced at the last session,
which was referred to the Committee on the Dis-
trict of Columbia. I ask that it may be again
referred to the same committee.
The bill was read a second time, by unanimous
consent, and referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia.

Mr. DAWSON offered the following resolu-

port ol' entry at Krnnswick, in the State" of Georgia.
