did not fire. Major Campbell, commanding artillery, Section 2, reports that about 8.30 p. m. an alarm occurred, the picket-boat off Haskell having come in and reported the enemy's barges approaching. The proper signals were promptly made, and the troops of the post immediately ordered out and put in position, and kept on the defenses until 3 a. m. One gun (24-pounder howitzer) and one rifle by a sentinel were fired off at Tatom at a raft supposed to be a boat. Nothing further unusual occurred, except several reports of small-arms in the direction of the Secessionville bridge. Colonel Graham, commanding Secessionville, reports that at about 9 o'clock the officer of the day reported three rockets sent up in the direction of Battery Haskell, which being the signal that place was threatened, the command at this post was turned out and under arms; the several guns manned. Having been notified that all was quiet at Haskell, I dismissed the command, with directions to sleep with their accouterments on. At about 10 p. m., musketry firing was reported at the battery between the two bridges at this post, and that two boats had approached that point. Upon investigating the matter I than a collection of marsh grass floating about with the tide, which at the time was at its flow. Besides this, I have no operations to report at this post for the 8th instant.*
