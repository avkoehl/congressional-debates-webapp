Do not keep the troops waiting for the ammunition. Let them go over to John's Island without delay. Send the ammunition over as soon afterward as possible.

Will see in the morning whether there are any in his department, and send them over.

Owing to strong position occupied by enemy, after consultation, General Robertson will make a rear movement early in the morning. Enemy's present position is flanked by impenetrable swamps, and his front guarded by causeway. All quiet now.
