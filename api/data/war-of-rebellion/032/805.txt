ment has been made by a request of General Grant.* I hope you will approve. My instructions were full of caution, and will be pursued. Further information from General Bluff informs me that Marmaduke retreated to Van Buren, where he joined Hindman, their joint force being about 20,000. Blunt took two pieces of disabled artillery. He remains at Cane Hill.

Major General SAMUEL R. CURTIS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: My scouts just arrived report Hindman and Marmaduke concentrating their forces, 25,000 strong, at Lee's Creek, 25 miles from this place on the route to Van Buren, and 15 miles from the latter place, and I expect an attack to-morrow morning, but shall not abandon my position without a fight. I have requested General Totten to re-enforce me by forced marches on the Fayetteville road, but I have no knowledge of his present locality, and have got to hunt him up.

Respectfully,

JAS. G. BLUNT,

I desire you to move as much of your force as possible, especially the infantry, to my support, as I do not intend to leave this position without a fight. You should move by forced marches via Fayetteville, and keep me constantly advised of your position and movements. Answer by telegraph to Elkhorn as soon as you receive this.
