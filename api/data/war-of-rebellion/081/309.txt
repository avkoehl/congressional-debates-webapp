Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you make every arrangement for attacking with your whole corps, and attack at 7 o'clock or as soon as you are ready. General Wright has received similar orders and is directed to keep his right well closed on your left and to throw round his left.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Similar instructions sent to General Wright.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 22, 1864-7.25 p.m.

General MEADE:

General Gibbon, on the right, moved to the attack 7.05 p.m., with what success not yet ascertained. General Barlow, on the left, advances next and will be ready in a few minutes. He attacks with a heavy skirmish line, this being the only practicable order from the defenses of the wood in his front. General Mott follows General Barlow immediately in his attack. He attacks in the same order. General Barlow has this moment attacked.

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 22, 1864-7.45 p.m.

General MEADE:

General Gibbon found the enemy too strong for him in his attack, but is about trying it again. The left, under General Barlow, in its advance has as yet met with little opposition and by the cheering indicates possession of ground previously held by the enemy. General Mott is actively engaged. The Sixth Corps is not as yet on the right, where its line meets the Second Corps. It is now dark.
