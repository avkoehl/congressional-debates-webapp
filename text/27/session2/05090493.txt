CONGRESSIONAL GLOSÉ.

in the affirmative The check was delivered for the amountcf
the fine and costs; and the General's aid placed the amount in
bank to meet it. The General, therefore, paid the whole from
his own pocket The ladies of New Orleans undertook to re
fund it j but the General refused to receive the amount which
they raised, and it wasturned over to some charitable purpose
This answered the objection as to the payment of the money
'On the other point—the application lor the restoratign of the
money it is true that there is do foimal petition from the Gen-
eral asking font; but there is evidence here that he does ask
for it, not for the sake of the money,but for the sale of the con
damnation of the sentence which the restoration implies Mr
B then quoted a few words from the postscript of the General's
letter, in which he adverted to this fine, aa inflicted by Judge
Hall, as constituting the only censure now o i the records ol the
Country against him, and which he wished to see erased before
his eyes were closed upon the scenes of this life This, said
Mr B,answersthe other point, andshows that this proceeding
is in conformity to the General's wishes and feelings
Mr. B said he was glad to seethattheobjecuonsmadetothia
bill were slight in themselves, and temperately urged, and taken
up by all as a case, not of money, but of justice and feeling
The General cares but little about the money He has shown,
all his life, that he only valued money for I'suses, and ma very
little time he wdl have no use tor any more of it lie showed
that he placed but little value on the thousand dollars, at the
«me the fine was imposed, for he refused to permit others to
pay it for him, or to refund it to him It is not as an acquisition
of money that he wishes this restoiation but as a condemnation
of the judgment under which it was paid, and as an erasure
from the records of the countty of the c nsuie which it implied
This is the aspect which the case wears, and under which it
seems to be viewed by the Senalois who have spoken The le
gality, the justice, the propriety of the fine, is the question,
and on this point there is but little room foi diversity of opinion
There are two cases m wh'ch a public officer, military or civil,
hasa right to be indemnified for losses sustained in the execu
tion of nisduty the firstcase, that of theillegaliiy oí the ]udg
ment against him, the othei, that of a mistake m the officei,
While in the conscientious dischaige oí duty On either of
these grounds, officers are entitled to a restoia ion of what they
may have paid, and, surely, on the latter of these grounds, no
one could doubt No one can doubt that General Jackson,
in, saving the city of New Oi leans, and in doing what he did to
save it, was actuated bv no othei feeling but that of patriotic de
votion to his country, unalloyed by a particle of ill will, re
venge, or malice, to any human hems? On this point, theie is
no diversity of opinion, for, independent of thegeneialcucum
stances of the whole defence, there is special evidence of ah
sence of all ill will to Judge Hall on this occasion, in the nob e
manner in which Gen Jackson mtei posed to protect the Judge
irona the exasperation of the surrounding crowd On this point,
the restoration of the fine becomes an act of justice, without
impeachment of the legality of the sentence But the othei
poiot is clear and indisputable m this case The conduct of the
General was legal—that of the Judge illegal And this was fully
eh«wn in the legal view of the case winch was taken by the
Senator from Ohio, [Mr Tappan ] on presenting the resolutions
from the Legislature of his own State, which gave n«e to this
bill Legal disquisitions are tedious here, and would be still
more so, when they are repetitions The speech of the Senator
from Ohio remains unansweied, and from that speech the ille
gality of the sentence which imposed the fine is clear and unde
iriiable The fine was illegal It was imposed by animlated
Judge, fora supposed contempt of his own authority No jury
trial intervened That great bulwaiic of the liberty, the life the
property of the citizen—the bulwark of jury tnal—was not re
sorted to General Jackson was not placed befoi e a j uiy o{ his
countrymen He stood before a judge, irritated, acting in bis
own case, and acting alone He believed the Judge wa& acting
illegally and tyianmcally But he was ajudge—a judicial ofh
cer, sitting on the judgment seat, and the victorious General
gave a noble example of submission to the laws, by submitting
to thesentenceof this Judge He paid the money, he pi itected
him from the ebullition of the popular feeling, he showed that,
with us, arms are silent m the presence of the laws And now,
every consideration of justice and right requires us to reverse
the sentence, and to expurge thecen=uie which it implies, by
passing the bill which reotores the money
The debate, which was of great length and of an mteiesting
character, and which will be published hereafter, was continued
by Messrs. KING, BUCHANAN, LINN, and WOODBURY,
in favor of the bill, and by Messrs CRI1TENDEN, PRES
TON, MA(fGUM, and BERRIEN, in opposition
Mr CONRAD obtained the floor, but gave way for some
explanations between Messrs BERRIEN and BUCHANAN
after which, the question pending was on motion to recommit
the bill, but the hour being late,
Mr TALLMAÜGE observed that he thought there had been
glory enough for one_day, and mjved an adjournment
The Senate then adjourned

Mr FILLMORE rose and asked the Home by unanimous
consent, now to take up and dispose ot the leport transmitted
on aformerday by the becretaiy oí the iiea^mj, on the ^ub
ject of the tariff, and then tempoiaruy laid on he ubi , at nis
<Mr F 's) suggestion, under the apprehension 'bat a debate
would arise upon it Probably, however, it might now be dis
po^edof without much dibcu&stun
The SPEAKER     What motion does the gentleman submit?
Mr FILLMORE said he felt bound to make the motion that
Uie report berefeired to the Committee of Ways and Means,
although a veiy able leport on the same subject had been made
by the Committee on Manufactures He wished, however, to
test the sense of the House on this motion, to see whether they
desired any further action on the part of the Committee of
Ways and Means Individually, he should prefer that action
should not be imposed on the cot mittee Nevertheless, theie
was no member oi that committee who w as disposed to retreat
from the dufy, if the House should think it necessary to impose
it upon them                                                                                     ¡
He therefore submitted the motion of leference to. the Com    '
mutee of Ways and Means, for the purpose of having the
opinion of the House whether they required the action of that
commit'ee upon it oi not
Mr  EVERETT moved that the íepoit be referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
It wat> very nnpoitant(Mi E said) that the House should
act on this subject soon The jelerence to the Committee of
Ways and Means must, he believed, delay action Upon the bill
It would be recollected that, unless some measure was passed
befoie the 1st of July, according to the opinion of the Secretary
of the Tieisury, no dutits could be collected under the piesent
tariff It was, therefore, of the utmost impoitance that the hi J
should be speedily acted upon, and foi this leason it was that
he moved the refeience to the Committee oí the Whole on the
state of the Union
Mr WARREN said 11 seemed to In m that t hi¡> measure could
be only amea&uieof levenue, that thete was nothing that could
lustify this imposition of duties on impoits but the wants of the
i.)vemment If the Government wanted no monev, it would
oe unoeeessaiy to refer the ¡sitbjeet to any committee, but, us
the Government wanted money, acill had been made on the
Secretary oí the Tieasury for a plan to be submitted to this
House, wlinli wis to hive no particulir object but revenue—
first the amount of ie\enuethat was necessary, and, secondly,
what was the best modo of raising that amount It ceemed to
him that the subject ought ceiumly to go to the committee
piopeily chaigcd with the subject of ian n¿ levenue That
committee was the Committee of Ways and Means The sub
ject had always been referied to them If there had been any
deviation fiom that course, it did not at this timo occur to him
Mi W lefened to the acti >n taken on this subject in the
eaily part of the session, and to the fact of its reference to the
Committee on Manufactures That committee had i ever been
charged legitimately with devising the ways and means to ¡>up
ply the wants of the Government, but had beui considered
merely as the particular lepiesentative of the manufactuiing
mtere&ts of the country Their leport, so far afc.be could judge,
was made with a view to those mteiests md not with a view to
the revenue oi the wants of the Government Now, it was pro
pobedbytheg ntleinan fiom Veimont [Mr E\erbit] to reftr
the report of the Secretary oí the Treaeuiy, submitting a plan
for revenue, not to any committee whose piovmce it was to m
vestigate th it subject, but to the Committee of the Whole on
the «uate of the Union, to whom had been lefcied, for investí
gation and discussion, the bill reported from the Committee on
Manufactme  Could the Committee of the Whole on the s'atc
of the Union investigate this, mattei as it was pioper that it
should be investigated? Not so The ques ion simply wa ,
whether the wants of the Government weie to be considered, oi
the wants oft e manufacturing interests For what puipose
was the taxirg power given? It was given f^r the purpose of
raising the means necessary to cairy on the Government, and
to enable it to discharge all its legitimate objects, and not to
give protection, or for any otherpuiposes There always had
been a committee whose especial duty it was to take in o con
sideration what the particular wants of the Government weie,
and to repon upon them 1 hat committee was the Committee
of Ways and Means
It seemed to him that if the wants of the Government, and
the amount necessary to meet those wants, were to be consid
ered at all, they were subject matter  which ought to go to the
Committee of Ways and Mean1? that they might report a rev
enue measure It would then be submitted as a revenue
measure, and it would be detei mined whether a revenue meas
lire was to be adopted, or a measure to protect particulai in
teres's, or whethei the two could be so reconciled as to meet
the mtuesls of all, and still give sufhuent revenue to the Gov
eminent He wa¡¡> in favoi of the leference to the Committee
of Ways and Means Let that committee report a system oí
revenue to the House, showing, first, the amount necessary f i
the wants of the Government, and, secondly, a mt de by which
that amount shall be raised

So the House refused to refer the report to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union.
And the question recurring on the motion of Bit* Tiumqre,
to refer the report to the Committee of Ways and Mearte—
Mr ROOSEVELT rose to move to amend the motion bf add-
ing the following words
' With instructions to examine ihe same and particular'
ly to ínquue and report whether any of the rates tff duly
therein recommended aic not so high aa to produce a reduction
instead of an increase of the revenue which will be derived
therefrom "
Mr EVERETT objected that the instructions were not m
order, and added that he considered thg last vote as equivalent
to a declaration that we were to have no tariff act passed before
the 1st of July
The SPEAKER decided the instructions to be out of order
the previous question having been ordered, and applying
still to the motion of reference to the Committee of Ways and
Means
And the question being taken, the report was referred to the
Committee of Ways and Means
GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion of Mr TILLMORE, the House resolved itself
into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
Thompson of Indiana in the chair,) aud íesumed the consid
ration of the amendments made by the Senate to the bill ma-
king appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of
Government for the year 1842
When the committee rose last evening, the state of the ques
Hon was as follow
The amendment of the Senate to strike out the appropriation
"foi outfit of a charge d'affaires to the Republic of Ntrw Gren
ada $4,500," and to insert "foi outfits of charges des aJTaiies
to bvveden, Belgium, and New Grenada, and half outfit to
charge d'afTaues to Holland, $15,750," being under considera
tion—
Mr Adams had moved to amend the amendment of the Sen*
ate, by giving a full outfit to th< charge to Holland
An! the pending question was on the amendment of Mr.
Adams
Mr T R INGERSOLL rose and said I lose just before the
adjournment yesteiday, Mr Chairman to lnquneof the gen
tlenian fiom Massachusetts whether the motion he had made
to eive the chaige d'affaires to Hull and a full outfit had been
considered by the Committee on Foi eifn Affairs, and received
its sanction I take the Ubertj now to ask for inforraationoa
that point
Mr ADAMS replied that tbe Committee on Foreign Affairs
hnd author zed him to in ike the motion He observed, how
evei,that it was but candid to=tate mat one of the members (the
gentleman fiom Georen) opposed the measure
Mr I R INGERSOLL pioceeded '1 he only possible dif
ficulty in the way of the amendment must be loujid m a very
s'net constiue tion of an act of Congress of 1810, Which makes
it lawful to allow an outfit to a minister or charge, on going
from the United States to a foreign country In extreme
stuctness of construction, this would not interfere with the
gentleman m question, foi heisnow m this eountry onleave of
absence, and will actually go from the Urn tea-Si a tes to hie new
duties The meager estimate of half an outfit (let it be ob-
served) ah eady distrusts the letter of the law, as much as if it
had been an estimate for a full one It construes the act ex-
actly as the amendment does Every thing except strict con
strucfon being at ill events^t variance with the difficulty, I
considei there 1= quite enough io enable us to overcome it
We have had, it seems the*regular previous inquiry by the
ptoper committee    The proposition will thus come before the
House, alter having undeigone official scrutiny    This is not
conclusive upon us, but it is a circumstance entitled to respect
and considei ation    It appears, besidef, that we have what may
be  íegaided as settled piecedent anjl authonty     A uniform

not, indeed, carry us back to the reign of ti e First Richard, but
he reaches a time, to thecontiary of which, as the lawjeissay,
memory doth not run    We have, however, what is better than
official sanction and piecedent cdmb ned, without which pre-
cedent and official sanction ought not perhaps to ptevail—we
have sound reason and justice; m favor of the motion    It is
not easy to understand, upon any principle, why a distinction
should be made between the case of a person removed from one
