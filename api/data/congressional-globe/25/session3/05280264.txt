suffer me to say that the first development of such
a system has more than immortalized the pen that
drew the memorable ordinance of 1785. Thither
we trqpe the origin and foundation of all our sub-
sequent legislation on the important subject of the
public domain, and to the bold conceptions which
gave birth to that system, with its posterior im-
provements, the nationf and the people are mainly
indebted for the silent but secure operations of
laws preventing impositions, and foiever remov-
ing the distressing evils of conflicting titles Un-
like any of the new States, Kentucky, perhaps,
excepted,Tennessee never enjoyed the ad vantages
of this system The early laws of North Caro-
Una, the peculiar character of the obligations cre-
ated by the gieat military donation to whieh I
Iteve already adverted, and the engagements of
Congress, undei the cession of 1790, to respect
and observe all existing stipulations, dented my
State these advantages North Carolina had

ifient of the Resolution, it was, in fact, coeval
with the first settlement of the colony, suited at
first to the perilous condition ot the country, and
m a long succession of years accommodating itself
to the popülai will, it grew with her giowth, and
strengthened with her strength
With us, sir, m the security and the improve-
ments of the age, a survey always precedes the
entiy and appropriation of public lands Undei
the old )é°itne of all or most of the States and
colonies, the entry had piecedence, and the
" wanant " foi the survey was issued after the
claimant had selected his ground, and deliveied
its locality to the pioper officei of the Govern-
ment, a grant followed the survey, and the title
was perfected Aftei the military donation, sir,
the " wan ant "^-a teim technically used to de
scribe a State certificate for vacant lands—pre-
cedes the right to enter and appioprmte Sir,
this new instiument was a "caite blanche," so
to speak, for its amount in acres upon all the va-
cant terntoiy of a State set apart for* the officers
and soldiers of the Revolution The holdei of
the "warrant" went forth into the forest in
search of soil, confined to no lines, and restucted
by no suivcys, Unless it might be the lines and

Every inch ofground, with every tree and coveit,

banan foe, and it not unfrequcntly tuined out
that the soldiei who had periled life in evei y form
for his wanant, aftei wards lost it in the rash
effort to secure a home to his liking Mr Pres
ident, may I not appeal to you for a thousand
facts in proof of this assertion' Yes, sir, you
have "trod the wine pieas," and will testify to
the probable tiuth of my stoiy Su, in those
days, the dangers of which I am speaking reached
the lonely cabin of the peaceful settler as well as
the more hardy adventurer of the woods Men

their backs, ami how often has it not happened
within the morning and the evening of the same
day, in the life and death of its best and only
defender, that the house of joy has been turned
into the house of mourning
Mr President, the pieceding details, tedious
and uninteresting as they may he, are necessaiy
to the just elucidation of my subject They lead
the mind to an easy comprehension of a topic oth-
erwise not a little complicated, and enable Sena-
tors to grasp both the justice and propriety of
sanctioning the provisions of this measure
Sir, the year 1783, memorable for other great
events, is further signalized in the history of my
story as the epoch in which the State of North
Carolina gave an honest but baneful form to the
beneScent provisions of the " act for the relief of
the officers and soldiers of the Continental line "
It was declared-
"That each and every person or persons entitled to land
by virtue of the atore«aid law shall, on application to the
Secretary of State, obtain and revive *rom him a warrant
of survey for such quantities of land within the limits of
the lands reserved b> the aíoreeaid law for said ofbeers and
soldier", bo, she, or they, by the ¿foresaid law, shall be en
ütled to, which «hall be directed to Colonel Martin Arm.

strong, who is hereby-appointed surveyor for that purpose,
and ¡a authorized and required, by Himseli or deputy to
execute and return the same into the Secretary's office
within the same tune and in the same manner as is required
in other cases '
Sir, these loose and unguarded provisions, con-
sistent, nevertheless, in many respects, With the
antecedent practice of this State, constituted the
fruitful source of incalculable mischiefs, and in
their consequences, have swallowed up, at last,
the entire valuable portion of the rich domain I
have endeavored to pencil
In the science of political economy, as in me-
chanics and every other art and science, fiist at-
tempts are generally rude, defective, and ímpeí-
fect, untaught by lessons drawn fiom experience
and mellowed by practice, the mind of man too
often wanders into absurdities, and, in its best
intended efforts, gives sad proofs of the utter
weakness of all human sagacity Who among
men has not looked back in íepentant shame and
regret upon some deed of short-sighted policy
which self-sufficiency had at one time vainly dig-
nified by the líame of wisdom' And thus it is
that time, which, in its blow but certain progres-
sion, tests all things, frequently compels us, while
we may consecrate the motive, to deploie the
mischiefs of hasty and unguarded measures, and
a signal proof of this is to be found in the benev-
olent law from which I have just given you a
shoit quotation Unaided by any counsels save
his own, unchecked by the supervision of some
watchful eye, untrameled by any particular obli-
gation other than the ever doubtful molality of the
best among mankind, in an hour of temptation—
is it at all to be wondered at that, in the execution
of such a law, vast and incalculable frauds should
have been peipetrated by the negligence or con
tnvance of a secretary, or by the villainies of
those who had the confidence of his office ' Sn,
since the passage of the law, how many million
acies of land wairants have issued, no man can
count Like the heads of the fabled bydia, they
have multiplied as they weie stnken on , and, to
this day, if you had any valuable terntoiy left,
I feu you would have no light to hope that any
modem Hercules had appealed to destroy the
Leinean monstci Yes, sir, they came upon us
like the locusts of Egypt, settling down upon the
land, and devouung every gieen thing befoie
them Swarm followed swaim in quick sueces
"¡ion, until, having oveirun the " mihtaiy reser
vation,"and( xhaustedthe whole terutory "noith
and east of the line," they swept away ovci the j
livpis and the hill&, and, lighting down on the
lands of Congress, have coveied almost every
acie of valuable public domain within the limits
of Tennessee
But let me not 15c understood, Mr President, in
this hasty but faithful sketch of facts, as intend-
ing the least censuie upon the Legislature oi the
people of North Caí olina In all that I have said,
and in anything I may say, nothing is more dis-
tant from my feelings than unkind aspersions on i
either. Sir, the government and the people of
that noble old State, in common with the authoi-
Uies of Tennessee, have lamented abuses neither
of them could remedy The evil, great and de-
stiuctive as it has been, found its origin in the
unguarded provisions of the act of 1783, and us
principal consummation within thefiistfewyeais
of the administration of that law
Turning, sir, from this general view, I beg Sen-
ators to accompany me in a nearei approaeh to
the subject, and I propose, sir, to bring up an
array of facts which, I persuade myself, must
carry conviction to every unprejudiced mmd,and
seal the success of the bill under discussion I
invite you, sit, to open the map of Tennessee
Placing your eye upon a point in the south boun-
dai y of the State whei e it is mtei sected by " Elk
river," running noi th to the immediate neighbor-
hood of Columbia, thence westwaid with Duck
river and the military line to the Tennessee, and
down this last i iver to the Kentucky line, you cut
west Tennessee proper into two great divisions
With the terntoiy lying east and north of this
line, and stietehmg off to the mountains, we have .
now nothing to do More than thirty yeais ago
it was abandoned by Congiess, and has long since 1
fallen a piey, in all its valuable poitions, to the |
insatiate element it was vainly designed to satisfy
Since the compact of 1806, between Congiess, I
Senate.
Worth Carolina, andTennessee, the territory south
and west of the line I have just now described
has been familiarly called by its descnptiv title,
" the congressional reservation " It contains the
onljr Government domain lying within the limns
of Tennessee, and by an accurate estimate falls
short of seven million acres of land
But again subdivide the " congressional reser-
vation" by the line of the Tennessee river, in its
whole length through the State, and you have two
sections of very unequal aieas—not more un-
equal, howevei, than they are dissimilai in soil,
surface, and topography With the exception of
the east and northeast portions, the whole face of
the subdivisions lying on the east of the Tennes-
see river istiaversed by a waste of unfruitful hills
and steep declivities, separated by deep and nar-
row valleys Thiough the largest portion of this
region natuie,forthe most part, wantons in naked
poverty, the scant and flinty soil mocks the hopes
of the husbandman, and defies his hardest toils.
A thin and scattered population breaks at times
the dull monotony of the woods, or, it may be
that the eye of the traveler, weary in seaich of a
smoke fiom some lonely cabin, lights at last upon
the fire of some modem Nimrod, and under the
hospitable tent of the hunter accepts the best and
only íefuge the forest affbids him Sn , honor-
able gentlemen can form some idea of the char-
acter and value of these lands if they will be
pleased to turn to the documentary proof lying on
their tables
On the testimony of the public surveyoi1?, (who,
to my knowledge, are men of piobity, and inti-
mately acquainted, I dare say, with every pait of
the country,) there were, in the yeai 1828, one
million five hundred thousand acres of vacant and
unappiopnated land lying within the particulai
section of which I am now speaking Of these,
not more than one hundied thousand acies weie
valued at the inconsidei able sum stipulated in this
bill All the balance were woithless—utteily poor
and woithless In the woids ot one of the wit-
nesses, all the valuable lands in his dibtuct had
been enteied, " those loinainnijj vacant weie of a
veiy mfeiior quality, lying in small detaclud pai
eels, bcattcipd eveiywhi ie,in vinous shapes and
foims, he did not know of a tiact of fifty acies
of good vacant hnd in one body within I lb dib-
tuct, as most gencially pieces of vacant land fit
for cultivation lie in «mall tiacts of five to twenty
acres suirounded by hills or lands not woith the
taxes " In tht language of another witness,
equally competent and credible, the lands in ques-
tion are the " pooi'est within the reservation "
"There remains," he adds, "aveiy small por
Hon worth the expense of piocunng a patent,
those winch might be considoied fit foi cultiva-
tion he only on watei courses and in nai row slips,
and might be pui chased ata small pi ice, foi the
sake of the timl í r, by the owneis of contiguous
lands " To speak in the stion^ and emphatic
expressions of this witness " ill the lands in this
district, except such as lie on the watei eouises,
are altogethei stenle and unfit fot culhiation "
Mi President, if this be a faithful pietuie of
the legion ovei which I have just glanced so has-
tily, what shall be said of the othei great section
of the " congiessional reservation >" In thatex-
tensive countiy lying between the Tennessee and
Mississippi rivers, theie are seventeen counties,
many flourishing towns, villages, and hamlets,
and a wealthy, dense, growing, and intelligent
population Sixteen years ago it was little better
than a wilderness Occupying less than a fourth
of the whole map of the State, it numbers, at this
day, more than a third of our entiie population
Two members of Congress provide for its inter-
est in an opposite wing of this Capitol, and it is
represented in the State Legislature by eighteen
members—Senators and Representatives In con-
templating this beautiful country, its comparative
geological peculiarities strike us with the gieatest
surprise and astonishment Inteisectmg, in its
couise both the south and north boundary lines
of the State, the channel of the Tennessee rner,
within that cncuit, seems to have searched out
and swept around the extreme verge of our lime-
stone formation Beyond its left bank, webtwaid
to the Mississippi, scaiceastone oi a pebble is
to be found, and, with slight vaiieties, in the east
and" southeast coiners, this great section, turn
