EDWARDS DEPOT, May 6, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

According to your instructions, I started for Grand Gulf by way of Willow Springs, but found the enemy in possession of the road, and turned back and started for Hall's Ferry, on Big Black. Getting within about 2 miles of the ferry, I met with a party of 4 scouts, and soon discovered the enemy's cavalry. They charged and routed me. I have 13 men MISSING, but think only a few are killed or captured. On the 4th, my advance was fired into by a party of our own men, wounding 4. I captured 3 Federals near Grindstone. My horses are broken down. Sent 9 back to Jackson. What are your orders?

W. L. CROMWELL,

Lieutenant, Commanding Detachment.
