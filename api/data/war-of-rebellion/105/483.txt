the presence of the dragoons might alone prevent such a scene; still, on the first occasion of showing this flag I do not anticipate difficulty. The violet party is not yet strong. Success will make it stronger. The native Californians will take the strong side. Those of them who have taken sides are with the violent party. The Union men, irrespective of party, are organizing here, and I think will soon be formidable enough to control matters-certainly until there is a great change in political matters on the Atlantic side, or until direct taxes for the support of the war be levied, probably then also.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

Los Angeles, Cal., May 12, 1861 - 8 p. m.

Major W. W. MACKALL,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: There was no trouble here whatever to-day. Having failed to do what they had promised to do, I have no anxiety for the future. Those intending to parade here to-day thought better of it. The fact is, their principal advisers, or those to whom the turbulent spririts looked to for countenance, have found that they were being compromised in an affair for which they were not prepared. The Union men have been quite busy during the last few days in organizing for the purpose of commanding order, and have found their numbers so formidable that, together with the moral effect produced by the reported proximity of troops, they have but little fear for the future.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

CAMP AT WARM SPRINGS RESERVATION, OREG.,

May 12, 1861.

Major W. W. MACKALL,

Asst. Adjt. General Dept. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding the department, that a few days ago a party of eighty warriors from this reservation returned from the Snake country, where they had been to recover horses stolen from them by the Snakes at various times during the last year. The party had byt small success, only having recovered some twenty horses. They took prisoners Po-li-ni, a noted chief, and seven of his men, but unfortunately they were all released on their promise to return on the morrow with all their people. The captives were not seen again. From information obtained from the Snake themselves I am of opinion that no fears need be entertained of an attack being made by the Snakes on the agency during the summer. All the reservation Indians have removed with stock to the fisheries on the Columbia River. The presence of even a smaller force than that now here, and of any arm, would effectually prevent an open attack. Petty thefts can only be prevented by the presence of so large a force that occasional scouts could be made to the nearest Snake
