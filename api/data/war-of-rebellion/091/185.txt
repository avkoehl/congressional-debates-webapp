CUMBERLAND, September 26, 1864.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

General Crook does not approve of calling out the militia. You will therefore please cause the force recently called for by me to repel the threatened invasion of Upshur and neighboring counties to be disbanded.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., September 26, 1864. (Received 7.30 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

The rebels are in Weston; force unknown. A bogus operator is at work on the line.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., September 26, 1864. (Received 8.15 p. m.)

Major-General KELLEY:

I understand that the Seventeenth Virginia, or some other troops, started from Wheedling to-day. Please direct them here temporarily. The bogus operator says the rebels under Colonel Duke, 3,000 cavalry and a large regiment of infantry, are within four miles of Weston, W. Va.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CUMBERLAND, September 26, 1864-8.15 p. m.

Colonel WILKINSON,

Clarksburg:

Concentrate all the force you can at Clarksburg at once. Have you any militia? Have you heard from Buckhannon?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CLARKSBURG, September 26, 1864.

Major-General KELLEY:

I cannot concentrate much; will have over 200 of the Sixth by morning. If the Seventeenth can be started to-night from Wheeling, it would be the best we could do. The militia are all disbanded. Am arming some of the citizens. No communication with Buckhannon.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CLARKSBURG, W. VA., September 26, 1864. (Received 8.30 p. m.)

Major-General KELLEY:

The telegraph line to Buckhannon ceased to work at 7.15 this evening.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.
