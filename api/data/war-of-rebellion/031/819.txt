WASHINGTON, December 3, 1862-1.40 p.m. (Received December 3.)

Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE:

The troops were all en route before your request about Liverpool Landing was received. The only way to divide them properly will be for you to send an officer to the point where the roads branch, so as to direct a part of the regiments to Liverpool Landing, and a part to Smith's.

I think of sending 10,000 or 15,000 more. Shall I send them by the same route?

General-in-Chief.
