The money to meet these drafts has not been furnished, and probably not more than one-sixth of this amount in available funds has been furnished. For example, of the $2,000,000 for Southwest Virginia there are drafts here for collection for considerably above half. In North Carolina most of the officers have funds to their credit which they could not obtain, and hence it was useless to add to an idle balance.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. STROTHER,

Captain and Assistant Commissary of Subsistence.

Major S. B. FRENCH,

Commissary of Subsistence, Richmond, Va.:

MAJOR: Herewith I hand semi-monthly statement* of subsistence stores on hand in the State on 31st ultimo. Pork and bacon commences to come in very freely in the eastern counties, but for the want of funds our officers and agents are greatly hindered in purchasing and collecting same. With money in hand to purchase they could secure large supplies.

I am, major, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
