CHARLESTON, W. VA., February 2, 1865.

Captain WHITLEY, Loup Creek, W. Va.:

Information just received form General Sheridan's headquarters partly confirms your intelligence. The number is not reported over 1,500. Be very vigilant and keep you scouts well out, but I do not think a move is contemplated at present.

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

LOUP CREEK, February 2, 1865.

Colonel J. H. OLEY, Commanding, &amp;c., Charleston:

My scouts from the Lewisburg road have returned. They reported that General Echols is at Lewisburg with his brigade of infantry, and the Fourteenth Virginia Cavalry is distributed in the neighborhood. Five other regiments of cavalry, under General McCausland, are in Greenbrier and Monroe. This report I think is correct. There is a rebel picket reported to be on the Flat Top. The rebel scouts were at Horse Shoe yesterday just after my scouts left that place.

J. WHITLEY, JR.,

Captain, Commanding Post.
