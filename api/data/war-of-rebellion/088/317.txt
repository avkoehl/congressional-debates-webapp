MOTT'S LEFT BRIGADE,

Chieves' House, August 19, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Colonel Pulford, commanding Mott's left brigade, reports that the break was made through General Warren's picket-line, three regiments to the left of our connection. The Colonel thinks that the enemy then turned to their right and were engaged by General Warren's troops. Colonel Pulford's men have 25 enlisted men and 2 officers prisoners, who state that they became detached from the command and lost. Some of them were stretcher-bearers, and say they belong to Hoke's brigade, Mahone's division. Colonel Pulford had strengthened his line, and preserves his connection with Warren's regiment on our left. Colonel Pulford has sent out to ascertain, if possible, from those regiments of the Fifth Corps if their connection with the main body is perfected. General Mott and I will remain here until we hear from this connection.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

General Warren reports that the enemy, after breaking through the picket-line on his right, compelled Crawford and Ayres to fall back. A heavy fight ensued, and the ground was regained and the line re-established. Many prisoner were taken from Heith's, Mahone's, and Hoke's divisions. General Warren is directed to establish his line to connect with yours to-night. The commanding general wishes you to aid in this with such available force as you have.
