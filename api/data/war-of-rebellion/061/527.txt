HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA,In the Field, April 8, 1864-6 p.m.

Brigadier General W. R. BOGGS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: We commenced skirmishing with the enemy about 2.30 p.m., which continued heavy for some time, the battle becoming general about 4 p.m. We have driven the enemy at this hour 3 miles with a loss to him of six guns, and, as far as ascertained, many hundred prisoners. We are still driving him. We have lost some very valuable officers, among others the gallant and chivalric General Mouton. The force of the enemy consists, as far as ascertained, of the Thirteenth Army Corps and troops from other corps, together with the enemy's cavalry force, which is large.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

Will report again at the close of the action. Churchill's troops were not up in time to take part in the action, and will be fresh in the morning. I shall push the enemy to the utmost.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA,Mansfield, April 8, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Brigadier General W. R. BOGGS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the fighting continued until night. The fight then for water was very severe, the enemy being at that time re-enforced by the Nineteenth Corps. We fought the Thirteenth Army Corps all day, and late in the evening met the Nineteenth Army Corps; repulsed and drove them back. We have captured about 2,000 prisoners, 20 pieces of artillery, 200 wagons, and thousands of small-arms. Our loss in officers has been severe, and we have many wounded. Send all the medical assistance and medical stores you can, and if you have any re-enforcements hurry them down. Churchill's and Parsons' divisions, which did not

take part in the fight to-day, have been ordered to the front before daylight to-morrow morning. I shall continue to push the enemy with the utmost vigor.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General, Commanding.
