lands," so as to make coffee free of duty imported
from- any part of the world.
The question being taken, the amendment of Mr.
Tibbatts was agreed to.
The question recurring on the "motion to strike
out, '
Mr. WINTHROP was understood-to say that
he cordially ap"proved_ of. the- amendment of the
gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Jones-,] yet he did
not feel it to be safe to act, upder present circum-
stances, in a matter which involved the faith of
the Qovernmfent as pledged in public treaties. He
believed there was nothing in the present law that
violated any subsisting treaties. But if, upon fur-
ther examination between this and the time when
they came to act on- the tariff bill, it should be
found that they^ could, consistently with the faith
of the nation, take any step of, this kind, to pro-
mote the navigating interests of the country, he
should cordially unite with the gentleman in efforts
to effect that object.
Mr. G. DA VIS (a member of the Committee
on Foreign Affairs) said he had not been present
at any meeting of the committee when this first
section had received their sanction, and he did not
believe it had undergone the full investigation of
the committee. He hoped that it would be strick-
en out.
Mr. S. .TONES, in reply to Mr. Winthrop,
said the section, as now amended, operated alone
on vessels of the United States, and certainly it
could not be affected by any treaty. But sup-
posing it was inconsistent with a treaty: the re-
sult would be, as the Secretary of the Treasury,
stated, that the treaty, being the paramount law
of the land, would override and render nugatory
the law. And it would take a long course of rea-
soning to convince him that the United States
would, by treaty with any nation, prevent herself
from removing restrictions on our own vessels.
This clause, as amended, took off the duty im-
posed by the tariff of 1842 upon coffee imported in
vessels of the United States, putting them on the
footing of Dutch vessels.
Mr. TIBBATTS said, as the section now stood,
coffee imported into the United States from any
part of the world would come in free of duty, and
of course Java coffee, from the Netherlands, would
come in free of duty. This section did not inter-
fere with the treaty at all; but its operation would
be, to make coffee introduced into the United States
free of duty, He was in favor of making it free,
and he hoped those in favor of it would keep this
provision m the bill. - .
Some conversation ensued between Mr. WIN-
THROP and Mr. BROCKENl! ROUGH.
Mr. B. said, if he understood the proposition oil
which they were called to vote, the effect of the
section, if'they retained it, would be to make the
importation of coffee free from whatever quarter it
comes, whether from the kingdom of the Nether-
lands or elsewhere. All those who were willing
that the importation of coffee should be free, and
who were willing to give greater encouragement
to American shipping, would vote to retain the
section.
The question was taken, tellers havina' been
ordered at the demand of Mr. C. J. INGER-
SOLLL, and it was decided in the negativeâ€”ayes
52, noes 59.
So the committee refused to strike out the section,

against the bill, and asked that its consideration be

the amendments should first lie printed, and then
brought before the Senate for action.
After some further conversation between Senators
JOHNSON, of Louisiana, HUNTINGTON, and
SPEIGHT, the consideration of the bill was post-
poned.
Mr. MANGUM said that he understood it to
be a general wish of the Senate to have a change
of carpeting, &c., made in tho Senate Chamber,

sentatives. As a preliminary step to the accom-
plishment of this end, he moved that when the
Senate adjourned, it should be to Monday next;
which motion was agreed to almost unanimously.
Mr. M. then moved that the necessary order be
o-iven for the accomplishment of the object above
alluded to, but, being informed that the motion was
unnecessary, it was withdrawn.

yesterday, to agree that if the vote was then taken
on ordering the bill to a third reading, he would
not press its final passage until the Senate was full.
After some conversation between Mr. ATHER-
TON and Mr. MOREHEAD, in which other

upon it, and who was now detained from his seat
by indisposition.
By consent of Mr. JOHNSON, of Louisiana,
