Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I relieved Colonel Devin's brigade yesterday morning at daylight, since which time all has been quiet on my lines, save a small demonstration yesterday at Aiken's, caused by my riding on the vedette line accompanied by two other officers and orderlies. Patrols to Lee's Mill and on old Norfolk road develop nothing new. At Lee's Mill the enemy have a picket-a post of observation, I presume.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. CHAPMAN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: In answer to your communication of this day concerning capture near Tatum's, I have the honor to state as follows: I am picketing the same line which was covered by the brigade I relieved. The left of my line of continuous or connecting vedettes rests near C. Brown's, on the road running from Temple's to the Prince George Court-House and Lee's Mill road; I also patrol to Lee's Mill and on the old Norfolk road, but these patrols are only sent out two or three times a day. I would suggest, respectfully, that I am covering as much ground as I can, and as much as any brigade of cavalry ought to cover. The enemy's line to my front is much heavier than mine; further, there is a scope of country from the Two Bridges near Zion Church to the road from Temple's to Lee's Mill road, above alluded to, which is not covered by any cavalry line. I have thus far seen no parties of the enemy prowling about my lines, and neither any parties of deserters nor stragglers from our army. I will forward, under guard, these deserters from the enemy (Fifth North Carolina Cavalry), who came into my lines on the Jerusalem plank road. I return communication from Fifth Corps.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. CHAPMAN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Colonel GEORGE H. CHAPMAN,

COLONEL: I am in receipt of your communication of to-day's date, in reply to mine of this morning, respecting guerrillas south of Prince George Court-House and between the Blackwater and the Norfolk road. The instructions to General Gregg for the picketing and patrolling by the brigade to be left near the plank road were as follows:

He will picket about the same line on the left that Colonel Bryan picketed, connecting with the infantry picket on his right, and extending around to the plank road near the church. He will patrol well down the plank road, well down the old
