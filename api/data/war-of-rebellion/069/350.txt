Brigadier-General GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division, Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the general to say that an entire brigade, under Colonel Hardin, is going out that direction, with orders to cross the road and advance in the direction of Machanicsville. He desires that you direct that the left of your skirmish line maintain the connection with the right of his as he advances.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have advanced a brigade under Hardin on my left, with instructions to drive the enemy's cavalry from the Machanicsville road. The connection with Griffin is complete. I hope to cover the Machanicsville road, and if I succeed, General Cutler must sustain my left. I have communicated with him, and asked him to send a brigade to support the picket-line on his flank and to connect closely with me. He seems to be indisposed to do this unless he receives orders from you. Hardin is advancing, but we are not yet on the road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 30, 1864 - 2.10 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

You had better support your brigade if necessary, yourself, and let General Cutler move up toward General Griffin. I think the cavalry will all run toward Machanicsville.
