HEADQUARTERS,Snyder's Mill, April 26, 1863-5. 30 p. m.

Major J. J. REEVE,

Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

MAJOR: At 5. 15 p. m. the chain which brought together the ends of the two wings of the raft (see diagram) at the point A, gave way, and the wings opened to the position C B and E D, leaving a space, E C, opened. No part of the raft is lost. The fastenings at band D hold well, and no part of the raft is in danger of being lost. Please telegraph to Mr. Weldon, at Yazoo City, to return forth with. The current above broke the chain. If the chain had not broken, I believe the raft itself would have parted along A D. I fear that it will be almost impossible to build a permanent raft as long as the current is so strong.

I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

LOUIS HEBERT.
