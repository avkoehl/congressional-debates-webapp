bridge with a small force and four guns, and more on the other side. General Gregg is going to make an attempt on it this morning. A brigade and battery has also gone down to try Germanna Ford. A surgeon captured this morning reports all Hill's (A. P.) corps on the Rapidan. Send me an engineer officer to help reconnoiter the crossings.

CULPEPER,

September 15, 1863-8.50 p.m.

Deserters and the current opinion of those I can get anything out of are positive that Longstreet's corps has gone to Richmond or farther south; that Ewell's and Hill's corps are about Orange Court-House, and General Lee is in command. Pleasonton reports Germanna Ford as the best place to cross. He says: "If you (I) were at the Rapidan Station now to occupy the attention of the enemy I believe I could effect a crossing below." I cannot move down there with safely, unless another corps moves out here.

From the best information I can get to-night, the enemy still hold this side of the Rapidan bridge, so I cannot have it reconstructed. The map indicates steeps banks on each side from that point down to Somerville Ford. The Clark's Mountain gives the enemy all the command, and I believe there is no command for our artillery till Germanna Ford is reached. There is a mill race on the other side, which gives the enemy's infantry shelter. It seems to me that the best way to turn the enemy is by a rapid move of troops toward Germanna or Ely's Fords.

General Pleasonton said he would report in full about the crossing to-night, but he has not yet done it. He says will you as General Meade to let me have the cavalry Kilpatrick and Gregg left behind on picket? We are very short-handed at this time. Lieutenant Gillespie has arrived. I will send both him and Lieutenant Roebling out to-morrow.

I have seen General Kilpatrick's dispatch. I do not much fear an advance of the enemy to-morrow. If I understand the object of our move the cavalry should dispute the advance of the enemy if attempted, and fall back upon me if necessary. We together will stop them, or fall back fighting if not strong enough. I do not feel authorized to advance, unless another corps moves out to take my place, in which case I think I could do it without risk.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General S. WILLIAMS.
