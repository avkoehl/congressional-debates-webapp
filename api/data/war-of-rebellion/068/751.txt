It has. it was relieved by Major Mitchell, from right to left. The enemy followed and wounded a few of the men. The colonel was here short time since. It was consolidated upon my right until all could [be] relieved, and I told Colonel Bates a short time since how to take them to your camp.

[Indorsement.]

General WARREN:

I do not know about the trains; I have had only a report from the medical director, Second Corps. I will know more soon, I suppose, as I sent a regiment of infantry there. The cavalry inquired the road to Fredericksburg.

W. S. H.

The medical director says that the ambulances and wagons took the road to Salem Church, and he supposes the enemy's cavalry wound strike them if they went that road.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The Fifth and Sixth Corps pickets have been withdrawn; are now concentrated on my right flank and will be sent to their corps at once. The enemy's pickets followed the line in and are now engaged with my skirmishers along the creek where my right rests, some distance above the Brown, house, where the road crosses the old line of rifle-pits . The enemy's cavalry was seen behind. Some of our pickets were wounded and a few captured.
