SECRETARY OF WAR:

Shall I write General Wood the answer I proposed in my letter to you of yesterday?

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, May 27, 1862.

Major General BENJAMIN HUGER, Drewry's Bluff:

I am only waiting for a list of the persons lately held as hostages to communicate with you by letter. I shall probably do so to-day. You are aware that there are no longer any hostages in our hands, the persons so treated having been considered as other prisoners of war since the privateersmen received the same consideration from the enemy. An equivalent for the privateersmen will be furnished from the persons who were hostages according to the cartel agreed on. Until you know the number and rank of the officers among the privateersmen I do not see how that equivalent can be determined.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
