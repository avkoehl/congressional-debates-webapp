ambulance and team be sent over, and Frank with my bay horse, and saddle, pistols, and belt. I shall probably go on a scouting expedition with Governor. Our Glasgow visit will be divided. Old folks now and the young ones by and by.

Colonel BLAIR,

Fort Scott:

Can you send the Fifteenth Kansas to Little Rock as ordered? Has the regiment of Wisconsin infantry arrived yet?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, April 18, 1865-8,20 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

Four companies of the Wisconsin infantry have arrived, but if the Fifteenth goes before the Wisconsin cavalry arrives it will leave the southwesters border unprotected. It takes all my other cavalry on the Missouri border to protect it from bush whackers. I have but about 300 of This Wisconsin Cavalry, and 100 of them are at Hickman Mills, near Kansas City, in Colonel Chester Harding's command. If they were ordered back I could send them west, and they might make the border safe until the rest of the companies of the regiment arrive, if they are on the way. I apprehend trouble out there this spring unless the country is well garrisoned. It is perhaps not improper for me to say that I have received no order as yet start the Fifteenth Kansas Cavalry to Little Rock.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel, &amp;c.
