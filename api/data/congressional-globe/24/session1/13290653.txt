APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
653
24th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Navy Appropriation Bill—Mr. Robertson.
Ho. of Reps.
Administration, $2,768,621 20; nearly one half
of the whole amount.
The inequality of the disbursement is equally
remai kab!e. Of the $4,372,345 46, first mentioned,
the Sutes of Kentucky and South Carolina, it
anneaied, had received no part, and the State of
Virginia the paltry sum of eighty dollars only;
ai>d to present the inequality in a still more strik-
ing in ", the six southtrn and southwestern
States, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia,Kentucky, and Tennessee, shared among
them $242,667 6"*, while New York alone re-
ceived $446,271 76, and Ohio $859,124 64. Upon
the new States, especially, hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and millions of acres of land have been
lavished for schools and colleges, and works of
internal improvement These donations and ex-
penditures not only directly added to their wealth,
but indirectly, also, by facilitating their commerce
and enhancing the value of their property, while
the old States—and among them those by whom
a vast domain was gratuitously surrendered—
derive no benefit from it, and little or no aid of
any kind from the General Government. Indeed,
  hile they bear their full proportion of the sums
thus expended, their capital and population are
constancy tempted nwny from them by the su-
penor ad vantages bestowed on the favored regions
of the West. We do not repine at the prosperity
of other States; we rejoice to behold it. But pos-
sessing, as many of them do, great commercial
advantages, and superior fertility of soil, there is
no reason why they should enjoy more than their
due proportion of the common property. It is
time that this injustice should be arrested; and
the most effectual means of doing this is to dis-
tribute the fund justly among all.
But the enormous increase of expenditures on
internal improvement,under the present dominant
party, is not the only instance in which it has de-
viated in practice from the principles it professed.
Those principles were proclaimed in the report,
to which I have already alluded, made in 1826 in
the Senate, (Mr. Benton's,) and in this House in
1828, (Mr Hamilton's.) The report of 1826 was
accompanied by six bills, cairying out the doc-
trines of retrenchment and reform. But no effect-
ive scheme, Mr. Hamilton told us, could be ex-
pected " without cordial aid of the Executive."
Well, sir, " the party" shortly after came into
power; they have now had a full sweep, with an
Executive of their own choosing, for seven years;
and what have they done > What retrenchment
have they effected > What abuses reformed > Is
it not admitted that our expenditures have vastly
increased, and abuses of every kind multiplied'
Look only to the expenses of Congress. In the
year 1834, the appropriations, including books,
and all contingencies, unless I have made an error
in computation, exceeded a million. It is true,
there have been some attempts, in a small way,
at retrenchment. In 1829 an effort was made to
effect a reduction of two dollars per day in the
pay of members of Congress after a certain pe-
riod of the session. But it failed by a majority
of two to one. The next session a further attempt
was made to retrench, by disallowing pay to ab-
sent members during their absence. A resolu-
tion to this effect actually passed the House, but
was lost in the Senate; and thus seems to have
ended the grand scheme of retrenchment and
reform.
So far from remedying abuses, every obstacle
seems thrown in the way of inquiry; and the
grossest negligence is evinced in regard to meas-
ures of great public interest. An inquiry was
instituted in the Senate as early as December,
1830, into the management of the Post Office
Department. It was moved again in the Senate
on the 25th June, 1834, and in the House on the
26th, a few days previous to adjournment. The
Senate committee reported on the 27th January,
1835. The House committee, having had leave
to sit during the recess, and subsequently during
the sitting of the House, made their report, or
rather two reports, on the 13th February, 1835,
three days after the Senate had sent down a bill
changing the organization of the Department.
That bill, passed by the Senate without a dis-
senting voice, was, on the 13th February, referred
to the Post Office Committee, who reported it on
the 21st, with an amendment. The amendment
was to strike out all after the enacting clause, and
insert a new bill. It was then committed to a
Committee of the Whole, and was never heard
of again.
A vast number of bills, some of them as im-
portant as any ever presented to Congress, shaied
a similar fate. I will mention the custom-house
bill, the patronage  bill, the Judiciary bill, the

Ohio and Michigan boundary bill, the deposits
bill, and the fortification bill. Most of these had
been matured in the Senate, and only awaited the
action of the House. Yet they were all swept
by the board.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in a report to
the Senate, suggested changes in respect to the
number and compensation of custom-house offi-
cers, whereby an annual saving might be made
of $177,150. This report was called for in June
and July, 1832, but, owing to the burning of the
Treasury building and other causes, was not
made till December, 1834. Such is the derange-
ment of our affairs, and the multiplicity of abuses,
as almost to defy scrutiny or reform. Why has
not this recommendation of the Secretary been
pursued' What excuse can be made for per-
mitting this immense annual loss ?
The condition of the public deposits, too, is
such as to demand some measures for their se-
curity. The necessity of regulations upon this
subject has been repeatedly urged upon Congress
by the President. I will do the then chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means [the pres-
ent Speaker] the justice to say, that during the
last session he frequently pressed it upon the at-
tention of the House. But nothing was done.
All these great interests were neglected; and there
is every probability that the present session will
also pass away without any effective legislation.
To whom is this neglect to be ascribed ' It must
be charged upon the Administration party. If
that party, having so large a majority cannot get
on with the public business, it is time that they
should surrender it to those who can.
Sir, everything is conducted upon party prin-
ciples ; the public service is lost sight of m looking
to the interests of party. The post office reports
developed the most flagrant abuses. Frauds were
detected in the mode of making contracts; large
sums of money were borrowed without lawful
authority; the Department converted into a party
machine; appointments and removals made, not
for the public good, but in subserviency to party
views. Yet no man has more strongly condemned
such conduct than the Chief Magistrate under
whose administration it is practiced. Mark, sir,
what he says in his letter to Colonel Monroe:
"Now is the time to exterminate the monster—party
spirit. By selecting characters for their probity, virtue,
capaeitv, and firmness, without respect to party, you will
go tarto eradicate those feelings which, on former occasions,
threw so many difficulties in the way of Government, and,
perhaps, have the pleasure and honor of uniting a people
heretofore politically divided. The Chief Magistrate of a
great and powerful nation should never indulge in party
feeling.   Consult no party m your choice."
In one sense, indeed, the President has con-
formed to the recommendation he gave, of paying
no respect to party. Since the commencement
of his Administration his Cabinet has displayed
all the colors of the rainbow. Federalists of the
deepest dye are selected for the highest offices.
It matters not what may be the political com-
plexion of the aspirant, provided only that he
shall subscribe to the infallibility of the political
pope.
In his letter to the Tennessee Legislature, the
President warns us against the danger of appoint-
ing members of Congress to office. He expresses
the opinion that, if a change should not be effected
in the Constitution, and important appointments
should still continue to devolve upon the Repre-
sentatives in Congress, that " corruption will be
come the order of the day." Yet what former
Administration has so frequently exercised this
corrupting power as himself' I will notenumer-
ate the instances; but there is one that ought not
to pass unnoticed. A former Speaker of this
House (Mr. Stevenson) was nominated, while
presiding over its deliberations, to a foreign em-
bassy. It appears, by a report laid before the
Senate, that, shortly after the close of a previous
session, in which also he had presided, he had
received a letter notifying him of the President's
intention to nominate him. The nomination was
rejected. We are bound to suppose it would not
have been made had not the public interests re-
quired it. The Senate had the same constitutional
right to reject as the President to nominate.  Both
I derive their power from the same clause in the
same instrument; yet the office was permitted,
I for nearly two y«ars, to remain yacant.   The
