Governor Shorter, of Alabama, telegraphs me that the enemy is ravaging the country on the railroad south of the Tennessee River, in Alabama, and calls on me to send troops to relief of country. He must mean country from Decatur west, in your jurisdiction. I have no force to send. Cannot you organize expedition by way of Russellville and co-operate with Roddey, understood to be about Moulton, and let your scouts on the right communicate with mine on my left?
