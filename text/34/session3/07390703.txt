1857.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
70S
hour has expired, and the resolution is not now
nending. *
Mr. LETCHER. I move that the rules be
suspended, and the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, for the purpose of considering the tariff
question.
MESSAGE PROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
Asbury Dickins, their Secretary, informing the
House that the Senate had passed a resolution and
bills of the following titles:
A resolution (S. No. 47) authorizing the pay-
ment of a certain expense incurred in the repairs
of the Congressional Library, under an act of
Congress approved March 19, 1852.
An act (S. No. 574) explanatory of an act enti-
tled " An act for the relief of Dempsey Pittman,"
approved August 1G, 1856.
An act (S. No. 576) making a grant of land to
the Territory of Minnesota, in alternate sections,
to aid in the construction of certain railroads in
said Territory;'and
An act (S. No. 592) for the relief of Jefferson
Wilson, administrator, with the will annexed, of
John F. Wray, deceased:
In which he was directed to ask the concurrence
of the House.
Also, that the Senate had passed an act (H. R..
No. 710) for the construction of a wagon road from
Fort Kearny, via the South Pass of the Rocky
Mountains and' Great Salt Lake Valley, to the
eastern portion of the State of California, and
for other purposes.
ENROLLED BILLS.
Mr. DAVIDSON, from the Committee on En-
rolled Bills, reported that the committee had
examined and found truly enrolled bills of the
following titles; when the Speaker signed the
same:
An act to incorporate an insurance company in
the city of Washington; and
An act making appropriations for the support
of the Military Acadcmy for the year ending the
30th of June, 1858.
Mr. WAKEMAN". This is private bill day,
and I move that the House resolve itself into a
Committee of the Whole House.
The SPEAKER. The motion of the gentle-
man from Virginia takes precedence, as it relates
to the special order.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine I hope the
House will vote down both motions, and dispose
of the resolution which was reported from the
Committee of Elections.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. That was in the
morning hour, which has expired.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. I think we had
better proceed first to the consideration of the
bills upon the Speaker's table, which were yes-
terday reported from tl\e Committee of the Whole
House. This the gentleman had better propose
if he is in favor of the disposition of the private
business. .;jg[
Mr. WAKEMAN. I desire to say to the
that the bills upon the Speaker's table are Senate
bills, and can be passed at anytime; but the bills
on the Calendar of the committee are mostly
House bills, and ought to be passed and sent to
. the Senate, in order to allow that body to take j
action upon them.
• Mr. WHEELER. I object to debate.
The SPEAKER. Further debate is in order
only by general consent. The question is upon
the motion that the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
Mr. LETCHER. I call for the yeas and nays.
Debate on the tariff will be closed on Monday,
and I desire to see who wants to confine the debate
to half a day.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
Mr. MILLSON. I call for tellers upon the
motion.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Craigf., and
Clark of Connecticut, were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
®yes 73, noes 68. *
So the motion was agreed to.
THE TARIFF.
The House accordingly resolved itself into
the Committee of tihe Whole on the state of the
Union, (Mr. H. Marshall in the chair,) and
resumed the consideration of the bill (H. R. No.
566) reducing the duty upon imports, and for
other purposes.
Messrs. SMITH andGARNETT, of Virginia,
severally addressed the committee on the special
order. Their speeches will be published in the
Appendix.
Mr. HORTON, of Ohio, obtained the floor; but
yielded to
Mr. BALL. Mr. Chairman, with the consent
of my colleague I move that the committee rise.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. Debate will be
closed on this bill on Monday next at four
o'clock. The probability is that there will be
no debate on this tariff question on that day. I
therefore suggest that my colleague proceed with
his remarks now, and then when he has finished
we take a recess, in order that oUier gentlemen,
who desire to speak on this que^fcn, may do so
this evening. Ifi*By §plleague prefers to speak
this evening, I wflrmove that the committee take
a recess now.
Mr. HORTON, of Ohio. I prefer to go on
now.
Mr. BALL. I withdraw my motion that the
CAWVTiittoo
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Will the
gentleman from Ohio yield to me for a moment ?
Mr. HORTON, of Ohio. Certainly, sir.
Mr. WASHBURNE. In the expectation that
in the proposed change of the tariff law of 1846 an
effort might be made to reduce the duty onpiglead,
I had intended to submit a few considerations on
that subject to the committee. The interests of
the manufacturers of lead have been represented
here, and I had designed to say a word m behalf
of a great interest of a portion of my constitu-
ents—of the mines in my own immediate section
—the men with picks and gads, who are devel-
oping the riches of that country. The subsequent
wise determination, however, of the Committee
of Ways and Means fo leave .that interest un-
touched, relieves me from the necessity of making
any extended remarks on the subject. I will,
however, allude to some matters connected with
the lead interest, in order to correct erroneous
impressions in regard to the subject. _ .
The lessened amount of the production of the
Galena mines for the last few years is not owing
to the reason, which is alleged by some, that those
mines are exhausted, but it arises from causes
well understood by all who have any knowledge
of the lead-bearing region of the upper Missis-
sippi. Those mines are utterly inexhaustible;
they can produce lead ore in sufficient quantities
not only to supply this country, but the world;
and the quality of the ore is superior to the ore
of any mines that have ever been worked in any
country. The ore is found everywhere ill the
mining region—in the hills and in the valleys and
in the prairies. Our mining country differs from
most miningcountriesinthis: that its exhaustless
mineral wealth is united to great agricultural
resources, and the consequence is, that miners
can turn their attention to agricultural pursuits
when those pursuits are more prosperous than
mining.
The following statement, taken from authentic
sources, shows the extent and importance of the
lead trade of Galena for a series of years:

I have no retui-ns as to the product of 1856,
but, front my observation, I think it will fully
equal the product of 1855. The above table
shows the product of pig lead, and the average
yearly prices at Galena. The value of the lead
shipped from Galena for 1855, as will be seen
from the above table, was nearly eighteen hundred
thousand dollars.
It will be seen by this statement that the largest
product of the Galena mines was in 1845. That
year it reached 778,498 pigs, or a little over fifty-
four millions of pounds. The productof thetwo
following years was but slightly diminished; but
from 1847 down to 1852 there was a gradual de-
crease. From 1852 to the present time there has
been a small, but gradual inereasenn the product.
The cause of the decrease is not, as I have said,
from the mines giving out; but it is to be attrib-
uted, in the first place, to the breaking out of the
Mexican war, which took off very large numbers
of our miners. On the conclusion of the war,
the discovery of the gold mines in California was
the cause of another large draft of our mining
population, who were anxious to try gold mining
• in the place of lead mining. These two causes
deprived our mining country of quite half of its
best miners; but those who remained have pro-
duced more ore to the man employed than was
produced prior to 1847. The drain to California
has now stopped, and many miners who went
thither have returned to the lead mines. Added
to these causes, {jy! flourishing condition of agri-
cultural pursuits ror the last few years has taken
many miners from their old avocations. But
when public attention shall be again directed to
operations in lead mining, it will be found that
the Galena mines alone will produce sufficient
lead to supply all the demands of our own coun-
try. A temporary depression of any particular
interest should not be made a reason for chang-
ing a law that should be permanent. In loolung
into the history of this subject for a series of
years, we find that we have, in our own country,
not only produced all the lead consumed, but
have imported quite largely. Prior to the adop-
tion of the tariff of 1846, and when there was a
specific duty of three cents per pound on pig lead,
results were had such as are shown in the fol-
lowing table, which I find in the lata report on
the finances:
lead, and the manufactures thereof.

* The year 1843 is given for nine months only, in conse-
quence of a change in the fiscal year.
Thus it will be seen that in 1846 we not only
produced all the lead that was wanted for our
home consumption that year, but we exported
§624,796 worth, and did not import a single pig.
With the increased demand and- the enhanced
price of this product, aflji with adequate protec-
tion, what has been doapheretofore will be done
again. And when we take into consideration the
vast importance of this interest, it would be
unwise legislation that would in anywise interfere
with it. It is an interest that has built up a por-
tion of the district I have the honor to represent
on this floor, and made it one of the most wealthy
and important parts of the country: it is an
interest destined to flourish and become more
important as the wealth of the mines shall be
further developed by the investment of capital
and the application of machinery. It is an interest
I shall always defend and uphold, so long as I
hold a scat in Congress. As yet, it can hardly
be said that our upper Mississippi lead mines
have been developed at all. The mining here-
tofore done has been what is called "surface
mining," while the large bodies of mineral below
have not been touched. The time must soon
come when the attention of those engaged in the
manufactures of lead must be turned to tnese vast
deposits of lead ore in our own lead mines as a
source from which they can derive their supplies,
instead of depending upon a foreign market. I
might submit other and further considerations
in this connection, but as the "Ways and Means
Committee propose no change, I will not proceed
further.
