eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry took in the late campaign, which commenced at Savannah, Ga., January 20, 1865, and terminated so successfully at this March 24, 1865.

On the 20th of January we marched from Savannah to Cherokee Hill, a distance of nine miles. Owing to bad weather we remained here until the morning of January 24, when we again resumed our march toward Sister's Ferry, Ga., arriving there on the 28th of January. Thus far nothing of interest occurred. I would here state that the health of the regiment was much improved, not more than five reported sick each day. While at Savannah we have had as many as fifteen excused from duty.

We remained in camp at Sister's Ferry, Ga., until the evening of February 5, when the regiment, with the remainder of the brigade, crossed the Savannah River into South Carolina and encamped near the ferry. From the 28th of January to February 5 we furnished our proportion of men for fatigue and picket duty. While encamped at the ferry the regiment procured some forage, such as beans, fresh meat, small quantities of flour and corn meal. The regiment procured sufficient forage in the country for all the animals in the regiment. From February 5 to the morning of February 8 the regiment remained in the same camp as first occupied on the might of 5th. while here the regiment was partially supplied with clothing, although the requisition that had previously been made [was] not more than two-thirds filled, consequently the men are in poor plight at present for duty or military appearance. Some of them are suffering for shoes, socks, and pants. On the morning of February 8 Lieutenant-Colonel Pearce assumed command of the regiment, having from the command of the brigade by the return of General John G. Mitchell. From February 8 until the present time the regiment has done its proportion of duty with the remainder of the brigade. During the campaign we generally had sufficient [sic*] delayed at Catawba River in consequence of bad weather and heavy roads. While there we did not suffer much. Although the regiment was entirely our of rations for twenty-four hours, yet I heard not a murmur or complaint from a single man; every man seemed willing to endure any hardship that the campaign might be a great success and not a miserable failure.

From March 7 to the termination of the campaign our foraging party has been quite successful, having at all times furnished an abundance of meat and tolerable good quantities of meal by taking possession of mills and procuring corn along the route, which was ground and issued to the men. The foraging party at first consisted of one-fifth of the command, but after crossing Broad River the greater portion of the detail returned to the command. From this time there were but twenty forages (these were mounted), two of which were captured. Two men are missing; they left camp on the 7th instant without authority. I have not the least doubt that they straggled from the command and were picked up by the enemy's cavalry. None were killed or wounded until the 19th instant.

The part taken by the regiment on that memorable Sabbath is known to the general commanding, he being an eye witness of the entire engagement. It is my opinion that had the Thirty-fourth Illinois Veteran Volunteer Infantry and the Ninety-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry become panic-stricken or been compelled to leave their works the
