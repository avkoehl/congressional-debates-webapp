HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-9.20 a. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

Have you determined who attacked you this morning? Did the enemy mass for the purpose? Is your decision definitive that you cannot attack? Troops are halted, moving to support you. The two divisions of Fifth Corps will be ordered to move on until halted by your orders.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

Crawford's division at the Gurley house; Ayres' just behind; Grifin's at Waytt's; Wheaton's division between trestle-work and Jones' house. All is still at present. Colonel of the Seventeenth South Carolina, Johnson's division, is a prisoner.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-9.30 a .m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Gordon's command was, I think, re-enforced by Johnson's division. I think it too late to attack now. The enemy's lines are unchanged. They made an attack with the determination of carrying our line, but failed. Have since made a slight demonstration, but without result. Their lines are evidently now fully manned and prepared for us.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-9.30 a. m.

Major-General PARKE:

Since two divisions of the Fifth Crops are still moving toward our right give your order to them to stop as soon as you shall have determined not attack.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MARCH 25, 1865-9.40 a. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

In obedience to instructions from Major-General Meade, I have directed Crawford's and Ayres' divisions to move on till halted by you.
