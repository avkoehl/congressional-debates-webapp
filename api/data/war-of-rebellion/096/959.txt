HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 13, 1865.

Brevet Major-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Davis, at Summit Point, reports that he has reliable information that Mosby has crossed the river with a view to a raid, as mentioned in my note a few minutes ago. The general wishes you to send a force of, say, 500 men to Berryville to-night, with orders to the commanding officer to collect all the information he can concerning Mosby's movements, and, if possible, to attack him. After arriving at Berryville the officer in command must be governed by circumstances. If he hears firing in the direction of Summit Point he should proceed in that direction. Mosby is said to have crossed near Kabletown, and may attempt to make his way back by Snicker's Ferry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Major-General Emory.)
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 13, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

It is reported that the enemy contemplate a raid on Summit Point Station. Probably they may attempt to pass through your lines toward the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad instead. Time not given by informant. There are but seventeen officers reported for duty. Where are the officers?

C. H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff.
