APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[June 12,
35th Cong....1st Sess.
P.ublic Expenditures—Mr. Letcher.
Ho. of Reps.
other error of the neat little sum of $284,000—
no great amount, to be sure, yet still worthy of a
passing notice. Then we have an item, styled
miscellaneous, of $373,318, which is intended to
pay off obligations imposed upon us by the legis-
lation of the last Congress. It is under this head
that we find the appropriations for custom-houses,
marine hospitals, and other public buildings,
which cover the "jobs and contracts" to which he
refers. I cannot suppose that the gentleman de-
signs to impute dishonesty to the officers of the
Government in connection with the contracts for
these buildings ordered by Congress. The con-
tracts which have been made, were made by the
Fillmore and Pierce administrations, and not by
the present Administration. But for the Opposition
these buildings would not have been ordered by
Congress, and I would really like to know what
the gentleman from Galena [Mr. Washburne]
and from Detroit [Mr. Howard] and from Louis-
ville [Mr. Marshall] and from Cleveland [Mr.
Wade] think of this assault, coming from so dis-
tinguished an Opposition leader. Let the gentle-
man and his friends shoulder the responsibility
which legitimately attaches to them for the neces-
sity which demanded this appropriation. The
Administration is in nojust sense chargeable with
it, and the country will so decide. Then we have
the Army deficiency of $7,995,000, paraded as
another evidence of extravagance and profligacy.
Was this expenditure necessary ? I maintain that
it was; that the public sentiment of the people,
without distinction of party, demanded that the
laws should be enforced in Utah. The President
has executed this order of the people, and has
brought the Mormons into subjection to the law-
ful authority of the Government. A prudent fore-
cast, a wise statesmanship, have controlled and
directed the entire policy of the President towards
these misguided people; and peace, quiet, order,
and obedience to the laws have been secured with-
out firing a gun or shedding a drop of human
blood. Everywhere this result is hailed with sat-
isfaction, and the sound, conservative men of the
nation applauded the prudence, wisdom, firmness,
and practical judgment which have been exhib-
ited by the Administration in the happy adjust-
ment of this difficult and dangerous question.
Let the gentleman from Ohio and his party friends
make the issue that the President has done wrong;
that the measures which he has adopted have
been unwise and injudicious; let them, if they see
fit, charge that he has wasted the public money,
and they will find us ready to meet them and try
the issue before the people. The respect and af-
fection of the people for law and order, their set-
tled and determined hostility to everything that
wears the appearance of open resistance to the
authority of a Government to which we owe obe-
dience, leaves no room for doubt as to their verdict
whenever such issues shall be presented to them
for their decision. We challenge the Opposition
to these issues. Will they, dare they, meet us upon
them > If they think we have spent more money
than is necessary, we call upon them to specify
the items of expenditure that are, in their judg-
ment, extravagant. Withhold in future your
wholesale charges, and give us the details. In
the name of the tax-paying millions, I demand
this of you. This sum, however, has been ap-
propriated to support the army in Utah, for the
next year, and is therefore an advance—not a
deficiency. The last item enumerated is, the defi-
ciency for the Post Office Department, amounting
to #1,469,173. Was not this expenditure required
to carry out the legislation of the last Congress ?
New post routes were established, and mails could
not be placed upon them withoutentailing expense
upon the Treasury. To meet this expense we
were compelled to provide the means in the defi-
ciency bill, passed at the opening of the session.
] inu'gine the gentleman, and nine tenths of his
friends in both Houses, voted for the post-route
bill; the execution of which made this expendi-
ture unavoidable.
On this branch of the subject I prove that the
gentleman from Ohio has committed several very
extraordinary errors—unintentional I doubt not,
but yet such errors as clearly demonstrate that
implicit reliance should not be placed upon his
calculations. The first error consists m charging
the Administration with the surplus in the Treas-
ury on the 1st of July last, and withholding from
it credit for the amount of the public debt, which
it has paid out of it since that date. The second
error consists in fixing the Sound dues, by treaty
with Denmark, at $333,011, when the true sum is
$408,731 44. The third error consists in estimat-
ing the balance of the printing deficiency for the
year ending the 30th of this month at $600,000,
while the civil appropriation bill shows that it
is only $316,000. The fourth error consists in
fixing the amount of the deficiency bills passed
at this session at $11,041,690, when it should have
been $9,704,209 89 for the first, and $341,189 58
for the printing bill, and $408,731 44 forthe trea-
ty with Denmark, making, in the aggregate,
$10,454,130 91. Rather serious errors in a speech
which was designed to be used as a text-book by
the Opposition in their war upon the Administra-
tion !
I now come to his estimate of the expenditures
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859. He
makes a most startling exhibit, and works out
an aggregate of expenditures for the next year of
$92,143,202. And how is this monstrous result
ascertained ? In the first place, he informs us that
the Secretary of the Treasury estimates the ex-
penditures for the year named at $74,064,755,
and then he adds the following items, amounting
to $18,089,547:
Three new regiments $4,289,547
Probable Post Office deficiencies over amount
appropriated    2,500,000
Public buildings  1,700.000
Private bills, (estimated)  1,000,000
Printing deficiency  600,000
Army deficiency, (estimated to be tlie same as
last year)    B,000,000
Not one cent has been appropriated for the
three new regiments—the President having ascer-
tained that they would not be needed for the ser-
vice in Utah, in the regular Post Office appro-
priation bill we have appropriated for the Post
Office Department, for the year 1859, the sum of
$3,500,000, which exceeds the regular appropria-
tion forthe present year, by the sum of $1,000,000.
The Post Oifice Departmentdrewfiom the Treas-
ury, forthe year ending June 30,1858, $3,969,173.
Suppose the Department should require the same
amount for the year 1859, as we have provided
in the regular appropriation bill for $3,500,000,
wc would only be called upon for the additional
sum of $469,173. This, then, is an error of up-
wards ot' #2,000,000 in his estimate in regard to
this single item. The regular appropriation bill
contains all the sums necessary for public build-
ings, amounting to $3,104,600; and this, therefore,
is likewise an erroneous estimate. We have been
charged once by the gentleman with the printing
deficiency of $600,000 in the expenditures of 1858;
but, for some reason that he has not chosen to
assign, he again charges us with it in the expend-
itures of the year 1859. And, finally, he esti-
mates that the Army deficiency for tho year 1859
will amount to the round sum of $8,000,000. All
these are conjectures, and, so far as their accura-
cy can be tested by existing facts, they are shown
to be of the most unreliable character. That the
gentleman himself is not satisfied with them
is clearly manifest from his declaration that they
"may be over-estimatedI submit it to him to
say, whether, from the facts now before him, he
is not entirely satisfied that they are greatly
" over-estimated."
The gentleman then proceeds thus:
" Now, this sum of $92,000 000 does not include any of
the following items of expcnriituie, and I wish gentlemen
to add those, upon their own estimate, to this aggtegate:
For protecting works commenced on our nuineiout- rivers
and harbors, the lowest estimate of winch is $1,500,000;
and then there is your Calendar of one thousand private
bills demanding your attention. There is the pension bill
for tho old soldiers of the war of 3 SI -2, proposed by the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, [Mr. Savage,] requiring$8,000,000
per annum. There are the ten new war st^amcin, piopoyed
by mv fiiend ftom Vnajtma, [Mr. Bocock.] 500,000. The
French spoliation bill, urged so forcibly by the gentleman
! from Massachusetts, [Mr. Davis,] which, if p.issed, will
require §.1,000,000. The duties to be refunded on goods
de&troyed by fire—I do not know how much Commutation
to the heirs of revolutionary soldiers—I do not know how
much. Claims growing out of Indian wars in Oregon and
Washington, uiged by the J)elegate from Oregon, and certi-
• fied by an executive officer, $5,000,000. Then we have the
! Pacific railroad, a foretaste of the cost of winch we have
| had m §*1.000,000 expended already in the publication of the
i report of the surveys."
i But two of the measures enumerated in this
formidable list by the gentleman from Ohio have
received the sanction of Congress—the addition of
seven steamers forthe Navy,and for that purpose
an appropriation of $1,200,000 has been embraced
in the regular naval bill; and the amount neces-
sary to pay the private claims allowed by Con-
gress. What sum will be required for this latter
purpose cannot now be determined, but I imagine
it will exceed his estimate of $1,000,000. The
bill to refund duties on goods destroyed by fire
was defeated in the House before the gentleman's
speech was delivered. Bear in mind the fact, that
none of these measures have been recommended
by the Departments or the President.
Having thus noticed the gentleman's estimate,
I now desire to inquire whether he is not in favor
of all the measures he has referred to, and wheth-
er he is not ready to give each and all his cordial
and hearty approval ? Are not his political asso-
ciates, or, at any rate, an overwhelming majority
of them, in favor of all these measures, and are
they not ready to cast their votes in aid of their
passage ? Whatever may be the gentleman's in-
dividual position, I apprehend there can be little,
if any, doubt as to the position of the larger por-
tion of his political friends.
I now come to the estimates of the Secretary of
the Treasury, and to the recommendations of the
Committee of Ways and Means, made to Con-
gress at the present session:
The Secretaiy estimates that of the appropriations for 1858,
there will be expended during 1859 $16,586,588 35
Permanent and indefinite ap-
propriations $7,165,224 49
Add for collection of revenue
from customs  1,150,000 00
 8,315,224 49
Recommendations for the year
1859, as reported by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means.,52,295,048 22
All other appropriations (esti-
mated) at the present ses-
sion  3,000,000 00
55,295,048 22
Of this sum there will be ex-
pended during the vear 1860.15.000,000 00
  40,295,048 22
$65,196,861 06
When the gentleman from Ohio made his esti-
mate of $92,000,000 as the expenditures for the
year 1859, he was sadly mistaken in his calcula-
tions. Against his conjectural estimates I now
oppose conjectural estimates of the Secretary of
tho Treasury; and it is palpable that the gentle-
man has been mistaken to the extent of only about
$27,000,000. Is it to be wondered at that, with
such errors as I have pointed out, the shrewd ed-
itor of the New York Tribune, in his issue of
the 3d of this month, in noticing the gentle-
man's speech, should have said: "We should
have liked it much better if it had worn noyarty
aspect, and had been undeniably nun-partisan in its
scope and bearings?"
1 propose to examine into the estimates of the
Secretary of the Treasury a little further, to show
that he has exhibited sound judgment and practi-
cal knowledge of the duties of his office:
The annual estimates of appropriations sub-
mitted are $50,312,943 13
Other estimates referred to the Committee
of Ways and Means at various tunes
during the session  3,909.917 91
$54,22-2,861 04
So much for the estimates, of the Secretary.
Now, I present the regular appropriations for
the service of the year 1859, amounting to the sum
of $53,458,233 22:
Pension  $769,500 00
Indian, regular  1,338,104 49
" supplemental  959,957 86
" deficiency  339,595 00
