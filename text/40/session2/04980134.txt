THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 11,
mer of 1862, and he was summarily dismissed
by order of the Secretary of War on the 3d
day of July. He was never tried by court-
martial, and I believe there is no record on
file which had the approval of the President.
I wish to know if this bill would stop an appli-
cation now pending to remove that stigma and
permit him to have an honorable discharge.
Mr. GARFIELD. My colleague will see
that this bill does not touch such a case at all.
It is confined exclusively to cases where the
officer was tried by general court-martial and
the finding regularly and formally approved
dismissing him or cashiering him. It would
not touch the case of an officer who was dis-
missed by summary,process, and therefore the
case to which the gentleman refers would not
be in the slightest degree affected by it.
Mr. MUNGEN. The point is whether an
order of the Secretary of War is not of as high
authority as the decision of a court-martial.
Mr. GARFIELD. No, sir; that case does
not He within the range of this bill at all. At
the suggestion of the gentleman from Illinois
[Mr.AiOÂ«AN] I am now willing that the bill
shalfbe recommitted.
Mr. PAINE. I move to amend the instruc-
tions to be given to the committee on the re-
commitment so as to require them to insert in
the bill a proviso that it shall not be so con-
strued as to prevent the President from remov-
ing the stigma from the name of an officer.
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not under-
stand the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Logan]
as moving instructions to the committee. .
Mr. LOGAN. No, sir; I only move to
recommit the bill.
Mr. PAINE. Then I withdraw the amend-
ment.
The bill was then recommitted to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs.
tub fenian trials.
Mr. BANKS. I ask leave to present a letter
from the Secretary of State in answer to a
resolution of the House, and ask that it be
read.
The Clerk read the letter, as follows;
Department or Stati, December 10,1867.
Hon. N. P. Bakes, Chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, Howe of Jlepresentativei:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter of the 9th instant, accompanied by a copy
of a resolution passed by the House of Represeuta-
tiYes November 25, 1867, calling for information in
relation to the trial and conviction of American citi-
zens in Great Britain.
In reply I have the honor to inform you that as it
is not usual or in conformity with law to remove such
papers from the archives of the Department, it will
bo necessary to have them copied. This, with all the
diligence which may be used by the extra force which
will bo required for the purpose, will consume much
time, as tho documents are very voluminous.
I hare the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
W. H. SEWABD.
Mr. BANKS. I move the reference of the
letter to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I
may say in aflditioa to what is said in tie

House the aggregate amountof the twenty per cent,
allowance to theclerks and employes of their respect-
ive Departments for the year ending June 30, 1867,
under tho act of Congress authorizing the payment
thereof.
Mr. ROBINSON. Does that refer to the
Treasury Department?
The SPEAKER. It is a report from the
joint Committee on Retrenchment.
Mr. ROBINSON. Ought not these matters
to go to the different committees on the ex-
penditures of the Departments ? Is this a gen-
eral committee?
The SPEAKER. The Committee on Re-
trenchment has general jurisdiction of this
subject, while the several Committees on the
expenditures of the different Departments have
specific jurisdiction.
Mr. ROBINSON. Iintendedatsometimeto
bring up this subject. Either these committees ;
should be abolished or this general committee
should not take the whole of these matters
into consideration.
The SPEAKER. These committees on the
expenditures of the various Departments have
had referred to them such portions of the Pres-
ident's message and accompanying documents
as relate to their duties.
Mr. WELKER. I do not see any difficulty
growing out of this resolution. It simply asks
for information. I was directed by the com-
mittee to report this resolution and ask for its
adoption. The information when received will
go to all these other committees as well as to
ours. Of course we do not propose to assume
exclusive jurisdiction of this question, or at all
to interfere with these other committees. i
Mr. ROBINSON. When this subject comes ,
up on the reply to this resolution I will have 1
something to say. i
The resolution was then adopted. {
