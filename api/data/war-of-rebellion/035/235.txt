HEADQUARTERS, Cincinnati, Ohio, April 12, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch in reference to the fortifications at Louisville is received. There are no soldiers at Louisville available for labor, and but a limited number of contrabands, and as there will be a difficulty in furnishing the armament, I shall not commence the work without further instructions from you.

There is nothing new from the front, save vague reports of a large concentration of troops on the river, said to be for the purpose of invasion, but there is nothing reliable as yet.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, April 12, 1863.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department:

The four regiments you ask for will be sent to you as soon as possible Ducat will leave early to-morrow.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., April 13, 1863-1 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Dodge says his scouts along the Tennessee report great activity along the river in building flat-boats and collecting forage between Florence and Decatur.

It may mean preparations for temporary ferriage, but it may mean crossing of troops. Whether Vicksburgs this way or Bragg's forces the other, remains to be seen. You may know things to help solve the question.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

CORINTH, April 13, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

My assistant adjutant-general has just returned from Tuscumbia. Two brigades and one battery have been added to their command since last Sunday a week ago. Under general reconnaissance it appears that they expected a move by way of the Tennessee River by Major-General Rosecrans. They have now there 6,000 men and eleven pieces of artillery. This is certain. I sent full report to General Oglesby, with request for him to send to you. At Tuscumbia they had a telegram of the 11th from Charleston, saying our forces were advancing upon them by land.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
