Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Forrest has attacked and probably occupies Union City. He has cut the road and wire this side. I go out with 2,000 men. Some of these men belong to General Veatch. I will return to Cairo and send them up Tennessee as soon as their boats arrive from Saint Louis. I will not detain them.
