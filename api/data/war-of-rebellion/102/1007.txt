HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, June 27, 1865.

Brigadier General R. A. CAMERON,

Commanding District of La Fourche:

GENERAL: I am directed by the commanding general to inform You that it is not intended to concentrate the whole of the Seventy-fifth at Terre Bonne at present unless their services can be entirely dispensed with at and beyond Brashear. The order on the subject of the concentration of this regiment from these headquarters required all troops of this regiment then stationed this side of Brashear to concentrate at Terre Bonne. The object of this was to collect the scattered companies on the railroad, where their service can now be dispensed with. It was not supposed that this order would collect over three companies. As to the Rhode Island cavalry, as well as all other regiments within Your limits, they are already at Your disposal on any emergency. The idea is to keep the troops as much concentrated as possible, ready for any orders, and when any emergency calling for troops occurs they are in readiness to meet any orders given them.

I am, sir, respectfully, Your obedient servant,

WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
