HARRISBURG, August 20, 1861.

Honorable T. A. SCOTT:

Have two more regiments added to the requisition on Pennsylvania. It answers all our arrangements, and I believe we can raise them. Answer immediately, as very little is to be expected from independent regiments. You notice how it this in Philadelphia from my dispatch to the Secretary.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania:

You may consider the Governor of Pennsylvania authorized to add two more regiments of infantry for three years or during the war to requisitions already made. Organize them speedily.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, August 20, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The independent regiments, I am informed by their colonels, are in many cases unarmed. It seems to me very important that in each such case they should be escorted through Baltimore by a sufficient armed guard detailed from the force stationed there.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

Governor PEIRPOINT,

Wheeling, Va.:

We may avoid all necessity for using militia. Urge the speedy organization of volunteers. Do nothing in regard to temporary forces, unless a formal requisition is made by the President.

Governor RANDALL,

Madison, Wis.:

Mustering officers will be furnished. New order provides that first lieutenant can be mustered when one-half of a company is enrolled, and all officers mustered in have power to muster men. This will obviate trouble about mustering. Copies of orders will be sent.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
