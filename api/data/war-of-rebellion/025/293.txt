HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Jackson, Tenn., October 25, 1862.

General C. S. HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

Price is moving with considerable force toward Bolivar. He is now about 4 miles south of Grand Junction. Hold your troops in readiness for defense where they are or to move with three days' rations in haversacks as may be required. All other moves will be suspended until this blows over.

It may be possible that this is to cover a move on Corinth. Be prepared. I can re-enforce you with ten regiments from here if it becomes necessary.

U. S. GRANT.

CORINTH, October 25, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Dispatch received. Will bee ready. A Catholic priest just arrived from Huntsville says the rebels there had new that Mobile was attacked. Price may be causing a movement in that direction.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

Major General STEPHEN A. HURLBUT,

Commanding District of Jackson:

You will have two brigades of the troops at this place in readiness to move at a moment's notice with three days' rations in haversacks and 100 rounds of ammunition to each man.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

JACKSON, October 25, 1862.

COMMANDING OFFICERS HUMBOLDT, TRENTON, AND COLUMBUS:

Hold one regiment at Columbus, and the regiments not detached on railroad guard from Trenton and Humboldt, with three days' rations in haversacks, ready to move if ordered.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

BOLIVAR, October 25, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Major Hayes has just returned from a scout to Middleburg and reports the cavalry in that vicinity were a couple of companies of cottonburners.

He also reports the significant fact that the railroad bridge at Davis' Mill has been repaired, and that a very large force of Price's army was 4 miles below Grand Junction last night. No further news could be obtained of them to-day. It looks very much as though Price was making a movement this way. All the appearances and information I can get here indicate it.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
