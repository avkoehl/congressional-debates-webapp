Major-General SLOCUM:

DEAR GENERAL: I will move this p. m. with Davis to the forks of the road, and, it maybe, accompany him and join Mower at the point where he crosses Davis' road. I would like to see the country about Spotsylvania Court-House, and thence by Warrenton and Manassas to Alexandria. I will hardly reach Chilesburg to-night. Be careful to give Davis and Mower the best information you have of the road.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
