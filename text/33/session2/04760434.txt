MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE.
A message was received from the House of
Representatives, by Mr. Fornev, their Clerk, an-
nouncing that they had passed a bill to provide
for the ascertainment and satisfaction of claims of
American citizens for spoliations committed by
the French prior to the 31st day of July, 1801.
Also, that they had paseed the following resolu-
tions of the Senate:
Resolution respecting the Arctic expedition
commanded by Passed Assistant Surgeon E. K.
Kane.
Resolution relative to the construction of the
laws for the allowance of additional compensation
to the clerks in the Census Bureau.
FEES OF TERRITORIAL OFFICERS.
Mr. DOUGLAS, from the Committee on Ter-
ritories, reported a " bill to extend to the Terri-
tories generally, the laws regulating the fees and
compensation of officers, and the suitors of the
United States courts in Oregon;1' which was read
and ordered to a second reading.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I ask for the present consid-
eration of the bill, and I will explain its purpose.
About two years ago, we passed a fee bill for the
United States courts, which, as I supposed, ap-
plied to all the States and Territories; but it has
been construed, at the Treasury Department, to
apply only to the States and to the Territory of
Oregon. This bill is to declare that it shall have
the same effect in the other Territories as in the
Territory of Oregon. Under the law, the clerk ia
entitled to $500, unless his fees amount to that
sum. If they amount to that, hegets no payfrom
the United Statps. This is simply to extend the
provision to the new Territories, so that, if the
fees of the clerks do not amount to $500, they
shall be made up to it, the same as in the States.
It is now construed to apply to the States and the
Territory of Oregon. I presume theie can be
no objection to it. The reason why 1 ask for ita
consideration now, is, that to-da,/, to-morrow,
and the next day, are territorial days in the other
House, and unless it be considered now it cannot
be acted on there this year.
The bill was read a second time and considered
as in Committee of the Whole. It proposes to
extend the provisions and principles of the act of
February 26, 1853, entitled, "an act to regulate
the fees and costs to be allowed clerks, marshals,
and attorneys of the circuit and district courts of
the United States, and for other purposes," to all
similar officers in all the Territoiies of the United
States, and that the same fees and compensation
authorized by the act in the Territory of Oregon
be allowed in each of the other Territories to
similar officers. The act is to have effect from
and after the date of the approval of the act of
Febiuary 2G, 1853.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read a third time, and passed.
SECRETARY OF MINNESOTA.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I am also directed by the Com-
mittee on Territories to report a joint resolution
for the relief of the Secretary of the Territory of
Minnesota, and I ask that it may be considered
now, for the same reason, viz. that to-day and the
two following days have been set apart m the
House for territorial business.
The joint resolution was read twice by unani-
imous consent, and considered as in Committee of
the Whole. Its object is to require the account-
ing officers of the United States Treasury to allow
to the Secretary of the Territory a credit for $K85,
in the settlement of his account, that being the
amount of an account paid by him for collating,
noting, indexing, and superintending the publica-
tion of the laws of the Territory, for the years
1849, 1851, 1852, and 1853; and for indexing, and,
in part, reporting the decisions of the supreme
court of the Territory for 1850 and 1851, agreeably
to the provision of a joint resolution of the Legis-
lature, passed in March, 1853.
Mr. DOUGLAS. The Secretary was directed
by the Territorial Legislature to have that work
done, and it was done accordingly. Doubts, were,
however, entertained at the Treasury Department
as to whether that was in strict conformity with
the organic law of the Territory. That it is a
case of merit there is no doubt, I believe. I hope
it may be passed now.
The joint resolution was reported to the Senate
without amendment, ordered to be engrossed for
a third reading, read the third time, and passed.
EFFICIENCY OF THE NAVY.
Mr. MALLORY. By direction of the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs, 1 report a bill to promote
the efficiency of the Navy. In doing so, Mr.
President, I desire to say to the Senate that the
Committees on Naval Affairs of the two Houses
have despaired of obtaining congressional action
upon those general reforms which have been
recommended by the Secretary of the Navy; and
they have called upon him to suggest a single re-
form, which lies at the basis of all others. He
has done it; and the bill, as now reported, is, in
fact, the bill of the Navy Department, concurred
m by the committees of the two Houses. It em-
braces but a single feature, and involves no addi-
tional expenditure of money for naval defense. 1
desire to give notice to the Senate, without having
the bill made the special order for any particular
day, that I shall call it up at the very earliest
moment, deeming it of very great importance for
the efficiency of the naval service.
The bill was read a first time, and ordered to a
second reading. The report was ordered to be
printed.
BRTG GENERAL ARMSTRONG.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I desire now to make the
motion, of which 1 gave notice on Friday, to re-
consider the vote on the engrossment of the bill
for the relief of the claimants of the private armed
