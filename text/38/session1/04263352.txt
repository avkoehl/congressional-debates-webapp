Mr. HOOPER, I move to amend the amend-
ment of the Senate by striking out the word?:,
the* iJiiht to retain in his custody and pos*es-
iiioii, and lu-e for any lawful purpose," and in-
sertitt^ in lnu thereof the words t:any claim to
just i'uM|""jnsatioji for.,'
j\Ii. BltOOK-S. i hope that will not be agreed to.
The kSP^AKER. Tne frum May-
sacliusetts is enabled to the floor.
Mr. HOOPER. The object of that amendment
is to secure to the. Treasury Depaitinontthu light
to the plates which have been made for them, and
which they have paid for. But if the bank note
companies have claim on them this provides for
them just compensation. The object is to secure
the notes against counterfeits.
Mr. BROOKS. I hope the amendment of the
Senate will be non-concurred in without amend-
ment. The provision of the House for these fines
and imprisonments lias been stricken out, and now
if the House will concur in this amendment of the
Senate I think the bill will be tight. These dies
used by the bank-note companies, it will be re-
membered, are not used alone for engraving these
Tieasury notes; they are used for bank notes for
all p<u ts of the woi Id. The pi intin^ for the banks
of Canada, Nova Scotia, und New Brunswick is
done by the bank-note companies of this country,
i hold in my hand a note printed in Greek, for a
Greek bank in Athens, the seat of arts, the hii h
court of aichitecture and skill. Athens pays to
this country the high tribute of sending to our
artists and ustng our bank notes and dies. It is
an art that should he encouraged.
Here is another of ihcse notes which I wish
gentlemen to see. it is pi inted here foi the Bank
of Athens, Greece. Theie are do'is piinted in
the United Slates in the Russian nnd Sclavonic i.
tongues and other lan^un^es. Our artists now ;|
have the hij;h honot of printing bank notes for j
almost nil the countnes of the earth. The Senate I!
has presented to us an amendment that allows [
our artists fo continue their woik. That amend- j!
mont is n«ht and should pass. It is simply to ■[
allow the bank note companies the use of their i|
dies and engravings. If I had supposed this dis-
cussion would come up I could have brought to ji
the observation of the House bank notes printed !j
for banks in Canada, Colombia, Peru, Russia, ;l
and almost all countries. They send to our bank
note companies because the wotk is performed
belter by them than anywhere el.se in the wotld.
it is a high tiihufe paid fo our artists, and the
hetirfi' of it should not be taken Iron) litem. I
hope the Senate amendment will be concuned in
without any alteration whatever.
Mr. flOlH'&R. Mr. Speaker, I do not pro-
pose fo prolong tins discussion. 1 have two other
amendments to oiler, one to confine this to the
printing; of notes and bonds, the other to make
compensation to parlies who have any interest vn
patents that are affected by it. I now move to
amend by inserting after the word " person*' the
words <4exeepton notes or bonds,"
The mnemlment was rejected.
Mr. flOOPKIv. I move to amend the amend-
ment of the Senate by uihci ting at tin* end thereof

PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Mr. A. W. CLARK obtained the floor.
Mr. TODD. Will the gentleman yield to me
for a personal explanation ?
Mr. A. W. CLAliK. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. TODD. Mr. Speaker,! rise to a personal
explanation. On the 11th instant the House de-
cided that 1 was the legally elected Delegate for
the Tuaitory of Dakota after a somewhat ex-
tended debate. During this discussion the late
sitting Delegate asked and obtained leave of the
House to print the speech he had prepared, but
which he did not deliver. In that i find the fol-
lowing paragraph, and ask the Clerk to read it:
The Cleik read, as follows:
to anv personal allusions the contestant has feed
propej io make, or any attempt to connect uic with nay of
the handuleiit voting, I have only tins to &ay, that it 13
wholly false; and 1 may as well say that I have too much
ie-pcet ioi my character to notice, care, or concern mv^elt
about un\ Mich attempts at slaiidei. coming I'lom a man
who le-nriied Ins place, so -avs icpoit, from tear of being
diMiu—erf Uom tiie Aim) tot cowaidice; coming ftoui a
man wlio-e name the dome.-nc influence ot tin1 White
llou-o h is ilnec time.-' induced the Ex<-< unvc of tlx* Uintt d
States R'iuctantly to head to the Senate for confirmation
as a hi i^uliur genejal, and who has three tunes met with a
piompt iciusdl by the Senate, 1 should scot a to notice
au\ petMmal M'inatks coming fiom any one bcaiiny the
name of the eouie.siant, (Todd,) a lamily somewhat iioto-
thuH lot ihen love of office. If they cannot get office under
l're-jdcn! Lincoln, they take it under JcfT. Davit,.1'
Mi. TODD. The gentleman waxes very in-
dignant at being chaiged with bribery or an at-
tempt to connect him with any fraudulent voting,
nnd boldly pronounces the accusation false; yet
the proof is conclusive and comes from four dif-
ferent witnesses, in different parts of the Terri-
tory, who hud no collusion and no motive for
false swearing. Ills denial, unsupported by any
evidence, is wiiat might bo expected from one
detected and exposed as he lias been. He took
advantage of the indulgence of the House to utter
imputations which have no foundation in fact,
and which ho dared not express in his place,and
then had the discretion to leave the city before
the Globe containing if was published. At the
time it made its appearance I was confined to my
room by illness,nnd, as it has alifhe merits of a
covert and clandestine attack, ! have deferred
noticing it until I have felt well enough to do so.
He bungs a grave charge against me, and bases
it upon report. On what report, and how sup-
ported? Nothing, absolutely nothing, but the
mo'jt vngue and indefinite minor, of which he is
the author, and to whom the responsibility be-
longs. The charge is that I resigned from the
; Auny ftom fear of being dismissed for coward-
ice. Sir, the good name of along service in the
Army of the country is not, 1 trust, to be sulhed
by the malignant voice of detected fiaud and dis-
appointed ambition.
Appointed fiorn the State of Illinois, I graduated
at the Military Academy at West Point in 1837.
In the fall ofthat year I joined the Army in Flor-
ida, and continued in that arduous and thankless
seivtee until J8ik2, when the Seminole war was
closed by General Worth. From that period I
served upon the frontiers of Texas and Arkan-
sas, until 'he campaign opened before Vera Cruz,
and only terminated with the fall of the City of
Mexico, thiough which I served. 1 then on the
return of tiie Army to the United States was
stationed on the Upper Mississippi, m Minne-
sota, until 185-1, and in 1855 I took an active part
m the campaign of General Harney against the
Sioux Indians of the Plains, and in the following
yeat, 1656, wit en all was peace, I resigned my com-
mission in tiie At my after twenty years' service,
and settled in Dakota, where I have resided ever
since.
Let us see what opinion General Harney held.
