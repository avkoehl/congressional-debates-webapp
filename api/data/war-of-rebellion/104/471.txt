HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, April 26, 1865.

Major-General WILSON,

Macon, Ga.:

The terms of the armistice between General Sherman, U. S. Army, and General Johnston, C. S. Army, are disapproved and repudiated by the United States, and orders have been accordingly issued that all U. S. commanders push to their utmost all military operations in which they were engaged at the time of the armistice above referred to. If they were engaged at the time of the armistice above referred to. If General Cobb refuses to surrender Macon to you after the reception of this message, the people cannot complain, whatever may be the consequence, should you be compelled to assault the place. I have received authority to offer the enemy in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi the same terms as those agreed upon between Generals Grant and Lee, viz: First. General Wilson, U. S. Army, or such officer as he may appoint, is designated to receive the surrender. Second. Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer designated by General Wilson, the other to be retained by such Confederate officer as may be designated by the Confederate commander at the time of the surrender. Third. The officers to give their individual parole not to take up arms against the United States Government until properly exchanged, and each company, battalion, or regimental commander to sign a like parole for the men under his command. Fourth. All arms and public property to be stored and parked and turned over to an officer to be named by Brevet Major-General Wilson to receive them. This will not embrace the side-arms of officers nor their private horses or baggage. Fifth. This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be disturbed by the military authorities of the United States so long as they preserve their parole and obey the laws which were in force previous to January 1, 1861, where they reside. These terms were forwarded to you by way of Decatur and Mobile. You are authorized to propose them to the military command in either of the three States named, and, if acceded to, receive the surrender.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

Your dispatch of yesterday, containing General Wofford's note to General Judah, was received this morning. Did you send the dispatch to General Wofford which I sent some days since offering the same terms as General Grant gave to Lee? You are authorized to say to General Wofford that those are the best terms we can offer him, and that I expect him to forward to General Wilson your message that the Government had disapproved and repudiated the terms granted by General Sherman to Johnston, or permit you to send the message under flag of truce. Have a party prepared at once and send the following to General Wilson.*

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
