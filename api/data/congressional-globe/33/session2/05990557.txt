CHAMPAGNOLE LAND DISTRICT.
Mr. SEBASTIAN, by unanimous consent,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill to
change the boundary of the Chanipagnole land
district, in the State of Arkansas; which was read
a first time, and ordered to a second reading.
Mr. SEBASTIAN. This bill merely proposes
a slight alteration til the boundaries of two land
districts in the State of Arkansas, and is in con-
formity witti the expressed wish of the Legisla-
ture of the State. 1 hope, therefore, that wittiout
reference, it will now be considered. 1 ask the
unanimous consent of the Senate for that purpose.
Mr. STUART. 1 have no objection to the bill
if the Senator can state that it is agreeable to the
wishes of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office. It is customary to send these bills to the
Commissioner.
Mr. SEBASTIAN. I thought that unneces-
sary, as the bill proposes merely a slight altera-
tion for convenience.
Mr. STUART. I have no objection.
By unanimous consent the bill was read a sec-
ond time, and considered as m Committee of the
Whole, k proposes to delach a small portion of
country from the Little Rock district, and attach
it to the Champagnole district.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I do not wish at all to in-
terfere with the bill of the Senator from Arkansas,
but 1 should like to be informed by him if it has
been submitted to the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Oilice, or if that officer is aware of the
proposed change?
Mr. SEBASTIAN. I said before, but proba-
bly the Senator from Louisiana did not hear me,
that 1 had not submitted it to the Commissioner,
because I thought that unnecessary, as the bill
only makes a very slight alteration mthebounda-
ries of two land districts. Its only effect is to
take a small tract of country, four townships in
length, by two in breadth, from the Little Rock
district, and attach it to the district of lands sub-
ject to sale at Champagnole. It is in conformity
with the expressed wish of the Legislature of the
State.
Mr. JOHNSON. It is merely to save the
people of thatsection of the State from some unne-
cessary travel.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I have no objection to th*
bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a thirtf
reading, read a third time, and passed.
LAND OFFICERS AT VINCENNES.
Mr. PETTIT, by unanimous consent, asked
and obtained lfeave to introduce a bill to continue
temporarily the offices of register and receiver at
Vincennes, Indiana; which was read a first time,
and ordered to a second reading.
Mr. PETTIT. I beg the indulgence â€¢of the
Senate for a moment, while I state the reasons for
this bill, and ask for its immediate consideration
and passage. An act of Congress, passed in 1840,
provides that when the lands in any district shall
be reduced below one hundred thousand acres, the
land district shall be suspended, and the books and
archives, and all the papers of the land office re-
moved to the seat of government of the State. The
quantity of lands in the Vincennes land district
has been reduced below that amount, and an
order has been issued for the removal of the books
and papers of the office to Indianapolis in our State.
Last year we passed a law, which was approved on
the 27th of July, providing forthe investigation and
confirmation of certain private land claims under
grants of the Government as far back as 1792,
and created the register and receiver of that land
office commissoners for the hearing of those claims,
and allowed until the first of June, I believe, for
making and filing the claims, and after that they
are to be adjudicated by these two officers, having
all the records, this being, as you know, sir, the
oldest land office in our State, where there were
French claims and French disputations. It now
becomes absolutely necessary, in order to carry
out that law, that these officers should remain there
for a short length of time. This bill has been pre-
pared by the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and I have a letter from him recommending
its passage, but I presume it is not necessary to
read it. Under the circumstances which I have
stated, I ask that the bill may now be considered.
There being no objection, the bill was read a
second time and considered as in Committee of
the Whole. It proposes to continue theoffices of
register and receiver at Vincennes, until after a final
report shall have been made by the commission-
ers, pursuant to the act of Congress of July 27,
1854; and that the act of June 12, 1840, for the
discontinuanceofland officesundercertain circum-
stances, shall not apply to the office at Vincennes
until the services required by the act of July 27,
1854, shall have been performed.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read a third time, and passed.
SWAMP AND OVERFLOWED LANDS.
Mr. STUART. I have a report to make from
the Committee on Public Lands on a subject
which I think should receive the immediate action
of the Senate. That committee have instructed
me to report back the House bill for the relief of
purchasers and locators of swamp and overflowed
lands, with an amendment. Two bills of this
character have already passed the Senate during
the present Congress, and gone to the House of
Representatives; but the House have passed ano-
ther bill of their own and sent it here. In order
to secure action upon the subject, which is one of
very great importance to individuals as well as to
the States, I hope ihe Senate will indulge me by
agreeing to the request, which the Committee
desired me to make, for present action on the sub-
ject.
Mr. GWIN. It can come up in the morning
hour to-morrow or next day. 1 must object to
its consideration now, because I wish to make
a motion of importance in regard to the Pacific
railroad bill. 1 hope the Senator will allow the
bill which has been reported to lie over until to-
morrow morning, by which time it can be printed.
Mr. STUART. Of course the bill m-ust go
over if objection be made.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. GWIN. 1 now move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of the Pacific railroad
bill, which waa reported at the last session, and'
