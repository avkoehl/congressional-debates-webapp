CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
- building of a school or eoUege, such as was suggested
.by his friend from Ohio [Mr. Tappan] and the com-
mittee on the part of the Senate recommending' it.
It being, impossible to reconcile them, this course
■earns to have been adopted: each committee re-
ported a bill/ That which was reported to the Sen-
ate was laid upon the table, by a vote of 20 to 15, as
"will be seen by reference to the Congressional Globe
of that date.
This was Mr. Robbing's proposition for establish-
ing a national university; and his (Mr. Choate's)
honorable colleague, [Mr. Adams,] if he might so call
him, in the other House—the chairman of the com-
mittee—made a report which put an end to this mat-
ter.
The question now before the Senate was not
■whether we should apply this fund to a great na-
tional university—a university that should be
■worthy the name—which should fill that great spa^e
' between the college and the profession—in which
' the highest branches of education were to be taught,
and which should form and elevate the American
mind. That was not now the question, because
there was no such proposition before the Senate.
The honornble senator from Ohio proposed no such
splendid establishment; because he knew that to
maintain such a scheme as that would only be a
conspicuous absurdity, inasmuch as it would entail
a certainty of annual calls on Congress for large
appropriations, which would be invariably refused.
He therefore builds his college upon a much lower
Bcale, and proposes to make of that college, in this
bill, a mere school for teaching a few. of the physical
sciences.
Without intending to trespass upon the time of
the Senate, he submitted that such an institution as
that would be entirely unnecessary. He did not
mean to say, in quite as strong terms, absolutely
unnecessary, but that it would be a complete wa3te
of means. In a late number of the North American
Review, he saw it was asserted that there are now in
the United States a hundred and seventy-three colle-
giate schools. No doubt there were at least a hun-
dred and fifty; and there were two in this District.
There was not a single one of the professorships
for which his honorable friend provided—except,
perhaps, that of agriculture and rural economy,
architecture, and political economy—that was not
taught in most of these schools.
An establishment of this kind would not, in his
opinion, come up to the promise in the title, of "an
institution for the diffusion and increase of knowl-
edge among men." Who would come from the
Southwest, and West, and the great central and
eastern regions, to learn navigation, astronomy, or
any of the sciences taught in every school around
them? Its students would be confined to the Dis-
trict, and perhaps to the few adjoining States; and
  bo far from being an establishment of general utility,
it would be nothing more than a dilution of what
already exists.
He meant, therefore, to move to strike from the
bill that part of it which proposed this mode of in-
creasing and diffusing knowledge among men, with
one exception—and for that he was obliged to the
honorable senator from Ohio—which was the pro-
vision authorizing the selection and enclosure of
grounds, upon which experiments might be tried in
foreign plants, exotics, seeds, &c. to ascertain
whether they would grow here, and be useful to
this country. If this motion should prevail, then
the whole question would be, What are we to do
with the Smithsonian fund? It was the application
of this fund that had induced him to trespass upon
the time of the Senate, and he had a proposition
of his own to offer, which he trusted would be
worthy of consideration. He adopted the provision
of the bill in relation to the corps of lecturers; but
he was not in favor of these lecturers being brought
here and settled down upon fixed salaries. They
should be men eminent m science and knowledge,
in literature, holding responsible situations else-
where, and brought here under the stimulation of
the great good that is to be effected—men of letters,
and public men, eminent in the service of their
country; and the subjects of these lectures should
be'suitable to an audience which is to consist of
•members of Congress, and their sons, officers of
"the government, and others, strangers and foreign-
ers who occasionally come to the seat of government
to see the national legislators in the Capitol of the
United States. . .
Believing it was the general desire of this body,
and of none more than the honorable senator from
Ohio, to expend this fund so as to make it most
available for the purpose for which it was designed,
he (Mr. C.) now proposed to appropriate twenty
thousand dollars of it every year, for twenty-five
years, or five hundred thousand dollars in all, for
the purchase of a great national library—not to be
chosen by a mere bibliomaniac—not by a man who
should waste it upon mere curiosities in literature
and musty manuscripts, of no intrinsic value,—but a
man of sound sense and learning, the approved and
accredited agent of the institution, appointed for the
purpose. 500,000 dollars of it thus expended, at the
present reduced prices of books, would give us the
best library in the civilized world. He did not
mean that it would be superior in the number of
books, but in the actual utility of them; nor did he
expect to compete with the old libraries in Europe in
point of the enormous collection of old volumes of no
practical use. It would not be a library of 700,000
books, as the library in Rome; nor five or six hun-
dred thousand, as the libraries in Munich; nor three or
four hundred thousand, as the libraries of Copenha-
gen, Vienna, and Madrid; because it was not by
large numbers that we were to make the best li-
brary.
Mr. C., after further entering into a statistical ac-
count of the libraries in Europe, resumed his propo-
sition. He held in his hand a work showing that,
for an expenditure of §7,000, six thousand books had
been purchased in Europe; and he believed that for
an expenditure of $500,000, a library as good, though
perhaps not so large, as the best in Europe, coifld
be purchased. The great want of such a library
was manifest. He would read extracts from the
North American Review, showing the actual neces-
sity for a collection of foreign books of history and
science.
" What public library in this country contains the mate-
rials for an accurate history of any one department of
science1? Take even the most limited, or rather one of the
most recent of all, the science ©f political economy. Here
our researches are confined to one definite period. We
have no dusty archives, to explore, no time-worn manu-
scripts to decipher. The origin of the science is within the
memory of our fathers, and we ourselves have witnessed its
t>udden growth and rapid developement. Yet how much is
to be done, how many authorities to be weighed, how many
different treatises to be analyzed and'eompared, before we
can venture to say—here is the history, for such was the
rise, such the progress, such the changes of opinion, such
the received, and such the rejected theories of political
economy!"

"If such be the obligations of the student, whose re-
searches are confined to a subject so new, what must be the
necessities of the historian who attempts to throw light up-
on those periods, for which the testimony of printed au-
thorities is to be confronted with that of manuscripts and
public documents, and where ignorance and prejudice have
combined with the more powerful incentives of interest, to
perplex his path by contradictory statements and conflicting
opinions!" ©

"An extensive library, answering to the wants of the lit-
erary men who are to uf-e it, is essential to the public and
effectual promotion of learning In this country, the want
of large libraries is a serious discouragement of superior at-
tainments and accurate researches in almost every walk of
study. The time necessary for reading or examining a par-
ticular book is often consumed in attempts to discover or
obtain it; and frequently, after every effort, it cannot be pro-
cured. "We are obliged to give over our inquiries on sub-
jects, where we would arrive at fulness and exactness in our
knowledge, because destitute of the assistance, which the
learned, in the same track of study, have furnished,—or to
continue them under the disadvantage of ignorance lespect-
ing what has been done by others. Thus we are liable to be
occupied m solving ^difficulties which have been already
cleared, discussing questions which have already been de-
cided, and digging m mines of literature which former
ages have exhausted. Every one, who has been 111 the way
of pursuing any branch of study m our country beyonl the
mere elements, or the polite and popular literature of the
time, knows how soon the progress is often arrested for
want of books. This is not the case merely with persons of
moderate means, who are unable to purchase a library of
their own, but it ie a want felt under the most favorable cir-
cumstances."
Who would say that euch a disposition of the
Smithsonian fund was not in strict accordance with
the design of the bequest? The object is to increase
and diffuse knowledge among men; and is not a
great public library one of the best possible means
of effecting this object?
The effect of the proposition of the honorable
senator from Ohio would be a disbursement of the
fund without any palpable benefit to show for what
it was expended. But a library was a permanent
and lasting property, which would show for itself at
all future times.
Mr. C., at great length, expatiated on the benefits
and importance of a great national library, such as
he contemplated and recommended. He urged that
the intellect of Americans wa§ not inferior to that of
Europe} but its aliment was. It was the highest
aspiration of his ambition to see American mind
cope with that of the most gifted in any land; This
could only be done by placing within its reach the
same nutriment—the accumulated wisdom and re-
searches of the whole world of mind. A great, a
providential, an extraordinary and peculiarly happy
and appropriate facility—on opportunity that never
would, in all human probability, occur again—now
presented itself of accomplishing what was so ar-
dently desired—the formation of a national li*
brary in the New World second to none in the Old
World.
He concluded by moving the following amend-
ment:
Strike out the 8th section, and insert
Sec. 8. And whereas an ample and well selected public
library constitutes one of the permanent, constant, and
effectual means of increasing and diffusing knowledge
among men; therefore
Be it further enacted, That a Sum not less than $20,000 be
annually expended, of the interest of the fund aforesaid, ia
the purchase of books and manuscripts for the formation of
a library of the institution aforesaid; which, foriU extent,
variety, and value, shall be worthy of the donor of the said
fund, and of this nation, and of the age.
Mr. TAPPAN next addressed the Senate, but in
so low a tone of voice that only detached sentences
of his remarks could be heard in the gallery. He
was understood to argue that there was no necessi-
ty for striking out the eighth section, or materially
altering the bill, as it was not incompatible with
its provisions to engraft upon it a modification of
the proposition submitted by the senator from Mas-
sachusetts. If a library on a liberal scale, such ag
the senator desired, was deemed proper, it would
be only necessary to add a section to that effect to
the bill, striking out so much of the first section as
relates to the same subject. But he did not concur
with the senator from Massachusetts that a vast
and costly miscellaneous library would meet the ob-
jects contemplated by the donor of this munificent
fund. In addition to the general terms of his ex-
pressed will, that this fund should be applied to the
"increase and diffusion of kn«wledge among men,"
it was proper to inquire into the manner in which
he himself conceived this was best to be accomplish-
ed; and in this inquiry whatever instruction could
be gleaned from his own habits and pursuits should
not be disregarded, in the absence of other lights.
Mr. Smithson was an eminent practical philos-
opher, intimately acquainted with the practical
sciences—such as chemistry, mineralogy, geology,
and natural history—to the minute study of which
he mainly devoted "his life. His favorite resort was
the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, an institution in which
he found congregated all the elements furnished by
nature, art, ana science for pursuits congenial to his
own mind. There could be little doubt that, in ma-
king this bequest to the United States, he had in
view the establishment of some such institution as
the Jardin del Plantes in the Western hemisphere.
On this reasonable supposition the present bill wag
framed; and to show that it conformed closely to
that design he requested a description of that insti-
tution, which he sent to the table, would be read.
The description was accordingly read, but being
imperfectly heard the substance only is here given:
Jardin Royale des Plantes ou Jardin du Rot.—This
institution owes its origin to Guy de la Brosse, phy-
sician to Louis XIII. Richelieu, Secjuier, and Bul-
lion, intendants of finance, enabled him to foand a
botanic garden, and to lay down the plan, which his
successors carried to perfection. This germ grew
to maturity during the reigns ofLouis XIv andXV;
and the other departments owed their excellence of
arrangement to the celebrated Buffon during his su-
perintendence. His studies embraced all nature,
and he collected his materials from every portion of
the globe. Since his time, Dauberton completed the
whole plan, and raised the establishment to the
highest degree of perfection.
Distinguished professors exercise their talents in
gratuitous lectures on mineralogy, geology, general
chemistry, botany, agriculture, natural history, the
anatomy of man and animals, and iconography.
The building contains a copious library of works
of natural history, fine collections of preserved ani-
mal specimens, vegetables, minerals, complete herb-
aries, drawings of extraordinary merit, and a garden
judiciously and tastefully laid out, in which is com-
bined the cultivation of indigenous productions with
that of exotic plants. The productions of every re-
gion of the globe are preserved in extensive hot-
houses. There is a managerie, a superb botanical
garden, a splendid amphitheatre for lectures, and
