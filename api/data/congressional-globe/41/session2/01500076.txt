APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 2*7,
Ho. of Eeps.
Economy in Public Expenditures—Mr. Dawes.
41st Cong 2d Sess.
$200,720? Is it true that they hare expended
the whole of the appropriation made and the
whole unexpended balance of $10,000,000,
and are now short $200,720?
Mr. Chairman, another reason given for the
cutting down was that the gentleman who was
then at the head of the Committee on Appro-
priations (Mr. Washburne) was seeking for a
little reputation as the bull-dog of the Treas-
ury in the line of economy. The other gen-
tleman was not in the line of economy. No;
he was in the line of free expenditures of unex-
pended balances. What he did in the way of
cutting down the estimates was not in the line
of economy, but while he was in the other line
his chairman was winning or trying to win a
reputation as an economist by cutting them
down with him hand in hand.
Now, sir, I alluded but once more to the
estimates and appropriations, and it was in
these words:
"X have a right to complain of the other end of
the avenue, that with all its professions of economy
and reduction of unnecessary force in the Depart-
ments, with all the heralding by telegraph or other-
wise of its purpose of reduction, there is not one of
these Departments that does not estimate to-day, in
thobooklhavebefore me, foranincrease of expend-
iture over the appropriations of last year, save only
one, and that is the poor, unpopular Attorney Gen-
oral."
Was that true ? If gentlemen who have their
books of estimates will turn to the recapitulation
at the end and follow the statement that I am
about to make they will see whether it is true.
I begin with the legislative department, page
242: Senate, salaries and contingent, excess
$55,524 ; House of Representatives, salaries
and contingent, excess $136,320 60; Congres-
sional Printer, excess $532,572 83 ; Libarian
of Congress, the estimate is precisely the same;
Court of Claims, excess $903,500; total excess
of the legislative department, $1,627,917 43 ;
executive proper, excess $940; State Depart-
ment, excess $32,520 ; Treasury Department,
excess $8,431,613; Department of the Inte-
rior, excess $13,549,167 58; War Department,
excess of estimates, $5,621,892 42; Navy De-
partment, excess of estimates, $12,485,095 37;
Agricultural Department, excess of estimates,
$110,630; Post Office Department, excess of
estimates, $7,759,871 21 ; but this should be
just $7,000,000 less, or $759,871 21 ; total
excess of estimates for the executive depart-
ments, $47,991,729 68, In the Attorney Gen-
eral's office instead of an excess we have a de-
crease of $3,600; excess of estimates of judi-
cial department, $92,890; grand total of excess
of estimates $49,682,537 01, which should be
just $7,000,000 less, or $42,682,537 01.
Those were the words I used the other day;
are they true ? I submit to gentlemen whose
patience I know I have almost exhausted
whether in this last item I stated otherwise than
is found in the book. Now, sir, I have gone
through with all the figures I used, and I do not
fear the judgment of the country upon this
vindication. But I will carry this a little fur-
ther, and for a moment reen force the statement
I made in that speech. If anything will be a
test whether there be a tendency up or down
in the expenditures of any of these Depart-
ments it will be the two items of salaries and
contingent expenses, and I propose to test this
statement of mine by a reference to those two
items.
I ask gentlemen to listen to me and see
whether the items of salaries and contingent
expenses as estimated for in this book show
an upward or downward tendency. I read
from pages 242, 243, and 244 of the book of
estimates: executive proper, salaries, and con-
tingent, excess of estimates $940; State De-
partment, salaries and contingent, excess of
estimates $38,520 ; Treasury Department,
salaries and contingent expenses, excess of
estimates over the appropriations of last year
$259,090 ; Department of the Interior, salaries
and contingent expenses, excess $88,868. The
War Department istheother way. On salaries
and contingent expenses the War Department
stands out as asking $6,450 less this year than
itasked forlastyear. In the Navy Department
the salaries and contingent expenses are in
excess $56,670. The Agricultural Depart-
ment, salaries and contingent expenses, excess
$64,630. The Post Office Department, sala-
ries and contingent expenses, excess $30,800.
The total of the excess for salaries and contin-
gent expenses in these Departm en ts is $523,408.
I submit the pages 242,243, and 244 herewith:
