HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 18, 1864-2.15 p. m. (Sent 2.25 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

Major-General Butler informs me* that the enemy's pickets at Bermuda Hundred reported Petersburg evacuated last night, or was to be to-night. The formed fact, I am aware, has proved unreliable, but I wish you would caution your officers to be on the qui vive, in case the enemy does retire, to give us the earliest information.

Major-General.
