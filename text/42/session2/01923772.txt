ment. He made a report upon all those claims
that were on file in the Department at the
commencement of this session of Congress.
The bill only provides for those that were on
file when he made this report and according
to the report that is now here.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The Senator does not
answer my question as to how lately some of
the claims have been filed.
Mr. CORBETT. A portion of the claims
may have been filed within twelve months,
although I am not positive that there has been
one; but they could have been up to the time
this report was made. Any that may have
been filed in the Department up to the time
the report was made can be paid. That is my
answer.
Mr. SAWYER. It is obvious this bill can-
not pass this morning without a great deal
of discussion, and claims that are seventeen
years old I think can wait a few days longer.
Mr. CORBETT. That is the reason why
the bill ought, to pass now.

South Carolina demands the regular order.

States, upon which the Senator from South
Carolina [Mr. Sawyer] is entitled to the
floor. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
Cameron] appeals to him to yield for a
motion to proceed to the consideration of
executive business, allowing this bill to remain
as the unfinished business.
Mr. SAWYER. 1 understood that this bill
â€¢was to come up at this time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is up ; but
the Senator from Pennsylvania now desires
to .go into executive session.
Mr. SAWYER. I do not des ire to oppose
my wish to that of the Senate, but [ prefer we
should finish this bill before the motion is
made for an executive session.
Mr. CAMERON. I hope the question will
be put to a vote of the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from South Carolina yields, the Chair will
recognize the Senator from Pennsylvania to
make the motion; if he does not, the Chair
will recognize the Senator from Pennsylvania
after the Senator from South Carolina con-
cludes.
Mr. SAWYER. I will yield to allow the
motion to be made if the Senate desires to go
into an executive session.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from South Carolina desires the Senate to
consider the labor commission bill at this
time, but yields to allow the question to be
put on the motion of the Senator from Penn-
sylvania. The question is on the motion of
the Senator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I ask for the yeas and nays
on the motion to go into executive session.
The yeas and nays were not ordered, but
five Senators rising to second the call.
