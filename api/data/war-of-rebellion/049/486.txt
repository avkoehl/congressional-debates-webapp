The road from the position of my division to Ross' Mills is entirely different from that direct from Brandy Station. From here it is in passable condition. From Ross' to Turner's, three-fourths of a mile: Good.

Thence to a main road, 1 1/2 miles: Two deep holes, easily repaired.

Along that main road to Madden's, 2 1/2 miles: Good.

At Madden's take right hand for 2 miles to forks: Half dozen bad places.

At forks take right hand to plank road, 2 miles: Good.

Follow plank road 400 yards and take right-hand road, which is not good, but which leads to Jacobs' Ford in 1 1/4 miles. *

The officer sent by me reconnoitered as far as where the track to Jacobs' Ford leaves the plank road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY PRINCE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

P. S. -The officer rode to Jacobs' Mills and talked with the miller, who says that this evening, by a mark which he knows, the water at the ford is half way up a horse's side, and too deep for men to ford. The cavalry pickets of the enemy were on the other side.
