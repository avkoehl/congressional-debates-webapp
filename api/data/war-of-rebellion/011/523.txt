HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE WEST,In Camp, near Corinth, Miss., May 15, 1862-12 p.m.

[General BEAUREGARD:]

GENERAL: Your message in regard to my picket just received. I have sent out to inquire in regard to it. Colonel Bradfute informs me that his orders to the regiment were to fall back on the Danville road, to the works on that road by General Jones' headquarters; that the regiment was stationed at the intersection of the roads. He has been sent out to examine into it and to rectify the mistake, if any.

Reports of my scouts this evening confirm the first report, that the enemy are fortifying near the mill on Seven Mile Creek. Nothing has been seen of them this side of Farmington. Country people report that they are concentrating in force about 7 miles north of Farmington.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, May 15, 1862

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Cumberland Gap:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to state to you that he has received information of a large body of the enemy being engaged near Cumberland Gap in clearing a road across the mountains.

He desires that you get all possible information as to whether these reports are well founded. Brigadier General S. M. Barton has been directed to examine the country between his position and yours. The commanding general desires that you co-operate with him as far as you may, be able, and also have the country on your right examined, as he is apprehensive of an attempt on the part of enemy to turn your position in that direction.

It is reported that the principal part of the force above referred to consists of refugees from Tennessee, who are employed by the United States Government, and work day and night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. CUNNINGHAM,

Acting Aide-de-Camp.
