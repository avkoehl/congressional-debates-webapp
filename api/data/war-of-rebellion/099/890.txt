GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS, No. 18. In the Field, N. C., March 18, 1865.

The general commanding wishes to convey to the officers and men under his command his high appreciation of their zeal and industry during the present campaign. The labor required in moving our trains during the west weather and the bridges destroyed by the enemy, which it was necessary to rebuild, has been very arduous, but performed with the utmost cheerfulness. He is proportionately displeased with the conduct of the commanding officers of the two regiments, Eleventh and Thirteenth Iowa, assigned to the train yesterday. Instead of using their force to repair the roads and having the train in at 8 o'clock, as it should have been, they left it stuck in the mud and moved their command into camp. This culpable neglect not only delayed our own train until near midnight, but was a great annoyance to the division moving in our rear. This order will be rear to the command as soon as practicable after its receipt.

By order of Bvt. Major General Giles A. Smith:

[AD. WARE, JR.,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
