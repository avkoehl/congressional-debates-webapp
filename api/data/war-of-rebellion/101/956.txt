COLONEL: The ferry-boat has stopped running on account of the fog and several of our wagons belonging to the troops and en route for Pensacola, are left on this side. They will be sent over early in the morning. This will also prevent the teams of the two regiments ordered to Half-Way House. The regiments had better remain here till morning.
