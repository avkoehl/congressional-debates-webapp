Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Telegram received. It is necessary that I go to Philadelphia to- morrow, but as soon as I organize the regiments at that please and put them en route, will return to this city. Major Roy Stone, Thirteenth Resume Corps, was detailed on the recruiting service. By great activity has raised one entire regiment of Bucktails, which this afternoon was organized. The major marches with the regiment, and the Governor desires to commission him as colonel. Can he be authorized to do so?

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

His Excellency Governor CURTIN,

Can you raise any cavalry immediately? How many regiments could you raise in twenty days?

By order of the Secretary of War;

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

GENERAL GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Independent forces can be organized here and from here east to Decatur. Shall they be accepted and received into the service? I am only in favor of it when they go into our old organizations.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

Your dispatch received. I had calculated on the call of 500,000 men. Not one with had been furnished, but the Adjutant-General's records are defective. The duplicate rolls here show we had furnished before July 2 nineteen regiments infantry and three of cavalry, twelve batteries artillery, one detached company cavalry, and one of sharpshooters, making in the aggregate 24,653 men . This is a surplus of 2,900. You have promised to credit us this, and I have so published to the people. The neglect of army officers to fill our regiments should not operate to our disadvantage.

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.
