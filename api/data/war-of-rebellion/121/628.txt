The treatment adopted in all forms of the disease (when we have it) is tonics, such as quinine, tincture of iron, salix alba, eupatorium, perfoliatum, and such other indigenous remedies as we can obtain from the woods. We are now making some experiments with a decoction of the baptisiatinctoria, which grows abundantly around the hospital. As local applications we use pure nitric acid, nitrate of silver, tincture of iodine, oleum terebinthinae, and Darby's prophylactic fluid, followed by emollient poultices made of pulverized line, or a common mush poultice made by thickening a strong decoction of quercus rubra with corn-meal.

We will give you a tabular statement of the patients received into and treated in our ward alone for the past three months, with the result. We regret not being able to do the same for the whole hospital.

In the month of August we had in the fifth ward twenty-one operations of all kind. Out of these cases we had ten deaths, mostly attributed to either diarrhea or dysentery, while only two or three were caused by recurrence of the gangrene in the stump.

It will be seen by the above statement that we treated in a little over three months 325 patients, and out of that number 208 have died, 47 were transferred to other wards, 13 were detailed for duty in hospital as nurses (after they were cured), and 11 wee sent to quarters (cured), which leaves us 50 still in the ward (October 5), and out of the 50 there are 2 or 3 about well, 4 or 5 convalescent, and the remainder pretty bad off.

In September we had 11 operations for the same condition, of which 7 died from diarrhea and dysentery. The whole number of operations for the two months (August and September) were 38, of which 17 died, 9 were transferred to other wards, 6 are convalescent in the ward, and we know of 4 or 5 others who were transferred to other wards, and who are also convalescent. The deaths as far as known are reported in the above.

We will now give you a case of what we took for true hospital gangrene. J. Mailer, aged twenty-four years, admitted August 5, with a large sphacelus covering the whole arm up to within two and a half
