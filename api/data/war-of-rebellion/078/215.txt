course of action could not be taken at the same moment in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. This, however, would require a military force which the Government has not probably at its disposal at present in those States.

The inclosed letter* I take from that of General Burbridge to yourself, before referred to in the hope that it may be in your power to give it early and favorable consideration. The matter discussed has produced a deep feeling in the WEST and General Burbridge feels great solicitude in regard to it. Were an assistant adjutant-general stationed at Louisville he could at once perfect the discharge of this numerous class of disabled soldiers, whose pitiable condition demands, from every consideration of humanity and duty, the kindly action of the Government.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

You can arrest Judge Bullitt and turn him over to General Burbridge on the latter's requisition; also Dick Barrett from Saint Louis, on General Rosecrans' requisition. Do not arrest any others, as their cases are in the hands of the Government.
