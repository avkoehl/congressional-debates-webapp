in a trade or factors', the daily wages of men are
from 30 to48 cents, and often rise to 60cents. Miners
at tunneling are frequently paid 72 cents,(one thaler;)
in the district of Gorlita, a brick-maker aided by his
wife averages 80 cents per day; in the district of
Pauer from $5 76 to $7 20 per week. Skilled work-
men of large experience receive from $360 to $432
per annum. The wages of the molders and enainel-
ers in iron founderies, of the locksmiths and joiners
in machine-works, in piano factories, amount to fr<" m
72 cents to $1 08 per day; the some in manufactories
of glass, silverware, watches, and hat factories. The
hignest wages paid to a very skillful joiner in a piano-
forte factory were $12 24 per week.
Wages for female labor are more uniform through-
out; 18 cents per day can bo earned by a skillful
hand, 24 cents per day very rarely.
Juvenile laborors in factories begin with wages of
48 cents per week, for 10 hours' work daily, and rise
to 72 cents per week. The law prohibits the employ-
ment of children under 12 years of ago ; from 12 to 14
years it permits 6 hours', and from 14 to 16 years, 10
hours' daily labor.
The general average of daily wages is as follows:
males, for 12 hours'work per day, in the country,
192 cents: in cities, 24 cents: harder labor,30 cents ;
in cities, 36cents; skilled labor, 60 cents.
The wages of master workmen, overseers, &e., are
not included in the above average, but are at least
$172 per annum.
In regard to the time of work, laborers in factories
are employed 11 to 12 hours i>er day, (exclusive of
. time for meals;) where work is continued day and
night, the hours for the day are from 6 to 12 a. m.,
and 1 to 7 p.m.; for the night, from 7 p,m. to 6 a. m.,
■with £ hour recess ; in a few districts 10 hours con-
stitute a day's work. In many cloth factories and
wool spinneries, males and females work 12 to 13
hours, and some even 16 hours per day. As an ex-
ample, a cloth factory employs firemen and machin-
ists 16 hours, spinners and dyers 14 hours, all others
12 hours, exclusive of time for meals. In gla?s-works,
the nature of the work requires from 16 to 18 hours for
melters, 13 to 15 hours tor blowers; but then one
party rests while the other works. Rye and potatoes
form the chief food of the laboring classes.
Savings.
Although but few workingmen can save any por-
tion of their earnings, still there are some who pur-
chase a little piece of land, a house, or a cow, and
the latest accounts from fifteen districts in Lower
Silesia show deposits in savings banks from house
servants of $428,455; of apprentices and mechanical
workmen of $124,522. No statistics of savings of fac-
tory workers were obtained. In some factories the
workmen have established savings banks, some of
which have deposits of from $8,000 to $l0,0u0.
DETAILED STATEMENTS OF THE WAGES AND COST OF
LIVlNG-IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OE LOWUR SILESIA.
1. District of Bolkenhain.
The annual expenses of a family of about 5 per-
sons, (3 children,) belonging to the working cla-ss,
were as follows:
Provisions, (per day, 0.144 to 0.16S,) per year.... §60 00
Rent, (8 thalers,)   5 76
Fuel .  3 60
Clothing, linen, &c  14 40

Taxes:State0.72;church 12;commune36, $1 20
School for 2 children  2 50
  3 70
Total  $94 66
The expenses of a laborer's family being 24 to 26.4
cents per day, the earnings should be 28 to 30.8 cents
per day, which the head of the family cannot earn.
While his earnings are from 17 to 19 cents, the wife
earns 8 to 10 centt, and the children must help as
soon as old enough. Miners in this district have 23
to 29 cents daily wages ; factory men from 19 to 29
cents; mechanics receive 48 to 54 cents per week,
besides board; male house servants ^17 to ?30, and
female $12 per annum, exclusive of board and lodg-
ing. -
2. District of Landeshut.

The income of laborers' (weavers') families does
generally not reach these amounts. Many are per-
mitted to gather their woud from the royal forests, and
spend little for clothing, which they beg from chari-
table neighbors. A weaver earns here from 48 to 72
ceuts, $1 and $1 50 per week ; most weavers have 2
looms in operation, and together with their wives
earn from $1 50 to $2 16 per week. The average
earnings of weavers are given at 96 cents per week
or about §50 per annum.
3. District of Uirschhug.
The lowest cost of living for a laborer's family is
given at $64 80 to $72 per annum, of which are ex-
pended for provisions $43 30, for clothing $17, taxes
S3 16, fuel $3 60, rent §5, <fce. In the summer the
wages for 12 hours' daily work, for males, are from
15 to 39 cents; for females, 5 to 17 cents per day; in
winter from 3 to 7 cents less. A male farm hand re-
ceivcs 812 to $22 per year; a boy $9 to $14; a maid-
servant §12 to $18 per annum, with board.
The annual expenses of a laborer's family, living
in a comfortable manner, without luxuries, would be
nearly double the amount actually expended above.
