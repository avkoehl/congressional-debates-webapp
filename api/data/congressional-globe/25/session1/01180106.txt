sitien, that that money should not be commanded
under one, two, or three jeirs
What was another argument connected with this
proposition' I' was lhat they might issue Treasury
draffs upon the banks, and suffer them to be pro
tested, and circulated ihrought the community, as
now, instead of notes Why, ji the first place,
they had heard from all quarters of the Union,
that the Secretary of the Treasury had no
right to issue drafts upon the banks, know-
ing they would be protested Eut suppose he
had the light, was there any difference between
those drafts now circulating and the Treasury notes
they proposed to issue' Where was the difference
between drawing a draft upon a bank, which they
knew would not be paid, but would be protested
and allow ed to circulate through the community
upon the credit of the Government, and aTieasury
note, which wast) cnculate exclusiiely upon the
credit of the Government, and with the belief that
the amount it represents will be paid the moment
the banks are m a condition to pa\ 1 Now if any
gentleman w as so astute as to be able to point rut
any difference—not the metaphysical, but die prac-
tical, d flerence—he would be glad to hear it Both
were certainly circulated on th  ciedit of the Go-
vernment
But it seemed that these notes, in the opinion of
some gentlemen, \iere unconstitutional, and then,
from all quarters, tiny weie told it was a loan—a
loan m disguise Well, if it be a loan, did not the
Constitution expressly aulhouze the Government to
borrow money for its needful want 1 If it be a
loan, as they admit it to be, and so Mr H admit-
ted, in one sense, but net m the ordinary sense in
which a louii was undeislood—but if it were, the
Const tution authorized them to bonow money
whenever the necessities of the country requned
them to do it How was it a loin' Why, it
wa? just such a loan as he would make to an
individual to whom he w?s mdebte', and who
called upon him for a settlement, and 1c
could not pay him, but give him his note
promising to pay him in a 3 ear In that sense, but
in no other, was it a loin, but no one would so un-
derstand it It was precisely that kind of transac-
tion too Those who had claims upon the Govern-
ment called foi then moneóme Government hid
not got it, because the meichants and the binks
could not pay her, and what does she do' Wl},
give her notes, and say she will pay up at the end
of a year This is a plain every day transaction
between individuals
Again, it nas said this b 11 would be a bm len
upon die people How a burden upon the people'
líe heard that complaint lung throughout the
House, and he a ked, how was it a bmden upon
the people' Did it propose my new tix upon

Did it take an) money out oi their pockets'! If

TREXSÜRY NOTES BILL
The Hou e then lesurned the consideration of the
" bill to authorize the issuing of Treasury notes,"
being the  substitute reported fiom the Comm tie- 
of the Whole on the state of the Union
The question pending was on the amendment of
Mr RHETT to amend the fir t section, as stated
in this moinmg s proceedings
Mr. PHILI IPS resumed his remai1 ¡> He en-
deavored to piove §«at the mo t injurious effects

tary of the 1 reasury in al'owmg a large amount oi
deposites to remain in several isolated banks, while
he withdiew nearly ihe whole sums deposited with
tre banks on the seaboard It wtts his opinion
that much of the distress now existing in the com-
mercial cit es was to be attributed to that meis re
He r^erred to tne prospt-cts ot the country foi the
ensuing jear, and con'ended, that from the íeport
of the Secretary, and the statements given in ihe
House, if i balance w ere drawn, tne rmount of dif-
ference between tne expéndame and receipts would
not exceed two or ihree hundred thousand dolíais

the paj ment of the fourth instalment of the depo-
sites would be the means ol distributing these noiec.
to the countiy But that measure had failed, and
with it a great poition of the ground for issuing
these notes
It was his onimon tiat specie pn\men's wojld

befoie the House w ere idopteu , and ht also w ished
it to be known that, in his opinion, the period of
di tresi had not passed over It still existed, and,
unler the pres nt state of things, must increase
Some srentlemen had attributed the distress to over-
tti din , but, althougn he would admit that m git
hav e had some influence, yet the great evil which
thej wcie called on to remedy was thit of obstruc-
t on to oui ciedit, both at home and abroad, and to
restore the cuirency to its tormer state, and the
banks to that confidence the) enjojed before the
susp"nsion of specie payment It was desirible
that they should mike the note of the bankb re

f^om Goveinmen', for, when such not s were so

no es were issued at all, he would suggest th° ex-
pediency of issuing them without, lather than with
interest

If the prop sition to sell had been brought for-

upon the ground that U would be wise to patt with
the bonds for whatevei they might bring, because
the bank bad not paid the first bond at mi'unly, n
would have been an argument that he co Ud under-
stand Mr II said that he begged to inquire fiom
the chairman of the Committee of \Ya5s and
Means whether the first bond, which was due on
the first of October, had been paid?
[Mr Cambrelfns replied, that no notice of its
pa)ment had been received, and that the Secietary
of the Treasury had been obliged to w rite to the
president of the bank about it ]
Mr H said that it was generally reported 'hat
the bank intended to se-off cei tain Tteasi r) war-
rants or drafts wh ch had been issued, in payment
of the third instalment, to soaie Sta'e under 'he de-
pos, te act, into the correc'ness of which step he
would not now entei, as A would lead him out of
his way
The wa^on why he mentioned it at all was to show,
that if the bank thought its<Jf entitled to di=ciarge
the first bond in this way, it migbt think it just to
pa) the others by the same se -off, because the
assignee of a bond would take it subject to all the
equity wmch attached to it n the hands of the
obi gee What would these bonds si.ll for at the
risk of being paid oñ in this mannei' hi, as tme
that we might direct otherwise by law , but then it
would be a harsh measure, depnve the bank if a
privilege which belonged to evei) boly ehe— hat
of pi)ing its debts to the Government n such
papei as was received from all olherpeisors If
this cou se had been recommended by th  Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, might it not have been
deemed severe, ai A lending to embarrass the
operations of the bank' B it to consider it strict-
ly as a financial measure, what did it amount
to' When we had to choose between using the
credit ot tie Government and the credit of the
bmk, wh} should we prefer t e later He
admitted thit the credit of that 1 sti ution
stood high, both m our own countiy and Europe,
and he had not tne slightest wish to impaii that
credit But it was not equal to that of the Go-
vernment Would the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts contend for this' He apprehended not
But let us follow out the operation Suppose the
bonds put up for sale m New Yoik la what mo-
ney would paj ment be requned' In specie, or
notes of non-specie paying banks' The existing
laws forbade the reception of the latter, and specie
must therefore be required Where would six
millions of dollars 111 specie come fiom' It would
be unwise to tempt the banks to bring it out of
their vaults, m order to purchase these bonds, be-
cause the abstraction of such a qu mtity would letard
a i esumption of specie pa) ments, v hich all agreed m
wishing to hasten Would the hoaids of individuals
be brought out, and v ested m these bonds' Perhaps
they might, but tney might moie reasonably be
expected to be enticed from their hiding places by
Government securities Even if the bonds should
be thus so cl, th° currency of the country would
remain just as it now is, and no facility be afforded
for lomestic exchanges, wh ch w as one great object
of the present bill Tieasury noes would be a
valuable addition to Ine existing circulating medium,
