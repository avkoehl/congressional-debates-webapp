Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

There is now a constant passing of troops across the river, going west, with artillery in proportion. Foster has taken another deserter, who reports all of Hill's corps, except one brigade, and part of Longstreet's corps in his front at daylight, with orders to march at a moment's notice. All quiet in this front.

Have just received a notice from Ord that raid on Weldon road is suppressed, and he takes his old position. Shall I recall Kautz? Can save him a thirty-mile march.
