REVISION OF THE SCHEDULES OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH LAST.

Since the adoption of our schedules for the months of February and March last the financial bills passes by Congress, taxing the currency, have seriously impaired the value of the old issue of Confederate Treasury notes. At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was a few days theafter to be taxed 33 1\3 per cent.

The Board of State Commissioners adjourned, and one of its members being out of the State, it could not be convened in time to review our schedule of prices. Under this state of facts we have re-examined and rearranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency. Therefore we assess the average value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the 17th of February last, at $600. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a first, second, or third class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement on the foregoing basis, but allowing to each person only such prices as first, second, or third class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, asssuming our average appraisement of $600 as a fair medium of valuation. This, then, would allow a maximum price of $800, and minimum price of $400, making $600 the average price-thus allowing more for first-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fall below the grade of first class. The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of $800 and our minimum price of $400. This plan, perhaps, would be most satisfactory to the people, for whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of $400 and our maximum price of $800, payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issues of Treasury notes.

The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisement for horses or mules impressed should in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensations as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper. But if, after this revolution and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered.

All appeals and communications, should be addressed, post-paid, Mr. D. K. Whitaker, secretary of the Board, box 995, Richmond post-office, Va., and who may be consulted at his office in the department of the Quartermaster-General.
