HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Bentonville, March 20, 1865-2 p. m.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch of yesterday is received. You can march into Goldsborough without opposition. General Terry is at Faison's and I have ordered him to Cox's Bridge till the present action is over. I am now within two miles of Slocum but Johnston is between us; we are now skirmishing. After occupying Goldsborough, if you hear northing to the contrary, join a part of your forces with General Terry's and come to me wherever I may be.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My troops will be at this place to-night, which is on the north bank of the Neuse, about midway between Kinston and Goldsborough. Unless I hear from you or get information indicating it to be unwise to do so, I will march for Goldsborough to-morrow. A troop of cavalry passed down the south bank this p. m., and I presume with dispatches from you or General Terry. If so, I will get them to-night.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
