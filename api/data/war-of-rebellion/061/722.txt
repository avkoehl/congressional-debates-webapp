HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, THIRD DIV., 7TH ARMY CORPS,Camp in the Field, near Moscow, Ark., April 13, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that on Sunday, the 10th instant, on the march from Elin's Ferry to Prairie D'Ane, having the advance of the Third Division, at 4 p. m. I came upon the cavalry division, which was halted in edge of the woods bordering the prairie. Large numbers of the enemy's cavalry and some artillery were deployed on the central ridge of the prairie running east and west, while the ridge in front commanding the point where the road enters the prairie was held by the enemy's skirmishers, concealed in the dense undergrowth covering the same. Battery A, Third Illinois Artillery,* was brought in position, commanding the first ridge. The Fortieth Iowa Volunteers being deployed to the right and the Forty-third Illinois to the left, as supports to the battery, the Twenty-seventh Visconsin being held in reserve, companies of the Fortieth and Forty-third were sent forward as skirmishers to develop the enemy. The enemy not appearing in force on the first ridge, the general commanding division having in the mean time come up, by his orders these two regiments were deployed as skirmishers and sent forward, while the Twenty-seventh was brought up to support the battery. The Forty-third, gallantly led by Lieutenant-Colonel Dengler, was the first to gain the high ground heretofore occupied by the enemy's skirmishers. They were closely followed by the Fortieth. The battery and the Twenty-seventh were now also brought forward, and while they were being placed in position the enemy opened on them with his artillery. The fire was effectively replied to by Captain Vaughn. The rebel artillery having been driven from its position, the Fortieth and Forty-third were, by order of the general commanding division, again advanced. These two regiments, driving the enemy steadily before them, soon gained the commanding position previously occupied by him. The battery and Twenty-seventh were now speedily brought up, and with the other regiments formed in line, the Fortieth on the right, resting against Lieutenant-Colonel Caldwell's brigade of cavalry, the battery in the center, supported to the right and left by the Twenty-seventh Wisconsin, the Forty-third on the left, resting on Brigadier-General Rice's command. Night had set in before this line was completed.

Having orders to make connection with the troops, both to my right and left, I was compelled to occupy and cover with skirmishers a greater extent of front than the limited number of troops under my command could well afford. During all this time a brisk fire was maintained from both sides by the skirmishers in my front. At about 8 p. m. the enemy again opened upon my position from a battery to the southwest, at 1,000 yards distance. It was reluctantly, but with good effect, replied to by my battery. Artillery and skirmish firing was kept up with some intermissions till 10 o'clock, when the enemy charged upon my battery from the direction of my right front, but were repulsed by the fire of the Fortieth and Twenty-seventh and several volleys of canister in quick succession by the battery. From that time on I was no longer molested, and the men were enabled to take such rest as lying in ranks on an open prairie of a frosty night, without fire, would grant them. I beg leave herewith to submit the reports of regimental and battery commanders. I would also refer to a report of the casualties already sent in, the
