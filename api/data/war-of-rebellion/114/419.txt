He did not tell me was going to tear up the railroad when at Sigler's. We never had any meetting of the company until we met at Laile's.

Answer There was not.

Question. When did your company commence tearing up the road?

Answer. At the section-house between Montgomery and Wellsville, about four miles east of there. I guess there were about twenty-five men. We worked toward Wellsville, burnt up part of the ties and broke part of the rails and burned the depot at Wellsville. We staind two hours at Wellsville.

Questin. Where did you go then?

Answer. A part came to Montgomery City and went home and a part went home from Wellsville. They went home just as soon as they pleased after the work was done-part of them did. Meyers ordered his men to go to Montgomery City and a part went; I did. When they got to Montgomery City they dsipersed. They got thogether since that at the same house in Laile's pasture, since the day before Christams. From there they went to Williamsburg-about sixty men. Went from there to Danville, then back to Williamsburg. I did not see Captain Owen or his company at either of these places. Cobb's company was when we got here. I don't know where Owen's company was. From Williamsburg went to Mount Zion Church. I don't know of Owen's company being Mount Zion Church and did not hear of their being there. My company broke up after the Mount Zion fight.
