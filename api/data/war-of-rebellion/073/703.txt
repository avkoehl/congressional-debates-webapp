June 26, moved out of works on Atlanta road and drove the enemy's skirmishers into works on the east side of Olley's Creek. Leaving the One hundredth and One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteers in position at this point, moved the Sixteenth Kentucky Volunteers, One hundred and twelfth Illinois Volunteers, Eighth Tennessee Volunteers on Powder Springs road to country or private road, passing farm owned by Mr. Cox, for the purpose of crossing Olley's Creek at this point and turning the position of enemy, but was prevented from so doing by an almost impassable swamp. Command bivouacked for the night. June 27, moved Eighth Tennessee Volunteers to the right of swamp this morning, after a heavy and well-directed artillery fire from Fifteenth Indiana Battery, Lieutenant Harvey, and a section of Twenty-third Indiana Battery, Lieutenant Wilber commanding, where they crossed. At about same time One hundredth and One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteers crossed on Atlanta road, and One hundred and twelfth Illinois Volunteers and Sixteenth Kentucky Volunteers on farm road before referred to, and drove enemy out of their works. The brigade is indebted for their success in a great measure to the movement of the Second Brigade, in threatening and pushing the right flank of the enemy during the time and previous to crossing. After crossing, brigade moved up Atlanta road about one mile to a favorable position and commenced fortifying same. June 28, 29, and 30, no change.
