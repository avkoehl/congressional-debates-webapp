CAMP near CANTON, MISS., Via Jackson, May 21, 1863.

The PRESIDENT:

Your dispatch of the 18th received, but cannot be deciphered. On account of heavy loss of artillery, we want field pieces, with harness and ammunition. Troops coming from the east are generally without artillery.

J. E. Johnston.

RICHMOND, VA., May 22, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Via Jackson, MISS:

Brigadier General John S. Bowen is appointed major-general, to meet the want specified in your dispatch. General Loring becomes available for assignment to the DIVISION you designate. Field batteries and small-arms are on the way to you command.

Signal cipher was employed. If you have the book formerly used by us, will resort to that.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., May 22, 1863.

General BRAGG, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

The vital issue of holding the Mississippi at Vicksburg is dependent on the success of General Johnston in an attack on the investing force. The intelligence from there is discouraging. Can you aid him? If so, and you are without orders from General Johnston, act on you judgment.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., May 22, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Via Jackson, MISS.:

I do not understand recommendation for promotion of Brigadier-General Wilson in your dispatch of 21st.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JACKSON, MISS., May 23, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

It was Brigadier General Cadmus M. Wilcox that I recommended. Major-General Loring is commanding his own DIVISION. Brigadier-General Bowen commands a DIVISION of the troops invested in Vicksburg. The DIVISION I mentioned a DIVISION of the troops invested in Vicksburg. The DIVISION I mentioned has no officer in it competent to command but Brigadier General W. H. T. Walker. It must be without a commander until a major-general is appointed for or assigned to it. We have tremendous odds against us. I respectfully urge, therefore, a thorough organization. I ceased to carry the book referred to upon being informed that the copy was not retained in your office. The enemy's gunboats have possession of the Yazoo.

J. E. Johnston.
