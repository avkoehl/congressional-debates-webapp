Major-General POPE,

Commanding Military Division of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: One section of the Second Kansas Battery is at Fort Scott, the other two sections here. I earnestly desire to have the section at Fort Scott ordered here. I have only one battery besides the two sections of the Second Kansas, which, in my opinion, is not enough. See General Orders, Numbers 15, War Department, 1864.

The officers in charge of the regiments marching north I am confident have done and are doing all in their power to push on. High water, deep snows, and cold weather have retarded their progress.
