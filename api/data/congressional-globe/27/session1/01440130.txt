that this bill wis most iniquitous and unjufetiu is operation
upon the people, especially of the people whom he in pin ie
ptesented, and ol whom he spoke with more confidence be
cause he liad more knowledge ol their condition, ^r 1 of their

gued that the bill w is one which would make the neh richer
at the expense of the poor, that it was in its operation unequal
and unjust, andtlutit ousht not to leceive the confidence of
this committee
lie was tlesitous however, to make himself fully understood
upon anotliei point in the argument, to which very buefly
and, to himself, unsatisfactorily, he hadre'ened m the opening
of his lemarks yttiteuliy, namely, the piewnt state ot the

by which that efficiency was to be made up, th it it might be
seen whethei he was right m maintaining i hat a Urge portion
of the duties to he imposed must fall upon the labo ing class
es rather than upon the moie wealthy He was among the
number ol those who looked upon all taxation as a burden, and
he had never bee ¡ able to hi nig his mind to die eonclusion that
the btst way to rehtve the people was to impose additional

which led him to the lesuH that, it this bill parsed, theie would
be a deficiency precisely to the amount of three and a half mil
lions We had exhausted the source of revenue to be derived
from luxuries because that would be required to supply the
other deficit How, then, was the amount appropriated by this
bill tobesuppliedi
Here Mr C went in'0 some calculations to foi tfy the posi-
tion he h id assumed ye¡=teiday, that no mote than five mil
lions could be raised fiom ill that portion of importations free
ofdutypiope ly denominated luxuries in contradistinction to
the neccs^aues of life, and to show thercfrtm what he believed
be the inaccuiacy of calculations wh.ch contemplate larger
amounts from this souice
Mr C also supplied certain omissions in his calculations
yesterday, as to the rates of duties on wines He-repeated that
he was in favor of th's duty, and said that were it not for
breaking in upon the punciples of the compiomise act, he
would be Willi lg to impose upon wines even a heavier duly
than twenty peí rent Ta^ the wine bibber as much as you
please 1
Mt C tl en proceeded lie had thus endeavored to esta-
blish, and had siti^fied himself that thi^ bill becamea law, and
th s amount of thiee and a half millions of dollars was to be an-
nually taken liom the Tieaimry, we weie inevitably driven to
tne necessity of ctrtying out the views of the honorable gen
tleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr >DAMol m the form of a pro-
tective tariff 01 the views of some uibei gentlemen, probably,
of restoring a heavy dut\ upon all the luxuries of life One of
thetwomust follow, and he had no doubt, if the bill passed,
which of the two it would be The gentleman fiom Massa-
chusetts would have theuiumph, and the tariff of 1828 would
again be saddled on the peoole of thi3 country If he felt au
thori7ed to do so, (which he did not,) he would appeal to
Southern gentlemen who were opposed to the tariff, to meet
this entering wedge upon the threshold
Let this gjhlen moment fleet away, and the Rubicon would
be passed—it would be too late Gentlemen might not call it
a piotective tariff, they need not call it by that name The
gentleman from Maivland [Mr Johnson] spoke of íaisinga
tanfffor revenue How? liy taking fiom the Treasury this
three and a half md ions  of dolíais, thus creating an occasion
foi a tariff, and then ca Hug it a tariff for re\enue There was
an old haying, from tome high quarter, that if we would not
change things, we could at least change their namps And m
thi  case we should only change the name ol the thing, for the
thing itself was, after all, a protective tariff
Mr C concluded by expressing the decided opposition oí his
own consumen s to a protective tariff, and his own opinion in
fivorof the lowest tai iff that was consistent with the most
economical adm nistiation of the Government

be distubuted by this Goveinmont according to the ratio laid
down even by the bill itself, and he ha I risen now to give a few
reasons why he should vote a he intended to do

a so many stump speechts were made in Con rt^« he(MrM)

though hew >uld not say that the gentleman had made attump
speech yet he wou'dsiy that, if theoiation had b*en on the

actly a stump speech

the geutlem in in relation tj this question He (Mr Clifford]
said that the Government p psessed a control ovei these pub-
lic lands, not deuved fiom any acts of cession, not derived
fiom any deed of grant 01 convt yance from the Sta es to the
Feoeial Government, but deuved exclusive!; fiom the Consti
tuiion ol the United States The gentleman had said he cared
not what night have been the teims originally of the¡>e aetsof
cession, that the Constitution was superior to them all, and that
therefoiethe General Government possessed supreme control
over the land He (Mr M ; would join issue with the gentle
man
[Mr CuFroBD explained He had quoted the opinions of
Messis Clay and Wubstei, ¿nd had ¡said that he was not willing
to centrad ct so high uithori y ]
Mr Mfriwether «aid he understood the gentleman as at-
firming the correctness of the views of Mes«is thy and Web

the Constitution Congress possessed absolute power, control
and right of dominion over and to this property—that they had'
aright to do with it as they pleased
He (Mi M ) would meet the gentleman on his own «rounds
and st e how fai they were «u&tamed by the Cons uuticn of the
United States and by the articles of cession themselves He
asserted that the act of cession settled the right ami title of the
United States to this pai tic dai property, and that the C «rititu
