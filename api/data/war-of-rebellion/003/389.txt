The troops which take the field under General Lyon will be joined by a force of 2,200 regulars and Kansas volunteers, under command of Major Sturgis, U. S. Army, at Osceola, Mo. The united command will then proceed towards Springfield, Mo.

Colonel Chester Harding, adjutant-general Missouri volunteers, will forward to Springfield the commissary supplies necessary for this command, in addition to that already in the field in that portion of the State. Colonel Harding is also charged with the duty of forwarding supplies for the troops that remain at this and other points on the river.

Special Orders, No. 1, dated June 29, 1861, from these headquarters, are so far modified as to authorize Colonel John D. Stevenson to retain at this post or at Jefferson City such companies of the Second Regiment as may wish to remain in the service for three years, but not necessarily in the regiment to which they now belong. Such companies will be reorganized at once and incorporated into regiments.

By order of General Lyon:

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Acting Adjutant-General.
