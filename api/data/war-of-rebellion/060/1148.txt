HEADQUARTERS, Chaffin's Farm, February 6, 1864.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy have not attempt to rebuild Diascond bridge, as the newspapers reported. A dispatch from Lieutenant Hume, commanding foot scouts, dated 10 a. m. yesterday, says that Colonel Spear, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, was expected to make an expedition up the Peninsula some 5 or 10 miles, for the purpose of administering the oath of allegiance to the citizens. All in Williamsburg were required to take it on the 3rd and 4th instant. He thinks the enemy's contemplated raid has been delayed by the desertion of the prisoner sent to you, and that Williamsburg is to be held by a stronger force, and become an important permanent post, held by a strong force, and become an important permanent post.

I am, major, yours respectfully,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.
