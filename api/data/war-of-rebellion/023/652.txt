until they are removed. They are now guarded by detachments of cavalry that belong at Lebanon and can be better employed.

Colonel McCOOK, Munfordville:

Dont's move present. Where is Wolford's cavalry and the rest of Fourth Michigan? Colonel Kennett is at Munfordville. See him and tell him to have the First Ohio and Fourth Michigan join their proper brigade as soon as the brigade gets to or near Munfordville, and for him to learn all he can of Morgan and be prepared to pursue him if he is not gone.

General THOMAS, Lebanon:

I have just seen your letter to Fry.* I judge from what appears in the papers that Rosecrans has been ordered to relieve me. Under the circumstances I am sure I do not grieve about it.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 30, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

For the first time since my connection with the service I feel it my duty advise as to the disposition of officers in the field. With one voice, so far as it has reached me, the army from Ohio demand the removal of General Buell.

DAVID TOD,

Governor of Ohio.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

October 30, 1862-3.40 p. m.

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

Eight days ago General Buell was superseded by General Rosecrans under order of this Department. I had been urging his removal for two months; had it done once, when it was revoked by the President. But Rosecrans is probably in command of the army in Kentucky to-day, and will retain that command if he proves worthy, as I believe he will. I am glad to find your opinion, although much later, concurs with my own.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Louisville, Ky., October 30, 1862.

Commanding U. S. Forces Louisville:
