HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 27, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

General Meade has directed that the wires be taken up. I shall picket the river, connecting with General Willcox along my whole front. I am at my old headquarters near you, and of course shall not move until you are ready, and of course can't move until we are both ready. I have sent a staff officer ahead to see if the road is clear, and I will let you know,and as soon as you are ready we can easily arrange. I shall wait for your reply and then the wires will be taken down.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 27, 1864-8 a.m.

General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: General Burnside has just come over. He has received word from General Warren that it will be at least two hours before he can get out of the way. General Burnside has therefore recalled all his orders for movement. He says he will, if you please, meet you here.

Very respectfully,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 27, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

The arrangement is quite satisfactory. I have sent an officer to look out for the road. Will see you very soon, and will not move till all is ready.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: About an hour or an hour and a half ago General Burnside and myself understood that the roads were clear, and ordered a move; but while I was starting General Burnside received a message from General Warren, at his train, saying that it would be fully two hours before his road would be cleared. I therefore halted. My road now is understood to be clear, but I am waiting for General Burnside to ascertain that his is also. The enemy show infantry pickets against us and occasionally a regiment, but I imagine no strong force, as they cannot cross the river very well. We hear nothing of our cavalry behind us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
