6. 30 a. m. I moved on the telegraph road in the direction of Fayetteville, in rear of the Second Division of this corps, making a march of sixteen miles, mostly over corduroy roads, and going into bivouac across Davis' Creek at 10 p. m.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth, Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to submit the following as a report of the movements of my division on the 12th instant: Breaking camp at 8 a. m. (this hour being necessary for the completion of the bridge being constructed by my pioneers), and crossing Big Rockfish Creek, continued on the teleghraph of old Stage road, a distance of two miles; thence to the right upon a sand road, crossing the plank road, and moving via Rockfish Factory on Little Rockfish Creek to the vicinity of Fayetteville, arriving abreast of the Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps, having moved on a road nearly parallel, at 2 p. m., placing my command in bivouac and in position forming two sides of a square, with the right more extended by the length of one brigade added, facing to the front and left.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that my division has remained in bivouac during this instant, occupying the same position as assumed yesterday. Orders regulating and organizing a division foraging party have not been enforced until to-day, owing to the fact that the mounted details of this command have been absent since the reception of the orders. The benefits to be derived from this system of foraging cannot be fully determined in my division until a practical working can be had, but I doubt not that it will be for the good of the service in many respects.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brevet Major-General.
