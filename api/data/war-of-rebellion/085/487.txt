FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 29, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City:

Do what you think best as to your guns, but the militia if organized should have all the arms you can give them to take care of the country you leave. It is indeed strange that no attention is given to your leaving, which seems to have been ordered at Washington some time since and forwarded through your former commanders.

Major-General.
