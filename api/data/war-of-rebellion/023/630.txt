Colonel ZAHM,

Commanding Cavalry, Danville:

Has Milliken's cavalry reached Danville; if so, did he get my instructions before leaving Crab Orchard? His command must go to Bardstown and watch, and try to intercept Morgan from that point and prevent his making a descent on the Lebanon Railroad.

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Captain GAUBERT, Quartermaster, Lebanon:

Order the Seventy-eighth and Ninety-first Illinois, just arrived at Lebanon, to return by forced march to New Haven, and defend that point against John Morgan's cavalry, which may be expected there to-morrow. The regiments must get to New Haven as early to-morrow as possible. The Seventeenth Indiana must defend Lebanon and the public property there, and two more regiments will march there to-morrow night. Have the wagons parked compactly. If the Seventy-eight and Ninety-first Illinois have not got to Lebanon, and you must send this order by couriers to met them and turn the regiments back to New Haven. Attend to this instantly.

General D. C. BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

John Morgan took Lexington yesterday morning (18th), and captured some of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry, report says 500 strong. General Granger's command is moving in two columns, on by the Lexington pike, and is to-night not far from Big Eagle; the other by road near railroad, and has one regiment of infantry, 300 cavalry, and a section of artillery at Paris, two regiments at Cynthiana, sand the rest at Falmouth. Both columns are being pushed forward as fast as transportation will permit, and the division you suggest will be in Lexington as soon as it can be got there. Remember they are all new troops. Bridges at Cynthiana and Paris safe. Falmouth Bridge completed by Tuesday night.

Major-General, Commanding.
