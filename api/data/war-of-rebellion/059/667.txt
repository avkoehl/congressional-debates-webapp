of clothing, with the liberality and forethought of the State of Georgia had provided for her destitute sons in the field.

General Longstreet has intrusted to me the pleasing duty of thanking you for the promptness and extent of the effort made by you in clothing and sheltering the brave Georgians in his army. The privations uncomplainingly borne by them during the last campaign, and their gallant and distinguished services throughout the war, rended them fully worthy of the grateful attention and fostering care of their noble State, which in no way more exhibits her greatest than in the bountiful manner in which she provides for her faithful soldiers.

With the assurance of the high admiration of the lieutenant-general commanding for the efficiency of the department which has been able to accomplish such results, I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
