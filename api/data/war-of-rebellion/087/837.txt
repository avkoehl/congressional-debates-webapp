New York Cavalry, asking if I needed assistance, and I requested him to send a squadron to hold the cross-roads, which he did. I continued to hold the position at Mount Sinai Church, able seconded by Major F. A. Stratton, commanding Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, until I received orders to concentrate the command and connect with the Third New York Cavalry at the cross-roads. Upon my arrival I found the Third New York had advanced, under direction of the commanding general, and followed in rear of the section of artillery to Sycamore Church. At this point Captain Speers was found with a detachment of the First District of Columbia Cavalry, who had escaped from the enemy, and had re-established their pickets on the line as much and as far as they could. The dead were found to have been stripped, and lay nearly naked where they fell. From the Sycamore Church I marched in rear of the Third New York Cavalry and section of artillery to near the Jerusalem plank road, where we arrived some time after dark. I was not called upon directly to participate in the engagement had by the Third New York Cavalry. In obedience to your orders I fell back about a mile and bivouacked.

At daylight on the morning of the 17th instant I was directed to send one company by a wood road to the right to reconnoiter to the plank road, a distance of two miles. Major Stratton detailed Captain Titus, who accomplished the reconnaissance, returning by the plank road to where he met Lieutenant-Colonel Jacobs' command occupying the ground of the engagement of the night before. Ordered on the advance on the return march, taking the neighborhood road from Gee's house to Baxter's Mills. At Gee's house a rebel scout was captured, where we arrived about 1 p.m. Captain McFarlan, Company B, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, brought in fifteen head of cattle collected by him, by order, which were turned over to Lieutenant Wilson, acting division and brigade commissary. Captain Ringland, Company A, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, with seventy-five me of Companies A, C, and G, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, were detailed, by order, at Gee's house to return by the original route for the purpose of driving in several head of cattle by the enemy in their retreat, but none were found. They had probably picked up and secreted by rebel scouts, several of whom were seen by Captain Ringland's party. One rebel officer and four men, with one citizen, charged the extreme advance of two men, accompanied by Lieutenant Nimmon, acting regimental quartermaster, Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry. They were met by Lieutenant Nimmon, aided by some men who came up from the main column, and in the skirmish the rebel officer was shot. The others escaped, leaving in our hands a private of the Third New York Cavalry, who had been taken by them. Captain Ringland charged another party of rebels at the Blackwater, but they escaped in the woods. Captain Ringland rejoined the command at Mount Sinai Church at 2 p.m. In the afternoon, after feeding, I was ordered to picket from the left of the Third New York Cavalry. I moved the headquarters Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry to Rollins' house, the detachment of the First District of Columbia Cavalry, under Captain Speers, 196 men, on their left, and I moved my headquarters to Green's house.

The report of casualties is herewith respectfully submitted.*

The loss of arms and horses cannot be directly ascertained in the First District of Columbia, as many of the company officers are captured, with the field and staff. Captain Speers will be obliged to take an account and be responsible for whatever is on hand at this date.
