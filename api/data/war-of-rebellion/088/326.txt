two prisoners captured. They report three regiments of cavalry on my front, on the Vaughan road. The First District of Columbia Cavalry will be here to-night. I have strengthened my pickets and will make a through reconnaissance at daylight, and report in person. If you could let me have one company of infantry at once I could use them at great advantage. One of the prisoners is a very intelligent, shrewd man.

Very respectfully,

S. P. SPEAR,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 20, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send you two dispatches from General Warren, one received at 1 a. m. this day, from which I hoped Warren would be able to take the offensive. This morning, not hearing from him, a call was made for information, to which was sent the dispatch* of Colonel Locke, assistant adjutant-general, now forwarded. A deserter who came in last night assets, as many have done previously, that the enemy are mining on Beauregard's front.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 20, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I forward dispatch+ just received from General Warren, from which you will see all hopes of any offensive movements on his part are at an end, and that it is now questionable whether he can establish a line with his present force from the Weldon road to the plank road. Instructions have been sent to him to employ Gregg's cavalry and the working party from City Point in destroying the railroad and not to detach any part of his infantry.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 20, 1864 - 12.50 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send two dispatches received this a. m. Your attention is called to the statement of the deserter from Finegan's brigade, which is directly in conflict with the report from General Hancock this a. m., both parties averring of their own knowledge that Wright and Perrin, of Mahone, are at the same time in front of Hancock and Warren.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
