CAMP FIRST MARYLAND BATTERY,

MCINTOSH'S BATTALION ARTILLERY,

July 8, 1864.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I respectfully ask for the proper authority to discharge certain members of my company (First Maryland Battery), whose term of service will expire on 13th of July, 1864.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. F. DEMENT,

Captain, Commanding First Maryland Battery.

HEADQUARTERS MCINTOSH'S BATTALION,
July 9, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded.

Captain Dement represents that the term of service of thirty of his men will expire on the 13th instant, and of others from that time until September; sufficient in numbers, if discharged, to break up the company. The men claim and expect to be discharged. But the act of Congress of February 7, 1864, retaining troops in service, makes no exemptions, and information is desired to know if the act applies to Marylanders.

D. G. MCINTOSH,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
