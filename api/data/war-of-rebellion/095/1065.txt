orders and arranging the troops to meet the repeated attacks of the enemy, and for their coolness and bravery during the entire movement.

At 3 p. m. April 3 I marched with my division, supplied with rations, ammunition, &amp;c., through Petersburg toward Burkeville along the line of the South side Railroad, as guard to the wagon train of the army. This division moved as far as Nottoway Court-House, which point it reached April 8, and guarded different points along the line of the railroad. No active part was taken with the enemy after April 3. I respectfully invite attention to the accompanying reports of brigade commanders.

A tabular list of casualties is appended to this report.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
