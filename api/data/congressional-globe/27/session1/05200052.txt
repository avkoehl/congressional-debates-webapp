APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1841.
§7*th Couro—1st $ess
Report of the Secretary oj Ih" Treaviry—Mr.  Woodbury.
Senate.
biience, in tint replying to s ve.al port ors i' the
speech of the Senator from Maine, mig't b< c ir -
dered a left-handed compli-nent to it-- aHhly, as
notbeing sufficient, ¡n my opinion, to ^evne notice,
and were not some of his sta'ementssin.uUrly erro-
neous. I shall, therefore, from my rote--, advert to
a few if his remarks ?s hasa'y penned do   n
In the outset, I disclaim all his  eomroenla-
tions for what fee is pics1 d to call t1 * elaborate
character of my computations, s I «•■■«• m re d -
sirous some days aao to suban' my ebj ttens th i
the Secretary's tnend appeared to h* tohuethp
report scrutin zed, prcbab'y from o <•( iv rt, n of
its numerous impel feet ons
If, as ih  Senator s'em  to «uppo <% a> } pecu'tar
anxiety was betrayed any where in res->tct to the
discussion, I am not aware tnat it exi 'ed *-rt this
side of the House
He next admits that all I read from ¡he lepo t
tending to produce an impression that the " legacy
of debt" created and left by the pan ñ dmmistra-
tion on the shoulders of the present, s equal to
forty millions, or even thirty-one milho" s has been
misunderstood by many of his political lends and
that their conclusion is entirely uifeund 1 or fabe
So be it. The Senator frrm Mame a limited ex-
pressly that he (Mr. W ) had been figh ing phan-
toms, when he had exposed tKe humbug of the
forty million debt. Is it, than, at la t liscovered
that this forty million debt of Mr. Van Burcn's ad-
ministration, which had been the theme cf every
Whig orator throughout theTJn on, wh ch * ad be°n
rung from valley to hill top, di«cu^ed at cioss
roads and t* e birs of village ale h use<—'ha> thus
is a phaniom—an igim faluus ' Ye-; il s is now i
phantom, which ha  even been asserted I y <ui non
ty as high as the Executive ch i* ot >i natno,
and ha? been circvla ed far sad wide bj m p of m
telligence, whose character in other respects won11
induce a bel ef of their con ict on of it  tfutr
The thirf}-Jne millions of excess in exp ndituie
over the rec&pts from 1837 to 1841, figured so
largely and lo sel, m this repirt, th=t JV5«■ Et ir_'s
supporters m many p aces exul e 1 ihit   had oñ -
ctally proved thp existence oi a debt to hat etten'
They even quoted h s ag regale do ¡in 'o h s«cen s,
as exemplified in one of the former extraéis, in
these words:

But niw—most gratifying re«uH,   r>    i'fae   Í
the assembled Senate, and before (he «  olt conn
try—the Senator from  Maine Irani 1) , (mils  lit
this enormous na'ional debt «as all a p' xu,   -    if
his (Mr WV) íemarks had p'O luced  rooh rk

Now, as to the fiist allegation, that T ea'ury
note ar not appropriate fiscal instruments in the
emergencies of the few past years, and have not
been prudently used by the Depprtment, I «ih
take tbe liberty to ref~, him to Mr Gallatin, a
financier no sib'y quite as high an authority ard
as long in experience in the e matters as any of ¡he
croakers wno have so flippantly assailed me on
this acccunt.
It  a« m September, 1837, that these notes
were fir<t recommended by me to be issued. It
wis during a suspension of sp cie payments
alme -,t universal, and undera temporary deficiency
of revenue, as I shall soon demonstrate.
In the pamphlet before referred to, Mr. Gallatin,
page 87, in a rote, ob erves, as to Treasary notes,
that—

So that the gent eman's reiterated charge on this
point oí not giving due noace, is refuted by the re-
cord itself But I can see how 1 e has been led into
an erroneous belief ot its correctness He has
heaid the misrepresmtation so often repeated by
others, that liks Sancho Panza's ¡mpressiQns m
that wiy, from his own repetitions of his own fa-
brication , he begins to behave the mi representa-
tion's of otncis to be *rue. Bat it he had only
turned back in his own mind, to o ber circum-
stanceb, as well as to the annual reports, he would
have found that tí ere were stu! different reasons
to account foi his mscemention, and to shew it to
b< a piliable error In al-nost every instanc,
excrpt tl e in si i sue cf notes in 1837, man) mem-
bers ci Congress b"came so ergaged i" the more
in easting employment of emb^rrassirg ihe pei-
sons n powe", and forming new combinations to
put oth-rs in their places, thai the reco"rm-nda-
tions of the President even, and much more those
of the Departments, were generally assailed by
many of teose then in «"pposiiion, and delayed
andthvaited in every posible m thod Prom
