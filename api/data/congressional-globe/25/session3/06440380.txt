two last sentences, like a lady's postscript, can-
tain the whole substance- " it would produce ex-
citement, "forsooth, to remove the defaulter, "he
has influential fhend.s," " better tel i$ be," Sir, in,
these few words you may bebokl the morality,
the poh«y, and the s*rengthof th  pai ty in powei
Like the fla¡ h language of the London swells,
they opería to those who undeistand the true
meaning, the whole secret of political rogueiy
Being interpreted, the honorable Mr Hendriek's
íettei would read " Dear Levi I am told Colbnel
Spencer is a defaulter, and you aie going to turn
him out Levi, you're a fool, you must do no
such thing, it would injure the party to turn him
out, he's a strong politician, and has got a great
deal of influence; he isn't cheating us; rt's only
the people If you know which side youi bread
is buttered, keep him in office "
And what says honest Levi to all this > Listen,
here is his answer.
Treasury Department, September 7,1836
Sir Your letter of the 31st ultimo is received, and lam
happy to inform you that Mr Spencer's explanations have
been such tlmt he will probably continue in office
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
liEVI WOODI1URY,
Secretary of the Treasury
Hon William HENDitrr-KS, Madison, Indiana
Which, being Interpieted, reads   "Deai Billy
who's a fool>  I never intended to turn him out,
I only talked about it to gull the people, and make
them think I was honest   Hcshalluc retained "
Ay, and he was retained, and soon tendered such
good service to his master as well approved the
sagacity which refused to pait with him
He has been continued in office by Mr Van
Burén,and is now receiver at Foit Wayne Theie
is one more circumstanco developed by this docu-
ment, to which I invite attention The Secretai y,
in his letter of the 23d of May to Colonel Spen
cer, tolls him, " that any neglect or inattention
to these requirements, [that is, to deposit monthly
the money on hand, and make monthly returns
theieof,] unless satisfactorily accounted foi, will
leqmre of me, fiom a sense of ufficiul duty, that
you be íeported to the Picsidcnt, with a lecom-
mendatlot) that you be, removed fiom office "
Now, in connection with this i Mract, itad the
following letter from Colonel Spencer, wntten
just upon the eve of the piesidenlial election, and
about six weeks after the coi lespondence between
Hendricks and the Secietary

JOHN ■3ITM.rR.,JlcmMr
lion Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Vi casia y
What think you of this > The lepeated injunc-
tion of the Secietary had been, that at the end of
each month he should deposit the public monev
in hand, and if he failed to do so, witkout good
excuse, he should be removed from office Well,
sir, he fails to make his deposit in October, not
by accident or necessity, but voluntanly, and
sends, m advance, his excuse to the Secietary
What is that excuse' It is that his Venina alie
friends thought that he ought not to leave until ajler
the election Jor Piesulent, in other woids, that his
duty to the partu was paramount to his official
duty, that his obligations to Mr Van Buren, (the
candidate for the Presidency,) were gieater than
his obligations to the countiy, in whose seivice
he was at least nominally employed
Accoidingly, he neglected his most important
duties for many days, that ht might use in the
election that political influence of which the lion
oiable Mr Hendncks speaks with so much unc
tion
ihe Secrctaiy receives this excuse recognizes
ts sufficiency, by not recommending hie, lemoval
from office, as he had piomised to do, in case the
Eublic ®ejmlteri~*-Mr. Prentiss.
reason should Mot be satisfactory, and has thus
convicted himself of entertaining and piacticing
the piofligatedocinne that mteiference m (lec-
tions by an office-holder is not only justifiable,
but involves Ogh ghet dcgice of obligation than
the mere perfoi (stance of official duty It was not
meiely to exeicise his elective franchise as a cit-
izen thnt Speftoei violated the induction of the
Department, this right he could Iwe exercised
where hit? duty called him, as" well as at Tort
Wayne But that would not do, he had influence
at the latter place, which it was important to the
party he should exeicise, Having thus violated
ins solemn official obligations, foi the puipose of
assisting Mi Van Buren into the presidential
chair, it was of course-no more than fair that the
President should íeturn the favor He did return
it He continued Cclonel Spencer in office, and
thus, at the same time, exhibited his gratitude,
violated his duty, and prostituted his high station
This, Mr Chairman, is but a specimen of that
corrupt reciprocity of service which constitutes
the ligature that binds together, like the Siamese
twins, the Executive and the office-holders
Sir, the document fiom which I have made the
foregoing extracts is a public record, and was
furnished to the Senate at the time when Mr Van
Buten was President of that body Of couise, he
cannot plead ignorance of its contents Yet, in
the face of the lepoitof West, of the profligate
letter of Hendncks, of the shameless avowal of
the receiver himself, that he neglected the paia-
mount duties of his office for the purpose of ex
erasing his influence at the election—in face of all
tins, the Piesident mgleets and u fuses to apply
the power of removal and the unblushing paiti-
san still rem tins in office, ready, doubtless, at the
next election, to play again the game which proved
so profitable at the last
I will no longer detain the committee with this
disgiaceful case^ but, leaving it and the parties
conceined to the judgment of the country, pioceed
to the consideration of another I will take the
case of Han ii, receiver ot the land office at Co-
lumbus, in my own State In this instance I
expect to convict the Secretary of the Tieasuij ,
not of a single isolated neglect of duly, but a con
tinued, daily, miserable winking and connivance
at mnlveisation and defalcation, tinting a period
of two yenis, implicating alike his honesty, his
veincity, and his capacity First, however, I
will show what importance the Treasury Depart-
ment attached to the duty incumbent upon col-
lectors and receivers, of depositing in bank, at
stated peuods, the public moneys in then hapds,
because it was from the continued violation of
this duty that the defalcation in the case of Ha rus
as well as in most others, occurred, anil because
it will leave the Secretary no excuse, from the
supposed insignificance of the duty, for the gross
and culpable negligence on his own pait, which
makes him, in justice and truth, a paiticeps enm-
nu? in the whole affair
I  hold in my hand a book of some fourhundied
pages, entitled " Letteisfiom theSccietaiy of the
Iieasuiy, transmitting copies of letteis to col
lectois and recavéis who have failed to comply
with the laws and legulations foi their govern
rnent, and also copies of tepoits of examinations
of land offices since 1st Januaiy, 1834," &c It
is Document 297, anil was furnished the House
by the Secietary on the 30th of Maich, 1838 It
is the most extiaoidinai y publication that evei fell
under my observation It is a moral, political,
and liteiaiy cuuosity
II  you aie a laughing philosopher, you will find
I in it ample food for ninth, if you belong to the
othei  school, you cannot but weep at the folly
j and imbecility which it exhibits The Secretary
must have been fngluened when he compiled it,
foi it is without form, and daikness lests upon

tlie duty of depositing the public moneys in bank,
at statta periods, so that they might not ascjmu-
late in the hands, of the collector, and thus a'Tord
temptation to defalcation
The. first letter I shall quote wa% fioti Mr,
Taney, then Secretary of theTieasui y It is No
1 of the ¡etteis to leceiveis, is dated January 16,
1834, directed to B. B, Steiling, ieceiver of pub-
lic moneys, and concludes as follows
' I will only fiuther idd thit the obligations to deposit
ike pul he monej promptly, and to renuer your returns and
accounts punctually, ire impcialice and must in future be
regarded as paramount to all other duties "
Again, under date of 18th of May, 1834, Mr
Taney wntes to J W. Dickson, receiver at Mount
Salus, Mississippi:
" Certificates of deposit arc to be addressed to t us office^
these, and the prompt and punctual de¡ osit of the public
money, are to be regarded as paramount duties, the strict
perfoi manee of which will be insisted on "
On the 18th of July, 1834, Levi Woodbury
writes the following ciicular to some seven or
eight leceiveis.
" I re¿ret to be under the necessity of noticing your omis-
sions to make returns tor the months of April, May, and
June la&t By a circular, dated the 15th of Ja mary last,
you were advised of the necessity of promptitude in this re-
sp< ct It rem tins thit I should aiam remind you, once for
ally lhat tins w fit duty u-hich must be punctually observed "
In a letter to the receiver at Augusta, Missis-
sippi, dated August 4, 1834, he says-
" Upon the subject of the request made in your letter of
the 6th instant 1 have to observe that tile Department ccn-
noi relax in tlie i emulations preset ibedfor ihe periodical de-
postfS of the pul he inoney "
On the 30tn January, 1835, he writes to the
receiver at Helena.
" 1 he Department having received no duplicate of the
monthly returns rcquuid by its legulations, showing the
transactions of your office, suae your ippouitnent, it be-
comts proper to call jour immedi tteattention to tins duty,
inil t) intoriu you tb u puiu tuality m this re pect, and in
the drpo ü of the pulUcmoney, are to be regaided as para
mouní duties, and will be insisted on accoiiUngly "
,     To I inn, receiver at Vandilia, he says, Peb-
1 ruaiy 12, 1835
j " Once for ill then, I will inform 50U that 1 strict ob-
serv nice ol the icgulati ins of the Department for the pcrt-
0 ileal deposit of the public money, anil the transmission of
youi accounts an 1 m turns, aye paramount duties, the nog
lect 01 winch will be íeported for the action of the Exec-
utive "
To the ieceiver at Demopohs, he writes, Feb-
ruary 20, 183>
" I embrace the occasion to say to you, once for all, that
punctuality in making your returns, and deposit of the pub
lie moneys are to be regarded as pararnount duties, tha
neglect of which will be reported for the action of the Ex-
ecutive "
Again, February 28,1835, in acircularto some
fifteen receiveis
" I cannot omit the occasion to impress upon j ou the ne-
cessity of 1 strict attention to, and punctual compliance
with, the duties required of you in regard to the prompt
deponl of the pullic money, and transmission of your re
turns , ai d to * ly to jou ih it the performance of those du-
nes must be regirded as paramount to all others myour
official statun "
Again, July 30, 1835, the Secretary writes to
the ieceiver at Helena
" 1 he regular deposit if tae whole of the public moneys,
as pieseriti d bv tin regulations of the Tieasury, and the
punctual ti insiu sion of joui accounts and monthly re-
turns   ARF P 1FAU(1U\T OFFICIAL DIHIFS "
I give these extracts fiom the letters and circu-
láis of tlie Secietaty to show that the periodical
deposit of the puMic money wasaparomoKniiZuiy
of the collectois and leceiveis
If, then, 1 show that the Secretary neglected to
enforce the perfoi manee 01 punish the neglect of
this pai amount duty,it may be fairly infel red that
he is eithet unwilling or incompetent to enforce,
in his subordinates, the performance of any duty
