TULLAHOMA, August 10, 1862.

General THOMAS:

Just received General Nelson's dispatch. I shall send two companies of cavalry to-night to Hubbard's Cove. Some movement is evidently intended against some part of our lines, as all the light parties of the enemy have suddenly disappeared.

JAMES D. MORGAN,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 10, 1862.

Colonel STARKWEATHER,

Mooresville:

Start your column so that it shall reach the place appointed by 6 o'clock this evening. The three columns will encamp together to-night under the senior officer unless they should return.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 10, 1862.

Captain WALKER,

Provost-Marshal, Athens:

Allow the introduction and sale of goods not contraband in small quantities and for the usual demand of the town and neighborhood.

No good to be sold to cross the Tennessee River. No goods are to be sold or introduced without permission. No permission to introduce or sell will be granted to notoriously disloyal and hostile persons.

D. C. BUELL.

COLUMBIA, August 10, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

The Third Kentucky Cavalry were ordered here to act in concert with Kennett's cavalry. The guerrilla parties who are committing these depredations rendezvous west of this, in Hickman and Lawrence; are increasing in numbers. Can only be accomplished by surprise, which I will certainly effect if permitted use of the cavalry. According to my familiarity with the country to send poorly mounted cavalry along the public roads will never succeed unless by mere accident.

JAS. S. NEGLEY.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 10, 1862.

Major-General THOMAS,

Decherd:

Written orders were sent you two days ago to send guard of 40 men on each train to Murfreesborough, each guard to return on next train from Murfreesborough to guard it far as Decherd.

J. M. WRIGHT.
