Major-General MEADE,

Gum Springs, via Centreville:

Captain [William] Jay's dispatch received. Slocum is ordered up to Leesburg at 3. 30 a. m. The enemy's cavalry are at Point of Rocks, smashing trains. Stuart may be here as the advance of Lee's army, or to cover the recrossing of his raiders, or vice versa. At any rate, we are ready for them. No further moves will be ordered until the enemy develops his intention or force. You will, of course, support Pleasonton, if he should require it. Please inform Howard of Slocum's movement. If anything should occur that Slocum would need him, he must move up. Post Pleasonton, and send him the following, left out of copy of Slocum's order, sent to Pleasonton by his orderly: Hold Leesburg, and open communication with fords on Potomac in that vicinity, and hold them.
