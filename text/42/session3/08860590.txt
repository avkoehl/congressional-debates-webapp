Mr. HAMLIN. I have also a memorial
from the Legislature of the Territory of
Dakota, in which they represent that no grant
for the construction of railroads has ever been
made in that Territory south of the forty-sixth
parallel, which is I believe within that portion
of Dakota contemplated to be erected into a
Territory by the name of Pembina; and in
view of that fact they ask urgently that some-
thing may be done to advance the interests and
develop the resources of the remaining por-
tions of the Territory. I move that, without
reading, the memorial be referred to the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, and that it be printed.
