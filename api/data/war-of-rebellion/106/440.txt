Preamble and resolutions adopted by the American citizens of San Juan Island, Wash. Ter., at a meeting held on the 1st day of February, A. D. 1863, at the suggestion of Captain Bissell, commanding U. S. forces at Camp Pickett, for the purpose of making laws by which they would be governed.

Whereas, under the organic act of the Congress of the United States for the establishment of the Territorial government of Washington, the first Legislative Assembly in 1854 passed on act including the island of San Juan as a part of Whatcom County; and

Whereas, that act was duly submitted to Congress and has not been dissapproved of, we therefore cannot but regard it as the laws of the land; and

Whereas, we wish to be known as loyal citizens of the United States, avoiding even the semblance of secession: Therefore,

Be it resolved: First. That we will be governed by the laws provided us by the Legislative Assembly of Washington Territory and the United States, and that we will at all times cheerfully recognize the lawfully constituted authorities of the Territory, and when necessary aid them in the discharge of their duties.

Second. That we cannoptain Bissell in thinking that he is our Governor, or that he has the power to authorize us to make laws by which we will be governed, it being evident to us that, according to the arrangement made by General Scott and His Excellency Governor Douglas, the military were placed here to exercise a police supervision over the citizens and subjects of their respective Governments, and to aid the civil authorities of these Governments in enforcing the laws upon their respective subjects and citizens, or in protecting them in their lives, property, and all the rights to which they are entitled.

Third. That any citizen of the United States who has or may preempt a land claim on this island, and perform act upon it that show occupancy in good faith, should be protected by us in his rights if interfered with during his absence.

Fourth. That a copy of the proceedings of this meeting be sent to the Governor of our Territory, to General Wright, Captain Bissell, and to the editor of the Washington Standard.

President.
