25th Cong •••2nd Se$ .
Independent Treasury—Mr. Kennedy.
Senate-
in regard to this subject, is as various as the habits, manners,
and modes of th.nkwg of the different States One State, with
a small population but great capability, Mississippi for exam-
ple, authorises the creation of banking capital 10 the amount
of fifty millions, and applies herself eagerly to the task of giv-
ing expansion to her industry in every shape in which she can
employ it. Another State, Virginia, with troble the population
of the former, and perhaps with resources equally abundant,
erects a banking system which scarcely employs seven millions
It may be the wisdom or the caprice, the false reckoning or
sober estimate of each of these states which has persuaded
them to adopt a policy so widely different from each otaer
Mississippi may nave overshot her mark, or Virginia may have
too tn.idly kept herself below her power, still each has acted
upon her own perception of her interest, and, it is obvious,
without the slightest reference to the other And so it is, sir,
throughout the Union A survey of the whole will showyou
the banking system of the States erected and sustained alto-
gether upon local considerations, presenting every conceivable
inequality m its operation In one portion, distrust, caution,
and doubt fettering the industry of the State, in another, emu-
lation, adventure, and hope, tinging rs enterprise with sanguine
hues, and leading, it may be, sometimes, to extravagant excess
These several jurisdictions ar<* no moie capable of producing
uniformity in banking, even if they were inclined to do so, than
in any other matter of general concern to the Union As well
iright you expect the States, sir, by their fortuitous concur-
rence, to produce a uniform law of naturalization, the uniform
organization of the militia, or an equal and properly appor
tinned representation in this hall, as to expect of them harmony
and concert in their regulation of the affairs or trade through
the agency of their bank* Let capital abound in one region,
and the demand for it be ever so urgent m another, what State
bank would be found tiansferring its funds to meet a temporary
emergency growing out of such a causel The States will ne*
cessanly be influenced only by the considerations which arise
at home, and have reference to their domestic interests The
want of uniformity m ght be harmless if there was not also in
cident to thissystem, when left to follow lis own impulses un
checked, not only a want of co operation with other States, but
often actual interference with them and couuter actions in their
several concerns Instead of moving under the consiramts of
a general system, their mam impulse will be found in the prm
ciple of competition.
This competition will be ma nfest m the legislation of State
against State, it will extend itself, and predominate in the con
test between city and city, and still moie actively on the nar
lower dieatrc at nome, m the rivalry betweei bank and hank
Thegieatinstmctofthispimeiple of competition is a hurtful
one its tendency is towaids excess Two bdnks m the saine
village wiH run the race against each other Each will stuve
to supply tne neighborhood with the greater facilities, to lend
upon more attainable securities, to embrace a larger clast, of
dealers, to luí e adventure, as means abound, by sttll greater en-
ticements If a large circulation may be absorbed to day, a
still larger one, in the reckoning o( these rivals in the race, may
b° absorbed to morrow—the larger the cuculation the greater
the profit. The feverish cupidity of avarice will perceive m
sue * a course the road to large gams, and, whilst the banks pur
sue it, the last thought which will occur to the authors of these
efforts will be the consequences of this excited action upon the
g neial welfare oí the nation Such, sir, are he tend nciesofthe
uicon ro'Ied principle of competition in banking
The action of a central power restrains and corrects these
tendencies A National Bank, under an efficient organization,
has, if not an absolute, certainly a moot d«cissive control over
thevalueandamountofthe local currencies aupolied by the
State banks To say nothing of that mostimpertdntactionof a
National Bank upon the exchanges—by far the mo*t useful of
its functions—3uch an institution regulates the local currency
mrouga another influence of great value to the stability of the
banking system A bank sustained by the credit of the Go
vernment, and strengthened b) the deposites of the public
moneys, cannot but enjey the umveral confidence of the na-
tion Its paper will necessarily be esteemed as of the beat, and
will be current m every avenue of business Such a paper, sir,
becomes a gauge by which to measure the value oí all other
paper for which it may be exchanged In that respect it holds
toward  other paper somewhat of the relation which the pre-
cious metals hold to íuelf I know, sir, that it is a received
and familiar proposition that a better currency will not circu-
late in the presence of an inferior one This is true of coin it w
set true of paper Com will net circulate m the presence ef a
depieciated paper, because it may immediately betake itself to
foreign countries, where it will command us value, or it may re
tire into private hoards, tobe kept until a better state of things
shall draw it firth into circulation But when a bank is able to
put forth an unquestionable paper, all of inferior value will dis
appear before it. The public will prefer that paper which en
lays the highest credit, and tbey will lefuse all other whilst
that is attainable It is the interest and business of such a
bank to render its paper at all times attainable, its profit con-
sists in supplying the public wit1* a circulation which can
neither lie hoarded nor sent abroad This paper, in (act, circu-
lates upon its superior credit, and thus enerossesto itself, as far
as its own volume will permit, the husmees of the community
It is sir, hy the influence of thte principle that the paper of a
National Bank, fortified by the credit and «sources of the Go
vernment, become-? a regulator of the value of all of all other
cur-eno m 'he nation it furnishes the gauge or standard to
which alt local paper, in its own district or appropriate range,
must conform In this aspect, the ren'ral banking powei may
be and to constitute a great Conservative element in the ad
iu traentand preservation oí a sound cunency
It 10, Mr Chairman, m the just bal nice of those two prin-
ciples of centralization ami competition that the greatest em
ciency and safety are given to our system The central power
alone might not be suffic«i«tly observant "and regardful
of local wants, m the greater prohtsof the more important ope
ra.ion  of exchange, it might lose sight of sectional convenience,
and of the wants of the lesser circles of trade the local banks
will Ply within these limits, greatly to the advantage of them
selves and of the public On the other hand, the local banks
alone, for the reasons I have given, would found utterly inca
pable of fulfilling the broader functions>ssigned to the central
^The necessity for this division results, in part, from the na
ture of our confederacy The Federal power is essential to the
control of all interests which expand beyond the limits of a sin
ele State, whilst the State power is well entrusted with the mu
nieipat regulation  necessary toils own well bei gn   The uwu
tution of banking, having a great and predominating influence
ovet the currency of the country, rises in «moderation far
above a mere municipal concern, into one of the bioadest na
tional importance, and nothing ha  been found more authenti
cally established in i he experience of this Government, than the
absolute necessity o{ imparting to the management of the banks
a certain share of Federal supervision
Mr Chairman, I charge it ujwn the late Administration, as
one step taken by them towards the embarrassment of this na-
tion, that they rashly and most unwisely deprived the country
ef the benefit of this Federal supervision over theeurreney, by
the destruction of the late Bank of the United States    Sir, that
Administration did not very maturely reflect upon the conse
quences of the destruction of the bank    They sinned against
light, for it is evident that they recognised, to the fullest extent,
the value and the indispensable necessity of this principle of
centralization upon which I have remarked    Their whole
course, m the e^rly stages of that pernicious movement which
has brought upon ue our present disasters, attests their ac-
knowledgment of the necessity of the Federal control through a
central power in banking When General Jackson first resolved
upon the downfall of the Bank; it was not to destroy the ma
ehinery of a national institution, it was only to build up another,
as he believed, of a more efficient structure    His first messages
reiterate, again and again, the necessity, thd great utility and
importance of a National Bank    The war against the bank was
a war of individual hate, its object was individual punishment
The pretext was an objection to the form of organization only—
a que&tion of detail to be corrected in a new establishment 1 he
Executive, at that time, so far from repelling the necessity of the
principle of this Bank, engaged m the struggle to give tnat pnn
ciple more scope and effect    And even alter wards, t-ir, when
this sti ife between I eviathan and Behemoth ceased to be a con
tention of argument, and became one of passion, and when tht
victorious chief had turned all his malice to its threat account,
and sti uck down hi** adversary, even then, sir, the principle was
sail avowedand piomulgated that, without a cential puwer, the
currency could not be sustained    That central power was at-
tempted to be fashioned on a new model, but out of old mate,
rials    Tt was the chief and most conspicuous design, in the
celebrated experiment, to manufacture a great central or na'ion
al control over the currency, out of some thirty or forty State
banks, which weie to h* affiliated by a Government contract,
and clothed with all the Federal powers>heretofore conferred up-
on the Bank of the United States    In fact, it was designed by
this form of association to erecta Bank of the United States,
with all the function of alliance and centralization oí winch the
a^socntion  was capable     And, sir, it was proclaimed to be
capable of this function to as beneficial an extent as the Bank
whose term was just drawing to a ch -e    It is not my purpose,
Mi  Chm man to occupy the lime of the committee with a dis
cussionof the value of this scheme of General lack eon and his
cabinet, but liefer to it to show tha , even up to the moment of
t le failure of the great experiment, unbracing much the longer
portion of the existence of that Administration, the pauv m Mie
ascendant were as full} imbued as I am at this momert with the
coiviction of the i nportance of this caitwl bankine povn
which tt is now, m certain quarters, the habit of some of trie
same party and of tne «ame men to portray in so many shapes
of ahhonenceand drcust
It was the dot) of the President, before he entered upon the
latn enterprise of pul ling down tne Hank of the United btates,
to be well assured t'mt be could supply other machinery capa
ble of performing the functions and rendering the services winch
the destruction of that inMitutien might suspend It was his
boast that this new contrivance of the associated State banks
would amply till the space, and even more faithfully discharge
the duties of tne retiring Bank than that Bank itself had ever
done I need not recall the glowing premises of success which
the Administration poured forth with such lavish exultation
upon the birth of tneir experiment nor, sir, is it necessary
to dwell for a moment upon the signal failure of that fa
motis abortion, the fiist are wntten m eveiy line of <ffiuial
communication which the sell complacent spirit of the Presi
dent addressed m a thousand forms, to the country, upon the
auspicious event the last has been baptized in the tear*, of the
nation Sir, I have a right, therefore, to charge the last Admi
niotration, and its present followers, with all the consequences
which have flowed from this misjudged and ill fated measure
In following up the train of events that sprang Irom this
movement of the cabinet oí General Jackson, the next sien was,
if possible, eien more misihievous ihan the first It will be
seen, sir, in the course adopted in the employment of the State
banks One would have supposed, Mr Chairman, that a
statesman, entering upon bo fearlul and momentous an expert
ment as that of 1833, would proceed at least warily and with
some cautions íeserve m the untried and perilous career before
him, that he would reflect upm the novelty of hi- position,
wei^h us dangeis, and, in shaping his course, rather incur the
riskofbeinff chid for too much discretion than taxed for h-s
boldness Far other than this was the characteristic of the ad
vanee uf the late President to the difficulties of the crisis When
the public moneys Wi re removed into the keeping oí the chosen
banks, instead of admonitions of prudence in the u e of the pub
lie funds, instead of restriction or constraint, the Administration
made haste to order that these treasures should be «cattercd
far and wide with a profuse indulgence The depositories were
enjoined to take care that no facility be denied to commerce,
but that the moneys on deposite be distributed as broadly and
as liberally as the public (onvemence, the demands of trade,
might require Instead, sir, ofadvising the banks that now, the
great regulating and controlling power being withdrawn, it be
came more urgently their duty to sruaid against that licentious
i sue which the uncurbed principie of competition must en
p-ender, they were exhorted and commanded to let loose the
fullest play of that rivalry, and drive their headlong course as
swiftly as their appetite for cam might prompt "The Presi
dent, sir, was not leftunadmontshedofthe inevitable end of this
mistaken policy Here, m this Hall, and in the Senate, he was
told to what result this madness must impel the nation From
all quarters the same prophetic warning was poured into his
ear, and all thinking men, every where but m the Executive
mansion, foresaw the certain disaster that awaited the expe
nment                           ,                                   .     ,    ,
Sir, at this time another element concurred to tender the ex-
periment more mischievous Tne President's veto had an-
nounced to the nation the entire hopelessness of obtaining a je
newal of the charter ef the National Bank Upon that subject
he was peremptory and emphatic, and the States, being thus
assured that the bank was to expira, were invited to increase
their banking capital     At once, as by a common impulse,
every State iri the Union set about enlarging ivs means of bank-
ing    The pretext was the necessity of supplying the vacuum
«f capital to be occasioned by the extinction ot the National
Bank    Under this pretext, nearly four hundred bank* an! on*
hundred and ten millions of capital were created between IBSi.
and 1838, whilst at the same time, that bank whose extinction
furnished the plea for this increase was not withdrawn, nor was
its activity m business even diminished, but on the contrary,
yethves and thrives m the full possession ot its capital, and is
likely long to live and thrive    The activity imparted by these
measures to the banking system of the country soon began to
be felt in Western speculations m the public lands, ana it be-
came apparent, atan early day, that the public treasure would
be greatly augmented through this channel    Sir, in view of
such a result, and with a learned forecast of the disturbance
the event was likely to produce, the wisest man amongst the
c itmsellors of this nation, the most effective and truoty of her
statesmen, broughtbefore Congress thatgreat measure, the bill
for regulating the distribution of the public lands    By a fata
Iity which signalized the career of the late Administration, and
invariably impelled it—whenever there was a choice between
risht and wrong—into the wrong path, the President thougnt
pioper to put his veto on this nieas.uref and thus convert the
whole proceeds of tl e sale of the public domain, which pro-
perly belonged to the capital of the nation, into the ordinary
revenuesof the Government—e\en'u lly producing some forty
millions of purple, which, in its course of pioduction, was
fed by, and contnbu ed to feed, the local banks, and to turn all
the currents of ordinary commerce awry    Instead of restrain-
ing the accumulation uf revenue, whuli pruuence would have
suggested as essential under the new system of deposite, *he
Pres dent took «very step in his power to augment it, and to
distribute it m the most unwholsome manner his opportunity
allowed   it was ciccomphsmng the worst po&oibte  purpose, in
the worst possible way, an 1 extracting; the greatest amount of
mischief out of the most mischievous thing he could devise, I,
theiefore, again Jay it to the account of that Administ) anon, as
in part the cause of the present embarrassments, that it built
up that dispioportioned and ungoverned system of Statebai k
nig which has been found so mjunous and nurtured that syi
tem hy the unhealthy and unnatural stimulos of ex cesa ve
treasure unwiselj accumulated in the manner I have descubes
First, it was promulgated; alter Mr Gouge, and almost m
the terms of his book, that it was essential the specie bas s
should be widened bvexcluding ftomemi'- ion all b n'u otes
under the denomination of one hundred uonars, or at Ue^t of
fifty    This no'ion  was embodied m the  Treasury cniuacts
wiih the banks, and finally m the cunency bill of 183C? it was
to be carried out by degrees beginning wifh the excision ef
fives, then of tons, and so onward to the ultimas teim    I will
not stop, Mr í hairman, to u quire into ir-a pohev t f this mea-

We were creating debt abroad    Theactni'y of «vrula inn,
to which I ¿are already alluded, had enlarged the of mand of
the country for commodities of lorei0n product.on as v "'1 as ol
domestic      Prices   were on   the increase      Such   in brief,
sir,  was the state   of  things   at home     A prudent  Go
vernment   would  have   feared  a foreign   debt,   aril   ts&vn
■iome  cautions   against its  increase      Not  so,  Mr   Chair-
man, with ours    It was proclaimed as the great ammtion of
the Prtsiuent, his paramount w«h, that the precious metals
should be made to abound    New mints were provided for    In
the language of a conspicuous Senator, famous in the rnnals
of this movement it was prophesied that "gold was to hwim
up the Mississippi in a never failing stream *'    The agent of
the depoMte hanks,asoceitam serri official functicnaiy fReu
benM Whitnej] was then called, had orders to communicate
to the whole circle  of denositones within his charge, that it
would be agreeable to die President to learn they concui red with
him in the propriety and importance oí making large impoita*
tionsof specie from abroad  The hint, sir, was not lost  It^was
not the temper of the deposite banks to frustrate even the whim
of the President m those days, and so thpy ail «et about the work
of importation    In the meantime, the Piesidenthtmself turned
importer of specie, and the indemnities weie ordered home «it
great sacrifice, mgold     Individual merchants weie piomp^ed,
through the same influence", t  engage in the same operation
It is a little remarkable, in the change of times, that those who
now quarrel with a State bank for purchasing cotton to pay
a foreign debt, should then have seen no harm m forty bankt, or
more turning merchants, and importing gold and silvei íocj eatf
such a debt    The amount brought mro the country from Eu
rope, in the year 1835 6, has been fstimatcd above forty mil
lions of dollars—more than thmy of which came from England
How much was imported Irom South Amer ca and other torcían
countries we have  no  means of knowing,   undoubtedly the
amount was considerable    Sir, with the exception of the n
demnmes, nearly the whole of this vast amount of com was
brought into this country at ihe expense of a debt to the same
amount to the people fiom wtiam it was obtained    It swelled
the already accumulating balance against us    It was brought
here m forced counteraction of the laws of trade—aeams the
principle which regulates supply and demand—in absolute líos
tility to the mte ests of our commeice    At the very time fhat
it came here we should have been letrenehmg expenditure and
lessening the foreign debt, instead of increasing it    Our cur
rency did not require this aid    We had in the country even
more specie than, m pa-*t times, hail been found necessary to the
safest condition of our paper i<u=ue      As me balance of trade,
or the state of foreign indebtedness   which would have le
quired remit'ances to England, was against us, so also, sir, as
between the Atlantic States and the West, the balance wasj in
like manner, agair st the Wes^ and the course of trade required
remittances of specie from the West to the Atlantis    In fact,
the whole tendency of exchange-*, from the remotest western
border, was eastward, evfcn until they croseed the ocean     In
this juncture the Pre&idem wt«. not only so absurJ as to direct
