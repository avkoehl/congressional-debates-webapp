Lieutenant Colonel G. M. SORREL,

Asst. Adjt. General Longstreet's Corps, Army of Tennessee:

The Secretary of War has directed General Cobb at Atlanta to obtain and forward horses for Alexander's battalion within the shortest possible delay. The authorities still object to sending horses from here.

LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN, September 29, 1863.

Captain MANNING:

The enemy are busily engaged this a. m. in strengthening Fort Cheatham and enlarging a heavy earth-work on their left flank. Last night their fires were fewer than usual on this and more numerous on the other side of the river from the toe of the Moccasin to the lower bridge. They also planted a battery of field pieces opposite the tan-yard last night.

DUVALL,

Lieutenant.

RICHMOND, VA., September 30, 1863.

General B. BRAGG,

Headquarters, near Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Your dispatch to Adjutant-General about Generals Polk and Hindman has been submitted to me.* Your letter borne by Colonel Beard has been received. From the statement of the case, I think it was unfortunate that the evil resulting from delay had not been pointed out to the lieutenant-general to prevent its recurrence, and confidence preserved by abstaining from further action. It is now believed that the order in his case should be countermanded.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
