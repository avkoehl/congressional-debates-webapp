anxious about the location of these gun boats today, on account of the nervous condition of the guard on Coggins' Point [[Pennsylvania Reserves]. The boats may return tonight. Their absence may be noted, and until we get artillery located, the command at Coggins' Point will not feel safe. Five hundred regular troops under Captain J. D. Wilkins will be there tonight, and so far as their strength will suffice fear nothing; but I would like the cooperation of the gun boats, and for them to lie somewhat fixed in their position, as thesy tend to keep the enemy from a raid. The commanding officer [Colonel Sickel] at Corrings' reported this morning the appearance of cavalry in his front; supposed to be about three companies, but there was no definite information, and I have sent to asvertain the real state of affairs there. He wihtdrew his pickets a long distance. The road asvending the hill is not finished for artillery. In absence of Colonel Averell

[I believe with you] I have called upon Colonel Childs, Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, for two companies of his regiment

[previously indicated by him as the one to go over there], and they will cross at 3 o' clock. I design these merely to furnish small pickets until others cross and all get into position. I propose the following at Coggins' Point: To send over one battery [12 - pounders] today so soon as the road is ready, which will be in half an hour [about 2, 30], and tomorrow another battery

[horse artillery]. Tomorrow I send a brigade of at least 1, 500 men under General Butterfield to stay two days, to be relieved by one of Sykes', and so on throught the corps. As soon as they can be obtained the cavalry will go over, and reconnoitering parties employed. At Cole's Landing I have 200 men. They have been directed [to complete], and I presume by this time have completed the rifle - pits. No gun boats protect. I presume by this time the lower battery, under General Barry's direction, is prepared to lend its aid.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. J. PORTER,

Major - General, Commanding.
