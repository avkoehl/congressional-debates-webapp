Reports of Asst. Surg. Charles Smart, U. S. Army, Medical Inspector, of operations March 1-April 30.

HDQRS. SECOND ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 31, 1865.

COLONEL:

The battle and movement that took place toward the termination of this month prevented me from holding the customary inspection of regimental camps and from rendering my report according to the prescribed form.

During the greater part of the month of March the corps lay in camp in rear of the line of works stretching from Fort Cummings to Hatcher's Run at the Vaughan crossing. As the nature of this ground and formation of camps are specified particularly in my report for last month, I will here indicate only the measures taken in order to effect improvements in the condition of those commands mentioned as having been unhealthily situated.

The camping ground of the Second Brigade, Second Division, the swamp bordering the run at the Vaughan road, was considerably altered for the better, although the difficulties in the way of draining were very great, on account of the basin-like formation of the surface. Free trenching and active police, however, did very much.

In the case of the camp occupied by the Eight New York Heavy Artillery it was found impossible to effect any satisfactory alternation, and hence a removal form the location became necessary. Permission to this end was readily obtained from the major-general commanding, and the camp was removed some distance to the rear of its original position. In settling anew this regiment built log huts of the usual style, but the other regiments in the brigade continued to occupy the company barracks or shelter-tent covered stockades referred to in my last report.

The number of sick treated by the officers of the corps is expressed below:
