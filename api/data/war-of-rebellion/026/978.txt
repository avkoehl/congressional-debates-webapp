which is honor has been informed may be expected during the coming night. In addition to the force Brigadier-General Winder has placed at his Excellency's command, Major-General Elzey has been requested to bring into the city two of his battalions. To this request the major-general from Chaffin's Bluff has promptly replied:

The two battalions asked for have been ordered to hold themselves in readiness under arms; but it would be well for His Excellency (the Governor) to apply to the Secretary of War in the mean time for the force under my command. I am inspecting, but will be in the city by sundown.

Accordingly, by direction of His Excellency, I have the honor to ask that the order suggested by General Elzey may be given.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. BASSETT FRENCH,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

[General HILL:]

GENERAL: My wagons train will be here from Pungo at 7 p. m., the quartermaster writes me who is in charge of it. Captain Reilly opened on the enemy this morning, but can produce but little effect, except to make him keep close. They returned his fire with four 32-pounders. I trust to God all is going well with you. Let me know what I shall do. My quartermaster at Tranter's Bridge has forage for some four days, after which he says he knows not where to procure it. No recent news from Bath.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
