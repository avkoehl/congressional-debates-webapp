Captain ROBERT T. DUNHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: You will please proceed to perform the following duty:

You will take the first steamer bound up the Mississippi River, and communicate as soon as practicable with Rear-Admiral Porter, U. s. Navy, commanding Mississippi Squadron, and with Major General U. S. Grant, commanding the Department of the Tennessee.

To the former, you will represent the solicitude which I experience in view of the partially defenseless condition of the Lower Mississippi, which has not an iron-clad boat between New Orleans and the sea, nor a light-draught gunboat, either iron-clad or tin-clad, to patrol or to cooperate with the land forces in any expedition which the army may be required to set on foot.
