, The bill accordingly received its several read-
ings, and was passed.
COURT OF CLAIMS ADVERSE REPORTS.
Mr. MAYNARD. I wish just at this point to
move to reconsider the vote by which an adverse
report of the Court of Claims was yesterday re-
fered to the Committee of the Whole House on the
Private Calendar, for the purpose of having it re-
ferred to the Committee of Claims.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will say to the
gentleman from Teneessee, that the law requires
that adverse reports from the Court of Claims
• shall go to the Committee of the Whole House
on the Private Calendar.
Mr. MAYNARD. X move, then, that the Com-
mittee of the Whole be discharged from the fur-
ther consideration of the case, in order that it may
Mb referred to the Committee of Claims.
The SPEAKER. The law requires that ad-
verse reports of the Court of Claims shall be sent
to the Committee of the Whole House on the
Private Calendar. They go there without a vote
upon the part of the House. The Chair is of the
opinion that the committee can only be discharged
through the channel of the committee itself.
Mr. MAYNARD. Has not the House con-
trol of it ?
The SPEAKER. It is not before the House
in such a shape that it can be reached.
ST. PAUL AND LAKE SUPERIOR MAIL ROUTE.
Mr. WASHBURNJE, of Illinois. I ask the
unanimous consent of the House to introduce a
bill to establish the St. Paul and Lake Superior
overland mail route to the Pacific.
Mr. HUGHES. I object.
WATER FOR THE DISTRICT.
Mr. BOWIE. I ask the consent of the House
to introduce a bill, the object of which is to give
certain powers to the corporations of Washing-
ton and Georgetown, for supplying the said cities
with water from the Washington aqueduct.
Objection was made.
Mr. BOWIE. Then I give notice that I shall
introduce the bill as soon as an opportunity pre-
sents itself.
CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC BILL.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. I now insist on
my motion that the rules be suspended, and that
the House resolve itself into the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union; and ask the vote
first on my motion to close debate upon the con-
sular and diplomatic appropriation bill in one
hour after its" consideration shall be resumed in
committee.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. PHELPS, of~Missouri. I now ask for a
vote upon my other motion.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended, and the House
resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, (Mr. Stevenson in the
chair,) and resumed the consideration of the bill
(H. R. No. 666) making appropriations for the
diplomatic and consular expenses of the Gov-
ernment, for the yearending June 30,1860, upon
which the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr.
Keitt] was entitled to the floor.
REVOLUTIONARY CLAIMS.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I ask the gentleman
from South Carolina to allow me to give notice
that on Monday next I shall call up House bill
No. 234, the object of which is to settle the ac-
counts and claims of officers and soldiers of the
war of the Revolution.
ACQUISITION OF CUBA.
Mr. KEITT. Mr. Chairman, the expediency
of acquiring Cuba has been brought prominently
before us in the recent annual message of the Pres-
ident. For more than thirty years, the instincts
of the people of the United States have gathered
around that island, and have exacted from differ-
ent Administrations assurances of its conquest or
purchase in certain political or social contingen-
cies. That its acquisition is surrounded with em-
barrassments, is true; but it would be strange if
any great object m life was attained without some
risk or sacrifice.
Is the importance of Cuba to us commensu-
rate with .the efforts necessary to obtain and hold
it? The answer to this inquiry will result from
an examination into its geographical position, its
resources, and its political and commercial con-
nection with this country.
What is its geographical position ? A glance at
the map will show you that Cuba is within easy
reach of the coast of Florida—situated between
that State and the peninsula of Yucatan. It is
the gate to the Gulf of Mexico, and commands
both it and the West India seas. It is so propi-
tiously planted, that, in the hands of a strong na-
val Power, it would make the Gulf of Mexico a
mare clausum. Thus it keeps ward and pass over
our commerce from New Orleans to New York,
and from Now York and our other ports, through
the Isthmus transits, to our possessions on the
Pacific coast. And what is the value of that com-
merce? It already reaches $500,000,000 annu-
ally, and is enlarging with such rapid strides that
the resources of arithmetic will ultimately fail to
compute it. One of the richestand fairest regions
of the earth, too, uses the Gulf of Mexico as an
outlet for its productions. The Gulf is the reser-
voir of the Mississippi river and all its magnificent
tributaries; and hence it receives the almost fab-
ulous commerce of the region drained by these.
The country thus drained, is equal to half of Eu-
rope in extent, covering twenty-five degrees of
latitude and thirty-five of longitude on the great
circles of the globe. It extends from the summit
of the Alleghany to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains, embracing climates of every variety,
and productions of every kind. Already nearly
ten millions of people inhabit it. What intellect
is audacious enough to predict how numerous its
population will yet be? The highways of com-
merce, too, are changing,and the hoarded wefiUh
of the East, now startled from the sleep of centu-
turies, will, in its transit"to the West, cover the
waters of the Gulf of Mexico. You may unite
the Atlantic and Pacific shores with bands of iron,
but this commerce will stdl seek the Gulf; for
water is the master of commerce.
The geographical position of Cuba is also im-
portant to us m a military point of view. Mr.
Stevenson, in 3837, while Embassador at the
Court of St. James, in a letter to Mr. Forsyth,
Secretary of State, said that—
"The possesion of Cuba, by a great maritime Power
would be Intle le-ss than the establishment of a fortification
atthe mouth of the Mississippi, commanding both the Gulf
of Mexico and Florida, and consequently the whole trade
of the western Suites be^j/los deeply affecting the interest
and tranquillity of the southern portion of the Union."
Mr. Buchanan, while Secretary of State, used
the following language in his instructions to Mr.
Saunders, in 1848:
" Cuba, in the po^e-sion of Great Rntain, or any strong
| naval Power, imirht piovp runioiK both to our foreign and
domestic commerce, and even endangei the union of the
States."
John Forsyth said, in 1822, while at the Court
of Madrid, that " tin: possession of Cuba gave the
command of the Gulf of Mexico." Mr. Adams,
in 1823, in his instructions to Mr. Nelson, says:
" Its [Cuba] commanding position with reference to the
Cuif of Mexico and the West India sea4*, &c., gives it an
importance in the sum of our national interests vvitii which
that ot no other foreign terntoiy can be compared."
Lieutenant Dahlgren, an accomplished officer
of the Navy, in his report on fortifications, says:
k< The true and only key, however, to the defense of thepo
«hor<>«, and to the nnmmwe inteioM there collected, is the
Havana. The Mand to which it belong enteisits western
extreme in the Culf, leaving but two passages for ve-sel?*,
&o narrow as to be commanded with the irrenteet facility ;
these are thegM-auh&sou'iiil.trc.-oftradoand the mail steam-
ers from New OileaAsto California and New York. Hence,
if the u-c of the Havana be even .it the du-po;al of an enemy
while in the hanrh of a neutral Power, each and all of these
interests could he with difficulty defended, even by appe-
llor naval foiee. and neverguaiantied against severe loasea..
While fiom it, as a United State- port, a squadron of mod-
erate size would cover the southeast and Gulf coa?ts, pro-
tect the foreign and inshore traders, and secure the lines
fiom New York or New Oileans to the Pacific States by
way of the KthmiH, its occupation would neees&anly be
the object of every expedition, military or naval, prelum
nary to any attempt on the southern trade or territory."
The importance of the acquisition of Cuba, in
u military point of view, is somewhat diminished
by the application of new motive power to ves-
sels, and the consequent modification of the sys-
tem of naval warfare. But still it is of great use
as a muniment of protection to our southern
coasts and our inshore traders.
The expediency of acquiring Cuba is also con-
nected with the question of her resources. What
are they ? The Island of Cuba runs from cast to
west through its main extent, and is computed io
be some seven hundred miles in length, with a
maximum" breadth of seventy-nine mUes, and a
mimmu.m one of twenty-three miles. Its area is
variously estimated between forty thousand three
hu-ndred and eighty-eigHt andihirty-four thou-
sand two hundred and thirty-three square miles.
Of the thirty million seven hundred and forty-one
thousand acres included in the superficies of the
island, there are not more than eight million un-
der cultivation. This computation isfounded upon
the authority and figures of Arboleya's work tin
the Island of Cuba.
The main agricultural productive energies of
Cuba turn upon the cultivation of the sugar-cane,
coffee, tobacco, vegetables, and fruits, together
with the breeding of cattle, under our generic name
of stock. Its productions are the result of the
cultivation of sugar estates—in number, 1,485, of
which 893 are worked by steam; coffee plantations,
1,813; tobacco plantations, 1,102; fincas, or graz-
ing-farms, 9,930; cstancias, or rural farms, 25,292.
Arboleya, in'his tables for 1852, enumerates the
productions of Cuba for that year as follows:

Other products not calculated  180.522 00
Total agticultuial products of the year  53,014,000 00
The total animal products of the same year,
(1852,) he enumerates as follows: For the bovine
races, $20,652,732; for the equine races ,§7,667,010;
for other animals, $5,247,350: total, $33,567,092.
A more reliable exppnent,- however, of the
wealth of Cuba, will be found in an examination
of the imports and exports of the .island. The
following ia an authentic table for the year 1853:

But large as these tables are, they do not rep-
resent the full commercial transactions of tho
island. Tq prove that the actual value of the com-
merce of the island reaches a higher figure than
that stated above, it is sufficient to say that it does
not include the amount represented by the intro-
duction of slaves; nor is allowance made for tho
system ofbribery in universal use among the fis-
cal agents of the Government. Saco, the best in-
formed Cuban whom I know, sets down tho
number of slaves clandestinely introduced, at ten
thousand a year. These, at §400 each, the mini-
mum price, represent a commercial transaction of
$4,000,000 per annum.
The general system of smuggling, which is no-
toriously known to exist in the-ports of Cuba, and
the equally notorious tendency to willful and con-
venient blindness on the part of the fiscal agents,
warrant the best informed writers in calculating
the amount cut off from the lawful revenue at one
fourth of the whole amount; or, m round num-
bers, at §17,000,000.
Now, the official returns give, for imports and
exports, a basis of commercial transactions, reach -
ing the sum of $59,000,000, adding to -which the
probable $21,000,000, represented by the trade in
