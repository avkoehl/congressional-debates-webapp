HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 29, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

General-in-Chief:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit inclosed telegrams* just received from General Reynolds at Little Rock, and General Dodge at Fort Leavenworth. They are only important as showing that all guerrillas and bushwhackers who have disturbed the peace in Arkansas and Missouri are rapidly surrendering. I hope that entire quiet will soon be restored in Arkansas and Missouri, and in that view I would be glad to know whether my suggestions for the restoration of civil law and administration in Arkansas, submitted in my letter to the President, are approved. I think some steps toward that end should be adopted as soon as possible.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 29, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to request that the following officers of my staff be breveted for services set opposite their names, respectively. As the staff officers of Major-General Curtis and other generals serving in this military division have been honored for services, in my judgment neither so important nor so conspicuous, it seems only fair that the officers on my staff be also promoted. First, Lieutenant Colonel Fred. Myers, additional aide-de-camp and chief quartermaster, Military Division of the Missouri, to be brevet brigadier-general, for distinguished services in the campaign of the Army of Virginia and for highly meritorious service as chief quartermaster, Department of the Northwest and of Military Division of the Missouri; second, Captain J. McC. Bell, assistant adjutant-general, to be lieutenant-colonel by brevet, for distinguished services in the campaign of the Army of Virginia and since in the Department of the Northwest and of Military Division of the Missouri; third, Captain D. Pope, additional aide-de-camp, for distinguished services in the campaign of the Army of Virginia and since in the Department of the Northwest and Military Division of the Missouri. None of these officers have received any promotion whatever for these services.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, May 29, 1865-5 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

I have given directions to General Reynolds to have in readiness one division of infantry, say 5,000 strong, to be sent to Shreveport. Its transportation will be furnished by General Allen, the chief quartermaster, the division to embark on its arrival.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
