company of cavalry report to you. Avoid any difficulty with Kansas. If you know of any one harboring guerrillas report them to me by telegraph.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., January 5, 1865.

General FISK:

Yesterday I sent two companies out, one to the Blue and one (mounted) to Hickman's. Will press horses and give receipts. They will be returned. Bushwhackers were gathering to rob the Saint Louis mail, which now comes via Independence.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel Forty-third Missouri Volunteers.

MACON, January 5, 1865.

Major-General DODGE, Saint Louis:

Hines, of Boone, and " Forty" Campbell, of Howard, both noted guerrillas of North Missouri, have been killed. The latter was found in and artificial cave about two miles from Fayette. It was decidedly the hole of a copperhead. Jim Jackson has been severely, I trust mortally, wounded. Our troops are on the alert and weeding out the villains daily and nightly.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 5, 1865.

Brigadier-General FISK, Macon:

What do you hear about the troubles in Howard and Boone? Who is to work down there? Had not a mounted force better be sent to look after them?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

MACON, MO., January 5, 1865-5 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

We have in Boone and Howard all the mounted force we can possibly spare from other points. The best mounted troops we have are stationed at Rocheport, Fayette, and Glasgow, and are doing very good service. We suffer for the want of horses.

C. B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, MO., January 5, 1865-8 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

I see by this morning's Democrat what I suppose called out your dispatch of to-day. "Lincoln," the correspondent, misrepresents the case most wickedly. Five companies of the Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia are in Howard and Boone doing good service.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
