been less useful, or found his cares and responsibilities less embarrassing in the 'security from danger" which he has enjoyed in the discharge of his official duties, than they were when he occupied a position in the field.

I am perfectly willing that the hardy, wayworn veterans of Georgia who are kept in the frontmfortable office, and no command in the rear, who left their wives and little ones to defend your large inheritance, as well as their own log cabins, to whom, when naked and barefoot in the dreary storms of winter, I have sent clothes and shoes when they could get none from the Confederacy, and whose poor, helpless wives and little ones I have labored day and night to procure appropriations, and get up supplies to feed and clothe, when suffering for food and raiment, shall judge whether my services have been more valuable in my present position than they could have been in the field, however a good soldier I might have been able to make; and whether I have indeed been their friend, or, as you would intimate, only their "pretended friend. " I am as well content to abide their judgment now as I was last fall when, with remarkable unanimity, they gave me assurances that they were my friends, which were as gratifying to me as they were mortifying to conflict croakers and enemies of the State government, who had spent more time and labor in misrepresenting my motives and my acts and attempting to convince the people at home that the Army was almost a unit against me, than they had in providing for the wants of the soldiers or the comfort of their families at home.

You call attention to the number of militia officers in this State, and refer to my statement in my late message that if the act of Congress is executed in the State it deprives her of her whole active militia; and you say the act is now being executed which leaves these militia officers to take "military charge of themselves," for, say you, "they constitute in and of themselves their entire and sole command.

Now, it does seem to be a little remarkable that a Confederate major-general of the reserves, who you say are to be left to the "easier duties" "in the rear," in which others who are to "join their comrades int he field" are "at present engaged," should conclude that he is entitled to a monopoly in the easier duty in the rear, and should assume that his own reserves are the only reserves. I beg you to remember that the laws of this State provide militia reserves, who are to participate with you in the discharge of those "easier duties" "in the rear," and who, when the active militia- or militia proper- have gone, may in great emergencies be called out to "repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or execute the laws. " If, when the active Confederate soldiery have been called for the discharge of the "easier duties" "in the rear" to "join their comrades in the field," you, as the commander of the Confederate reserves, find other occupation than the military charge of yourself, experience may soon teach you what use there may be for officers of the militia reserves after the active militia have gone to the field. The great desire on your part seems to be that these officers of the militia reserves shall be transferred from their present reserve service to the Reserve Corps under your command.

Their "official retreats" in command of reserves seems to annoy you, but you have no objection to their "privates retreat," as reserves, if placed under your control. In other words, it seems to be a question
