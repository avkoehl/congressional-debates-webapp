Abolition Petitions—Mr. Morris.
Senate 
tion by bounties further, or at least as far, as its
most strenuous advocates have ever required.
Mr. Madison's motion for commercial restnc-
tions, in the House of Representatives, on the
14th February, 1806, emphatically declares " that
the inteiests of the United States should be pro-
moted by fuither restrictions and lugho duties, in
ríitam cases, on the manufactures and navigation
of foreign nations employed in the commerce of
the United States " The principle of the impo-
sition of duties for protection standing forth as a
naked column to the view of the eye, is enforced
in this measure, proposed by that wise and patii-
otic statesman The íestrictive measures of Mr
Jefferson's administration, the embargo and non-
intercourse, breathed hope into, and gave vitality
to> the great manufacturing interests These were
southein measures, sustained by enlightened
statesmen fiom all the vauous sections of this
widely extended country.
With those evidences of encouragement and
protection to the navigating, manufactuung, and
agricultural interests, existing on the records of
national legislation anteuoi to the late war, how
can any man yield an unqualified assent to the
position taken m this repoit' The colonial pol-
icy of Gieat Butain was to pievent the colonists
fiom spreading a sail upon the ocean, or manu-
facturing even a " hob nail " The declaration
of independence and the successful termination
of the levolutionary war severed forever the po-
litical vassalage which Great Butain ever held
ovei this country Yet, if we had remained de-
pendent on het tor a supply of all the munitions
of war necessaiy for national defense, and for
the clothing «e weai, wt would have still been
in comnieicial pupilage and vassal tgo to that
Powei No people can be fiee and independent
^ ho have not within themselves the means of
defense against the invasion of a foreign enemy,
and the necessaiy clothing and breadstuff's to
protect and sustain its population Grain, the
gieat agucultuial staple of the State I have the
honor in part to íepiesent, hasieceived a piotec-
tion of twenty-five cents per bushel So abun-
dant has heretofoie been the supply, that it is
only within the last year or two that any consid-
erable amount of that amele has been imported
into the country. The peculiar circumstances
that biought about this result w.ll not, in all hu-
man probability, occur foi yeais again I would
ask, are not the interests of an enlightened, in-
telligent, and bold yeomanry, the tillers of the
soil, the stay and defendéis of the lights and lib-
erties of the countiy, worthy oí the piotection
and encouiagement of then own Government'
Commtice, agnculture, and manufactures, aie
twin handmaidens, each necessary to the pros-
petity of the othei A common interest msepai-
ably ]oins them together, when eithei languishes
and is depiessed, the othei s equally suffei I
am no advocate for excessive duties and high
taitffs, which would again produce a bloated
Treasury All we lpqiure is uniformity and sta-
bility in your revenue laws, and such discumma-
tion in the imposition of duties necessaiy to
laise sufficient íevenue to supply the economical
wants of the Treasury as will best protect, pie-
serve, and encouiage, the great and leading intei-
ests of commeice, agricultme, and manufactuies
I am no advocate for diawing money, by either
duect oi indirect taxation, out of the means of
the people, unless it is wanted for the pui poses
of sustaining the Government and maintaining
" the common defense and general welfare "
Mr. WILLIAMS, of Tennessee, called the
gentleman from Pennsylvania to oider, alleging
that it was not in order to discuss the tariff on a
bill for the issue of Tieasury notes
Mr CHARY (who temporarily occupied the
chan) decided that the gentleman was not out of
oider.
Mr POTTER proceeded I should have con-
cluded before this the observations which I had
contemplated to make if the gentleman had not
interposed I but follow the example which those
who pieceded me had set m this debate In my
humble judgment, manufactures have suffeied
moie from the uncertainty and fluctuations of
legislation, fiom the wantof reliance in the stead-
iness and conunuanceof any paruculai system of
duties, than all the advantages den ved by the high
duties imposed by the piovisions of the acts of
1828 and 1832 Certainty and stability of legis-
lation will enable them to accommodate their
business to the existing state of the country
Give to these leading interests of the countiy that
ceitam and moderate protection arising from the
judiciousairangement of impost duties, necessary
to raise revenue to supply the wants of the Tieas-
ury when the Government is administered on the
most economical scale, necessary for the protec-
tion of the country and the advancement of its
piospenty,and you will do moie, infinitely moie,
foi the certain and steady advancementof the ag-
ncultural and manufacturing interest than was
accomplished by high tariffs, accompanied by in-
cessant changes and violent political convulsions
Representing a great agricultural and manufac-
turing district, a sense of duty to my constituents
has constrained me to make the remarks which
have fallen from me " Sufficient for the day is
the evil thereof" Hereaftei, when it becomes
necessary to readjust the revenue laws and the
tauff of duties, if I am honoied by a seat on this
ilooi, I trust I shall be enabled to enter upon that
duty in the spn it of forbeaiance, conciliation, and
compromise, which produced the Constitution
under which we are assembled here, and that the
interests of all sections of our common country
may be preseived without essential injury to the
interests of any
My thanks are due to the House for the indul-
gence which has been accorded to me.
ABOLITION rETTTIONS
SPEECH OF HON. THOS. MORRIS,
OF OHIO,
In iiie Senate, Fefouanj 9, 1839,
On presenting certain petitions for the aboluion of the slave
trade in the Di&tuct of Columbia, &.c
Mr MORRIS said-
Mr President I rise to present for the con-
sideration of the Senate numeious petitions, signed
by, not only citizens of my own State, but citi-
zens of seveial othei States,New Yoik, Pennsyl
vama, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana These
petitioners, amounting in number to several thou-
sand, have thought pioper to make me their'or-
gan in communicating to Congress theii opinions
and wishes on subjects which, to them, appear
of the highest importance These petitions,
sir, are on the subject of slavery, the slave trade
as carried on within and from tins District, the
slave ttade between the different States of this
Confediiacy, between this country and Texas,
and against the admission of that country into the
Union, and also against that of any other State
whose constitution and liws recognize or permit
slavery I take this opportunity to piesent all
these petitions together, having detained some of
them foi a consideiable time in my hands, in ol-
der that as small a portion of the attention of the
Senate might be taken up on then account as
would be consistent with a stuct legaid to the
lights of the petitioners And I now present them
under the most peculiar circumstances that his
evei piobably transpned in this or any other coun
try I present them on the heel of the petmqns
which have been presented by the Senator from
Kentucky, [Mi Ci ay,] signed by the inhabitants
of this District, praying that Congiess would not
receive petitions on the subject of slavery in the
District from any body of men or citizens but
themselves This is something new, it is one of
the devicesof the slave power,and most extiaoi-
dmaiyin itself These petitions I am bound in
duty to present—a duty which I cheerfully per
foim, for I considei it not only a duty but an
honor. The lespectable names which these pe-
titions bear, and being against a practice which I
as deeply depiecate and deplore as they can pos-
sibly do, yet I well know the fate of these peti
tions, and I also know the time, place, and dis-
advantage uiidei which I present them
In availing myself of this opportunity to ex-
plain my own views on this agitating topic, and
to explun and justify the chai icter and proceed
nigs of these petitioners, it must be obvious to all
that I am surrounded by no ordinary discourage-
ments. The strong prejudice which is evidenced
by the petitioners of the District, the unwilling-
ness of the Senate to hear, the power which is ar*
rayed against me on this occasion, as well as in
opposition to those whose rights I am anxious tj>
maintain, opposed by the veiy lions of debate in
this body, who aie cheered on by an applauding
gallery and surrounding interests, is enough to
produce dismay m one fai more able and eloquent
than the lone and humble individual who now ad-
dresses you. What, sir, can there be to induce
me to appear on this public aiena, opposed by
such powerful odds? Nothing, sir, nothing but
a strong sense of duty,and adeep conviction that
the cause I advocate is just, that the petitioneis
whom Irepiesentare honest, upright, intelligent,
and lespectable citizens, men who love then coun-
tiy, who are anxious to promote its best interests,
and who are actuated by the purest patriotism,
as well as the deepest philanthiopy and benevo-
lence In representing such men, and m sucha,
cause, though by the most feeble means, one
would suppose that, on the floor of the Senate of
the United States, order, and a decent respect toi
the opinions of others, would prevail From the
causes which I have mentioned, I can hardly hops
foi this I expect to proceed through scenes
which ill become $us Hall; "but nothing shall de-
ter me from a full and faithful discharge of my
duty on this impoitaot occasion.
Peimit me,su, toíemindgentlemen thai! have
now been six years a member of this body I
have seldom, perhaps too seldom,, in the opinion
of many of my constituents, pressed myself upon
the notice of the Senate, and taken up their time
in useless and w ndy debate I question very
much if I have occupied the time of the Senate*
dunng the sik yeais as some gentlemen have
during sin; week?, or even six days I hope,
theiefore, that I shall not be thought obtrusive,
or chaiged with taking up time with abolition
petitions I hope, Mr President, to hear no more
about agitating this slave question here Who
has begun the agitation now' The Senator from
Kentucky, [Mr Clay ] Who has responded to
that agitation, and congratulated the Senate and
the country on its results' The Senator fiom
South Carolina, [Mi. Calhoun ] And pray, sir,
under what circumstances is this agitation begun >
Let it be remembered, let us collect the facts from
the records on your table, that when I, as a mem-
ber of this body, but a few days smce offered a
ícsolution as the foundation of proceedings on
these petitions, gentlemen, as if operated on by
an electric shock, sprung fiom their seats and,
objected to its introduction And when, you, sir,
decided that it was the right of every member to
introduce such motion or lesolution as he pleased,
being responsible to his constituents and this
body for the abuse of this right,gentlemen seemed
to wondci that the Senate had no power to pie-
vent the action of one of its members in cases
like this, and the poor privilege of having the
¡esolution printed, by order of the Senate, was
denied
Let the Senator from South Carolina before me
remember that, at the last session, when he offered
lesolutions on the subject of slavery, they were
not only received without objection, but printed,
voted on, and decided, and let the Senator fiom
Kentucky reflect that the petition which he offered
against oui right was also leceived and oidered
to be punted without a single dissenting voice,
and I call on the Senate and the country to re-
member that the resolutions which I have offered
on the same subject have not only been lefused
the punting, but have been laid upon the table
without being debated ot íeferred Posterity,
which shall read the pioceedmgs of this time,
may well wondei what power could induce the
Senate of the United States to proceed in such a
strange and contradictoiy manner Permit me
to tell the countiy now what this powei behind
the throne, gieater than the thtone itself, is, It
I is the powei of slavery It is a power, accord-
ing to the calculation of tne Senator from Ken-
tucky, which owns §1,200,000,000 m hum-in be-
ings, es pioptitj, and if money is powei, this
powei i-> not to be conceived oi calculated, a
power which c'aims human propeity more than
double the amount which the whole money of the
woild could punhase     What can stand befoie
