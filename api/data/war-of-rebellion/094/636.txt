President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

Generals Steele and A. J. Smith are reported to be re-enforcing General Thomas at Nashville. Cannot I send General E. Kirby Smith to re-enforce General Hood in Middle Tennessee, or taken offensive in Missouri? His assistance is absolutely necessary at this time.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

DECEMBER 4, 1864.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

If General Smith can now act as suggested it would be well that he should do so. There is no objection to his being called on, but he has failed heretofore to respond to like necessities, and no plans should be based on his compliance.
