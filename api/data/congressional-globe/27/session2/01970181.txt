that it was palpably unconstitutional to assume ot act on any
such ground The Constitution says that in a case of that land

this House took hold of him Who had the prior right to do
sol Could this Hou&e respond to the demanJ of the magistrate
or sheriff who had a warrant foi his arrest, that it denied the
right of the civil authoi lties to interfere, because it was a ques-
tion of privilege, and this House would therefuie try him fust?
This would be a violation of the Con&utuüon, if the House did
not give the individual up whenever he was demanded, to an
swer for the offence, by the civil authorities
But gentlemen might say that the effect ollhis doctrine would
be that, however base a man might be or however atrocious
the crimes which he might have committed he would be thus
declared a fit associate foi the members of this House, and that
they could not expel him Noriseytiitur On the contrary, if
he weie thus so bise i rharactei, the members of this House
might themselves become his accusers, and secute themselves
against hi* contaminating influence And if he were acquitted
bv that tribunal, it appeared to him (Mr IT ) to be a matter of
doubt «¿whether the House could readjudicate m ordei to screen
themselves from the contamination
Mi IT hete alluded to thecal ofthe impeachment of Sena
tor Smith, which led tn some explanations m lelation to that
case from Mr Adams
Mr U said he would not go again over the argument which
he had made on the former occasion, to which he had alluded
If gentlemen wished to know what the grounds he had taken
were, they couid turn to hit, remarks, he had no idea that gen
tlenaen here would feei sufficient interest in them to do so, but
he wished those at home to look and see what they were
Mr XT then adverted to the indefinite and unsettled character
and extent of the privileges of the member*, of Congress, and to
the necessity of defining what they were
He objected, then, to the power of this House is this caceas
being wanted And he objected for another reason If the
House had the power to punish, what punishment should it
inflict? If the gentleman from Mas&achus* Us was guilty of
treason or subornation of perjuiy, it was to his (Mr U 's) mind
worse than bathos to sty he should be reprimanded lithe
change was true, expulsion was *oo mill a punishment too
was hie and imprisonment infinitely too mill It he was a
traitoi, hanging should be the [ uniohment which should be in-
flicted
[Mr Marshall again denied, m the most emphatic manner
as he had done yes eiday, ihattheie was any such charge made
against Mr Adams ]
Mr Underwood areued that if the gentleman fiom Ma-^a
rhusetts had been guilty 01 the implication charged ur on him
in the íesolution—if he weie in heart and in sml a tiauor—
hanging was a more propci punishment than rcj limand
Mr U then contended that this procetung would hem vio
lation of the clause of the Constitution which savs that ciuel y
unusual punishments should not be inflicted, (the word ' unu
sua!" here meaning tho^e which were not prescribed befoie
hand,) and that ess fost facto law  atnuld not be passed,

God? So it was with reference to the civil lestitutiona of the
countiy Thoso m Massachusetts had no right to piay for a
thing which belonged to him, and htm alone It was nothing
but arrogance and claim to superiority, and he piayed to them,
if hiá prayei could be heard, to put up no such prayers Let
usalone, (continuedhe,) we think we understand our own mte
rests, and are capable of ^carrying them out It was on this
ground that if the question made by the gentleman from Vngi
ma"(Mr W > was persisted in—and he hoped the gentleman
would not withdraw it—if they even came back to the recep
tion of the petition, he hoped they would have adirectvote
taken, and let each gentleman say whether they would receive
the petition or not, when they had no power to grant its
priyei
His physical stiensth would not enable him to go through all
the arguments to show in what the right of petition consisted
It consisted m asking of those who have authority to gtant
something which affects the individuals asking—in asking for
the passage or repeal of a law which opet ales on he petitioners,
and if it d d not operaie on them, they had no privilege to pe
tition concerning it Ifthe existenceofslavuy in theDistiict
of Columbia couid be shown to operate on a man fivehunrjred
mile=! ofThe could petition concerning it, but if it did not, he had
no more authority, on the principles of natural justice and mo
ials, to throw m his petition for their consideration than a man
m England or Russia, and it was the failuie to put forward aov
oints on this great subject to define the light oi petition, which
ad caused all the mischief and confusion on this subject He
knew there were men here who did not wantto do it Why
were thp<e eternaragi tat ions'* With some for political effect,
with some for religious and moral considerations, according to
their conception, with some for one motive, and with others for
another but all concurring in this, that eternal agitation on
this subject is to be kept up for the purpose of accomplishing
a manumission of slaves and the abolition of slavery in dif
ferent poi tions of this Union, and, he Would add, as a gentleman
from thesisveholrhng States remarked, with some for theac
comphshment of their own private purposes There was
nothmsr patriotic in neglecting to take up this question and put
iton somp basis which the people of the countiy could under
stand Since he had been a member here, as a slaveholder
anda Repiesentative from a slaveholdmg State, he had de
sired nothing so anxiously as that the people of the North
should take up this subject and debate it to tne fullest extent
He was not afiaid to let any body talk about it, and when thry
came to do it hewouldshow that the condition in which they
were placed m a moral and political aspect was not, peihaps
worse than that of the other Stales, and if was, that they w ere
not to blame for it They could ti ace it back to the policy of

before him said u should not be He thanked hnn for the sentí-
ment He hoped if these petitioners were actu iteü by anysucri
motive, as he had supposed they mightbc, if they had addressed
this petition here seriously with this nefarious purpose, which,
although it did not amount to treason, yet invited treason, he
hoped that there were no more than these forty five persops who
entertained a design s>o fatal He wanted to say to Abolitionists
on this floor that the doctrine nf their creed so far as he under-
stood them, was this that nothing would satisfy them short of
emancipating then slaves, and placing them on an equality with
themselves in. regard to religious and moral rights IK would
appeal to the gentleman [Mr Giddings] beloit him if this was
not their doctrine
Mr GIDDÍNGS said it gave him gt eat pleasure to respond
to the feelings which the honorable membei had expressed To
all those sentiments which he had uttered he responded from
his inmost soul He would also say that he was an Abolí
tiomstto the fu1! ex'ent m which he understood that term.
That he had conversed v/ith hundreds,and p-rhapshe might
saythous nds, but he had never heard one in mate any inter-
tion or wish to interfere politically with the institution ofelave
ry m Kentucky or any othel State They claim no such light,
nor do they ask any suchpiivilege Gentlemen may consider
him as speaking ex cathedi a if they choose He would thers
say that all imputations and charges of 'heir desire to do saf
weie, so far as he was informed, unfououed On the contrary,
they ask to be relieved fiom such interference and taxation foi
the supportqf slavery They ask that it should not interfere
with thein. Let us cease to appropriate the money of the fifie
States for the support of slaveiy Let Congress cease to in-
volve the fiee States m the disgrace or support of that institu-
tion and they wil I be satisfied as to political action
Mr UNDERWOOD continued He was happy to hear the
gentleman say that Kentucky should not suffer undi r any
emergency and that he {Mr G ] would stand by her ae long as
Mr U would standby Ohio 1 here was one little qualifica-
tion m the concluding sentence of the t entleman from Ohio
which he did not thoioughly explain, that he wanted to be
exempt from taxation and tobe delivered from all connection
