Major-General CROOK,Cumberland:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that your explanation+ is satisfactory, and he takes pleasure in believing that you assumed the command of the Department West Virginia without reflecting upon the position your action placed him in. He would be very glad to see you at Winchester, but the nature of the orders heretofore transmitted to you will prevent. The general directs me further to say that, in view of your telegram and the fact that your orders contemplate immediate and active service for you, he releases you entirely from arrest.
