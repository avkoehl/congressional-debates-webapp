is a consummation devoutly to be wished, but on the|other
hand, li ne should decline the exercise of so high and responsi-
b!e a power, and renew the deposite system, it would make a
most unfortu tare and dangerous change m the issue between
usand tbosv who are opposed to us on this important question
!t would be no lunger between a bank and the constituted Trea
sury aa it now is, bur between a deposite system with and with-
out iaw>as it was prior to the passage of the deposite act of '36,
id which ouropponents would have the advantage of advoca-
ting law against discretion It is a position which we could
not maintain, and on which T do not choose to be put.
What 'oorse the Chief Magistrate might take if this bill
should become a law, I have no means of knowing or ronjectm
i tg; but if heshouid act in the spirit of his message at the open-
ing of this and the extra sessions, he would not heshatp, be the
responsibility what it may, and as I have no reason to doubt his
sincerity on this great question, I hope and trust he Would so
act, should Congress, gi\e him the power It would close the
door agaiRst many a calamity about to i ush into the State, and
do more than has ev er been done by an Executiv e act to restore
the ascendency of the laws and Constitution But be his deter
mi nation what it may, I cannot agree to vnLe for the bill My
principles have been long fixed and acted on in relation to dis
en 'lonary power, and m voting against this measure, I but act
in conformity to them

Mi. BRIGGS moved that it be read at large, which having
been dime,
Mr CAMBRELENG explained its provisions and the neces
sityof the measure, called foi by the existing circumstances of
the State banks conflicting with the impeiative lestnetions of
the deposite act of 36
Mi MENEFEE replied, and quoted Mr Wright's report to
prove that the Secretary of the Trea«ury had the powei to de
sígnate other depositones than those which had already been
employed, in which opinion Mr M expressed his own con-
cuirence, and went on at length to oppose the bill; the effect of
which, he insisted, was to put the whole finances of the coun
try withm the arbitrary control of the Executive
Mi LEGARE stated his belief that a more extraordinary
proposition had never been presented *o that body for itsconsi
deration, and gave veiy briefly the reasons that jvould induce

The House then íesumed the consideration of the bill from
the Senate ' to modify the last clause of the 5th section of the
depositeacf ofthc23d June lSub, and foro her purposes "
TI ne pendme attentions were oi its third readme:, and on the
motion of Mr LEGARE, to refer if o the Committpe of Way«
and Means
Mr DUNCAN concluded lus remarks m support of the
system to dissolve Governments and banks
Mr LEGARE then withdrew his motion to commit, and
moved to strikeout the second section of the bill, which was as
follows
Sec 2 Arid be it furthei enacted, That the first twelve
section" of the act entu'ed *' An act to regulate the deposite* of
the pubMc money," approved 23J June, 1836, be, and the same
aie hereby, repealed, except so far as is above provided, and
to enable the Treasury Department to collect any debts which
may be due or owing fro n the late deposite banks.
Mr ROBERTSON then had an amendment read, which he
proposed to submit at the proper time, pioviding-for the col-
lection of the public levenue according to the law of 1816, and
for its special deporte in State banks on certain conditions,
[substantially the same, we believe, as that he offered to the
independent Treasury bill some time since ] Mr It made
some remaiks in support of his pioposition, and then moved it
in the foim. of a substitute
SIi TILLINGHAS1 gave notice of in amendment he in-
tended to move at the propei stage, [similar to Mr WEB-
STER'S proposition offered in the Senate j He hoped the
previous question (which he was in favoi of this morning)
would not be moved, but that the HouoC woo. d have an oppor-
tunity of voting upon the different amendments that might be
pie&ented
Mr GRANT said he was \my sorry that he could not
accommodate the gentleman from Rhode Iblaud, but it seemed
utterly impossible to get any amendment to this bill [Several
members, Mi WILLIAMS of Kentucky andotheis exclaimed,
' Oh, move the previous question, I'll suppoit it "j He, for
one, was desirous that the bill should be amended in some par-
ticulars , but it appeared as though the subject was gong t 
be mtenninab'e , diid believing that to be the caso, and that it
was un necessaiy to waste anymore if the impoitant tune of
this session, he therefoie demanded the previous question.
