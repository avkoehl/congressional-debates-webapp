ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, March 24, 1862.

His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pa.:

SIR: In reply to your letter of the 18th instant, desiring information whether the detaching of an officer to the Signal Corps is held to create a vacancy open to a new commission, I have the honor to say that it does not. At present the officers performing duty with the Signal Corps are selected from regiments in service and are borne upon the rolls of their respective companies as belonging to them, but as absent on detached service.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
