Lieutenant Colonel LYNE STARLING,

Chief of Staff, Twenty-first Army Corps:

COLONEL: I inclose copy of letter from Colonel Minty.* He has informed me verbally that the rebels at first had a force of two brigades at Blythe's Ferry that has been since gradually increased to five brigades. I sent cavalry train to McMinnville this morning for supplies.

Is it the wish of the general commanding the corps that I should bring more supplies here than I could carry with me on a march? A small depot can be established here if thought advisable. It would be very convenient to draw upon if we should move forward.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
