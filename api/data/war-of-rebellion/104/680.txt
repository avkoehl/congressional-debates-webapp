MACON, GA., May 9, 1865-4.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Washington, D. C.:

Your telegram of 8 a. m. [7 p. m.], May 7, directing the arrest of Joseph E. Brown, was received at 3.40 p. m. to-day. Captain Kneeland, of my staff, is ordered to proceed at once by special train to Milledgeville to make the arrest and seize his papers. In the capitulation of the Georgia militia Brown, as commander-in-chief, was yesterday paroled, but his parole in no way acknowledge him as Governor.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., May 9, 1865-6 p. m.

Bvt. Major General J. H. WILSON:

You are right not to permit the Legislature of Georgia to assemble under the call of Governor Brown. The President will doubtless soon indicate what steps may be taken by the people to place the State of Georgia in a proper relation with loyal States. In the meantime I wish you to encourage the people in their efforts to re-establish civil law in their respective counties in accordance with the Georgia code in force prior to January, 1861, except that in all matters the negro must be regarded as a free man.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., May 9, 1865-4.45 p. m.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Your telegram in regard to the Governor of Virginia is just received.+ I have had no definite information of Davis' movements since he left Washington, but anticipating that he would go south I have sent a strong force down the Altamaha to the mouth of the Ohoopee, with directions to operate both north and south. I have also increased McCook's force in the direction of Tallahassee. Upton is well posted and active in Northern Georgia. Davis scattered the bulk of his gold and silver amongst his men and the citizens about Washington. I have directed it to be gathered up. I am collecting all military munitions, destroying none.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
