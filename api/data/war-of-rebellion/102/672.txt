in Minnesota in relation to the late Indian raid. I am very sorry to have done any injustice to officers of your staff in the matter of the publications in the Milwaukee Sentinel. I never supposed that you yourself had any knowledge that such publications had been made through information given at your headquarters. The reasons I assigned for not giving publicity to such matters, especially in exaggerated form, I think you will agree with me are conclusive. If you apprehend anything serious from that Chippewas it will be well to take immediate steps to prevent it. Hole-in-the-Day has long been a dangerous and troublesome character, and if he has been in any manner concerned in stirring up bad feeling among the Chippewas he ought to be arrested and held as a hostage at Fort Snelling, with such other Chippewa chiefs as are concerned in fomenting trouble. If you absolutely need another cavalry regiment in Minnesota I can probably manage to send one in a week or so. I cannot get a regiment sooner.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,
