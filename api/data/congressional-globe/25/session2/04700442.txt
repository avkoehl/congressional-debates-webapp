The Committee en Finance, to which was íeferred
the resolution of the Senite ol the  31st ultimo,
directing certain inquines as to various provi-
sions of an act entitled " An act to regulate the
dtposites of the public money," passed on the
23d day of June, 183G, respectfully report
The resolution insti ucts the committee  " to take
into consideration the act of the 23d of June, 1836,
entitled ' An act to regulate the deposites of the
public  money,' and to  make inquiry upon these
points, viz
First " Whether, according to the provisions of that act, it
is now c-imi etentfoi theSecretary ot the Tieasury to employ-
any bank which has hetetofoie been selected dy ft public clepo
ei oiy, and which since tlu. passage ol that act has suspended
specie payments
The committee have examined the act wi,h at-
tention, and find that, a'l oilier objections being ob-
viated, it is competent for the becretary of the
Treasmy to employ as a public depository, any
bank which has heretotoie been selected for that
service, " and v hich, since the passage of that act,
has suspended specie pa) men's   The eighth sec-
tion of the deposite act prohibits the Secretary of
the Treasury from discontinuing any deposite bank,
and from w ihdramng the public money therefrom,
except 'or certain enumerated causes, one of which
is m the following words
1 Or if any of said b i tks sha 1 it any time, refuse to pay us
own notes m specie, if d^ma ided '
Upon th s rinse being presented, it is made the
express dutv of ths Secretary, by the same section
of the act, "to discontinue any such bank as a
depositors, ?nd withdraw from it the public mo-
neys which it ma> hob! on deposite at the time of
such discontinuance," but when the bank shall have
again resumed «prepayments, nothing is found m
this language to mttrc'ict its re-selection asa public
depository
The fourth section of the act sets out the terms
and conditions upon which the banks shall agree
to receive the public moneys before they shall be
employed as depositories. The second of these
terms is prescribed in the following words:
"Secondly To credit as specie all sums deposited therein to
the credit ol the Treasurer of the United States, and to pay all
checks, wai rants, or drafts, drawn on such deposites, in specie,
if required by the holder thereof "
The breach of this condition, on the part of the
bank, would be a refusal to pay its depositors in
specie, and consequently a suspension, to that ex-
tent, of specie payments, and the duty of the Se-
cretary of the Treasury .to discontinue it, as a de-
pository, and to withdraw the public money from
it, would become imperative, by the language of
the eighth section, before referred to, which assigns,
as another cause ot discontinuance and withdrawal,
that, "at any time any one of said banks shall fail or
refuse to perform any of said duties, as prescribed
by this act, and stipulated to be performed by its
contract "
This contingency, therefore, like the former,
would take from the bank its character as a depo-
sitory, for the time being , would forfeit the exist-
ing contract, and render its discontinuance, and
the withdrawal of the public money from it, an
imperious duty; but the committee see nothing, in
either of the causes, to pre\enf a second contract
with the same bank, when it should ¿¡¡am resume
specie payments, again consent ''to pay its own
notes in specie, if demanded," and again "pay all
checks, warrants, or drafts, d'awn on the public
deposites, m specie, if required by the holder
thereof" They find no provision, in any other
part of the act, interdicting a second contract with
the same bank, when the first shall have been
terminated for eitner of these causes, and they
therefore express their opinion that "it is now com-
petent for the Secretary of the Treasury to employ
any bank which has heretofore been selected as a
public depository, and which, since the passage of
that act, has suspended specie payment*," there
being no other obstacle, in the way of such second
employment, than the act of suspension of specie
payments.
The next point to which the resolution directs
the inquiry of the committee, is in the following
words:
Second " Or which has, sine* the fourth day of July, ls36,
paid out notes, or bill", of a less denomination than five dol
lars "
To cause the inquiry to be clearly understood, it
is necessary to connect the preceding language with
the wotds above quoted, and the inquiry will be,
whether, according' to the provisions cif that act, [the
deposite law of 1836,] tí is now competent for the
Secretary of the Tieasury to employ any bank which
has, since thefourth day of July, 1836, paid out notes,
or bills, of a less denomination than five dolíais.
In answer to this inquiry, the committee find the
two first clauses of the fifth section of the act to be
in the following words:
"Sec 5 And be it fuither entitled, That no bank shall
be selected or cominucd, as aplace of depo&ite of ihe public
money which shall not redeem its notes and bills on dema d,
m specie, nor shall any bank be selected or continued, as afore-
said which shall, afcei tiie fomth day of July, m the year one
thousand eight bnrdredand thutysix, issue, oi pay out, any
note oi Dili of a less dei ommation than fi /e dolíais '
The last ot these clauses m^ets and answers the
inquiry directly, and shows that it is not competent
for the Secretary of the Treasury, under this act,
now to employ, as a pubbc depository, any bank
which has, since the fourth day of July, 1836,
either issued, or paid ot I, notes or bills of a less de-
nomination than five dollars while thp first clause
interdicts the selection or continuance, at any time,
and under any circumstances, of any bank " wh.ch
shall not redeem its notes and bills, on demand, in
specie "
These two points of the inquiry seem to the com-
mittee to assume the expediency of a course of le-
gislation, which shall revive and introduce again
into practice the deposite system established by the
act of 1836, as the system upon which the public
money is to be kept and disbursed Under this
supposition, the opinion of the committee, as to the
first inquiry, does not indicate the necessity of fur-
ther legislation, while the plain and unquestioned
construction of the act, as to the second, compels
an. answer which, to the minds of those who desire
the remtroduction of that system, may seem to point
out such a npcess ty
Not so with the majority of the committee
While left by the Senate to the free exercise of
their own opinions, they cannot recommend any
legislation, the eflfect of which will be to reunite the
public Treasury aad the banks, by a return of the
public treasure to the uses of banking; to stimulate
and compel the banks to discount upon the public
money, by exacting from them an interest for its
use; to promote an expansion in the paper issues of
the banks, exactly proportioned to the fertility of
the public revenues, and a correspondent em-
barrassment of the public Treasury, when a
sterility of revenue shall call for the public money
which has passed into the hands of the customers
of the banks Such, they believe, have been the
effects of the system of deposites, the revival of
which the resolution seems to contemplate. That
system compelled the deposite of all the public mo-
ney in banks, it placed it in those institutions upon
general deposite, and thus made it, m fact and in
law, the money of the banks, and not the money
of the people, it not only held out an inducement
to the banks to use the money for the purposes of
discount and banking, but, in this way, gave them
the right so to use it, in defiance of the popular
will, and of the public authorities, it went further,
and compelled them to convert it to some profita-
ble employment, by demanding interest from them
while it was in their keeping. Time and experi-
ence have shown the consequences of such a policy,
and, were there no other reason, these consequences
would forbid the committee from recommending
any legislation calculated, or intended, to revive
that system.
The action of the Senate, however, appears to
them equally to stand in the way of any such re-
commendation. A special convocation of Con-
gress, in September last, was a necessity imposed
by the failure of this system of deportes, and the
embarrassments to the public Treasury thereby oc-
casioned. Recommendations for the keeping and
management of the public money, without the aid
of the banks, and especially for a permanent sepa-
ration between the treasure of the people and the
business of banking, were then laid before Con-
gress by the President. These recommendations
were deliberately and definitively acted upon and
adopted by the Senate, but failed to receive the as-
sent of the other branch of Congress. At the com-
mencement of the present session, the same recom-
mendations, substantially, were renewed,and again
the Senate has, after long deliberation and debate,
adopted them, m the shape of a bill, and ihus sent
them to the House for its concurrence. If that
bill shall become a law, the whole deposite system
recogmsed and legalized by the deposite act of
1836, will be superseded. Will the Senate,
then, by its own action, supersede its own
bill? Will it, in the absence of all informa-
tion as to what may be the fate of that measure
m the co-ordinate branch of the Legislature, or
■ rather with the knowledge that it has not yet been
considered there, send another bill upon the same
general subject, based upon adverse principles'
The committee can only repeat, what they have
found it to be their duty to say upon a kindred branch
of this subject, that whether such duplicate action,
by the same legislative body, be consistent wit
established parliamentary law, with the economy
of legislation, or with the uniformity of decisions
which should characterize ad deliberative bodies,
are questions which properly address themselves
to the Senate and not to them , but upon the m r ts
of the propositions they must be permitted to feel
entire confidence that no sufficient reasons for a
change of opinion or action can be presented.
The remain ng inquiry embraced id the resolu-
tion is in the following words
" Third .And also to inquire into the, expediency of repeat
mg or modifying those provisions of th« said act, which pro
hibit the receipt inpayment oi debts and dues to the United
States ofthe bills oí all banks which issue bills of less denomi
nation than five dollars "
This inquiry relates to the last clause of the 5di
section of the act, whioh reads as follows •
" Noi shall the notes or bills of any bank le c vul in
payment of any debt due to the United Mate 1 s all,
af er the said fomth day of July, m t e yeir one tliu md eight
hundiedandthnty six issue any nole or b'U of a 1 i.et omi
nation than five dollai   "
This pi o vision of the law of 1836, was inserted
in furtherance of a policy some years since adopted
by Congress, as will be seen by the 8th section of
the proposed recharter of the Bank of the United
States of the year of 1832, which reserved to Con-
gress the power, from and after the 3d of March,
