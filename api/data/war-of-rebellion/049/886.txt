In answer to His Excellency the Governor of Florida, who recommended the return of the brigade to the State, I stated it could be done in my opinion if a full regiment was sent to take its place until its ranks could be filled. If this cannot be done, I recommend that the brigade be consolidated into a regiment. I should much regret for the brigade to lose its identity. It has served long and faithfully; but I have tried every way to recruit its ranks without success. If this brigade was sent to Florida, others equally deserving could not be denied a similar indulgence, and the army would be broken up.

R. E. LEE,

General.
