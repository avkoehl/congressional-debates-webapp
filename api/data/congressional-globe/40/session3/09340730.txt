in the kingdom of Belgium; recites that they
have mail contracts with Belgium and an equip-
ment and appointment which will enable them
to carry the ocean mail3 of the United States
for simply the postage, without guarantee or
inducement for doing it, and praying that they
may be permitted to take the ocean-going let-
ters and mail matter of the United States,

resolutions of the Legislature of Missouri, in-

resentatives of that State in Congress to vote
for a grant of aid to the central branch of the
Union Pacific railroad. I will state that pre-
vious to the reception of these resolutions I had
voted against the bill to grant the aid referred
to. It is due to the members of the Legislature
that I should say that I had taken my action on
the subject before I was aware of those resolu-
tions. I move that they lie on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
ItKPORTS OP COMMITTEES.
Mr. CONNESS. The Committee on Mines
and Mining, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. *770) to incorporate the National Gold
and Silver Mining Company of Washington,
District of Columbia, have instructed me to
report it back and asl; to be discharged from
the further consideration of the bill. The bill
proposes, I will state in brief, to establish a
corporation by a congressional act for the
purposes of mining in the Territory of Montana,
which Territory has an act of general incorpo-
ration of its own, under which companies for
those purposes may be organized; and the com-
mittee deem it, therefore, improper to recom-
mend the passage of an act for that purpose by
Congress.
The committee were discharged from the
further consideration of the bill.
Mr. WILLEY, from the Committee on
Claims, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 284) for the relief of N. A. Shuttleworth,
of Harrison county, West Virginia, reported it
without amendment.
Mr. VICKERS, from the Committee on
Railroads in the States, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 849) to incorporate the Na-
tional Railway Loan and Trust Company, asked
to be discharged from its further consideration,
and that it be referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia ; which was agreed to.
GEORGE W. LANE.
Mr. DAVIS. The Committee on Claims, to
whom was referred the joint resolution (H. R.
No. 219) for the relief of George W. Lane,
superintendent of the branch mint at Denver,
Colorado, and Assistant Treasurer of the Uni-
ted States, havehaditundereonsiderationand
directed me to report it back with a recom-
mendation that it pass; and as it is a bill of
very great and strong justice I should like to
have it considered now. It will take but a few
moments, I think.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
the unanimous consent of the Senate to con-
sider the joint resolution at this time.
Mr. DAVIS. Allow me to say a word in
explanation of the joint resolution. The peti-
tioner was the Assistant Treasurer and superin-
tendent of the mint at Colorado. His princi-
pal clerk stole something over thirty six thou-
sand dollars from the safe of the mint. Mr.
Lane went in pursuit of him to New Mexico,
and made a most remarkable, energetic, and
successful pursuit. He overtook him and
reclaimed, of the $36,000 over thirty-two thou-
sand dollars, and had the culprit brought back,
tried, convicted, and sentenced to the peniten-
tiary. He now asks that he be exonerated from
the payment of so much of the money as was
not reclaimedâ€”$4,419 90. A special agent
was sent by the Treasury Department to exam-
ine into the matter, and he recommends the
passage of the joint resolution.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution. It proposes to au-
thorize the Secretary of the Treasury to credit
and allow to George W. Lane, superintendent
of the United States branch mint at Denver,
Colorado Territory, in the settlement of his
accounts, the sum of $-1,419 90, public money,
which was stolen from the mint without fault
or neglect his part, and which has not been
recovered.
The joint resolution was reported to the
Senate without amendment, ordered to a third
reading, and read the third time.
Mr. SHERMAN. Is there a report in con-
nection with that joint resolution?
The PRESlDENTpm tempore. There is no
report.
Mr. DAVIS. The facts are all as I have
theua. It is a very strong and obvi-
