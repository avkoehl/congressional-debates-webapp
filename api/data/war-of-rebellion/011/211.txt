[JNumbers A. RAWLINS,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Farmington, May 24, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The regiments had best move out at once, as fast as they arrive, to my old camp, on Seven Mile Creek, 3 miles in rear of Farmington.

Can you tell me who is the senior officer with them and whether they have their transportation?

They had best move out rapidly, bringing ten day's rations, so as to clear the landing and the road for the others.

The enemy's pickets have almost disappeared from my front and have ceased to fire for twenty-four hours. There have been no drums beat on my left for the same period and no running of trains from Corinth.

I am sending out some companies of skirmishers and a couple of howitzers to-day on the road leading from my left to Corinth. You will therefore understand the cause of any artillery firing you may hear.

JNumbers POPE,Major-General, Commanding.

JNumbers POPE,
