MAY 22, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

All the disposition have been made as far as circumstances will admit, but they cover in spirit the commanding general's order. The enemy probably wanted our picket-line in front of General Ames and I think they must have taken it. It is probably restored by this time.
