Mi P. obsencd, that his whole object in sub-
mitting the motion was to insuie a vote upon the
bill at the piesrnt session He disliked to tax the
foibeaianct of the House, but the measure was
one ot such vital nitcicst to his constituents and
the whole wi stein count!y, that he felt compi lied
to saciidcc any scmplishe might feel on that head
to the demand of public duty He bi icily stated
that the bill was íeported at the bst session of
Congicss, but,like all others of the same natuie,
lcmanitd on the Cali ndar untouched. The object
of the bill was to enable theSerietary eif the Tieas-

Mi CHILTON said that the object of his
motion was pei haps misundei stood by the House
It proposed only an mquiiy, which the House
was in the practice of gianting to every gentle-
man The road fiom Louisville to Nashville,
was peihaps one of greater impoitance than any
othei west of the Alleghany mountains. A most
i extensive commeice was earned on between the
cities indicated in his lesolution, and this road
was one of the principal mail loutcs between
Washington Cityand NewOileans. Itwascon-
"nected with the national oi Cumbciland load,
and its improvement was a mattei of deep in-
teiest to the citizens of Kentucky and Tennessee.
In times of low water an immense pait of -the
ti ado of East Tennessee and the southern pal t of
Kentucky passed over the load m question
The pioposed inquiry involved noncwpimciple,
and he trusted that theie would be no objection
to it
The question was then taken, and the resolu-
tion was lejccted—yeas 72, nays 88
