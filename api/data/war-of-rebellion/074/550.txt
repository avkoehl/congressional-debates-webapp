ment the great and meritorious services rendered by General Leggett and Giles A. Smith in the transactions to which this relates. No officers were ever placed in more trying or difficult circumstances, and none could have displayed more courage, sound judgment, and skill in the management and direction of their respective commands, whose splendid fighting has not been excelled by that of any troops in the armies of the Republic.

The Seventeenth Army Corps maintained the fair renown it had won under its first commander, Major-General McPherson, the youthful and illustrious leader of the Army of the Tennessee, who, in this battle,laid down his unsullied life for the cause to which he had consecrated it. Yet his genius survived in the discipline, valor, and constancy with which he had inspired his veterans.

I recommended that the distinguished services of Brigadier Gens. M. D. Leggett and Giles A. Smith be recognized by the Government by conferring upon both of them the brevet rank of major-general, to be followed by promotion to that rank on the occurrence of the first vacancies. I am satisfied that such recognition is not only due to these officers, but that it will prove beneficial to the service.

I am under great obligations to the members of my staff, and especially to my adjutant-general, Lieutenant Colonel A. J. Alexander; inspector-general, Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson J. Hibbets, of the Thirty-second Ohio Volunteer Infantry,and First Lieutenant Logan Tompkins, Twenty-first Missouri Volunteer Infantry, acting aide-de-camp, for the courage, zeal and fidelity with which they assisted me on the field.

I am also under obligations to Lieutenant James R. Dunlap and Lieutenants Conard and Stickney for their gallant services in transmitting dispatches during the engagement,and when under heavy fire from the enemy. I call attention to the report of Lieutenant Dunlap, which is transmitted herewith.

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. and Army of the Tennessee.
