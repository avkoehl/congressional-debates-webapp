HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,Morehead City, N. C., January 1, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel D. T. VAN BUREN, Fortress Monroe:

COLONEL: I would respectfully report the arrival at this port of the steamer Cahawba, with the Eleventh Maine and Ninety-eighth New York. We found entering the harbor just before us the Kennebec, with the Eighty-first New York, and that the Belvidere had discharged the One hundredth New York. Off Hatteras we parted our hawser and left the ship Montebello. Soon thereafter the wind shifted to the west and afterward to the northwest, which will insure her prompt arrival. The two monitors behaved admirably, and although we had quite a heavy blow they stood it with no apparent difficulty. At daylight of the 31st, when we saw them last, the storm had abated and the indications were all very favorable.

I have to report to General Foster at 1 p. m.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

HENRY M. NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., January 1, 1863.

General VIELE, Norfolk:

I learn that a leading citizen of Norfolk has been trying to incite the soldiers of the Ninety-ninth New York to murder negroes. If there is such a feeling existing the procession which is to take place to-day must be watched and, if necessary, stopped, not only on account of the feeling referred to but for the security of the negroes themselves.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
