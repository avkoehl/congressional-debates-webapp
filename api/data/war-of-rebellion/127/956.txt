" The total amount appropriated for the purchase of arms and munitions of war was about $900,000. No appropriations were made for raising any volunteer forces, except for 2,000 men that it was supposed might be wanted for service in Charleston Harbor, and the Congress adjourned on the 16th of March to meet again on the [second Monday in May], unless sooner called together by the President's proclamation. War, though sometimes spoken of, was considered and improbable even by the large majority of the people, and the Congress by its adjournment manifested its conviction that no immediate hostilities were impending and that no necessity existed for further preparations for the public defense.
