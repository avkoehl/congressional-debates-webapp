HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT,

October 29, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters from Wise's brigade, of Johnson's division, came into General Miles' lines last evening. From them we learn that three brigades of Johnson's division (Ransom's, Gracie's, and Elliott's) moved on Thursday morning last to the right and took the position vacated by Mahone's division, which moved to the extreme right about 10 a. m. of the same day. Wise's brigade was left to hold the line originally occupied by Johnson's division. A rebel lieutenant from the Forty-sixth Virginia, Wise's brigade, came over to General Miles night before last. His statement corroborates the above. Johnson's division had not returned last evening. All the prisoners of war taken in the late engagement represent MacRae's and Cooke's brigade, of Heth's division, and Mahone's old and Wilcox's brigades, of Mahone's division. Information from City Point shows no movement of Pickett's, Field's, or Hoke's divisions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
