CITY POINT, February 25, 1865.

(Received 2.10 p. m.)

Major-General PARKE:

Deserters from General Ord's front to-day say that it is reported in their lines that Petersburg is being evacuated. Make every effort to ascertain if this report is true. The great number of deserters coming in on your front enables you, however, to know all movements of the enemy, I suppose.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 25, 1865-3.30 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

From deserters I learn that Rhodes' division moved west on South Sides Railroad on Wednesday, without artillery; that twenty-eight pieces of artillery left Petersburg for Chesterfield Depot; that ten carloads of chevaux-de-frise arrived in Petersburg over South Side Railroad last night. I have ordered General Potter to open on enemy's line in his front with his batteries.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 25, 1865-3.55 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

The two following dispatches just received.*

Owing to the fog and haze the signal officers have a very limited view. I have directed General Potter to open with the guns on the Ninth Corps front and report whether or not any response is elicited.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865-5.50 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

Deserters in from the rebel lines north of the James this afternoon still say that it is reported among them that Hill's corps has left,or is leaving,, to join Beauregard. Have you received deserters to-day from that corps? If such a movement is discovered we must endeavor to break a hole though some place in front of the Ninth Corps. Reserves from the Second, Fifth, and Sixth can be used to re-enforce the Ninth in such a move.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
