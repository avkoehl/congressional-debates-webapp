April 20, 1861, turned over by Captain W. Maynadier, commanding the Frankford Arsenal, to Colonel Charles Thomas, assistant quartermaster-general, Philadelphia, and that it is my opinion that gross neglect has occurred, which should, for the interests of the service, be inquired into.

Very respectfully, yours,

GEO. CADWALADER,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,Philadelphia, Pa., May 6, 1861.

I designed to have this matter examined into and the arms inspected by Captain Neill, but his own constant occupation and his now necessary absence have prevented. I now respectfully forward this, to add to my reasons given to-day and previously against moving this force till better equipped for the field. If empowered to draw arms, &amp;c., from the arsenal no moment shall be lost. The officers and men are anxious to move, but the former see and fell the responsibility, and know they should not move in their present condition.

Honorable John Sherman has been made acquainted with the wants and the feeling of a portion of the command, and I desire he may have a patient hearing. I was not aware till to-day that several of the regiments of this city are without arms. I ask and urge that this force be not moved till I put it in motion by my own orders, which will be at the earliest moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. PATTERSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Major General GEORGE CADWALADER:

GENERAL: It is my duty to report to you that the muskets issued to my command are entirely inefficient for service, most of them having either broken locks or holes through the barrels, bayonets not to fit the pieces, &c. I formally, but respectfully, protest against such a reception of arms, but deem it my duty to do so. Without enlarging upon
