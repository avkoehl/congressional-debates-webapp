HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-3.15 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch received. You can relieve Hancock's troops at once, if you can do so without observation by the enemy.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 31, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Our helpless wounded are still lying close to the enemy's line and they give them no help. There is no firing going on. Our men and the enemy are standing up on the parapets. They could help them if they would. The wounded seem to be mostly colored men who are writhing with their wounds in this almost insufferable sun, and I think the neglect of them must be intentional. I think we should open fire upon the enemy if he refuses to let us go and take care of these men.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-3.45 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch relative to the wounded lying close to the enemy's line is received. A communication to General Lee upon the subject of the wounded has been made by the major-general commanding, and an informal request concerning them authorized to be made of the immediate commander of the troops by the officer carrying the communication. As yet no reply has been received.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Can you not by strengthening your front line extend so as to cover the line from your present left to the redoubt on the Norfolk road? As soon as matters are settled I shall direct Major-General Burnside to extend his line and relieve Cutler, but I cannot relieve him to do it to-night, as I do not know in what condition either his force or his works are in. My object is to get Hancock's whole corps in reserve. He will put a division to-night into these works.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
