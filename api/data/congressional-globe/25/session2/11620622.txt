the countly Wj¡¡ be a death warrant to all the banks in the
coumry When all the bank's of the country are thus destroyed,
of course there will no longer be any paper cunency Then
wui be accomplished the end intended by this policy—the end
not avowed indeed, but hardly disguised, but whether intended
or not, that end will be accomplished namely, the destruction of
aN the paper currency of the country How will this affect ihe
business of the country"* Why, all that portion of the business
which has been created and sustained by the banking system
will fall with the system, as all that poition of the medium of
exchange, created by that system, will then be abstracted from
the business of the country and gone For the business of eve
ry country will adjust itself) and proportion itseif, to the me-
dium of exchange, of the standard commercial value, which it
possesses, and may command m business It is ¡>o m theoiy it
is found to be so in fact Go to what country you will, and > ou
find its businessconespondmg in amount to its amount of such
a medium
Now, what proportion of the business of the country has been
created and sustained by the banking system9 I have stated,
and I think not lets than nine parts in ten
In or 'ei to throw a discipciit iifonthe banking system, the
honoiable gentleman fiom S >uth Catohna, [Mi Calhoun',]
and the honorable fentltmao ¡rom Connect cut near me [Mr
ISiLE& ] have both t^M ns of the enormous dispiopoition be
tween he circulating ciedits of the banks, and the specie in
tht ir vaults the one a little 'e<*3 than fivehundied mil! or ", and
the «pecie not one tenth of that amount In this view oi the
subject, and with the>r view, the honoiable gentlemen have not
donejUbtice to their own argument For they might have
added the immense amount of bank cicdit= which never ap} ear
m circulation which appear only on the booí s oi the bank but
winch make a paitol bank ciedif*, and as much so as their
bills in circulation I meai the transfei ofciedi r.on the books
01 the bank founded on depositee, and these made up of dis
counts In all our great commercial citiea these transfeis pro
babiy exceed in amount the amount of bills m calculation
there While arraymgbefoie ue, and arraigning the sins of the
banking system, (which seems to consist m extending the bu&t
ness of the country ) these honoiable gentlemen might have
put another criminal charge into thur bill of indictment It is
this Tnat part ol the business of the countiy which is to be
placed to thecieditof the specie portion oí the currency is
more than doubled by means of the banks For, without
banks a great part of the specie of the countiy woul t be dead
stock lying idle in private coffers, and that portion of it m the
hands of business men w uld be idle much of the time, for it
must be accumulated bcfoiehand, and kept on hand to meet en
gasreme ts Cut with banks all the specie of the country is
kept in activity, constant activity WI en these honorab egen
tlemcn íevi'-e ana íepubiisn then criminal caiendai a «ain't the
banks, 11 ope they will not omit then to place the^e two of
fences m the criminal list Let them put all the bank crimes
together—their brlls in circulatior beyond their j e íe—then
trimsfei credits which aic not in cncuiation—the augmented
activity and operation given by them to specie, and I have no
doubt they will prove n ank= guilty of having created áñá
sustained at least nine paitsm ten of the whole busmen of
the countiy Tneir task, I admit, would have been still easiei
to make manifest this enormous guilt oí the banking system, 11
we still hada ivational Bank existing For then they mightadd
to the criminal account all that business which had been de
stroyed by destroying that bank Be ltiernembered, that hink
had been a gi eat offendei in thi* «tame ci immal business of ex
to idiot, the bu mebs of the countiy much gieater than the Jo
eal barks weie ir could be Foi that bank had not only given
to the countiy a nation a currency evuywleie of ¡he sanit uni
ioimvam* and that v due o) the ^¡tce Miniar1 but HI
thereby created a collateial curiei oy of ten tiiwt  (he amount
of its bills Foi it had convened eveiy inland bill of exchange
into currency, as much so a& tneir hank bills and tin  collate
ral < uirency had grownup to the enoimoua amount of six hun
died mil ions annually But by destioymg that bank yon, at
one siioke destioyed the whole system of inland Exchanges
This I look upon as the prnnaiy and great ciuse of all our
commercial difficulties andembanassments I know that theie
were other causes m other acts oi ihe Government out titile
we e but suboidmate causes, such as the lemovalor thedepo
s te* the instructions given to the ueposi e banks a& to the de
pc "lies, the specie cncular an 1 die mdi ci ct mode of ti tnQ j
íeinn* ti e surplus to the State but the gieat inotuei cau«e
was th< entire destruction oí the hole svsteir of inland
exchange4*
I shall not now dwell fui ther upon the 1 lea of the expansion

man Jiom Massachusetts [Mr Webstef J mhippplendid effoit
on jeoteiday and knowing as I do that all I could say on that
topic would but weaken the effect of what ha1- been bettei
said by him
To icturn then to the point I was upon will it b« said th"t
where nire paitb in ten of the enculatnff medium is abstracted
from the business ol the countrv specie will flow in to nil up
tl at nushty void and to sustain that bnsne*^ Mas1 the
specie of the country in te^d of bems augmented by that
event, will be dm inched by it greadvd mini hed foi doubt

banks Thou«n specie is said to be a fluid that will keep Us
level m the commercial vvoi d, (bv wh ch is n eant its ulative
commeicial valuc)yct though m ths seise it lb every where
at the same level, it is not e\ery vheie at the «ame depth
That depth depends upon and is measured by tht amount of
business of any giren eountry That amount is the true gauge
of that depth Why is the specie of England so great 1 cm
pancon with the specie of othet commeicial courtries'  Only
because her business is great m comparison with thtiis m the
same proportion
The country, then, is to be deprived of nine parís m ten of
her circulating medium She is to c mtent herself as ^he may

the process) from the star spangled banner, and let the meanest
in the troop of the barn door fowl, or the lowest of creeping
things, occupy his place, as the fittest emblem to represent the
humility of oui condition, and to tell the world of our fallen
pride and abdicated pretensions
But, if these-thmgs must he so, if jou will have them to be
so, why, let them be so Bu' I pray you to consider how, m the
mean white, you are fulfilling the high behest of the Constrtu
tion—which is to promote the general welfare -of the country
by the enlightened exeicise of your delegated powers, and to
look, for a moment, at the wide waste of the future, as well as

suieiáal policy
I have "aid that this policy would drable the country, enure
ly and forever, from developing her physical resources Xo
pioofof this now is necessary, all must see that the state of
things debciibed, and which must exist under this policy,
would make the thing impossible—would make tl^e attempt

Of our mineral riches, below the surface and buuedm the

m our coal regions, who womd undertake to calculate and de
fine its extent* The powei of number* would fail rum, and all
other powers, some new calculus must be invented and applied
to solve tl e pioblem
But, above all, and to crown all the^r, is our íesource in

our íesource^ indeed, wi hout them, the comparative vaiueof
all out other resources would be as nothing- contrasted to the
^aluewhich this would give them rheee improvements are
to sive concentration to aO these resources, and to bring them
all to beai with all their united influence, upon the growth ot

Thi1* sketch imperfect as it is will give us some niea of the
magnitude or rather of the infinitude, of our phy sical le^urces,
the i}e\ eloprnent of which is to be iorever abandoned under
this policy Look at England, and see what she has, ¿one for
herself, simply by developing her physical resources What
one of these tesources has she left undeveloped to the utmost?
What m the industry and ingenuity of her people? Whatm
her agncuhuiel What in her mineral riches? What in her
means of mechanical powerl And, above all, what m her m
ternal improvements? Not one And what thereby has she
done for herself, I ask agamí
She has thereby placed herself m jthe front tank of nations
foi wealth and power and made heise^ the first in that rank
She ha- thereby accumulated a capital that is a prodigy upon
the earth a capital that not only fill's up everv channel m every
