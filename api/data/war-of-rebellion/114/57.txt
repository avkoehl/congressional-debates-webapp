You are hereby instructed to give the orders heretofore received by you a liberal construction, and to arrest and seize all troops and stores of the United States, in transit or otherwise, wherever found in the State of Texas, and to use for that purpose all the means of this Government which you can made available in said State.

Honorable L. P. WALKER, Secretary of War, C. S. A.

SIR: The news by mail this morning indicates clearly that war exists between our Government and that of the United States. The commissioners of Texas agreed with General Twiggs that the U. S. troops then in Texas might pass out the State with their arms. At that time war did not exist; things have changed.

H. E. McCULLOCH,

Colonel, Commanding.

Lee's company of the Eighth U. S. Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant E. W. H. Read, of that regiment, and in the same of the Confederate States of America demanded the unconditional surrender of the company as prisoners of war. Mr. Read asked to be allowed to consult with his commanding officer (Colonel Waite) before making answer to my demand. To this, knowing that the colonel had no troops with which to re-enforce lieutenant's command, I agreed, and ordered Lieutenant French, of my company, to accompany him to Colonel Waite's quarters.

On his (Lieutenant Read's) return he complied with my demand to surrender, at the same time protesting against my action as being in
