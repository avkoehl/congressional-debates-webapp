• THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ability of the country. When we remove that
disturbing cause, importations, instead of going
on to increase at the rate of ten per cent, per an-
num, which is about three times as fast as our
population increases, will fall back to what they
were before these disturbing causes commenced.
To return, then, to the Secretary's figures; he
says that for the corresponding three quarters of
last year, the amount of merchandise imported
subject to duty was $210,000,000; to which he
adds ten per cent, ratio ofincrease—$21,000,000—
making the total amount that would be imported,
were there no disturbing cause, §231,000,000.
Now, he says, that the derangement in business
will probably cause a falling off of twenty-five
percent, in our imports; or in other words, I sup-
pose that he means, that by reason of hard times,
we shall get along with twenty-five percent, less
of articles of foreign merchandise than we other-
wise should, and makes the account stand thus:
There would liave been imported had there been no re-
vulsion  $231,000,000
Deduct, by reason of revulsion, twenty-five
per cent  57,750,000
Leaves  $173,250,000
Or, as the Secretary calls it, in round numbers,
$174,000,000. Upon that amount of dutiable im-
ports the Secretary estimates that the average duty
under the late tariffact will amount to about nine-
teen per cent., thus giving him, as a revenue from
customs for the three quarters ending June 30,
1858, $33,000,1)00. That thisestimate txerroneous
to the extent of $8,000,000 at least, I believe that
I can satisfy every candid mind that will give at-
tention.
The Secretary assumes that by reason of the
hard times, our falling off from the correspond-
ing quarters of last year will be fifteen per cent.;
that is to say, he first adds ten per cent, for the
natural increase in case there was no disturbing
cause, to the amount of last year, and then de-
ducts for derangement in business twenty-five
per cent.; leaving as his estimate eighty-five per
cent, of the imports of the corresponding quarters
of last year as the imports for this.
That this estimate is a very liberal one, I think
every one will admit. That "it is one that we can
safely trust, I do not believe. Is there a man in
this House who believes that, for the last three
quarters of this year, we shall buy eighty-five per
cent, in quantity abroad of sugar, molasses, iron,
cotton and woolen goods, and other aaticles, such
as we usually buy, as for the corresponding quar-
ters of last year? Hut, taking the Secretary's
figures, and allowing that we do purchase abroad
eighty-five per cent, in quantity, will it give the
revenue that he supposes? Clearly not. Why?
Because that eighty-five per cent, in quantity of
merchandise will, by reason of the greatly re-
duced prices, fall far below the $174,000,000 that
it would have cost last year.
It is well known that this revulsion has not con-
fined itself to this country, but has been felt with
equal, or greater, severity in England and on the
continent of Europe; and it is a somewhat remark-
able fact, that the seventy of the pressure has been
greatest in those places which had an exclusive
metallic currency. The effect of this revulsion
has been to reduce the price of nearly every arti-
cle we import from abroad from twenty-five to
fifty per cent. To be on the safe side, 1 will call
it twenty-five per cent.
Suppose, then, that you import eighty-five per
cent, in quantity, what will be the cost of that
quantity? Certainly not$174,000,000, but twenty-
live per cent, less than that, or only $130,000,000
in value, on which duties will be collected, allow-
ing that the tariff of 18o7 will give an average of
duties of nineteen per cent., as claimed, and you
have, the receipts from customs, §24,700,000,
instead of $33,000,000, being an overestimate from
customs alone of the moderate sum of $8,300,000.
It probably may be said that the Secretary, in
estimating our imports at eighty-five per cent, of
last year, did not refer to quantity of commodi-
ties, but their cost. If he means that, it is equiv-
alent to saying that we shall, during this year,
import a greater quantity of merchandise than
ever before—a statement that everybody knows
cannot be true.
. To narrow this question down to a point where
it will be apparent to the lowest comprehension,
I propose to take up the finance report, and invite
your attention to one or two leading articles from
which revenue is derived.
I will first call your attention to the articles of
sugar and molasses, which are objects of univer-
sal consumption. The amount of importations
of those two articles for the year ending June 30,
1857, were as follows:
Sugar SJ42,614,604
Molasses  8,359.175
Total.
850,873,779
On which a duty was paid of over fifteen mil-
lion dollars, orabout one fourth of all the revenue
from customs was received from that source for
the last year.
Now,I have shown ingeneral terms thattheSee-
retary had over-estimated fur this year, $8,300,000,
and now I shall show that that over-estimate may
be found in the articles of sugar and molasses
alone. The fact is known that there was a short
crop of sugar in Louisiana in 1856. Prom five
hundred thousand hogsheads, which it had been,
the product fell to less than one hundred thousand
hogsheads. Two consequences followed this fail-
ure of crop; first, a very large importation to
supply the deficiency; and, second, a great en-
hancement of prices, so that the \alue of the im-
portation, which was only about thiiteen million
dollars in 1855, in 1857 reached theenoimous sum
of over forty-two million dollars ! The cause that
produced that vast accession to our revenue last
year has ceased. The Louisiana crop is a good
one; add to that the further fact, that there are now
immense stocks of foreign sugar and molasses in
the warehouses of the principal cities, and you
will say that I am justified in declaring, that the
imports of sugar and molasses for the last three
quarters of this year, will not reach ill quantity
one half what they were for the corresponding pe-
riod last year. The price has fallen off about one
half.
For the last three quarters of last year you import-
ed about thirty-eight, million dollars of sugar and
molasses in value, on which a thirty per cent, duty
was paid, of about eleven million five hundred
thousand dollars. This year, during that period,
you may import one half the quantity, at one
fourth the cost of last year's importation; so that
your sugar and molasses of the three last quarters
of this year, instead of paying duty on $38,000,000
will pay duty on perhaps $10,000,000, at twenty-
lourpercent.,instead of thirty percent., aduty of
$2,400,000. Thus, on these articles alone, you
will sustain a falling off in revenue of $9,100,000, a
larger sum than I allowed in my general estimate,
as the falling off from all the articles of merchan-
dise that are entered for consumption. To carry
out my illustration still further, I might call atten-
tion to the article of railroad iron, which has here-
tofore been a large source of revenue; but, as I
have not time to more than advert to it, I pass
on.
Having shown a very large over-estimate on the
receipts from customs, I now propose to show a
much larger over-estimate, in proportion, from the
sales of the public lands. The estimate from that
source is put down by the Secretary, for the three
quarters, as $3,000,000; an estimate, in my opin-
ion, wholly unjustified by any state of existing
facts. It is web known that during the correspond-
ing quarters of last year, there was a great, and,
I may say, an unusual desire pervading the entire
community, to acquire public land. This desire,
the result ol easy credit and a redundant circula-
tion, did not confine itself to the new States, as
the members of this House from the old States
know.
Now, under this condition of great and unnat-
ural activity, what were the receipts into the Treas-
sury for that period from the public lands? Let
us see :
For the quarter ending December 31.1855 £80*,ar2 86
For the quarter enrhne March 31, 1857 1,065,640 11
For the quatter ending June 30, 1857 1,063,213 28
Total $2,937,100 25
With the above figures before him, and with
full knowledge in regard to the depression in busi-
ness that has affected all classes and conditions
of men, he tells us that he expccts to receive
$3,000,000, or $62,£03 75 more than for the cor-
responding period of last year.
This proposition of the Secretary only requires
1 to be stated for its absurdity to be apparent. My
judgment is, that the receipts from that source
will not exceed one half of what they were for the
same period last year, and shall accordingly put
down the receipts from sales of the public lands
at$l,500,000; receipts from customs, for the three
last quarters, $24,700,000; miscellaneous sources,
( $750,000; total, $26,950,000; which is $9,800,000
less than the Secretary estimates, and which, in-
j stead of leaving a surplus in the Teasury, at the
I end of the year, of $426,875 67, it will be left with
i a deficiency of $9,373,123 33.
| But, to press our examination a little further,
| we shall find that, to enable the Secretary to bring
I the Treasury to the close of the year, with the
meager balance of $426,875 67, he has postponed
the payment of existing appropriations for the ser-
vice of the present fiscal year to the year ending
June 30,1859, to theextent of$16,586,588 35; so
that, if these appropriations were expended within
the year for which they were made, there would
be a deficiency at the end of the year, taking the
Secretary's own high estimates, of $16,159,712 68;
to which add the sum of $9,800,000, which I have
shown should be deducted from these estimates,
and you have the real deficiency, on the 1st July
next, as $25,959,712 68.
To enable the Secretary to present the balance
he does at the close of the year, he not only post-
poned the large sum that I have before indicated;
but I think has under-estimated the expendituies
for the three last quarters of this year at least
$10,000,000. He estimates the expenditures for
that period at $51,248,530 04, but gives no details
by which to judge of the correctness of the esti-
mate ; and we can only judge them by the preceding
quarter ending September 30, 1858. The expend-
iture for that quarter, exclusive of what was paid
to redeem the public debt, was $21,703,745 81.
In view of what is transpiring on our frontier, it
cannot be wide of the mark to say that the expend-
itures cannot fall much short of what they were
the first quarter of the year for each of the three
last quarters. Here, then, is over ten millions
more to add to preceding deficiencies.
But I am not going to leave the Secretary here;
but propose briefly to examine ins estimates for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859. The Sec-
retary is-evidently a hopeful man. It is a happy
characteristic to be possessed of; but I submit to
the House that it is not a quality to be sought or
desired in the character of the man to whom is
intrusted the management of the finances of this
Government. The prudent and safe financier
always looks at the worst aspect that his affairs
present; and guaids and protects himself accord-
ingly. Not so our Secretary; but like a bankrupt
merchant, who fears to look at his books, and
face the state of facts there disclosed as they really
are, he blunders on,expecting" something to turn
up" to rescue him from impending ruin.
That I do the Secretary no injustice, in declar-
ing him to be of a too hopeful and visionary char-
| acter to be a safe counselor m the Department
| which he occupies, I think I have already shown;
' but if I have not, perhaps may do so before I close.
The coolest, best informed, and most calculating
men do not regard the late revulsion as a mere
passing shower, to be immediately followed by
balmy breezes and pleasant sunshine, but rather
as a terrible equinoctial storm, producing a great
upheaval in the ocean of business from its lowest
depths, and sweeping away with its mighty surges
that plant of slow growth, confidence—and with
it the whole superstructure of mercantile credit.
The wisest and most experienced among mercan-
tile men believe that it is a work of time to restore
that confidence, and rebuild thereon the structure
that 1 as been swept away. I know the courage
and recuperative energy of our people, which no
calamity has power to subdue. Indeed, like Gen-
eral Taylor, at Buena Vista, who did not know
when he was whipped, so a Yankee does not know
when he is broke. But with all our will, all our
courage, and all our energy to overcome difficul-
ties, we still want a little time. To ask us to
believe that in a year's tunc from now our impor-
tations are going to return to what they were one
year ago, with twenty per cent, added, is playing
the " confidence man" a little too strong.
The Secretary estimates the receipts into the
