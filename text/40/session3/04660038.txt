I have the satisfaction of stating that a
decree has been rendered in the high court
ot chancery of the Dominion of Canada, in the
''stamp case," (the United States vs. Boyd et
al.,) in favor of the plaintiffs. This action
was brought to recover United States postage
stamps of the value of about ten thousand five
hundred dollars, which had been stolen in
July, 1864, from the steamer Electric Spark,
conveying the United States mails from New
York to New Orleans, which was captured at
sea by the armed steamer Florida, a piratical
vessel sailing under rebel colors. The court
sustained the right of the United States to the
stamps, awarding costs of suit and ordering
the return of the stamps to this country. The
preparation of the case in this country was
chiefly conducted by Joseph A. Ware, esq.,
solicitor of the Auditor's office, who deserves
great credit for his diligence and skill, and
the case was prosecuted under the counsel and
direction of Hon. Caleb Cushing. The report
of the solicitor of the Auditor's office and the
opinion of the chancellor is published in the
appendix.
The subject of connecting the postal service
with the magnetic telegraph is one deserving
the special attention of Congress. An inde-
pendent report on the subject will be prepared
and submitted for consideration at an early day.
The rapid growth of the postal service of the
United States since the present organization
of the Post Office Department was established
by the act of July 2, 1836, has devolved on its
officers an amount of business of so extensive,
varied, and responsible a character that a
reorganization, wisely adapted to the present
and prospective condition of the service is
necessary to secure the greatest practicable
efficiency in its administration. 1 will take an
early opportunity to prepare and submit to
Congress for its approval a plan for its reor-
ganization.
Respectfully submitted:
ALEX. W. RANDALL,
Postmaster General.
The President.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Department of ihe Interior,
Washington, November 30, 1868.
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that
the reports received by this Department from
its bureau and other officers have, pursuant to
law, been transmitted to the Public Printer.
They furnish copious details touching the sev-^
eral branches of the public service to which
they relate.
During the last fiscal year public lands were
disposed of as follows :
Acres.
Cash sales  914.942.33
Located with military warrants  512.533 42
Token for homesteads 2,3.2S,923.23
Approved to States as swamp  259 197.85
Grants to rnilronds  697,257.57
Located with college scrip   1,942,889.08
6,655,742.50
a quantity less by 385,372 acres than that
disposed of the previous year.
The cash receipts of the office during the
same period, from all sources, amounted to
$1,632,745 90, which exceeds the amount re-
ceived from the same sources the previous
fiscal year by §284,883 38.
Nearly one fourth of the homestead entries
were made under the act of June 21, 1800,
which applies only to the States of Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida.
The quantity of laud still undisposed of is
1,405,366,678 acres.
Measureshave been taken for establishing the
boundary lines between Nebraska and Colo-
rado, Nebraska and Wyoming, Nevada, Utah,
and Arizona, and for running the northern
boundary of New Mexico.
I invite attention to the views presented in
my former reports in regard to certain amend-
ments of the preemption and homestead laws.
The report of the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office is very elaborate, and affords
much valuable and interesting information in
relation to the agricultural, mineral, and other
resources of the several land States and Terri-
tories, as well as many judicious suggestions
on the operation of the laws regulating the
disposal of the public domain.
Of the two revolutionary soldiers pensioned
by special acts of Congress in 1867, John Gray,
of Ohio, has died. The other, Daniel F. Bake-
man, of New York, is reported as living.
There are at the present time on the roils
the names of 888 widows of revolutionary sol-
diers, and 1,303 widows and children of sol-
diers who served in wars subsequent to the
Revolution and prior to the rebellion.
During the pasty ear there were examined and
allowed 9,325 new applications for invalid pen-
sions of soldiers, at an aggregate annual rate
of $628,271 70, and 4,854 applications for in-
creased pension ofinvnlid soldiers, at an annual
aggregate rate of $280,487 28. During the
same period 19,242 original pensions to widows,
orphans, and dependent, relatives of soldiers
were allowed, at an aggregate annual rate of
$1,910,202 70, and 27,053 applications by the
same class for increased pay were also ad-
mitted, at a total annual rate of $1,725,960.
On the 30th June, 1868, there were on the
rolls 74,782 invalid military pensioners, whose
yearly pensions amounted to $6,828,025 26,
and 92,243 widows, orphans, and dependent
relatives of soldiers whose yearly pensions
amounted to $12,065,068 94, making the total
aggregate of Army pensioners 167,025, at a
total annual rate of $18,893,094 20. The
whole amount paid during the last fiscal year to
invalid military pensioners was $7,484,796 85;
to widows, orphans, and dependent relatives,
$16,173,801 93; agrand total of$23,658,598 78,
which includes the expenses of the disbursing
agencies.
During the same year there were admitted
135 new applications for invalid Navy pen-
sions, at an annual rate of $12,890 ; 50 appli-
cations for increased pensions of the same class
at an annual aggregate of $2,994 ; 219 original
applications of widows, orphans, and depend-
ent relatives of those who died in the Navy, at
an aggregate rate of $26,012 per annum, and
72 pensions of the same class were increased
at a total yearly rate of $3,600. On the 30th
June, 1868, the rolls of the Navy pensioners
bore the names of 1.175 invalids, at an annual
aggregate of $94,833 75, and 1,443 widows,
orphans, and dependent relatives, at an aggre-
gate annual rate of $236,256. The amount
paid during the last fiscal year to Navy invalids
was $97,340, and to widows, orphans, and de-
pendent relatives of officers and seamen of
the Navy, $255,043 21; a total amount of
$3-52,383 21.
During the year there were added to the
number of pensioners of all classes 28,921,
there were dropped, from various causes,
14,752, leaving on the rolls, June 30, 1868,
169,643. The total amount paid for pensions
of all classes, including the expenses of dis-
buisement, was $24,010,981 99, a sum greater
by $5,391,025 53 than that paid the previous
year.
There were 1,077 bounty-land warrants issued
for 167,720 acres.
The expenditures for special agencies are
largely exceeded by the pecuniary gain to the
Government. Over 300 claims have thus been
found fraudulent, amounting to"$27,000 per
annum.
The Commissioner presents in his able report
valuable suggestions touching the codification
and administration of the pension laws, and
other matters relating to the office, to which I
respectfully invite attention.
