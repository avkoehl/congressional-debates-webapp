view, he triumphantly asks if I woald be vu lmg to
change our naturalization laws by rendering a re-
sidence on our vacant lands equivalent to tne de-
claration of intention which these laws require'
Now, I ask him in return, have I ever said that I
would? Have I ever lutinaled any s,uch inten-
tion? On the contrary, have I not expressly d«-
clared that I would not grant to any foreigner the
elective franchise until he had become a natural-
ized citizen under our lams'2 Whilst ¡should not,
with the Senator from Kentucky, deny to the fo-
reigner the right of the pre empt'on wh ch he has
fairly acquired by the dangers and privations en
countered in making a settlement on your remote
front.er, I would not, for this reacan, confer upon
him the high poht cal prn lieges of an "Vmencan
citizen The Senator'-, argument, therefore, m
this particular, falls to the ground It has no
foundation, i^ any thing wh ch I said, to lest upor-
The right of pre-emp'ion is one thing, bat the h gh
privilege oí becoming an American citizen is ano-
ther and entirely different matter
And what, after all, is this great privilege of pie-
emption' To what does it amount' What )■> i s
intrinsic value' It is merely a centcst oetween the
speculator and the actual sUder, as to whether the
former shall be permitted to purchase the spo s of
land improved and rendered valuable by tin toil of
the latter Our experience has ccmoustrattd that
the average excess of the pr ce of the puVtc lands
advertised and sold at public sile, in pursuance of
the President'  proclamation, is not more than two
or three cents per acre above the fixed price of the
Government at private sale
What, then, is the privilege granted to t >e set-
tler who goes into the w ld'rness, clears away the
forest, and there estab'ishes h s homt' Does this
bill offer such a man a donation' Not at all Dm s
it give him the land as a bounty' No such thing
The privilege it confers is mat I e sha'l n^t be
driven from his humb e borne oy tne speoula'or
This mighty pnvih ge is that he shall pay lor h s
land ths price fixed by law, wmch may be less, by
two or three cents per acre, th-1  it would comTand
at public «a'e, and that after be ha  ¡riid for it, he
shall hold it And why, at th s hi'e day, for ih 
first time in your history, should joa make an
odious distinction, in this '■mall mauer, It tv een the
settler, who had drawn his first breath on the other
side oí the Atlant c, and the American ci izen' No
such distinction had ever existed hue ofore, and
no complaint had ever been t ttcied by those d -
rectly interested, ihat [his trill np privilege had bee i
conferred upon foreigners If the Senator bit'
carefully read the history of his country—I mean
on this par icular point—1 my elf have not, but
the fact has bf en furnished to me by one who has -
what would he ha^e found in relation to these n w
despised foreigner.*'
[Hire Mr Crittenden denied that he had spo-
ken of them as "despised ioreigners ' ]
Mr Buchanan said I know he han  no', bu' if he
had understood the honorable Senatoi correct!;, he
had spoken with mdianation rgamst using the bo-
dies of fore gners as a barrier on oui frontiers
against the incursions of the «avage fie, a dcon-
sidered it a degradation to our own pit ?=rs to in-
voke the aid of such defender', I the Senaioi
had read the history of h s counny, he would have
found that the Revolutiona'V C ingress, "in the
times that tried men\ souis," bad invited tbo e fo-
reigners to enlist undei our b-nners, and had
offered them not a mtie pre-emption light,
but a bounty in lands, with the pnvi'ege of
at once becoming American citizens Hete Mr
B read the acts of Congress of Augu t 14 h, . n 1
August 27, 1776 from the fi'st volume and fust
page of the land laws These acts manifested the
estimation in which foreignets, who were wil'm" u>
fight in the cause of mdependerce, weie at that
day held by the Revolut'onarv Congress He cru d
not be mis alter* m believing that it was far differ-
ent from the estimate now placed upon them by
the Senator from Ken'ucky Now, sül Mr B I
desire to make no política! capital out of any
question of this nature I wish c nly to act towards
those foreigners who may have -ettled cr shall set-
tle upon our public lands, upon the pr nciples of
eternal and immutable justice     Nothing more
From the beginnmr it has been our policy to per-
mit foieigners to purchase and settle upon the pub-
lic lands, arid 1 shall not now, for the first time,
SMaolr-h an odious distinction against them, m a
pre-emption bill I will not now, at 'his late day,
repeal the establr=he 1 policy of the c< untry, but in
this particu ar shall pursue the system adop'ed by
tne wisdom of our predecessors.
But the Senator has aske 1 me why I ara so wil-
ling to accord the«e priiileg^s, and yet am 'So
jealous of f' r .gners holding a little stock in a pe1-
ty little bank " This question I shall endeavor to

T hese are not the men who fly from povertv and

Of such a foreign influence I confess that I am

The Senator had «aid, and he appeared to place

Mr CRITTENDEN said of course it must be
naiuril for him to desire to escape as s-oon as he
could from any contest with the Senator from
Pennsylvania, u was one in which of course he
cou'd hope to gam but little Yet he did not ad-
m t it to have been such very bad logic that he
should have imputed to him the sentiment of pre-
ferring a settlement on the public lands to a written
declaration before a magistrate as a test on the
part of a foreigner of an intention to become
an American citizen True, it was not said in
teims that he proposed so to altei the law, but the
S -na'or certainly did insist that the one act afiord-
ej bettei e/idence than the other, and if so, why
not substitute the one for the other' The Senator
svcul 1 not, of course, oppose the obtaining of the best
evi en , and as he esteemed the eutting down of
some trc « on the public lands, and the erection of
a log cabin, that thereby a pre-emption right might
be obtained, as better evid<-ne<- of Amencani«.m
than all the form- which our naturalization could
furnish, why should not the weaker evidence be
disp'-'n^ed with, and the stronger established' That
the difference bf tween the Senator and himself was
s mply this- the Senator was willing to put the
foreigner who made no declara1 on or a purpose to
be naturalized on the same footing with one who
did—on thefsame foot ng with one who had actual-
ly become naturalize 1, and even with the native-
born citizen He (Mr. Critteitden) did not. He
wa  ready to give to a foreigner who should be-
come a oti¿en, aceording to law, all the rights and
immunities of one born in the land He would
allow to one who hal siemfud hii intention to be-
rom'- «uch, greater con lleiation than to one who
hal not Tne S nstor was for g vmg e\ery thing
to a fo eipner who Had nmd< no such declaration.

invite them here that they might protect us Oh,
no, this was not the bulwark on which he would
re'y for protection We had other and stronger
c'tfinee to rely on, and not until we were reduced
o ihe last extremity would he consent to tell the
woihl that v,e looked to foreign aid as the bulwark
or our -afety The Senator was ot opinion that
our p otection against foreigner  getting poises-ion
if t e comtry bejond ihe Rocky Mountains was

rjb-egtntleman cell hi a that all that country was

po ed that in >e regions were covered by even the
vaguest lniwn tale We had heard of some en-
tire tr bes being exteimmated by di-^ase and ether
can es, and certainly the whole country was not oc-
cupied by Indians The gentleman, however, ima-
gined Indians to be our bulvaik against foreigner ,

ers the right of pre emp ion
