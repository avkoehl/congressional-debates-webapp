CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
have the naval appropriation bill brought up, and the Com
mittee on Manufactures did not feel at liberty to press the con-
sideration of the revenue bill, after the statement which had
been made by tha' gentleman in relalwn to the condition of the
appropriation funds for the atmyani navy They had been
assured that in all probability, those bills would occupy only
three, four, or five days
He (Mr S )had the means personally of knowing the situa
tlon of the Navy Depaitment He had in his possession (Mr
S was understood to say) a draft for $5 0C0, at thirty days,
drawn on account of the E*cpl irmg Expedition in behalf oí a
citizen of Bonor, which ran to malu-ity on the 21 of the
month, now lying over I had not been protested, because the
citizen who held it had not been «villing to protest it 1 his was
the state of the naval fund, ai d money wis due from that
department, not only to out own, but fort lgn citizens
Mr S was understood, howevei to pie !ge himself that, so
soon as the present bill was deposed of, he would call up
his bill, and 11 state that if the House was to wait until the
Committtee of Ways and Means mad a report, (provided
that comuntn-e were to go into the sulject m detail) they
would have to wait un ü the end of the session unless it was
to be protracted to a duration which no man could anticipate
The discussion then again came back to the naval appropna
tion bill
Mr MARK A COOPER of Georgia rose and said he did
not intend to discuss this raiticu ar motion but desired to reply
to a remark of the gentleman from Vngmia, [Mr Wise] He
was understood to say, that ' if the gentleman from Georgia
would be as attentive to the m'erests of the South as the mem
bersfrom theNoithare to theirs, they would not be found op
posing this measure, so in erestmgto the whole feouth "
[Mr Wise tose here to exp! un, saymghe did not intend to
impugn the conduct of the members from Georgia, but said, if
they would attend to this subject as vigilantly as tfie Noi them
gentleman do, they would perteive the interest the South has
in this matter ]
Mr C said the explanation had not ma eually modified the
remark, as he understood it It was evidently intended to compli
ment the Northe-n membersa the expense of thos" from Geor
gia, m particular It imputes negligence or imbecility t0 them
Mr C saidhehadfeUtheinjusticeoItr-isremark andhadwaited,
hoping that some co'leigne otitis who was his/ir-ecietessor,
would repel it Seeing nore Use to it he could not permit the
question to be taken w ithout a' leatt, replying to it For himself,
he would not contend that he had brought to his aid all the in
telligence demanded as a Renresentattve of Georgia, but he felt
it due to say he had not been wanting m ligilance on the sub
ject now befóle us lie hid looked to thi>, and all the appro
prtallon bills and, le t the g r tleman from Virginia should
think mote me inly or his intelligence than he would like him
to do, he would now state briefly the grounds on which he
would oppose the laige iva °ase of expenditures heie pro
pos-d
This bill is a large item in a Ia>ge account of increased ex
penditures now coming on tne country This account he prom
ised, at a future day, to set m order before this House if Prov i
dence, time, and opportunity should permit He woull also
set down what seeued to him the whys and whereforpswe
are to be disappointed m our anticipations of retrenchment
A large navy and large army oi either, is the argurnentand
justification for increased expenditures and large revenue
Theseare inconsistent with economy, or republican simplicity,
If not enemies to our very existence as airee people
In the establishment and pre«etvatlon of those pure and eco
nomical principleoof a republic, the people of Georgia had a
greater inteiest than in the establishment of a naval depot at
any pomtonour coast This naialdcpol, it seems, isshadowed
forth as the consideration of interest, the "quid pro quo" tendered
to Georgia nember&to recede ft oma'l their notions of economy
and retrenchment Sir, it has always been the case here, that
if you wou'd inducemembets to violate promisesnr theirprln
cio'es, ysa shoild ofer a "quid pro quo" to their people-
some present pecumaiy interest And it their Representatives
should nut acquiesce, they aie denounced as unfai hful, igno
rant of their constituents' mleresti, or wilfully negligent It
hart so hippened with himself last Congress, that, in a certain
bill, making certain appropnationsforirc'etrcra? impiovements,
an item giving a small sum to Savannah river via* inserted,
possibly to catch Georgias net constructionists For tie rea
sonsthatnow govern m , I(t,ai 1 Mr C ) voted no It so hap
pened that at the next e ecnon some of the people of Georgia—
who, prohahlv dd nit or could not appreciate the Inch
grounds he had acted m—made opposition to him, and assigned
this vote as one ground
Sn, weil iheSnteofGooigiado not envy the North the ad
vantage they have in tl e d stribntionsof navy and army offices,
and perquisites suchasnavy yards,ciistom houses lighthouses,
docks, aid foitificalions All this they can have, and more

engrossed, without making provision, by substituting a grjnt
in land instead of the sci ip M 8 mov ed to recon ider the
vote on the engrossment with a view to remedy the neglect
Mr KING thought there was no necessity for the amendment,
bel eving that the ¿ineral bill made ample provision
Messrs CALHOUN and SEVIER took pretty much the same
view
The bill, on the engrossment, was, however, reconsidered
Mr SEVIER moved to strike outall the bi 1 after the enacting
clause, and to insert the general bul on the table, covering all
such cases
Messrs SMITH, I INN KING, TAPPAN, and GRAHAM,
opposed this, thinking it better to pass the special cases   and

of midshipmen, and othet offices m the navy, according to the
ratio of federal population
Mr GAMBLE objected to the resolution He said from somo
of the Territories no applications had been made, and there-
fore the law, if such a one shouid ne passed, could not be en
forced
Mr. EVERETT said the gentleman was certainly mistaken.
Mt GAMBLE replied that the Secretaiyinhls report cer-
tainly said so
The resolution was then adopted
Mt   H DODGE submitted the following resolution
Whereas, by tiie act of Congress approved April 20, 1836,
entitled "An act establishing the tentorial government of
Wisconsin,' it was provided that 820 OOO te given to the said
Territory, which shall be applied by ihe Governor and Legisla-
tive Assembly to defray the expenses of erecting public building 
at the seat of Government, and, by the act of Congress, ap-
proved lune 18,1838, the runner sum of $20000 was appro-
priated to defray the expenses of completing the public build-
ings aforesaid And whereas the «40 000, so appropriated bjr
Congress, was paid to lames D Doty, as treasurer of a board
of commissioners, appointed by the Legislature of the Terri-
tory'o superintend the erection of the said public buildings,
who has d nied all authority, on the part of the Territory, to
lequirehim (the said Doty) to account to the Slid Tetritory
fir t ie unexpended pt mon of the money so appiopnated by
Congress, and claims to be accountable only to the Treasury of
the Unned Stales with which he pretends to have settled for
sail monev, and to have deposited a balance    Now, there-
Resolved, That the «ectetary of the Treasury he directed
to communicate to the House of Representatives all the infor-
mation m his pospessioo touching the payment to Iames~i>
Dotyol thes-nlsumof 64OO0O audits ex|endlture, showing
whether sud eum was chaigeable to, or was charged to, the
Territory of Wisconsin, or to James D Doty, whether said
Doty was acenuntible for said m ney to the United States, or;
to said Territory and if to the lormer, then that the said Secre-
tary communicate to ihe House all settlements which, at any
time, may have been made with said Duly, relating to the ex-
pendttureof saidS40C00, or any pan thereof, together wnh
certified copies of all vouchers, or othei papers, in anywise
connected with such settlements
Mr J C CLARK said there appeare 1 to be some figure 
in the preamble, and the resolution appeared to be a long one;
and therefore he hoped ihe gentleman would let it he on tha
table for examination, otherwise injustice might be done to
Mr Doty I f the g ntleman would not consent to this, he hoped
the preamble would be stricken out
Mr DODGF considered tms inquiry an act of justice to botrt
the Territory of Wisconsin and to the United States The in-
dividual alluded to had been employed to disburse public
money------                                                 , ,         .

it would lie over

tion

were ordered and resulted as follows   ayes 113, noes 17
Mr BOAÜDM4N moved tosnikeout the preamble
Mr aRNOI D said some gentlemen obiecled to it because lt
was supposed to make thaige  against Goveinor Doty, if so,
he hoped it *oul Ite modified
Mr HOWARD suggested, as an amendment, to strike out
the last recital It com lined a statement, ol the truth of which
he had no knowledge himself, and which was not then befoie.
the Houpe Without that reel al, he would vote for the res-
olution with pleasuie, but he must «ay there was great lm-
piopnety ill r akmg charges of embezzlement of the public
