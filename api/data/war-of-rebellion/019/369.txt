Brigadier General W. SCOTT KETCHUM,

Acting Inspector-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: My forces are now located at convenient distances between this point and Jacksonport. Some of General Steele's commend had arrived there on the morning of the 4th, but I have no report as yet from General Steele, who must be near. I am erecting a rope ferry for crossing this river here, and have similar direction at Jacksonport, so the White and Black Rivers may be no inconvenience to our movements. I have sent a scout through to Memphis to ascertain the possibility of approaching the Mississippi by that direct route, but the flood is said to be unlimited and the way almost or altogether impassable. There are some Texas troops in and beyond Little Rock, but nothing important on this side. Your dispatch of the 2nd was no doubt a response to mine from vera Cruz.

I shall try to carry out the design, but must again be delayed for supplies, which I have run away from. I find the Union sentiment in the country strong and in town considerable. I have started the mills, and grinding all the corn and wheat I can. The people of Arkansas are much more ready to abandon a desperate and despicable cause than some I have had to contend with. They seem rather cheered by the arrival of their ancient and time-honored flag.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
