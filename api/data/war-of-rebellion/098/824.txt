to cross that creek if he could and there to await further orders, while the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers, Thirty-third Massachusetts Volunteers, and One hundred and second Illinois Volunteers, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Buckingham, Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers, were ordered to proceed to Taylor's Hole Creek, on the Raleigh road, if possible. I proceeded with this latter column about four miles, and the enemy was met first at Evon's Creek. In a few moments, however, and after slight dispositions on our part, he left. The creek was crossed, and everything progressing favorably for some two miles beyond. I directed Colonel Buckingham to keep moving on carefully and to gain Taylor's Hole Creek if he could do so with his skirmish line, but not to engage his line of battle. (For a fuller and more particular report of this most satisfactory reconnaissance on the part of Colonel Buckingham I refer you to his inclosed report. *) Then taking a by-road through woods I joined the column with Colonel Hurst at Great Creek. No opposition as yet had been met. Leaving four companies of the Twenty-sixth Wisconsin, Major Lackner commanding, to hold a main road on my left, I took the nearest road to Black or South River, and proceeded three miles to within a few hundred rods of that river without opposition, here deploying five companies of the Fifty-fifth Ohio as skirmishers. I advanced them to the river bank, driving the enemy's cavalry across that place and engaging his skirmishers in a hot fire for twenty minutes. Having observed the river and calling forth artillery fire from four different pieces, the skirmishers were withdrawn and the column moved back to its camps, having marched a distance of from twenty-one to twenty-two miles. In the engagement the casualties were 1 slightly, 1 mortally, wounded in Fifty-fifth Ohio. March 15, moved (unencumbered) on the Raleigh road; crossed Silver Run and Taylor's Hole Creek and encamped at the latter place.

March 16, moved at 6. 30 a. m. over difficult and muddy roads forward some two or three miles on same road where the cavalry advance had been checked by the enemy, forming two lines, three regiments in each line, as per order, left resting on road and on the right of Second Brigade of this division, right resting on left of First Brigade of this division. Advanced in this formation a short distance, when the line halted and this brigade was ordered forward to relieve the Second Brigade, First Division, of this corps, Colonel William Hawley commanding, whose skirmish line had been engaged some time. In order to relieve Colonel Hawley I found it necessary to place all of my six regiments on the first line. This being done, the line was advanced about 250 yards to Colonel Hawley's position, the center of which was on our main road in the vicinity of Smith's house, or Smithville, and, relieving his line, immediately relieved his skirmishers with a strong, one from this brigade under command of Captain Graves, Thirty-third Massachusetts Infantry. The brigade remained in this position about one hour. On the skirmish line, meanwhile, continual firing was going on. Then, pursuant to an order from Brevet Major-General Williams, commanding corps, which order I immediately communicated to the division commander, I advanced both my skirmish and main line and occupied a slight line of breast-works of the enemy's, he, at the same time, retiring from my front. In advance of here a continual and sharp skirmish fire was kept. I had meanwhile doubled my line of skirmishers and the number of the line was 360 men. After several
