Brigadier-General CULLUM, Cairo:

All troops at Smithland or on the Ohio River should come to Paducah or Cairo, as you may deem best. I have authority of Secretary of War for this. If necessary, countermand, in the name of Secretary of War, all orders issued by General Buell or any one else about the troops halting or returning to Kentucky.

Major General DAVID HUNTER,

Commanding Department of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth:

To you more than to any other man out of this department are we indebted for our success at Fort Donelson. In my strait for troops to re-enforce General Grant I appealed to you. You responded nobly and generously, placing your forces at my disposition. This enabled us to win the victory. Receive my most heartfelt thanks.

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., February 19, 1862-4 p.m.

General McCLELLAN:

Yours of the 14th just received. Hitchcock will take command here as soon as he gets his orders. I think Hunter will consent to go under me and command the central column. If not, leave him where he is. It was decided in the Mexican, war that regulars ranked volunteers, without regard to dates. This decision, if sustained makes everything right for the Western Division. Give it to me, and I will split secession in twain in one month.

H. W. HALLECK,.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., February 19, 1862

General McCLELLAN:

Columbus has been strongly re-enforced from New Orleans. They have steam up on all their boats ready for a move-probably on Cairo.
