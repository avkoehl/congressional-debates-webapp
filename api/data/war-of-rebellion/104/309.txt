The following information has just been sent to me by Major Steele, my aide-de-camp, who accompanied Colonel Kirby:

Prisoners and deserters from the rebel army reported to me while at Warm Springs, N. C., that General Stoneman passed through Walkersborough on the 30th of March, and struck the Morganton railroad, near Statesville, destroying the railroad toward Salisbury; crossed the railroad south of Salisbury, near China Creek, and was advancing on Salisbury, tearing up the railroad, on 2nd of April. They also report Colonel Thomas' Legion, consisting of 800 infantry, 400 Indians, 1 four-gun battery with 150 men, and about 450 cavalry stationed at Quallatown, N.
