happy to be able to relieve you anxiety by informing you that the defeat of the enemy on the 7th instant and his subsequent hasty retreat from this vicinity permits me to release your battalion from further duty here at present. I have in consequence given orders to that effect.

I beg you, major, to accept for yourself and the gentlemen under your orders my sincere thanks for their prompt and patriotic response to my call for assistance in the defense of this city. I hope if we are ever threatened anew by the same dangers that you will again come to the rescue.

Your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 16, 1863.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy's monitors reported in Port Royal; his land forces reported leaving Cole's and Seabrook Islands; have ordered back to Wilmington part of Evans' brigade already here. Will soon return to Savannah, troops from there which may be required there before long.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

French consul and vice-consul have returned per steamer Calmut. English steamer Rinaldo is also outside. Both draw too much water to come in.

Messrs. ORR and BARNWELL,

Confederate States Senators, Richmond, Va.:

Cannot iron-plating be obtained for finishing Lee's torpedo ram, now nearly completed? It is far superior to any gunboat for attacking iron-clads. I regret cannot convince War and Navy Departments of that fact. Enemy appear to be returning to Port Royal.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 17, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond, Va.:

Generals Evans and Clingman desire that their brigades exchange stations. Evans thinks can best recruit his regiments by the transfer. Clingman proposes to send back to Wilmington one of his regiments instead of one of Evans', now here, about to be ordered to Wilmington. Can I do it?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
