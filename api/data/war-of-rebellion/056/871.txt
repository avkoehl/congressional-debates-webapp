General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have just read the letter of the honorable Secretary of War giving to General Vaughn authority to mount his brigade for service for the war.

I would respectfully suggest that we have already more cavalry than we need, and not enough of infantry. Besides, our country is completely overrun by cavalry; farms destroyed and forage and subsistence consumed and wasted to such and extend that I am apprehensive that we shall not be able to get along. Partisan cavalry, having authority to keep and sell everything that they capture, do not always confine their captures to the enemy's side. Horses, mules, cattle, and, in some instances, negroes are taken and sent south and sold. The other cavalry seems to have taken the up the idea that they should enjoy like privileges, and frequently take property captured from the enemy and from our own citizens and dispose of it to their own advantage.

I fear that this feeling to acquire property is more at heart with much of our cavalry than a disposition to drive the enemy from our soil.

I would suggest, therefore, that all partisan cavalry be made regular cavalry by law, if they so elect. Failing in this choice, it would be well to disband all such organizations and left the men be subject to conscription. In this connection, I would also suggest that no other soldiers be enlisted in the cavalry, as that arm is already full enough. Many, if not all of the troops, that are in service for three years or the war, think that they go out of service at the end of the three years, and are proposing to reorganize upon condition that they can have forty days' furlough. If they cannot have that furloughs,
