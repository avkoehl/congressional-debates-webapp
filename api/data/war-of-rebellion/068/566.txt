HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 9, 1864-11.45 a.m.

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Being satisfied that the enemy have left my right and front, I am about starting my First Division down the Spotsylvania road to connect with General Gibbon, who is, I understand, connecting with General Warren. I have sent out 2 miles to my front on the Catharpin road, where I met a squadron of enemy's cavalry at the junction of a cross-road leading to the left.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 9, 1864-12 m. [Received 12.15 p.m.]

General HANCOCK:

The major-general commanding wishes you to move your corps toward the Fifth Corps and as far as the point indicated by Lieutenant-Colonel Comstock, which is the white house where General Gibbon's right now rests. You will leave a division with a suitable amount of artillery to hold the cross-roads at Todd's Tavern, keeping up your communication with Gibbon and the division left at Todd's Tavern. All this presupposes that the enemy are not in great force in your front, and are not threatening you at Todd's Tavern. All information here leads to the belief that they are passing to our left and you will be needed here.

By command of Major-General Meade:

CHAS. E. PEASE,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 9, 1864-12.10 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

SIR: What shall I do with the heavy artillery of Colonel Burton? Shall I leave it here or take it along? My troops are moving. General Mott will be left in charge at Todd's Tavern; General Barlow on the right of Gibbon; General Birney on the extreme right, with the heavy artillery in reserve, as I place them with reference to Gibbon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 9, 1864- 1 p.m. [Received 1.15 p.m.]

[General HANCOCK:]

I think you had better leave the heavy artillery with Mott, as they will be nearer to Piney Branch Church, unless there is a road from Birney's to that place. The Artillery Reserve which they guard is at Piney Branch Church.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
