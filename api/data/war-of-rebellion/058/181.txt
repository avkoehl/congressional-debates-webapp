It is impossible to do so unless the bridge is finished early in the morning. It that is done by to-morrow night I can put everything at La Grange.

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General J. M. TUTTLE,

La Grange, Miss.:

GENERAL: As soon as Stevenson gets his men and material across the Big Muddy you will commence moving your force down, calling in all east of La Grange to that point by rail or by land.

I have added to your division the Thirty-third Missouri, now at Helena - a good regiment, with good officers. it will be well for you to send one of your staff to go to Helena in advance and see that the regiment is all right for the field. I strongly desire that your command, as old troops, move rapidly and neatly.

Yours,

S. A. HURLBUT,

As soon as the boats arrive you will embark without delay and proceed to Hayne's Bluff, on the Yazoo River, where yo will disembark and place your men in camp in good defensive position, and send one or more of the boats,as may be necessary, to Milliken's Bend to bring off Colonel Ballinger's regiment and the balance of your command, should any portion be left at Goodrich's Landing. Haynes' Bluff will be your station for the present, and as soon as you get into position you will proceed to make your command as comfortable as circumstances will admit.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
