Brigadier-General FISK,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

What have you from Boone and adjoining county? The Fanny Ogden, with 100 men, will be at Glasgow to-night to co-operate with your forces.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MACON, MO., September 9, 1864. (Received 10th.)

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I go over the North Missouri line to-day, stopping at Mexico and Warrenton. The troops are all moving, and I hope to give you a good report.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MEXICO, September 9, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The troops are all on the move. Have had two small fights with the guerrillas. Have captured a part of the horses stolen from freight train at Centralia. I go to Warrenton to-night. The telegraph line has been badly damaged between Renick and Allen. I shall put it in working order to-morrow morning. Dispatches to and from your headquarters have been delayed in consequence of the break. Colonel Wilber received his arms this morning. He will muster six companies to-morrow morning. Shall send him into the brush immediately. Nearly all the citizens of this and surrounding counties are either bushwhacking or aiding in this work of humanity.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 9, 1864.

General FISK:

Major King left Glasgow on the night of the 8th instant. He encamped same night about eighth miles northeast on the Chariton. Last night he encamped at Roanoke, twelve miles form here. He was to be at Fayette at 1 o'clock to-day. We have not been able to co-operate with him on account of a demand for a heavy escort to repair telegraph lines both east and south of this place.

CHARLES PARKER,

Captain, Commanding Post.
