CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                            777
oí the bill mating appropriations for the support
of the navy during the year 1842.
The pending question was the amendment of the
Senate increasing the first item (for pay, &c ) from
$2,335,000 to $2,800,000.
Mr. CARUTHERS, who was entitled to the
floor, addressed the committee m oppos.tion to the
amendment of the Senate He said he was unable
to perceive any reason why the defrmmat on of
the House should be changed He did not rai'e
the question of power between the two Houses but
thought tne judgment of the House was entitled lo
more weight in a natter of expense than the judg-
ment of the Senate, He replied to (he arguments
of the gentleman from Massachu etts [Mr Cosh
ma] m favor of ihe large appropna ions, and .vent
into a history of the increase oí the navy and its
officers for some years pas'. He conten led thnt
our circumstances did not call for a great navv
like that ef Great Britain, and that the splendid
theories and scheme of the Secretary of the Navy
would not be sustained by public opinion in ihe
esuntry.
After showing that so large a naval fo-ce was
not required for this coun'ry, he objee'ed, a j, bi-
' cause this appropriation provided for men on leave
or furlough, or men "wai ing orders," tor year  at
a time, at an annual cost to ihe nat on of s-veral
hundred thousand dollars. One principle or a re-
public should be, to "nave no s.necures." It was
unjust to the pe pie, by whom the salaries were
paw, to disburse such large amounts for no ser
vices rendered.
Mr. KING deeme 1 it a sic policy to have a
war establishment of officers aiwa ■  on hand, for
it required many years 10 rmke an other, and
they could not be provided on an emergency
What, he asked, would be the present rumocr if
officer , if a war «hot, d ccur? He a'so urged
the necessity of buildug non sup, thtotirh \ hieh
a shot cannot pais, ar 1 generally defended tha
policy which had been pursued in the giadual in-
crease of the navy.
The first question was on corcurriny in the
amendment of die Senate sink" g out {¡355,000
and insetting §800,000 so as to make ihe appio-
pnation read $2,800,000 instead of $2 335,000, a'id
when the vote wa.^ taken, it resulted in a>es 66,
noes 89.
So ihe amendment was rotconcutred m.

lowing amendment of the Senate
