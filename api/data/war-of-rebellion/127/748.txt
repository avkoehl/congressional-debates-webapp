As soon as this proclamation made its appearance in all parts of the State companies were organizing and tendering their services; in less than five days the number of troops offering exceeded 5,000. This requisition did not state whether they were to be received by companies, battalions, or regiments. A subsequent requisition for 5,000 additional troops, received on the 21st of April, 1861, gave the authority to organize them into battalions and regiments. Under this requisition the following proclamation was issued:
