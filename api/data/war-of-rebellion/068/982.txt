SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE, May 10, 1864.

(Via Guiney's, 11th. Received 2.45 p.m.)

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

General Grant's army is intrenched near this place on both sides of the Brock road. Frequent skirmishing occurred yesterday and to-day, each army endeavoring to discover the position of the other. To-day the enemy shelled our lines and made several assaults with infantry against different points, particularly on our left, held by General R. H. Anderson. The last, which occurred after sunset, was the most obstinate, some of the enemy leaping over the breast-works. They were easily repulsed, except in front of Doles' brigade, where they drove our men from their position and from a four-gun battery there posted. The men were soon rallied, and by dark our line was re-established and the battery recovered. A large body of the enemy moved around our left on the evening of the 9th and took possession of the road about midway between Shady Grove Church and the Court-House. General Early with a part of A. P. Hill's corps drove them back this evening, taking one gun and a few prisoners.
