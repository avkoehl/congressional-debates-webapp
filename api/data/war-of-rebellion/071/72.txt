Lieutenant-Colonel LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The rebel cavalry left the Point of Rocks last evening after robbing the people and stores of money and such goods as they wanted to carry into Virginia. They were Mosby's men, and were not over 120 strong. Our scouts saw them leaving and could count them. We can get nothing from Harper's Ferry. The Washington troops I send to Monrovia to be armed and supplied with ammunition there, were in no condition for service on their arrival here.
