HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

In the Field, April 12, 1865.

Bvt. Major General M. D. LEGGETT,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say, in sending the inclosed order,* that he wishes you to send an officer in the morning to explore the road taken by the Fifteenth Army Corps to-day, and if you think it better to take that road than to follow the Fourth Division to do so. The orad of the Fourth Division, after passing the swamp, is good, but the Fifteenth Corps road is the shortest. Use your own judgment about it.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. E. WARE,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
