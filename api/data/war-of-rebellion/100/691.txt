General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: General Wheeler reports that a force of the enemy yesterday crossed the Little River at Kennedy's Bridge. I have directed General Wheeler to send a part of his force on the other side of Little River and watch any movements of the enemy there. As soon as I am satisfied that the enemy have retired on this road I will leave a picket on it and move the rest of my force over to the other road. I am now holding Moccasin Creek.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.

There are but three other small regiments with Dearing, and I think it was contemplated by General Lee to order it on to Virginia. I request most respectfully and earnestly that you will have the order sending it to the Cape Fear River revoked. I venture to express a doubt as to the expediency of sending either of these regiments there.

Any cavalry placed between these rivers would be in a perfect trap, whilst the South River would prevent any operation to the east of it. Why should the enemy desire to use the Cape Fear River?
