It was understood among the men that Ashbe had been ordered to Berryville, on account of forces said to be advancing upon Winchester. The prisoner is intelligent, an seems to be perfectly honest. Our advance is near Martinsburg, and a force also at Falling Waters. My troops are not yet in condition to march.

A skirmish took place this morning between the rebels and Tenth Maine near Waters, 8 miles in front. No one was injured. I have just received information that 4,000 of the enemy are advancing on Falling Waters. It is expected they will make an attack. They have five pieces of artillery.

Have received information to-day which I think should be transmitted, but not published over my name, as I do not credit it altogether. A merchant from Martinsburg, well known, came to inform me that in a confidential conversation with a very prominent secessionist, also merchant of that town, he was informed that the policy of the South was changed; that they would abandon Richmond, Va., everything South, and invade Maryland and Washington; that every Union soldier would be driven out of the valley immediately. This was on Friday evening, the night of attack on Front Royal. Names are given me, and the party talking one who might know the rebel plans. A prisoner was captured near Martinsburg to-day.
