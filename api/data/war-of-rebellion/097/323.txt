Major General J. W. TURNER,

Commanding Independent Division, Twenty-fourth Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that if you have not already got it you will have a bridge made across Hatcher's Run at your left, near the Crow house, so that troops can be moved rapidly to the other side of the run from your position. This must be done to-night, as it is a matter of great importance.

Respectfully, yours,

J. H. POTTER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: General Merritt is moving out this morning on the road leading from Dinwiddie Court-House to the Five Forks. He will not go as far west as the Five Forks, but will, if there is no opposition, take the right-hand road at J. Boisseau's and get onto the White Oak road. General W. H. F. Lee's division was still at Stony Creek last night. Our trains did not get up last night. The road at the crossing of the swamps was very bad.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
