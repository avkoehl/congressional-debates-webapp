The number of Union wounded as reported in the different hospitals is, at Independence, 50; Kansas City, 64; Mound City, 56; Fort Scott, 62; Westport, 14; and Newtonia, 43; total, 289. Of rebel wounded, at Independence, 23; Westport, 39; Mound city, 62; Fort Scott, 16, and Newtonia, 46; total, 189. The rebel medical officers at Newtonia stated that their retreating army was taking with it over 400 wounded officers and men. In the vicinity of Cane Hill they had left 34 too badly wounded to be taken farther. So far as I have been able to learn the mortality among the rebel wounded has been much greater than that among our own, there being a greater proportion of wounds of the abdomen and lower extremities in the former than in the later. At Newtonia, on my return, I found that out of 46 treated by their own surgeons 17 had died, while at the hospital under the care of Doctor Akin 6 only had died. At Mound City I found on my return that 16 rebels and 3 Union wounded had died, the number of each treated being about equal. I have heard nothing of those brought to Fort Leavenworth for treatment.

I should in the proper connection have stated that the wounded at Mine Creek belonged principally to General Pleasonton's command, and that I found one assistant surgeon who claimed to have charge of them, but was without means or ability to provide for them. As soon as they were placed in hospital said officer went forward to join his command, which he met near Fort Scott returning from the field.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. B. DAVIS,

Surgeon, U. S. Volunteers.
