His Excellency the PRESIDENT, Washington, D. C.:

I asked for the Parrot guns from Washington for the reason that some expected had been to weeks nearly on the way, and could not be heard from. They arrived last night. My arrangements had been made for them, and I thought time might be saved by getting others from Washington. My object was to hasten, not procrastinate. All is being done that human labor can accomplish.*
