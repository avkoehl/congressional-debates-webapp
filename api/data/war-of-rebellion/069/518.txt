HEADQUARTERS, June 2, 1864.

Major-General GILLMORE:

I have the examined a half dozen of these prisoners. There was no charge made by anybody but the picket-line. One very intelligent Pole informs me that Colonel Dantzler, who was killed, said, "Boys, they are evacuating; we will go in and have some fun," and they charged to find out, in order, they said, to understand why we did not reply to the shelling last night. There are no troops massed in our front. There is the line only, weakly defended. Four brigades left there three nights ago, and Evans' brigade, a portion of whom made this charge, were sent from the left to hold their place, they proposing to hold their right by means of Fort Clifton. I have ordered over all of Duncan's brigade from Spring Hill.

B. F. BUTLER,Major-General, Commanding.
