Goldsborough to-morrow. Tell Chesnut to remain and report to Colonel Lipscomb on his arrival. Enemy's cavalry can be easily driven back. Guard well the railroad and county bridges over Neuse River, so as to keep open communication this way. Do not evacuate until driven away. No small force can do that. Colonel Whitford will remain for defense until ordered from here.

HEADQUARTERS,Smithfield, March 17, 1865 - 10. 30 a. m.

General R. E. LEE:

General Hardee was yesterday five miles south of Averasborough. He was repeatedly attacked during the day by your divisions of the enemy, but always repulsed him. The enemy was reported at night to have crossed Black River to the east at various points with the rest of the army. General Hardee is moving to a point twelve miles from Smithfield. Schofield's troops are reported at Kinston, repairing the railroad bridge. Cheatman's corps not yet up. This railroad, with its enormous amount of rolling-stock, has brought us only about 500 men a day.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
