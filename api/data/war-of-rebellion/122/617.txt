Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: The First Iowa were three-months' men. We have in the service the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Infantry, and the First and Third Cavalry, besides two batteries of artillery. We have the Eleventh, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Infantry full here, the Twelfth Infantry full at Dubuque, and all the companies supplied for the Fifteenth Infantry at Keokuk. We have the Second Cavalry full here and the Fourth Cavalry nearly full at Mount Pleasant. The lancers are nearly ready at Burlington. The Sixteenth and Seventeenth, Irish and German, are organizing, but we want to raise another infantry regiment. We have so many offers that we know not what to do with the men unless you authorize another regiment. Will you not authorize it? The Governor informs me that he has requested it, and I have made this brief statement, hoping that you will be enabled to gratify the wishes of our people.

Truly, yours,

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.
