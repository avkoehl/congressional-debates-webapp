HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,August 11, 1864-1 p. m.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: General Crook's command has been ordered to Parkins' upper mill, on the Front Roayl road. The Nineteenth Army Corps will also follow. Push your cavalry out toward Stephens City, if it can be done without fighting infantry, watching out well down the Fort Royal road, as some of our trains will be parked at White Post. If General Custer should be pressed, General Crook will go to his support after he reaches the Millwood pike. The Sixth Army Corps will move over to the Millwood pike. Colonel Lowell's cavalry will move on Winchester. The major-general commanding will be with the Nineteenth Army Corps.

Very respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,August 11, 1864-10.45 a. m.

General MERRITT:

I do not think it best to go beyond the Front Royal pike, for there is a good force of infantry in front of Custer, and they would move down and cut your off. If possible occupy the pike and send up a party toward Winchester, and if they can get about three [miles] from the Double toll-gate, it might warrant sending a small party toward Newtown. Send me back now about every fifteen minutes how things are going. There is firing with Custer, but he has sent no report. I have directed him not to engage their infantry till I can hear from you.

Yours, &c.,

A. T. A. TORBERT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,August 11, 1864-11.15 p. m.

General MIRRITT:

I will withdraw all of Custer's except one regiment. General Crook's infantry will go out on the road you are no. the head of the column is about a mile from this pike. Do not allow them to turn you. If you have to fall back, come back on the road you went out on. I send you the last dispatch from General Sheridan.*

Yours, &c.,

A. T. A. TORBERT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
