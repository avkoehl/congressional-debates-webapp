Brigadier General H. l. BENNING,

Commanding Brigade:

Yours of 5,30 this morning is received. I have already written you this morning to bivouac to-night at Harris' Shop (the cross-roads just at our late headquarters). The courier may have missed you, and I therefore send this back to you at once. I have already sent orders to Colonel Baker to employ his command in covering the movements of the trains, and on his approaching Somerton to report his arrival there to the commanding general. His movements will, of course, conform to those of the trains. I hope these orders have reached you. They were, as in yours, duplicate.
