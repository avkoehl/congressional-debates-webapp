Honorable E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to report that on the 28th ultimo I was ordered by General McClellan to assign from my command two good regiments to French's and Howard's brigades, Richardson's division, Sumner's corps, to join that command in its embarkation at Alexandria.

I was likewise ordered at the same time to replace the Thirty-seventh New York Volunteers in Heintzelman's division, that it (the Thirty-seventh) might be assigned to Meagher's brigade.

Referring you to may letter of the 2nd instant for a statement of the character and amount of the force at this point and the reasons for urging that it should not be diminished, I have now further to state that, after a careful inspection of the forces under my command I do not find any regiments fit to take the field. I beg leave to ask your instructions under these circumstances. As Sumner's corps will embark, as I understand, to-morrow, it is desirable that I should receive your command at once.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. S. WADSWORTH,

Brigadier-General and Military Governor.
