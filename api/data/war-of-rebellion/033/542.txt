POST CARE GIRARDEAU,

September 18, 1863.

General FISK, Commanding:

A. J. Youngman reports outrageous excesses committed by a party of the Sixth Missouri Cavalry, near Sikeston. Jackson Whaley was murdered in his own house. Mr. Youngman's store was robbed. He was shot at, and violence was otherwise offered. Citizens are in great fear of life and property. No officer was with them. I am convinced, general, that these men are a terror to the country. Many citizens are killed and robbed by them.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., September 18, 1863.

General FISK, Commanding:

The informant said Major Montgomery would protect them, but these hell-hounds threatened them with death if they told him. The major does all he can, but no one helps him. Gillette will tell you how it goes. I have ordered Major Montgomery to arrest the robbers and murderers in his own interest, as well as that of the citizens. These men straggle and plunder whenever they are out without him. I dread the report when they come in from the Osceola trip.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., September 18, 1863.

Major MONTGOMERY, Bloomfield:

Is Sergeant Kelly at your post now? If so, arrest him, and find what was the name of the soldier who tried to shoot Mr. Youngman at Sikeston on the 15th. Also find who killed Mr. Whaley just before, and who robbed the store of Mr. Youngman. Arrest all whom you find implicated in those murders and robberies. The citizens report terrible outrages by your men while over there.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
