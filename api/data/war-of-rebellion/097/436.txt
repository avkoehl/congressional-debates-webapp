rear so fast I despair of getting to the front. Our casualties are not large as far as I can learn. The infantry flanked them; the cavalry took breast-works. Divide the glory.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: Colonel Savage, Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry, is here wounded; leg amputated. Pickett's division went to Five Forks last evening, and the rebel cavalry are said to have left for there about 10 or 11 a.m. [p.m.?] I have sent a reconnaissance toward the Forks.

[General SHERIDAN:]

GENERAL: I am at the junction of the Ford road and Dinwiddie road. Have connected with the Second West Virginia Cavalry one mile from this point in direction of the Forks. A few rebels are in my front, on what I call the Dinwiddie road. Have just sent a regiment to drive them. Will send a scout to bridge across Stony Creek, one mile and a half from this point.

Very respectfully,J. IRVIN GREGG,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

P. S.-A rebel deserters says the infantry went toward Stony Creek from this point. I give the rumor for what it is worth and for your information. Will try to ascertain the truth.

[General SHERIDAN:]

GENERAL: I am just in receipt of report from Lieutenant-Colonel Corrie, commanding Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, in which he says he has driven the enemy two miles from this point, on what I call the Dinwiddie Court-House road. From the firing the resistance seems to be determined. The country is all woods. No enemy has moved in the direction of Stony Creek, except a picket of fifteen or twenty men. I send a dispatch of General Lee.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,J. IRVIN GREGG,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
