unworthy of association, they will be left with the
skeleton of a party. Do they mean it as a reproach
to me ? I am willing to bear it Here, sir, in the
presence of the American people, I avow that I
was a Federalist, and acted with that party zea-
lously and actively, so long as their flag waved m
New Jei!>ey Standing here, as it were, with the
ejes oi the immortal Father of his Country—the?
head and leader of the party to which I belonged—
intently fixed «pon me, I should be imvorthyot my
pitsem honorable position, il I hesitated to make die
avowal Sii, it is an honor to any one to hav e been
a humble follower of the purest and moot unsul-
lied Democrat that evei lived Who, sir, were
the leaders oí the New Jersey Fedeialists? For,
sir, I hold myselt answerable only for their sins
and my own I i eject all imputative mus. They
were the men whose Demociacy was tued by the
lires of the Revolution, who had assisted in that
glonous struggle in the field and in the cabinet
and in toiming the Constitutions which now suppoit
our liberties They weie talented, high-minded,
and honorable, and, above all, they weie eminent-
ly American and patriotic When I arrived at
manhood I found them prostrate, in a hopeless mi-
nority, and crushed by what I considered an oli-
garchy, whose claims ¡or Democracy weie not
equal to those U the Federalists whom tin.) ex-
pelled fiom power.
Sir, the Fedeial part), while it ousted in INiii
Jersey, after 1 oecamc ol jge, never had but one
year ol power They have leu sins ot comims-
sicw to answei tor. The} stood in opposition, and
I stood with them, side by side, until alter Hie de-
claration of the late war, and the invasion of the
country by the British I thought then, and still
think, that although theie had been abundant
cause for wai liom the tune of the attack on the
Chesapeake, that it was declared rashly, and that
the Groverement had not done us duty in putting
the countty in asíate of defence But, sir, when
the country was invaded, I thought it the duty of
every man to go for the country.
I had hoped, sir, to have seen the veneiablt' man,
who was at that time the Jeadei oi the 1 edei il pal-
ly in New Jersey, (and a more paiuotic, heroic,
and American heart beats not m anj bo om,)iu the
place which he his oeonpied on lici il '•Ms in tins

lemained with them with unshaken fidilit/ until
that time, although some difiered with me, no doubt
honestly,as to the ce uise 1 h.-d taken in the war
We vvere conuue'cd, sir, bj oui friends, not bj our
foes But not by our friends m Nevv Jersey There,
sir, we furled our flag «Un our own hands, still
bearing the national stupes and stars undisgraccd
The era ol good feeling commenced with Mr
Monroes admmistiation Tho friends of internal
improvement in New Teisey were about com-
mencing those great «oiks which will immoital-
i/e them, and which Ins given to the State sueh
prosperity My feeble e\eition were invektd
in that cau e, and I enieied the Legislature
as a lepiesentative of one ot the most Demo-
citic counties in the Sta e Parly feeling
was calmed and subdued for veiil vears Ihe
tine fani', hmvevet, «hen the principles which
are always working in Republican G ifrnments,
weie about to exhibit themselves in new torms
New parties were formed I had bpen dis"hirged
from all parties by the -voluntary iishandmg of
the party to wh ch I belonged 1 had remained
nemral for years When 1 thought the proper mo-
went had arrived, Í took "my muskeg cartridge-
box, and shot pouch," and entered the caucus, the
great Wittenagemotte of the Democracy of Hun-
terdon county But I did not go "solitary and
alone ' Those who had stood side by side with
me in my course duung the late Wat, went with
me I was opposed by some who made the
same objection that has been made here I
did not meet that objection by denial, but
justification I told them that I had drawn
my Federalism from the principles of the
Revolution, the Constitution of the United States,
and Washington's Farewell Addiess. The De-
mocrats found that my Federalism and then De-
mocracy did not differ much, and that difference
related to the past, and the> honored me with their
confidence. Sir, I have nevei abused that con-
fidence, and the last pulse which beats in my
bosom w ill be m gratitude lor their lavors, and m
devotion to their seivice
Sir, I entered the Demociatic ranks, not as a
detaiter, fen I left no patty, but as an American citi-
zen should meet his /ellows, conscious ol the purity
oí his own purposes, and 1 «is leouveel and tieated
wiihaconiidcneeeqtiai to that which I had evinced.
It i «quired no sauitice em either side to cement
our union
Sn, 1 uciii joined any puty, but when it was
in a mmoiity, nor have I i ver asked oí any parly
with which 1 acted as much as they m their bounty
weie willing to bestow I have never deserted
either paity or i i tends, noi.sn, have they been
impoi timed, distráeted, or weakened, to promote
my ambition orinteiesi
My colleague, with some seom, speaks ol mo-
dern Demociacy, and says that he went to bed one
night a Democrat, and lose ihe next morning a Fe-
di-ralist Sir, it such a sudden metamorphose took
place, his demociaey mtiot lmc been composed of
' such still as dieams an undo of—"like sha-
dows licamt, and like shidovvs it departed ' My
demociaey, however model a it may be, neither
came «o suelden!), nor will it, I hope, be .o eva-

Now, sir, whetner tnis Demejcracy is fiom the
scnool of Federalism or Republicanism, ol Wash-
ington or JefTeison, T shall not inquire It is my
Democracy
Mr President, I bow in submission to the voice
of the people of New Jersey, but that voice is not
declared by these resolutions. The Legislature mav
command, but they assume an authority t.ot dele-
gated, if they arrogate to themselves the right to
bind the people of New Jersey by uttering then-
voice as the voice of the people. Have the people
changed? for they must have changed, if these re-
solutions declare their voice. In what constitution-
al mode have they evinced that change? I have
not been able to discover it At the last Slate
election the friends of the Administration polled
more votes in the disputed counties m that State
than they ever did on any former occasion Many
oí the strongest Demociatic counttes were divided
by two tickets, both pi ofessmg the same political
sentiments m favor of the National Administration
Sir, at the time these resolutions were pa«sed, no
one of the people or the Legislature had seen this
bill which it is pretended is condemned by the voice
of the people ol New Jersey Then, Mr Presi-
dent, 1 shall look to the Constitution and the instruc-
tions of the Legislature of New Jersey, twice sanc-
tioned by the people, foi my guide I shall vote ioi
keeping (as the laws now provide for collecting)
the public tieasure by constitutional officers, cho-
sen, amenable to, and regulated by, the Constitution
and Jaws, solely for the public use—instead ol
placing it to be kept in the possession and custody
of bank agents—chosen by banks irresponsible to
the Government or the people—to be used for the
sole and exclusive profit of banks III err m this,
my enor is m the Constitution, and the remedy is
with the people. I commit myself with unshaken
confidence to their hands, and submit my actions
to their judgment and decision, which with m«
will be decisive.
THE FULTON CLAIM
SPEECH OF MR. DUNCAN,
Oi Ohio.
In Home of Representatives, Match 30, lb38 —The
motion of Mr 'I iiompson to reconsider the fol-
lowing bil[, passed by the House on a former
day, came up for consideration

Mr DUNCAN rose anel said, when the bill in
question was under consideiation, he attempted
briefly to explain his reasons why, at that time, ho
could not give it his support His reasoas weie,
that the fuends of the bill had laded to convince
him, as well as many others that the enormous
sum of one hundred thousand dolíais, or anv-other
sum, was due from this Govcn mem to the heirs ol
Robert Fulton
He at tint time moved a postponement of the
bill foi a short period, until he, as well a^ others,
desirous of the same thing, could investi-
gate the matter, and be prepared to vo e
umlerotandingly, but that motion failed He then
moved a call ol the House, to the end that theie
might be a full vote on the quesUon of the passage
of the bill, but in this he was also unfortunate
such seemed to be the determination to pass the
bill, that he did not know but that his humble ef-
forts to secure a re consideration would not be view-
ed m any other light than that of temerity, but he
w is happy to find himself m good company, for he
knew of many members who were anxious lor a
recons deration whose judgments were stipenor to
his own, are! whose charity, humanity, and single
ness of h^art were m no particuhr inferior to that
of those who v eie exerting themselves to sccuie
the appiopi latum c mtained m the hill
Great reliance had been plac ed on the vigilance
and scrutiny oí the Committee of Claims, who re-
ported toe bill, and a most unmeasured, unbound-
ed, and eloquent eulogium had been pronouncewl
on the chairman ol tha.t committee, for his superior
skill and depth of research.   This was due, in
