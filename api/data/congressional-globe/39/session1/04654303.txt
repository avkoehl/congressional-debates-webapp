THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

last session, and the consequence was a report
by a board, and upon that report a bill was in-
troduced appropriating, perhaps, $2,000,000 to
pay the iron-clad contractors. The only justi-
fication for that bill was the report of a board
organized under a simple resolution of the Sen-
ate. I object to this resolution, and I hope the
Senate will have nothing to do with it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, the resolution must go over.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I will state to the Sen-
ator that that resolution would have covered
this ease, and Mr. Bestor and Mr. McCord
could have taken their testimony but for the
fact that the action of the board was before
they ' completed their contract. They only
want an opportunity to take the testimony. I
do not know that I shall vote for the claim
eventually; I do not commit myself to that;
1 only desire to allow these parties to present
their case.
Mr. HENDERSON. I object to the reso-
lution. I wish to lay no foundation for an-
other iron-ciad bill at the next session of Con-
gress by a resolution of this kind at the lieel
of the session.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, the resolution cannot be consid-
ered.
military service abroad.'

lution; which was considered by unanimous

ible with the public interest, to transmit to the Sen-
ate copies of all correspondence not heretofore pub-
lished, between the Government oftheUnited States
and the Governments of France and Prussiasince the
4th of March, 1857, touching the claim to military ser-
vice asserted by those Governments in reference to
persons born in those countries and who have since
become naturalized under the laws of the United
States.

by every member of the body. I shall cherish
these associations in grateful remembrance as
long as I live.

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Saturday, July 28, 18GG.
The House met at eleven o'clock a. m.
The Chaplain, Rev. C. B. Boynton, made
the following prayer :
Accept our thanks, O God, that in circum-
stances of peace and mercy Thou hast brought
these men once more together on this the clos-
ing day of the session. We pray, O God, that
this important chapter of American history
may, through wisdom and grace granted unto
them to-day, be worthily brought to a close.
We thank Thee for all Thou hast enabled them
during this session to do ; for all that has been
accomplished in the cause of right and free-
dom ; for the benefits that have been conferred
upon the masses of the people in this land, and
for the encouragement that has been given to
those in all other lands who are struggling to
gain and establish their rights. O God, grant
unto them that reward which is due. And
now that they are about to separate when the
duties of this day are over, O God, we pray
that it may not be a final separation. We com-
mend them all individually to the holy keeping
of our God. Will the Lord guard them on
their homeward journey from all the perils of
the traveler, watch over all their interests, and
may they meet their friends in peace and health.
O God, guard in safety every family circle, and
every dear home, that they may meet each other
in peace, and feel that God has guarded and
blessed them. We beseech Thee, O Lord, that
they may all be spared to meet again when
another session shall commence to celebrate a
new triumph for the right, to perfect that which
remains undone in bringing all the policy of
the Government in accordance with the eternal
principles of Thine own. Will God bless all
the officers of the Government to-day. Bless
the whole country. And when next a prayer
shall be offered before Thee here, may we have
still greater cause for thankfulness to God for
all that He has done for the United States. We
ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.
Mr. STEVENS. It is evident to all that the
Journal of yesterday's session cannot have been
made up by this time ; I therefore move that
the reading of the Journal of yesterday be dis-
pensed with.
The motion was agreed to.
enrolled bill signed.
Mr. TROWBRIDGE, from the Committee
on'Enrolled Bills, reported that they had ex-
amined and found truly enrolled bills of the
following titles; when the Speaker signed the
same:
An act (S. No. 138) to increase and fix the
military peace establishment of the United
States;
An act (S. No. 265) to protect the manufac-
turers of mineral waters in the District of Co-

MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is informed
that the enrolling of the bills which were passed
just before the adjournment this morning, and
their examination and comparison by the Com-
mittee on Enrolled Bills cannot be completed
in less than two and a half or three hours.
The Senate_ have been informed of that fact,
and they will probably agree to the request of
the Ho'use to extend the sesssion to half past
four o'clock this afternoon.
Mr. MILLER asked and obtained leave to
have printed with the debates a speech he had
prepared upon the general political questions
of the day. [The speech will be published in
the Appendix.]
Mr. STEVENS. I had laid down to get
some sleep when the vote was taken upon
agreeing to the report of the last committee
of conference upon the disagreeing votes of
the two Houses upon the civil appropriation
bill. I now ask leave to record my vote in the
affirmative.
No objection was made, and leave was ac-
cordingly granted.
Mr. ROLLINS asked and obtained leave to
record hjs vote in the negative upon the same
bill.
Mr. SPALDING asked and obtained leave
to record his vote in the affirmative upon the
same bill.
Mr. WILLIAMS asked and obtained leave
to record his vote in the affirmative upon the
same bill.
deaths of prisoners of war.
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication from the Secretary of War, in an-
swer to a resolution of the House calling for a
report of the number of deaths of Union and
rebel soldiers while held as prisoners of war;
which was laid on the table and ordered to be
printed.
reconstruction.
Mr. STEVENS. If it will prevent the doing
anything worse, and the House will indulge
me, I will make a few remarks on House bill
No. 623, to enable the States lately in rebel-
lion to regain their privileges in the Union,
and which was under consideration when we
were last in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I think I must object.
Mr. STEVENS. I will yield the floor when-
ever anything else comes up. I do not want
any action whatever.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I supposed the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] would
want some action by the House. I never knew
him to make a speech without having some
purpose in view.
Mr. CONKLING. Of course he has some
purpose in view.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I will not object, if there
is to be no action.
Mr. STEVENS. Before making the remarks
I have to submit, I desire to indicate some
amendments that I wish to have made in the
bill. And that they may be properly under-
stood, I propose to include in my remarks the
bill as I desire to have it read when perfected,
and which will be as follows:
Whereas tho eleven Stateswhich lately formed the
government called the confederate States of Amer-
ica have forfeited nil their rights under the Constitu-
tion, and can be reinstated in the same only through
the action of Congress; Therefore,
Be it cnactfd by the Senate and Jlnute of Iieprescrtta-
tine? of the United States of America in Congress assem-
bled, That the eleven States lately in rebellion may
form valid State governments in the following man-
Sec. ZAndbeit further enacted, That the State gov-
ernments now existing de facto are hereby acknowl-
edged as valid governments for municipal purposes
until the same shall be duly altered, and their legis-
lative and executive officers are hereby recognized
as such â€¢
Sec. 3. And he it further enacted, That the President
of the United States shall within six months, and
as often thereafter as he shall deem proper, issuo
