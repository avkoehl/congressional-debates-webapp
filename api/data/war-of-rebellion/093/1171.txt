FRANKLIN, November 30, 1864-7.10 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

The enemy made a heavy and persistent attack with about two corps, commencing at 4 p.m. and lasting until after dark. He was repulsed at all points, with very heavy loss, probably 5,000 or 6,000 men. Our loss is probably not more than one-tenth that number. We have captured about 1,000 prisoners, including one brigadier-general. Your dispatch of this p.m. is received. I have already given the orders you direct, and am now executing them.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 30, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Franklin:

Your telegram is just receive. It is glorious news, and I congratulate you and the brave men of your command; but you must look out that the enemy does not still persist. The courier you sent to General Cooper, at Widow Dean's, could not reach there, and reports that he was chased by rebel cavalry on the whole route, and finally came into this place. Major-General Steedman, with 5,000 men, should be here in the morning. When he arrives I will start General A. J. Smith's command and General Steedman's troops to your assistance at Brentwood.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
