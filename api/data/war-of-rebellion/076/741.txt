CAMP ON CHATTAHOOCHEE, August 31, 1864-9.30 p. m.

(Received 2.30 a. m. September 1.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT:

Wheeler to-day cut railroad and telegraph first near Wartrace, and later between Elk River and Cumberland Mountains. His operations have been in a line near Cowan. No communication with Sherman since my last; but heavy artillery firing was heard southeast of Atlanta this morning, distance about fifteen miles from Vining's. Slocum's reconnaissance found too many rebels before Atlanta, and returned.

J. C. VAN DUZER.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Renfroe's Place, August 31, 1864-5.45 p. m.

[General SHERMAN:]

GENERAL: There is no musketry to be heard at all, but occasionally the report of artillery on our left. Our trains are moving to the front. Colonel Strong, of General H[oward's] staff, just passed, on his way to the right, to verify the report of one of Kilpatrick's men, who says that General K[ilpatrick], who was holding a bridge over Flint River, two miles south of the right of the Army of the Tennessee, has been driven away from the river by rebel infantry. A rebel prisoner belonging to Cleburne's division says they were ordered to move to the south and turn our right.

Respectfully,

CHARLES EWING,

Acting Inspector-General.
