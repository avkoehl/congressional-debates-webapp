Washington, February 5, 1846.
The Secretary of State, to whom has been re-
ferred a resolution of the House of Representatives
of the 3d instant, requesting the President to com-
municate to that House, " so far as, in Ms opinion,
is not incompatible with the public interest, all
correspondence which has passed between the
Government of Great Britain and this Government,
or by or between any of the officers of said Gov-
ernment, in relation to the country west of the
Rocky mountains, since the last annual Message
of the President to this House," has the honor to
lay before the President the accompanying pa-
pers.
All which is respectfully submitted.

Sir: * * * * * *
# *■ # * * * *
The President has received information, from a
variety of sources, which he cannot disregard, tluit
Great Britain is now making extensive warlike
preparations. As her relations with all the powers
of Europe seem at present lo lie of a peaceful char-
actor, the prevailing and natural inference here is,
that these preparations look to a rupture with the
United States on the Oregon question. It is of
vast importance that this Government should, as
early as possible, ascertain their true character.
You are therefore instructed to embrace the first
opportunity of bringing this subject to the notic.c
ol'the Earl of Aberdeen, in such a manner as you
may deem most expedient. * * *
* * * * The President i.s
also anxious to learn your own opinion upon this
.subject with the least practicable delay.

Louis McLanh, Esq., &c., itc., &c.
Mr. McLane to Mr. Buchanan.
London, January 3, 184G.
Sir: I received on the 29th of December your
despatch, dated the 13th of that month; and on
the day following, I sought an interview with
Lord Aberdeen, in order that, in conformity with
your instructions, I might bring to his notice the
warlike preparations making by Great Britain,
and, if possible, ascertain their real character and
object.
It will not escape you that upon such a subject
it is not always easy to obtain very categorical
answers, or entirely definite official information;
and I did not doubt that a frank personal confer-
ence was the best, ifjiot the only mode, of obtain-
ing any satisfactory information whatever.
In introducing the subject, I adverted at the
same time to the information the President had
received from a variety of sources, of the extensive
warlike preparations making by Great Britain,
and the natural inference upon his part that, in the
■present pacific state of the relations of Great Brit-
ain with all the powers of Europe, they could only
look to a rupture with the United States on the
Oregon question. * * * *
«  • *
Lord Aberdeen said very promptly and frankly
that it would be improper to disguise that, with the
sincerest desire to avoid it, they were obliged to
look to the possibility of a rupture with the United
States; and that in such a crisis the warlike prepa-
rations now making would be useful and important;
buthe stated at the same time, very positively and
distinctly, that they had no direct reference to such
a rupture; and would have been made, in the same
way, and to the same extent, without regaid to the
relations of Great Britain and the United States.
He also adverted to the fact that such prepara-
tions as were actually making had been commenced
before the relations between the United States and
Great Britain had become as serious as they now
appeared to be, and therefore could not at that time
have had any connexion with difficulties which had
since grown out of the Oregon question. He
thought, too, that the representations as to the ex-
tent of the preparations must have been exaggera-
ted. He denied that they related particularly^ as I
had been informed, to a distant service, or that they
were making any addition to the old form of marine.
He stated that the most extensive and formidable
parts of their preparations were the fortifications of
the principal and exposed ports and stations, which
he thought could hardly be supposed to guard
against invasion from the United States; and to the
increase of the number of steam -vessels in lieu of
the old craft, which it appeared other nations were
about to adopt, and which he confessed he thought
a matter of doubtful policy. In short, he assumed
the preparations in progress to be only a part of a
wise and prudent system of national defence and
protection, and of preparing in time of peace for
the exigencies of war, if it should unfortunately
come from any quarter whatever; and he dis-
tinctly repeated his disclaimer that they had par-
ticular or direct reference to a rupture with the
United States on the Oregon question, or any other
ground.
In regard to my own opinion upon this subject,
which the President has been pleased to desire, *
* * « *   * *
it is altogether probable that the possibility of
other difficulties from other quarters m Europe *
# # * * # # #
may have its influence in dictating the policy of the
extensive preparations in progiess in all parts of
the kingdom; and, with unabated confidence in the
frankness and straightforwardness of Lord Aber
deen, and without meaning to distrust in the slight-
est degree the sincerity of his disclaimers in our
recent conversation, 1 do not think it ought to be
assumed by any one that warlike preparations upon
such a scale as that upon which they are unde-
niably making here could not luuo even an indirect
reference to the possible tontin^eney of a lupture
with us. Arid at the same time it is perfectly ob-
vious that tliry are. in a great degree, and especial-
ly so far as tliey consist of an augmentation in the
number of steam-vessels and of the naval marine
generally, precisely of the character to be. the most
appropriate and the most useful in a war with our
country. 1 am not prepared lo say, nor do 1 deem
it material to decide, liovv far we have a right to ex-
pee tan explicit disclaimer of the character and pur-
poses of the warlike piepnratioiiK now making by
Great Britain under the circumstances. They may
be the dictate of various moti\cs of policy, and the
result of many causes; and, without attempting to
assign to each its particular influence, I am by no
means prepared to admit that the apprehension of
difficulties with the. United States had no share in
them; and it is very clear that if a rupture with the
United States should grow out of our present diffi-
culties, this country will be as fully and effectually
prepared for it at all points, and for all possible
purposes, as if that, and that alone, had been the
object of all her warlike preparations. She will
be in a situation to act and strike as promptly and
signally as she could have been with her eneigies
exclusively directed to that end; and I feel it my
duty to add, that not to expect, in case a rupture
becomes unavoidable, that this Government, thus
in complete armor, will promptly and vigorously
exert her utmost power to inflict the utmost possi-
ble injury upon our country and all its intca-osts,
would not be doing-justice to such a crisis. *
# * •* ' # # # •£
I think it ought to be expected—indeed, from all I
learn, I cannot doubt—that, m case of hostilities,
the aim of this Government will be to strike its
heaviest blow at the commencement, in the expect-
ation of being thereby enabled to shorten the dura-
tion of the war. <"****
I I have the honor to be, <fec.,
! LOUIS McLANE.
The Hon. James Buchanan,
Secretary of Slate, Washington.
Mr. Tottenham, to Mr. Buchanan.
Washington, December 27, 1845.
An attentive consideration of the present state of
afhurs, w-ith reference to the Oregon question, has
determined the British Government to instruct the
undersigned, her Britannic Majesty's Envoy Ex-
traordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, again to
represent in pressing terms to the Government of
the United States the expediency of referring the
whole question of an equitable division of that ter-
ritory to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign
or State.
Her Majesty's Government deeply regret the
failure of all their efforts to effect a friendly settle-
ment of the conflicting claims by direct negotiation
between the two Governments.
They are still persuaded that great advantages
would have resulted to both parties from such a
mode of settlement, had it been practicable; but
there are difficulties now in the way, in that course
of proceeding, which it might be tedious to re-
move, -while the importance of an early settlement
seems to become at each moment more urgent.
Under these circumstances, her Majesty's Gov-
ernment think that a resort to arbitration is the
most prudent, and, perhaps, the only feasible step
which could be taken, and the best calculated to
allay the existing effervescence of popular feeling,
which might otherwise greatly embarrass the ef-
forts of both Governments to preserve a friendly
understanding between the two countries.
The Government of the United States will see,
in the proposal winch the undersigned is thus in-
structed to make, a proof of the confidence of the
British Government in the justice of their own
claim. They will also see in it a proof of the readi-
ness of the British Government to incur the risk of
a great sacrifice for the preservation of peace and
of their friendly relations with the United States.
It is made in a spirit of moderation and fairness,
of which the world will judge.
The British Government confidently hope that
the Government of the United States will not re-
ject a proposal made with such a friendly intent ion,
and for a purpose so holy.
There is nothing in it, they arc convinced, not
perfectly compatible with the strictest regard for
the honor and just interests of both parties, par-
ticularly when it is considered of what small value
to either is the poition of territory which, in reali-
ty, forms the subject of controversy, compared
with the importance of preserving a state of peace
and good will between two such nations.
The undersigned takes advantage of this oppor-
tunity to renew to the Hon. James Buchanan the
assurance of his high consideration.
K. PAKENHAM.
The Hon. James Buchanan, &c.
Mr. Buchanan to Mr. Pakenham.
Department op State,
Washington, January 3, 1846.
The undersigned, Secretary of State of the Uni-
ted Suites, has the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of the note of Mr. Pakcnham, her Britannic Ma-
jesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni-
potentiary, dated the 27th ultimo, by which, un-
der instructions from his Government, he proposes
to the Government of the United States " the ex-
pediency of referring the whole question of an
equitable division of that (the Oregon) territory
to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or
State."
The undersigned has submitted this note to the
President, who, after having bestowed upon it that
respectful consideration so eminently due to any
proposition emanating from the British Govern-
ment, has instructed him to give to it the follow-
ing answer:
The British Government do not propose to refer
to arbitration the question of the title to the Oicgon
territory, claimed by the two Powers respectively.
It is a proposition to refer to a friendly sovereign
or State, merely the partition or " equitable di-
vision" of that territory between the parties. It
assumes the fact that the title of Great Britain to
a portion of the territory is Valid, and thus takes
for granted the very question in dispute. Under
this proposition, the very terms of the submission
would contain an express acknowledgment of the
right of Great Britain to a portion of the territory,
and would necessaiily preclude the United States
from claiming the whole before the arbitiatoi.
This, too, in the face of the note of the undersigned
to Mr. Pakenham of the 30th August last, bv
which the President had asserted, in the most
solemn form, the title of the United States to the
whole territory. Even if there were not other
conclusive reasons for declining the proposition,
this alone would be deemed sufficient by the Pres-
ident.
The President heartily concurs with the British
Government in their regret that all attempts to
settle the Oregon question by negotiation have
hitherto failed. He cannot, however, concur with
that Government in the opinion that a resort to
