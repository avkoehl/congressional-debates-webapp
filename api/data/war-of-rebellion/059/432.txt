Martin's command has joined Roddey, but any accurate information of their strength I have not been able to get. All the indications would show an intention to attack this place. My opinion of their movements on the Somerville road and the Courtland road at the same time is to induce us to send out a part of our force to attack them at one of these points while they will attempt to strike us with the other.

Everything is quiet on the river above and below as far as I can hear, and no movement except in this vicinity.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Decatur, April 20, 1864-4.20 p.m.

Major-General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

No news. All quiet here. A considerable rebel force near us.

General BRAYMAN, Cairo:

Your dispatch of yesterday just received. Telegraph me the earliest authentic news from Red River. McPherson has sent the necessary orders for Washburn to command at Memphis, Prince at Columbus, and Hurlbut to join his corps at Decatur. A. J. Smith's division will follow by river, and Mower remain at Memphis for the present.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 20, 1864

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

Let Hurlbut come around with his corps. Ewing has a district in Kentucky lying wholly east of the Tennessee River. Prince's district would be defined as you say, but he should not stop as against any enemy at any line. Any commander of troops on the Mississippi should act against any enemy he can reach.

Colonel Wilson passed in the night, and I approve your instructions to Gresham. Make similar ones for General Washburn at Memphis.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 20, 1864

General HURLBUT, Cairo:

You are not relieved of the command of the Sixteenth Corps, but were relieved of the command on the river by General Washburn. You will join your corps at Decatur, via Nashville.
