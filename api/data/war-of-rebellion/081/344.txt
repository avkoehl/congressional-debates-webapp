Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

It may become necessary, in connection with the expected attack on Wright, to occupy strongly a line along the Jerusalem plank road. The commanding general directs that you make preparations at once to put your available batteries in position to silence the enemy's batteries near the Gregory house, which enfilade the plank road.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

There are twenty-eight guns now that can fire at the vicinity of the Gregory house posted along my front. Twelve of these belong to the Second Corps, which I will replace with mine at dark this evening, if they will withdraw them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
