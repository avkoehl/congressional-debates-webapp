Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL:

I inclose a copy of my Special Orders, Numbers 5, of March 23, 1862, and of a letter from Brigadier-General Woodbury of this date, in reference to the means of landing my command on the Lower Chesapeake.

It will be seen from General Woodbury's letter that the means on which he has been relying are beyond his reach and under an office not subject to his or my control It will therefore be necessary to make such arrangements at the Headquarters of the Army of the potomac as shall effect the object indicated in my special order, herewith, and that the means be so placed, or the person in charge of them so ordered, that there shall be no failure when the First Corps shall have occasion to land.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding First Army Corps.
