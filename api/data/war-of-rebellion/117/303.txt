General M. C. Meigs:

The Atlantic, Merrimac and Coatzacoalcos leave to-day for Fort Delaware. Each can carry and cook for 1,000 men. If Captain Gibson gets rid of 3,000 prisoners he ought to be able to spare a company for each vessel. I cannot spare a man. I have not men enough for guard and police duty. Captain Gibson will of course receive the necessary orders from Washington.
