new orleans mint.
Mr. McCLERNAND introduced the following
resolution; which was read, considered, and agreed
to:
Whereas if is reported that near a million dollars, con-
sisting of the money of the United States and of individual
deposits, was lately in the custody of the superintendent
of the mint of the United States at the city of New Or-
leans ; and whereas it is abo reported that that officer lias
refused to payadraft of the United States out oftheirown
money in his custody, and has appropriated the whole of
the contents of said mint to the use of the revolutionary
authorities in the State of Louisiana, and lias put the Uni-
ted States at defiance; and whereas it is also reported that
the same revolutionary authorities have seized the custom-
house of the United States at said city: Theiefoie,

spectfully requested to communicate to thisflouse, at an

PATENT OFFICE! REGULATIONS.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois, offered the following
resolution, and asked that it be referred to the
Committee on Printing:
Resolved, That the Committee on Piintmc be instructed
to include m the printed report of the Patent Office the
form^, rule-*, and regulations of that office necessary to be
observed in applying lor patents.
Mr. BURNETT. I do not think that that res-
olution goes to the Committee on Printing, because
I think it changes existing laws.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I will state to the
House the object of the resolution. I presume
there is not a member of this House who has not
frequently been called upon for the forms neces-
sary to be observed in applying for patents, and
they have been compelled to write to the Patent
Office for them. Jf they are printed with the agri-
cultural and mechanical parts of the Patent Office
report, they can always be obtained in every
neighborhood, because those books are distrib-
uted everywhere. As a matter of convenience,
these regulations should be printed as indicated
by the resolution.
Mr. PHELPS. Is not the gentleman from Illi-
nois aware that whenever the Commissioner of
Patents is applied to for a copy of those regula-
tions, he forwards them without any extra ex-
pense ?
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. That is very true.
Mr. PHELPS. Why, then, print them >
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. If these forms were
to be found in the Patent Office reports, which
are scattered everywhere through the country,
they could easily be obtained by all persons who
desire them, without being compelled to apply to
anybody. Sometimes persons, at great inconve-
nience, are obliged to go ten, fifteen, or twenty
miles, to see somebody who is familiar with the
business of the Patent Office. I have received-
variouslettersupon this subject,and have received
numerous applications for these forms; and it does
seem to mo that,-inasmuch as the cost will be
small, and the value of the reports will not be
diminished thereby, these forms ought to be pub-
lished in the back part of the book.
Air. PHELPS. As the matter of printing a
document is not before the House, I move that
the resolution be referred to the Committee on
Printing.
It was so referred.

Whereas the " Gulf States" have assumed to secede from

whereas it is behoved that those who are inflexibly opposed
