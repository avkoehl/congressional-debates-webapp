40th Cong....2d Sess.
Pacific Railroad Freight Tariff—Mr. Washburn.
HQ. OF RJBES.
until the road should be completed was repealed,
also the five per cent, net earnings to apply to
liquidate the bonds, and the provis:on for ap-
plying the earnings of the road on Govern-
ment transportation was also altered so as to
require but one half to be so applied, and all
restriction as to amount of stock that any one
man could hold was removed. The land grant
was doubled, giving the different Pacific roads
a territory, according to the report of the Com-
missioner of the General Land O-ffice, " within
one fourth of twice the area of England, Scot-
land,Wales, Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle
of Man, and the islands of the British seas,
and less than a tenth of being equal to the
French empire proper," and nothing that the
ingenuity of man could invent for their benefit
was withheld. This is the present aspect of
affairs.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I think
there is'a history about that matter which ought
to be published to the country.
Mr. HIGBY rose.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I do not
yield to the gentleman from California. ITe
shall have full opportunity on this subject, and
I want to hear from him and the other Cali-
fornia members, for no part of the country is
so much interested as is that State.
The work is progressing with unexampled
rapidity, as well it may, since Government fur-
nishes every dollar in money that is necessary
to build it. The public are rejoiced to know
that it is going so rapidly forward ; and, as 1
have before said, no one will go further than I
to hurry its early completion, due regard to
the rights of the people being in the meantime
had ; and what I now wish to show is that
before issuing any more bonds we should insist
upon securing the rights of the public for all
coming time. Failing in this, let the Govern-
ment at once take the control of the road and
build it through as early as possible, and make
it a cheap line of commerce between the At-
lantic and Pacific. Why not? If the Govern-
ment furnishes the money to build it why
should it give it away to a company of monop-
olists, who are free from all control in their
dealings either with the public or Govern-
ment ?
Now, how all these changes were wrought
by which the public interests were sacrificed
is not for me to say or even conjecture.
Mr. WASHB CJRNB, of Illinois. If the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin will permit me, I can
tell him something about how it was passed.
I was here.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I must
decline to yield for that statement. No mat-
ter now how the act was passed. I suppose
it is no use to advert to that matter. 1, of
course, do not believe that any corrupt in-
fluence was ever used upon any member of
Congress; i would not intimate anything of
the kind; but I believe I state nothing more
than what is notorious when I say that the vice
president of that road has charged the com-
pany with $500,000 as having been expended
in Washington to secure the passage of that
act; claiming that the money was expended in
a confidential way, and declining to furnish any
vouchers.
Mr. PRICE. The gentleman is referring to
the first act.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. No, sir;
the act of 1864. The company had not the
money in 18G2.
Mr. HIGBY. I am sorry to hear the gentle-
man make the statement which he has just
made. This is the first time I have ever heard
it intimated that any money was used to pro-
cure the passage of the act of 1864.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I make
no reflections whatever. I will simply say that
I state what is a notorious fact: that the vice
president has claimed that lie used money in
a confidential way in Washington. But there
is one significant fact which I may bo pardoned
for adverting to, and it is this: that in this act
of 1SC4, virtually voting away $60,000,000 of
the people's money, the opponents of it in vain
demanded the yeas and nays upon the final
vote on agreeing to the report of the confer-
ence committee of the two Houses, and by
which vote the bill was finally passed.
Nothing shows more clearly where we are
drifting than the fact that this Pacific Railroad
Committee, only three or four days ago, at-
tempted to report another Pacific railroad bill,
from Portland, Oregon, to connect with the
Pacific road at the north bend of the Humboldt
river. In looking at the line for this road I
find that for the first one hundred and twenty-
live or one hundred and fifty miles it will run
south, up the rich and thickly-settled Willa-
mette valley, and then, turning in a southeast
direction, cross mountains and plains, until it
reaches the Humboldt river, a distance of six
or seven hundred miles, and requiring subsidies
at the rate of $16,000, $02,000, itnd $48,000
per mile, together with the usual land grant
of twelve thousand eight hundred acres per
mile.
Mr. PRICE. The gentleman is mistaken.
Mr. WASHBURN of Wisconsin. I am
glad to hear that I am mistaken. I know that
my friend tried to report a bill from his com-
mittee, but he informed me that his only object
was to have it recommitted and printed. 1 do
not understand that he is in favor of any such
bill, but I speak of it to show that there is no
end to the demands of these men who want
Government subsidies. Now, Mr. Speaker, I
will assert, prove, and maintain that the Gov-
ernment of the United States will furnish every
dollar necessary to build these roads, and that
for these vast advances Government has prac-
tically no security whatever. By computation it
appears that the Government subsidy will aver-
age about thirty thousand dollars per mile for the
entire distance. Jn thejudgwentofreliable rail-
rood men there is not-to exceed throe hundred
miles of the entire ling that will cost to exceed
that sum per mile, while a large part of the
rest of the line will cost far less ; yet, I find
that when the bill of 1864 was up for consid-
eration it was stated on the floor of the House
that there were many miles that would cost
$500,000 per mile.
Mr. DODGE. I hope the gentleman will
allow me to ask him a question.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Certainly.
Mr. DODGE. I want to know how a rail-
road can be constructed from the Missouri
river to the Pacific ocean at that price, when
there is not a road running hi his own State
that has not cost from twenty-five to sixty-live
thousand dollars a mile.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. They cost
anywhere from twenty-five to two hundred
thousand dollars because of the rascality
which prevailed in the early management of
those who built and controlled them. There
are hundreds of miles of railroad in my State
that could be built to-day and fairly stocked
for $25,000 per mile, yet these same roads, by
a kind of conjuration known only to railroad
men, represent a cost on paper of four times
that sum.
There is great exaggeration about the diffi-
culties attending the building of these Pacific
railroads. If gentlemen want information I
will give it to them. I will give the gentleman
from Iowa, [Mr. Dodge,] the very able and
distinguished engineer of the road, some of
his own figures, i will refer to his report of
18G8. It was asserted in Congress in 1804
that there were miles of this road that would
cost $500,000 per mile to build. Here is my
friend's own report made in 1868; audi will ask
the reporter for the Associated Press to take
down the figures I shall read, so the public may
see for themselves. 1 read from the engineer's
report, page 22. I will publish the entire
table in the Globe, but will only here state the
result of the figures, and leave gentlemen to
form their own opinion as to how much it will
cost to build such a road. The table of grades
shows upon the line from Omaha to the east-
ern line of California a distance of one thou-
sand six hundred and twenty-two and a
half miles ; of dead level ground two hundred
and seventy-two miles; from level to twenty
feet, per mile, six hundred and-sixty five miles ;
ranging from twenty feet to forty feet three
hundred and forty-three miles; from forty
feet to sixty feet per mile, ninety-six miles;
from sixty to eighty feet per mile, eighty-one
miles; from eighty to one hundred feet per
mile, forty-five miles; from one hundred to
one hundred and sixteen feet per mile, thirty-
seven miles:
