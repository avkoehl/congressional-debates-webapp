THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 18,
Mr PEARCE íemarked that the signntures to
it seemed to be, many oí them, in one handwri-
ting
Mi BURGES explained, that the original me-
morial of which this was a counterpart, was pre-
sented to the Senate
Mr PEARCE denied that the memorial sp9ke
the voice of the city of Providence, for as there
weie 19,000 nihabi ants in the city, 1050 could
not be consideied such a number as to be called
the voice of that city He had no doubt that there
was some pleasure, but it must evidently be ex
aggerated, and he thought that they wanted light
and information as to the cause of it It was not
moie than three weeks since large sums, amount-
ing to nearly $300,000, had been loaned by mhab
itants of Piovidence to merchants of New Bed-
ford and of New Yoik This evinced that there
was not so great a scarcity of money as was rep
resented, rnd he aigued that if there was, that
the Legislatui e of the State of Rhode Island would
have given some expression of tneit opinion, as
well as othei States He could affum that the
Mews, contained m this memorial weie not gener
! liy felt, for at a meeting last week held a.. New
port, called to discus  the measuiesof the 4dmin
íslration, the meeting separated without adopting
any resolutions whatevei The statements made
oi the existirg distress must be ieceived with "ome
grains oí allowance He thought that what was
most wanting at the present crisis was decision,
decision to restore the countiy to its former state,
and thus prevent the country trom haling its prop
erty made one general wieck
Mr BURGLS ssid he was much embarrassed
at the flu contrauiction wl ich had been given to
him by his colleague, and expressed his surprise
that the correctness of those whom he and his col
league knew so well, should be questioned by him
Tie proceeded to suppoitthe views taken by the
memonalists, and did not consider that his col
league could, with nny propiiety, ca'l in question
the statements he had made in legaid to a memo
rial expressly committed to 1 is caie from the cm
¿eñ" ot Piovidence His colleague had madethis
attack upon him without giving him any notice
of his intention to speak on the subject, and he
expussed his regret that his colleague should take
this occasion to si nder the ties of amity which
had heietofore subsisted between them
Mi PEARCL, in leply, insisted that he had
made n> attwk upon his colleague His col
league had gone out of bis entuse in his rennrks,
to mike some statements which, as a representa
Uve in paH of tilt ¡State of Rhode Island, he felt
bou in to coriect The facts which he (Vli P )
liad stated weie not denied In what, then, had
he made any misiepiesentalion on the subject of
the memoiial' H13 object was to exhibit the
views of the people of Rhode Island on thi3 sub
ject in a tine light Jle believed that if the ques
lion of bank or no bank were presented to the
people uf that State, theie would be found a ma
lority in opposition to the bunk Thiee ycais
ago there v/ould not have been five hundred votes
in opposition to the I ank But a great change
had taken place m public opinion on this subject
in Rhode Island His colleague had given to the
House p irt of a speech which had been concocted
for unuihei occasion This was, perhipsj as
¿ood an occasiuti as any for delivering it and it
was not his intention lo n ake any leply to his
argument He wished his colletguc to learn that
he w is rot to consult lum in legaid to his couise
in this House In reli tion tohiscolleague'scouise,
he sh-rnl I never expiess any ieftrev, and he hoped
that In coheigue would cease to express hi 
legie s. a' 1 is (Mi P\ ) cou>\,e Peisonilly, he
in «¡named a legaid for his, colleague, and, be
fo e this session, they had commonly ac ed to
f,et! ei I' at he now differed fiom h s colleague,
waj only a piooi that his colleague d i'eied from
him
Mr "URGES rejoined, in a few words, which
we e nrt 1 ear I by the leportei
Mi   HARPPR,of Pe n syl/mie, presented ti e

which went 10 contradict the statement putfoith
' that the shoemakers were out of employment "
Mi S took that occasion to say, that there was
moie mischief biought upon the country by the
waste of time in debating the question of the re-
moval tn n by any other cause, he would, there
fore, ertreat the House to come up to the question
at once, and have a decision upon it, one way or
the other
Mi FMRPER disclaimed having said that the
shoemakers were out of employment, he said that
the master shoemakers were afiaid that then re-

they employed must soon be thrown out of em-

the piesent state of the pecuniary relations of the

of General Jackson than himself, and that he had
uniformly suopoited his measuies fie appealed
to the mends of the Piesident on this flooi to say

Mr PATTON called for the reading of the reso-

f-lt it ii3 duty to state, after having, m courtesy to |

lutions, mat he dissented almost wholly from the I
\iews expressed in the memorial      At another I
time he hoped to have an oppoiturfity to lay His
views fully befoiethe House on this subject     H«
only wisl ed now to say that  he dissented from
the opinion tint the Piesident had exercised an '
unconstitutional authority     He concurred n the I
opinion that the measure of the Piesident was un-
wise and  id timed, but at the same time he be
lieved that he had acted honestly, and tnat h" had
done tint «Inch he had a light to do, and winch
it was, ^oieover, ni„ co i titutioiml duty to do
In regard to the policy of restoring th«, deposHes to
the Bank of the United States, he also dissented
wholly from the memorialists The question
whether the bank should be rechartered, was, in his
opmion, inseparably connected with the question
wnethei the deposites should be restored What
good weie we to do by restoring the deposites,
without accompanying it with an assuiance that
the bank should be rechartered' The dismay and
distress would, in a few months, return upon us
with aggravated severity, unless the bank felt
assured that its charter would be renewed He
saw nn leason, foi his own part, to believe that
the bank would he rechartered, he believed that
if the question, whether the bank should be re-
chartered, or a bank should be charteied, weie
now put to this House, there would be a majority
of this body against it If the bank was certainly
to be rechartered, he wou'd, without hesitation,
vote for the restoiation of the deposites
