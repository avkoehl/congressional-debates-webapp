Crittenden, with Leonard's command, should remain at Boonville, watching broken squads of the enemy along the La Mine. Instructions asked. Sent your orders to Morton. Don't forget ford across Osage at Duroc.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 14, 1863-3 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

Let Crittenden remain at Boonville with his present force and scour the country, especially along the river, and pick up the scattered rebels who may come that way.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 14, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel T. T. CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Boonville, via Tipton:

General Schofield directs that you scour the country, especially along the river, and pick up the scattered rebels who may come that way. News of General Brown's victory yesterday received. Watch the La Mine country.

LUCIEN J. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 14, [1863.]

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis:

A messenger from Syracuse to Tipton says rebel are retreating in force via former place. Major Brown, at La Mine, says the lieutenant commanding at Otterville reports rebels approaching latter place. Rumors at La Mine report Price coming north, and already at Warsaw. Edwards' forces have caused the rumors, doubtless. I have sent your instructions to Crittenden.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 14, [1863.]

Colonel N. COLE, via Tipton:

By direction of Major-General Schofield, you will move with your command to Sedalia, or some point where you can fall upon the enemy if he attempts to escape southward. General Schofield says General Brown has plenty of troops to deal with the rebels, and the great object now is to intercept their broken columns. If you are with General Brown, show him this. If you are away from him and acting under his orders in an important movement, you must then exercise your discretion; otherwise obey General Schofield's, as above indicated.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.
