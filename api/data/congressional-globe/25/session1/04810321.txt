weighed nothing in the seale, when opposed to the glory  f
'the constitulioi al cuirenry Orders were sent to France to
transmit 'he amount oí the four instalments of the mdenmity
j at J in P ebruary, 1636 amounting to near four millions of dol
tars, in gold i o procure tfai« quantify of gold, a draft was
made upon the London market, which, if it did not create, at
If ar* assisted to augment, that pressure upon the British cur
rem y which commenced m April, and which every one knows
has be n continued, wllh occasional fluctuation*, up to the 11th
March, 1837 the date of the last advices, and which has been
latterly augmented by the additional demand for nearly another
million of dol] ire, the amoun' of the fifth instalment of the m
demmtypaiJ bvFrtice in ÍYbruary last It is not pretended
that the whole pleasure on the English money marktt within
t íe last > ear has been occasioned by the last mentioned' hum
be efforts to ret re 'the constitutional currency ' Other de
mands for gold have ej lsted amongst them ene by the Bank of
America, the pimcipal deposite bank in New Voik, and one
by the Bank of the Uiited fetates, rendeted expedient by the
íapil return of hei notes foi payment m the early part of
183b, owing to the substitution in then place, throughout the
Western and Southwes ern oourtry, of the notes of some of
General Jackson's three hundred and fifty eeven new banks
' Of the practical operation of these two 'humble efforts'up
on the immediate interests ofihe citizensof the United States it
behooves us now to speak
' The contraction of the British currency, as every mtelh
gent observer knows, has been to create a pressuie for money
in England, which has pro luced the *bl!owmg result

In addition to these causes set in operation by it e ííov ei n

11,1836 This circular enacted by Executive oiderthat alter
the 15th day of August, 1836, the receivers of public money and
the deposite bank  should receive in pa; ment of the j ubnc lands
nothing but gold and silver, and m ti e proper places "S irgir la

himself eays, " that (he prospect of íevolsion was present to
the nimds of considerate men before it actually came " Why
was no warning given, no preparation made? Were our rulers
not ' considerate men? ' Is it not true, as I hare shown, that
up to the fourth day of March last they weie still crying m the

and they intended their effects' No matter what are the causes,
the mm isheie' and the Administration designed to bring it
upon the country forthe diabolical pm pose of establishmgupon

Yes sir, lie very result of all these causes of mischief, what
ever i hey may be is now proposed as the second eystem—
enothei expcinneut' This result is whathas been aimed atall
