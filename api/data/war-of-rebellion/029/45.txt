enemy's attack. The rebels were in sight before any disposition for action was made of the infantry, a part of which was assaulted before being fairly in line. The fight lasted less than one hour and a half. The loss was about 150 in killed and wounded. Two brigades of our troops, under Colonel Harlan, were at Castalian Springs, only 9 miles distant from the scene, but their commander had no intimation of an anticipated attack from Colonel Moore, who commanded at Hartsville, or he could have moved forward, so as to be able to co-operate immediately upon the morning of the fight. Colonel Moore, One hundred and fourth Illinois, the brigade commander, was a prisoner at the time the within documents were submitted, and his own report does not, therefore, appear; but, from the evidence given, the disaster seems to be attributable mainly to his ignorance or negligence.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

FEBRUARY 13, 1863.

I respectfully recommend that Colonel Moore, One hundred and fourth Illinois Volunteers, be dismissed the service for neglect of duty, in not properly preparing for the enemy's attack on Hartsville, Tenn.*

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Approved:

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
