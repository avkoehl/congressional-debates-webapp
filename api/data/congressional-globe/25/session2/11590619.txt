SSth Cong«-'-Snd Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Tallmadge.
Senate.
In the hqin lation of the debt due to the banKs from the com
munity, and from the banks to the community, there would not
be as much difficulty as the feenator seems to apprehend
From the massof deb sdue to the banks aie to be deducted first,
the amount of subscriptions which constitute their capitals,
secondly, the amount of deposites to the credit of individuals m
then custody, and, thirdly, the amount ot their notes m circu
lation How- family will these mutual dentó neutralize each
other' The same person, in nusuberless instances, will com
bine in himself the relations both of creditor and debtoi.
The only general operation of banks beyond their discounts
and deposites, whieh pervades the whole community, lb that of
furn shing a circulation in redeemable paper, bey ond the amount
of specie to ledeem it m their vaults And ean it be doubted
that this additional supply of money furnishes a powerful stimu
lus to industiy and pioduction, fully compensating any casual
inconveniences, which sometimes, though rarely, occur1 Banks
reduce the rate of mteiest and repress inordinate usury The
«salutary influence of banking operations is demonstrated m
countries and sections 01 couitry where they prevail, when
contiasted with those in which they are not found In the for
mer, all is bu¡=tie, activity, general prosperity The country
is beautified and adorned by the noble work1'of internal ím
provement, the cities aie filled with splendid edifices, and the
wharves covered with the rich pioductions of oui own or of
foieign climate^; In the littei, all i¡> ¡sluggi^'ines*, slothfulness,
and inactivity England, m modem times I'lustratesthe gr at
advantage  01 banks of cu lit, and of stimulated industry
Contrast her with Spain, destitute of ad those advantages In
ancient times, Athens would present an image of lull and active
employment of all the energies of man carried to the highest
point of cmluation, whilst her neighbor, Sparta with her iron
money, affords another of the boasted benefits of metallic cir
culation
Ihe&enatoi fiom ¡Sonth Caiolina would do the bank<? no
harm, butthey ate deemed by h<m highly mjunoustothe plant-
ing mteiest'   Accord ng to him  they inflate prices and the
poor plantel se"s his piodurüous for hard money, and has to
pinchase his supplies at'heswoln prices pioijuced by a paper
medium    Now, I must dissent altogether from the Penatoi's
statement of the case    Englaru, the punnpal customer of the
planter, is quite as much, if not more, a papei country than
qut*     \.nd the papei money puces of the one country are
neutralized by the pas er money prices ot the other country
if the aiguiiem wcie true that a paper money country trades
dis id vantage o usly  with a hard uioulv cuuutiy, we  ouerhtto
continue to employ a pape   medium to counterbilaa"f? the | a
per medium of England    And if we weie to ba i->h our paj er,
aid suostu i e altogether a metallic cunency, weshouU be tx

against us    An examination however, into the actual state of
exchange between the two countries, for a long series of years,
evinces ihat i'has generally been in our favor     In the dnect
trade between England ar d this country, I have no doub', there
13 a large annual b a anee against us but that balance is ad
justed and liquidated by balances in our favoi in other branches
of our foiei-m trade which have finally concentrated in Eng
land as the ¡«-eat centre ot the commercial world
Oí ah tne wteretts and branches of industry m this country,
none has profited moio by the use and employment of credit
and capital derived from banks ¿ml other curtes than the

Lands, «'avc, utensil*, bcas s of burden ond other supphe
have been constantly housht and still continue to be purchased
upon credit and bank asenev is ah essential to give the most
1 eneficial operamn to these credits, lia., the argument of the
Senator fiom So ith Carolina which lam comb un** would not
be correct if it weietruethat we have inflated pnces on this
sit'e ofthe Atian ic, without a corresponding mflition of puce
on the other Mde, beeau e the planter senei ally selling at nome,
and buying at Jume the proceeds ef his sale wha'ev i they

and consequently neutrali7e each o her In what do we of the
West teceive payment tor the iron ense q lantity of Jiv° stock
and other pioduce of oui industry which we annually sell to
the South and S<mthft «*«, hut that papei medium now so much
denied and deinunced'  Ihe Se íator from South Caio ma i«
veiyfonlo! ne «tate banks but he thinks there is no legi i
matecunei cy except that of the Constitution He contends
that tne povvei which the Government possesses to impose taxes
restricts it, in their payment, to the íeceiptof the precious m
tais But the Constitution does not say so The powei is giv en
in broad and uure-tneted terms and th" Governments left at
Iibertv to collect tl e taxes in whatever licdmm or commodi'v
from the exigencies of the case, it can collect them It i" doubt
less much the m >st convenent to collect them in money, be
cause that represents or can command, everv thing the w ml
of which is implied by the power of taxation But suppose
theie was no money in the coun'ry, none whatever, to be ex
torted by the tax gutbeiei& from an impoverished people is the
power of Government to cease, and the people to be thrown
back into a state of natnn * The Senatoi a ks if taxes could be
levied and collected m tobacco, in cotton, and other commodi
ties'2 Undoubtedly they ctnfd, n the necessity existed for such
an inconvenient imposi ion Such a case of necessity did e\i<-t
in the colonv of Virginia, and o hei colonies, prior to the Revo
lution and fixes were accordingly levied m tobacco or othe*-
coramnlitie r,s wolf scalps, even at thi« day, composea pait i f

The ai2um"ni tlvn of the Senator against the right of the
Govemmen to i  en<* bank notes m payment of public dues
i pi icneec^ al with thec\iVence of the Goveinment, does
nn «eem to me to be sound It is not ac urate for another rea
son Bank no es, v\ hen convenible at the wi'l of the holder into
specie, are so much counted or told °¡ oe,lik< the^pecie^hich
is counted and put in marked kegs íPiotm  the qtrntitv of
then contents The ^epa'or tells us that it has been only wi hm
a few days that he has t1! covered that it ^ illegal to receive
bank notes m payment ot- public dues X>oe<* be think that Uia
usage of the Omernmen nder ail its iimii!istrations,and with
eveiy party mpowei which has prevailed foi nigh fifty ypars,
ought to be set aside by a novel theoiy of his, jubidi earned into
existence, eYen if it possesses the merit of ingenuity*?   The bill
under consideraron, which has been eulogized by the Senator
as perfect in ító structure and details, contains a provision that
bank notes shall be received m diminished proportions, during
a term of six years    Hehimself introduced that identical prm
ciple    It is the only pan of the bill that is emphatically his
How, then, can he contend that it is unconstitutional to receive
bank notes in payment ofpublie dues?   I appeal from himself
to himself   The Senator further contends, that general depo
sites cannot be made with banks, and be thus confounded with
the general mass of the funds on which they transact business
The argument supposes that the money collected for taxes must,
be preserved in identity, but that is impossible, often, todo
May not a collectoi give the small change which he has recei v
ed Uom one tax payer to another tax payer, to enable him to
effect his payment?   May he not change gold for silver, or vire
vert>a, oi both, if he be a distant collector, to obtain an un
doubted remittance to the public Treasury?   What, Mi   Piesi
dent, is the process of making deposites with banks?   The depo
site is made, and a credit is entered for its amount to the Govern
ment    That credit is supposed to be the exact equivalent of the
amount deposited íeady ¿nd forthcoming to the Government
whenever it iq wanted for the purposes ofdisbuisement    It is
immaterial to the Government whether it leceives lack agpin
the i lentical money put in ot othei money ofeqaal value    All
that it wants is what it put m tne bank, or us equivalent, and
that, m ordinary time* with &uch prudent banks as alone ought
to be selected, i' is sure of setting    Again  the Treasury his   i

expenditure necessaiy there for our naval squadrons, and other   j
put poses    They are made to the bankei&, to the Barings or the
Rothschilds, in the form of bilis of exchange purchased in the   i
maiketby the a«cnrs of the Government here, with money   j
diawn out ofthe Treasury    Heieisone convexión of the mo
ney received from the tax gatherer into the Ireasury   The bills
are tiansmitted to the bankeis, I onored, paid   and the ai iount   M
ciedited by th«m w the United States     Are tht bankers bonnl   ¡
to iefai\ the proceeds of the bills in identity?   Aietheybourd    j
to do more than nedit the Government for an equal amo mt

But the true and only efficacious and permanent remedy, X
solemnly believe, is tobe found in a Bank of the United States,
properly organized and constituted We aie toll that such a
bank is fraught with indescribable dangei, and that the Go

bank ofthe Government I oppose to these imaginary terrors
the practical experience of forty years I oppose to them the
issup of the memorable contest commenced by the late Presi
dent of the United States, against the late Bank of the United
States The adminmtiaMon of that Bank had been without sen
ous fault it had given no just offence to the Go/ernment, to 
wards which it had faithfully performed every financial duty
Under its able and enlightened president, i had fulfilled every
anticipation which had been formed by those who crea'ed it,
President Tackson pronounced the edict that it mu t fa 1 and it
did tall, against the wishes of an immense majority of the peo
