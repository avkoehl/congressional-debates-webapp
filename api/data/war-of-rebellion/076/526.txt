HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 16, 1864- 10 a. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

Garrard returned last night about 12 o'clock. His report is being compiled to be sent to you. I think you will find it satisfactory. Several of the colonels of Garrard's division rank Long. The only way that I can see how he can be placed in command of the division will be by getting him promoted. I think Garrard's services on the Augusta road show how thoroughly he performs his work when he undertakes what he has to do. By not rashly pushing on to the main road, regardless of the forces opposed to him, he has preserved to us his fine division, with which I believe he will yet do good service.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I am willing to admit that General Garrard's excessive prudence saves his cavalry to us, but though saved, it is as useless as so many sticks. Saving himself, he sacrifices others operating in conjoint expeditions. I am so thoroughly convinced that if he can see a horseman in the distance with a spy- glass he will turn back, that I cannot again depend on his making an effort, though he knows a commander depends on him. If we cannot use that cavalry now, at this moment, when can we! Wheeler is out of the way, and when shall we use cavalry, if not now! If we wait till Wheeler returns, of course an opportunity is lost, which never is repeated in war.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field,m near Atlanta, August 16, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Garrard will not attempt anything if there be a show of resistance. If you consent, and can give the command of that cavalry to Colonel Long, I will put General Garrard on my staff and send him to Nashville to supervise the equipment and armament of out cavalry, the same office held by General W. S. Smith, resigned.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 16, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I would be perfectly willing to see Long placed in command of a division of cavalry, and should have given him a division last winter if his rank had been high enough. Have you seen Colonel Warner since he was here this morning!

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
