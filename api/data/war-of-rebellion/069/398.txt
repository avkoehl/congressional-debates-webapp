between Crawford and Griffin are out about the same distance. Both lines are pushing on and find no enemy as yet. I have staff officers with both lines. I have ordered them to keep moving whether those on the right or left move or not.

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER.

As my command is now so far out, I should like to get it together before the line of battle advances.

L. C.,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 8.40 a. m.

Captain MARVIN:

SIR: The skirmish lines of my troops, both on the right and left of Crawford, are out 1 3/4 miles. They have connected, leaving Crawford's skirmishers in the rear. The Second Division skirmishers are on my left. Nothing on my right. My right finds no enemy. On my left they are skirmishing with the enemy and hear them chopping down trees.

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.

Captain MARVIN:

The officer in charge of the left of my skirmishers reports the enemy making entrenchments 1 3/4 miles out on the Mechanicsville road. I am supporting my line and pushing it forward. I will try to dislodge them if they are not in too large force.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 9.45 a. m.

Captain MARVIN:

SIR: I have sent three regiments to support my skirmishers on my right; have found the enemy's pickets behind rifle-pits. I think there is no force, but a heavy skirmish line. I am going to try to drive them out, and would like to have Lockwood push up on my left. Crawford's line is so far in my rear, and it is so woody, that I do not care to have him advance for fear they will fire on my men by mistake.

Yours,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
