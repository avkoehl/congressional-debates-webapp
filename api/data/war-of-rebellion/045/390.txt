HARRISBURG, June 28, 1863. General PIERCE, Bloody Run:

I case the enemy march on Mount Union or Hollidaysburg, by falling on their rear or flanks you will demoralize their whole command. Attack them in small parties at night.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

D. N. COUCH:

The enemy were there day before yesterday, between 2, 000 and 3, 000 strong. They have gone back of Sideling Ridge, near Hancock. I have a small scout out there now. Will report to you when they come in.

L. B. PIERCE,

From reliable information, Imboden is at McIlvain's Hotel, 12 miles from us, with 6, 000 cavalry, infantry, and artillery. I have taken the mountain passes in the direction of Bedford. Will hold him in check as long as possible.
