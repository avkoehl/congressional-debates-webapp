Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Mien*
H* of Reps
founders of the Republic in reserving a power to establish a
system of bankruptcy which should be uniform throughout
all the States They foresaw, in some degree, the extent of its
business—of its resources—and that the energy and tadustry of
the people would impel them to husmeas opeiations in every
section, and henre any law of this character, operative in one
State alone, would be partial in its effects, and, particularly for
a commercial and trading people, unjust and oppiessive in us
operations
But let me give a little attention to the gentleman from New
York TMr Ferris] who has made such fine spun constitutional
distinctions    The broad principle and expression of the Consti
tuüon was against him, and when he began to rally his forres
for a constitutional argument, it was a mattei of interest to sec
what ingenious devices he woul t resort to, to make the com
mittee believe thatthe measure was wrorg m principle and
altogether toj extensive in us application, and he tells you that
the words used n tí e Constitution were "to be construed in re
ference to the meaning they had at the ti ne the Constitution.
was formed *'   What then, said he, was the meaning oí the
word "bankrupt?"   "Tomlm's Law Dictionary defined a bank
rubt to b2a tiader who secretes himself or does certain other
acts tending to defraud his creditors" and the gent email
finishes fus definition, which is so peculiarly practical, by say
mg that "the word is derived from bawus or banqup, ti e table
oi counter, and ruptus, broken or gone "   I will not uivVi
take to say whether the l tables oi counters" of this large ci 1^3
01 our counuymen have been broken, but there la m mcubus
upon them h^avy and weighty enoueh at least to break their
noble spims    Do >ou suppose that the noble, phm, practical
men wiu formed that instiument could hive entertained Un
one moment such a limned meaning of that provision?   The
tendency of the age seems to he to tianscendentalism m religious
faith, and abstraction m political faith    Men oí genius and of
learning become di^satisned with the oíd, practical, common
truths, and to feed their love of noveltv they leave too o'ten the
good old track oí common sense    Why, supposing you, sir,
weieoppressm? the people upon the ¡subject of alopung the
Constitution, and one of your good ol! la«luoned constituent*
ahouid ask you what you meant by the meamrgol the wo id
hankiupt, would you make yourself so ridiculous at  to tell
hmi that it mfint a "bench bio ken," or even would you give
him the other defimtnn, that "it means t trader who secretes
fumseifordoe&cciram other acts tending to defraud his ere u
tor&i * He would be very likely to tell you that two muclikdxn
ng h%8 made yon mad
Why nit comedown, m reasoning on this subject, to the
good old fashioned cnmmtnsense, an 1 say that a buikiuptis
aman who cannot pay his dt-bisf Lveiy b >dy u derstinds
it so Still the gentleman's re zoning was quite interesting,
because it was mgernou , but, to tefhumg upon us practical
application, it, it minded me vim y much of a umirk of a in ml
of mine, who fiad just fat en leadin ' a woik oi a distinguished

happy influence it is sought to confine its oppratmn toctitain
classes Therewoull be no pietence fir this even if, at thp
time oftheadoption of the Constitution, the British «tutute had
pnly included merchants    The statute of 3lth and ^th. Henry
VIII embraced all classes of men, and it was remarked by a
distinguished gentleman m the Senate,"that theie never hid
been a period, since the introduction ol bankrupt laws into
Great Britain even unto this dav, when peisons other than tra
deis had not been embraced withm the provision- " Trie act
of6thof Geotge IV not only included meichants and tiaders,
but carpenter", mnkeepeis, printers, bleacher* falser-, drovers,
and others, and now, foisaoth, shall we, in a eountiy where all
our people, to a certain extent, are traders, limit the opeiation
to ceitain cla'se3 Is there not as much necessity foi a law of
this chaiactei, applicable to the manufacturer, who makes
heavy pui chases and sales indifferent sections of the country?
May not the mechanic, the lumberman, or the farmer, need it1*
How often it is that the propel ty of persons following those pur
suits is placed, in the regular course of bu<qne¡,s m the hands of
the merchant, and they may so severely suffer by hisfulme as
to render it impossible for them to fulfil then engagement , and
while Taigue that its. operation should be moie seveie on the
mercantile community, still to the non trading classes  can be
oí no haim, for it is optional with them whether they will take
the advantage of the law or not Let the law be uniform nail
the States, and with all the people, without resard to their pur
suits, «ave that there should be acumpulfoiy ploceos with the
trader in certain ca«es
This law does, indeed, release the person 0/ tip debtor
from impnsonment, and is that light1 Roes the consokra
tion touching peisonal liberty ever entei into d contract1* Did
you ovei, sir, ^oppose that your personal liberty had ai v thing
to do with its fulfilment or now fulfilment'* Where h the man
so lost to peisonal independence as to jeopard in any contract
V is freedom? Every creditor, when he ti ules, expe<t& to get
payment for the article sold, and if he does not, what good
does it do him to have the contio! ovu the pergonal liheity of
the debtoi? Thetenevei ¡should have been, in this country the
power of one citi7en to imprison another foi debt Clime
should be punished—irind should shaie the same fate, but
such a consideration never entued into an honest contact for
th.s woild's stoods The effect upon the dbbfoi is to disable
him from doing the vei y thing he would de neto do When a
merchants m tailing cucumitinees, a'l experience shows that
the «oonei hss affairs ire woun 3 up ti e bettei fe r bin « If -nd

have the power to appoint assignees, instead of the creditors
ihiaio not an objection of go much weight as induces any one,
I think, to go against the bill The object is to have capable
and honest men, andtheieis no hazard in trusting the court
Othersobject because corporations are notincluded This isa
new question—one which is not fieeliom great difficulties So
far as coipui atioi s are concerned, I am m favoi of the most n
gid exaction m the discharge of their duty But they are the
cieaturesofthetota'es, and if Congress undertake by their laws
to control them, it raises a grave question, whether it is not an
an exert íse oí power ovei the rights ofthe State? not contem
plated by the Constitution lie Has it may, is it not sifer to
pass the bill in pursuance of the wishes ol the people, and leave
this giave que&tion of including corporations for more mature
consideration1* Tt would prescribe duties to corporations not
contemplated by their charters and hence, an act of Congress
calculated to give new constructions to all these grants, would
raise Difficult and complicated questions, calculated to produce
high excitement in the public mind The States might be
tuought in conflict w th the Geneial Government, anitbe har-
mony which t-hould ptrvat'e the whole system would be very
much endangered Tosiy the least of it, it is the paitofpru
dence to d Jay action in this particular, till it has been more
fully considered Thedetay can dono ínjuiy—haste and in
cois'dcrate legislation may A sudden and mighty power
wouldnave mured to the Executive in the late suspension of
the banks It would have spread ifelf by its bankiupt com
nu aionstlrough the whole Union, and, instead ofhavmg that
consideratelegislation which has characterized the States, there
would have been no alternative ai d no discie'ion but to let the
' non seal" of the law of Congiess rebt 011 the institutions of
States, oven if it was annihilation to them The argument of
Fxecuuve power, which the gentleman from Kentucky has
made against the bill mitspiesent form, would'apply with
great force if corporations are included But undei this bill
tiiercibno powpi hut tint which is exercised by the courts—
and those couits aie e taohshed, and hence the argument (ails,
because the fact" aie against It The couit has more busi-
ness, but it does not affect the Executive pationagp
It has been contended, too, that by this bill we place about
the debtoi temptations to extravagance and speculation My
own belief is, that it has the contrary tendency—it must make
ciedit moie guarded, and make men moie caut ons in trusting
then property to adventure At least one difficulty will be
avot led, which exists in many of the S ate&  by unue of this
II solvent law that men cannet hold on to their property and
live u luxury and idleness, and leave their honest creditor to
the cold consolation of («ooding over the faithlessness of man
"Vou will bear no more of uch Icbtois living in maible palaces
bidding defiance to then creditors This, of itselt, shows an
inheient defect ofthe state laws It will abolish that ruinous

ail no matter where the creditor may happen to íeaide—it
should resibt the selfish lmr/ottunnies of half the creduois, to
t ie enure exclusion of all the others And it struck me with
suiprise theothei day, when the gentleman horn >ew York
[Mr Terris] contended that the public faith would beimpaired
ataioddby the law—'hat the ttuejgn mercnant would have a

Theie never was asyotem devised which tended to ameho-
rate the conditio i ofthe debtor but what was assailed with the
fiercest cry of a thousand evils and in the fiont íank of whim
wjs traud The ame a^auit, with more fiercene s, was made
on the iaw of axdishing imprisonment for debt, although it
could it could no be denied that '0111 theoiy of fteedom in that
