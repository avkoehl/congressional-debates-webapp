personal explanation.
Mr. ALCORN. I desire to make a brief
personal explanation.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Mississippi asks consent to make a personal
explanation. Is there objection? The Chair
hears none.
Mr. ALCORN. I wish to state that I re-
mained in the Senate the night before last and
last night and until this morning, when what is
known as the Ku Klux bill passed. My under-
standing was that the civil rights bill was then
to be taken up and that the Senate was to
adjourn, and I left the Senate with that under-
standing and went to my room. Subsequently
that bill waa taken up and passed, and the
amnesty bill was also taken up and passed.
Both bills I have felt an interest in. I am
very glad indeed that the amnesty bill was
passed by so large a majority. I wish to say
that had I been here I should have voted for
both those bills.

motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to withdrawing the motion? The Chair

reports 01? committees.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committee on
the Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill
(II. R. No. 1982) to provide for the holding
a circuit court of the United States in and for
the western district of Missouri, have directed
me to report it back and recommend its pas-
sage. I think we can pass this bill in a mo-
ment. There will never be an opportunity to
pass such bills unless we run them through
when we report them.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The struggle on the ap-
portionment bill has been stopping everything
for two or three days, which was reported
from the same committee before. I do not
want to object to my chairman.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think we ought to
run through some of these bills that there is
no objection to. This is a bill to establish a
circuit court at Jefferson City. Nobody will
object to it. It will be passed as soon as it is
read.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I understand a Senator
wishes to move an amendment providing for
another circuit court. I hope we shall have
an order to-day or to-morrow to take up un-
objected cases, and I think this ought to wait
with the others.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will go
on the Calendar.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The same committee,
to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 846) to
provide for holding a circuit court of the United

is a duplicate of the bill which the House has
passed and which I have just reported.
