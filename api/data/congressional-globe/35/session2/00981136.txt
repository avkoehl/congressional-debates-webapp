THE. CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 18,
to strike out that part which the committee has
amended and agreed to.
Mr. HUGHES. I move to strike out some-
thing else with it.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair rules the
amendment in order.
Mr. HUGHES. I offer the amendment in good
faith. I think the whole of this section for the
incidental expenses of the quartermaster's de-
partment ought to be stricken out, partly for the
reasons that have been so clearly set forth by th.e
gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Marshall,]
and which I will not attempt to repeat, and for
others which I will state. It is impossible to dis-
criminate what portion of this sum is intended
for each of the respective items. Furthermore I
wish to say, as I have heretofore said, that, if
any economizing is to be accomplished in the ex-
penditures of the Army, 1 am clearly of opinion
it is to be done in the quartermaster's and com-
missary's departments. It is in these depart-
ments that the profuse and unnecessary expend-
iture of the public money takes place, and not in
the payment of the officers and soldiers. For in-
stance: in the quartermaster's department large
sums of money are expended in the purchase of
horses and mules at high prices, and there is
great room for favoritism in accepting the stock
from the venders After the animals have been
in service for some short time, a board of officers
is called together, and a large number of them are
condemned as unfit for use, put up at auction at
remote points where there are no bidders to be
had, are sold at a mere song, and somebody re-
alizes an immense speculation out of them. All
this is a great waste of public money.
So it is in regard to wagons for the transporta-
tion of troops and public stores. They are con-
demned in large numbers for some slight defect,
and sold for absolutely nothing.
Now, my opinion is, that if we appropriate
#1,840,000 for the regular expenses of the quar-
termaster'sdepartment, we can well dispense with
these incidentals; and 1 believe this House would
do well to strike out the whole section. I offer
the amendment in good faith, and I hope it will
be agreed to.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. The estimates
for the incidental expenses of the quartermaster's
department must, as a matter of course, be con-
jectured. They aie made up of many items, small
in amount; and the only way in which an opinion
can be formed of the sum required, is the expend-
itures of preceding years, if it be contemplated
to retain the Army as it is at present, similar ex-
penses will undoubtedly be incurred in the ensu-
ing fiscal year, as were incurred this year. I have
before me the estimates in detail, showing the
expenditures under this head, during the last fiscal
year, amounting to the sum of $574,491. That
"was the expenditure for the incidental expenses
of the quartermaster's department for the last
fiscal year. *
Mr. HUGHES. I ask the gentleman if he does
not believe that those expenses might be greatly
diminished ?
Mr. PHELPS, ofMissouri. That is what the
Committee of Ways and Means have proposed.
They have reduced the amount from $557,000 to
$500,000; and the Committee of the Whole have
already determined to reduce it to $450,000.
As to the remarks of the gentleman in refer-
ence to the purchase of horses and the condem-
nation of stores, they have no applicability to the
appropriation now under consideration. That
comes under a different head of appropriation.
The gentleman will find, when we reach another
portion of the bill, an appropriation proposed for
the purchase of horses for the mounted regiments.
That portion of his remarks, therefore, whilst
applicable to the military service, was not appli-
cable to these items of expenditure. With regard
to the condemnation of bLoit's,.no stores are con-
demned and sold unless a board of officers has
examined them, and pronounced them unfit for
the public service, and then they ore sold at pub-
lic auction. Does the gentleman from Indiana
desiie that our soldiers should be fed upon this
damaged food ?
Mr. HUGHES. No, sir; but I will tell you
what I desire. I desire to put a stop to the prac-
tice of selling, at a great sacrifice, a large stock of
provisions, which are condemned en masse, be-
cause, perhaps, one or two barrels in a thousand
may be slightly damaged*, thus enabling specula-
tors to make immense profits at the expense of
the Government.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. The statement of
the gentleman from Indiana impugns the integ-
rity of the officers in the military service. If such
cases have occurred, charges should be preferred
against those officers, and they should be put
upon trial before courts-martial. I would con-
demn any such course of procedure, if any such
has been pursued by officers of the Army. I do
not say that it has not been; but if the gentleman
from Indiana has any information upon that sub-
ject, it ought, certainly, to be communicated to
the executive department.
Mr. HUGHES. I hope the gentleman from
Missouri will allow me to say that I am now a
member of Congress, and propose to apply the
remedy to those abuses now in my power. If I
were an Army officer, I might pursue the course
he suggests; but I am not one at this time.
Mr. STANTON. I would suggest if it would
not be better for the people to constitute them-
selves into a court-martial and try the Adminis-
tration at the next election.
Mr. HUGHES. I would recommend the gen-
tleman as prosecutor in that case. After his bril-
liant performance in the case of Lawrence, Stone
& Co., he ought to be public prosecutor for life.
The amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. PHELPS, ofMissouri. I am instructed
by the Committee of Ways and Means to move
to strike out the following paragraph:
" For constructing barracks and other buildings at posts
winch it may be necessary to occupy during the year, and lor
repairing, altering, and enlarging the buildings at established
po^ts, including the hue or commutation of quarters tor offi-
cers on military duty, the lure of quarteis for tioop^, and
store houses for the sate keeping of military stores, and of
ground lorsutnmei cantonments, and for temporary frontier
stations, $700,000."
And to insert, in lieu thereof, the following:
For barciicksand quarters, namely:
For rents, including hue or commutation quarters *'or of-
ficers on military duty, hiie of quarteis loi troops, of store-
houses for the safe-k< epuigof mihraiy stores, of grounds for
summer cantonments, and for tempoiarv frontier stations,
$โข100,000.
For re pans of the barracks and other building? at the dif-
ferent military posts in the States cast of the Mississippi
river, $-30,000
For the construction, aJtfiu'ion, and repair of bar ncks
and other building*, at the different military posts, which
aie or mav be established in the State* of Arkansas. Mis-
souri, and Minnesota, and the Teiritone* of Kansas, Ne-
braska, and the Indian temtorv, ,$"0,000.
For tin* construction, altoiation, and repair of barracks
and other buildings at the difleicut military posts, which are
or may be established in the State of Texas, .-$40,000.
For the construction, alteiatton, and repair of barracks
and other buildings, at the difleient military posts, which
are or may be established in the Territoiy of New Mexico,
$45,000.
For the construction, alteration, and repair of banacks
and other buildings at the different military posts, which
are or may bp established in the States of California and
Otegon, and Territory of Washington, $80,000.
For the construction, alteiation. and repair of barracks
and other buildings, at the diffeient miliuuv posts, which
are or may be established in the 'lVrutoiy of Utah, .<$150,000.
Mr. Chairman, on examining the report of the
duarterniaster General, it will be found that he
reports that it has been difficult to regulate the
expenditures on account of the construction of
bai racks and quarters in the different military
depaitments of the Government. Hitherto, esti-
mates in detail have been made of the amounts
which it was believed would be necessary to be
expended at the different military posts, and they
have been aggregated in the different military de-
1 partments, and we have usually appropriated a
j sum in gross for the construction and repair of
[ barracks, quarters, and other buildings connected
i with the Army. The Quartermaster General, in
j his annual report, invites our attention to the fact
I that he cannot control these expenditures in his
i department, for the reason that the officer com-
I mandmg a post, or the officer commanding amil-
I itary department, may order buildings to be
! erected or repaired, and the quartermaster is
| compelled, under the orders of his superior offi-
i cer, to incur this expenditure. By these means,
1 large sums of money have been expended in a de-
i partment where it was contemplated that a much
' smaller amount should be expended. The &uar-
! tcrmaster General gives a detailed estimate of the
. amounts proposed to be expended nextyear, and
i gentlemen will find it on page 165. 1*he Com-
| imttee of Ways and Means propose to reduce
I the sum, specifying the amounts to be expended
in the different military departments. The whole
reduction recommended by the committee is
ยง195,000.
I have here in my hand the estimate submitted
for the various military posts during the next fis-
cal year, provided this appropriation of #700,000
shall be made. As to whether any is to be ap-
plied to Utah, is conjectural. We-are aware that
barracks and quarters are b&ng erected in that
Territory for sheltering the troops so long as they
are stationed there. The same expenditure must
be incurred in the States ofOregon and California,
and in the Territory of New Mexico. It must
be incurred in Texas, where it is necessary to
repair the buildings at posts there, or to erect
others.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. FAULKNJER. I am highly gratified that
the Committee of Ways and Means have recon-
sidered this item, and have proposed to reduce it
to some extent below the amount reported by
them. I had been instructed by the Committee
on Military Affairs to ask a reduction upon that
item of $300,000. It is difficult, in the form in
which the amendment is now presented from the
Committee of Ways and Means, to indicate the
precise reduction which should be made upon its
several details. Some four or five weeks ago I
submitted to this House a resolution calling upon
the Secretary of War to furnish in detail the ex-
penditures for barracks and quarters during the
last ten years, indicating the locality where the
expenditure took place, what barracks and quar-
ters erected by this Government were now in use
and occupied by our troops, and what had been
evacuated and were no longer useful for military
purposes. His reply, in the form of a bulky,
but very valuable document, has been returned
to this House, and has been ordered to be
printed.
In its absence, for it has not yet made its appear-
ance in the document room, I found it impossible,
with any accuracy of detail, to specify where
these reductions should specially be made. We
were satisfied that there was not a source of ex-
penditure crying more loudly for reform than the
expenditure of money for Government barracks
and quarters. A spot would be selected for a mil-
itary post, extensive and costly buildings are
erected under these general appropriations made
by Congress, and in a few years it is found expe-
dient to abandon it for other sites, and the build
ings become perfectly useless. We were advised
that at one single point, near the Dalles of the
Columbia river, there has been expended for per-
manent barracks and quarters, nearly four hun-
dred thousand dollars. Whether this rumor be
true or not we cannot say, until the document to
which I have referred, be printed.
In the general and unsatisfactory way in which
these appropriations for barracks and quarters
are brought before the House, we have no means
of indicating the particular point where the prun-
ing knife ought to be applied. You have the re-
markable fact stated here by General Jesup, in
his last annual report, that in the western depart-
ment, although the appropriations for barracks
and quarters, for the three years commencing in
1856 and ending in 1853, were but $350,000, yet
there was expended, during that time, $594,182,
being an excess of $242,000 of expenditure over
the appropriations; and on the Pacific for the three
years, 1856,1857, and 1858, although the appro-
priations were $248,000, the expenditures amount-
ed to $693,000, showing an excess of $345,000 of
expenditure over the appropriations.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. What remedy does
the gentleman propose for that violation of law?
There is the real difficulty of controlling the War
Department. What remedy does the gentleman
propose ?
Mr. FAULKNER. The gentleman must be
aware that the rules of the House forbid the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs from making an effort
even for the correction of these abuses by legis-
lation on the appropriation bills. If we were free
to legislate now on this subject, we would have
every quartermaster cashiered who was guilty of
incurring expenditures beyond the amount of
money placed in his hands for that purpose.
Whilst, therefore, we are deprived by your rules
of the power of suggesting legislation on this bill,
we shall seek a remedy for the present in the ex-
pectation that the present Secretary of War will
