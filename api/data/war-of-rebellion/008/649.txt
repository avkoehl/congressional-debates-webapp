Major-General.

CAIRO, ILL., March 30, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I reached Island Numbers 10 last evening about 5 o'clock. Found matters very quiet. A plan was agreed on for active operations, which will go into effect about Thursday. I will write you fully in regard to it. Commodore Foote has asked the Navy Department for more guns, to replace those on his boats, which are nearly worn-out. It is very important to have these guns by the time Numbers 10 is taken, and the Navy and War Departments should by some means manage to forward the guns immediately. We have information here that the rebels are finishing some heavy gunboats to ascend the river. To provide for them and any mishap that may occur to our own fleet in contending with their combined land and water batteries, Columbus and Belmont should be strongly fortified. Halleck and Foote both anxious to have this done. I returned to Cairo this morning. Probably return to island to-night.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of war.

Major-General HALLECK:

I left fleet 10 o'clock last night. Mattes quiet. Bissell progressed 3 miles; fleet confident will get through by Tuesday night. Commodore will give all aid possible.

Columbus and Belmont should have heavy batteries in position soon
