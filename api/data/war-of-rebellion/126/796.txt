The act of Congress approved June 21, 1862, promulgated in General Orders, No. 74, of July 7, 1862, from the Adjutant- General's Office, authorized the payment of $25 of the $100 bounty authorized by act of July 22, 1861, to volunteer recruits on enlistment and muster in.

This advance bounty was paid by the disbursing officer as soon as the recruit, if for an old regiment, was inspected and mustered into the U. S.service; and if for a new regiment, as soon as the company to which he belonged was organized and mustered in.

When this advance bounty was not paid at the time the recruit was mustered in it was entered on the muster-in roll and so continued upon every subsequent muster and pay roll until the soldier was paid by a paymaster, as provided by General Orders, No. 90, of April 7, 1863, from the Adjutant-General's Office.

All volunteers who enlisted under the call of the President of July 18, 1864, were entitled to bounty as follows, under the act of July 4, 1864:

Recruits enlisting for one year........................... $100.00

Recruits enlisting for two years.......................... 200.00

Recruits enlisting for three years........................ 300.00

The first installment of this bounty was paid by disbursing officers to recruits on muster in as follows:

To recruits enlisting for one year....................... $33.33

To recruits enlisting for two years...................... 66.66

To recruits enlisting for three years.................... 100.00

This advance bounty was paid in the same manner and under the same regulations as the $25 advance bounty previously discussed.
