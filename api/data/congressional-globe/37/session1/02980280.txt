Mr. SPAULDING. I desire, Mr. Chairman,
to state some facts with reference to the condition
of the Treasury. In doing so, I must go back
some eight months, in order to show more clearly
what the necessities of the Treasury at the pres-
ent time arc. When we met at the last session
of Congress, in December last, the Treasury was
empty—bankrupt. There was 110 money to pay
the public creditors, who were then pressing for
payment. There was not money enough even to
pay members of Congress. The first duty that
devolved on the Committee of Ways and Means
at that session was to provide the means to carry
on the Government. On the 17th of December an
act was passed authorizing a loan of $10,000,000,
at six per cent., in Treasury notes, with author-
ity to issue them at as Iowa denomination as fifty
dollars, and bearing such rate of interest as the
Secretary of the Treasury should find it necessary
to allow, after advertising for ten days. The Sec-
retary of the Treasury advertised immediately;
and the best bids that he could get, which he
deemed it advisable to accept, were at twelve per
cent, interest. Some of the bids ranged higher,
and some lower than that amount. A loan was
then made at twelve per cent, interest for the pur-
pose of replenishing the Treasury for its imme-
diate and present wants. Subsequently the balance
of this loan was taken at a rate of about nine per
cent, interest per annum. On the 8th of February
$25,000,000 more was authorized by the Govern-
ment to be negotiated; and on the 2d of March a
further loan of §10,000,000 more was authorized
by the tariff bill; and a provision was inserted
authorizing the Secretary to issue any portion of
the $35,000,000 in sums as low as fifty dollars, at
a rate not exceeding six per cent, interest. So
that during the whole time since the adjournment
of the last Congress, the Secretary of the Treas-
ury has had the power, and has offered to the
public, Treasury notes, bearing six per cent, in-
terest, in sums as low as fifty dollars.
Now, sir, the funded debt of the Government
on the 1st of July, including the bonds issued at
various periods, of various denominations, bear-
ing various rates of interest, amounted in the
aggregate, to $70,000,000, or thereabouts. The
Treasury notes which were at that time outstand-
ing amounted in all to about $£0,600,000. But
since that time the Secretary of the Treasury has
borrowed upon Treasury notes, in various sums,
at six percent., at sixty days, that being the long-
est period which he was able to borrow, to meet
the presentdemandsof the Treasury. The Treas-
urer is in the market to-day with his six per cent.
Treasury notes, without being able to get them
taken. The six per cent, coupon bonds are now
sold in New York at eighty-eight or eighty-eight
and a half cents on the dollar—a discount of twelve
percent., or thereabouts. The twelve per cent.
Treasury notes of December last are held in the
New York market at about one hundred and two
—showing thatthe Government is at this moment
unable to negotiate any of the loans that have been
authorized by Congress, except at ruinous rates
of discount.
[Iiere the hammer fell.J
By unanimoiys consent, Mr. Spaulding was
permitted to proceed with his remarks.
Mr. SPAULDING. The Treasury notes that
have been issued at various periods upon the
several advertisements, have been reported by the
Secretary of the Treasury at the commencement
of the present session of Congress, and his re-
port is now upon our tables. It shows that at
(he last advertising of coupon bonds, the bonds
having twenty years to run, could only be sold
at eighty-five, and some of the bids were as low
as eighty-two. tNow this ought not to be. It is
true that the Treasury became bankt upt last year
under the administration and perfidy of Secretary
Cobb. But, sir, I say to the House that instead
of allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to go
into the market with Treasury notes bearing this
ruinous rate of interest, we ought to levy a tax
sufficientto give credit and confidence on the part
of capitalists, so that we can borrow the money
necessary to carry on theGovernment. We ought,
at the last session of Congress, instead of shirk-
ing the responsibility, to have levied n tax upon
tea, coffee, and sugar. We ought to have faced
the music then, and brought up the credit of tho
Government by taxing those articles. We are
here now reversing our steps and proceeding to
do what we ought to have done then. There is
