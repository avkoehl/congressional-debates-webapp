Brigadier-General ARMISTEAD,

Petersburg, Va.:

Do what you can to make the obstructions effective, but I think you had better have engineer officers. Our experience here proves that great confusion results from the two services attempting to work together. If, however, you still wish Captain Pegram I will apply for him.

Secretary of War.
