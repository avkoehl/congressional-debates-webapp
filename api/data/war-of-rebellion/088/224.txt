General MILES:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that while General Gregg remains in front with you will obey any orders which he may give. General Gregg has been directed not to give up his reconnaissance as long as he considers it safe. He had been advised, however, that if General Birney, has heavy and continuous firing you are to close in toward him.
