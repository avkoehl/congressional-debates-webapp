THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 27,
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I will leave the mat-
ter to the House, although my own idea is
that the Secretary of State having examined
the premises which he is to occupy, and hav-
ing made this estimate, his judgment is better
than ours on this question. But I will yield
to the gentleman from New York to make his
motion.
Mr. RADFORD. I renew my amendment,
and wish only to say that I assert, without fear
of contradiction, that pooms equal to those
now occupied by the Secretary of State can
be hired in the city of Washington for $5,000
a year.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I demand the pre-
vious question on the joint resolution and the
amendment.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
Mr. Radford's amendment was agreed to.
The joint resolution was then ordered to a
third reading; and it was accordingly read the
third time and passed.
Mr. RICE, of Maine, moved to reconsider
the vote by which the joint resolution was
passed; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
enrolled resolution signed.
Mr. TROWBRIDGE, from the Committee
on Enrolled Bills, reported that the committee
had examined and found truly enrolled a joint
resolution of the following title: when the
Speaker signed the same:
Joint resolution (H. li. No. 77) for the relief
of Ambrose L. Goodrich and Nathan Cornish
for carrying the United States mail from Boise
City to Idaho City, in the Territory of Idaho,
and of Daniel Wellington and J. C. Dorsey
for extra services in carrying the mails.
land grant to kansas.
The next business in order on the Speaker's
table was bill of the Senate No. 285, granting
lands to the State of Kansas to aid in the con-
struction of the Kansas and Neosho Valley rail-
road and its extension to Red river; which was
read a first and second time.
Mr. SPALDING. I move that that bill be
referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. VAN HORN, of Missouri. I hope the
bill will be passed over informally. There is
a similar bill at this time under consideration
before the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. J ULIAN. I prefer that the bill should
be referred to the committee.
Mr. ANDERSON. I will state to the House
that a bill of the same character as this is now
before the Committee on Public Lands, and
the friends of the measure prefer that this bill
should remain upon the Speaker's table. I
can see no necessity for its reference.
Mr. JULIAN. There is so much hasty legis-
lation hero that I am not willing to forego the
security of a reference.
The question was put upon Mr. Spalding's
motion ; and there wereâ€”ayes 52, noes 17 ; no
quorum voting.
And then, on motion of Mr. STEVENS, (at
four o'clock p. m.,) the House adjourned.

steps in order to secure the establishment of a
United States naval station at some convenient

land may be obtained in the bay of Manoinilla
