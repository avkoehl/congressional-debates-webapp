with heavy underbrush. The enemy were already across the river occupying a very strong position. About 11 o'clock I was attacked by Hindman's division of infantry, a battalion of sharpshooters, and a large body of cavalry. They drove us back steadily, contesting every inch of ground, about 200 yards, where we held our ground. At this time I received and order from General Mitchell to fall back to the hospital, 1 1/2 miles distant. Our entire force consisted of Colonel Long's brigade, about 900 strong. The entire command both officers and men, behaved very gallantry. Among the list of casualties was Lieutenant-Colonel Cupp, First Ohio Cavalry.

The latter-named officer, Lieutenant Henry, was left near Crawfish Spring in a gross state of intoxication, so as to be perfectly helpless and immovable. From this point we joined the remainder of the cavalry force, and fell back to McCulloch's Cross-Roads and moved to Chattanooga.
