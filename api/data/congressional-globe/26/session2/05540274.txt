Making a differenc  of     .                #9,135,815 38
in favor of 1840, ihit is to «¡ay, taking tbi e\ir„< i-
dinary expenditures thrown upon 1841, a>>d ihe e(-
traordinaiy mums furnished to pay uem by Con-
gress, ami the expend tures thrown upon 1840,
and the means furnished to pay ihem by Congress,
and tbere is a difference lie ween th* exlraoMi
nary receipts and expenditures of 1340 and 1841 of
the sum of $9,135,815 38; and if the ordinary re-
eeipts and ordinary expenditure1; of the two years
are the same, there must eventually be a deficien-
cy in the revenue to that amount.
[While Mr. Thiplbtt was commenting on the
item ol 01,580,855, estimated as th<* balance which
the Secreta i y of ihc Treasury supposed would be
m the Treasury—
Mr. Jones rose and said, Mr. Chairman, with
the leave of the gentleman from Kentucky,! wi.l
explain.
Mr Johej's remarks were indistinuly heard by
the Rsponei, but he was understood to My that
01,580,855 was only an «stimale by the Secie ary
of ihe Treasury, and the data on which ihat exí-
mate was founded were given in anothi i p,*t ol
the document, &c ]
Mf TniPLETT. I will come to thnt part &>f 'he
document by and by, add I will show, il Í under
stand the m t or, that those $1,580 855 eo.is sel m
Treasury notes, suosequeutly issued Í have, how-
ever, construed this table upon that íepoii, but I
have also construe'e i another, which show, that
things are even worse
One of the reducaons of five per cen' on the
amount of duties levied on imports takes place in
1841. Yet the Secretary of the Treasury estimates
the amount to be received from rus'oms m that
year at $19,000,000, while the ac ual receipts of
the first three quarters of 1840 were only $10,687,-
884 79, to winch, if you add one-fourth m>re for
the fourth quanes, you have the sum oí $13,362,-
365 98. Would it not have been fair for me pre-
sent Secretary of the Treasury, when making an
estimate for h's successor, te bavesupposed ¡hat Cíe
increased prosperity of the country, and oth r fa
vorable causes, would not have been greater than
sufficient (o counterbalance the reduction of five
p r cent in the levetiu' on vided f< r  by  t e com"
prorai-e  ad2    1  have taken  ti*t as ihe  ba«ts on
wnieh I have constructed this second table, thus-
The ordinary revenue of 1840, nom a'l
sources, was             .                            $17,179 763
The ordinary expenditures of  every
kind were    .... 22,489 349
Showing that the revenues or receipts
did not meet the expenses by             .   2 291 586
Add the difference, as shown bv tli3
first table, of the extraordinary ex-
penditures above the extraordinary
receipts thrown upon 1841 .             .   2,253 373
And you have the sum of       .             .  $4,544,959
Which you must provi le for, (unless you intend
to go on adding to your national debt,) in addiiim
to the §10,549 955 of out tandmg appropriations,
which you are now creating a debt ot $5,000,000
Treasury notes to pay in part.
This brings me to reply briefly to ihe argument
of the gentleman from New York, [Mr Vander.
poel,] who, I think, has totally misapprehended
the Secretary ot the Treasury in his estimates. If
I understood the gentleman co reetly, he s?id that
only the sum of |3 749,904 of the $10 549 955 o<"
the outstanding appropriations would be require 1
to be expended in 1841. This was his assertion;
and, at the time he made it, I turned my head back
and told him he was mistaken He then repealed
the assertion, but it is most assuredly wrong, for
both the sums of $6 061,123 and $.1 749,901 will
b'1 required lor thaservic1 o. the ¡ear 1^41. To
show this, t call fie attention of the fimimttee to
the c >nstru( turn ot the si ntenec m the lepct The
true meaning of the Secret try can on'y b1 ascer
tamed by distinctly tracing out to what the W( rd

construction I have given to the sentence is most

will turn to theiabl" at the ha'k of the Secretary'

fe one, talmg his document fumi-hel by the Se-
cretary cf the Treasury a tro<-, do not sec bow the
means are to be m the Trea~U'y to pay th« drafts
drawn upon it under Jaw< a'read>' p-  ed by Con-
gress. Suppose that, immediately after General
Harrison enters upon ihe administraron of the
Government, not possessing this cabalistic power
"to postpone, by subsidiary contracts," payments
for work done or services rendered, as we are in
for wed has been heietofore d< ne at Old Point Com-
fon—not desiring to exercise tee power which «e
are told has been exercised aJ Boston under the
present Administration, where you are building a
custom-house without paying your hands, but post-
poning those payments also to the first day of
January or first day of April, 1841, suppose, I «ay,
that a draft for these six millions and odd dollars,
and for the three millions and odd, should be pre-
sented at the Treasury, what means have you pro
vided to pay ihem? Will the five millions which
vou propose to raise by this bill n eet them? If not,
I a«k the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Jones] *
aud his party whether they do not thus compel Gen.
ral Harrison to call an extra session, in order to
prevent the faith of the nation from being pros-
trated both at home and abroad? It is as n ces-
sary to pay our debts at home as it is to pay them
abroad. And this deficiency in the Treasury is
permanent. It is in vain to tell me, when we have
now Treasury notes outstanding to the amount of
upwards of four millions and a half; when you
come here and ask for five millions more by this
bill, and when your revenue is annually, regularly,
and from natural causes diminishing—I say it is m
vain to tell me that this deficiency in the Treasury
is not permanent
How, then, will you remedy it? There is a mode
pomted out by the Secretary of the Tre-tsury, (as
to which I have a few remarks to make,) and a
most extraordinary mode it is. At page 10 of his
annual repoit he says.
' It has aheady been shown t'i at the whole amount of receipts
m 1Q11 will piobably be sufficient to discharge all ordinary ex-
pemlitines, and those parts of the outstanding debt, funded or
unfunded, wliiah may become due But the preservation ol a
sm able b ilsnre in t'ie iieasiu} may leqimo more than what
will pulnhly be le ft aftei satisfying >thet pui poses "
And tiipn be points oi.t a mode by which this
end can be aec mphshed, a^ follows:
"The raising of any sum for t nt object m 1841 could, how-
ever, be obviate I by authorizing aeontiact to be made, under
proper restrictions, extending tht penod of payment lor a por
tion of the tempoiaiy liabilities I tl'ingdue in that yeat "
This (continued Mr. T.) is praclis'ng on the Old
Point Comfort doctrines aeain—loctrines which
v.ill thus bee-ome notorious m th-" fiscal annals of
this n*tton
Now, i call upon any candid man to answer this
question: Are not all these extensions of payment,
in fact, a creation of a national debt? Is it not
manifest ihat, wnen money is due for woik done
and material furn.shed, and you postpone the pay-
nvnt to anoiher year, to that extent you have con-
tracted a debt? Tne remedy of the Seeretary of
the Treasury, then, is a national debt. To be sure,
h  baptizes his eh Id by a diffe'-ent name, but lha1
is an ait which may be learned and has been prac-
tised m this Hous", as well as by Ihe Secretary of
the Treasim. Name-, a re most -ignificant things
now a days The creattrn of a national debt is
filled a postponement to a more convenient season
ot th' payment ot the pu'dic dues.
I now ask attention to the following passage,
whieh ímtnedialely fol ows that I have just read:
"Yrt, m the opinion of then ndu signed the best mode of pro
vtdtn-i tor this case would be, without either an extension of
this km 1 or r loan or a further i^^ue ot Treasury notes or a
rhin^em the tanfr, but metely by le^ninsc the tppiopnations
for the sei vice ot 1S4I betow the estimaus or by passing such
leolawtorj clauses as to the piesent tat iff and such acts as to
Ihe public I in 1-- a> have heretofore been nr^ed on the conslde

[Mr. Jones he-e cxphinel, that the estimates
for ihe o'her Departoi ntu were not made out by
the Sectetary of the Treasury, and that he was not
answerable for them, th*y b^ng mate out by the
Seciet=nes of the ftayi, "A'ar, &c ]
Mr. Triplett Ii the gent'eman from Virginia
is corree,, ho ■ does he a count for th'S most unex
plamabl? sentence, at pige 2 of tn° Secretary of the
Treasury's report? In speaking of ¡he estimates
for the fourth quatter < f the year 1840, he says:
'Estimat sby this Department (though higher by the others)
for all expenses Jjnng the fourth quarter, 55,000,000 "
Here we have the positive admission of the Se
cretary of the Treasury ihat the estimates of the
