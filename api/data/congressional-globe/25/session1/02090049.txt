look to the banks as. only incidentally concerned
It is a measure of great public mleiest, and, as I
believe, of great public utility If 'he banks
should happen to suffer by it, I shall regret it , and
if they are benefitted by it, it will add to the satis-
faction I expect to derive from its otherwise benign
operation.
In conclusion, I must object, with my colleague,
to the gloomy colors in which the condition of the
country has been drawn Some difficulties, some
distresses, there may be, but the great elements of
prosperity are yet rife in our land , we have yet
the genial skies and fertile soil with which nature
blessed us , the flag of our country yet w aves
proudly m the face of the world, and she may turn,
as did the Roman matron, to her industrious, tal-
ented, and gallant sons, and as Cornelia did not to
her beautiful and virtuous daughters, exclaiming,
"These are my jewels" While these remain to
her she can nevei be ruined, never justly complain
that she is unhappy

I am soiry to see our loans b^gin at so exorbi-
tant an interest And yet, even at that, -you will
soo i be at the bottom of the loan bag We are an
agricultural na'ion Such an one enplo>s its
spanngs m the puicha^e or improvement oí Ian Is
or stocks The Iendable monpv among them is
chiefly that of orphans and wards m tne hands of
executors and guardians, and thatwhicn the larmer
lays by till he has enough for the purchase in view
In such a nation there is ons, and one only, re-
source for loans sufficient to carry them through
th^ expense oí a war, and that will always be suf-
ficient, and in the power oí an honest Government,
punctual m the preservation of its faith The fund
I mean is Ihe mass of arcxdatm^ com livery one
knows that, although not liteiilh,U s nearly tine,
that every pap°r dollar emnled ban shes a sih ei one
from the circulation A nation, theiefore, nuking
its purchases and pajments with bills fined for cir-
culation, thrusts an equal sum of com out of cucu-
lation This is equivalent to borrowing that sum,
and yet the vender, receiving payment in a medium
as effectual as com for his puichases or payments,
has no claim to interest And so the nation may
continue to issue its bills as far as its want* require,
and the limits of the circulation will admit Those
limits aie understood to extend with us, at present,
to two hundred millions of dollars—a greater sum
than would 1 e neeessarv foi anj u  i But this,
the onlv resource which Ihe Govcinmcn could
command with certainty, ihe States have unfortu-
nately fooled araj, nay conuptly alienated, to
swindlers and shavers, under the covpr of private
banks Say, too, "as an additional evil, that tha
disposable funds of individuals, to this great
amount, have thus been withdrawn from improve-
ment and useful enterprise, and employed in the
useless, usurious and demoralizing piactces of
bank directors and their accomplices In ihe war
of 1755, our State availed itself of this iund by is-
suing a papel mone}, bottomed on a specific tax
for its redemption, and, to insure its credit, bearing
an inteiest of five per cent Withm a very short
time, not a bill of this emission w as to be found tn
circulation It was locked up in the chests of ex-
ecutors, guardians, widows, fanners, &,c We then
issued bills, bottomed on a redeeming tax, but
beaung no interest These were readily received,
and never depreciated a sngle farthing In the
revolutionary war, the i Id Congress and the States
issued bills without interest and witnout tax They
occupied the channels ol circulation very freelv., till
those channels were overflowed by an excels be-
yond all the calls of cuculation But, although vi o
llave so improvidently suffered the field of encu-
Jatmg medium to be filched from us by pnvate in-
dividuals, jet I think we mav recovei it in part,
and even m the whole, if the States will co operate
Tarith us If Tieasury bills are emitted, o i a tax
appropriated for their ledemption in filtecn vears,
and (to insure preference m the first moments of
competition) beaung an mteiest of six p°i cent ,
there is no one who would not take them in prefer-
ence to the bank paper now afloat, on a principle
of patriotism as well as interest, and thev would
b$ withdrawn from. cuculat(on into private hoaids
° a, c°nsid rable amount    Their credit once esta-
blished, others might be emitted, bottomed also on
a tax, but not bearing interest, and, if ever their
credit faltered, open public loans, on which these
bills alone should be received as specie.   These,
opeiatmg as a sinking fund, would  leduce the
quantity m circulation,so as to maintain that in an
equilibrium with specie     It is not easy to estimate
the obstacles which, m the beginning, we should
encounter in ousting the banks from their posses-
sion of the circulation , but a steady and judicious
alternation of emissions and loans would leduce
them in time     Eut, whde this is going on, anothei
measure should be pressed, to recover ultimately
oui right to the cuculation     The Sta'es should be
applied to, to transfer the right of issuing c >-eu
latmg piper to Congiess exclusively, mpetpeluum,
if possible, but during the war at least, with a sav-
ing of chi>\er rights     I believe that ever} Sta'e
west ind south of C<   necficut nver except Dela-
ware   vuiid  immediately do it, and the others
wouli follow >n time     Congress would ofcomse,
begin bv obiic ig unchartered banks to wind     n
their aff irs within a short tune  and t ie othcu „s
then chpneis exia  1, iorhndiig 'he  subsequent
c rcuMion of tie i pi pa    This hey would supph
with their ovn, bottomed, e        emission, on an
a lemiate ta\, -nd bearing, or ir> baaing, intere t
as the state or tne public pulse should indie ite
Vven  in   the non-complying States,  these   bills
« ould make their w aj, and supplant the unfu ided
paper of their banks, by tier sohdilv, by the um-
vfisahtv of their curitncy, and by therr receiva-
bihtv foi enstens and taxe<=    It would be in their
powei, too, to curtail those banks to the amount of
then actual specie, by galheung up then paper,
and running it constantly on them    The nrtional
p per might th is takj place even m the non-com-
pi} ing States     In this wa},I am not without a
hope that this great, this sole lesource for loans in
f an agricultural countrv, might }el be recovered for
the use of the nation during war, and, if obtained
inpeipeluum, it would always b" sufficient to carry
ua through any war    provided that, in the in ten al
between war and war, all the outstanding paper
should be called in, com be permitted to flow in
again, and to hold the field of circulation until
another nai should íequire its }ieldmg place dgam
to the national medium
But, nwill be asked, are we to have no banks 1
Are merchants and others to be depuved cf the
resource of shoit "ecnmmodations, found so con-
venient t I ansu i, 1 t us ha-ve banks, bin let
them be such as ire alone to he found in an\ o iuo-
trv on earth, exc°pt Great Butam There is not a
bank of discount on the continentof Euiope (at least
there was not one when I was there) which offers
any thing but cish m exchange for discounted bills
No one has a natural right to the trade of a monev -
lender, but he who has the money to lend Let
those, tl en, among us who have a moneved capi-
tal and who prefer employ ing it in lc ans rather
than otherw se, set up banks, and give cash or na-
tional bills for the no'e  the} discount Peinaps,
to encourage them a larger interest than is legal in
the other cases might be allowed them, on the con
dition of their lending foi she rt periods only It is
from Great Britain we c< p} the idea of giving pa-
per in exchange fci discounted bills, and, while
w e have del i ved from that country some good prin-
ciples of government and legislation, we unfoitu-
nately run into the mrst servile imitation of all h~r
practices, luinous as the} prove to hei, and with

"mission of bank paper has banished all hei specie,
