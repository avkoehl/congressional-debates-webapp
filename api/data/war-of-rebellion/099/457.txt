HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,February 17, 1865-5 a.m.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: The Third brigade is now crossing over the river in boats. There are some 200 of our troops now on the opposite shore. They are throwing up works to protect the crossing. As soon as the balance of the brigade is over Colonel Stone will immediately move on to Columbia. His brigade will scarcely be able to get started from the other side before daylight.

By order of Brevet Major-General Woods:

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that at 3 o'clock this morning I began crossing the Third Brigade of my division (Colonel Stone commanding) over the Broad River, using three pontoon boats for the purpose. The process was so difficult that it was 7 o'clock before the brigade reached the opposite shore. Passing through the swamps, with skirmishers well thrown forward, the brigade soon reached the high land, and at once took position on a range of hills oooking toward the city. The opposition was but slight. The city soon surrendering, Colonel Stone moved forward and occupied the place, the remainder of my division following as soon as the pontoon bridge was laid. I moved beyond the city, encamping on the east side of the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad, facing eastward. The troops first entering Columbia were met on the roadside by citizens of every grade, who most unwisely furnished them with great quantities of intoxicating liqoors, bringing it out in buckets, cups, and vessels of all description. As a result the confusion prevailing throughout the town was increased tenfold, and at night, in obedience to the direction of the corps commander, the brigade on duty as guards in the town was relieved by the First Brigade, commanded by Brevet Brigadier-General Woods, and every practicable measure was promptly adopted to prevent the spreading of the conflagration that was rapidly extending over the entire town and to arrest the countelss villains of every command that were roamaing over the streets. As strong patrols as could be furnished by the brigade were distributed throughout the town. My headquarters are at the house of Mr. Stark, at the east end of Senate street.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
