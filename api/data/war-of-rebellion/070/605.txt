Colonel Northcott to turn over to that camp all unarmed and dismounted men as rapidly as he may be advised by Major Thorp that he has either arms or horses for them. Until then they can be serviceable doing fatigue duty. Lieutenant- Colonel Northcott has certainly cleared the town of all squads of men and horses, which other officers failed to do.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. P. MAULSBY,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

CUMBERLAND, June 7, 1864.

Colonel T. M. HARRIS,

Beverly:

Your letter received. Hunter and Crook are expected to form a junction at Staunton to- day. I am not advised whether Crook left a force to hold Lewisburg or not. Will advise you as soon as I ascertain. Captain Hart, with a detachment of the Ringgold Cavalry, had a fight with McNeill and Harness yesterday near Moorefield. Had 4 men killed and 6 wounded. Drove the enemy t the mountains. Am much pleased with your policy. Keep your command active, and the enemy will give you a wide berth.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier- General.

All right with Grant and Sherman.

CUMBERLAND, June 7, 1864.

Advise me when the detachment moves by Seneca route. Send a guide with them.
