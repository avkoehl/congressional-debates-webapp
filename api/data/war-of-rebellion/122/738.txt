WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, December 11, 1861.

Honorable A. G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:

How many arms and what kind are required to complete outfit for Wynkoop's two battalions? They must be content for the present with either carbines or pistols.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., December 11, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Wynkoop will receive his arms to-morrow; the clothing not latter than Saturday. I regret I did not see you, as it would have been agreeable and profitable to have had a conference on military affairs. I wish we could, and had I known you were here would have returned Saturday night from Philadelphia. We send Maxwell fully armed and equipped to-morrow; Gregory from Philadelphia unarmed. A regiment will leave Friday fully armed and equipped. That leaves us two in Camp Curtin with 450 and 660 men. Will soon fill them with detached companies. The James brigade is toll of trouble, but as he will be here to-night we will get the men off. Have telegraphed McCalla [McAllen?] to come down.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania.

HARRISBURG, PA., December 11, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Captain Dodge refuses to muster in officers of regiments as I indicate, and I understand him to say he will be the judge of when consolidation is made. Is he not mistaken in the character of his instruction?

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

December 11, 1861.

Governor A. G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Where regiments are full, Captain Dodge will muster in officers indicated by you; but it is the desire of the Department, and Captain Doge is so instructed, not to receive into service officers who have not full commands.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
