Continuing our march uninterruptedly the brigade crossed the Marmiton at 10 o'clock of the night of the 25th, where I halted one hour to burn the train as directed, and moved on in a southerly direction and encamped near Carthage, Mo., on the 26th. The distance traveled in this march was ninety-two miles. The brigade was not again engaged with the enemy, but endured the severest privations and sufferings during the march through Indian Territory to Boggy Depot, which place we reached on the 18th of November. For twenty-five days our animals were without forage. For twenty-three days we subsisted on beef without salt, frequently issued in insufficient quantities, and for three days were without food at all. The loss in animals was very heavy, and many wagons were abandoned in consequence.

For a report of the killed and wounded of the brigade in the actions in which I commanded it and of my own regiment during the expedition, I beg respectfully to refer you to the accompanying paper, marked A.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLTON GREENE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
