APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
SI
35th Cong....1st Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate U Ho. of Reps.
of $100,000. It took effect on the 1st day of
April last, and is to continue until the 1st of Oc-
tober, 1859, the date of expiration of the contract
for the connccting lines from New York and New
Orleans to Aspinwall. Prior to the 1st of April
last, the price of the isthmus service was regu-
lated by the weight of the mails, the law author-
izing the payment of twenty-two cents a pound;
and at that rate the cost of the service for the
year ended 31st March last was $160,321, being
$60,321 a year more than is now paid under the
contract.
The original contractors on the New Orleans
and Vera Cruz line having abandoned the service,
I made a temporary contract with Mr. C. K.
Garrison for semi-monthly trips on the line at
$1,210 93 the voyage, or $29,062 32 a year.
This is the same rate of compensation paid the
old contractors, who, although their contract
called for three trips a month, never performed
but two. The present contract will expire on
the 30 th June next, the date fixed for the expira-
tion of the original contract.
By its terms, the contract with the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, for semi-monthly service
from Astoria, bySan Francisco, &c., to Panama,
expires on the 1st of October, 1858, while, under
the decision of the Navy Department, the con-
tract of the connecting lines on this side runs until
1st October, 1859. Therefore, to keep up the
connection with the Pacific line, as provided by
law, and as originally contemplated, it will be
necessary to extend the contract on the Pacific
one year; and as the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company have performed their service generally
in a highly creditable and satisfactory manner, X
cheerfully recommend an appropriation for such
extension.
The aggregate amount of postages (sea, inland,
and foreign) on ma'ls transported during the year
by the steamers of the New York and Liver-
pool (Collins) line was $210,463 03, which is a
heavy decrease as compared with the amount
($461,575 94) of the previous fiscal year. It
should be observed, however, that the additional
allowance to this line, authorized by the act of
21st Julv, 1852, having been terminated on the
20th of February, 1857, and six yearly trips dis-
pensed with from and after that date, twenty
round trips only, instead of twenty-six, as for-
merly, were performed during the year.
The postages upon mails conveyed by the New
York and Bremen line were $137,754 78, and by
the New York and Havre line $97,950 05; being
a decrease of $5,491 74 by the Bremen, owing to
the fact that much of the time there have been
several foreign steamers running and carrying
ship letters on this line; and an increase of
$2,125 02 by the Havre line, as compared with
the fiscal year ended 30th June, 1856.
The amount of letter postages upon mails
exchanged daring the year with Great Britain
was$874,194 75; Prussia,$326,872 57; Bremen,
$53,082 99; Prance, (from 1st April to 30th June,
1857,) $41,188 19; Hamburg, $1,053 60; being
a decrease on British mails of $23,453 95, on
Bremen mails of $3,706 86, and an increase on
Prussian closed mails of $27,406 86, compared
with the preceding year.
Of the amount of postages on mails exchanged
with Great Britain, $574,194 75 was collected in
the United States, and $300,133 30 in Great
Britain; the excess of United States and British
postages thus collected in the United States
being $274,061 45. In like manner, an excess of
$95,397 95 of the postages upon mails exchanged
with Prussia, and of $32,494 15 on mails ex-
changed with Bremen, was collected in this coun-
try.
The gross amount of United States postage,
sea and inland, on mails transported during the
year, was:
By the Collins line, (20 round trips,) $189,456 61
By the Bremen line, (12 round trips,)  124,193 81
By the Havre line, (12 round trips,)  90,012 47
The ocean postage upon mails conveyed by the Collins
line amounted to $154,545 93
By the Bremen line  84,231 19
By the Havre line  73,716 37
The following statistics will exhibit the opera-
tion of the United States and British postal treaty

It will be seen that the excess of British postage
alone collected in the United States is very con-
siderable, amounting the last year to $193,287 47.
This, as explained in previous reports, results
disadvantageously to this Department, inasmuch
as its postmasters are paid commissions for col-
lecting. Its expenses the last year on this account
have been not less than $75,000. _ The large
increase in the excess of last year arises mainly
from the circumstance that nearly two thirds of
the transatlantic mails have been conveyed by
the Cunaid line of British mail packcts, ana,
when thus conveyed, nearly four fifths of the
postage goes to the British Government, saying
nothing of the still greater proportion it receives
on mails so conveyed for countries beyond Eng-
land. In the final settlement, too, it will be
observed that, the balance is every year largely
against the United States; and that, for the year
ending 30th June last, it reached the sum of
$264,(J18. A partofthis,however, to wit: $43,501,
has been received back in the balance paid to the
United States, on final adjustment, by the Prus-
sian office, thus reducing our indebtedness to
$221,417. Under the arrangement with Prussia,
the balance isin favor of this Department, because
