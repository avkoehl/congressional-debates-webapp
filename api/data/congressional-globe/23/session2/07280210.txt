February 7,
..he second time as in Committee of the Whole,
when,   after   some   remarks   between   Messrs   |
SMITH,LEIGH, WHITE,HILL, and KING,
the bill was ordeied to be engrossed for a third
reading
Mr POINDEXTER, from the Committee on
Public Lands, to which was referred the petition
of H H Hall, relative to the location of Virginia
military land wanants, repo-ted unfavorable upon
the same, and the committee were discharged from
the further consideiation of the subject
Mr POINDEXTER, from the same commit-

di8chaiged from the fuilher consideration of the
subject                                                                           '
Mr LEIGH, from the Committee on Revolu- |
tionary Claims, reported a bill for the relief of j
Sally Springer and others, legal representatives of j
Colonel William Crawfoid, deceased, which was
read the fust time, and oideied to a second lead
ing
BILL TO REORGANIZE THE PJST OrFICE
DEPARTMENT.
On mo'ionofMr E WING, the Senate resumed
the consideration of the bill changing the organi-
zation  of  the  General   Post Office,  when   Mi
CALHOUN withdiew the amendment he sub
mit ed yesteiday
Mr EWING moved to amend the bill by
striking out £,4 000, the compensation given to the
Commissioner, and inserting §3,500
Mi   WRIGHT moved to amend the amend
ment by redui ing the salary to |3,000 pei annum
Mr WRIGHT said he was desirous, of putting
this officer on the same giade, as legirded the
salary, with the Auditors of the Tieasuiy, and he
saw no reason for the distinction between them
The salary was quite suffi lent, and it must be
perceived by Senatois that the time was veiy near
when all the Auditors would be put on the same
footing
Mr   Wi ight's pioposition was agreed to
Seveial unimportant amendments were then
made to the second, third, fourth, and fifth sec
lions, when
Mr EWING moved an amendment, requn ing
the books in the Gereral Post Offi e, nppiopn
ately belonging to the Commissioner's office, to be
delivered up to that officer on the 10 h of March
next, and requiring the Postmaster Geneial to
" deliver to the Solicitor all books and papéis in
' the Post Office, or copies or extracts therefiom
' relative to suits brought, and a statement of all
' matters in suit and all judgments remaining
' unsatisfied," which were agreed to
The 12 h section prohibits any additional com
pensauou fiom being made tonny mailcontiactor
tor additional services in carrying the mail upon
any mail jott/e, so as to increase the compensation
to more than double the net amount of postages
received on the route, &C
Mi EWING moved to amend this section by
inseiting after the word " route," in italics, these
words " which shall have been established for
ten  5 ears before the execution of his contiact "
Tins amendment was, also agreed to
The 12 h section fuither provides that " when
'any extra service shall be ordered, the amount
'of the allowance therefor, in dollar  and cents,
' shall be signified in the ordei for such service,
' and be forthwith entered upon the books of the
'General Post Office "
Mr CWING moved to add to this, "and no
' additional compensation shall be paid for any
' extra services oideied before the issuing of such
' ordei and the making of such entry," which was
agreed to
Several unimportant amendments were made
in other sections of the oil!, on motion of Mr
EWING, when
Mr. PORTER moved an amendment as an
additional section to the bill," That it shall be the
' duty of the Postmaster General to enter into a
' contract for carrying a daily mail between New
' Orleans and Mobile "
Upon this proposition a discursive debate en-
sued
Mr SOUTHARD opposed it, not because he
was unfavorable to a daily mall between Mobile
and New Orleans, for he thought there ought to
be one transported there But hi" difficulty was
in selecting any particular route where there should
be a dally mail carried, and introducing it into this
bill He thought it ought to be incorporated in a
particular bill, and unless this was a very gnev
ous case, he would be opposed to it
Mr PORTER admitted there was «ome incon-
gruity in incorporating a provision like this in a
general law, but he hoped the Senate would con
sent to mtioducmg it when hisieaso is were heard
If the subject had been left to the Postmaster
Geneial, to do as he had done for rine months
past, they had nothing else to look for but con
tmued inteiruption, for, by the bill, no change
could be made in any contiact upon a route which
was of ten year&'standing, and therefore this route
would be cut oil Incongruities should yielc to
general utility and public necessity The mail
was now earned only thiee times a week, and he
believed this interruption was done for the pur-
pose of inducing Louisiana to send Senatois heie
who would suppoit the Postmaster General No
other part of the whole country, it appeared,
coald be selected for making letrenchments upon,
but this one Mi P then recurred, at some
length, to the Pieaident's letter to the people of
New Orleans, and the allusions made therein to
himself and his colleague When Mr P con-
cluded,
Mr LINN said, if the amendment should pass,
and he was not in favor of it, he would then pro
pose anothei to cairy the mail daily1 fiom Louis-
ville to St Lorn —he did not wish to embarrass
the bill, but if this passed he would feel it his
duty to offer the one he suggested
Mr WAGGAMAN said the honorable gentle-
man had not taken a just view of this amendment
New Oileans was the only commercial phcewhich
had been made the victim of the curtailment of
the expenses of the Post Office Department The
impoitant commercial relations of that city made
it indispensable that a regulai daily mail should
be kept up The exports fiom thatcity alone, in
1835, would be ¡>50,000 000, and in ten years it
would bi doubled This fact would present to
the Senate the necessity of an unrestrained daily
inteicouise between that city and theNorth This
was the object of his colleague's unendment, and
it occuned to him that New Orleans should be
made an exception He was willing that St
Louis should have equal privileges, if it had as
impeiatne claims The necessity of a daily mail
from Mobile to New Oileans was self evident
The amount of postages which weie taken in the
la'ter city was about $46 000, while $,40,000 only
was estimated to be sufficient foi the tiansporta
Hon of the mail Why not giant it then ' They
asked nothing umeesonable, but only that what
they paid inio the Treasuiy might be appropri-
ated for their use
Mi BIBB said he should vote for the proposi
tion, notwithstanding the objection of the honora-
blegentleman from New Jersey, [Mr Southírd ]
Mail routes were established by Congiess,and the
q íestion now wis, whether, if it v/as manifestly
propel that the mail should be transported a cei-
tain number of times on a particular route, it was
the duty of Congress so to direct He thought it
was Could theie be any more doubt thata daily
mail was as ne< essary between Mobile and New
Oileans as between the seat of Government and
New Orleins,and between Washington and New
York or P! iladelphia > If it wis self-evident that
it was impoitant to have a daily communication
between New York and New Orleans, and th 
Postmas ei General would not establish it, ought
it not to oe done' It was said he would notestab
lish it, but that it was only tri weekly Then he
thought a provision for the purpose ought to be
introduced into this bill, and he would go for any
other similar proposmon where the propriety of
it was ns manifest as this was
Mr GRUNDY remarked that, having given his
opinions very fully yesterday, he would not say
anything to day on the general topics connected
with this biir But if theie had been any person
more consistent than another in favor of this mail
being carried dany he was that man He akvaya
was in favor of it, and reported favorably upon it
last year He thought there should be a regular
daily mail between New Oileans and the eastern
States But such a cáseas thib nevei had occui red
m our legislation before Congress had never yet
said when and bow the mail should be conveyed
fiom place to place He believed there was one
instance in which Congress had authorized the
employment of a steamboat for that purpose He
was very unwilling to see this special kind of
legislation The object was certainly a desirable
one, but if this proposition was agreed to, the
honorable gentleman from Missouri would also
make out his case, and perhaps a veiy strong one,
and how could you refuse it? And another and
another would then be presented, and how could
you refuse the accommodation ' Let this be estab-
lished as a precedent, and other applications would
be irresistible It would also be trenching upon
one of the great principles of this bill, which re-
quired the Postmaster General not to extend the
expenditures of the department beyond its reve-
nues And when, by legislating, you encioached
upon this principle, you destioyed his responsi-
bility He agreed that this daily mail was proper,
and ought to be established, but he hoped it would
be done in the ordinary way
Mr SOUTHARD thought it important that
this should be a daily mail íoute, and if it could
not be done otherwise Congress ought to dnect it
But we m ght command the Postmaster General,
and still it would no' be done But his difficulty
was that this was not the propei place to introduce
it, it should be inserted in a bill establishing post
routes Such a bill, he had no doubt, would be
passed at this session—there were petitions for it
both heie and in the other House, and it wc uld
be easy to say in that bill that theie should be a
dally mail between Mobile and New Oilcans
He assured the gentlemen from Louisiana that, in
some form or other, he would give them hisuimost
exertions to carry such a proposition thiough
Mr EWING said he agreed with the honor-
able Senatois from Louisnna, that a daily mail
between New Oileans and Mobil  was high'y
necessary And he also agreed with the other
Senatois, [Viessrs Grundy and Southakd,] that
this bill should not be encumbered with unneces-
sary provisiors There was anothei objection
this bil' must yet pass through the othei House,
where, if it was sent loaded with encumbrances, it
would be impossible to get through this session—
and it w i of the utmost importance that it should
be passed
The question being upon the amendment, Mr
WAGGAMAN asked the yeas and nays, which
were ordered
Mr PRLS TON explained his reasons for voting
againsfthe amendment An important pioposi-
tion (said Mi P ) had been but yesterday with-
diawn to pi event everything unnecebsary from
being mcoiporated in the bill, and he was opposed
to this amendment on the same ground
The question was then put, and decided in the
negative—yeas 8  nays 33, as follows
YEAS—Messrs Bibb, Black,Mangum,Moore,
Pomdexter  Porter, Robbins, and Waggaman—8
NAYS-Messrs Bell Brown, Buchanan Cuth-
bert, Ewmg, Frelinghuvsen, Goldsborough,
Giundy, Hendricks, Hill, Kane, Kent, King of
Alabama, King of Georgia, Knight, Leigh, Ln n,
McKean, Morris, Naudain, Prentiss, Preston,
Robinson, Ruggles, She[ ley, Smith, Southaid,
Swift, Tallmadge, Tipton, Tomlmson, White,
and Wright—33
Several other unimportant amendments weie
then made, so as to conform to others inserted in
theexamination of the bill, andit was then repoited
to the Senate as amended
The question being then put on all the amend-
ments col'ec'ively, they were agreed to
Mi KING, of Georgia, then moved further to
amend the bill in that part which prescribes the
mode of letting contracts His proposition was
that proposals should be handed in sealed, which
should then be regularly numbered, and when
opened it should be done in presence of the bid-
