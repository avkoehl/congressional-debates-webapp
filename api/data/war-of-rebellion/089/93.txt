CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,

October 6, 1864.

An officer from these headquarters, who was on the line to-day,m reports that about 3.30 flags of truce were flying from the enemy's line and from ours, two being in the vicinity of Fort Rice on the old line of works. The general does not object to cessation of picket-firing or informal truce for temporary purposes, but objects to the display of flags as described, except by authority, and requests that you will give the necessary instructions to your officers to put an end to this irregularity. If the enemy's pickets and vedettes wish a cessation of the firing they can indicate it by ceasing to fire and not by resort to flags. If they continue to use them, the general does not wish the example imitated.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
