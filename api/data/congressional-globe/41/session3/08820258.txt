APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Ho. of Keps.
The Indians—Mr. Armstrong.
41st Cong....3d Sess.
September, 1870, and on the 20th of Decem-
ber, 1870, adopted what is known as the
" Ocmulgee constitution.'1
It has been the purpose of the committee to
conform this bill to that constitution, so far as it
could bo done without sacrificing any important
interest of the Government.
In the general purpose they agree; but they
differ in two essential particulars, which the
committee believe it is not expedient for the
Government to concede. By the constitution
the Indiana claim the right to elect the Gov-
ernor, and do not recognize the right of Con-
gress to supervise their legislation. In both
particulars the constitution goes far beyond
th ir treaties. To concede these prerogatives
would be to set up an anomalous State, with
rights unknown to any other territorial govern-
ment, not conducing to any substantial inter-
est to the tribes, and which, in their practical
operations, would cut thein off from Govern-
ment control and leave them exposed to the
dangers which must inevitably beset their legis-
lation, as well from individuals as powerful
corporations, whose interests were opposed to
theirs. Its tendency would be to keep alive
tribal distinctions, jealousies, and disputes.
Our policy should lopk to the ultimate consol-
idation of the tribes, their union as one people,
and their final incorporation into the Union as
a State.
Under their several treaties they claim
exemption alike from State and Federal tax-
ation, and these claims are recognized. The
internal revenue law$ are not extended over
them. The State of New York has been
denied the right to tax Indians within^ her
limits; and, following a long line of decisions,
the State of Kansas has been denied the right
to tax the Indians there. The law has been
distinctly so held by the Supreme Court of the
United States as late as 18G0, in ths cases

It is not, in my judgment, a wise policy to
organize this Territory with such extended
privileges as leave to them nothing to be
desired in the organization of a State. Such
privileges are not conceded by treaty, and I
believe them to be equally inconsistent with
the maintenance of proper control over our
territorial governments and with the best inter-
ests of the Indians.
The Committees on Indian Affairs and the
Territories are unanimous in recommending
to the House that the government to be estab-
lished shall conform iu its general character
to other territorial governments. The bill
framed with this intent directs that the Gov-
ernor and the secretary, who in his absence or
disability may become Governor, shall be ap-
pointed by the President, with tbe advice and
consent of the Senate. It asserts the ordinary
right of supervision by Congress over territo-
rial legislation. It provides for the appoint-
ment, in the usual manner, of the judges of
the United States courts, leaving, however,
to the Territory the right to establish a local
judiciary. It does not interfere with the local
interests of the Territory, nor with the tribal
organizations within it.
The name " Oklahoma" means " home of the
red man," and is adopted pursuant to the treaty
with the Choctaws and Chickasaws of 186G, in
which this name is expressly provided.
The territory embraced in this bill comprises,
as nearly as can be ascertained, 41,691,186
acres, or 65,142 square miles. It is bounded
on the north by the southern boundary of the
State of Kansas, on the west by the eastern
boundary of the Territory of New Mexico and
the State of Texas, on the south by the north-
ern boundary of the State of Texas, and on the
east by the western boundary of the States of
Arkansas and Missouri. There is at present
within it a population of about 70.369 Indians.
The following table, prepared in the Indian
department, gives the territory and population
by tribes, as accurately as they can be ascer-
tained. It includes such negroes and whites as
have attained citizenship in the several tribes:

In this connection I thought it desirable to
compare the total number of Indians in the
United States and the quantity of land covered
by Indian reservations. For this purpose the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs has furnished,
at my request, the following valuable table,
compiled from the latest statistics of tbe De-
partment, and which, with the permission of
the House, I will print with my remarks:
