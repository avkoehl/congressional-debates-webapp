THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Mr.
Chairman 
Mr. WOOD. I cannot be interrupted any
further.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I rise to
a question of order. _ •
Mr. WOOD. Well, sir, state your point
of order.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I will.
My point of order is, that I am unable to see
what the expenditures of the War Department
from money acquired outside of the appropri-
ations of Congress have to do with the tariff.
Mr. WOOD. Well, sir, I will tell the gen
tleman.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules
the point of order.
Mr. WOOD. I will show the gentleman
the pertinency of this discussion, if he has
not intelligence enough to see it without an
explanation.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I really
do not see that it has anything to do with the
question before us.
Mr. WOOD. I am endeavoring to show how
much money should be voted by Congress in
order that we may ascertain how much tariff
we should impose oil bunting or any special
article in which the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has peculiar interest.
Now, sir, 1 propose to resume my remarks.
I am willing to waive all this. For the pur-
pose of reaching aconclusion as totheamount
of money required. I will assume that every
man connected with this Administration is
perfectly conscientious, loyal, patriotic, and
honest, and that there is no money in the Treas-
ury which can be used to meet the necessary
expenditures for the next fiscal year.
But, assuming that the amounts asked for
should be appropriated by Congress, I pro-
ceed to show the source whence it is to be pro-
cured. We require, as stated, $301,705,036 99.
Let us see how to provide it.
RECEIPTS.
The Secretary of the Treasury furnished
me with a statement of the receipts from all
sources for the first eight months, or two
thirds of the present fiscal year ending
March 1, 1872, presented by me to the House
on the 13th of that month. It is as follows :
From all sources  $250,504,988 59
Balance of year, estimated at same
ratio  125,254,994 29
Total  375,764,982 88
Deduct estimates    301,705,036 99
Balance  $74,059,945 89
To this amount should be added at least
$100,000,000 out of the cash kept continually
on hand in the Treasury, in disregard of the
public interest.
Mr. DAWES. I dislike to interrupt the
gentleman further.
Mr. WOOD. I cannot yield.
Mr. DAWES. I want to call the gentle-
man's attention to the fact that 
Mr. WOOD. I will anticipate what the gen-
tleman is going to say. I know that the Sec-
retary has recently put forth a statement that
black is white, attempting to prove that he
keeps this money there because he may
at some time or other be called upon to use
some of it. I know he says that he keeps
$80,000,000 of gold certificates permanently
outstanding——■
Mr. DAWES. Thirty-three million dollars.
Mr. WOOD. I know he says he keeps those
certificates outstanding to meet obligations
which are no more likely to be presented than
'his building is liable to fall before night.
Yet he keeps that money stowed away in the
public Treasury to provide for some contin-
gency that may never arise.
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman ignores the
fact that $26,000,000 are required for coin
interest due, $33,000,000 for coin certificates,
and $50,000,000 to meet called bonds, making
an aggregate of $109,000,000.
Mr. WOOD. I know the Secretary says he
must hold a part of this to provide for the
interest on the public debt which falls due the
1st of July. He has been for six months
keeping it in his strong box to meet the inter-
est on the public debt which is not due until
the 1st of July! How absurd! While he is
in receipt, in gold, of duties on imports into
the country and of $500,000 which come into
this city every day from internal taxation, he
is in receipt of large sums of money enough
to warrant him in keeping no reserve balance,
because the daily accruing receipts are suffi-
cient to protect him in any possible difficulty
or contingency. Nevertheless he has had at
a time in the Treasury §133,000,000 in coin
and $26,000,000 in currency.
Instead of raising large sums by hard ex-
actions upon the people, by putting our hands
violently into their pockets and taking from
them their hard earnings—I say, instead of
doing that, let us take $100,000,000 of the
cash reserve in the Treasury and pay it out in
disbursements for the maintenance of the Gov-
ernment, or buy up to that extent our out-
standing obligations, and to that extent lower
taxation. Tnat, Mr. Chairman, would be my
policy, and I submit, with all respect, ought to
be the policy of the Government. Although
the Government is in debt to the amount of
twenty-three to twenty-five hundred million
dollars, yet we are hawking our credit in
Europe, and still inflicting enormous and bur-
densome taxation upon the people, and yet we
have $140,000,000 in the Treasury drawingno
interest whatever. Why should we continue
to pursue any such policy ?
1 say we have $75,000,000 more than we
require. The chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means told me the other day that he
was in favor of the reduction of $12,893,000
on the internal taxation. I am sorry he will
not go further. I will go much further.
Mr. DAWES. When did I say that?
Mr. WOOD. In a paper you read to the
House last week as reported in the Globe.
Mr. DAWES. I beg pardon. The gentle-
man has looked at it, and of course must know;
but I will say now what I will do. I would,
if I could have my own way, strip internal
revenue off of everything except the tax on
tobacco and on spirituous liquors.
Mr. WOOD. I agree with the gentleman
fully. But I would go much further. I would
vote to abolish the Internal Revenue Bureau
altogether. In the better days of the Repub-
lic we had no such system. Imposts defrayed
the expenses of the Government. This inter-
nal revenue taxation system is a child of the
Republican party. It is unjust, inquisitorial,
and in my judgment unconstitutional. But
we will take any reduction we can get from
any source whatever.
It will be seen that there is a balance of
nearly $75,000,000 to spare from taxation
according to the report ot the Secretary of the
Treasury. The chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means proposes a reduction of
$12,893,123 on the internal taxes. I concur
with him in this, and would be satisfied with
it. Taking, therefore, this reduction from the
$75,000,000, it would leave about$62,000,000
to be taken off the revenue derived from duties.
Having thus determined the amount to be
reduced m the aggregate, the next and great-
est question is as to the particular items upon
which the reduction shall fall. As a general
principle, the reduction should be confined to
those articleswhich directly or indirectly enter
into subsistence or which are of popular con-
sumption. I include in this everything which
is necessary for human life or comfort. In my
judgment this is the just and only correct
principle upon which to legislate in this mat-
ter. It is not a question of making a new
tariff or of adjusting the standard upon which
duties shall be levied in the interests of reve-
nue or protection, direct or indirect, visible
or invisible, but simply one of a reduction of
existing duties so as to obtain all the revenue
wanted without imposing an undue proportion
upon the great body of the people. There are
fifteen or sixteen hundred articles enumerated
in the present tariff as dutiable. Of these a few
contribute nearly the entire revenue. Accord-
ing to the official returns the following articles
produced the sums stated for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1871:
Amount of duty received on fourteen articles for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1871.
Sugar of all kinds .*. $29,690,521 58
Silk, and manufactures of silk  17,965,819 85
Dress goods  14,353.853 38
Iron, and manufactures of iron...  13,766,121 32
Coffee  10,969.098 77
Manufactures ot cotton  10.773,832 48
Spirits and wines    8,432,078 27
Tea  8,322,994 67
Dress and piece goods  7,941,609 77
Flax, and manufactures of flax, linen,
&e  6,475,953 72
Cloths  6,430.226 41
Fruits of all kinds  3,428,097 72
Salt  1,176,857 00
Coal and culm of coal  543,257 88
Total - $140,270,222 77
The whole sum received for the same period
from duties was $206,270,408 05, which shows
how large a proportion was derived from the
articles enumerated in the above table.
Before proceeding to consider the particular
articles which should bear the reduction, I
propose to indulge in some general remarks
pertinent to a consideration of that question.
To legislate on the subject of the tariff at all
is most difficult. The question, when it comes
up in detail, is as multifarious as the inter-
ests to be considered are intricate and compli-
cated. We may determine to have a tariff for
revenue solely, but when we sit down to talk
over the matter in detail, and as to the pre-
cise adjustments for each article, upon this
principle, we may not agree as to what con-
stitutes a revenue standard for one of them.
Again, we are the victims of private interests
without knowing it. The man who is inter-
ested in the importation of a particular arti-
cle will cry lustily for free trade, which means
that he is in favor of admitting, at little or no
duty, the goods or wares he imports or uses,
so that he can increase his profits. Thus
the importers of or those who use foreign
iron favor low duties on this article, and
instruct us accordingly. So with cutlery and
woolens, and othar manufactures of foreign
production. On the other hand, the home
manufacturer, whose want of skill or capital,
or other disadvantages, prevents him from
competing with the foreign article, asks for
protection. He talks of American manufac-
tur4&*home industries, favoring the interests
of our own country against the " pauperlabor"
of Europe, &c. He also wants tariff legisla-
tion favoring the particular interest he repre-
sents, not caring much for any other indus-
tries, whether American or foreign, but the
one out of which he wants to make money.
Both - sides, therefore, are actuated by purely
selfish and personal considerations, and each
individual connected with either side in the
general contest, as between free trade and
protection, struggles for himself and that par-
ticular employment or business in which his
personal advantage is to be promoted.
Astute dogmas are enunciated, giving im-
possible theories and any quantity of false
facts, based upon misapplied figures, to show
exactly how the case stands, and expressing
great disgust with the want of intelligence
upon the part of the people generally, and
Congressmen especially, with the subject of
tariff legislation, and the real workings of the
"visible" and " invisible:' protection from i>n
Atkiusonian, Wellstonian, or Greeleyonian
pinnacle of superhuman intelligence. Nor
is this kind of discussion the only sort of
effort we have. There is another power at
work for and against free trade in the daily
and weekly press. Some of them are actu-
ated by political or party motives, others by
