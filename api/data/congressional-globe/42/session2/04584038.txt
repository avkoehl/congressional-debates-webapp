SAM. HAMBLETON,
Managers on the part of the House.
Mr. STEWART. This bill was read at night
without a quorum being present and subse-
quently passed. It is so radical in its nature,
changing the whole system of safeguards, if
there be any, for the protection of life and
property on board of steamboats and steam-
ships, that 1 feel called upon to ask that the
bill be read in full with the amend oents made
by the committee of conference, with a quo-
rum present in the Senate, so that we can see
what it is. Nobody can tell anything about it
by this report of the amendments according to
their numbers. The changes made in the
steamboat laws are of so radical a nature that
I feel called upon to insist on the reading of
the bill as it will stand under this report. It
is a very important bill, and it ought not to
become a law without being read.
Mr. SPENCER. Each Senator has a copy
of the bill and the report before liiin.
Mr. CHANDLER. The bill has been read
at length heretofore and all the amendments,
and this report has been on the table of Sen-
ators now tor four or five days. The confer-
ence committee spent eight hours the other
night on this bill, and gave it very careful con-
sideration, and I think we have got a very
good bill. Of course it is within the power of
the Senator to call for the reading of it, but it
lies on the desk of every Senator with the
amendments. It has been now four days on
their tables. I hope the Senator will not insist
on occupying the time of the Senate iu read-
ing a bill which has already been read.
Mr. CONKLING. I venture with great
diffidence to differ with the honorable Senator
from Michigan, the chairman of the commit-
tee to which I have the honor to belong, but
I must differ with him when he. says that he
thinks this is an excellent bill. It is a bill
relating to the steamboat interest, a great, and
meritorious interest, very largely represented
in my own Stale, an interest in behalf of
which I should be glad to vote for anything I
could, fostering if. But, sir, the bill relates
also very largely to human life, and 1 ain per-
suaded that the Senate hearing this bill read
will never adopt it. I mean hearing it read
and attending to it, and unless some other
Senator shall do bo 1 shall deem it my duty to
call attention to very many of the provisions
which it contains, and which constrain me to
vote against this report, and to vote against it
by as much as 1 know how dangerous an
element steam is, and by as much as I know
the duty resting upon us to protect human
life.
Now, sir, I am prepared to assign in part at
least my reasons for objecting to it, but it can-
not be done in what is left of the morning
hour.
Mr. CHANDLER. I shall ask the Senate
to proceed with this bill until it is finished.
Mr. CONKLING. I was about to say that
I will Dot delay the consideration of the bill
at any time when it can be deliberately con-
sidered.
Mr. CHANDLER. I hope the Senate will
proceed with it until it is finished.
Mr. CONKLING. My friend knows very
well that the Senate will not do that, because
the taiiff bill is the order at twelve o'clock.
However, I was in the act of assuring him that
I shall never place any impediment iu the way
of its consideration when it can be deliber-
ately considered; but it can never pass with-
out being read and considered. 1 mean to
defer to everybody's wishes, but I mean to
stand by that. This bill shall never become a
law when I am in the Senate, without some
of its provisions being brought to the knowl-
edge of the Senate; for I s>ay that as a law
between )he public and common carriers, it is
bv itself in the whole history of civilized legis-
lation ; there is nothing like it; and I say if
you undertake to apply to railway companies
or to steamboat companies the provisions of
this bill, you might as well repeal all statutory
provisions and remit men to their natural
rights. But I do not want to be led at this
