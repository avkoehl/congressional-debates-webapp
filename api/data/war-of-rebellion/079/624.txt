COLUMBIA, TENN., November 3, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

A lieutenant of the Tenth Tennessee, carrying your order to General Hatch, has just come in from Croxton's command. He reports squads of rebel cavalry in and near Lawrenceburg. They hold the roads between that point that Pulaski turnpike. These squads probably followed Hatch, and are now north of Croxton. The Fifth Iowa has not yet reported here.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Kingston, Ga.:

I reached here this morning with my advance, which has gone forward. One brigade of Cooper's is marching this side of Dalton with my trains; the other two go forward by rail to-day. Trains for Cox will go to Dalton to-night and to-morrow morning. I will start for Nashville this evening.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., November 3, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have received your dispatch of yesterday. The trains, which have already gone to Resaca, will bring all the [troops] there. Mr. Tindall informs me that he can send enough this p. m., to-night, and to-morrow morning, and bring nearly all the remainder, except the brigade which is marching from Dalton with my wagons. The weather and roads are getting bad, so that it is hardly possible for troops to march; but I think we will all get started by rail to-morrow evening. I will go forward myself this afternoon.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
