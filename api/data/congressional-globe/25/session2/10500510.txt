Senate 
dangeious poft ei, that the ciops of executive influence may be
incieased moui elections 7 > ay, God forbid'
I have been zealous loi pulling down the Bank of the United
States, and lor maintaining a sound metallic cunency, n.d, to
do this, believe we uu0ht to sustam, as far as we could, Stale
banks, pievailmg on tnem, by all incidental means in our
power, to cease the ust. of small note , and had hoped we could
have succeeded but specie payments have been suspended,
and the advocates oi l'n-i Jill ¡>av we must tiy some other ex
penment
Divoice, divoice a untulo matrimonii, is. the watclinoiü
wherever youtind a modem democrat
That thfieit> a divoice, a mensa el thai o, ix.stms 1 admit,
but am ol opinion it hat. been pioduced by aulent tempe/ and
want.ot due ca/con the pail oi the 1< tdu at head, and tuo yield
ing and complying a disposition on the pait oi the b inks, and
that the whole might yet be iconciled, at all event  to the ad
vantage of the family
I have heard of cases v. heit, a da&hing hueitme had matued
a wile, attat bed to, and eveiy wav wuithy of him, that he, upon
looking faither mto the woi hi, concluded it heweie fieedliom
his fiist love, ho could be bettci tuted upon a ¡second expen
ment, and, with a view to obt ma divoice, tinew temptations
in his wife's way, which she had not stem vntue enough to ic
sist, she sinned, and then he applied foi a divorce And what
have courts of conscience said in such eases'* Depait hence '
you contributed to your wife ¡a Uaiis¿iet,sion, and shall not pioiit
by youi own iniquity
Apply these punuples to tins cvse When the Executive
wooed and w m the ¡state banks they weie puie and unsullied
Then utmost, cxeitions weie neces¡=aiy to aid in pros latwg the
Hank o i the Lmted states, they were coaxed, almost com man
ded, to extend their loans They did so, to impiudent lengths
The Executive saw and knew this Were they admonish
ed to diminish then discounts'? isever ! So far as I know,
on the contiary, they weie eulogized up to July, 183G, then
came the Lvxeutive denunciation", and they ha\e nevei «ince
ceased   *
The Executive i<= lo blame, so aic the bank-, but, on account
of their quairei, the gieat Aracnean iamily ought not tu be
saenhced
If none weie t> bu miuied but themselves, I ctitamiy should
feel no melnidiiou to m eilcic but I uo think it noiinng but
lUot that both piities slum * luai then due pioportlun ol blame,
and that a sepaiation ou¿)it no,, to be permitted, uri-íei cu
cumstances by which an unoffending co/nmumty mu&tbe the
euffeiers
But again 1 thmk it it isevei piopei to establish thi& system,
and to have this divorce, i owis not the piopei tune
The banks aie state lii&tHutK ns , society have a deep m a est
in their maintaining a ^ouiuli urreney thib can only be done by
lcsuming specie payments, t! is they ne.ei can do until their
credit isle established, while the whole weight of a popuiai
Admimstr ition i¡= against tl em, they can nevei resumt with a
hope of continuing «pecit- payments You separate now, and
why i Because, bay the whole Administration and i bínenos, and
if we pass this bill w e join m the ciy, they aie uow orthy o( credit'
Every man who believes this ¡statement, and has a claim against
them, would apply foi his money, and they would be compelled
immediately to stop again
Take the weight of Jit Federal Government off them, it is now
pressing them into the dust, audwhiu it is upon them, you
might as well order a man whose legs had been cut oft to ¡ui ip
to his feet and wdk, a* to m,uno them u it iimt, with a ht>¡ e
that they can d;> so let then eudit be again it o td, ai d it
we must sepeiate, tí t y could bettci thui, trim now, sustain the

The Tedeul Govern vh r t obt lined the use of then when
their credit w.s good, it bhmi'd be icstoied, and then, ifevei,
tliey ought to be íetuined, in equally good tiedit, to the e\elu

Banks go to excess occasionally, and theic is ttinj orary suf

producer evil when earned to excee* Banks lksue too much
paper, but thai is no i eason they should all be destroyed Over

of some benefits It makes road  and canal" and improve

ment taken place, yet the improvements lcraain for the benefit
of the people at Jiige
What do gentlemen mean ? Do they mean to put us back o
the year eleven huudied, wlun they say banks commenced*
Are we to quit our oidmary business and commence waümj
branches in seaich of golden pebbles, to add to the stock ot oie

that he may melt them, and, with hie  yavmg tools, make us

the more prone are its people to run into eices^ and none so
much as our own What was Gieat Butain before the cu •)
hshment of htrbank1 LiKe other nations who are destitute of
every thing but a specie circulation, poot, unthnity, ai.ti com
mercial    And what is she now 1
We need a larger cnculation than any countiy upon the
earth of the same population because we aie freer than any
other The circulation ought always to bear a due proportion
to all saleable or exchangeable commodities In some oí the
State^every thing is of that description Entails are áe«tt)oyeíl,
allpcopeity, real and personal, is unfettered and for sale when
«ver a man thinks he can bettei him-elf by selling man old and
purchasing in a new State In many States so mush is land
unfettered thatit can be sold m fee simple upon a wiit offiir

btnks <il vay&kel it a favoi confined on them when they can
gctagoodcustomei
Although I speak thut> fieely oí tr-e utility of banks, they
ne\cr have been favorites of mine, but we must have them
Ihe countiy cannot and will not do without them
We must ha\e a Tieatuiy bank, a ba?ik incorporated by
Congress oi State banks And I piefei the last I hey are
thekdst dangerous, and the States have cleaily the power to in
cotpoiate them 'I he States, m granting charléis, can, if they
chojse, guau! generally against excesses" II they weie to di-
lect all profits ovei cix or eight per cent pei annum to go mto
tht "iieabiny, as a school fund, the temptation to shave and
to make excessive loans would be takenaway And ii they
would prohibit standing accommodations, lew bad debts would
be contracted
2d Ihe other object of the bill is to compel oui collectors
and receivers to cease depositing money in banks, and to com
pel them to depestte all moneys in th* hands of officers ap-
pointed by the Preszae?it, and removable at h s pleasure^
there to bt kept till needed foi disbursement I thmk this ai
rangement much worse than to deposite m the banks
1st Beeause the directois and officers ol the banks will be
mme likely tobe faithful than officeis appointed by us The
stockholders w ill alwavb i itend to select those who will be most
likely not to waste then moneys Our officers for some time
ha\ebo"n, aid I co*vndei the system i=¡ to be continued, se
leetedmore with a view to influence m elections than to any
qualified, ions foi the particulai offices they aie to fill Let me
net be misunderstood I do not mean to say that eveiy office
luldei is a mere paUy tool I think theie aie many who are
not But I do mean to state it a«my opinion, that now and for
«ome t me past, the- principal qualification looked for is pvkli
tut influence and such men appointed from such motives, I
thmk will geneially be unsafe depositaries Supposing these
orneéis equally faithiul they will not geneially have pkres as
safe as those piovided ! y banks
Again This plan wiU occasion a gieat increase of expense,
new ofhceifc clerks, vis tere, houses, «afes, vaults, &c There
will he n< effectual check either upon those officers or upondis
bursing officeis It is said there have been m modern tames,
but few lo&ses by defalcations of disbursing officers
One principal if not the sole reason of this is the check upon
them, by ordeung them, whenever their position will enable
i hem to do so to keep their moneys in banks and eveiy week
or month an account is furnished the Secretary of the Treas
uiv by the deposite bank, showing tht sums deposited and by
whom Trm furnishes «?tion°" reasons a°-i.ms.t using or loaning
i )o icy , immediate detection would be the cons quence
Ii ml i th< pioposed «ystem this check í^entnely íemoved,
and the public money wili, in many cases be misused

done m one ea^e by an officer m who«e mtegnty I once had
unlimited confidence lie collected a large claim fiom ore
debtui to the Government and immediately loaned the amount
received to some political friend^ not only without authority,
butoontiaiy to his instructions, and at 1 his moment, two suns
are pending against these new debtors^ who have refused to
pay their notes as they fell due If I mistake not, one of the
parties to this veiy tiansacuon has been appointed to, and now
h dds an office which will make mm a sub Tieasurei if this bill
should pas 
A bank in nr- own State has been alluded to in a letter read
by the Senator fiom Missouri, which he has received from the
late Chief Md_it>u\ite
A biief íeviewnflhe histmy of that bank and matteiscon
ncctcd with it m iy be of use to us on the subject under consid
eiation
The act estabh hirg that bank was passed at a called session
in the yeai 1620 The chart ei oí the Uiited States Bank was
pa* edmlSie at d the bank went into actual operation the 1st
oi January Iil7
It wps an Administration measuie and wren the bill was
before i t ner^ the Repie=entative from my distuct sent me a
copy ol it wi h a request that I would give him my opinion of
its provsionp which I did in a piem lengthv letter That
opinion was \eiv decidedly agarns' the bill, and the opinion I
then foimed and expiesped I have ever since entatamed, and
still entertain He alone, from Tenne=*ee, as I believe, voted
against the bill Tor tins vote he was attacked at home, and I
feltm duty hound to maintain him as well as I could This
biought me in direct conflict with me friends of the United
States Bank as early as 1316
Soon affpr the bank went into operation it established
branches m Kentucky and before the fall of 1817, many of the
loan** nift made had fallen due, and payment was exacted To
this the ptoplt had net been accustomed and, as is always the
case, althoueh the bank haetbeen popuiai when making loans,
U =;oon became 'verv unpopular when trying to collect its debts
Stories of the rum us opeiattonsofthe bank in Kentucky
««ion ieachcdi)« in Tennes&ee, and in the autumn of 1817, with a
view to save Tennessee fiom thehke oppression, her Legisla
ture pasW an act, a<51 believe, unanimously, imposing a very
heavy tax, say sixtj. thou and dolldts upon any persons at
tempting to bank m Tennessee without authority from the
State
A few years since, while the controversy was going on with
the Bank of the United States the Senate created a committee.
of which Mr Tyler, of Vngmia, was a member, to examine
into its proceedings and when they made their report foi the
fir-t time I found a letter dated in 1818, now bound up in our
documente, soliciting the Fiesidentof the bank to establish a
branch in Nashville, notwithstanding the act of Assembly,
informing him that the act was passed by contracted, illiberal
men, and after furnishing a hot oi names for directors, assuring
mm that if a branch was established and directors appointed
from the list, he would see that a good account should be given
of thn5e who woidd attempt to enforce the State law
Mr Jmevthe then p.es dent, answered this letter, and, very
properly, wftHsetf to «nda branch into the State, contrary to
the expressed will of the Legish%uxQ%
Thus the matter rested until 1£8Q, when this same gentleman
was a leading member of the Tennessee Legislatures and,
not having been able to get a Branch Bank of the United, Siato ,
he and others determined they would have a paper éa/íl-'
founded on State funds and the faith af the X&at* jfbey
passed an act creating a bank There w&s then m the Ste¿a
bank m which the fetate had twenty thousand dallara oftEe.
stock It was called the Bank of the State of Tennessee, anfl
had been so conducted as to give society <anlidetice ifi it j ask
m baptizing this new bank, its authors gave it exactly; the sa.m§
name, and thus we had, at the same time, two banks having
the same name, m the same State The friends of the oíd
would not have hesitated in charging the leaders^who estabh-afe-
ed the new with pilfering their name, that they might derive
benefit from their credit, had they been other than members of
the Assembly
The plan of this new bank was not to pay specie, and to
please the people, it was said it was a bank torelieve the people
from pecuniary distiess
At the same session, and to force mto circulation paper
money not redeemable m specie, laws were passed to pi event
levies of execution, unless plaintiffs would agree to receive
irredeemable bank paper
These proceedings met with very decided opposition from
the suppoiteis of a sound currency
They denounced a depreciated paper currency as a curse to
the country, and the old State bank would not touch the paper
of the new , and, after a long controversy between the directors,
undbi the admin stiation of an enlightened and worthy directory
of the new State bank, it was so conducted as to be ceuverted
into a specie paying bank, and I believe it has faithfully redeem-
ed whatever notes it put m cnculation
But, then, what became of the capital and profits 1 Much of
them were wasted There was a branch or agency m each conn
ty The cashier of the principal bank, a highly worthy, intelli-
gent, and generous man, could not resist the temptation: bft
permitted importunate and needy friends to draw checks, which
he paid when they had no funds in bank This practice was
detected and exposed, and he ruined
Some of the agents, men of as much integrity as those to be
found now, either used, or permitted others to use, the raenev^
intrusted to then care Those moneys were m some instances
lost, the agents ruined, and the State h&H been for several years
endeavoring to save something from the wreck
With these examples before me, I cannot, I will not, I dare
not, give my sanction to a scheme so demoralizing, and fraught
with so many mischiefs
But, sir, our history stops not here Itbmk, aboutihe year
1826, a Nashville bank failed, and occasioned much excitement.
The Legislature, then in session, repealed our act of H$t7,
imposing the tax of which I have spoken, a launch of* the
United States Bank was applied foi, and established It went
down with the principal and the other branches, and from that
time, until July, lS3b, we were State bank men, generally;
these banks having a safe specie basis, and always paying
specie Duimgthe whole of these arduous conflicts, others 
have had an advantage over me
They first wanted a United States Bank, that we might
have good cuirency every where Next they wanted paper;
money, and creditois foiced to receive it, or to get nothing,
then United States Bank notes again and now, when the mon-
ster is slain, and we can all ventuie to measure the lePith and
breadth of its supposed deformities, nothing will do them but
the pure, unadulterated haidmoney
Mr President, these politicians e\er have the advantage of
me I never can gi\e up an old opinion, until 1 am sore I
have found better reasons foi a new one They have the full
benefit of what is called the march of mind They march and
counteimarch so that I cannot keep pace with them I turn
slowly, awiwardly, and these politicians give me the dodge^
andaré sometimes out of sight before I know they intend to
change But this is of no consequence to me Such wills* with
the wisp oi jack4* with-the lantern I would not follow, if I
could see them They would only pilot foe into some quagmire
or swamp, and then leave me, although their dexterity could
easilv extricate themselves
For myself, I now am, and ever have been, a hard money
man, to every reasonable and constitutional extent Nothing
is, with me, money, within the meaning of the constitution)
but the precious metals, and they either corned, and theirvaiue
fixed by acts of Congres , or foreign com, whose value is de-
clared m the same way I\o Government, either State or
Federal, can make any thing else a tender in payment of debts
This kind of money, and this only, is the end of the law, where
pecuniary compensaron is to be made It is not only thestan
dard by which the value of other pioperty is to be fixed, but it
is itself propei tyy which can be applied to other useful pur-
poses The Federal Government has no power to incorporate
individuals, and bestow upon them hanking powers and prisi
leges to be exercised within the States
The Fedeial Government cannot issue, or authorize to be
issued, paper to be u«ed as a currency
The Constitution takes from the States the power to issue
bills of credit
It does not confer upon Congress any such power, and it can
exercise no power except that which is expressly given, oris
necessary and propei to give effect to some power expressly
granted The framers of the Constitution having taken from
the Spates the power to issue bill  of credit, and having refused
or omitted to confer =uch a power on Congress, believed ilfey
had secured the countiy against the issue ofapaper euireoejE,
by either Government, which individuals could have no means
by suit to compel the payment of, and which, if tolerated,
would be sure to depreciate
Befoie the Constitution of the United States was framed, the
States had the power to incorporate individuals, and give them,
banking powers and privileges this power was never taken
from them, and, therefore, they still possess it
I have believed, and now do, that in a country so extensive
as ours, so hishly commercial, and so free our business can
not be transacted without paper of some kind, which is not
money^ but cred>t the representative of r«ooev Thom creeits
will be highly injurious, unless regulated by law I wei^fere
have maintained State banks, at the same time wi&i£g to put
down, by all means m our power, «mall notes, to hftve1heiie
le*a than five, ten, twenty, and even higher than that,, if a
majority wibhed, so as to furnish a broad specie buaMhe better
to maintain and auppert the- organized credit , evweneea by
bank notes oi checks
It ib all idle to tell me that the only mode to haK&baM'i®OHey
is to put down State banks   Pot them down to-flaOrrow, am!
