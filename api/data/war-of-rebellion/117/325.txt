was not a prospect of an immediate exchange of prisoners. The presence of scurvy among men where there is an abundance of vegetables and antiscorbutic is a novel state of things to me, and I fear grows out of a want of attention somewhere, but as I cannot speak advisably on the subject I will only say that I wish you to give your personal attention to the matter.

Doctor McVickar speaks of the unwholesome condition of the police of the camp and you approved his report. There is no excuse for this as I have given positive and specific orders in relation to this matter. All the necessary means have been provided and if the camp is not in a good state of police it must be owing to great neglect. I will not go into details again but simply say that the camp must be put in a thorough state of police every day by the work of the prisoners themselves. Of course the quarters must be well aired and policed by removing all bedding and clothing from them once a week and there must be a free use of lime everywhere to neutralize all impurities. There can be no excuse for non-compliance with this order.

Under the order of General Halleck you will release J. D. Drake and W. F. Hail, prisoners of war, on their taking the oath of allegiance. On the recommendation of Surgeon McVickar you will parole Thomas Coulter, Company D, Forty-ninth Tennessee, for thirty days to the city of Chicago, he fixing a place at which he may be found at any time he may be wanted.

Hereafter, including last month's, the accounts of private physicians approved by you will be referred to the Surgeon-General at Washington for payment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
