ening attitude against Lee is to be maintained, or, in the event of the rumor of Lee having made any considerable detachment being confirmed, it is expected offensive operations shall be resumed - in either event - the reduction would be in opposition to my judgment.

If, however, it is intended to reduce this army to a defensive position merely, it would be as well to withdraw it to the nearest line in front of the defenses of Washington, in which case, should the Secretary of War think proper to ignorance any probable advance of the enemy, it might be materially reduced. As to the particular corps to be withdrawn, I have no opinion to give; it should be a question of numbers, and can be solved by an inspection of the tri-monthly return made for the 30th of September. I mean by having no opinion that I have no choice either as to retaining or sending away any particular corps.

Are there any officers or intelligent enlisted men in the cavalry who were with General Banks last year, and who know the roads to Stanardsville and Gordonsville, from Madison Court-House?

Unless you have started, do not come up until to-morrow, as the main army remains as before. The scout's report of yesterday was erroneous.
