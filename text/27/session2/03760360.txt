pnation. bill, but hia own conscience, and to make a law to suit
the occasion
Mr FILLMORE said the gentleman would dohimthejustice
to say that he (Mr Mr F )appealed^!rst to the Chair to know
m what mode they could lay aside the bill to take up the loan
bill The Chair seemed to be in doubt, and he (Mi F ) then
said, in hopea there might be two thirds in favor of it, he would
move to suspend the rules, without intimating whether they had
the power by the rules to lay aside the ore bill and take-up the
other or not Some gentlemen thought they had the power,
and some thoughtotherwise.
Mr WISE Whatdid the gentleman himself say? He spoke
not by word, but by action
Mr FILLMORE had just now stated what he had said, viz
that he took this as one mode of reaching a very important i ule,
and he did not know whether the other mode would be proper,
and it having failed, he made the motion to take up the bill m
committee, and the majority sustained him
Mr WI&E The mdjoritysustamed the gentleman against
the law of order. By appeal from the decision of the Chairman,
they had set up the will of the majority in the place of two-
thirds, and asked him t© vote for it against the dictates of his
conscience, he would say, if it was not out of order to talk about
conscience There weie three things which excited a ^neer
■whenever mentioned in this* House The first was conscience,
because the President vetoed a bill from conscience, the second
the Constitution, and the third per se, because the President had
used these words If it were not that these words had become
ridiculous, he would make some comment on th s course of
gentlemen They did not pretend to decide any thing in this
House by rules oi order, but gentlemen considered what mea
sures would be convenient for them, and if the decision of the
Chairman mterfeied with their views, they set it aside to suit
personal or party feelings, as on the appeal yesterday on his
amendment, when 9Í to 71 decided that in any torm they cho^e,
in a loan bill, they could not provide the ways and means for
the security of the loan
This was the complaint of the gentleman, and no more That
he (Mr W) voted with the gentleman to suspend the rules, yet
■when they came into committee, and the gentleman violated his
own construction of law, he (Mr W )could not violate hit  own.
Conscience. He mustcon/ess that conscience was a little trou-
blesome to him yet The very same remarks he had made on
going into Committee of the Whole, to take up the bill, he had
made on the amendment of the gentleman from Vermont, f Mr
Everett, J one of the oldest members ef this House—one of the
best, and one of the fairest, whom he had never known to violate
the rules Go, ye young Darntls, (said Mr W ) who have lately
abrogated to yourselves the power of legislation, and learn of
him what is order, when you decide that the Committeeof Ways
and Means can bring in an amendment, and the Committee of
the Whole cannot amend this amendment
He might go further back into the history of this delay than
the gentleman from Nev  York did At the beginning of this
session, instead of taking up the gentleman's own bills, they had
done what the gentleman [Mr Maxwell oi New York] charg
so on this House, is read by the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mi
Marshall ] Instead oí taking up the civil bill, the subjett of
the pubiie defences, orsome other of the impoitant bilis, they
had continued for more than fourteLn days on the subject of
cutting off a few pages and messengers, all the saving of which
wonld not amount to one-half or one tenth of the cost of thedis
cussion W ho was to blame for that) Were the inends of the
Piesidenfi
He called on the country to witness, and he begged the gen
tleman to hear his remark, that he never really thought the
gentleman was an incompetent or inefficient chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means Far horn it He wanted to
«ay that the chauman of the Committeeof Ways andMeans
had played the siorli this session, an I to prove it he would con
trast the course of the gentleman this session with tus coime
at the extr i session 1 his was the hut session of the Admmis
tration of John Tyier, hut the extra Fes3ion wa3 the session of
the Administration, do bonis non, of Harrison What hid
they then seen? They were early in Committee of the Whole,
and late to sit The one hour rule wis in force, every thing
was to be done under supreme order, by a trained band iegu
larly drilled to obey the movements of the chauman of the
Committee of Ways and Means I( the gentleman hid not
shown, at the called session, whathecoulddo,astnngei to him
would suppose, from his movements this session, that he was
a heavy, inert, Conestoga of a chairman 1 et him not tell the
country that he cannot move quickly if he will If he chose to
Bay that they would sit this bi'l out to night, the majority would
do it If he wanted them to vole, they would vote He had
proved that he could do these things The country would not
believe him when he said he could not got his bills along
He (Mr W ) would te'l the country what was the meaning
of this It had been determined, he was convinced, by one of
eager counsel than the chairman ofihe Commi tee of Ways and
Means, that nothing should be done At thismoment, whilst
thecoanty was sending up to this House one weeping wad,
imploring them foi the people's sake, for the country's sdke,
for Gol'-* sake to do something forthecountiy their business
wa« driesr^d, delayed, and clogged, and they were prevented

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Saturday, March 26, 1842
Mr THOMPSON of Kentucky moved that the House take
up the bill to extend the time for selling the land granfd to the
incorporated Kentucky Asylum for teaching the deaf and
dumb, and concur m a Senate amendment to the same The
motion was agreed to, and the amendment was concurred in
Mr FILLMORE then said he undeistood there were some
Executive communications on the table, one of which related
to the bill under consideration, (the loan bill ) He hoped, there
fore, such communication would be read
The Clerk accordingly read a communication from the Se
cretary of the Treasury, accompanied by extensive statements
of the issues of Treasury notes, correcting an error m the re-
port upon the state of the Treasury, made to the Piesident on
thp 7th instant and which was communicated to the House
with his late message respecting the issue and redemption of
Tieasury notes The Secretary states m this communication
that the error w?s one of a clerk, who took for granted
that all the Treasury notes issued in the months of March,
April, and Mav, 1841, and which bear a less interest than six
per cent had been long since redeemed, and did not think it ne
ressary to notice them at all, but limiting his inquiries to the
issues of six per cent notes, obtained from the shief clerk m the
office of the Treasurer, a statement dated on the 7th msíant,
showing the amount of sueh issues in the months referre 1 to
It appeared, however, upon a more careful research, that the
siatemeut from the Treasurers office was itself incorrect in
omitting an issue of $448527 46 of-axpercent notes, which aj
though actually mide in June, was, m pursuant eofaTreasiry
legulation, entered upon the books of the Treasury a^ of *he
month of May preceding Ihe discovery of this ei or induced
amore caieful examination in the officeofthe First Comptrol
ler, the First Audnoi, the Register of the Treasury, arc! Com
missioner of the General Land Office, with a view toa^cenam,
as far as the recoi ds of those offices would enable it to be done,
the amount of notes actually redeemed The statement from
the ifflces show that of the sum of $4,069,(5^5 80 issued as per
the Treasurers report in March, Apnl, and May, 1841, tho
amount redeem d is SI 056 7% ^, leaving a balance outstand-
ing of $3011,309 42, which exceeds the estimate of notes out-
standing, as mentioned in the Secietary's report, by the sum of
$1*548,309 42 From this sum the Secretary says a deduction
must be made for the notes remaining m the custom houses and
landofhees, which have not been íetuined to the Tieasury, the
anount of which, however, is not supposed to be large
This communication wasrefeued to the Committee of the
Whole on the state o[ the Union, having m charge ihe loan bill,
and was ordei ed to be printed.

When the comrri tee rest- ypsterhy, he was mqiunng the
object a°d the motne of the chairman of the Committee of
Wa\ sand Means, and tnepaity with which he ae ed, m doing
nothing at this session He asked the question last mg! t and
he repeated it again to day Why ws there a contrast between
threonine of the eentlenia [Mi Tillmoiíe] at the called =cs
sionand at this, m the expedition and despatch of business1?
Why was it that they saw that gentleman at this session holding
with the hounds and running with the hare"? Why was it m an-
other form that they heard the gentleman mingling the ciy of
"haste, haste" with the words "honor," and 'credit," and "in
teiests of the Government-!" And yet around the neck of every
bill which he presented to this House he t ed a millstone Why
was this course pur&uedí What object could there be in this
policy of do nothing at this lone, tedious session1* This was an
important topic, and an important subject What was the mo
Uve for this delay1? 'He who runs mav read" the whole po-
licy, and the whole design of the party m this delay But 1 e
abked if it was determined that Tohn Tyler, at all events, shall
b 'headed" m his attempt to do something foi a buffer
mg country? They had the problem of finance to sclve,
they had the question of the currency to settle, and the
difficulties of the Government to overcome, they had
pieparations to make for the public dpfence they had a
measurable amount of relief to vote to the country, and
the man who, by his wisdom and fhmness at this tune, shall
bring orderout of chaos, and prosperity out of depression, will
deseive a monurrent of gratitude hom this country The
trueoldrule as laid down by Horace, literally translated, was,
the intercession of the gods is ne% ei to be invoked, but to over
come d faculties worthy oí being solved by the gods 1 he dif-
ficulties and distresses and the en bmassments of the country
at this ume, he had almost s ud, and lie 1 oped he would not ím
piously have said it are worthy of solution by a Dei y It had
been his opinion for a lorg time that the wisdom oí man was
not to relieve the countiy, but. Hat time and Divine Frovi
deuce alone could sa\ c our mteic&tbfiom utter ruin Certainly
if those difficulty and emburas^mentt, werp not worthy of the
gods, they were w >rthy of the highest and noblest of men, be he
who he may lie genilen en opposite, u stead of pursuing
Hotace's goldtnrulc and reserving those difficulties ¡or Deity
tosolve, wereie&t rvingthem for sume pool feeble man Yes,
one who has now anothei sobi iquet—( a paiucul u chieftain"-—
as given to him in the couibe of the debate yesterday So they
were to have all the distresses, all the embaira snients of the
countiy postponed u til they had had ano her irial before the
pcof le, to see whethei 'the particular chieftain' could not have
theoppoitunity of obtaining he credit of a triumph and vu
tory over the&edis resse" Was this the policy of the gen tie-
men1* If they admitted it, and then conduct would seem to in
dicate it, he had another question to ask, and if not of them, he
ask^d of his cons ituen s and of the peop e at larg ,
of all parties—and it was a solemn and pertinent
question—what was to become of our poor countiy, wlnM po
hticians weie playing this game1? Debt, derangement, "con
fusion worst conloun led" was toreign, and bankrup cy, both
national and individual, was to destroy and wreck all around—
the currency was to remain in disorder, and the creditor as
well as the debtor was to be ruined, that they might wait foi
the oppoitunity for a "paiticular chieftain" to untie the knot.
Weie gentlemen so lostto alísense of patriotism as to attempt
to deprive the pre ent incumbent of the Presidential chair of
the honor and ciedit of seivng the country—it was theonly
honoi and c edit he a ked or that his friends asked for him,
when they must reco lect, then countiy and their constituents
were to b^ the sufflreis by this f Oiicy1? Was it true that these
gentlemen wt-re not w lling that either Gou or man should sa\ e
the countiy from its piesrnt embaita* men s, unless- batman
be their maní Was that the solution of this piocrastmation?
Politicians of Washington were no e too g od for this «uicidal
uoiicy it was i omg violence to no poliuuan «nature to pre
sume this calculation had enteied into the mo ivesof men and
