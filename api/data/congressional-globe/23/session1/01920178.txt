THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 1?,
War to say whether Owens had not been put to |
death by his oiders     This language, to say the
least of it, was not very tespectful to that perbon- |
age    Under all the cncums,.ances, viewing the
transaction as one that had been adjusted, and as
no ultimate pract cal benefit was suggested to arise
from the proposed inquiry, he would abstain fiom |
further discussing it, and for the present move
that the resolutioi be laid on the table.                     |
Mr LEWIS hoped the gentleman fiom Ala
h&ycA would withdraw his moaon to enable him .
to submit a few remarks                                             |
Mi   CLAY having withdrawn the motion, in
compliance with this request—                                  ||
Mr LEWIS said, he witnessed with much sur
prise the present opposition to the proposed in- l¡
quiry    He would not discuss tne merits involved
in the present question, but as it was the usual
course to adopt such tesoluticrs, when piesented
to the House, he could not see  ¡ ny reason why
that course should be departed fiom, although, as
was alleged,the matter was satisfactory a ljusted
Theie was much impottanre Utached by the gen
tleman to the law that wis passed, having given
satisfaction to the Executive, but he could not
acquiesce  in that impoitance, 01 as having any
weight on the present question     The íesolunon
submitted, applied solely to  the facts connected
with Owen's death     These fc-cts it wasotily light |
the country should be in full possession of     The
resolution called   foi   infoimrttion   whelher there
had been any impiopei interference with the juris
diction   claimed  by  art'   as he contended, right
fully belonging to, the S L.te couits of Alabama,
and it v/as pioper that these f cis should be sub-
stantiated     The gentleman [Mi   Claj-] coulü not   |
perceive any object as likely to glow (Utof the
lesolution, but he thougnt iheie might be vauous
objects anticipated fiom its adoption    Restitution

spoiled might I e oneol jeu      1 o restoie the juus    i

otheis might be named      lie owed it to  las con
stitutnts vnd to himse't to state, that the invebti
gation sought for was necessaiy and   proper, and
that the ¿ent'eman fiom Geoigm had his thanks
for having pioposed it
Mi BEARDSLLY having obtained the floor,
he gave way to
Mi GILMER, who disclaimed the intention of
using any language tnat could be deemed di'ie
spectful to the Secietaiy of Win he had not the
slightest intention of casting ai y tefleetions upon
him He had meant to eoi vey, that the depuly
maishal "as acting undei the general older of the
Secretary, and he «as willing to attend lo any
suggestion which the honoiable member fiom Ala
hama might conceive to be neoe s íy to fiee the
Secietaiy fion wl at he appiehende I was an lm
propei imputation He h id not ch< iged htm with
the crime of killing Owens, hu' that ti e oiders
issued were of a chaiaciei to justny iheact He

I      Mi   HILL sa d be had not had the privilege of
j a s ght of il e onbinal memouiil fioin Portsmouth,
but a menibei of tne House who had a copy of it
had kindly snown hat to him Of the two hun-j
dred and fiiiy petitioneis, «o far as can be ascer-
' tamed by gemlemei personally acquainted, there
is not a solitaiy fue ú of the 4.dniiiiistiation upon
1 it
In relation to this memorial he would ask leave |
to read extn cts fiom a lettei he uud recently re-
ceived fiom that town
"On  Sum day I perceived  by a notice  stuck
' up at the erd of i je buck market, that the Fedei
' ahsts of this  town were auout to merroriahze ,
' Congress U[ on the subject of the nubhc deposites   '
'Although this invitation wasgivtn to all, ' milt
I ' oiíí dis met on (f patty,' y-t I ieel persuaded that
' you will not fi id the nan e of a single fi ¡end of

' bauas«ed foi tl r wit t of money, save those who

I'a h gh puce     Tie agiicultunete feel no pres    I
' suje     They are reaping richly of the blessings ¡I
'of a wise and judicious Admimstiation, and of
I 'the bounties of a kind Prowdeice The mer
' cnants here might do the same, if it were not foi
' the con upt and corrupting, and shameful man-
* ogement of the banks—I say banks, because the
' most of the local Lanks in this town sympathize
'strongly in politics with Mr Biddle's bank and
' its branches
111 wdl venture to assort, and pledge my \era-
' city upon the assertion, that the branch bank in
'this place I as in her vaults at least ffty thou
'sand dollars in specie, and at least thnty thod-
'said dollars in local bills If the fact be so, it
' would enable that bank alone to discount over a
' hundied thousand dollars How much has been
1 ' discounted at that bank I have not the means of
'knowing
"Thio bank also refuses to send home the bills
'of the Commercial Bank, although the cashier
'has been renea^diy íequested to do so, and
' íeceive the specie for them "
Mr H continued Sir the number of petit on-
ers a'tacbed to the Portsmouth memorial is less
than one half the number of votes that have some-
times been cast by the opposition party in that
town
For some time past, it will be seen that the dis-
count of the Poitsmouth blanch has averaged
about $400 000 On the first of Januai y it was
¿305 033—it was reduced in hat month, when tl
was necessary topiepaiejoi (¡petition, to &362 378—-
making a coi traction of more than a thousand dol-
lars n a day
The Portsmoufh petit oners probably owe (he
lank ^t least thiee fourths of the whole debt
There aie but few debts due out oi that town, and
of the bank's debtois the names of some of these
few are on the petition
Sir, very few peisons at Portsmouth, or else-
whe e, in New Hampshire, would th ns of moving
in "a\or of the bank, except those who act in
this matter from party motives, for the bank has
been a blighting cuise to the men of business of
that place
There are, sir, on this petition several names of
persons who failed ¡h business four and five yeais
ago, and whose names are on bad paper at the
branch bank, five, ten, twenty, and up to sixty
thousand dollars each
i here aie also other names on the paper of re-
spectable gentlemen, men of reputed wealth, who
aie reported to have permanent accommodations
at the bank of f'om fiv e thousand to twenty thou-
sand dollar , which is emp'oyed m navigation or
manufactuung establishments
The brarch at Portsmouth, Mr President, ever
since lc26, has been raaniged for tne puroose of
political favoritism, since that time very few,
except political fuend3, have had loans on per-
sonal secuuty, and of the whole loss incuried,
it is beheved not a dollar has been ¡ostdi.ectly
by any defalcation of any friend of the Admims-
tiation
We have a right to nrerame, as well from the
character of the petitioners and their small rum-
be-, es from the efforts tnat the friends of tl e
bank have there made, that less than one fourth
of the people of Portsmouth is in favor of the
bank Independent of political bias, which a
few men enteitam, the friends! ip to the bank
is forced, from the fears of those who are de-
pendent on it These men are generally ttaders
whose capital is or has been furnished by the
bank
There is on the petition scarcely the name of a
mecnamc oi aitisan who labo-s with his own
hands The workingmen, mechanics, and man-
ners, and farmers of that town, are made of too
s era stuff to becompe'led to petition for cm object
like this and the pai y favored by the barjs has
too often been defeated in its attempts to coerce
those resolute, high minded men, at this time to
embaik on such an undertaking These men
have long follov/ed in the tram \ i h such men as
Langjon, and Manning-, and Hall, and Gardner,
and it is too late in the da> tor the Havens, and
the Ladds, and the Pierces, to lead them up to
any ercounter against popular rights
Ihe public voice in the State of New Hamp-
shire sustains the President's opposition to re-
charteung of the bank bv neaily three to one
No meetings in that State have been called to
