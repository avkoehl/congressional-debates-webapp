The fatigue duties have been heavy in this command in the beginning of the present month, and at all times the picket duty under fire is such as to induce the men to make the most of what provisions they have in their haversacks to satisfy their natural appetite. Tor these reasons I would respectfully and ungently recommend: First, that no reduction be made from the future rations to make up for the deficiencies in the rations already issued, as these deficiencies are, in my opinion, sufficiently justified. Second, that during the winter the allowance of hard bread, reduced from twelve ounces, be increased to sixteen ounces, as previously. third, that no more that two day's rations be issued at the same time to the men while in camp, and whenever it is deemed necessary to have four day's on hand these be kept ready to be issued when the order to move is received, which will occasion very little delay and will secure the full amount required to be carried by the men in active operations.

Respectfully submitted.
