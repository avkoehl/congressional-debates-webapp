FIRST DIVISION NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,

Headquarters, New York, May 18, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The Governor of the State of New York has assigned to my division nine regiments, several of which will be in readiness to move as soon as they can be armed, and it is undestood that a supply of arms will be received from Springfield early next week. The Governor, who is here, informs me that he has received your directions to send nine regiments to Fort Monroe and five to the city of Washington. It is proposed, unless you otherwise direct, that the regiment composing my division be sent to Fort Monroe, with the exception of the Eleventh (Firemen Zouves) now on duty at the capital.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to the General-in-Chief.

MAY 20, 1861.

I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion Major-General Dix would make a most excellent commander of the new military department of which Fort Monroe is to be the headquarters, and at which place his entire division (nine regiments) will soon be assembled.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War:

WINFIELD SCOTT.
