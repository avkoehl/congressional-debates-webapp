officer gallantly inducing him to fight his batteries too long before he retired it. There are a number of Yankee dead, all negroes but one, on our front, becoming very offensive to our men. Shall I send a flag and ask them to come, for humanity's sake, and bury them?

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 5, 1864-12.20 a. m.

The enemy tried to drive in our pickets this evening with a heavy force, but were repulsed at the causeways. Our lines are necessarily extended to meet the demonstrations on the Stono, and I fear the enemy may drive our pickets back in the morning, as I cannot re-enforce them without weakening the infantry supports of our works too much to meet an attack from the enemy landing from barges on the Stono above Grimball's, which the number of vessels in the Stono renders possible. The enemy are now firing on our lines and pickets with mortar and other shells.

Major STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BATTERY Numbers 2., July 5, 1864-7.35 a. m.

The enemy this morning have formed again two lines of battle and are perhaps waiting for the fog to clear off fully to allow the gun-boats and monitors to shell our pickets before they advance. I do not understand the meaning of the forming double lines unless they mean to advance. The gun-boats enfilade our picket-line, unfortunately, and the monitors look well into its rear. Can you not come over this morning?

Brigadier-General.

Major-General JONES.

BATTERY Numbers 2., July 5, 1864-10.20 a. m.

Cannot well estimate the strength of the enemy. He is reported to have two lines of battle and a line of skirmishers half a mile long, as far as seen, with woods on his left. I hardly think they will attempt to assault our works in the day, but he may push back our picket-line and establish batteries, and may attack the lines at night when we can with difficulty tell where to expect him, as he may demonstrate on several points. I can better explain when you come over. All is now quiet; the gun-boat have not fired since day-light.

Brigadier-General.
