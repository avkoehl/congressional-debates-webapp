TWO MILES SOUTH OF HILLSBOROUGH,

April 15, 1865-6. 30 p. m.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: Your two dispatches of 6. 40 a. m. and 1. 45 p. m. are just received. There has been no advance of the enemy on this front to-day. As the infantry have now a good start, it will not be necessary for you to engage the enemy seriously unless you can strike their cavalry. I hope that you will make a squadron retire on the direct road to Hillsborough, if you fall back beyond that point. You shall hear from me to-morrow.

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Commanding, &amp;c.:
