Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The Union men of Richmond sent us word last night, through our scouts, that the telegraph operator had left Stanton night before last-Sunday night. The dispatch also stated that the Yankees were expected to occupy Staunton early yesterday morning; General Early was retreating to Waynesborough; General Lee was in Richmond on Saturday in consultation with the War Department, and pontoon bridges were being put across the Appomattox. Fitz Lee had arrived in town wounded, his command remaining with Early. The three regiments formerly reported as having been sent to Lynchburg are all there troops that have been moved within the last week. Silver sold in Richmond yesterday at 29 for 1, and gold at 30 for 1. Mr. Davis had not returned from Hood's army up to yesterday morning at 10 o'clock The command rumors of the evacuation of Richmond are gaining strength. The wounded of Early's army are expected to arrive in richmond, but none of them have yet arrived. The brigades at Chaffin's, if taken up, have been replaced, as one of our agents saw South Carolinians on Sunday belonging to Bratton's brigade, of Field's division, who had just crossed the bridge. Files of Richmond papers are forwarded herewith.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Seven deserters (one sergeant, two corporals, and four privates) from the Sixth Virginia, Mahone's old brigade and division came into our lines this a. m. They bring no new information. Their regiment (Sixth Virginia) numbers less than 200 men for duty, and the brigade is less than 1,000 strong. In the estimate of strength of Lee's army forwarded a few days since, both heth's and Mahone's divisions are overestimated. There are not 5,000 men for duty at present in either division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
