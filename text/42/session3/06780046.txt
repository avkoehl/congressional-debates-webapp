VIOLATION OP THE OEGANIC ACT.
The gentleman charges that the Legislature
violated the organic act by increasing the sal-
ary of the treasurer of the Board of Public
Works, and that the board violated the law in
creating the office of treasurer. He says that—
*' The organic act provides specifioally that no sal-
ary of any officers should be increased, and that no
additional compensation should be given to any
member of the government beyond the amount of
his salary."
The answer to this is: that there is no such
provision in the organic act, and there is there-
fore no violation on the part of the Legisla-
ture. I may explain that the organic act pro-
vides that the Board of Public Works shall
draw money from the treasury of the District
upon their warrants.
Having thns legally obtained possession of
funds, the next step was to disburse them in
payment of their obligations. This could only
be done through some person selected for that
purpose. The board chose for this respons-
ible duty one of their own number, ana this
was done in accordance with a well estab-
lished principle of law that when a duty is
imposed upon an officer he is authorized to
employ such agencies as will enable him to
discharge it properly. Recognizing the in-
creased labor and responsibility thus imposed
upon the member of the board selected as
treasurer, the Legislature voted him a salary.
This, I contend, they had a right to do, and I
need hardly remind members that there are
few, if any, of our Territories in which the
Legislatures have not increased the salaries of
the territorial officers. This I know to be the
fact with respect to the judicial officers of many
of the Territories. If the people of the District
chose to pay the treasurer of the board a salary
in addition to that allowed by Congress, noone
here has the right to question their action,
much less to interfere.
In this connection the gentleman calls
attention to several contracts that are marked
"canceled" in the list; and here, as else-
where, he shows his utter ignorance of the
whole subject by attempting to convey the im-
pression that one contract is marked canceled
nine times. The explanation of this is simple,
and was within the reach of the gentleman if
he had desired to inform himself. Contracts,
as they appear in the list, are numbered from
one to five hundred and ninety-two. The
copy of. the report which he examined did not
contain the numbers, and hence the error into
which he has fallen. With these numbers
as they appear upon the corrected reports,
the whole matter is simple and easily under-
stood, and a large proportion of the criticisms
in which the gentleman has so freely indulged
is disposed of.
ruin op property-holders .
After presenting this purely imaginative in-
dictmentagainsttheboard, thegentleman adds:
" If this condition of things continues unchecked,
it will eventuate in the ruin of the small property-
holders in tho District of Columbia, and the transfor
of their possessions into tho hands of four or five
great holders, which great holders will all belong to
the Board of Public Works."
I have been frequently asked on thi3 floor
by members how our people were going to
be able to pay their taxes and carry on this
stupendous system of improvements, for they
cannot see how such extensive work can go on
without a large increase of the taxes.
The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that the taxes to-
day are no greater than they were before
these improvements were begun, and they are
ten cents on the dollar less than they were
under one of the administrations immedi-
ately preceding the present one. I declare
this result to be one of the greatest financial
achievements on record in municipal govern-
ment.
We now pay $1 70 on $100, over one third of
which is school tax. Compare this with some
other cities which I will name:
New York pays S2 27
Rochester pays o 70
Troy pays    4 30
Brooklyn pays 3 87
Albany pays   4 ot
Cincinnati pays 3 19
Philadelphia pays     2 05
on the one hundred dollars.
Besides it must be remembered that Con
gress has limited our tax to two dollars on the
hundred, so that it is impossible for the Dis-
trict legally to incur a debt, which will make
the tax higher than that amount. I venture
to say that our taxes are less than in any city
of the Union making any pretensions to thrift
or enterprise.
And furthermore, Mr. Speaker, it must be
remembered that the United States own ;two
fifths of all the taxable property in the city
aud pay no taxes upon their property, so that
the burden of the improvements, except as
appropriations may be made here by Congress,
falls really upon three fifths of the taxable
property of the city.
Gentlemen may answer that we have largely
increased our assessments or our valuation of
property. Let me tell them precisely what has
been done.
The taxable property of the District, real and
personal, for 1871, was $86,103,260. This
included $11,257,562 of personal property.
The Legislature of the District abolished
all tax upon personal property in 1872, and
ordered a revaluation of the real estate, which
resulted in showing a valuation of $85,960,863;
so that our real estate was increased in value
about the same amount of the reduction in
personal property; and no one familiar with
the facts will question that the present assess-
ment of real estate is below rather than above
its true value.
I desire to submit in this connection a let-
ter from the superintendent of assessments
and taxes of the District, together with a
synopsis showing the amount of improvements
made in the District during the past year:
Office Superintendent
of Assessments and Tasks,
Washington', D. C., January 15, 1873.
General : I inclose copy of a report this day made
to the (Jovernor. This return shows the increase of
new improvements made in the District unexampled
in our history.
Tho assessment on improvements for the fiscal
year endinsf June 30,1873, was $36,356,172. _ Thus you
will observe there is an increase in this class of
investments amounting to over nino per cent., show-
ins conclusively that the private citizens are vieing
with the Government in advancing the material
intorests of our District.
The assessment upon old improvements will be
somewhat docroascrt. as nearly all that class of
property loses something in value from age and use.
Tho assossmont upon the ground will not be en-
tirely completed for some months. Youwillobserve
that wo havoroached the point where we can com-
plete the assessment one year in advance of the
collection of taxes, thus avoiding many of the diffi-
culties attending thii work under the old govern-
ment. when the councils were forced to levy a tax,
though ignorant of tho amount of property assessed.
Very respoctfuily, your obedient servant.
