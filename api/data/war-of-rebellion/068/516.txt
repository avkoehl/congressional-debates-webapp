Lee's divisions, and drove them on the Spotsylvania road about 3 miles. They were very handsomely repulsed and drove on the road to Beech Grove Church. They had constructed barricades and rifle-pits, which we charged and captured. I had only four brigades engaged-Merritt's, Davies', Colonel Gregg's, and Colonel Devin's. They all behaved splendidly. I captured prisoners from Lomax's, Wickham's, Rosser's, Young's, Gordon's, and Chambliss' brigades, and killed Colonel Collins, of the Fifteenth Virginia Cavalry.
