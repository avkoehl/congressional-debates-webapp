HOUSTON, TEX., April 30, 1864-4 p. m.

Major General J. B. MAGRUDER,

Rusk, Tex.:

Griffin reports enemy in small force landed at Calcasieu. His scouts represent one gun-boat and one transport, expecting re-enforcements daily.

Reported plan to proceed up Calcasieu Pass to Lake Charles, thence against Niblett's Bluff, and flank Sabine Pass. They have burned bridge on Mud Bayou. Colonel Spaight has gone to Lake Charles.

J. E. SLAUGHTER,

Chief of Staff.

HOUSTON, TEX., April 30, 1864.

Colonel W. H. GRIFFIN,

Sabine Pass:

Direct Colonel Spaight to attack the small force at Calcasieu at once, and disperse, defeat, or capture the expedition.

By command of General P. O. Hebert, commanding district:

J. E. SLAUGHTER,

Chief of Staff.

HOUSTON, TEX., April 30, 1864.

Colonel J. S. FORD:

Major-General Magruder directs me to say that Major Russell has received information, copy* of which is inclosed and forwarded for your consideration. If the enemy are in such strong force at Brownsville and have the artillery as stated, with the force under your control it will be impracticable to storm it. It is very doubtful, the major-general believing that Banks must have withdrawn troops from Texas to concentrate in Louisiana on account of his reverses there.

It is forwarded for what it is worth; you being so near the spot, with better facilities of obtaining information, will of course be the best judge. The Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher mentioned by Major Russell has been invited to join you. As Major R.'s information of him is limited you will act guardedly in your dealings with him.

The expenses herein to be incurred as indicated by Major Russell will be arranged for and authorized at these headquarters if necessary.

C. M. MASON,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
