batteries to recruit, and furnished with money to pay the men their bounty.

The entire command is deficient in transportation. About one-half of what is on hand has been furnished by the State, for which the Confederate States have refused to refund the State or give or per diem.

I will make requisitions on the depot quartermaster at Goldsborough for the amount of transportation required, and hope will order it to be furnished. As the Tar River district has only been attacked to my command temporarily (as I understand it), I will say nothing of that section, or the troops there, in this letter.

I thus explain my position as far as I can at present, so that you may clearly understand it, and, in case of the enemy's advance, that you may have a sufficient force which to meet him.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. MARTIN,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Goldsborough, June 19, 1862.
