tion, freed from corruption, would be impractica-
ble, but, with its corruption, was the best that
ever existed To realize what was intended by
this great man, it must be understood that he
meantnot corruption in its usual sense of bribery
He was too able and patriotic to resort to such
means, or to the petty policy this bill is intended
to prevent Either of these modes of operation
was on too small a scale for him Like all gieat
and comprehensive minds, he acted on masses,
without much regard to individuals He meant
by corruption something far more powerful and
comprehensive, that policy which systematically
favored the great and poweiful classes of society,
with the view of binding them, through their in-
terest, to the support of the Government This
was the single object of his policy, and to which
he strictly and resolutely adhered throughout his
career, but which, whether suited or not to the
British system of Government, is, as time has
shown, uncongenial and dangerous to ouis
After the Constitution was adopted, he was
placed at the head of the Treasury Dtpattment,
a position which gave full scope to lus abilities,
and placed ample means at Ins disposal to rear
up the system he meditated Well and skillfully
did he use them His fiist measure was the adop
tion of the funding system, on the Bntish model,
and on this the two schools, which have evei
since, under one foim or another, divided the
countiy, and ever will divide it, so long as the
Government endures, came into conflict They
weie both in favor oi keeping the public faith,
butdifleied as to the mode of assuming the pub-
lic debt, and the amount that ought tobeasbiimed
The policy of Hamilton pievaih d The amount
assumed was about eighty million dolíais, a vast
sum for a countiy so impoverished, and with a
population so inconsiderable as we then had
The cieation of the system, and the assumption
of so laige a debt, gave a di ruled and poweiful
impulse to the Government, in the direction in
which it has since continued to move, almost con-
stantly
This was followed by a measuie adopted on his
own responsibility and in the fare, of law, but
which, though at the time it attinetod little at
tention or opposition, has pioved the most pow
erlul of all the nuaiiienipbji d in icaiing up and
maintaining his favorite systi m I n fi i to the
Tteasmy ordci diiccting the n cuptof bank notes
in the dues of the Governnu nt, anil which was
the fitst link in tint unconstitutional and unholy
alliance between this Government and the banks,
that has been followed by such disistious con-
sequences I have, Mi I'n sident, bien accused
of extravagance in assutmg that this unholy
connection with the paper system, was the gicat
and pnmai y cause of almost cveiy depaituie
from the pnnciples of the Constitution, and of
the dangers to which the Government has been
exposed I am happy to have it m my power to
show that I do not stand alone in this opinion
Our attention has lately been attiacted by one of
the journals of this city, to a pamphlet contain
mg the tame sentiment, published as far back as
1794, the author of which was one of the pro-
foundctand purest statesmen to whom our coun-
tiy has ever given bnth, but who his not been
distinguished in proportion to his eminent talent
and aident patnotism In confiimation of what
1 assert, I will thank the Senator from Noith
Carolina, near me, [Mr Strange,] to read a par-
agraph, taken from the pamphlet, which contains
oxpiessions as strong as any I have ever used in
refeience to the point in question
Mr  STRANGE read as follows

which mountains were heaped upon the giants by the dis
solute junto of Olympus "
Mr CALHOUN The next movement he
made was the boldest of the whole series The
union of the Government with the paper system
was not yet complete A central contiol was
wanting in ordei to give to it unity of action, and
a full development of its power and influence
This he sought in a national bank, with a capital
of $10,000,000, to be composed principally of the
stock held by the public creditors, thus binding
more stiongly to the Government that already
powerful class, by giving them, through us
agency incieased profit and a decided control
over the currency, exchanges, and the business
transactions of the country On the question of
chartering the bank, the great battle was fought
between the two schools The contest was long
and obstinate, but victory ultimately declared in
favoi of the national Federal school
The leader of that shool was not content with
those great achievements His bold and ardent
mmd was not of a temper to stop short of the end
at which he aimed His next movement was to
seiyc on the money powei, and he put forth able
icpoits, in which heasseited the bioad pnnciple
that Congiess was undei no other constitutional
lestriction in the use of the public money but the
genet nl welfmc, and that it might be appiopnated
to any purpose whatever, believed to be cnlcu-
leted to piomotc the geneial interest, and as
freely to the objects not enumerated as those that
wue specified in the Constitution To this he
added another and peihaps moie dangerous as-
sumption of power, that the taxing powei, which
was granted expiessly to raise revenue, might be
used asapiotectivepower for the encouragement
of manufactuics, or any other branch of indus-
try which Congress might choose to foster, and
thus it was in fact peiveited fiom a levenue to a
penal  power, through which  the entire capital
j and industry of the Union   might be controlled
Congiess was not piepared at that early stage to
tollow so bold a had, but the seed was sown by
| a skillful hand, to spiout when the propel season
aimed
When he letired fiom office no controlling
mmd was If ft to perfect the system which he had
' commt need w if h such consummate skill and suc-
I cess and shortly uftei, under the admimstiation
of the elder Adams, the alien and sedition acts,
and the quasi war with Prance, as it was called,
followed the violent and precipitate measuies of
less sagacious and powerful minds, and which in
their leaction cxpelltd then authors fiom power,
and raised Jeflerson to the Piesidency
He came in as a reformer, but, with the most
aident desire and the highest capacity to effect
a reformation, he could do little to change the
direction which his rival had impressed at tlu out-
set on the political machine economy, indeed,
was introduced, and the cxpendituies íeduced,
but the ligatuios which united the Government
with the paper system were too strong to be
buisted The funded debt, though gieatly re-
duced by him, could not be extinguished The
charter of the United States Bank had still half
its tuin to inn, and the uso of banks and bank
notes m the fiscal tiansactions of the Government
hid taken too strong a hold to be superseded at
once In the mean time, the agitation caused by
the gigantic conflict between Prance and England
rest lied our distant and peaceful shores, and the
Admimstiation was almost exclusively occupied
ineffoits to prevent aggressions on our rights,
and preserve our neutrality To effect that, every
expedient was attempted, negotiation, embargo,
non importation,and non-mteicourse,butm vim
War followed, and with it all hopes of cairying
out the reform contemplated by Jefferson when
he came into power filled
i     When peace aiuved, the country was deeply
I in debt Capital and industiyhad taken now
duection in consequence of the long ln'enuption
of out foieign commerce, ind   the  public atten
' tion was completely diverted from the questions
which had brought into co iflict the two great
political schools, and which had so long divided
the country
I    The season had now arrived when the seed
which had been so skillfully sowed by Hamilton,
as has been stated, began to germinate, and soon
shot forth with the most vigorous giow'h Du-
ties came to be imposed without íegaid to revenue,
and money appropriated without refi rence to
the granted powers Taiifffollovved tariff in lapid
succession, cauying in then tiatn a piofusion of
expenditures on harbors, roads, canals, pensions,
and a host of others, comprehending objects of
almost every descnption In such rapid succes-
sion did the protective duties follow, that, in 1828,
in the short space of twelve years arter the tei ru-
ination of the late war, they reached the enormous
amount of neaily one halt of the aggregate value
of the entne impoits, after deducting the reship-
ments Beyond this point, the system never ad-
vanced and foitunately for the countiy it did not
Had it continued lis progress a few yeais longer,
the enormous patronage which it placed at the
disposal of the Chief Magistrate would have term-
inated oui foim of Government by enabling him
to nominate lus successor, or by plunging the
li country into a revolution, to be followed by dis-
v union or despotism, as was foretold would be the
1   consequence in the report to the Legislatuie of
I Virginia, so often leferred to, if the system it
repiobated  were cained   out in  pinctice     But,
I happily, with the tariff of 1828, the leaction
commenced, and has been evei since piogressing
How or by whom it was commenced, and has
been urged foiward to the present point, this is
not the pioper occasion to state All I piopose
now, is to tiace its ptogress, and maik the point
at which it has arrived
The first step of this retrogiade movement was
the oveithtow of the administration of the young-
er Adams He came into power on the extreme
principles and doctnnes of the Federal national
school, and on them he placed the hope of main-
taining his elevation For the truth of this assei-
tion I appeal to his mauguial addiess and his
messages to the two Houses at the openings of
the annual sessions, and to expel his Admims
tration from power was, of couise, a piehminary
and indispensable step towards the íestoiaiion of
the pi meiples and doctrines of the opposite school,
and fortunately tins was effected by a decided
majonty at the expiration of his fust teirrt
lhe next step was the final dischaige of the
funded debt, and for this important step, at so
early a period, the countiy is indebted principally
to a friend, now, unfortunately, no more—the
amiable, the tolented, the patriotic Lowndes—
the author of that simple, but effective measure,
the «inking fund act, passed shortly after the
termination of the late war
But the most foi mutable of all the obstacles—
the souice of the vast and coriuptmg suiplus,
with its host of extravagant and unconstitutional
expenditures, the protective tanff, still lennined
in full foice, and obstiucted any fuithei piogiess
in tbe leaction tint had commenced     By what
| decided and bold meisuits it was oveicome is
well known to all, and need not be told on this
occasion It is sufficient to say that, aftei a long
and dtspcrate struggle, the conhoversy teitnin-
ated in the compromise act, which abandoned
tin pioteotive principle, and has, I tiust, closed
forever what has pioved in  this Government a
I most piolifie souice of power, pationage, and
coiruplion
I The next step in the progress, was the ovei-
throw of the Bank of the United States—the cen-
tei and soul of the paper system—a stc p that may
justly be regaided as not infenot to any othei m
the whole senes That was followed by the de
posit act of 1836, which transfeired to the tieis-
uues of the States the vast suiplus, which con-
tinued to flow in upon us, notwithstanding the
great reduction undei the compromise act This
decisive measure disburdened oui suichaiged
Tieasuiy,and hasfoiced on this Government the
necessity of retienchment and economy, and
theicby has grea'ly stiengthened ind acceleiated
the leaction   So necessity is the leduction of the
[ income to leform, that I am disposed to íegard it
as a political maxim in ftee States, that an im-
poverished  Treasury,  once in  a generation   at
I least, is almost indispensable to the preservation
I of their institutions and h jeity
j     The next stage m thcprogiess was the suspen-
I sion of the connection between the Government
