CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
The Senaíor from Maryland [Mr Merrick] is informed that
Er a hu,rchm IS not a connexion of the Postmaster General,
f J° Sey mt caI1 hlm c0"8>^   Í put the question to him
[m Mb&rwk beiieved the chiidien of the Postmaster Gen
eral called him^fcuam }
Very gjod ' thechildren must have got it from the old peo
pie But no matter The Postmaster General makes the case
lus own He has not moved heaven and earth to e*k,ct hie au
poiniment, fori do not thmk he could move either of those
places, but he has moved whaihecan to effect it, he has mu^ed
foot, tongue, pen, and types, to do it • and; if he ¡succeeds, will
have the credit of having effected a Yio'aUon ot the Fiesident's
rule against removals
Mr B said the Senator from Maryland [Mr Mj3reig&3 wished
to treat the resolution Which he had submitted as a joke, and
appealed to him to withdraw it frfr B rather considered his
Opposition ton as a joke, and appealed to hitó to cease it
End as it may, said Mr B , I have accompl shed my ob.ect
I nave traced the publication in the Madis«man to the Post
Office Department I have shown it to be false in relation to
myself, and a violation of the rales which claim secrecy for the
papers and archives of the office
Mr LINN said he thought they must now be ad pretty well
convinced that an entire removal of the injunction of secrecy
from the executive sessions of the Sena e would be of dec ded
advantage   It was clearly perceived to act injuriously in a great
number of caaes, and in many anomalous cabes, (such as the
present, in Which his honorable colleague was coneerned ) the
question occurred as to what ought to be considered secret, and
what ought not    Persons were permuted, he beueved, by the
heads of departments to examine, and even to copy or commit
to memory, the con ents of any paper or letter which was there
sled   He believed this was so, although other Senatois he had
no doubt, had better opportunities of knowing the fact, as he
seldom troubled himself with any examination personally at
any of the departments    As regaided the case of Mr Watson,
he (Mr Linn) never anticipated that anything luie a charge
against hib honorable colleague would have grown out of it
The only charge that could b- asserted, however, he was well
assured, could only be made for political purposes   The Sen
ator fiom Illinois had had the correspondence biought up, and
his (Mir L ^colleague andhi-nself had looked overapartof that
Correspondence, and he recollected that his colleague s a ed his
intention to publish one of the letter^,- a detei mination which he
(Kir L ) was very far fioin opposing, as he Relieved no harm
eonld possibly arise fi omits publication    All thecor'emptu
bus language m the Mad soman mtimatirg that the honorable
Senator had been guilty < f an improper act in authonz t z the
publicati >n of tint letter) was altogether frivolous and without
foundation, and he was a little suipused that his honorable
colleague had felt it necessary to take any notice of the matter
He (Mr Linn) diu not wish to derive any citdit to hi<nae)f
for justifying the conduct of his honorable colleague, it would
Hot be justly his due, for he could net considei it a very high
merit id applaud where he ceitamly had no reason to con
defrm    A similar letter from the same gentleman had for
rherly been published having b°en taken from the files in the
War Office for that purpose    The publication of that lettei
hé (Mr Linn) very much approved, ard he had q nte as utt'e
reason to disapprove of the publication of the present    He
knew nothing   about the  rules  which govern 'be depart
ments in this matter    but he thought that, at least,  upon
the occurrence of an anomalous case like this, it would be
proper to  take  up  the   inquiry     Bt t  it would   be  still
better, he was fully convinced, to remove the iniuncti n of
secrecy  &s  regards  the executive sessions  of the Senate
If this were done, the Executive officei of this Government
would be exceedingly careful a*- to the recommendations w hich
he offered    Persons who had made thüm *1 ves useful in aiding
an executive officer m acquiring powr tame here foi there
ward of their servicer    This was not at all extraoid *i***y, it
^Ould be so undei all administrations    Bal m."ri whip ever
ííioñt fo ^ard   > ibseu their claims, and by means of the white-
washing to which   h<> junction of seciecy afioids so great fa
cilitievhey very frequently succeed in attaining their object He
(Mr Linn) would be glad to see tr a* injunction tal en off, he
had no secreteas regarded himself and it was with reluctance
that he became the depositoiy of the secrets of aiy "ne, 01 of
any patty, he felt even inclined to look upon them wit! ch&
trust    Let the injunction of secrecy be taken olí and the course
of all parties would be «to clearly defined that each would know
precisely -what was correct and what was not     He (Mr Linn)
would not have considered it aeoefeoaiy to make any observa
tions Upon this subject were it not that he was unwilling that
U should go to his constituents that he condemned the conduct
Of his honorable colleague, when it was r ot the case    He had
(ioue no such thing     When a difference did occur  if it evei
should, it would then b   tim° enough to assert that difference
The subject would piobably come up m another place and he
{Mr Linn) would then give his oj in on upon it, a3 fully at. the
question demanded
Mi   PRESTON made «omt remarks touching the course of
the departments with itfereice to matteis on file     He hai
never been able, from «m h couise to come to a decision in his
own mm 1 as to what wd  cot fidential an I what wis noi     It
seems that, while they lefnse to let persons nive copies of let
ten on file they peimit the same pei* ono to read ovei the con
tents of those etters, and a  m sht be lone, C( mm*   them to
memoiy     Here en ei to a letter of his own   whiui w s in
tended to gi\p rerUm mfOittMtion, in confide  ce, to the Pout O
ficel>eputnent,wh ch   ins e id #>f ben" held ¿s a [ei«t-ul
document, (as k b ulM ave been ) wa° placed on the files cf
the office  and at la t   hron°h th" access ¿iven to the archives
of the department, w as made j ublic    He thought it should b
properly defined what was to be co isi lered c >nfi ienual   and
whatnot, that Se a nu«nd standing commit ees might gov em
themselves accoi lingly   i« Jtwa« they could not know     ^o
far as he was concerne 1   a   the head of one 01 the an'i <?
committees he hadalwa\   metered matters of an executive
character, which wetclailh fire that committee ?s c > t con
fidential nature   and hac  «nneined himself arc idinglv     Tit,
wished somem e would bt alopted, detinin" what eh ni i he
held as confidential    The ^ clu i n belore the senile eon I
not effect that object    lit, did nit think any good could result
from its adoption, and hoped the Senator woutd not press u
especiallyas he bad placed nijuxtaposiionwui the chaigeof
violation of confidence the ía t that if there was any guilt at
all. the source from which the charge emanated was equally
guilty, that the Senator had had access to, and had made ust
of, the same letteis upon vtl ich the charge wa.s founded
Mr MERRICK then obtained the floor,and made a lew mote
remarks? but before concluding, the morning hour had expired
The subject was then passed over informally
Mr   8LVIER presented the petition of William Strong, of
Arkansas praying indemnity for losses sustained in construct
ing embankments on the United States road leading from Mem
phis, Tennessea, to Lit leRock, Arkansas, which was referred
to the Committee on Claims
On motion of Mr SEVIER,
Resolved, Tnat the Committee on Indian Aflkirs be instruct
ed to inquire iito the expediency of paying fo F A Kerr his
tiavelhng expense*, and as agent for controlling and issuing
rauoiw to the Osage indiana m theyeais 1838 and 1839
Mr SEVIER from the Committee op Pensions, reported a
bill for the relief of Waieham Eingsly, which was read, and
oidered to a second reading
Mr LIISNgave notice that he would, on to morrow morainer,
during the morning hour, ask the Senate to take up for consid
eratnn the bid to indemnify Major General Andrew Jackson for
the one thousand dollar fine, ard the adverse report of the Ju
diciary Committee on the same
Mr YOUNG, on leave, introduced a bill for the relief of
Daniel B Bush, which was read twice, and referred to the
Committee on the Public Lands
The Senate tl en proceeded to the consideration of the special
order of the day, being the bill to provide further remedial jus
tice in the district courts of the United States
Mr CHOATE agreed with the Senator from Georgia [Mr
Berrien,] an 1 the Senator irom Pennsylvania, [Mr Buchas
AN,3¡nregaiding this as a very important bill It was un
doubtedlyof paramount importance to exercise the constitu
tional jurisdiction of the national tribunal to a sufficient extent
to effect one of the great objects of the Federal Government—
which is to take charge of, adjust, and control, the foreign rela
tions of the country. He had no doubt that he should be able to
satisfy the Seriate that the bill now under consideration was not
only constitutional but indispensable Befe re he advanced to
the clause m the Constitution under which he considered the
provisions oí the bill authorized, he begDed leave to say that
this p<nvens consequent upon the functions of G vernment,de
puted by the Conátuution itself m other respects and without
wl l^h the judicial power wouid be inelhcient in instances
where mobt needed m suppm of the hoimonious action of
Govern nent This view he illuatiated by the analogous and
undisputed powei of the pud cial department m relation to
civil cases between the Status ard -subjects of foreign poweis
One great object of es ab íahmg thejudicial department and
rriking it a co ordinate branch of the Government, was that, H
might promo*e and maintain peace between thisconfedeiation
and. thf* rest of the world In referring to the Federalist as an
authority for his argument on this head, he pronounced a glow
ing eu'ogium on the writers of that book IK ihen quoted
Luge y trom the book itst-lf The tendency of the quotations
was to show that the peace of the whole I'mon ought not to be
left m a condition to be jeoparded by a fragmentary part,
and hence the necessity of giving to the judicial department all
control c ver both criminal and civil cau cs between the States
and ftreumer  whose rights may depend on the law of nations
or their allegiance to their own Government" He referred 11
the debates in convention with regard to the lurisdiction of the
national tribunals in which it was laid down as a general pnn
ciple that &uch jurisdiction should ex end to alicates involving
the national ptiace and harmony He contended fiom this,
that, in can ymg out the pnncip e in det if thelSiational Legis
Jaturf was b in I to keep in view the general object as far as
the letter of t! e Constitution did not pio'nlut expiu.ely an Ho
embrace suth c^ses as that of McLcod, which might jeopard
*hc general peace                ,
He would now pioceed to thelque^tion, whether tlm power
was tobb foundm the enumerated powers of the Constitution
In the second section of the thn 1 artici*1 of the I orsutution,
amen" the enumeiaed poweis given tc the pdiciil lepait
nent is that extending us jui ¡^diction to controietsies be
twet"  wo oí moie tota es between a ¡Mite a d ci ¡zens ~>f
anothei State, between citizens of diffeieut tetates, between
citizens of the same Mate claiming lands under giants ol dif
ferent totates and Ketween a Stale, or the citizens iheieof,and
foreign Stat CS) ciliA^ns, or subjects" Mr C here dwelt for
acorbideraole time on the punt that "controversies^ in this
clause, applied equa'lv to cuminal cases as to civil cases He
refer  ed to I uther Martm and Givernor Raniotph, as well as
various other authonties, to show the synonymous use of the
terms ' casee,i and "contioversies ' The second paragraph of
the same section and article of the Constitution mat quoted,
says ' In all cases afTectingambae^adors other public ministers
and consul5: and those m which a S ate (shall be a party, the
Supreme Court shall have original lurisdict on } Here th

sec 8j ofthe Corstitution
On this provision of the Constitution he rested, as covering
the whole ground Theie could be no qu°>tio« theiefore, oa
the right of Congress to pass this law and the Senator frora
I ennsylvama knew well theie was none bin the whole question
really was, as to the jurisdiction Now he cornenned %U& bill
didnoÉ go one tenth of the length it might go in defining the?
cases io which this jurisdiction might be ext< ndéd under tíya
law of nations, over which Congress I'Od undoubted conuol
The only question, he conceived which could remain, was*
what court should have jurisdic ion m suth a case as that of
McLeod This, he argued, was beu'ed m the nect ssary cbargs
which the General Government had ovei the laws of the Lnited
States, m which the law of nations was incorporated, but ha
did not contend that the jurisdiction ofthe Federal G jvemmeot
was exclusive over every caee controlled by the law of nations,
such as cases of insurance but over eases afU ctmg th" national
peace and harmony of the Union, an 1 tí o^e necessarily in-
volved in the enumerated functions of Government
He referred to the arguments of tl e Ser atcr f om Pennsylva-
nia, IMr Buchanan 3 grounded on the decision of ihe court in
the ca^e of Martin, and quoted passages fiom the amverof the
comt to Mr Barbour's arguments aaamst the power oí the
Supreme Court to remove c-i<?es fiom State tnbunais' till after
judgment
[Thi« brought up explanations from Mr Blchanan, amd ar-
guments from Mr Choate, all of which being technical  afidt
involving nice legal distinctions we necessauly omit, lest #e
might misstate points with which we are not oonvei ant ]
He next argued the expediency of the manure He con
tended that, in every respect it was better the Federal Govern-
ment should have jurisdiction over such cases as that of
McLeod, than that any State should exeicise it He contended
it would be bcttei for the individual accused, for the preserva
tion of peace with foreign countiieg, for the mutual interests,
of nations , and for this countiy itself
For the numerous reasons he had adduced, hf* would give
this bill bis hearty concunence
Mr HUNTINGTON next obtained the floor, but offered to
yield it to any gentleman op, o^ed to the bill who might feet
disposed to reply to the •Senatoi iiom Mas^achu et s As, how-
evei, it was then half p st 3 o clock ai d too late to proceed
