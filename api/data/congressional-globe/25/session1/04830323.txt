Jackson, and that, I suppose, is capping the.climax of enor

moiais of the People' It cannot regulate currency and ex-
change, but it may pass bankrupt Jaws to put in durance vile
eveiy State coiporation of the Union' Such are President

feir this doctrine is so new that the President, throughout
this very Message, except m thowi parts where he is expressly
