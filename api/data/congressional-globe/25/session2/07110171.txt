of branches of the late Bank of the United States,
and it ga\e the banks, which it authorized to be se-
lected, an almost absolute control over the remain-
ing eight hundred, by the power which the posses-
sion of the public moneys would give them, and
by their authority to decide on the receivabihty of
their notes, in payment of the Government dues
And all of this bank agency and machinery to be
put in motion by the Secretary of the Treasury1 It
effectually organizes the whole moneyed power of
the country into one compact system, and places
this tremendous engine of political power in the
hands of the Executive branch of the Government1
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr Clay], though
he does not seem precisely pleased with the plan
proposed by the Senator from Virginia, as a place
of permanent residence, yet expresses his willing-
ness to "stop at it as a good hall-way house " How
long he proposes to abide there, he does not inform
us, but his generous hospitality will no doubt in-
duce him, in return for the civilities received
while- there, to invite the Senator from Virginia to
accompany him to the end of bis journey, and there
partake with him of a great national entertainment.
The Senator from Virginia, in making his poli-
tical survey of public sentiment, m the different
States of the Union, had invaded the limits of the
State which he in part had the honor to represent,
and conjectures, from the elections held there in
August last, for members of the House of Repre-
sentatives, that the majority of the State is against
the present Administration Mr B said, without
undertaking to decide what public -entiment w as,
m that State, m leference to the policy of (he Ad-
ministration, he could, at least, assure that gen-
tleman, that he had formed an opinion respect-
ing it, on grounds which were very fallible It
was true, that a majority of the members of the
other branch of Congress, elected fiom ihe State of
North Carolina, at the last election, were in oppo-
sition to the Administration, but it was equally true
(hat a majority of them, in 1834, were likewise
against the Administration, and that it had con-
tinued to be the case from that time to the present
period, with this difference, that the Opposition had
gained one more member in the last elections than
they before had It would, therefore, be seen thft
the Opposition w ere, in la34, represented by a ma-
jority of members from North Carolina, and that
at the elections of 1835, the same relative number
was again returned Never, said Mr B had the
great political questions of the day been more di-
rectly carried to the polls', m the State of North Ca-
rolina, than on the question of his own re-election,
and, on no occasion, had the friends of the Admi-
nistration succeeded by a more d^cisn e majority
elected to the Legislature, the great question of the
removal of the deposites then being before the peo-
ple According to fhe modem Whig logic on the
sirbject of instruction, which assumes eveiy rule to
instruct representatives but the right one, it would
have been his duty, because a majority of Opposi-
tion members men represented ísorth Carolina,
and were re elected at the next year's elections, to
have considered himself instructed then, and to
have resigned his seat, or have united with the Op-
position, although just re-elected by so large a ma-
jority His colleague, «ho so ably and honorably
fills a seat m this body, was likewise elected to it
when a majority of the members, in the other end
of the Capitol, from North Carolina, were opposed
to the Administration Mr B said, m no State in
the Union were the great body of the people more
inclined to re-elect their Representatives, even
sometimes of opposite politics, thaa were the
people of North Carolina In their elections, poli-
tics were not always made the only test, as he be-
lieved they were not in some of the recent elections
in that State
There had been no public meetings, as far as he
was informed, m North Carolina, on the important
questions now before the Senate, except in the sin-
gle county of Warren—a county long celebrated
for its sterling Republican sentiments, and whose
citizens had long been the friends and neighbors of
that illustrious friend of civil liberty, the late Na-
thaniel Macon A more spontaneous and unani-
mous expression of sentiment never was given, by
the people of any one county, in favor of a mea-
ture, than, he learned, had, on that occasion, been
declared, by their resolutions, in support of the pre-
sent great measure proposed by the Administra-
tion
In relation to the right of instruction, he would
say now, as he had on other occasions, that none
respected it more than himself, and none would
more readily yield obedience to it, or, if he
could not, consistently with his views of the
Constitution, carry out such instructions as the Le-
gislature of his State might choose, at any time, to
give him, he should consider himself bound to re-
turn his trust to those who bestowed it, that their
wishes might be represented by other , of like sen-
timents with their own He had never considered
himself, on any principle as to the right of instruc-
tion, bound to go in quest of public opinion, in
discharging his du'y here, on the great questions
that come before him. In the absence of mstrucUens
from his Legislature, ne made it a rale to pursue
the dictates of his own judgment, but when reso-
lutions should reach him, if any such should be, at
any time, pasved, they would either be obeyed, or
a resignation of his seat, in the Senate, would be
the only other alternative In relation to the great
right of instruction to Senators, no other rule had
ever been contended for by the Republican party,
than that which he had suggested
He congratulated Senators, in opposition, who
now expressed so much exultation, at the instruc-
tions latelj gn en to some of the friends of the Ad-
miaii ion, ontheirimproved doctrines, on thesubject
of that great Republican principle The read)
ob^icnce which had been paid them by the Se-
nators instructed, was not a mere profession, but
it formed an essential part of the political creed of
the party to which they belonged Hsw great was
ihe conliast, and how striking w as the degree of re-
spect paid to their constituents, in the conduct of
the friends of the Administration now, who are
mstiucted by their Legislatures, and that of Oppo-
sition members, some years since, under similar
circumstances' In the one case, it was obedience, re-
spectfully given, m the other, disobedience, some-
times accompanied with reflections on those who
gave them. This essential difference, on a great
question of popular liberty, cannot fail to attract
public attention, in deciding the question as to
which of the tn o great parties is hereafter to ad-
minister the Government
Mr B must again lepeat the opinion, that the
issue now made up, before the country, and which
it'was called on now to decide, was substantially
one, involving the important question, whether the
people or the banks were to rule, and whether the
nation w as to continue to govern itself, oi to trans-
fer its power, m effect, to irresDonsible mone\ ed
corporations If the Admimstratit n is put down
in this contest, he should consider it as tantamount
to a declaration to the world, that the i oice ot free-
dom is extinct in our Republic, and thu the na-
tional spirit has mgloriou«!y succumbed at the
sordid shrine of the moiiejed power The most
lenowned republics in ancient times, had must suc-
cessfully maintained their liberties, so long as they
had taken for their guide the principles of an eleia-
ted patriotism. So long as this spirit had prevailed
among them, they had maintained their indepen-
dence, but when they were ovei taken by the deba-
sing feel ngs of avarice, and had yie'ded to their in-
fluence, their declension was rapid, till they had
fallen <nto the arms of some tvrann^al mas-
ter, because they were unfit, longer, to go\ern
themselves The true way, not only to preserve
liberty, but to preserve property, is for a nation to
act on the high and honorable principles ot our
nature Yielding great principles to meie mo-
mentary events, from selfish molives, and a
fear of meeting consequences, is, ¿n mo^t
cases, in the end, but the sacrifice of per-
manent future good to a mere tempoiary benefit,
and is, when considered as a meie question of in-
terest, a great error When the Romass, in the
last days of their degeneracy, were invaded b)
barbarian adventuieis, and cideavoied to purchase
peace by pajmg them large sums olmone), thej
but united their return, with increased strengio, to
sack and overrun their countrj 1 or the American
people now to submit to the demand  of the banks
and then partisans, is to render their rights and in-
terests, hereafter, more insecure, by thus inviting
new demands on them. Now is the time—not by
any violation of their rights—to resist and weaken
that great power, by the measure now proposed
If, sir, said Mr B the banking interest prevails
m the contest, the unavoidable consequence will
be to bring th  high tariff and old Federal parties
into power Individuals of that party, who have
been under the ban of public opinion, for their
political misdeeds, for years past, will begin to
look for their restoration to power with as much
anxiety, as did the royal French emigrants for the
reitorauon of the Bourbons to the throne of France.
Even the survivors of the old Hartford Convention
may beco e inspired with new hopes, and Aboli-
tion will no doubt join in doing honor to the occa-
sion, with increased hopes of accomplishing its fatal
pui poses
He now considered it his duty to notice some re-
marks which had fallen from the Senator from
New York, [Mr Tallmadqe,] having allusion to
the future prospects of the present Administration,
m regard to public sentiment 11 remarking on
the results of the late elections, in the State of
New Y ork, that gentleman has, in emphatic lan-
guage, warned th« presen Chief Magistrate, unless
he changed his course, to beware of the Idas of No-
vember, 1840, [Mr. Tallmadge, having obtained
permission to explain, said that he had referred to
the next Fall elections.] Mr. B resumed, and said
that although he had misunderstood the Senator as
to dates, } et his remark did not, with the less force,
apply to the great issue, which was now making
up on the next Presidential election, and was to be
considered to be intended as a warning to the Pre-
ident of the United States, to beware of the fate
w hich, it s intimated, then awaits him. In reply,
he could onlj sav, th?t if the State of New York,
great in resources, great in intelligence, and equally
distinguished fcr her high and patriotic bearing, in
ever) difficult u sis, gave way and yielded in the
present grept corte^t, that her sons would be for-
getful of the principles, and of the revered Repub-
lican names, which had so highly adorned her an-
nals That it w ould mark the extinction of that
sacred spirit of liberty and of valor, which had won
for her the never-fading honors of Saratoga, where
the tide of war in the Revolution was first success-
fully turned against a proud and powerful invading
army
Mr B said that the period which marked the
greatest degeneracy of the Roman empire, before
Us final dissolution, was that in which the office of
Emperor was set up to sale by the prae'onan bands,
and the successful cand date borne to the imperial
throne on the shields of a mercenary soldiery If,
at this early day, and in the youth of our Republic,
the present Chief Magistrate is to be driven from
power, for the high and honorable stand that he has
tal-en, in behalf ot the rights of the people and the
Const tuuon, it will mark a degeneracy in our
eoumr,, equally rapid and ocnous of the fate of
its iVe institutions Borne to the Presidential
office by the pnetonan bands of ihe banks, his suc-
cessor would be but (he honored tool of the mo-
ne) ed power, which had triumphed over the Con-
stitution
It had, s?1d Mi B been the fate of the ancient
Republics ol Greece, to lose their liberties at the
fatal battle of Cheronea The Republic of Rome
had lost its liberties at the equally disastrous battle of
Pharsah?, but the heroic deeds of the brave men who
fell in the struggles foi them, in both countries yet
lived in fame, and the pen of the historian
hai immortalized them But what would be
the sentence of the future histonan of this
country, «ho snou'd iecord that ou-' young
Republic had been mgloiiously conquered by
the moneyed powei, ard hai thus \íelded up all
tne laurels which its fortitude, wisdom, and valor,
on all gieat oceasions, have won for it1 He did
not, however, indulge in gloomv anticipations, as
to the íesult of the decision of the people, on the
gieat questions now at issu  On the contrary, he
saw nothing, fither in the times, or m the eircum-
vtani.es oi die times, to discourage the friends of
tree Government, but every thing, m looking to th 
past history ot our country, and its capacity to
rise superior to difficulty, to presage 'victory, and
cheer its friends with the bright promise of ultimate
triumph and c«rtam success.
