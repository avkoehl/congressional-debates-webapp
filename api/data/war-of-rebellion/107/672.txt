besieged as I am by hundreds of sick soldiers, by persons seeking protection for their property, and answering innumerable questions from every bewildered soldier, besided doing all the writing and copying myself. I have just received a long communication from General Shields which I will send as soon as I can by telegraph.* General Duryea's brigade is beginning to get on the train for Catlett's. You direct Ricketts to move his artillery and cavalry to Catlett's on the arrival of Banks' artillery and cavalry at Front Royal. When is the infantry to move?
