I don't know who Colonel Crooks, Twenty-second New York Cavalry, is, except that he reports himself senior officer of cavalry, and that he was about 2 miles this side of the Rapidan when he sent word in about the columns of dust. He has just sent another (verbal) report that his skirmishers were engaging the enemy's 1 mile this side of the Rapidan.

Colonel McIntosh, who has just here, reports he has been moving from Ely's to Germanna Ford. I now send a squadron to Germanna from here. Your dispatch received and contents communicated to Colonel Crooks.
