STEVENSON, October 6, 1863-8.30 p.m.

Major-General. BUTTERFIELD:

In the country in which you are operating I should think that four guns would be as many as could be used to advantage. In infantry can hold the work at Tullahoma, which they ought to do from my recollection of it, I would take the guns there if of use to you.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

DUCK RIVER BRIDGE,

[October 6, 1863.]

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

No news except this. A man came through to-day from Murfreesborough, and says three small bridges and a mile of track are all that are destroyed. A number of bridges, &amp;c., are left. The rebels seem to have struck the road at both ends. No rebel force this side of Murfreesborough. A large Union force in Murfreesborough. Mechanics at work on the Stone's River bridge, a mile this side of Murfreesborough. The Engineers and Mechanics now are beginning work on the bridge near Wartrace. No rebels, but 6 east of us seen to-day. Scouts in and found none.

Yours, very respectfully,

J. COBURN,

Colonel.
