he trusted, calmly on the subject, and believed he
felt so; yet he felt a deep interest in the vexed
controversy. He had heard much said about pa-
triotism and courage from all sides of the House;
nor would it be proper for him to inquire how
much of it, on this floor, has often evaporated in
words. He would let othets form their estimate.
He believed that the people of his State had a due
pioportion of both. He believed that they would
prefer pursuing their quiet and honest industi y
to hammering then plowshares into swords, but,
if war was inevitable; if it was forced upon them
by the impetuosity of the people of Maine, the
imprudence of the Executive, the injustice or in-
jury of England, he believed he could safely say
that, in the trying hour of danger, they would be
where duty would call them, that, if a foreign foe
invaded our territory, at the far North or the far
South, then they would let that foe, of whatever
nation they were, sorely feel

SMITHSONIAN BEQUEST.
DEBATE  IN THE  SENATE,
January 10, 1839.
Mr ROBBINS submitted the following resolu-
tion
Resetted, That a committee be appointed, consisting of
five members of the benate, jointly with <¡uch committee is
may be appointed on the pan of the Hou^e of Representa
tives, to consider the expediency of providing in institution
of learning, to be estibhshed in the city ot Vt aslmigton,for
the application of the legacy bequeathed by Mr James
Smith'.on, of London, to the United States, m tru t for tti it
purpose, also, to consider the expediency of a charter for
such institution, together with the power  and privileges
which in their opinion the said charter ou«ht to confer,
aKo, to consider the expediency of ways md mean1, to be
piovided bv Congress other than tin1 said ltgicv, but m
addit on thereto md in aid of >*aid benevolent intention,
and to report by bill or bills m the premises
The resolution having been read,
Mr ROBBINS said that, some days ago, he
gave notice that he would take an opportunity to
ask leave to introduce a joint resolution on the
subject of the legacy bequeathed by Mi Smith-
son, of London, to the united States in trust,
and that he would take the same opportunity to
submit to the Senate his views upon th«tsub]ect
I rise now (said Mr R ) to ask that leave, and
to submit these views
The motive to this noble legacy was, as the
will expresses it, " the motease and diffusion of
knowledge among men " Noble, indeed, it wis,
m every point of view, noble as coming fiom a
strangei, with whom this countiy hid no pei-
sonal relations, speaking at once his high sense
of our merit, while it proclaimed his own, noble
in amount, and may be made effective to Us benef-
icent purpose, but, above all, noble for its desti-
nation—"the increase and diffusion rf knotiledge
among men," leaving it to the wisdom of Con-
gress to devise and provide the institution that
should be most effective to this, end It ought to
be an institution whose effects upon the country
wnl make it a living monument to the honor of
the illustrious donor in all time to come Such
an institution, I conceive, may be devised, of
which, howevei, at present theie is no model
either in this country or in Europe, giving such
a course of education and discipline as would give
to the faculties of the human mind an improve-
ment and power far beyond what they obtain by
the oidmaiy systems of education, and far be-
yond what they afterwards attain m any of the
professional pursuits
Such an institution, as to its principle, sug
gested itself to the sagacious and far seeing mind
of Bacon, as one of the gieatest impoitance But
while his other suggestions ha\e been followed
out with such wonderful success in extending the
boutidanes of physical science, this has been
overlooked and neglected One reason is, that
the other suggestions were more elaborately ex-
plained by him, there, too, he rot only pointed
out the path, but he led the way in it himself
Besides, those other suggestions could be earned
out by individual exeition and enteipnse, inJe
pendently of the existing establishments of learn-
ing, or they could be giafted on, and made a pait
of, those establishments But this required an
original plan of education, and a new foundation
for its execution; where the young mind would
be trained by a course of education and discipline
that would unfold and perfect all his faculties,
where genius would plume his young wings, and
prepare himself to take the noblest flights The
idea, however, was not entirely original with
Bacon, for it would be, in effect, but the revival
of that system of education and discipline which
produced such wonderful improvement and power
of the human mmd in Greece and Rome, and
especially in Greece Its effects here, I am per-
suaded, would be many and glorious Of these
I shall now indicate only one, but that one whose
importance all must admit. In its progress, and
ultimately, it would give to our country, I have
no doubt, a national literature of a high and im-
mortal character. Howevei* mortifying to our
national pride it is to say it, it must be confessed
that we have not a national literature of that char-
acter; nor is it possible we ever should have, as
it appeals to me, on our piesent systems of edu-
cation Not that our literature, such as it is, is
inferior to that of othei nations produced at the
piesentday. No; mediocrity is the character of
all liteiary works of the present day, go where
you will It is so in England, it is so in France,
the two most literary nations of Europe. It is
true, learned men and great scholars are every-
where to be found, indeed, they may be said to
abound moie than ever, the whole woild, too, has
become a reading world, the giowth of the press
is prodigious, but it is all ephemeral and evanes-
cent—all destined to the grave of oblivion Nor
is it that our countiymen have not the gift of
gemusfor literary woiks of that high and immortal
chaiacter Probably no people were ever blessed
with it in a greater degree—of which everywhere
we seethe indications and the evidence, but what
signifies genius for an ait without discipline,
without knowledge of H¡> pnnciples and skill in

Literatuie is now everywhere mediocre—be-
cause the aits of literature aie nowheie cultivat-
ed, but eveiywhere neglected and appaiently
despised I tecollect to have seen in a late and
leading periodical of Gieat Bntain, an article m
which the wutei congiatulates the age upon hav-
ing thrown off the shackles of composition, and
siys,ma tone of tiiutmph, that no one now thinks
of wi ltmg like Junius, (as if it was an easy mat-
ter, but heneath him, to wme like Tunius,) ex-
cept, he atids, some junioi sophister in the coun
try, corresponding with the editor of some village
newspaper The whole tribe of present writers
seem, by their bilence, to receive this description
as eulogy—as a tnbute of piaise properly paid to
their met it, while in tiuth it is the chaiactenstic
of a barbaious age, or of one declining to barbar-
ism, it is the very desciiption applied to maik
the decline and last glimmering of letters in Greece
and Rome
The object of education is two-fold—knowledge
and ability, both are important, but ability by far
the most so Knowledge is so far important as
it is subsidiary to the acquiring of ability, and no
further, except as a source of mental pleasure to
the individual It is ability that makes itself to
be felt by society, it is ability that wields the
scepter over the human heart and the human in
tellect Now it is a great mistake to suppose that
knowledge imparts ability of course It does
indeed impart ability of a certain kind, for by exer-
cising the attention and the memory, it improves
the capacity for acquiring but the capacity to
acquire is not ability to originate and produce
No, ability can only be given by the appiopnate
studies, accompanied with the appiopnate exer-
cises—dnected by a certain rule, and conducted
infallibly to a ceitam result
In all thecelebiated schools of Athens this was
the plan of education and theie the ingenious
youth, blessed with faculties of piomise, neiei
failed to attain the eminence aspned to, unless
his peiseveranee failed Hence the mighty effects
of those schools, hence that immense tide of
great men which they poured foith in all the de-
partments of science and letters, and especially
of letters, and hence, too, the astonishing per-
fection of their works A celebrated writer,
filled with astonishment at the splendor as well as
the numberof the Works produced by the scholars
of these schools, ascribes the event to the hand
of a wonder-working Pióvidence, íriterposed in
honor of human nature, to show to what perfec-
tion the species might ascend. But there was
nothing of miracle in it, the means were adequate
to the end It is no wonder at all that such schools
gave to Athens her Thucydides in history, her
Plato in ethics, her Sophocles to hei diama, and
her Demosthenes to her forum and her popular
assemblies, and gave to her besides that host of
rivals to these and almost their equals It was
the natural and necessary effect of such a system
of education, and especially with a people who
held, as the Athenians did, all other human con-
siderations as cheap in comparison with the gloiy
of letters and the arts
It is true, this their high and brilliant career of
literary glory was but of short duiation; for soon
as it had attained its meridian blaze, it was sud-
denly arrested; for the tyrant came and laid the
proud freedom of Athens in the dust, and the
Athenians were a people with whom the love of
glory could not survive the loss of freedom For
freedom was the breast at which that love Was
fed, freedom was the element in which it lived
and had its being, fieedom gave to it the fields
where its most splendid triumphs were achieved
The genius of Athens now drooped; fell from its
lofty flights down to tame mediocrity—to ephe-
meral works boin but to languish and to die, and
so remained during the long rule of that ruthless
despotism—the Macedonian, and until the Roman
came to put it down, and to merge Gieece in the
Roman empire Athens now was partially re-
stored again to fieedom Her schools, which
had been closed, or which had existed only in
form, revived with something of their former ef-
fect They again gave forth some works worthy
of their former fame, though of less transcendant
ment, and they now gave to Rome the Roman
eloquence and literature
Gracia capta serum Victorem cepit, et artes
Intulit agre=ti satio
and, if we aie wise to profit by their example,
may yet give to us an equal eloquence and litera-
ture
I mention these things to show what encour-
agement we have to this enteipnse—what well
gi ounded hope of success. We have only to tread
the path that led the Athenian to his glory, and
open that path to the youth of our country AH
the animating influences of freedom exist herein
still greater force than they existed theie, foi,
while it is not less absolute heie, it is better reg-
ulated—better combined with order and security.
Neither is the gift of genius wanting here, the
gleams of this precious ore are seen to bieak out
heie and there all over the suiface of oui society,
the animus acer et subhmis is daily displayed by
our countrymen in all the forms of daring and en-
terprise, the eagle, their emblem, is not more dar-
ing in his flights And if the love of fame, which
was the ruling passion of the Gieek, is not now
so strong with us, it is because the want of the
means, the want of plain and suie directions fur
its pursuits, begets a despair of its attainment
The Gieek had these means, had these plain and
sure directions, and it was tbe certainty of suc-
cess, by peiseverance and by their guide, that
kindled and sustained his passion, and made it his
ruling passion This passion is now burning m
in theyoungbosomsofthonsandsofoui youth,but
it is, as I have said, tusconsih ear/iers, and struggles
in vain, because it struggles blindly for the fame
it pints after Let this Athenian mode of educa-
tion be adopted in this instance, let it produce but
a few examples of eminent success, (as I have no
doubt it speedily would,) and thousinds would
rush to the path that had led to that success, and
members now of this body are yet young enough
to live to sec a new eia aiismg in oui land—in-
other golden age of httiatute, no less splendid
than any that hid gone befoie it—not exceptn g
even the Athemm
I knowithasbeen supposed that the Athenians
had something peculiar in theirgemus,which gave
to them their unpan lleled success But we have
seen that when, with the loss of freedom, they lost
