RICHMOND, VA., April 14, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to return inclosed letters to you of Mr. McRae, of 12th and 19th of February last. * They were referred to me by you for examination, and I beg to report as follows:

On the 14th of September last Mr. McRae wrote that he had advanced for the War Department, out of the Erlanger loan, Pounds 544,976 5d., and requested that warrants to cover said advance be promptly forwarded to him.

It would seem that the above advance was for the various bureaus in these proportions:

Pounds s. d.

Ordnance Department 167,044 17 7

Quartermaster's Department 156,190 6 1

Medical Department 23,662 5 11

Commissary Department 22,500 0 0

Quartermaster and Commissary [for

Crenshaw, sterling] 55,000 0 0

Transportation 120,578 10 10

Total 544,976 0 5

The last item includes transportation from England to the islands, purchase of stores, &amp;c.

In accordance with Mr. McRae's request, on 30th of November last warrants were forwarded him by-

Pounds s. d.

Ordnance Department for 100,000 0 0

Quartermaster's Department for 156,190 6 1

Quartermaster and Commissary jointly for 55,000 0 0

Total 311,190 6 1

And he was informed that the deficit of pounds 233,785 14s. 4d. would be covered as soon as the appropriations of the bureaus on this side permitted.

Now, in addition to the pounds 544,976 5d. which Mr. McRae had already advanced, it was understood that the War Department was still entitled to pounds 262,500 out of the Erlanger loan. After consultation with the chiefs of bureaus you apportioned out this amount as follows:

Quartermaster's Department Pounds 85,000

Ordnance Department 55,500

Commissary Department 40,000

Medical Department 30,000

Niter and Mining Department 40,000

Engineer Department 12,000

Total 262,500

From Mr. McRae's letter and statements it appears that all the bureaus except the Engineer have forwarded warrants for the amounts to which they were entitled under the above apportionment. The warrants of the Ordnance, Medical, and Niter Bureaus were all in favor of Major Huse, and seem to have been used by Mr. McRae to cover the advance under which he still was to-.

This use of these warrants reduces the deficit of pounds 233,785 14s. 4d. to pounds 108,285 14s. 4d. Since letter of 14th of September last Mr. McRae
