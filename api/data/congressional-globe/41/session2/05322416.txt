Prayer by Rev. A. J. Rowlans, of Cincin-

The Secretary proceeded to read the Journal

Mr. MORTON. ,1 move that the further

reading of the Journal.
LOSS OF TUB ONEIDA.
The joint resplution (Et. R. No. 234) direct-
ing an ipqniry into the loss of the United
States steamer Oneida was read twipe by its
title.
Mr. MORTON. I ask to have the resolu-
tion reported in full.
The Secretary read t]ie joint resolution, as
follows:
Whereas, on the 24 th day pf January last, the
United States steamer Oneida, when Joaving tho port
of Yokohama, Japan; came in collision v?itb the Brit-
ish Pouinsular and Oriental mail steamer Bombay,
and sank almost immediately w>fh the loss pf nearly
alt her ollicors and the groat6r partoi herprew; ana
whereas tho Navy Department has been unaWe, in
answor to a request of tho House of Representatives,
to communicato any detailed orsatisftetoryjpforwia-
tion touching tho circumstancesofthelossj boyondits
extent and tho number of casualties; and whereas
it appears that no lull, impartial, and satisfactory
investigation has been mado into the causes of tho
disaster or into tho conduct of the parties implicated
in it: Therefore,
lie it renclwtl, <{โข<;., That t)io Secretary of tno Navy
shall with tho loast practicable delay, order an inquiry
to bo mado into the particulars of tho loss ot tho
United States steamer Oneida and of her officers and
men, including tho subsequent conduct of the captain
of (.lie steamer JJowbay, with a view to nscortajn tho
responsibility for tho Collision by which slio was de-
stroyed, and for the destruction oi'lifo which attended
tho catastrophe, and rnako rpport of tho same to
Congress.
Mr. MORTON- That resolution passed the
House of Representatives unanimously, and it
is important to have iminpdiale aciion upon it.
I therefore ask tho unanimous consent of the
Senate that it be now put on its passage.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the joint resolution is before the
Senate as in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. STEWART. As this resolution only
proposes an inquiry, I should dislike to say
anything to prejudge the ease ; but I have spent
some time in an examination of the evidence
reported from the British naval court of in-
quiry at Yokohama, and I will simply state
that it presents to my mind a shocking case of
inhumanity on the part of Captain Eyre. Even
his own statement shows that he was grossly
culpable, that he was aware of the critical situ-
ation in which he had left this vessel. It shows
a rccord of recklessness of human life that
demands a careful inquiry. I desire to say in
this connection that our minister at Yokohama
displayed a great deal of energy and courage
in the examination of fitnesses and in bringing
forward witnesses, but the whole proceeding
shows that he was laboring under great embar-
rassments, and that there was an indisposition
to have the facts go fairly before the world.
I think it the duty of the Navy Department
to make a thorough examination; first, in
vindication of the honor of those who are lost
and cannot speak for themselves ; and second,
that the world may know if Captain Eyre be
really guilty, as he appears to be from the facts
as they are now developed, and that he may
suffer the reprobation of mankind. It doe<*
seem to mo that he most richly deserves it. I
will not go further into the merits of the case
at present. I hope a further investigation will
rather tend to relieve him than to condemn
him; but there does not seem fromthe evidence
as I have examined it any prospect that he will
be relieved from the just condemnation of man-
kind.
Mr. STOCKTON. On a previous occasion
I had the honor to submit to the Senate a res-
