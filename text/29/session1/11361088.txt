So the amendment of Mr. Cobb was rejected.
The question then was, "Shall this bill be or-
dered to a third reading?"
Mr. DOUGLASS inquired of the Speaker
whether it would be in order to move a reconsider-
ation of the vote b.y which the amendment of Mr.
McKay had been rejected ?
The SPEAKER said it would be in order if the
gentleman voted with the majority.
Mr. DOUGLASS said he had so voted; and he
moved a reconsideration of the vote.
Mr. RATHBUN suggested a point of order; in
' reply to which
| The SPEAKER, addressing Mr. Douglass,
j said that the vote on the amendment of Mr. Mc-
Kay could only be reached by a reconsideration
first of the vote last taken, (i e., on the amendment
of Mr. Cobb.)
Mr. BROCKENBROUGH inquired whether it
would be in order to offer the amendment as an
ordinal proposition ?
The SPEAKER said it would not, because the
previous question had been ordered.
Mr. THURMAN inquired whether it would be
in order to move a reconsideration of the vote by
which the previous question had been ordered ?
The SPEAKER said no; not until the other
votes had been reconsidered.
Some conversation followed between Messrs.
THURMAN and RATHBUN, as to the vote of
the former.
Mr. STEWART moved that the bill be laid on
the table.
The yeas and nays were asked and ordered.

So the vote was reconsidered.
Mr. McKAY inquired if he could now modify
his amendment?
The SPEAKER said not.
Mr. McKAY then moved to reconsider the vote
by which the main question had been ordered.
The SPEAKER said that if the gentleman's ob-
ject was to arrive at a point where he would have
power to control his amendment, he could not effect
it; because, if the House reconsidered the vote by
which the mam question had been ordered, it would
not be in the power of the House to reconsider the
second to the previous question. The Chair was
under the impression that there were precedents
to that effcct, and that a case of that kind had
occurred during the present session.
Some conversation followed between Mr. DROM-
GOOLE and the SPEAKER on the point of order,
Mr. McKAY inquired whether the demand for
the previous question could not be withdrawn?
The SPEAKER said it could be withdrawn by
unanimous consent.
Mr. McKAY. If a majority consent?
The SPEAKER. A majority has not the power
to consent.
A further conversation followed on the point of
order, in which Messrs. LEAKE, TIBBATTS,
THURMAN, and the SPEAKER took part.
