APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 15,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. Harrison.
Ho. of Reps.
piohibits the new States from interfering with the
pumary disposal of the soil, but actually takes
from them the privilege of imposing a tax upon
the lands claimed by the Government—a right
that has always been regarded as an inherent at-
tnbute of sovereignty These restrictions are
directly opposed to all that is contained in the
deed of cession, and, I contend, are void, because
not authorized by that instiument, nor imposed
with the consent of Virginia
That the consent of Virginia is necessary to
malee any change in her compact with the Govei n-
ment, is conclusively proven by the fact, that the
Government, wishing to alter the teims of the
deed, applied to the State of Virginia for that pur-
pose, and her consent was obtained Here, sir,
is the resolution of Congiess in which the apph
cation I speak of was made
"Resolved, That it be, and it hereby is, recommended to
the Legislature of Virginia to take into consideran m their
act of cession, and ret ise the same so far as to e npo t er the
United States mConstress asséml led to make such a division

Mth the re oliUion of Congress of the 10th of Octolei,
1780 "
Virginia gave her consent in an act of hei Le-
gislature of the 30th Dccembei, 1788, allowing
the alteration only which is to bo found in the
fifth aiticle of the ordinance Why was it neces
saiy to apply to Viiginit to have this alteration
made, if the compact wis not equally binding
upon both paities, and < ould not be changed or
altered without the consent of both ' If it was
necessary to make the application to have an
alteration made in one paiticulai,is it not tqu illy
incumbent to make ri similai application to have
any others made5 If the ordinance altcicd the
deed of cession, oi undeitook to extend and en-
large its poweis, the pioposition is chai to my
mind that not only is the ordiname void, so fai
as the alteration goes, but the oidinance itself,
supposing it to be ¡i compact, upon every aclcnowl
cdtrod punciph of (onstiuetion willun the Hinge
of civil and national luuspiiulince, is «Ko void,
for having violated tin soli inn (iigagim nts of
the dt ed of cession, which wi ic mm pcnU d, still
in full fi ice anil ofTict, and which wen pnoi in
point of time, and piuunount m its obli0ations,

Rut udmitling that the oiilinanci is binding  if
binding in pait it is binding fm the whok.and if
binding  upon us, so also is it upon tin Genual
Govtrnm lit   foi, aieoidmg to  the  doctiiuoof
some g( nth nun it is unallciabk without < ommon
consent, and this consent has novel  been givin
Now, let us test it accoiding to this doctuni, and
see h   w fir it is compatible with the change pio
duced in the Govcrnimnt by the adoption of the
Constitution, and   what an , in fact, the | i< lent
lights of the new States undei this unaltei able and
unaltei ed c impact      To show this point cleaily,
and the consequent es of  this piopo tcious dot
tune, I must call youi attention to a poition of
the fourth amele ol tins instiumciit
c  Ihesaid ternton and the States win hmav he firmed

I y the authority and direction of the Legislature of the dis
tnct or districts or new Stales, as 11 the original St tes,
within the time agreed upon by the United States in Con
grc&s assembled'
The mode here mentioned of levying and col-
lecting taxes is the mode adopted by the Confed
nation, and if the ordinance be unalterable, that
is the only mode now by which taxes can be
laiscd off of the new States The alternative is
inevitable The change m the charactei of the
Government produced by the adoption of the
Constitution, accoiding to tliedoctime that the
ordinance is unalleiable, did not, and could not,
t fleet this aiticle, because there is no clause in
me Constiti tion which specifically alluded to and
uUered the piovisions of this article, and the
Constitution of the United States, if it did not
affect the ordinance as an integral thing, did not,
therefore, affect it in any of its parts If it be
true, therefore, that the ordinance is unalterable,
I ask why is it you have not complied with the
provisions in this article, which you bound your-
selves to perform, and which was required of you
by all that is sacred in the obligations that flow
from reciprocal engagements ' It is you that have
disregarded plighted faith and your own solemn
stipulations
But this ordinance is inconsistent with itself
It says, in one part, that " whenever any of the
said States shall have sixty thousand fice mhab
itants therein, such State shall be admitted, by
its Delegates, into the Congress of the United
States, on an equal footing with the original States,
in all respects whatever " And in another
pan, it not only contains the prohibition that the
new States shall not mterfeie with the pumary
disposal of the soil, but asserts, in imperious
1 inguage, that " no tax shall be imposed on lands
the property of the United States " Does this
aibitrary edict, foibiddmg the new States from
exercising one of the highest and most unques
tionable attributes of sovereignty, place us " on
an equal footing with the onginal States, in all
respects whatever'" Is the power to ta\,of the
onginal States, limited or restrained in any par-
ticular Can it be done' Has the GeneinlGov-
ernment the power to lav even the smallest le
sti ictions on their i ight to do so' If such a powei
does exist, with what piopnety can it be said
that we aie upon " an equal footing in all respects
whatever with the original States'" The piac
tical explanation which you have given of this
stipulation, lenders it supremely ridiculous to
eveiy intelligent and disinterested mind
As the Ai tides of Confedeiation expired with
the birth of the Constitution, it becomes a grave
question how far the adoption of the Constitution
aflcctcd the condition of things which existed
under the Confederation That the change most
materially affected the relative powcisand rights
of the States and the Federal Govonmcnt, will
not be disputed The ] oweis of the i ederal Gov
eminent,like those undei the Confedeiation, being
gi mud only, weie gicatly cnlaiged 'Unit the
change which the foimation of the Constitution
pioduccd in the chancier of the 1 cd< lal Govern
mint, altered also the natuii of the lclations
which subsisted with the Government undei these
leimpacls, is, to my mind, equally clear To
(ompielietul this lightly, we must takt a suivcy
ol the ob|Cctscontemplated by the change, of the
powois that weie granted the lights that were
alhctid, and the consequences that weie pio-
dui i d
ihe Constitution, like the Ai tides of Confeder-
ation, is an instrument containing poweis granted
foi sptcifn and enumeiated pui poses, only more
lull and exti nsive than those in the Conitdeia-
iion iln second aiticle of the Confederation
says
' I Kii State retains its sovereignty ficedom and hide
1 n lei t in i ev iv power, juried lion, and right wti ell
is not lij tins! onlcderali "in expressly delegate I lo tile Uiu
tc 1 Males m Gongre s issemblcd  —
—showing conclusively that no powei could be
claimed ot exercised unless " expressly dele
gated ' The clause in the Constitution diffeis
in language only     It says
' ihe powers not delegated to the í i ted States h/ the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the Sutes, are reserve I
to the Statts icspcUuely or to ihe peo} le   J
Both instruments contain none but delegated
poweis, allowing the exercise of such only as
were expiessly mentioned and enumerated And
Ihe pecuhai and striking characteiistic of both is,
I that they were the cieatuies of another power,
and had, and could have had, no existence until
exiled ioith by thejiai of the States thatfoimed
the Confederacy
jNovv , in ltfeience to the compacts so often al
Iuded to, had it been tlie intention of the fiameis
I of either to retain and exei else the povei of own-
ing and disposing of the lands lying within the
| limits, of t State   it would have  been expiessed
j m so many voids, in teims that could not have
been misapplied and language that couid not
have been misundeistood There was every in-
ducement to be explicit, they weie framing an
il instrument that was to contain a grant of powers
for specific and enumerated purposes, and weie,
at the same time, embodying in the same mstru
ment the powers that were necessary to carry out
and accomplish the great objects for which the
Confederacy was foimed
If it was intended that the General Govern-
ment should hold a property in the soil within
the limits of a State, how easily could it have
been so expressed, especially as the ninth aiticle
of the Confederation had prohibited the teintoiy
of any State being taken foi the benefit of the
United States This was a strong leason why,
if they meant that such a power should belong
to the Tedeial Government, it should have been
expressed plainly and unequivocally m the Con
stitution as one of the powers belonging to the
Government
In fixing and defining the giants and limita-
tions of power between the two, could anything
have been more just and prudent than the expli-
cit avowal on the part of the fiamers of the Con-
stitution, that this was a necessary power, and
should belong to the Federal Government' Cer-
tainly pot And the omission to make this one
of the specific and enumerated grants of power,
is conclusive that it was not asked for, and never
was intended to be claimed
I have thus, so fai as íelates to the grant of
the power in question, been leasomngfiom anal-
ogy I will now recur to histoncal facts to show
that it ncvei was the intention of the fuhetsof
the country to give such a powei to the Fedeial
Government as the one now claimed
In the redcial Convention, when discussintr the
piopnety of admitting new States into the Union,
and fixing the teims upon which they should be
admitted, propositions to give the powei now
claimed weie submitted and lejected Regarding
the debates that took place, and the vanous piop-
ositions that were submitted m the Convention,
as a propci, and poihaps the best, exponent ue
can get, in all doubtful questions, as to the real
intention and meaning oi the Convention, I will
now trouble the House with a few extiaets fiom
the Journals of that body to sh w that I am col-
lect in the positions I hive taken It is well
known, as a historical fact, that Maiyland ob-
jected to coming into the Union for seveial lea-
sons, and did not come into the Union until all
the othcis had joined it One of the propositions
made by this State, which had been laiscd as an
objection on hei pait, and which was submitted
to the Convention which formed the Constitution
ot the United States, is this
' Tiie I igi httlire of the. Un ted Mates "hall iiave power
to erect n< w Stues within as well ns without ih t ntory
claimed b\ tin several Stan , oi either ot them and liiut
the sime nit) tin Union Pronlcd lliat iKlt n.r in tins
1 onstitution shall be construe I to j/ecl tí e elal n of the U it
te t States to vacant lands cede I to them by the late It eatij of
peace   J
Hue \vc have a bioad proposition, oompie-
hending in its scope all that is now claimed a
proposition clear in us object, plain in its terms,
and direct m its meaning liad it been adopted,
the question as to the propel ty of the United
States, in the lands lying within the limits of the
ni w States, would have been definitively settled
Ii it had been the intention to give the power which
is now claimed, why was it rejected' Is more posi-
tive evidence wanting of the intention of the Con-
vention than this' 1 oi, if they intended to confer
such a power upon the Federal Government, why
reject the identical proposition which undertook
to give it' It is impossible to bring stronger tes-
timony to show thai the powers over the new
States, mentioned m the oidinance, weie not in-
tended to be embraced in the Constitution And
therefore I say the change pioduccd by the adop-
tion of the Constitution in the character of the
Government, annulled and set aside this ordi-
nance
But let us trace a little fuither the proceedings
of the convention on this subject, and it will be
seen that eveiy step coiroboiates  my position
On the same d ty it was moved and seconded to
add the following clause
" Nor shall an State be f raied by the junct o i of t vo
or moie btates < r pirts there f u thojt the coi entoftlc
T eBi latine oí sue i btate , as well as oí the LeBi i uure of
the United fetates
Upon which it was moved to add the following:
" Provided, nevertheless, That nothing m tins Constitu
