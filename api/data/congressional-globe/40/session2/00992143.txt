THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
obstacles and dangers so very large a vote was
"cast. Nothing less than the conviction of the
people that their freedom or slavery depended
upon the ballot could have induced so many
to risk all present dangers and to overcome
all surmountable obstacles in order to vote.
In spite of every difficulty the vote, as just
â€¢announced by General Grant, stands, as I said,
-more than seventy thousand for the constitution
and less than two thousand against it! Yet
gentleman say it is defeated ; not, be it remem-
bered, because there are not votes enough in
its favor to carry it, but because there are not
enough against it 1 For all admit that if there
had been ten or twenty or forty or even sixty
thousand more votes cast against it than there
were, and not another in its favor, it would
have been carried triumphantly !
Sir, this most astonishing effect of the vote
results from our blunder and not from the fault
of the loyal people of Alabama. And shall
they be made to suffer from our mistake? How
can we, how dare we, refuse our assent to the
petition of these people, and in consequence
of a technical failure, if even such there be,
to comply with this absurd provision of our
own act, turn them over to the tender mercies
of their rebel enemies?
Mr. Speaker, the evidence before us shows
conclusively to my mind, and I am sure to
every unprejudiced mind in this House who
will examine it, that a clear majority of the
living and resident voters of the State did, in
the face of such obstacles and dangers as are
inconceivable to those not so circumstanced,
vote at that election", and for the constitution.
Being satisfied, therefore, beyond a doubt that
the spirit of the reconstruction law has been
fully complied with, and its letter even sub-
stantially so, I shall vote for the bill.
Mr. KERR obtained the floor.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. I desire
that an order shall be made to print what I
shall offer to-morrow as an amendment to the
bill.
Mr. KERR. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I have no objection
to its being printed, but there are two amend-
ments now pending.
The SPEAKER. One is in the nature of a
substitute, and the other is an amendment to
the original bill.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. Mine is
an amendment to one section of the bill.
The SPEAKER. It is an amendment to
strike out all after a part of the second section

Mr. PAINE. If agreeable to the gentle-

that motion. I desire to suggest that the
numerous affidavits that have Seen referred to

matter is disposed of. I hope the gentleman
will consent that an order shall be made for the
printing of those affidavits.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I have no objection,
but I doubt if they can be printed by to-
morrow.
The SPEAKER. The Chair wopld suggest
that the bill and amendments will first be
printed. That is the rule at the Government
Printing Office; and then the affidavits will be
printed if there is time.
Mr. KERR. I think they can be printed.
The SPEAKER. The order to print will be
made if there be no objection. The Chair
hears none, and the Clerk will send an order
to the Printing Office to have them printed by
to-morrow.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I wish to state that
I desire to call for a vote on this bill to-
morrow.
The SPEAKER. At what time ?
Sir. FARNSWORTH. Can it be discussed
during the morning hour?
The SPEAKER. To-morrow is private bill
day, and unless the House by a majority vote
should set aside private business this bill will
not come up until after the morning hour.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Then I will ask the
previous question at half past three o'clock to-
morrow, so that we can get the vote by half
past four.
Mr. ELD RIDGE. I move that the morning
hour be dispensed with to-morrow.
The SPEAKER. That cannot be done until
the day arrives.
Mr. KERR. I now yield to gentlemen who
desire to introduce some bills, and then for a
motion to adjourn.
