MAY 5, 1864.

General C. GRIFFIN:

GENERAL: I hear firing on the left of our line. I think it is Sweitzer's line. If General Crawford has moved out we have no connection on the left; in that case the left should be re-enforced. General Warren orders me to keep the skirmish line out until the corps is well under way. They enemy's infantry are forming line of battle on the right and left of the Orange pike. There is a heavy dust in the direction of Robertson's farm, about 1 mile out. I would like a field officer of division to assist me, as I may have to go to some other part of the line.

Respectfully,

D. T. JENKINS.

Colonel and General Officer of Outposts.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., FIFTH CORPS,May 5, 1864-12 m.

Captain MERVINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The enemy have brought down to their former line one more brigade of infantry. I am ready to advance whenever General Ayres is. I think he is nearly ready.

Very respectfully,

JOS. J. BARTLETT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General ROBINSON,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you form in line of battle on General Griffin's left, to the extent of one of your brigades, holding the rest to be advanced upon the line, should occasion require. General Wadsworth will connect with your left, and his left will connect with General Crawford's right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
