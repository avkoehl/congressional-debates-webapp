HEADQUARTERS,October 7, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

City Point:

I have ordered my dispatch to General Grant to be duplicated to you. Nothing has changed since that dispatch. I have thrown my right back, put Spring Hill, near New Market, in fighting order, and am waiting. Deserters report no new troops in my front, but a large portion withdrawn from Chaffin's for this demonstration on the right. The force moving I make out to be Law's, Benning's, and Gregg's brigades infantry, a battalion of artillery, and Lomax's brigade of cavalry. The shelling of Fort Harrison still goes on with vigor. If I can learn with a little more certainty about this movement on my right I shall take the offensive with two divisions of Birney's.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

I will direct the operator to take off at City Point any dispatch I may send to General Grant.

B. F. BUTLER.
