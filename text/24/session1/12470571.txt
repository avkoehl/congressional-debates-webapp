ot tin subject, and perceive not its great import- I
anee bunly no man who understands the sub-
ject would limit these enterprises, surtly theie
can be no one who does not ted a pride and
pleasure in our success, which has far suipassed
all other nations

by the author, his name is Holden It contains
a narrative ot his shipwreck and suffeungs, with
others, lor tour years upon those islands, of his
crutland barbarous treatment, and almost muat,-
ulous escape. I have e\ideni-e that his character
is good, and his narrative true. I wish gentle-
men could examine it lor a short time. I am sure
it could not fail to engage a deep interest. Many
others are still in captivity, still suffering the
evils trom which he has escaped, and many have
fallen a sacritice to their savage bai barity. \Vithin
a tew days we have received intelligence of the
cruel murder of the greater part of the crew of a
ship from my own county, called the Awashonks,
ot Falmouth, and the loss of the voyage, which
gives an account of losses since the spetch was
delivered.

all her crew murdered ' "
Can gentlemen listen to these unexaggerated
statements of plain truth with indifference' Can
the appeals they make to our feelings and judg-
ment be made in vain' I trust not. We hav e
every assurance that the enterprise would afford
the most desirable and useful information. The
information already obtained, though deficient in
accuracy, would be sufficient to enable the expe-
dition to find those islands without difficulty, and
having surveyed and given them a place upon a
chart, the information would be full A chart,
containing such information, would, I íepeat,
save the lives of thousands, and millions of prop-
erty Here I cannot refrain from again refernng
to a letter written to me, January 21, 1835, by
Commodore Downes It is so directly to the
purpose, and of so high authority, that the atten-
tion of the House cannot be too often called to it
in this debate-

found on further examination to be a continuation of
Palmer's Land, Iving south of the South Shetland I si inds,

be said in lavor ot a speedy examination ot this portion of

could go where it might not be in the way ot doing good,
to sav nothing of the credit our country would acquire in
promoting such an ent< rpnse
As to my opinion ot the c'ass of vessels best suited for
suth an expedition, t should unhesitatingly say, two brigs
or bark  of two hundred tons each md i tender ot from
eighty to one hundred tons A great many weighty reasons
might be given to show that il, in the same íatio, ve- els
were hi vond this size, the chances of safety and CAtcnsive

Hon John Reed, Member of Congress
The privations, difficulties, and dangers of a
whale voyage would discourage men who had
not been educated to contemplate it, and engaged
in it fiomearly youth, if most prosperous separa-
tion from friends for three or foui yeais would be
regarded by most men as no trifling privation. I
will not speak of the common and unavoidable
danger of the contest in capturing these monsters
of the deep, that would be sufficient to tiy the
nerves and courage of any man, but I moie pai-
ticularly allude to the dangers of shipwreck I
beg to refer to a short extract from the report
referring to a memorial from Nantucket.
" The memorial from the town of Nantucket fully con
firms every statement I have made in regard to the extent
of the whale fishery, although drawn from different sources
This memoiial i  not only clear and conclusive as to the
extent and value of this important business, but presents
many other important facts The memorial speaks the
mo t emphatic language to every patriot and philanthropist,
as well a  to every legislator in our country, in the follow
ing quotation
" ' The great and increasing extent of the voyages now
pursued by the trading and whaling ships into seas hut little
explored, and into parts of the world before unknown, has
increased the cares, the lt>-ses, and danger  ol our mcr
chant  and marine rs Within a few year , these cruises
have extended from fhe coast of Peru and Chili to the
Northwest coast, New Zealand, and the Isles of Japan
I! This increase ot risk has been attended by an increase in
loss Several vessels have been wrecked on islands and
reef not laid down in any chart andthi acquires a painful
interest from the fact that in mv ship  have gone into those
sea , and no soul has suivived to till their fate ' "
Euionean Governments, who desire to encour-
age and improve their commerce and maritime
povv cr, hav e given most liberal bounties and pro-
tection to the xv hale fisheiy I refer to England,
Fiance, and Holland They have offered most
liberal revv ards to our enterprising men to engage
in then employment, but their offers have, in al-
most all cases, bcci declined Our enterprises
have surpassed all nations, without national en-
couragement The nation shares the honor and
benefit of their success, can we refuse to grant
their humble claims for assistance '
I repeat, if the privation, skill, and danger of
these whaling voyages could be known, if the
extent of these enterprises, in all their bearings,
at homo and abroad, could be fairly understood,
they would excite the admiration of the Govern-
ment and people In their commencement, they
excited thi wonder of the philosophers of Europe.
They have since been watched by those Poweis
vv ith astonishment and jealousy Our ow n Gov-
ernment seems the last propeily and duly to ap-
preciate their tiue value The real cause, I have
supposed, was, that the business had been con-
fined to a small territory It is now extending
itself, and will be more generally understood It
has been viewed as a local interest, and therefore
not entitled to national aid, except to a very lim-
ited extent I tiust the subject will be better un-
derstood, and, if so, I shall feel quite sure all the
lehef and protection asked, and more, will be
afforded
Mr Chairman, we have appiopnated,and shall
appropriate, the present year, for the JSfavy, and
for naval put poses, a large amount—far moie than
has ever been appi opi lated in any preceding year
I tiust, in so doing, we aie consulting the true and
lasting inteiest of our country Upon this sub-
ject I beg to refei to a late report of the Secretary
of War, and approved by the President. It pre-
sents a statesmanlike view of our country—its
situation in íelation to other nations, and its ne-
cessary defense In most of the opinions I entirely
concui, and especially in regard to a navy. I beg
to read a short extract from the repoit
" But it i  upon our maritime frontier that we are most
exposed Our coa t for three thousand miles is washed by
the ocean, which ep irate  us from those nations who have
made the highestadvancesinall the arts, and particularly in
those which minister to the operations ol war, and with
whom, liom our intercourse and political relations, we are
mo t liable tobe drawn into collision It this great medium
of communication—the element at the same time ot sep
aration and ot union—interposes peculiar obstacles to the
progress of hostile demonstrations it also ofler  advantages
| which arc not less obv oil , and which, to be successfully
1 resistid require correspondingarrangcmi nts andextrtions
The e adv images depend on the economy and facility of
transportation, on the celerity ol movement. aLd on the
power ol an enemy to Hire ale n the whole shore spread out
before h m, and to sell ct hi  point of aft lek at plea lire A
powerful lio ule fleet upon the coast of the Cmted states
pre ents some ot the features ot a war where a heavy mass
is brought to act against detachments which maybe cut up
in detail although their combined force would exceed the
a sailing foe Our point  ot expo uie are so nume rousand
distant that it woul I be impracticable to keep at each of
them i lorce competent to resi-t the attack of an enemy
prepared, by Ins naval ascendency nnd his other arrange
meiits, to make a  udden md vigorous uuoad upon our
shores It becomes us, therefore, to inquue how the con
sequence  ot this state of things are to be best met and
ave i tod
" The first and most obvious, and in everv point of view
the most proper method of delense, is an augmentation of
our naval means to an extent proportioned to the resources
and the necessities of the nation I elo not mean the
actual construction and equipment of vessels only The
number of those in service must depend on the state of the
country at a give n period , but I mean the collection ol all
such material  a  may be preserved without injurv, and a
due encouragement ot those branches ot interest essential
to the growth ot a navv, and which may be properly nur
tured by the Government, so that, on the approach of dan-
ger, a fleet miy be put to sea without delay sufficiently
powerful to meet any force which will probably be sent to
our coast                                                          ,
" Our great battle upon the ocean is yet to be fought,and
we shall gam nothing by shutting our eve  to the nature ot
the struggle or to the exertions we shall find it necessary
to make "
Sir, I fully concur in the truth and appropri-
ateness of the above sentiments, and the fitness
of expressing them at the present time     I have
long entertained the same opinions in substance,
i  and often expn ssed them in public and private
I      We are emphatically told that our great battle
