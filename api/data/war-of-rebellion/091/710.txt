Major A. E. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division Cavalry, Present:

I have the honor to report that the Sixth U. S. Cavalry have returned, and now occupy the gap. They went as far as Rockford; they burned 4 barns, 4 corn-fields, and drove in 27 head of cattle. The squadron sent up into the mountain road has just returned. They saw a few rebels, but found it impossible to catch them. I have ordered the pickets from the Sixth Cavalry to connect with the pickets of the First Brigade on their left. The reserve of these pickets will be in the gap. Do you wish any other reserve post made to-night?

Very respectfully, yours, obedient servant,

C. CROWNINSHIELD,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Reserve Brigade.
