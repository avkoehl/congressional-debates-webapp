BUCKHANNON, July 7, 1861.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND:

My advance guard, under Colonel R. L. McCook, consisting of Fourth and Ninth, and one battery and one company of cavalry, has occupied Middle Fork Bridge, twelve miles east. Tenth Indiana has moved up in support. Headquarters and four regiments, with one battery and one company of cavalry, move east to-morrow. Supply train now arriving. Three Indiana regiment march to-morrow. Enemy said to be intrenched in force in my front. Cannot rely reports. Will not learn what I have met until the advance guard comes in contact. I will be prepared to fight whatever is in front of me. One of my parties surprised a party near Weston last night and took prisoners six armed men with their horses. Another party of fifty killed at least seven of the enemy, and lost one man killed and five wounded. Brought off all the wounded and the arms of the killed. Advance guard received the body to-day. The men are in magnificent spirits for a battle. The only trouble will be to restrain them.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Newspaper reports say that my department is to be broken up. I hope the General will leave under my control both the operations on the Mississippi and in Western Virginia. If he cannot do so, the Indiana and Ohio troops are necessary to my success. With these means at my disposal. and such rescouses as I command in Virginia, if the Government will give me ten thousand arms for distribution in Eastern Tennessee I think I can break the backbone of Secession. Please instruct whether to move on Staunton or on to Wytheville.* I thank the General for his commendation, and hope to deserve rather in the future than in the past. Please in the past. Please enforce the occupation of Cumberland and Piedmont. The condition of things in that vicinity renders it absolutely necessary to occupy both these points, and you will remember that my command does not extend that far. I cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity of holding these points. The Pennsylvania State troops now in the vicinity of Cumberland will answer the purpose perfectly well.

Major-General, Commanding.
