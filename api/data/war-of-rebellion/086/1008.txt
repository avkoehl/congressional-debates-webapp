Should the enemy pass by Mount Elba, in the direction of Monticello, the two regiments of your brigade at Mount Elba might cross the river and fall upon his rear, unless his force be too strong. You will furnish Colonel Logan such assistance as he may require. Lane's brigade has moved to Prairie D'Ane. The communication is addressed to you or the commanding officer of your troops at Warren. The officer in command at that place will read this and be guided by it, and will forward by courier to you wherever you may be, with directions that it be shown to the commanding officer at Monticello, or of Harrison's brigade if not there or it has not moved beyond reach. You will use your judgment and be guided by information which you will receive from Mount Elba and from Colonel Logan, who has been directed to communicate with you by courier, and will communicate frequently with these headquarters.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to acknowledge your letter of 1 o'clock to-day, reporting the enemy at Princeton. You do not mention on what road Major Poe has fallen back. A copy of your letter has been sent by special courier to Colonel Parsons, or commanding officer of such portion of his brigade as may beat Warren, with directions that he communicate with you at once by courier, and furnish you such assistance as may be required. Colonel Parsons commands all the cavalry near the Saline River from Mount Elba down, including that place. You will communicate with Colonel Parsons or the commanding officer at Warren, giving him all information of the enemy's force, movements, probable intentions, &c., and calling upon him for such assistance as you may require. There is no cavalry in this immediate vicinity. You will send prompt intelligence of the enemy's movements to he commanding officer at Monticello. It has been suggested to Colonel Parsons that should the enemy move by Mount Elba toward Monticello, the two regiments at Mount Elba might cross the Saline, and fall upon his rear. You will please communicate regularly and promptly with these headquarter, and state in what direction you will retire, if compelled to fall back. If you get re-enforcements in time defeat the enemy; at all events, aim, if possible, to cut him off and capture his force.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
