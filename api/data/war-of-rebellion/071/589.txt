NEW CREEK, August 3, 1864.

(Received 7 p. m.)

General KELLEY:

Mr. Whip, a reliable man, came in at 5 o'clock, and says McNeill passed his house on Patterson's Creek about 9 o'clock this morning, going toward Moorefield, with 100 or 130 head of cattle.

CLARKSBURG, August 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

I am entirely ignorant of your situation, and without knowing of what you would like me to do. Would the Eighth Ohio Cavalry at Beverly be more effective near the railroad? They are, I believe, about 400 strong.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CLARKSBURG, August 3, 1864.

General KELLEY:

Captain Woods, Ritchie County Scouts, reports 200 rebels approaching Glenville and Weston. Operator reports them at Troy, in Gilmer County. Wires are down between here and Buckhannon.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

FRANKFORT, W. VA., August 3, 1864--3 p. m.

General KELLEY:

I am here all safe. The rebels moved out of here about two hours since, seventeen of McCausland's men. McNeill passed up the creek eight miles from here this morning with Seymour's cattle with about 100 men. They are scouring through the country in the direction of Burlington, and are gathering stock, cattle, and horses; all they can find. I now start on, as directed by your order to Colonel F. W. Thompson. Lieutenant Kelley and his command are with me.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. B. JEFFERS,

Captain, Commanding Scout.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE DEPARTMENT,Baltimore, Md., August 3, 1864.

H. F. DENNY,

Supt. Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore R. R. Co.:

SIR: Your favor of yesterday received, and has been referred to Brigadier-General Lockwood to take such action for the further security of the road as he thinks required. My opinion is that if the injury anticipated is done, it will be the work of home traitors in the vicinity, and not of regular Confederates.

Very respectfully,

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.
