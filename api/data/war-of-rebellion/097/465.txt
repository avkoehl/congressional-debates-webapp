General McAllister captured the picket-line of the enemy and still holds it, taking 120 prisoners from Scales' and MacRae's brigades. General Mott reports, that the prisoners state that they came on picket at 4 o'clock this morning, at which time their brigades were ordered to be moved to their right. The prisoners will soon be here and I will examine them and report.
