slowly, and it will take a much longer time than was anticipated to get articles that are absolutely indispensable to the army unless the railroad managers forward supplies more rapidly.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 11, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALECK,

Commander-in-Chief, Washington:

I am compelled again to call your attention to the great deficiency of shoes and other indispensable articles of clothing that still exists in some of the corps in this army. Upon the assurances of the chief quartermaster, who based his calculation upon information received from Washington, that clothing would be forwarded at certain times, corps commanders sent their wagons to Hagerstown and Harper's Ferry for it. It did not arrive as promised, and has not yet arrived. Unless some measures are taken to insure the prompt forwarding of these supplies, there will necessarily be a corresponding delay in getting the army ready to move, as the men cannot march without shoes. Everything has been done that can be done at these headquarters to accomplish the desired result.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 15, 1862-7 p. m.

General-in-Chief:

I am using every possible exertion to get this army ready to move. It was only yesterday that a part of our shoes and clothing arrived at Hagerstown. It is being issued to the troops as rapidly as possible.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 15, 1862-7.30 p. m.

Colonel R. INGALLS,

Care of Colonel Rucker, Quartermaster, Washington:

General Franklin reports that there is by no means as much clothing as was called for at Hagerstown. I think, therefore, you had better have additional supplies, especially of shoes, forwarded to Harper's Ferry as soon as possible.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 16, 1862

Colonel R. INGALLS,

Care of Colonel Rucker, Quartermaster, Washington:

General J. F. Reynolds just telegraphs as follows: " My quartermaster reports that there are no shoes, tents, blankets, or knapsacks at Hagerstown. He was able to procure only a complete supply of overcoats and pants, with a few socks, drawers, and coats. This leaves many of the men yet without a shoe. My requisitions call for 5,255 pairs of shoes."

Please push the shoes and stockings up to Harper's Ferry as fast as possible.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Knoxville, Md., October 9, 1862.

Colonel C. G. SAWTELLE,

Depot Quartermaster, Washington:

You did right in sending clothing to Harper's Ferry. You will not be able to send too much or too quickly. We want blankets, shoes, canteens, &amp;c., very much.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp, Chief Quartermaster.
