Little Red at Clinton and gone down between White and Little Red Rivers; probably left Clinton Monday a.m. West wants rations ammunition, horseshoes, and men's shoes. I have ordered a scout of 300 men from Devall's Bluff to Searcy. The cavalry which is now arriving is all unshod.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 26, 1864.

Colonel TRUMBULL, Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

There is no doubt but that Shelby has gone between White and Little Red Rivers, with a force of 2,500 men and four pieces of artillery. The general wishes you to notify the naval officer of the above. Telegraph how many gun-boats and other boats there are at the Bluff.

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, May 26, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Shall I recall the four squadrons sent out this evening to inquire about Shelby? I have directed the gun-boat to start up the river at daylight.

M. M. TRUMBULL,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 26, 1864.

Colonel TRUMBULL, Devall's Bluff:

Do not recall the four squadrons; let them go on previous orders and find out all they can about the enemy. If they find him, they must attack him, even if in superior force, drive in his pickets, and ascertain his strength. Our cavalry has failed most awfully of late in that respect. I do not think he will come south of the Little Red; if he does, we must know it in time, and destroy his entire force. I want your regiment to do most of the scouting at present, leaving the others intact. Let the gun-boat commander exercise his own judgment; it will probably do no harm for him to make a trip up the river.

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, May 26, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have sent the expedition ordered this morning. The Ninth Iowa Cavalry is nearly all out on scout or picket duty.

M. M. TRUMBULL,

Colonel, Commanding.
