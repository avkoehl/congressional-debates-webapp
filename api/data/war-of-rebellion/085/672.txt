PAOLA, KANS., October 6, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

The following telegram from Colonel Plumb:

Government teams from Kansas City are in this vicinity, taking corn by force from citizens for the Colorado troops. There is plenty of corn to be purchased. Complaints are being made. What shall I do!

Answer.

Government may send agents to purchase corn, but not to take it by force, Loyal citizens must be protected. You will, therefore, order across the line all teams on pillaging excursions, nd arrest those who disobey.

Am I right.

T. MOONLIGHT,

Colonel.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

No order from the Governor to turn out militia. It will take three days at least to get them into shape after the call, and circumstances demand no delay. I shall call out my command, militia or no militia, face the enemy, and let the State look after itself.

Colonel.

Colonel T. MOONLIGHT,

Commanding Sub- District Numbers 2:

COLONEL: I have received you telegram saying you "would call out your command, face the enemy," &amp;c. I hardly know how to understand it. Governor Carney and General Curtis having settled that the militia were not to be called out just now I so informed you. The concentration at Olathe, &c., was based upon the belief that the State forces were to join with ours. That not being thought expedient, things resume their former status. From your telegram I am led to think that the enemy are in your vicinity and that you are after them. Let me know how matters are by return messenger. I inclose your telegram in the shape that it reached them. You were advised last evening that you need not change your headquarters. Permit no forage to be taken by force from citizens living within the limits of your command, and order all Missouri troops peremptorily within their own lines.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. SYKES,
