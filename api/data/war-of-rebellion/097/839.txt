WINCHESTE, VA., April 19, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Colonel Mosby asks for a suspension of hostilities for ten days to learn the fate of Johnston. He says if Johnston surrenders or is beaten he will disperse his command and leave the country. He has also already notified his men that they might individually come in and be paroled, if they desired. Some of them are coming in. The officers of his command, fifteen or twenty in number, yesterday universally expressed regret at the death of the President. Th people are all anxious for Mosby to surrender. If the authorities of Washington think it advisable to allow the truce ten days I should like to be notified to-day; otherwise ther truce will end with him to-morrow at noon.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

If Mosby does not avail himself of the present truce end it and hunt him and his men down. Guerrilas, after beating the armies of the enemy, will not be entire to quaarter.
