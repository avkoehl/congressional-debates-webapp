February 16,
State of Missouri, asking Congress to pass a law
to create a new land office, to be located either at
Jefferson City.tirat Versailles, in Morgan county
Mr. L. said that the memorialists represent
that they are subjected togreatmconvemenceand
expense, as well as lass of time, m traveling such
great distances as they have to do at present, for
the purpose of entering their lands. He thought
their request was a most reasonable one, and
hoped that his faend fiom Arkansas, [Mr. Ful-
ton,] who is acting chairman of the Committee
on Public Lands will take this subject under ac-
inous consideration, and report a bill at the ear-
liest possible period in his power Missouri was
now the largest State in the Union, and he felt
confident was the richestm natural resources, yet
she had but six land oiSces, while her neighbor,
Illinois, had ten, though she was a much smaller
State. The young and vigorous Illinois seemed
to have been always regaided by Congress with
a favorable eye, she gets donations of lands for
canals, and to aid in the construction of her rail-
roads, pays less revenue to the Post Office De-
partment than Missouri, yet has double the
amount of mail facilities, and has even threat-
ened the General Government that if the national
road is not made to Alton fiom Vandalia, it shall
not be made at all. Modest determination ' He
said the people of the free States aic unceasing in
their exertions to obtain what they desire, and ¡
present their memorials, petitions, &c , to Con-1
gress in the most business hkt form, which |
makes them more successful in their applications
than the slave States, who ask lesa, and do not i
take the same pains to present their mcmoiiaism '

Mr W thought this memonal mailed atten

concerns of the count i y It si tsfoith some tacts
well worthy of consideiution, among others, that
most of the casts of insuboidination and mutiny
