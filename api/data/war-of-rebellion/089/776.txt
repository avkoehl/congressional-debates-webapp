HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 2, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The provost-marshal reports 170 prisoners as received from General Gregg, including seven commissioned officers, among them Major Fitzhugh, of Hampton's staff, in charge of construction party engaged in building branch railroad. This number of prisoners is twenty less than Gregg reported last night, though it is not certain all have yet come in, as I have no report this morning from General Gregg. I propose visiting your headquarters during the course of the day unless you are going to be absent.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
