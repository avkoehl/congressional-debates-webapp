W. L. ELLIOT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cav., Dept.of the Cumberland.

CITY POINT, VA., August 9, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding, &c., near Atlanta, Ga.:

The enemy having drawn to your front most of his forces west of Alabama, can you not re-enforce from Mississippi garrisons? I will ask to have all Western recruits sent immediately to you. Your views about showing no despondency, but keeping the enemy, with his last man now in the field, constantly employed, are the same I have often expressed.
