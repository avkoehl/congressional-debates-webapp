I am now very busy on business connected with my command, still on the march and ordered for a review next Wednesday. I shall be most happy to appear before the committee at any time, but if you contemplate any elabovate inquiry into matters standing far back, I would suggest a delay till the review is over, and if you propose to extend your inquiry beyond May 1, last year, it would be well to advise me at once. I would have to send for my letter and order-book to Lancaster, Ohio.
