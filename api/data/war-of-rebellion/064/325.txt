HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,June 14, 1864.

General Fisk will promptly investigate and take such action in this case as will secure a decent respect for common honesty and property.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SEDALIA, MO., June 12, 1864.

ALL OFFICERS:

This line is now connected direct from Saint Louis to Fort Leavenworth, via Allen, Glasgow, and Boonville, and will be kept so connected expressly for military business. Commercial business may be transmitted or repeated over this line when it is not required for military business, but the line or any part of it must not be switched on the commercial line without the consent of the superintendent. Complaints of delays by the commanding generals make it necessary that the utmost attention should be given to Government business, and no commercial or outside business allowed to interfere.

GEO. H. SMITH,

Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 12, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

I have just received the following:

Colonel ROGERS:

Forty guerrillas crossed to this side of the swamp from Mississippi County and killed Mr. Hazel, a discharged soldier of our regiment, about noon yesterday, and then started south. Lieutenant Byrne and Toney are in below them with 50 men, and I have started a messenger no notify them of the guerrillas, and sent Captain Shibley with 50 men to try and fall on the rear of the infernal scoundrels.

HILLER.

These are the men who have been cutting the telegraph line, and are driven out of the swamp by our men. I hope there will be murder done.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.
