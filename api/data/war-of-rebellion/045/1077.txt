UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

HARRISBURG, June 15, 1863.

Governor JOEL PARKER:

This State is threatened with invasion by a large force, and we are raising troops as rapidly as possible to resist them. I understand there are three regiments of your troops at Beverly waiting to be mustered out. Could an arrangement be made with you and the authorities at Washington by which the services of those regiments could be had for the present emergency? Please advise immediately.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor for Pennsylvania.

EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,

Trenton, N. J., June 15, 1863.

His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg:

Your dispatch is received. One regiment has already volunteered, and no doubt others can be sent. Where shall they report, and to whom? To whom shall they apply for transportation from Philadelphia? Answer.

JOEL PARKER.

Permit me to thank you for prompt attention.
