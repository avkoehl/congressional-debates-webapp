HEADQUARTERS FORCES EAST TENNESSEE,In the Field, October 21, 1864.

MAJOR: Colonel Palmer, commanding North Carolina forces, will form a junction with me by 2 p. m. to-day. I will leave the infantry and some artillery at Bull's Gap and establish my line at that point. I will pursue the enemy with my cavalry and some artillery. I will probably overtake them in vicinity of Strawberry Plains. I will watch them closely and keep you advised of all their movements. Inclosed find communication* from Colonel Palmer.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS FORCES EAST TENNESSEE,Morristown, October 23, 1864.

MAJOR: My forces pursued the enemy to their fortifications at Strawberry Plains, where they met some re-enforcements; and from the condition of my stock, for want of shoeing and other causes, I think it prudent to fall back to the line at Bull's Gap. The strength of the enemy that left Bull's Gap was between 3,000 and 4,000, consisting of cavalry, artillery, and infantry. Permit me to call your attention to the want of supplies in ordnance department. By constant marching the horses have become barefooted and will not be able for active service until shod, and my ordnance officer has so far been unable to obtain shoes. I would suggest that if nothing of a threatening character keeps the troops in the upper portion of the department that Generals Cosby's and Duke's commands be sent here, ad I think we could draw the enemy out of his works, and if so could very easily defeat him. I hope the general will favor the suggestion. My command is increasing every day and getting some recruits.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major J. S. JohnSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
