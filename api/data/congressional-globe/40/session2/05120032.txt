The advantages to be derived from this plan
are so obvious as not to require discussion. It
would secure, as has been already stated, such
a distribution of the bonds throughoutthe States
and counties and cities as could not be ex-
pected if local taxes should be imposed upon
them. It would create an interest in the bonds
in States the people of which are justly respon-
sible for the debt, but whose early and com-
plete restoration to the Union is so desirable
and important) and would give to them needed
aid in their efforts to build up again their own
prostrate credit. It would put an end to all
discussions and doubts in regard to the kind
of currency in which the bonds are to be paid,
to all complaints of exclusive privileges, and
place the public credit on a basis worthy a na-
tion whose resources, young as it is, are second
to those of no other nation, and of whose
future resources the present are but an indica-
tion.
The bonds, the issue of which is thus rec-
ommended, would be six per cents to the
Government and five per cents to the holders,
which is as low a rate of interest as can be
expected to prevail in the United States for
many years to come. Of the practicability of
converting the outstanding obligations of the
Government into this consolidated debt at an
early day, at no considerable expense, the
Secretary entertains no doubt.
It is therefore respectfully recommended
that the act of March 3, 18G5, be so amended
as to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury
to issue six per cent, gold-bearing bonds7 to be
known as the Consolidated Debt of the United
States^having twenty years to run and redeem-
able, if it may be thought advisable, at an earlier
day, to be exchanged at par for any and all
other obligations of the Government—one
sixth part of the interest on which, in lieu of
all other taxes, at each semi-annual payment,
• shall be reserved by the Government and paid
over to the States according to population.

debt on the 1st of July, 1SG7:

tion ol the debt may be continued.
