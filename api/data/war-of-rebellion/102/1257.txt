HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,New Orleans, November 20, 1865-1. 30 a. m.

(Received 9 a. m. 22nd.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: The Liberal force withdrew about six miles from Matamoras on the 7th instant, but I have reason to believe that they have again attacked the place. We have been subjected to the most violent abuse by the Imperial newspaper in Matamoras. It constantly calls the President the murderer of Mrs. Surratt. Some of our soldiers who were visiting Matamoras were arrested and put to work upon their fortifications and our officers and men fired upon by their gun-boats. The most insulting letters from French officials have been addressed to General Weitzel and other officers, and all this by a small force, which our troops could drive out of Matamoras by firing over their boats. The consequence is, much excitement on the part of our soldiers and a great desire on the part of the colored troops to go to that country if discharged. The commandant of the Imperial troops in Matamoras is always ready a with an apology. I have given notice that hereafter apologies for these insults will not be received.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
