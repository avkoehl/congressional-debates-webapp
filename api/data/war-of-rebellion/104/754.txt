HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, May 13, 1865.

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,Knoxville:

Colonel Wheeler, with his command, will not be permitted to go in a body into Middle Tennessee. It is not understood here that any such agreement was entered into between Generals Johnston and Sherman which was ratified. Moreover, the horses upon which the soldiers are mounted are supposed to have belonged to the Confederate Government, and of course now belong to the United States. You will examine their papers and parole such as do not bear with them evidence of having been paroled, and compel them to disband before coming farther into this State. Keep lists of such as you parole, and forward them to provost-marshal-general, Department of the Cumberland, at this place.

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES, Asheville, N. C., May 13, 1865.

Captain W. W. DEANE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I am this moment in receipt of your communication of the 12th instant stating that Colonel Hawley reports that in the surrender of the troops of General Martin's command Colonel Thomas was allowed upon some pretext to exempt one battalion from said surrender. General Hawley is mistaken in the facts of the case. General Martin's command consisted of Thomas' Legion only, which comprised one regiment and two battalions, one of which battalions was an Indian one. These were surrender to me and have been paroled. The arms are now being collected. General Martin and Colonel Thomas both informed me that this battalion of Indians was the only which was or had been in the employ of the so-called Confederate States Government for more than a year.
