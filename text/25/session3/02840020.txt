custom-house at this place. From them, with the
information derived ñora Mr Phillips, the assistant
cashier, we have ascertained, as we believe cor-
rectly, the sums withdrawn by Mr Swartwout
from tne public moneys under his charge, during
each successive quarter of his official term, and
never replaced. A summary statemei t, exhibiting
this in detail, has been drawn out by Mr Under-
wood, and is among the documents tiansmitted to
you herewith
The amount, aa settled at the Treasury on the
10th instant, exhibits a balance due from Mr
Swartwout, exclusive of interest, of §1,344,119 65
It is supposed that a further adjustment of his
accounts, and the production ot the formal and
necessary vouchers for sums for which he may
be entitled to credit, will authorize a further allow-
ance of $148,413 96 This will make the sum
with which he is chargeable $1,225,705 G9, exclu-
sive of interest. This is the amount that he appears
to have withdrawn and nevei replaced
According to the statement of Mr Ogden and
Mr. Phillips, heretofore mentioned to you, and
subsequently confirmed by them in writing as well
as verbally, the use of the public money com-
menced as early as the close of 1829, oi the begin-
ning of 1830, the practice being to transfei at the
commencement of the week, to the Treasurer of
the United States, no more than the amount íe-
ceived previous to Saturday morning, and thus to
replace successively from the subsequent receipts
the sums withdiawn, so that the deficiency might
not appear Though the sums thus replaced nfrpi
they were taken, can form no pait of the balance
now charged against Mr Swaitwout, which con-
sists only of sums nevei returned, yet we endeav-
ored to obtain fiom Mr Phillips the items of this |
sort from the commencement. We were unable
to do so. The original check-book of Mr. Swart-
wout from June, 1830, to December, 1831, through
which, perhaps, they might have been traced, was
not,after diligent search, to be found, and al'hough
Mr Phillips commenced, as he stated, in the year
1834, when the deficit began to be large, to make
a memorandum by which he can now designate
the sums withdrawn subsequent to that period
by Mr Swaitwout, from the ca"h fund for his
own use,yet hedeclared his inability to do so any
earlier The evidence, therefore, in regard to the
moneys that weie withdrawn and leplaced, is
found in the verbal communications made to us
by Mr Ogdtn and Mi Phillips, which weit given
in our previous reports to you, and m then letters
and written statements, of which copies will be
found amoi g the document  tiansmitted to you
herewith
We have ascertained that the ^,1,225,705 G9
taken by Mr Swaitwout and not repl iced, in-
creased gradually, fiom the fast quaiter of 18JO
to the end of the fiist quaiter of 1838, when his
official term expired, and that it was diawn from
various funds
Thedeficitof Mr Swaitwout,at theendof each
successive veal, was as fo!!ov\s
On the 31st"Decembei, 1830.......          $622 34
On the 31st Decembei ,1831.....       1,168 87
On the 31st December, 1832            ..     30,801 33

On the 31st Decembei, 1835   ......   137,00169
On the 31st December, 1836.......   3 lb 718 69
On the 31st December, 1837.......1,016,955 32
On the 28th March, 1838......1,220,705 69
The "tonnage duly" ¡s the fust fund in which
the deficit exists It amounts in the aggifgate to
$2,271 39 Of this there occuired in the year
1830, $622 34, in the year 1831, $546 33, in the
year 1833, §823 17, in the year 1835, 4J279 35
None of these sums are found to be debited m the
cash account of Mr Swartwout In the year
1836, however, there is a debt to that account of
$488 15, for correction of errors, leaving the whole
amount ot tonnage duty received and unaccounted
for, $1,783 24 it may be that this deficit has
amen from errors which have crept into the
account dunng the five years through which it
extends Tne amount is so small as to give color
to this supposition.
The " forfeitmes and penalties" belonging to the
United States constitute the second fund in which

there is a deficit.   It amounts in the aggregate to I

Of this there occurred—

In the year 1835, the sum of.........   5,343 53
$39,833 12
By the provisions of the 89th section of the act
of 2d March, 1799, the collector is to receive 'rom
the court all sums íeceived on account of fines,
penalties, and foneitures, for a breach of the rev-
enue laws, and he is to account for them quarterly
to the Treasury. The sum above stated belonged
to the United States, as their portion of various
penalties and forfeitures, and was received by Mr
Swartwout under the above provision. It was
not, however, debi'ed in his own cash account,
and though admitted in his accounts rendered to
the Treasury, it has never been paid ovei
Thiee "Treasury mm i ants," amounting in the
aggregate to $39,240 05, were received by Mr
S wartwout dui mg the years 1834 and 1835 They
were for the following sums, respectively
1834,  August 23, No 9,677......«7,637 21
1835,  Mav 2, No 837............21 895 15
18J5, June 22, No 993........    9,707 69
$39,240 05
Mr Swartwout received these warrants under
the authority of the 2d section of the act of 27th
June, 1834, to make up an alleged deficiency in
the fees and emoluments of his office to meet the
compensation due to his cleiks Their receipt
appears by his books, but the proceeds have never
been debitpd in his cash account, and their whole
amount still remains entirely unaccounted for
I Cash was withdrawn for the alleged purpose of
11 paying the expenses of the office, beyond the actual
amount of these expenses,, as exhibited by Mi
Swartwout's own accounts and \oicheis lhe
aggregate ot this excess is ^,60,291 42 Tne
1 application of this furd commenced in the thud
quaitei of i835, and extended do vn to the last
quartet ot his official tenn it is thus distributed
thiough the seveiul \e«is
In lb35, the excess of cash with-
diawn was      ...........«,6 368 25
In 1836, it was..............¿¡0 7nh 29
In 1837, it was................23,134 88
$60 291 42
' A single item, undei the name of " cash letained
I for refunding merchants," appears in the first
quarter of 1836 It amounts to $80,769 52 1 he
explanation given of this item by the auditor of
the custom house is, that theie were various im-
porters who weie entitled to the extension afforded
by the act of Congiess to those who had suffered
by thegre it fire m the winter of 1835- ¿6, but w ho
had actually paid their bonds This sum Mr
Swartwout withdiew from the cash fund, m order,
as was alleged, to refund to these importers the
amount of their bonds so paid, and to give them
the benefi's of the extension It never was, how-
ever, applied to that purpose, or restored to the
debit of cash.    It still remains unaccounted for
it will thus be seen that the sums withdrawn
fiom these five funds, viz tonnage duties, foi-
feitures, Treasury warrants, office expenses, and
cash to be refunded to merchants, amounted, alto-
gether, to $331,907 36 All these weie funds that
ought, mmediately on their lcceipt, to hive been
placed in the Tieasury of the United State-1, or
appropnated to the specific purposes foi which
they came into the collector's hands
The next fund in which we trace the deficit is
mu#h larger in amount than either of the pre-
ceding, it consists of cash received by the collector,
but which, according to the usage of the custom
house, that officei has Deen in the habit of letam-
ing in his own hands, under the designation of
"protests" and " deposits Joi unascertained duties,"
instead of paying it into the Treasury. The for-
mer consists of sums supposed to be necessary to
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
pay any amount of damages that may be reeovei ed
after Suit, by an importer from the eollectoi, on
account of his having charged a rate of duty higher
han that which is authorized by laiv", and where,
at the time of paying the duty, the importer has
filed with the collector a "protest" against the
duty chaiged. The latter consists of sams de-
posited by the importer at the time of making his
entiy, m cases where the necessai y calculations
and examinations to ascertain the exact amour*"
of duty require considerpo'e time, and the deposit
remains in the hands of the collector until it is so
ascertained, when the proper amount of duty is
paid by him into the Treasury, and the balance
returned to the importer It is evident that these
funds must, from their nature, constantly leave in
the hands of the collector a very large sum, the
amount íeceived or retained by him always sup-
plyng whatevei may be withdrawn to meet the
necessary payments, either of piotests or ascer-
tained duties
When Mr Swartwout's term expired, on the
28th March, 1838, it appears, by his own account,
that he was chargeable with $201,096 40 of cash
retained to meet "protests," and with $164,010 60
of cash "deposited with him to meet unascer-
tained duties " The only portion of this which
he paid ovei to his successor was $8,229 94 to
meet " protests," ieavin  the amount of that fund
retained by him, §192,866 46 In the deposits to
meet "unascertained duties," Mr Underwood
notes a small error of $166 44, making it, in
fact, $164,177 04, and thus exhibiting the whole
amount of cash letained out of these two funds of
"protests" and "deposi's," $357,043 50 None
of this ¡s now to be found in any bank deposit to
the credit of the late collector, noi has any pro-
vision been made for it The whole appears to
have been appropriated by him, from time to time,
to his private use We endeavored to ascertain
exactly the amounts of cash which had been suc-
cessively withdrawn, so as to make up the whole
of tnese funds Mr Phillips, the assistant cashier,
who kept the check books, from which only this
rsn be tiaced, h is given us a statement of such of
 he mms thus (ha vn out by Mi Startwout for
his private use as he was pble to obtain from the
ol 1 c eck books in the office and his own riemo-
) mdttms It emhiaces only the inteival between
November, 1831, and June, 1837, and amounts in
the aggiegate to S193 602 20 Of this sum, the
"ush noted by Mi Phillips as being withdiawn,
wa^—
h  the year 1834..............     $6,26120
In the year 1835..............     43,700 00
In the year 1836.............     97,84100
In the year lb37..............     45,800 00

In the enrher penod of these transactions, (tha>
is, from 1829 until the close of 1834,) Mr Phillips
wis not in the habit of noting the checks thus
used by Mr Swartwout, and he states that from
this nicumstance,apd from the loss of the check-
book of 1830 anl 1831, (to which we have ad-
vened,) he is unable to tiace out the particular
item*, winch constitute the tesidue of the cash thus
wi hdrawn The statement of Mr Phillips,
gtving the amount of each check so drawn, will
be found among the documents transmitted to you
herewith
It may be proper here to add a remark in regard
| to the fund alleged to be retained to meet " pro-
tests " No such fund, as we have observed, exists
in fact, it has been entirely used and absorbed
But, in addition to this, we were informed by the
piesent collector that such is the situation in which
the papers and documents connected with this
business have been left, that it is quite impossible
for him to present anything like an estimate of
the sum that may be required to meet the protests,
should any damages be ultimately recovered On
an application from the Treasury Department to
the district attorney, made some time since, he
gave the same reply, accompanied with the fact
that the whole amount of packages of goods on
I which the duties had been protested, and which
I then formed the subject of suit, was but six hun-
I dred and sixty.
