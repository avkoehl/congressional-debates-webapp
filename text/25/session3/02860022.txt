Defense of the Administration—Mr. Strange.
Senate.
as having taken side with the enemy In the
present matter, however, I believe it will make but
little difference in the calculation on which side the
" armed neutrality " may chance to be counted     \
My object, Mr President, in calling the atten-
tion of the Senate to the votes on appropriations,
i& to bring the gentlemen in the Opposition from
vague and gene al denunciation to specific and
intelligible charges I wish them to tot the mark
I am not ignorant oi the prejudice produced thiough
the counti y by this charge of extravagance upon
the A-dmimstianon It is done to a great extent
in my own State I wish it thoroughly sifted If
it is just, let i s justice be established, and all rignt-
ful consequences follow its establishment, but if it
is unjust, (as I verily believe,) let not innocence
be borne down with the burden of gaut
It amazes me that the Democratic party has
been able to sustain itself with all the disadvantages
under which it labors That it has so far done it,
is a cogent aigument in favol of the honesty and
intelligence of the people We are constantly
slain with our own weaDons,and our own punci
pies are used by our adversaries foi our overtlnow
Nearly all the newspapers throughout the com try
are in the hands of the Opposition, through which
falsehoods are circulated, and seen by many whom
then contradictions or exposuienever reach The
leading principles of Demociacy are deai to the
mass of our people who understand them, and
they cannot be drawn away ftom thursuppoit by
fan means The art which has been most success
ful, is the production of a confusion of tongues—
an obscutation of the marks by which the advo-
cates of those principles may be known from those
who oppose them fastening the imputation of
wanting those principles upon those who are most
zealously snuggling for their maintenance Thus
the people are assured that an Administration
which has gone furthest m the rescue of Demo-
cratic principles, from being overthrown and tiam-
pled under foot, is wanting in economy and ev
travagant in its expenditures All know that
economy is a cardinal feature in the Democratic
faith, and the Administration which wants it, is
wanting in its own principles if it profesc.es to be
Demoeiatic When, then, the chaige of extiav
agance is made and believed, it shakes the conli
dence of him who hears and believes it id the
Democracy of that Adminibtiation The conse-
quence is, an aidtnt, uncalcuI itmg man, who heirs
and believes the chaige, is apt in all the disgust
and indignation of one who conten es himself de-
ceived oi betiayed, to denounce the Admimslia
tion, and withdiaw from it his bupport, without
stopping to mqun e into tne motives of those wl o
profess to pcmt out tne supoosel abuses, and
whether a chinde of Adminibtiation is likely to
pioduce a reform It is uv a process such as ir is
that Opposition recruits are constantly supplied
Upon the same piincinle a recent aitifice is
being played off It his hetn 101 some UnK et
tied in the minds of the Democrat y of the counti y
that the Pennsylvania Bank of t ie Uui ed States
had been actively en^iged m the wuiaie upon
free principles I lie Admi inflation h¡ s been for
years engaged itt so den mncing i During all
that time, tne Opf isiti >n his been at iv ork to
countervail the--e denirtniois Ly lepre^enling-
them as alto.;  hei fals  an 1 £ ounule s But, in
spite of their tii uts, a large mtjonty of the people
ot the United ¡Mat s h ie ie uved these denun
ciations as speaka g lot ta the vvoids of truth and
soberness, and a current is now setting against
the Bank which can no longer be stemmed That
institution having failed, tl rough us hostility, to
overthrow tne Administration, an at empt is now
made to render its supposed attachment more effect-
ual A rumor has been lunning tnrough the
country for some months past that an alliaice
had been formed between the Government and the
Bank In this state of things, Mr Buldie, tl e
president of that institution, comes out with a
leUer,and much astomshmentisfeltand expressed
at the dissimilarity ot its tone from that of those
\< 1 sen have preceded U from the same source, and
many wonder for wnat purpose it was written
'I u this lattei question theie seems to me to be
bu' one resoonse—it is a pa*t of thesvstem—it
wus to give color and confumation to the rumor
of the alliance The president of the bank could
not come out and say that such an alliance had
been formed, but he could write such a letter as
would leave those who chose to draw inferences
to do so without blushing Ostensibly his letter
is merely for the purpose of announcing his abdi-
cation of the autocracy of this Republic, but the
important matter is the inference to be drawn i
from that abdication, and to give support to that |
infeience was the letter written As an abdica-
tion it must forcioly remind one, wno has read
Goldsmith's play ot the Good natured Man, of
Lord Lofty's renunciation of the control of affairs
of State Having pretended that he had vast in- ,
fluence at couit, and could dispose of place and i
preferment at his pleasure, he was at last detected,
and all his pretensions found to beutterlygtound-
less—when he philosophically exclaims "lam
'íesolved upon a reformation So now if any
' one has a mind for prefeiment, he may take my
'place.    I'm determined to resign "
The Bank of the United States has hitherto
claimed to have the currency of the country under
its control, and that nothing but its power and
skill could countervail the mischievous measuies
of the Government, but finding that this delusion
was fast passing away, and that events were has-
tening on the disclosure, that the movements of
the Goveinment had been in fact stripping it of
its ill-gotten powei, to the gteat promotion of the
general welfare, that bank makes a ment of neces
sity, and piofesses the resignation of a power it
never in truth possessed Listen to the tone m
which its president speaks
" Of the future it is difficult to speak, but in
' that future the Bank of the United States will
' no longer occupy Us past position Tne Bank
' of the United States had ceased to be a national
' institution in 1836, and was preparing to occupy
' its new place as a State bank, when the troubles
' of 1837 foiced it in some degree back into its old
' position, and it then devoted all its power to
1 assist in tanying the country unhuit througn
'its lecent troubles Having done this, its ex
' tiaordinaiy duties ceased For the future it ab-
' ditates this involuntary power It has no longer
' any íesponsibility to the Union, it hasno longer
' my contiover^ies wi'h the Government of the
' Union It now deslíes only >-epose, and if will
' take i s rank hereafter, as a simple State insti-
tution, devoted exclusively to its own special
'concerns
" I rejoice, too, that this new position of the
' bmk absolves me from many cares and dut es
' In the general confusion of public affairs, duung
' the 1 ist t vo years, it has been my lot to be more
' prominent than my own inclination prompted,
' and often to as&ume a station which would have
' bettei fitted others But public calamities justify
' the apparent forwaidness they tequire, as gieat
' dangers aie best met by defyn gthem My task
' is now ended, and 1 gladly withdraw from these
' lesponsibilitiex, carrying with me the only satis
' faction I evei sought in them—the consciousness
' of 1 avir ;done my duty to thecountiy as a good
' cit zax\ "
But n its expnmg throes, as the antagonist of
the Government, the bank yet seeks to wound,
and oy giving color to a leport that a reconcilia
tion had tal n place between them, cause manv
to withdiaw ii'om the support of an Admm'stra-
tion which had given the hand of fellowship, as
m gnt t e supposed, to one of the deadliest enemies
of Demociacy See in what terms of muendo its
piesident expresses nim&elf
" During these movements it became impcitant
' to understand distinctly the course of the Gov
' ernment     In rnylette- to you of the 5th of April
last, I stated my ' conviction that there could be
' no safe or permanent rest mption of specie pay
' ments by the banks until the polity of the Gov
'einment  towaids  them  was  cha iged '     This
' change  was soon and  happily made     On the
' 30th of May the specie circuíais, ¡equinng pay-
' ments in coin in the land offices, was repealed
'by Congie'-s     On  the 2oth  of June, the bill
' called the Sub-Treasury, requiring coin in al!
' payments  to  the Goveinment, was negatived
•In the month of July, the Goveinment agteed to
1 ' receive an anticipated payment of the bonds of
1 the bank to the amount of between four or fiv e
' millions of dollars, in a credit to the Treasuier
' on the books of the bank, and arrangements
' were made for the more distant pubhe disburse-
' ments m the notes of the bank These arrange-
' ments, as honorable to the executive officers as
1 they were beneficial to the public service, brought
' the Government into efficient coopeiation for the
' «establishment of the currency, and opened the
' way to a resumption of specie payments That
' resumption accordingly took place throughout the
' middle States on the 13th of August, and mmany
' of tne southern and western States soon after "
But to return to the subject of extravagance,
which has been, as I have said, similarly used, and
for similar purposes The Senator from Massa-
chusetts charges me with reading the Senate a
homily on economy, and speaks of my censuring
the Senate for its votes Now, this all rests en-
tirely in the imagination of the Senator I read
no homilies to the Senate, neither did I undertake
to censuie any Senator for his vote I only com-
plained, as 1 still do, against gentlemen votmgfor
measures themselves, and then censuring others
for the extravagance of them It was to show the
injustice of this complaint commgfrom gentlemen
in the Opposition, and that expenditures were
made principally by their votes, that I read the
record, which he has taken up and endeavored to
explain, so as to do away the force of my infer-
ences He takes up, in the first place, the record
at page 328 of the Senate Journal, and írquires
what there is to complain of here * Again I say
I made no complaint against gentlemen for their
votes I only said that this was a bill for the ap-
propriation of money for laying out a road in the
Wisconsin Teiritory, and, judging by past ex-
perience, the Senator from Mississippi [Mr
VVaiker] moved to amend it by inserting, "Pro-
' vided always, That nothing contained in this act
' shall be so construed as to imply that the United
1 States aie pledged, or in any manner bound, to
' make any appropriations in future to make or
' construct said roads, or any part or portion of
1 them," lest it might be used as a plea forfurther
appropriations, that Government, having com-
menced the woik, was bound to go on, and thua
entail upon us endless expenditures It was to
see who was willing to stop this leak from the
public Tieasury, and who for keeping it open that
this íecord was produced The Senator from
Massachusetts, in recalling our attention to it and,
to show that my inference is unwarranted, selects
for reading only a few of the names of those who
voted This, I insist, is not the fair way of pro-
ceeding Tne Senator well knows that his speech
will be read by many who will never look into
the Journal to see what, upon the whole, is the
complexion of the votes on each side He singles
out a ftw conspicuous individuals on the Admin-
istration side, who voted against tho amendment,
and from thence would have it inferred that my
proposition is disproved But my proposition
was not that none of the friends of the Adminis-
tration voted against economical measures, but,
on the con'rary, that a few were always found
with the mass of the Opposition, from local or
other consideiation=, voting against them, and
thus these measures failed, and the contrary ones
pievailed In fairness, the whole recoid should
, be submitted, by which, as I insist, my proposi-
' tion wojld be fully sustained     The vote really
stood thus
i " Those who voted m the affirmative were.
' Messrs Allen, Calhoun, Clay of Alabama,
' Grundy, King, Lumpkin, Lyon, Mouton,Niles,
' Norvell, Pierce, Preston, Rives,Roane,Robbing,
' Ruggles, Smith of Connecticut, Strange, Swift,
' Trotter, Walker, White, and Williams
"Those who voted in the negative were Messrs
' Bayaid, Benton, Buchanan, Clay of Kentucky,
' Clayton, Davis, lulton, Hubbard, Knight, Linn,
' Pientiss, Robinson, Sevier, Smith of Indiana,
' Tipton, Webster, and Young "
On the motion to postpone the special order of
the day for the purpose of considering the bill
(S 86) for the continuation of the Cumberland
road in the States of Onto, Indiana, and Illinois,
it is recorded in Senate Journal, p 844:
