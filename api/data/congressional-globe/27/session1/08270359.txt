Fiscal Bank—Mr. Huntington.
Senate.
have preceded ua INor shall I refei to the recorded opinionsof
enlightened statemen, piofound jurists, and distinguished con
stitutional lawyers—to the acts of successive Piesidents of the
United Stales—successive acts of Congiess—the geneial and
very aud ble expiession of popular sentiment I hey form a
part of in* history of the country, an 1 aie familm to us all
Waiving all these concert ring cuomstances, which furnish
overwhelming evidence in favoi of the powei oí Congress to
estabh h tre offices of discount and deposite-waiving also
every argument, supporting 'his power which may be denved
from the objects designed to be attained by the formation and
adoption of the Constitution—waiving too, the additional sup
port which the advocates of the power find in the words of that
instrument, as well as in th?ir obvious spirit, when applied to
this subject—I call the atten ion of the Senate to a single consi
deration connected with the point I am now considering, which
seems to me to be decisive, and which I think no ingenuity can
remove, do íeasonmg answer, no power of inflect overthrow
and that is, the bolemn, repeated, direct decisions of the Su
preme Court affirming this powei
Mr  Presidan, I approach this part of the subject with feel
ings of the deepest sensibility     lhave, from an eaily period
of my life, boen taught the propuetv as well as dut) of yield
ing obedience to the laws, and of the laws as expounded by
that tribunal which has baen created to explain and declare
their meaning    I have been taught to reverence the opinions
oftho--e who have been constitutionally appointed to declare to
me, and to all the people of tnese United States, the true mean
ing aid in erpretati in of the Constitution and l3ws under which
we live, and by which wc arc governed     The school m wh ch
I have been instmc'ed is that m wh ch has bi en taught the
safe, the just, the invaluable doctu e that the adjudication* of
the court of last resou are to be considered a*; declaratory ofthe
law and the rights and  dut'es giewing outof it, until regularly
set aside ¡n a iorri reg gms d by the Constitution    I have
grown up under thos1 instructions     Their value and impor

and what was tne conviction of my judgment in my youdi 1 as

early lesion*, of inestimable value imprinted on mv mind 1
come to the application of them to the case beft 10 us     And in
view of them Isay that ifany matter of once disputed constitu

Court upon any matter of constitutional law
B-utthe most serious onsequences whjCh would result from
permitting these a'judications to be dt regarded, °nd alio ving
the matters decided to be still open to hscussion have not been
mentioned I proceed to notice tlvnn U ider the decisions to
whMi I have referred, (and they are to be found m the records
of the court mthis Capitol, and reported under our authority
—I mean th^ cases m the SupiemeCouit siowmg out of the
attempt by the Legislatures of Mai yland and Ohio to impose a
tax upon the bank through its-branches,) lights of property to
a large amount have been declared and confirmed     Indeed,
m^st 0i certainly very manly of the titles to property m this
country may be said to depend, directly or mduectly, upon the
adjudications of couits, declaring the true and legal construe-
tion to  be  given   to   legislative  acts   and   to  private   con
tracts     Upon the implicit faith reposed in thece decisions,
and the moial certainty whichis feltthat they will not bedis
tuibed—neither doubted  nor overruled—investments of capí
tal to a large amount have been made, and a conscious secu
nty 1=? indulged in their stability and safety    Take away the
shield wl ich public virtue and the pnnciples of immutable
justice have thrown aiound the sanctity of these titlcb and in
vestments, by (he entire confidence placed in the stability of
the adjudications on which they depend, and little is left of se
cuuty foi any rights of person oi property    Such istheprmci
pie on which the vast amount of property acquired undei the
decisions of the Supreme Couit, declaring the act mcoiporat-
1DSE   the Bank of  the United States to be a constitutional act
ie ts fot its support      Transfers of stock were mae'e,   real
and personal es ate to an amount which can hardlj be com
puted, was  pure! ased   upon   the faith of these  decisions
The   titles to  many   houses,   farms   and   plantations, rest
with confidence m the inviolabily of judicial decisions     The
income  of manya widow  and  orphan,   denved fiom   this
unshaken confidence,   the  wealth of many of our citizen*,
the revenues of many persons retired from  active business,
and some even ofthe property ofthe nation   depend  upon
the stability of the dens os of this hish tribunal, the Supreme
Couit of the United States     And is it at this  day an open
quest on, whether these decisions are to he mimtamedi    Aie
the=e rights to be made to depend upon the opinions of judges
who may hu*eifter occupy places mthatcourt?   Arc the en
lol'ed judgment*, and decrees which have their foandation m
the«e decisions to be opened  and the point again tobe agitated,
di-cussed, and  decided   whether   the charter of the Bank
of the Uni'pd S ates, v hich lies at the foundation of them,
wis a char er granted by competent authority?   Surely this
will not be seriously contended by anyone, and yet it is dif
firult to peiGeive why the=e deci ions should be conclusive
upun  all the  rig! ts of propnety   end  Ire respec ed   and up-
held   and  yet the  only principle which sustains them—that
which affirms the constitutionality ofihebartk and its  bianch
es—is   to  be  legaided as   op„n   and   undtcided       Can u
be an op( n question whether the power exerted in the creation
offoimer uanks wa&a constitutional power, when it is admitted
that it is orly in consequence of the exis ence and exercise of
that powei thatthengh «acquired by the ad jJrcationsmade in
pursuance of if can be mai itamed    Having, then tl e repeate 1
decision^ ol the highest judicial tribuna5 of the nation, one of
who*,? appropriate functions it is to pin an end to all doubts
upon the question of powei, asser'mg and upholding it, we are
bound, I tin ik, to consider then decisions as declai atory of the
true meaning  of the Constitution—as   mcoij orated  m  ard
made  paito   tht Constitution itself and, inallcaspsto which
they are p operly applicable, to  be the supreme law ofthe
land
I might ston heie mfieff lence to this subject, pnd, I think,
confi lemly if'i m that in view of these s lemn adjudication*
and these alone, the questio i of the constitutionality of a bink
w thbranc1 es isnolongei men to debate Ipropose, however
to make afew   i ei =ngg"s ions conncctedwith this point, and
a^oin connection with die rest ofthe amendment now under the

to be given to then «ub-equently, by a S aie1? Aud yet the
essential feature of the pie^ent amendment is designed to ob
víate a cons itfcti nal difficulty growing out ofthe want of
power to creite a branch in a State, bv requ ritt-r its assent,
and thus confeniRg apowei by such assent, which, without
it, has no existence    It seems to me that if there be any such
constitutional impediment, it is not removed by the action of
the States in the way contemplated.
It is also well worthy of consideration whether the coaali
tutional right to create a Bank at al!, which is to operate out
of the limns of the District of Columbia, as this iscextainlr
íntended to do and as it must do, or else at has- neither the
foim, nor the shape, nor the substance of a National Bank-
does not necessarily imply a power to create blanches in the
several States, if Congress deem them necessary and propei
to cany into effect powers expressly granted Who is to
judge of this propriety and necessity"! Certainly not the
States If Congress may judge in these particulars, does not
the admission that it may create a Bank for national pur-
noses necessarily admit the power of establishing branches?
D d the framers of the Constitution intend that Congress might
make a Bank, as being necessary to the proper management
of the revenues, by way of collection and disbursement, and
yet not to be at liberty to place it where it supposed these ends
could be best accomplished? Might it make a Bank, and yet
have no power to locate it, or branches of it, except in this
District, the Teiritones, the dock yards, the forts, or the
arsenals of the nation The question may, then, with pro-
priety, be repeated, if the power to incorporate a Banfr for
the i urposes mentioned, be admitted, does it not follow, as a
necessary consequence, that the power, to place it where it
will produce the desired results is also admitted? And how can
one of these powers exist without the other! And is not
the argument which asserts that the power to locate a
bianch m any State, derived from the fact that the incorpoia-
tion of a Bank of the United States is constitutional, a sound
argument1
It may be added, further, on this point of constitutional
power, that the residue of the amendment provides or acts to
be done for, and thiough the instrumentality of the Bank,
which would seem to, imply the existence of the power which
\" denied of establishing offices of discount and depowte
The Bank is authorized to employ any agent or agents, or
bank or banks, to be approved by the Secretary of the
Treasury, at anv place or places the directors may deem safe
and proper, to manage and transact the business proposed as
aforesaid othei than for th*1 pu'po es of discount, <&c Now
it is said that these agencies can perform all the appropriate
functions ot a Bank, except that oí discounting promissory
notes They can deal or trade m bills of exchange, gold or
si1 ver com, or bullion, oi goods, or lands purchased on execu-
tion oi taken bona fide in payment of debts or goods which
shall be the proceeds of its lands they can receive moneys on
dpnosifp, thev can pay out the notes of 'he corporation.
Whethei, under this provision, they can discount bills of ex*
chinge, or buv (not discount) promissory notes, I will rot in-
qu ie Nor will I stop now to inquire whether it is probable,
if the amendment should prevail, the stotk would be subscribed
foi It is sufficient for my present purpose, to consider the
powerof these agencies to be commensurate (as it isafleged it
i-) with all the wants of the Treasury for fiscal purposes,and
ac si flicaent to íeaulate the exchanges secure a sound cur-
rency, and promote the general welfare of the country Ifthia
bp ^ if these neencieswill thus confer the benefits tobede
rived from a National Bank, if they are, in effect, offices of de-
pisite and of business, uniting all theordmary powers ofa Bank,
except that of discounting, and ifit be lawful (constitutional) to
créale such affennes, why may there not be added the power
also to discount, if Congress deem that a proper powei to be
ronreired onthe Bank1 Can it be seriously contended that, un-
der the name of an asrency, Congress can constitutionally
make a Bank having all the essential powers of a Bank except
one, and yet cannot add that power alsol They may make
a constitutional Bank, it is said, for every purpose except that
of discounting, and, as to that, they a e prohibited They
can establish an agency in every State, without its assent, to
deal in all things connected with banking purposes—such as
b Hi n, sold and <ni\er, its own notes, deposites, bills of ex-
change &.c —and yet cannot authorize the Bank to discount
a note unless the &tate consents to it lo there any thing in
the c7! counting of papet whicn renders the authority of Con-
gress over it unconstitutional? Can they empower the Bank
to dea! m bills of exchange, and not in promissory lotes?
Wheie i^ this distinction to tie found in the Constitution?
Or can it exibt m reference to the subject to which it is
appl ed"* If the power of Congress to establish agencies, as
being necessary and proper to the execution of its other pow-
ers, pusts, the same power for the same purpose, must ex-
tend to the establishment of offices of discount It seems to
me imprissible to separate them, and that the admission that
the one is confeired is also an admission that the other lslike-
w ise conferred
1    do not deem it necessary to add any thing fu ther on
t Us question of the pow ei of Congress to create aÜank, with of-
fi es of discount and deposite, fori thmkit is impliedly admit-
ted lv the advocates of that pait of the amendment which re
Idtes to agencies, and by those whosupposethata bank whose
operations aie not confined to the District of Columbia,canba
created, notwithstanding the proposition to requite the assent
ofthe Legi^atme of a State is a practical denial ofthe
power I think also, that the decisions of the Supreme
Court hive pit the point at rest, and that it ought not
to be disturbed     In addition to this,  the main stress of the
rgument mfav >r ofthe amendment baa been placed upon the
srourd of expediency not of unconstitutionality, and I pro-
p >sp mow to f xan me that bianch of the argument, and to en-
deavor to show tnat   it has no stronger foundation on which
i.est. tnan Mia of the Ions exploded and bmied doctrine of
the unronstitutiinalitv of a Bank ofthe United States

An! it is supposed that, by yielding this disputed point, we

w it hout the adoption of this amendment the hill'wrli not meet
tie approbationof the other branch of the legislature depart-
ment of the Government, or possibly may not find favor
in another quarter, and that ¡he country requires, demands a
bank—that tt has spoken on this subject in unequivocal lan-
guage which cannot be mistaken—that i' expects one speedily
