It has been ai I th "it this bill will oppiess the
banks—wilier pple them in tneu ability to accom-
modate the tmhhe    But, sn, how w ill it oppress or
mjuie them1 Gentlemen pioceed on the suppo i-
tion that if ine instalment: is paid, the States would
accept diafts on the d°nosite banks, wh ch would
be more convenient lor the banks , but ctherwise,
ihe banks are to b" called upon foi p i) ment
n specie, which tney cannot meet, and w th
th s demand upon them, they could not affoid
-ccommodahon to the public It may be true
that those States, where there ís'-ufíicent money
deposited, m ght accept drafts on deposite banks,
which would be more convenient for the ban' s lo
meet But weuld ihe States not so satiated ac-
ei pt drafts on distant banks, take then c'epieciated
paper, and ob igate them eltes for the repaynent of
the full 'mount' I think not But, although the
ba its are under obligation lo pay all their deposites
in sp cie if demanded and much of which has
been received in specie, the couise hithert ipjrsucd
by the Secretar), and the bill to w nich I before
alluded—should it become a law, slow con-
clusive)) tnat the barks nil hate txtei t'ed to them
every accom nodation co isistent with the puDho
m erest, m making payment of the deposites to the
Government Since the suspension oí -.peoie pay-
metts by the banks, millions have been drawn
fiom them b) the acceptarce of drafts, given to the
public creditors, in a manner satislactor) to the
loldes, without having paid a dollai in specie
And suel , doubtless, will cant nue to be the ca^e,
to a cunsioleiablt extent at least So, ihen, I am at
a loss to pciceive how the passage of Inis bill can
cupple the banks, and tnereby lessen their abil t) to
accommodate thei1- customers
Nov , sir if this bill shall not pas«, I ask go i-
tlemen opposed to it, how is the deposite oí the
fouilh ins alment to be made to the States? It will
not be c intended ihat you have th" me, ns in the
Tr"asurv at command Then how w 11 vou do it1
Will )oa bi^iio v the money—will you u^elhec e lit
of the Government fortius purpose1 Will you
íaise money manyrmmiei, either by taxation oi
on the ciedit of the Government, for the purpose
of deposite v ith the States, to be immediately called
back, or fn distribution1 Will )ou issue Treasury
notes foi this expiess purpose1 That is the way I
understand many gentlemen piopose to accom-
plidi this object I ask then sir, by what autho-
rity, upon what sound principles of constitutional
legisl tion, will )ou raise rnone) on the ciedit of
this Government for the purpose of dis'ribution1
I call it distribotioi tho 'gh tl e law cahs it depo-
site, for sue is th" expr ssed language of gent e-
men ol the opposition, and tne gentleman from
Virginia (Mi Meicer) said, when he voted for the
law he designed it as an act of distribution, he
meant it as si ch, and the Stat s had a right to
the money I take them, then, at then own e\-
picssed understmchtig oftnelivv, and again ask,
whence do tiu den c joar authority to raise
money foi the express purpose of distnbut on1
Will jou find it in tne Oonstuuti n1 Sir, m my
opinion, it would 1 e a palp iMe violation both of
the lottei an 1 spun of that sacred instrument It
would be i perveiSion of the obj""ts foi which this
Govert ment was foimed Gentlemen may cover
the design, by sauig the y laisc money to enable
the Govfcinmeni lo cany on its fiscal operations, in
whiel th s will be lnelutic I This would be a
roundaoou' «aj, ai mdiiect mode, of arriving at
the same obj ci With bo und r tanding of tne
intent ai d meaning of the 13th section of tne depo-
site act, as has been fianl 1) avoived upcnthis
flooi, it would b" indiiectiv dc mg «hat I am well
assured)o could never get a to*e oí th s House
tide due"tl$ and if it bad been upni ed at the
íme the deposite law was pas cl, tl at n wis to be
a distribution act it never coul 1 h ve leceivel the
vote of a mapntv of'his House oi tae sanction of
the then Clue' Magistiat" Ts u true, sir, that
the pow er m quest on is to be derived fi un
"the general welfare clajs" ol tne Constitu-
tion, as seemed to be t1 e op mon of the gen-
tleman from IN cvv J roe) (All Halstead') Wh),
s r, ta ce that clause m tmt stnse, and you may
make it cove any ind etrij thing that one can
po sib1) imigmc may be tur the geneial t eltaie
and with the selfish feelings of men, their notiois
of 'geneial welfare" aie too apt to een ie vov
near home     Every project, no matter how vision-
