these people can be used to our advantage by setting them a Part to fight steamers. They will trade with a steamer to-day and burn her to-morrow. Captain Floyd secured ammunition through a steamer, and afterward burned the boat at the bank.

The above suggestions are respectfully submitted to the commanding general of the department.

JOHN C. KAY,

Captain, Commanding River Rangers.

DALTON, January 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Richmond:

Clanton's troops should be dispersed and sent as far from home ask practicable. This army is too near; that of Mississippi would be better, beingk farther and in the same command. Clanton's incompetence is proved by their condition.

DALTON, January 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

MILLEDGEVILLE, January 15, 1864.

General A. R. LAWTON:

Our rolling-stock has been carried off under military orders and lost or destroyed till we have not enough to meet a heavy demand for transportation. I ask that you put upon the road two good engines and trains of cars in place of eight lost or destroyed by the military. We can then do the carrying for the army promptly. Otherwise I cannot promise certainty of transportation.

JOS. E. BROWN.

RICHMOND, VA., January 16, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

Yours of the 13th received.* The Quartermaster-General comunicated with the Governor of Georgia and offered every practical aid. The Governor has replied, asking for rolling-stock, which I hope can be furnished. My dispatch to you was intended to secure your influencing the Governor by a statement of your necessities and the consequences apprehended, involving the vital interests of Georgia. I hope the needful reforms will be obtained. In the meantime the alternative of short rations would be preferable to the one you present.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
