said to fall into the Atlantic Ocean This shows a difference in

fins language, without any change of sense, is tiansferred

I ot I need not again show tiiat this line was on the summit oí

" Bounded on the south by a line from ihe Bay ofChaleur,

Themattei wasdoubtiesstieated by the negotiators as itreally

like the Giank Bank It is impossible that those who drew tho

unless they designed to use language without any appropnate
meaning, for they cannot be understood otherwise than as mean

Butam hetself practically refutes all her reasoning for she

separates those provinces This line is always described as
passing fiom Chaleur bay alojsg.highlands which divide the n

from the southern side of this hue which does not find its way

well how to find this line, by tlusdesenptioi), and how to mam

But, obvious as these truths are, clearly as it is proved that
the provincial and the tieaty lines are coincident, yet I must ask
the in Ulgcnce el the Senate to lieffn for a short time to the
reasoning ol treat Biliam hei&elf on this subject, before the
1 ipacious desire r f acquiring our terrilcuy had bewildered her
understanding In 1794 a c immission Was appointed to decido
which among several streams was the 8t Croii ol the treaty
The Butish commissioners claimed th it the western branch of
the Scoodiac was the poipt to stai t the line from, which was to
run noith to tho highlands The American commissioner pro
posed the head ot the Mogaguadavic, but the main branch of
th  S'Oo liac wad alierwards agreed on as the river St CroK
named 111 the uMiy There Was, however, much debate on
tins point, and I propose to read some éxíifacts fíoiíi the etigo-
ment ot the Britioh commissioner to piove that he strentiousfa'
conten led that the province and tieaty lines were identical,
and that the west line of Nova ¡Scotl 1 did notitop short of the

and, further, that with these exception  there never was but

It would b^ difficult !< i me to And terms to express a more
de-uled opinion that the piovncial lines ol Nova Scotia re

tieii) and holds the following language, which proves clearly
thit tlie tl ought of finding highlands sodthef Ihe bt Johns, or
o tut entne iveí being assigned by the treaty of peace to

by me argument to piove the expediency of leaving tfi*
bttealrls u&ing n each country \vi l*m tint jurisdiction wheie
they r se as lai as possible, ard athrms that by starting tho
west ime of Nova S otn Irom tlie west bianeh of the Scoodiac
this might be aceom| Iished as to ail the riverb except tho át
Johns
1 \ line due noi th fi om the sotnee of the western or mam
branch of the beoodiac oi St Cioix will fully secuie this eflec 
to the United & í( « m eveiv instance, and also to Great Britain,
in all instances except In that oí the nvei ¡St John a, wherein
it becomes i npossible, by leason that the souices of this river
are to the westward not only of the westward boundary tine
o) NOLtl Scotia, butoi the sources of the Perohscot and even
of the Kennebec eo that this tun th line must of necessity cross
Ihe St John's but it  i'l cross it m a part ot it almost at the
foot of the highlands and where i! ecases to be navigable But
if a noi th line is traced from the source Of the Cheputnatecook,
i will not only cross the nvei St John's, Within about fifty
n lie  Iiom Fiedencton, the metropolis of New Brunswick, but
v 11 cut Ci tl e soaices of the nveis which fall mtc the bay of
Chaleui   '
How distinct and decisive this language is He affirms thati
if the Ci/putnatecook bianeh of the St Cioix or Scoodiac is
established as the boundaiy of the treaty, and a due north line
is lun from its head it will cross the sources of the rivers
icluchfall into Chaleur bay before it reaches the highlands
Them >nut lent was pi iced at the head of this stream, andadut.
noi tl line as he declared, does cut off the head waters of the
Ristigouehe bv extending to what we call the highlands of the
treaiy and GieatButam knew this would be the result when
she asreed to that nvei There was therefore, no disagree
mem about the highlands, but Gieat Bn am openly conceded
that they weie no th of the souices of the St John's and the
Ristigouehe    'I his. is all we contend for
He next pi oceeds to pro"e b it I cannot trouble the Senate
w th the wl olo argument, that the west and northhnes of fcova
Scotia, down to the time of makitinthe treaty in 1783, remained
unchanged and continued so after the rat^eation of the treaty,
the west line of Nova St otra and the sou "' Ime of Canada
being m fact tlie lines adopted in the treaty as tii^ houndanes
of the United ¡States    He concludes his íemarksíhus
"Can it be believed ot for a moment imagined, that, in tha
course of human evente, so exact a coincidence couldhave hap-
pened between ihe actual boundafjes of the Province of Nova
' feeotiaaml the boundanes of it de enbed in this treaty, if the
latter had not been dictaledandiegnlated by the formert
' Can any man ««sítate to say he is convinced that the coni
missioncre at Paris m. 1783, in forming the second article of the
treaty of peace in whieli ihev have so exactly described the
northwest angle, had reference to, and were governed by the
biunddriea of Nova Scotia as described in the grant lo Sir Wil,
li im Aiexandei and the subsequent alteration of the northern
boundary by the ei ection of the Province of Quebec "
This argument literally runs Oh all fours with us in ftsjead.
ing views upon the questions now at issue. It repudiates the
idea that the northwest «smile of Nora Scotia cannot be ascei
tamed, as well as the idea that the sources ofthe St John's aro
not designed, by the treaty, to Be in the United States It is
equally clear that the highlands of the treaty are north of all
