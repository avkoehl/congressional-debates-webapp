KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I already have three days' cooked rations in haversacks ready to march. I cannot put over 250 horses on boat. One of my secret scouts just returned from Parkville. He says the whole country are with the rebels. Not over one-tenth of the people are Union. General Totten, inspector-general and chief of staff, Department of the Missouri, is here. I will telegraph you when I move. My scout says they gave him information of just what troops I had here, and also that the steam-boat Fanny Ogden was here to transport troops to attack them. I have some lousy wretches right at home here giving them information.

JAMES H. FORD.

Colonel.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

General CURTIS:

I will have the steamer Fanny Ogden loaded by 2 o'clock. Has the Emilie left? At what point do you wish me to take my troops. Shall I start on the Ogden before the Emilie arrives? My command consists of 350 men, well mounted and armed.

J. H. FORD.

Colonel, Commanding.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City.

COLONEL: I just answered your long dispatch, which replies to your last. I will try to start the steamer Emilie to help you. It will do no harm if it does no good, but keep your arrangements going on.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel FORD

Kansas City:

Do you move this evening? If so, what way?

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Your dispatch asking me if I would leave to-night, and which way I would go, just received. Have you received my last long dispatch giving you the plans of Assistant Adjutant-General Holloway, Saint Joseph, and asking your advice; and do you intend to leave it all to me? If so, I will act on my own judgment and inform you, but would prefer to have your advice.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, &amp;c.
