You will find orders from General Lee when you get off the cars. Telegraph Captain Mayo, quartermaster, Richmond, when your brigade will reach the depot. Answer.

HEADQUARTERS ANDERSON'S CORPS,March 29, 1865-8.45 a. m.

Major General B. R. JOHNSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Anderson to say that when you are well satisfied that the enemy is advancing in heavy force on the military road, ins such strength as cannot be resisted, you may withdraw your picket-line, throwing forward at the same time a brigade in advance of the works to retard the advance of the enemy and cover the retiring pickets. General Andreson thinks it would be best to leave some vedettes and scouts on the extreme left of your present picket-line to look after the movements of the enemy and report them.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. C. HASKELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
