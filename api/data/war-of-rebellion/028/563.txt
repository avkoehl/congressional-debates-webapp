in so delicate a matter; although, if I had been longer in the service, and more accustomed to decide such questions, I should not hesitate, with the opinion I now entertain of the transaction.

I respectfully suggest that General Patterson be relieved from the command of the Third Brigade, and that an inquiry be ordered into his conduct.

Inclosed herewith please find copy of my order directing the forward movement, and copy of my communication to General Patterson late Thursday night, and to which he refers in his note. This was sent on my return from Catlett's, and contained the substance of information just then received through Lieutenant H. E. Tremain, aide-de-camp, from Headquarters Army of the Potomac.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN:

Scouts from Chester from Manassas Gaps report no enemy at either of the gaps. The last rebels were seen there on Wednesday. A contraband reported General Hill's forces to-day at Front Royal, moving toward Culpeper. A portion of E. V. White's cavalry entered Aldie this morning, and took a Union lady prisoner, but the whole party has been captured by our cavalry. Scouts from Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps have not returned.
