HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1864-8. 30 p. m.

Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Commanding Dept. of Washington, Washington, D. C.:

I have the request that the two regiments of heavy artillery to be sent to this army may be ordered to Brandy Station, where further instructions will be given them. It is desired that the commanders of the regiments notify Brigadier-General Hunt, chief of artillery, of these headquarters, when they will probably reach Brandy Station.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, D. C., March 25, 1864.

Major-General SIGEL,

Cumberland, Md.:

The following telegram is forwarded for your information:

CULPEPER, March 25, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK:

General Sigel telegraphs to K. V. Whaley to ascertain whether Twentieth and Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry have been ordered to his department; that they properly belong to him and are ready to come, and for him to see that they receive the order. I know no reason why these two regiments should not be ordered to the Department of West Virginia, but it is time General Sigel should learn to carry on his official correspondence through the proper channels and not though members of Congress. Please call his attention to the fact that improper official correspondence will not be tolerated in future.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
