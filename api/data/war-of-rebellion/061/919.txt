situated about a mile apart, I was instructed by you to divide the force and attack both simultaneously at daybreak. As the horses could not be taken down the mountain within danger of alarming the Indians, the cavalry detachment was ordered to remain on the mountain.

At 12.30 a. m. on the 29th, Lieutenant Burkett was ordered to proceed to the upper racheria and attack it at daybreak. Fort the detail of the attack upon the upper rancheria, I respectfully refer you to the accompanying report* of Lieutenant burkett. At the same time I moved down the mountain upon another trail, with 32 men of Company K and 5 men of C, to attack the lower rancheria. After passing down the mountain for half a mile I halted my command and sent my scouts forward reconnoiter. I remained in this position until nearly daybreak, and then proceeded down the mountain and got position under cover of some brush within 200 yards of their huts. A fire was burning near one of them and an Indiana sitting near it. I sent Sergeant Brown, of Company K, with 15 men to enter the canon below and cut off their retreat down the canon, hoping if they escaped so to force them upon Lieutenant Burkett's command. I now advanced with the balance of my command through a corn-field to within 50 yards of their huts without being discovered and opened fire upon them. These huts were situated on a mesa some 30 or 40 feet above the creek, and I now discovered that the main portion of the rancheria was along the creek in the bottom of the canon. The inmates of the lower huts had commenced a precipitate retreat down the canon, seeing which, Sergeant Brown took his party forward on a run, met them with a volley, killed some and turned the rest back up the canon and up the steep open mountain on the opposite side, thus exposing them to the fire of my whole force. Not more than 7 Indians escaped, and 4 of these, from the blood on their trails, were known to be wounded. The only one who escaped down the canon was afterward trailed by his blood for half a mile and killed. He can an ivory-handled Colt revolver with the name of John B. mills, jr., engraved upon the handle. He was recognized by the Indian woman as a leading chief named Ska-ish-nah, and said to be known to the Mexicans and Americans by the name of Skid-na-ha. In twenty minutes from the commencement of the action not a line Indian was to be seen. The result was 36 killed, 4 wounded, and 2 prisoners, and no casualty or our side. We captured $660 in gold coin, 1 Sharps carbine, 1 Colt revolver, 1 double-barreled shotgun, 1 fine California saddle, 1 pair saddlebags, 1 bridle, 1 headstall, 1 small box musket caps, 1 box pistol caps, 2 powder-horns containing a little power, about 1,000 pounds mescal, and several baskets of wheat. The caps were distributed among the meant. A porting of the mescal was retaining to rations our prisoners to Tuscon, and the balance, with a large a lumber of bows and arrows and a great quantity of trans, valuable only to the Indians, was placed upon the huts and burned. Lieutenant Dutton with the train arrived at 9 a. m., and Lieutenant Burkett and command at 11 a. m. The whole force was encamped on the edge of the corn and wheat fields, and all the animals turned upon the corps. In the afternoon Lieutenant Dutton with a small party destroyed several access of corn, beans, melons &amp;c., about a mile from our camp.

On the 30th, the command again marched, and encamped on the San Pedro, near old Fort Breckinridge, on the morning of the 1st
