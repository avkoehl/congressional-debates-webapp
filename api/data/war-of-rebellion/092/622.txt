CAPTAIN: We have marched sixteen miles to-day, and we encamped opposite Station 5 1/2. Have destroyed nine miles of railroad. My cavalry have been to near 4 1/2, and skirmished with the enemy from this point all the way, the last part very heavy. The enemy are on the other side of the Little Ogeechee River, reported to be fortifying. The are estimated at from 2,000 to 5,000 strong, and have artillery. They have burned the railroad bridge over the Little Ogeechee River. I shall have to use my pontoons there to-morrow. One of my staff and another officer who was with him in the advanced with the cavalry report to me that Captain Duncan, commanding scouts from your headquarters, and the two of his men who were shot were disgustingly drunk to-day, and that had they been sober his men would probably not have been wounded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK P. BLAIR, Jr.,
