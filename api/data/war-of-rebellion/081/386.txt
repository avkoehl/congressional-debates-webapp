HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS.

June 24, 1864-7.17 a.m.

General MEADE:

A reconnoitering party has been sent out inn my front without discovering anything. I am momentarily expecting reports from Colonel Bryan, commanding cavalry, and my division commander, who were ordered to advance their pickets at 6 a.m., and officers of day staff have now gone to get all information. This will be promptly communicated to you upon their return.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS.

June 24, 1864-7.45 a.m

General MEADE:

At last report from the cavalry which moved by Doctor Gurley's it was two miles and a half advanced without meeting enemy and must be this time have reached railroad. Nothing from the infantry reconnaissance. The change of officer on the picket-line occasioned delay beyond the hour specified for getting it forward.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 24, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

How far down the plank road is the cavalry? This road should be well watched and all roads leading from it as far as possible. Urge on Colonel Bryan the importance of feeling in every direction for the enemy. He can find out from contrabandist and others if Lee has passed on. I have a few mounted men about these headquarters which I will put on this duty.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS.

June 24, 1864-8.45 a.m.

General MEADE:

The reconnoitering party which I sent out has met small parties of the enemy beyond the picket-line of yesterday. Bryan's cavalry was ordered out on the left at 6 this morning, and I received report an hour ago that they had moved forward about two miles and a half and were still moving.

H. G. WRIGHT.

Major-General.
