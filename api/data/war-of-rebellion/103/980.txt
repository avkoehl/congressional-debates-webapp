HDQRS. CHALMERS' DIVISION, FORREST'S CAVALRY,West Point, February 14, 1865.

Brigadier General S. J. GHOLSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Aberdeen, Miss.:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Forrest to say to you that he is reorganizing all the cavalry of this district in accordance with the law recently enacted by Congress, and that the regiments of your brigade will necessarily be consolidated and placed in some other brigade. He desires me to say that he has a high appreciation of your gallantry and capacity as a soldier and officer, and that if you should ever again be fit for active field duty, which he thinks highly improbable, he will endeavor to give you a suitable command. He also directs me to state that a letter has been received from the Secretary of War stating that they have no authenticated transfer of your brigade to the Confederate service, and consequently nothing could be done for the brigade until this transfer is properly made out.

I am, sir very respectfully, yours, &c.

J. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
