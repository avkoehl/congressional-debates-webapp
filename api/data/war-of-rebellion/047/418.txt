General S. COOPER,

Adjt. and Insp. General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: Other branches of the service are exporting cotton, for the purpose of paying for military supplies. I have, therefore, to request authority to direct my chief quartermaster to purchase and export cotton, to enable him to purchase shoes, blankets, cloth, and hardware; that is, tools for the services of this department.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

[First indorsement.]

To Quartermaster-General, for report.

QUARTERMASTER'S GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, October 21, 1863.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

All the sea transportation at the command of this bureau is now being availed of to send out cotton, and procure in return quartermaster's supplies. This is done for the benefit of all the military departments, and I see no good to result from a partial arrangements, such as is proposed. It will not increase the resources of the bureau, and will lead to conflict and confusion.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Respectfully returned to General Beauregard.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Fourth indorsement.]
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, October 29, 1863.

I did not ask to employ any part of the sea transportation at the command of the Quartermaster-General, but simply for authority to purchase and send abroad cotton on private steamers, as I could have done advantageously, I am assured; and whatsoever I may have thus effected would have been a clear gain, in addition to the means at the command of the Quartermaster's Bureau.

A considerable number of the men of this command are without shoes and blankets. I hope the Quartermaster-General will either supply them himself or permit me an opportunity for supplying them.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
