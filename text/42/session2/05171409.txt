1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1409
to put it on this bill, and thereby prevent Con-
gress from acting on the matter hereafter, it
seems to me that it is perfectly idle. That is
the reason I object to it.
Mr. SHANKS. This applies solely to this
measure. It speaks of no other measure. It
does not reach out to take in any other bill. The
House will recognize that it does not take in
any other measure. While this particular meas-
ure is taken in, others are not. When the gen-
tleman from Missouri offered his amendment
he was told it did not cover the ground. I went
to the gentleman from Missouri, and we agreed
that this does cover it. Although that did not
cover it, this one does; and while that was
objected to because it did not cover the ground,
this is now objected to because it does. I will
not withdraw the measure, but hope the House
will adopt it.
Mr. SARGENT. I rise for the purpose of
offering a pro forma amendment.
Mr. HAY. I think we have reached a point
in this bill where we ought to have more dis-
cussion than we can have this evening.
Mr. SARGENT. I have the floor. I do
not object to the amendment of the gentleman
from Missouri.
Mr. SHANKS. The gentleman has already
spoken, and I believe I am entitled to the
floor.
Mr. SARGENT. I have not yielded the
floor, and I trust the gentleman will permit
me to go through. I do not say by putting
this amendment in this place we put it where
it is entirely useless or inadequate to the neces-
sities of the service, if any such necessities
exist; but it seems to be brought forward by
the gentleman as an excuse for not having
done his duty heretofore, or as a sort of com-
promise with his conscience as chairman of
the Committee on Indian Affairs. Indian
affairs seem to have run riot here for several
years past, and almost the only limitation put
upon the extravagance or misuse of appropria-
tions has been by the Committee on Appro-
priations, which committee has come in here,
and in spite of the objections raised to its meas-
ures on the ground of their being new legis-
lation, it has succeeded to a very great extent in
guarding the rights of the Indians. If the
gentleman has any proposition which ought to
come from the Committee on Indian Affairs,
let it be submitted in proper shape, and it will
have, no doubt, proper consideration. But,
sir, this is not the place for any such-matter
as that which he has now presented.
Mr. SHANKS. What objection is there to
it? Why should it not come in here as well
as in any other place?
Mr. SARGENT. It is of no more use here
than a jewel in a hog's snout. The gentleman
seems to have become suddenly sensitive in
reference to his duty.
Mr. SHANKS. I will tell the gentleman
why I became sensitive about it. The gentle-
man remarked in my hearing that it was ped-
dling out our propositions.
Mr. SARGENT. I confess I made that
remark, and I consider it just.
Mr. HAY. I move that the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose, and Mr.
Dawes having resumed the chair as Speaker
pro tempore, Mr. Stevenson reported that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had, according to order, had the Union
under consideration, and particularly a bill
(H. R. No. 1654) making appropriations to
supply deficiencies in the appropriations for
the service of the Government for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1872, and for former
years, and for other purposes, and had come
to no resolution thereon.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I move that the
House now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at four o'clock and thirty-three minutes p. m.)
the House adjourned.
42d Cong. 2d Sess.â€”No. 89.
