HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., May 20, 1865-6 p. m. (Received 11.30 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your telegram directing me to hold the Fourth Corps subject to the orders of Major-General Sheridan was received this a. m. I have no other troops which can be spared from this department. I have no mounted engineer troops, but a regiment of pioneers belonging to the Third Division of the Fourth Corps. The cavalry ordered back from General Wilson could be held subject to General Sheridan's orders, but in a subsequent telegram you have directed that it be distributed through Kentucky.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I learn by telegraph from Resaca that General Wilson has sent Jeff. Davis by way of Savannah to Washington . He first dispatched me that he was ordered, from Washington I suppose, to send him direct. On the 14th, upon receiving his dispatch, I telegraphed to you for orders as to how he should be forwarded, but received no answer. On the 15th I made preparations to send the prisoner by steamer under a strong guard to Parkersburg, W. Va., and thence in a special train too Washington, and telegraphed to what preparations I had made, and asked if they were approved. I have received no answer to that telegram. I am consequently led to the conclusion that General Wilson is considered no longer under my orders. I would be glad to know if my conjectures are correct.

I think there is no longer a military necessity for keeping up the gunboats on the Upper Tennessee River.
