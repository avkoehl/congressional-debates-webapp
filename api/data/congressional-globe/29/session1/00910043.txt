THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
43
Mr. BRODHEAD insisted on the regular order
of business.
And the SPEAKER resumed the call of the
States in their order, commencing where it was
yesterday suspended.
TEXAS.
Mr. ADAMS presented a remonstrance, similar
to those preceding, remonstrating against the ad-
mission of Texas as a slave State; remarking that
he had many more remonstrances of this nature to
present, and that he supposed the Committee on
Territories had concluded their deliberations on the
subject in the production of the report referred to.
He now repeated the motion he had previously
made, to refer this memorial, together with the
others previously presented, to a select committee,
to be composed of one member from each State in
the Union.
Mr. BOYD moved to lay the remonstrance 011
the table. Agreed to.
Mr. ADAMS, still retaining the floor, remarked
that, from the proceedings of the House upon these
memorials, of which he had presented a number,
and of which he, as well as other gentlemen, had
numbers more to present, he inferred that it was
not intended that these remonstrances should be
heard ; that it was intended to have this measure
carried through without any reference or respect to
the remonstrances against it. He had, therefore,
to submit to what appeared to be the decision, or
the intention of the House, and had nothing more
to do than to present these memorials as they had
been forwarded to him, and leave the House to
decide upon them as-they thought proper.
Mr. ADAMS thereupon proceeded to present
his large file of petitions, in accordance with the
notice lie had given.
The SPEAKER said lie would respectfully stale
to the House that, inasmuch as the House had
once determined to lay memorials of this descrip-
tion on the table, the Chair would order the. Clerk
so to dispose of them, unless otherwise ordered.
[Cries of "Agreed; agreed."]
No motion being made, the petitions were dis-
posed of as intimated by (he Speaker.
Mr. J. ROCKWELL presented a number of
remonstrances of similar character, from citizens
of Massachusetts, against the admission of Texas
into the Union as a slave State.
In presenting these remonstrances, Mr. R. wished
to be allowed to make a single remark on the gen-
eral subject, personal to himself, in regard to his
situation as a member of one of the committees of
this House, (the Committee on Territories.) The
resolution reported yesterday by the chairman of
the Committee on Territories, [Mr. Douglass,]
was reported as coming generally from that com-
mittee, not noticing the minority; and he believed
it so appeared on the Journal. I wish to state
(said Mr. R.) that I was in the minority of that
committee; that I did not agree to that report, but
objected to and voted against it; and, also, against
the proposition to make it the, special order of the
day for Tuesday next; and 1 intended to have pro-
posed an amendment to that motion, that it be re-
ferred to the Committee of the Whole 011 the state
of the anion, for the purpose of giving greater
opportunity for amendment and discussion. The
course of proceeding yesterday prevented my of-
fering that amendment; and although T have 110
idea of any unfairness 011 the part of the Chair, I
am happy to take this opportunity of making this
statement, which would have been made yester-
day, had it not been prevented under the decision
of the Chair.
Mr. R., in conclusion, moved that these remon-
strances be made the special order of the day for
Tuesday nest, to come up with the resolutions
referred to, which had been set apart for that
day.
Mr. GRAHAM rose and inquired if it would
be in order to move to lay the petition on the
table.
The SPEAKER, It would be in order.
Mr. GRAHAM. I make that motion.
The question being then taken, the motion
was agreed to, and the petitions were laid on the
table.
