The following dispatch by messenger was received late last night:
HEADQUARTERS INDIAN BRIGADE,Fort Gibson, April 22.

Colonel BLAIR,

Commanding.

SIR: Colonel William Penn Adair fled in the night cross Riover, which was rising fast; it is past fording. He thinks of going toward Bentonville and Newtonia. The streams here rising fast. I concentrated all I could spare and by night marches sent my infantry after Quantrill, crossed Verdigris last night and crossed Arkansas River 30 miles above. My scouts followed his trail going southeast. In have a good force south of the river that meet him. The line is again clear. Quantrill's design was to enter Kansas. We are suffering for the want of the supply train.

WILLIAM A. PHILLIPS,

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel, Commanding First Brigade.

FORT SCOTT, April 27, 1864.

Genera; McKEAN:

I don't think Quantrill intended to strike Kansas at all. it looks to me as if he proposed having the Santa Fe road, west of the settlement, and robbing the outgoing and incoming trains. If this be so will strike again and cross further west. It may be well to see if any protection can be afforded to such trains.

CHARLES W. BLAIR,

Colonel, Commanding First Brigade.
