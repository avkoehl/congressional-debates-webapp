too, and her income annually would, in conse-
quence, be increased by the addition of f 100,000,
while that of Fairlax would be diminished <by the
like sum, thus raising that ot the former to
#400,000 annually.and reducing (he latter f 200,000,
making its income double the other, instead ot be-
ing only equal. Thus far is c'ear, and is it not
also obvious that just as the taxes ar? increased,
just in the same proportion would Loudon „ain
and Fauiax lose, and that the latter, by increasing
taxes, only, however, equally ¡aid, might be utterly
impoverished, simply by unequal disbursements,
just as much so as by unequal taxes'2 Thu* far
inere can be no doubt.
The case would not be varied, if the supposed
Republic consisted of twenty counties, or only ere
The only difference would be, that as you enlarged
the extent, the inequality would tend more in a ge-
ographical direction, and as >ou contracted it,
between classes, particularly between capital
and labor, but each would finally end in a mo-
neyed oligarchy if not checked Indeed, it would
the more rapidly reach that termination, if left to
itself, in an extended country, than a small one, bv
concentrating the disbursements collected from all
over a great extent ot country in cms part, and to
the small portion of its citizens to whom the pro
ceeds o( the taxes would go in ihe first instance
But to return to the ca«e supposed. Ii to
unequal disbursements, there should be add
ed unequal taxation—if Fairfax should pay
twice as much in taxes as Loudon, and
the whole be expended m the latter; and
if to this unequal taxation and disbursement, in favor
of Loudon, she should add the advantages of the
paper system, and a powerful Bank,based on public
stock, that is a mortgage on the industry and | ro-
perty of the people, possessing the extraordinary pri-
vileges of having the use of the public revenue,
and its notes received in the public dues, accompa-
nied by the other measures proposed in this report,
would not the e combined, centralize a powei
there which would not only control Loudon, but,
through it, Fairfax too? And must not the «ame
causes, when applied on a large cile, to the Unun
itselt, lead to the same resulis?
Such being the necessary tendency of the fiscal
action of the Gjverrment, all real patriots—en-
lightened lovers of liberty—have ever been cau-
tious in imposing taxes, and watchful in their dis-
bursements The) never lay ihem but for ir dis-
pensable objec.s, and then not if ihey can be avoid

tures, or strict economy ¡n the collection «-nil dis-

report, and where doeo it pUce its author and the
party with whico he act«, and who have been so
loud in its support? Instead of caution, has he
not shown ihe greatest solicitude to maki> out a
necessity for imposing taxes where it does no' ex-
ist? Has he shown, or attempted to show, that his
supposed deficit m the revenue m*y rot b' met bv
the retrenchment of u eles expenditures, or eco

nue? Has he even allnoed to i&c-e monroes, ex-
cept in a single, vagse, general, and unmeaning
expression? Can h , or his piny, say th.it there

they turn round and confess that the char ^ ni
extravagant and wast ful txpend tares against be
late Administrauon anl its predecessor are ill
fa'se, and made for elect oi e>nng purpo^e^ Do
they intend io vio'a e the sclemn and oft-repeated
pledges of reform, with as little compunción as
ihe pledge to proscribe proscription? is that too
to furnish additional proof that we, in our infancy,
have sunk to so degenerate a s a e tb t candilatrs
may give the most «,olen,n p edg s before election,
and violate them witnout a blush, and with perftct
impunity, af.er frey h«ve attai <ed power?
* I fear that such w 11 prove to be the fact, ard
that as much as reform and economy are really
needed and deeply and solemnly as the part) is
pledged to carry it out, we are to hear no more
about it.   Indeed, a talented and influential mem-
ber of the party, [Mr Evans,] openly told us in
debate the other day, not only that there was no
room for reduction of expenses, but spoke with
something of scorn of retrenchment and economy
He told us, on the same Occasion, lhat he was for
action—action—and that he detes'ed abstractions
I do not, Mr Pre>ident, wonder that th  Senator,
with his sentiments, should de est abstractions.
They stand bet-iem him and his des res He
wants debts, taxes, banks, tariff; , anddis'ribations,
and but for the hateful ¡nterposi'ion o> the Const -
tution, of justice, and of tbe njmt ol fiee c'iscu--
sion—those odious abstractions—\oold re? -h his
object without delay or i npediment The S na
tor s'ands not a one in his hatred of abstractions.
He has high examples for his strong cLshke Bo
ñaparte detesten and denounced them under the
name of ideao'ogy and Cromwell held them in as
much abhorrence as the gent'eman himself They
are, in fact, the object of de'estation to every
plunderer, and to noue more so than the highway-
man He meets an honest travellei on the road
The one armed and the othf-r unarmed What
stands between him and the purse of thi- travel If,,
but these detested abstractions—vight, jus ice, and
law 1 Would he pau'c and parley about them '
No; he, too, is for action, action, action, meaning
plunder, plunder, plunder.
But the Senator does not limit his dislike to ab-
stractions. He has a mortal aversion to the inter-
ference oi the Executive with the «-uojects submit-
ted by the Constitution to the action of Congress,
and condemns, in strong larguage, the practice
adopted bv tHe Executive of recommendirg, in ihe
annual message, the policy v hieh, in h's opinion,
out hi to he pu'sued oy Congress Do s he forget
that it h made his duty by the Constitution, not
only to give information of the state of the Union,
but lo recommend such measures as he may
deem necessary and expedient. But why
should the Senator take such dislike to what
he is pleased to call the inteifetenro of
the Executive? Do-"? he distrust the present w-
cu>nbtni? Does he feai that his infl 'erice or veto
may also stand between him and the measure he
ii  o impatient to adopt? I must say that I regard
the constitutional powers of the Executive, pro-
perly understood, with feelings very different from
the Senator According o my opinion, when th y
are reotticted within ihe litits ass gncd by the
Constitution, lh"y are highly salutary The\

central ze the business and cuir^m y ot the country at

snail not undertake to repeat the reasons I then
advanced in support of my opinion. It would be
out of place; but I avail myself of the occasion to
say, that I would not divest New York of a parti-
cle of her natural advantages, but, at the same
time, I would resist any attempt toaggrardize her,
or any other city, at the expense of the others.
Our system is built on justice and equality, and I
would be as rigid in observing it between one place
and another as between mdividuals'and individuals.

REMARKS OF MR. PAYNE,
OF ALABAMA
In the House of Mepresentatnes,  June 17,  1841—
The bilí apprnprahnz tw< my-five thop&and do!-
\a*s to the widow of President Hanson—being
under con*a ¡erp'ion m Committee of t^e Whole
Mr Chairman     Tne rour<?e which the debate
has tak^n, superadded to my determination to * ote
agaiast ih^ amendment  now,  a-d the bill hereaf-
ter, seems to  require that I shou d state the rea
son« upon which that vo*e will be given.
Tne question is not the merit" or dements of
General Harr^un—with that questiea I have no-
thing to do—neither shall I discuss it
The true question for our consideration is, have
we the constitutional power to grant the appropria-
tion, and if we have, is it expedient to do so'
This appropriation is a4ted to indemnify the
widow of General Harrison for expend.tures in-
curred in his canvass for the Presidencv. lam
ont- of thos*3 who beiieve Congress has no power
to make an appropriation for any such object.
Th- Constitution declare*- that "Congress shall
ha/e power to lay and tolled taxe , dudes, ex
ci^es, and impost*," for what purpose? "to pay
the debt* and piovide for the common defence and
general welfare of the United States," The-<e are
the only objects to which we can constitutionally
apply the public revenue. Now tm<¡ appropria
tion neither pa>s the "deb^s or provides for the
common d^nce and general welfare," and r
therefore not authorized by the Constitution.
Another gentleman claims this app opria'ion, to
dischaige a debt clui1 to General Harrison, under
an implied contract with ihe Government The
Constitution d°clar< s mat " the President «-hall at
^fatep^ times, receive for his services a compensa-
ion which sball neither be increased or diminished
during the peno i tor which he sha11 have been
í 'ected " No imp ¡ed contract can subvert thi°
clause of tbe Constuution Gen HairLon reived but one
month 1-3 Prescient of the United St.ate& to give him $25,000

Innitfitim, is to usurp to day the r°wcrs y°u may need to

think not It would be laying the foundation of a system of
