BROWNSVILLE, June 6, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I expect to leave in the morning with a scout for Arkansas and Bayou Meto bottoms. I am fully satisfied that there is quite a large force of guerrillas in that vicinity, and I know that some of Marmaduke's men are in there. Have you any directions to give or any suggestions to make?

O. WOOD,

Colonel, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 6, 1864-4.45 p.m.

Colonel W. MYERS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The purchase of cavalry horses must be conducted under the Cavalry Bureau. Colonel Ekin has gone West, to stimulate purchases if possible. In the mean time, General Steele must follow the enemy's example and take horses if necessary.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, Saint Louis, Mo., June 6, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,Pilot Knob:

Send one full company of cavalry along the railroad to take station at Meramec [and] Big River bridges, with headquarters at De Soto. Select a good company, well officered. They must exert themselves to the utmost to kill any small gangs of guerrillas prowling near the line of the road. There was a party of 5 guerrillas robbed a store at Sullivan Station last night. If the commanding officer of the company thinks it will do to subdivide it so much, he may put a squad also at Pevely and one at Mineral Point. Answer when men are sent from Pilot Knob.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT, Saint Louis, Mo., June 6, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,Pilot Knob:

Have the four companies got off from Pilot Knob yet? If yes, when? Order Major Bartlett to march to Saint James instead of to Sullivan, and to report his arrival by telegraph from Rolla, where he will draw rations and forage also, if it cannot be purchased of the neighboring farmers. He will, at that point, however, be still in my district, and will not report to General Guitar, unless there be a necessity so urgent as not to allow time to communicate with me.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
