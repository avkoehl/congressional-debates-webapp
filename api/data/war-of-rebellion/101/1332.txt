HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Washington, January 15, 1865.

Brigadier-General SHELBY,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I sent you an order yesterday, by direction of the major-general commanding, to impress what beeves you could find in the counties of Red River and Lamar, and to send them here without delay. He requests me to-day to write that 1,000 beeves are required here at once; that the line of the Ouachita, including Camden, will have to be evacuated; that his troops have been several days without beef, in consequence of the failure of the department officers (over whom he has no control) to furnish beef; that it requires about 600 beeves a week to furnish this army, and that there must be a surplus on hand of at least 1,200 beeves to enable this army to subsist in front even a week in case of an advance; that by the greatest and perhaps fated neglect of those whom he cannot control this district is on the verge of ruin, and that therefore he is compelled in order to save it, even temporarily, under the present system, to impress beef in Texas whatever may be the consequence; but that you will therefore select your most suitable officers and men and endeavor to persuade the farmers to sell, and only impress when the beeves cannot be obtained by purchase. The impressment law must be followed strictly. The major-general commanding is informed that there are many beeves in Hopkins County, Tex. You will get, therefore, 400 from each of the counties named, or apportion the number to each county, accordingly to what may be its estimated capacity to furnish. Funds will be sent you, if possible, to pay upon the spot. As soon as 150 beeves are obtained send them, and push the matter as rapidly as possible. Consult some patriotic citizens as to the beeves in the three counties named (Lamar, Red River, and Hopkins). Tell them that there is preparing a great raid from Little Rock for Northern Texas, as far as the major-general commanding can judge, and that the beeves can be returned to them, if they desire it, as soon as the officers at Shreveport can obtain them. Send your unarmed men (good herdsmen) for the beeves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. M. KIMMEL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Washington, January 15, 1865.

Major-General MAXEY,

Commanding District of Indian Territory:

GENERAL: In consequence of the threatening attitude of the enemy in front of this army, the major-general commanding has directed me to say to you that as the department commander some weeks since directed him to take command of Gano's brigade in case an emergency should arise which would require their services to repel the enemy from this district, that you will direct the commanding officer of that brigade to hold his command in readiness to move in this direction at short notice, prepared to meet the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. M. KIMMEL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
