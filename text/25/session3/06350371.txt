and God forbid that I should evei attempt to rob
him of any portion of his well earned reputation
Often has he been styled the Old Roman, upon
this floor and elsewhere I, before my God and
my country, believed that if his political advisers I
and leading fitends had possessed any portion of
his Roman firmness, the condition of my country
wojld have been far different from what it is It
is to the base truckling, the time-seivmg syco-
phancy of his fnends, that I ascribe his bold and
onward course in error, no matter what he did,
no matter what he said, it was pronounced the
best act of his life, and shouts of applause went
forth fiom this hall, which were blindly echoed
from one end of the country to the other by the
party presses of the day Yes, sir, the represent-
atives of freemen, according to their own show-
ing, would rally around him, and pat him upon |
the back, and say, " Go it, my old hero, right or
wrong" If the representatives of the American ¡
people had acted as became the representatives of
freemen, and, instead of shouting hosannas to
everything he did, had said to him, " Sir, we
respect and nonor you, but we diffei with you as
to this or that measure, and we cannot go with
you," General Jackson would not have been de-
ceived The gieat misfortune of his administra-
tion, in my opinion, was this he mistook the
selfish and interested support that was given to
his measures as the íesult of honest conviction on
the part of his frtendsas to the correctness of those
measures, when, in fact, then suppoitsprang fiom
the dread of his overtopping populanty Then,
sir, how easy was it for him to be deceived
Honest himself, thought others to be equally so
Fatal, fatal, erroi ' It has overspread his coun-
try with calamity, and but foi the fact that an
impartial historian will expose to merited scorn
the time-seivmg sycophants with which he was
surrounded, the name of Andrew Jackson would
have been handed down to posterity in a very
unfavoiable light How pleading must be the
reflection to each lover of his country, that there
are materials enough let to secure to General
Andiew Jackson the proud and elevated station
upon the page of histoi y that his name is so justly
entitled to occupy, while the names of his deceiv-
ers and flatterers will be consigned to that infamy
which they so richly deserve
Mr Chairman, it is time I should return to the
thread of my story General Andrew Jackson,
m an evil houi, determined to give the country a
bettei currency If, in the course of my remaiks
I shall be able to prove, from unquestionable doc-
uments, that the promise to better the currency,
the promise to destroy monopolies, the promise
to retrench expendituies of the Government, the
promise to cuitail presidential patronage, all sig-
nally failed, or were totally disregaided, and that
m the midst of the consternation and alarm which
attended the blow-up of these fond and favorite
schemes, the occupant of the "White House was
revolutionized in twelve days, called Congress
together, and recommended the sub-Treasury as
the last and only anchor upon which to rest a
hope that the sinking fortunes of the Adminis-
tration might be íescued, will I not have proven
that this sub-Tieasury scheme is the result of
one of those political revulsions that, in the his-
tory of human affairs, occasionally overtake a
party m their mad and daring career, and that it
is not the cool, matuie,and well digested plan of
statesmen > May I not, then, turn round and
appeal to my countrymen, and ask them, with
some point and meaning, whether they are will-
ing to receive at the hands of the miseiable stock-
jobbers in politics this sub Treasury scheme upon
tiust' I will how produce my proof, and, in
confirmation of what I have said, I will read
various passages fiom President Jackson's dif-
ferent me&sages, beginning with his first and
ending with his farewell address,
" The charter of the Bank of the United States expires
m 1836, and it? stockholders will most probabh apply (or a
renewal of tlieir privileges In order to avoid the cvilb re
suiting fiom precipitancy in i incisure involving such ím
roifnt principles and such deep pecuniary mtere-t-, I feel
th^t I einnot in justice to the pirties mteiesíed ti o soon
present it to the di líbente consideration of the I egi liture
and the peoplp Both the constitutionality and the expe
dieucyot Hielan creating this bank aie well questioned
lya Hije portion of our fellow citizen , and it must be
admitted by all that it has filled in the great end of estab
hshing a uniform and sound currency "
The Administration—Mr. Williams.
Does not this passage most clearly prove that
the declaration of war against the United States
Bank was made for the sole purpose of bettering
the condition of the currency>
Again, the President, in his second message,
says*
" The importance of the principles involved in the in
quiry, vi hetlier it will be proper to reeharter the Bank of the
United State Requires that Ishouldagain call the attention
of l>on_res  to the subiect Nothing Ins occurred to lessen
in my degree the dinners which nntiy of our citizens ippre
hend fiom that institution as it present organized Jn the
spirit of itupr ivement and compromise winch distinguishes
oui country ind its institutions, it becomes us to inquire
whether it bt not pi  ib e to secure the idvinti"Ps afioid
ed by the present bank through the agency of a Bank of the
United States, so modified in its principles and structure
as to obviate constitutional and other objections It is
thought practicable to organize such a bank, with the ne
cessary otticers, as a branch of the Treasury Department,
based on the public and individual deposits, without power
to make loans or purchase property "
Here is an acknowledgment of the importance
of a United States Bank, and a govei mental one
recommended, by the very individual who reor
ganized and disciplined the modern Democrats of
the day Wheie slept their Demociacy then?
It was surrendered at discietion Let me lead to
the House a portion of Mr McDuffie's celebrated
report, that " expunged," even from the mind of
the Piesident himself, for a time at least, if not
forever, his Treasury bantling So convincing,
so ovei whelming was this leport, that not even
one partisan newspaper editor was found un-
blushing enough to defend the Piesident's plan
of a bank
"The mind almost mstmctivelv shunks from the con
teniplation ot an idel so ominous to the purity ot the Gov
eminent and the liberties of the piople    No Government
of which the committee have anv knowledge, except, pel
haps tht  despotism of Ru sia, wis ever invested with a
patronage at once  o prodigious in us influence and so din
gerousinits character    In the most desperate financial
extremities, no other Luropoan Government his ever ven
tured upon in experiment so perilous   Í1 the whole patron
age of the English monarchy were concentrated m the hands
I ot the Ainenc m Executive, it may be well doubu d whether
I the public liberty would be so much endangered by it as it
would be by this vast pecuniary machine, which would
place in the hind  of every Administration $50,000,01)0
' as a fund to re wild political pirn an     Are there not those
who sincerely and honestly believe that public offices are
legitimate objects of political warfare, and the rightful re
ward of the victorious paity,as d sinterested and as pun
otic is the great body of every politicll pirty is idmitted to
be'   The fact is no less true than it iS lin nt ible, tint the
most devoted and active partisans are very olten mere sol
I dier  of fortune, who witch the political signs and enlist
I at the eleventh hour under the banner  of the party most
likely to be successful "
I     Comment on such an extract as this is useless,
1 and I will pass on to the Piesident's third mes-
I sage
" Entertaining the opinions heretofore expressed in rela
' tion to the United bntes Bank as at present organized, I
felt it my dutv, m my former messages frankly to disclose
them in order tint the attention ot the Legislature and the
people should be seasonably directed to that important sub
ject, and thai it might be considered ind finally di po ed of
m a manner best calculated to promote the ends of the
Constitution and subservi the public interests Hiving
thus conscientiously disclnijed a constitutional duty, I
deem it proper on this ocei ion, without a more particular
reference to the views of tin suhiect then expressed, to
leave it for the present to the investigation of an enlightened
people and their repie entali\es '
Well, Mr Chan man, let us see what the en-
lightened people's repiesentatives, to whom the
matter was releí red, did upon the sub)ect Duting
the same session of Congress at which this mes-
sage was communicated, the enlightened people's
representatives recharteied the Bank of the Urn
ted States The President, although he had left
it with the representatives, vetoed the bill The
same enlightened people's representatives, at the
same spssion, passed the following resolution
" Resolve l That the Government deposits may, in the
opinion of this House, be safely continued in the Bank of
the United Bute , '
forty-six members voting against, and one Iran
dred and nine voting for the resolution Still, on
the 18th day of September following, General
Jackson "takes the responsibility," and removes
the public deposits fiom the Bank of ihe United
States, and places them in State banks' The
same Congress, assembled m December aftei-
waids, ratified and approved of the acts of the
Piesident' Had I not, then, some authority for
the assertion that General Jackson could wheel
this House to the right or left with the same ease
that you could turn that door upon its hinges
Ho. of Reps.
The war of extermination was now at its highest
pitch The political existence of the Administra-
tion seemed to be shivering in the wind, all was
doubt and uncertainty The people at last sus-
tained the Administiation, relyingupon the pi oti-
lses of the paity that they would give them a bet-
ter currency, and manage the fiscal opeiations of
the Government better through the agency of the
State banks than had been done by the United
States Bank In the sixth annual message we
find the following tnumphant announcement
" Happily, it is already illustrated thatthe agency of such
an institution ia not necessary to the fiscal operations of the
Government 1 he State banks are found fully adequate to
the performance of all the services which were required o*"
the Bank of the United States, quite as promptly and with
the same cheapness They have maintained themselves,
and di charged ill these duties, while the Bank of the Uni
ted States was still powertul, and in the field as an open
enemy "
Then, sir, are you surprised that the people
suppoi ted the State bank system under such a
shower of promises, and the announcement of
such happy success > It is true, it all turned out
to bea mistake Still it was, fora time, believed,
Gencial Jackson, in his seventh annual message,
foi the fiist time denounces monopolies as a sys-
tem at war with the genius of all our institutions
There is connected with this part of ins message
a remaikable fact, which I wish to state, and per-
mit every man to draw his own conclusions It
was announced m Niles's Register, November 7,
that the State of Pennsylvania would charter the
United States Bank The message, in which
banks and monopolies arc denounced, is dated
the 3d day of December following To say the
least of it, is it not strange that the idea of mo-
nopolies being dangeious to liberty did not occur
to the mind of the Piesident until thatlate period'
and that, too, not until there were premonitory
symptoms that the monster with whom he had
been waging a seven years' war was about to live
in a new shape' Where slept the zealous and
watchful guardians of liberty, when other State
banks were spi ingmg up ground them like mush
rooms, the growth of a night, until then numbers
had increased from little over three hundied to
over seven hundied? While this gallant band ot
Democrats, Don Quixote like, was charging home
upon the monster with only a capital of thirty-
five millions, little monsters to the number of four
hundred, with a. capital of two hundred and fifty
or three hundred millions, made then appearance,
which produced a bloated and unhealthy pros-
penty, (as pointed out by the Opposition before
it happened ) Still it was seized upon and
proudly pointed to as evidence of their wise ad-
ministiation But I will proceed with my ex-
tiacts General Jackson, in his farewell address,
again warns the country against monopolies, and
seems to lay the flattering unction to his soul that
his humble efforts had done much towards put-
ting them down, while, in fact, then number had
moie than doubled He there uses the following
lemarkable language
" My humble efforts have not been spared during my ad
ministration of thi Govi rnmpnt to restore the constitutional
currency of gold and silver and something, I trust, h is been
done towards the accomplishment of this most desirable
object  >
The future historian will be at a loss for the
evidence on which he founded this assertion
How it is possible he could have conceived such
an idea is unaccountably strange The fact is,
the gold and silver that had been imported had
found its way to the vaults of the different State
banks, and, instead of gold and silver, we had its
representative, in the shape of State bank bills
Ihen, it is evident, the result of his efforts was
to substitute State banks and a local currency for
a United States Bank and a general currency, with
this difference, that there was in circulation double
the amount of paper money when he wrote his
farewell addiess that there was when he entered
upon the duties of his administration In addi-
tion to that, it must be apparent to all who un-
derstand the component paits of our Government,
that the only way gold and silvei can become the
circulating medium is, by amending the Consti-
tution of the United States, and taking awav the
power from the States to chartei banks rheie
never having been any such attempt, I view all
other attempts as meie humbuggéry, designed to
gull the country
