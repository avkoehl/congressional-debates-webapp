Major General S. JONES:

Recent information places the enemy between the Oconee and Ocmulgee Rivers. I confess, however, that my information is not definite of reliable. When I left Macon it was not believed that Macon would be attacked. Lieutenant - General Taylor is in command there. Give me the news in your district.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond:

Arrived last night late, and take command this morning. We learn from General Wayne, who holds the Oconee railroad bridge, that the enemy has not crossed the river in any force. He has concentrated at Milledgeville, and seems to be tending south. Our cavalry, under Wheeler, is in his front, and has been ordered to destroy every vestige of subsistence and forage as it retires, to hang upon his flanks, and retard his progress by every possible meant. I am informed the brigades from Southwest Virginia have joined Wheeler. President's dispatch of 23rd just received.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

The enemy has crossed the Oconee; was met this evening in force at Buffalo Creek, near Sandersville. His movements from that point will determine whether he designs attacking here or on Savannah.
