Colonel C. G. HALPINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: My advance arrived within four miles of Winchester this evening. Enemy made a forward movement, but were checked by a cavalry charge. My troops occupy the Valley from Smithfield or Midway to North Mountain. Early has been moving from occupy field-works at Winchester. Jackson came through Snicker's Gap on Saturday, and turned toward Martinsburg to picket roads, in order to protect passage of trains. Sheridan reported in Loudoun Valley, south of Manassas Gap; headed off trains, and obliged them to come into Shenandoah Valley. Early was beaten at Snicker's Ferry yesterday. I cannot learn that Crook is pressing him to-day. Indications are that enemy must attack me in the morning. The probabilities are that I shall attack him. My force is necessarily very much distributed to clear out the Valley, but I rely upon some co-operation eastward. The casualties on both sides are few, as Jackson did not wait to be hurt.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
