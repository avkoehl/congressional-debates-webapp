Numbers 364. Report of Captain R. C. Wilson, Fourteenth Tennessee Infantry.

MAY 10, 1863.

SIR: The Fourteenth Tennessee Regiment was led into the battle of Chancellorsville by Colonel William McComb, who was wounded Sunday morning, after which I took command. So far as I know, the men and officers behaved very well.

On Tuesday, after I had taken command, we were ordered out on picket to relieve the First Tennessee, which we did about sunrise, and remained on the same ground until ordered to move forward, which we did. We moved forward 75 to 100 yards, connecting the right wing of the regiment with the pickets on our right, and disconnecting with the pickets on our left, but, finding the enemy's pickets on our left in too strong a force, our left was forced to fall back, so as to be on a line with the pickets on our left. The prisoners who were under arrest in the regiment took guns, and two of them went into the fight; the other one was lost sight of at the time and place we were under the artillery fire of the enemy on Friday evening. Whether he was killed or wounded, or has deserted, I am not able to say.

Respectfully,

R. C. WILSON,

Captain, Commanding Regiment.

General J. J. ARCHER.
