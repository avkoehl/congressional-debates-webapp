THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May M,
for delivering the feed-water is suoh that the boil-
ers cannot be injured thereby â€¢ and that such boil-
ers, and the machinery and the appurtenances, may
be safely employed m the service proposed iu the
written application without peril to life; and shall
also satisfy themselves that the safety-valves are of
suitable dimensions, sufficient in number, and well
arranged, one of which may, if necessary, in tlio
opinion of the supervising or local inspectors to
secure safety, be taken wholly from the control of
all persons ensraged in navigating any tuch vessel,
and bo secured by the inspectors; and that the
weights of the safety-valves aro properly adjusted
so as to relieve tbe boiler tit the pressure prescribed
by the inspector's certificate; that there is a suffi-
cient number of frause-coeks properly insorted;
and, to indicate the pressure of steam, reliable and
approved steam-gauges, oneot which is to be placed
in each firc-room and ono in the engine-room, and
which shall at all times be subject to the inspection
of passengers \ and reliable water-gauges and a
suitable steam-whistle; and that fusible metals aro
properly inserted, except on sea-going steamers,so
as to fuse by the heat of the furnace whon the water
in the boilers shall fall below its prescribed limits;
and that adequate and certain provision is made for
an ample supply of water to feed the boilers at all
time-*, whether such vessel is in motion or not, so
that in all boilers tbe water shall not be less than
three inches above the top of the flues; and also
that means of blowing out are provided, so as to, so
iaras practicable, thoroughly remove the mud and
sediment from all parts of the boilers when they
arc under pressure of steam: Provided, however,
That no kind ot instrument, machine, or equipment
for the better security of life, provided for by this
act, shall bo used on any vessel carrying passengers
which, shall not bo approved by the board of super-
vising inspectors, and also by the Secretary of the
Treasury.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out the
third clause of the eleventh section in the
following words:
Thirdly. That in subjecting boilers to the hydro-
static te-its, inspectors shall rate the working power
of all boilers, whether old or new, according to their
strength ; and in all cases the test applied shall ex-
ceed the working allowed in the ratio of ono hun-
dred pounds pressure per squaro inch to seventy-
five pounds per square inch; or tho allowed steam
pressure be three iourihs the number of pounds to
tho square inch on vessels carrying passengers, and
four tilths 011 all other boats, to which tho boilers
shall have been subjected by tho hydrostatic test
and found sufiieient therefor; but should such in-
spectors bo of theopinion that said boiler, by reason
of its construction or material, will not safely allow
so high a working pressure, they may, for reasons to
be stated specially in their certificate, fix thework-
ing pressure of said boiler at less than three fourths
of said teat pressure; and ali boilers used 011 steam
vessels carrying passengers, and constructed of iron
or steel plates, inspected under the provisions of this
act, shall be^ubjicted to a hydrostatic test in the
ratio of one hundred pounds to tho square inch to
seventy-five pounds to the square inch of the work-
ing steam power allowed; and no boiler or pipe, 01*
any ol'the connections therewith, shall be approved
which is made, in whole or in part, of bad material,
or is unsafe in its form, or dangerous from defectivo
workmanship, age, use, or other cause.
And to insert in lieu thereof:
Thirdly. That in subjecting to the hydrostatic
tests boilers called and usually known under the
designation of high-pressure boilers, the inspector
shall assume one hundred and ten pounds to the
square inch as the maximum pressure allowable as
a working power for a new boiler forty-two inches
in diameter, made in the best manner, of inspected
iron plates, one fourth of an inch thick, and of a
quality required by law, and shall rate the working
power of all high-pressure boilers, whether old or
new, according to their strength, compared with
this standard, and in all cases the test applied shall
exceed the working power allowed in tne ratio of
one hundred and sixty-live to one hundred and ten;
and in subjecting to the test aforesaid that class
of boilers usually designated and known as low-
pressure boilers, the said inspectors shall allow as a
working power of each new boiler a pressure of only
three iourths tho number of pounds to the square
inch to which it shall have been subjected by the
hydrostatic test, and found to be sufficient therefor;
but should such inspectors be of the opinion that
said boiler, byreason of itsconstruction or material,
will not safely allow so high a working pressure,
they may, for reasons to bo stated specially in their
certificate, fix the working pressure of said boiler at
le?>s than three fourths ot said test pressure ; but all
boilers used on steam vessels, and constructed of
iron or steel plates, inspected under the provisions
of section thirty-six of this act, shall be subjected to
a hydrostatic test, in the ratio of one hundred and
fifty pounds to the square inch to one hundred
pounds to the square inch of the working steam
power allowed; and no boiler or pipe, or any of the
connections therewith, shall be approved which is
made, in whole or in part, of bad material, or is un-
safe in its form, or dangerous from defective work-
manship, age, use, 01* other cause.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in the fourth Ql&use
of section eleven, line one hundred and sixty-
eight, to strike out the word " approval" and
insert " disapprovalso as to read:
Fourthly. When the inspection is completed and

throughout, they shall make and subscribe a certifi-
cate to the collector or other chief officer of tho cus-
toms of the district in which such inspection is made,
in accordance with such form aaid regulations as tho
board ofsupervisinginspeetovsshall prescribe, which
certificate shall be verified bv the oaths of the in-
spectors signing it before tho chief officer of tho cus-
toms of tho district, or any other person compotent
by law to administer oaths; and in case the said
inspectors refuse to grant a certificate of approval, ;
they shall state in writing, signing tho same, thoir |
reason for such disapproval.
The amendment was agreed to.

in anysuit, action, or proceeding, it shall be claimed
tbatupon any vessel there has been any nun-com-
pliance with any provision of this act, as to any
matter last aforosaid, while a certificate of inspec-
tion of such vessel was in force, if tho owner or own-
ers, or any officers of such vessel, shall show that, as
to the matter or matters complained of, tho vessel
remained substantially in tho same condition as
when the certificate was granted, such non-compli-
ance shall not be deemed unseaworthiness or evi-
