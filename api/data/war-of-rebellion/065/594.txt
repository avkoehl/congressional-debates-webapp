General J. F. GILMER,Commanding, &amp;c., Savannah:

GENERAL: I have only one 42-pounder, banded and rifled, disposable; shall it be sent to Savannah or Red Bluff?

Look to the best method of preventing the enemy from occupying Elba Island, for the purpose of shelling Savannah, if practicable, from there.

When at Fort McAllister last I ordered a small rifled "wall piece" to be sent here for use in Sumter; if it has not been done renew the order at once and have it sent to Colonel Waddy.

Has Commander Hunter reported had its whether he could transfer to you the Brooke 6.40 gun which had its muzzle shot off? As soon as you get the gun have it properly cut off and banded. I will send you from here a bed for it. This gun is intended to be used, as you are already informed, against the enemy's naval depot, shops, &c., in Scull Creek near Hilton Head.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

The enemy hold Baldwin and Sanderson and the telegraphic operators and their instruments. Wanted re-enforcements both in East and West Florida. At least 5,000 additional troops are necessary to prevent the destruction of all public as well as private property, and to save Florida. Without prompt help will be lost.
