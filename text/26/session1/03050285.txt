The SPEAKER then announced the business before the
House ts be ihe amendment of the gentleman from Louisiana
[Mr GarlaKd] to the motion to print the report of the commit-
tee on the New Jersey elections—the amendment being to (lis
charge the committee from the farther consideration ol certain
testimony
Mr BUTTS, who was entitled to the floor, resumed, in con-
tinuation, his remarks, where he left off on Saturday morning,
and continued speaking unul the expiration of the morning
hoar, when
The Senate bills on the Spbaksr's table were then taken up,
read twice, and commuted, after which,
On motion q/ Mr JONES of Virginia,
The House went into Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, Mr DAWSON in the Chair—and resumed the
consideration of the Treasury note bill
Mr. TRUMBULL, who was entitled to the floor, said he wa
as anxious te supply the Government with funds as any other
person, but he objected to the ground assumed as a cause for
the issue It was asked ouly for a temporary purpose—to pay
out in anticipation of receipts from revenues during the year
Such had been the excuse for former issues, and such would
be the pretext for the future He took exception, because he
believed there was a permanent deficit He objected to ihe bill
in its present foim, because he believed it would empower the
Secretary to issue from ten to sixty millions in the year, if he
deemed it necessary,mstead of five millions He was understood
to be apposed to it, also, because he believed it to be connected
with another system the Sub-Treasury system He argued
«taome length, and cited the authority^ of Crawford, Dallas,
and others, to show that the issue of Treasury notes, as bills
of credit, were unconstitutional, and adverted to the Madison
papers, giving the debates of the convention which formed the
Constitution, by which he showed that the authoniy was ex-
pressly forbidden to the Government by that convention If
any such power at all existed, it was by implication He was in
favor of a loan, because the power in the Constitution wasspe
cific and express, and opposed to the issue of these notes, be-
cause it was expressly denied, if they be issued in the form of
• bill el credit. He was not in favor of a national debt, though
be did not believe it such a great uurse as some gentlemen
seemed to think The debt incurred to carry on the last war
haJ, on the other band, proved rather a blessing than other
wise, when he considered the termination of it. He was confi-
dent that the credit of the Government was such that it could
borrow any amount necessary, and pay it at ttsown option;
and contended that by thus borrowing from abroad, it would
be beneficial to the business operations of the country;
and, on the other hand, that if the issue of the notes be resorted
to, it would cripple the business—for the reason that the Go-
vernment, by its superior credit, could possess itself of the
means of the banks—would absorb all the means by which
those institutions usually afford facilities to the merchants to
carry on their operations He then went into an argument to
show that these notes were as much a currency as State bonds,
bank paper, and pest notes, and that they would tend to in-
crease all difficulties of which a portion of the country now
complained—that there was too much paper, and too little spe-
cie He believed, with the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, that the issue of notes would help the banks
These institutions, in consequence of the doubt hanging over
the credit of the trading community, would invest the funds in
these notes, and would take just so much from the
merchants If the money be borrowed on loan from
abroad, it would be beneficial both to the banks and
to the merchants The issue of these notes was a
part of ihe plan to carry out the gold and silver system—
a plan that could not be accomplished without it He bell ved it
would increase the power of the Executive over the money
syatnm of the country, which was more dangerous than the
bank money power of which there were so loud complaints
and so many apprehensions He also argued to show that,
under the operations of the Bank of the United States, the ex-
changes and currency were in much better condition than under
any other system. He contended that, under an Independent
Treasury, or a hard money system, the Government never
would have been able to pay off its national debt, or assumed
the stand it bow occupies among the nations of the earth Mr.
T having coneluded after a long argument,
Mr EVaNS obtained the floor, and was about proceeding in
his remarks on the bill, but yielded to
Mr BUCK, who said this was the day on which it was made
the special duty of the Select Committee on Printing to make
a report; and, with that view, he would move that the commit-
tee rise to enable him to make that report
The question on rising was taken hy tellers, [Messrs Hubbard
and Wbllkk acting as such,] and decided in the negative—aves
47, noes 78
Mr EVANS resumed He regretted that the subject of the
finances of the Government had excited so little attention
Since the subject of the disordered finances had been under con
«deration, the committee had with difficulty kept a quorum
He stated in advance, that if he voted for this bill at all, it would
be with great reluctance, and because of the absolute necessity
outs passage to secure the credit of the Government It had
wen said by the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
means, that this bill was merely Intended as a temporary ar
rangement, to meet the irregularities in the receipts and dís-
onamente—to anticipate at the present time the receipis of the
present year, which would be adequate to meet within that time
the wants of the Government He did not look upon ii
as a mere anticipation of means coming into the Trea-
SÜI7. n.?s™¿he ye*r' but believed there was a permanent
^h. w¿^ J¿? MUry: má, l5oueht"the "<"7 of 'he chairman
Of the Ways and Means and the Secretary of the Treasury, so to
state to the country, that a proper and permanent remedy might
be applied He then examined the fluctuations in the receipts
and expenditures of former years, to show that there was no.
thing peculiar in the cooditien of this year, m that respect,
which rendered it necessary now,any more than at that time, to
make an issue of notes to equalize the receipts and disburse
ments, except indeed the two millions of Treasury notes which
fell due on the first quarter of this year  The measure—the issue
of these notes—stood on a stranger ground than on that of imme-
diate present necessity    It could not be defended on the ground
of fluctation in the revenues—on the ground of mere anticipa
tion of the receipts    There was a higher ground—a permanent
deficiency in the revenues of the country   He then went into an
examination of the question of revenues in expectation, and ron-
tended that, by reduction in the tariff, and other causes, the reve
nueof this year would not approach any where near thct of the
last and previous years    To prove that there was a permanent
deficit in the Treasury, and that the revenues of the Govern-
ment for the last three years have not been sufficient to meet the
disbursements, he adverted to the fact that the five millions
which were authorized to be kept in the Treasury, to meet sud
den emergencies, (and which, by some ina Ivertence, was in
creased to'upwards of six millions,) the amounts falling due
from the suspended bonds of the merchants, and the sale of the
United States Bank bonds, and other sources, amounting to
twenty four millions, and not received during that time from the
revenues, had all been expended, to meet the wants of the Go-
vernment, within the past three years thus showing an expen
diture ot eight millions more in each year, for the last three
years, than was leceivedirom revenues    Prom this state of
things,   he believed  there  was  a permanent   deficit,   and
that the receipts of this year will not be sufficient to meet the
exiienditures.   Another reason which induced him to believe
that the revenue would not be as great as was anticipated by
by the Secretary, was the fact, that the packets from Liver-
pool, which usually came in full, are now arriving in New York
daily, almost empty, and instead of now bringing geods dutia
ble, they are carrying away goods, w hich the merchants had in
store, and for which there was no sale, and thus receiving
drawbacks, and causing another demand upon the Treasury
not anticipated    Mr E contended tl at a loan could be easily
effected, there was money enough, but no demand, currency
enough, but there was a stagnation of all business every thing
was falling, manufactures slopping, in fact every thing which
constituted   the    business   of    the   country    was   stagger
ing    All these causes   combined   to   cut off the revenues
of the country    He believed, however, there was a healthy
action   going on, though it   was a  severe one      The   na
tion was now exporting large'y, but all this went to pay the
debts abroad, which was certainly very desirable, but the ves
seis carrying out did not bring any thing back to contribute to-
wards the receipts from revenues    Mr E   was confident that
there was a permanent deficit in the Treasury, and thought the
Secretary of the Treasury should have made a faithful exposi-
tion of the condition of the finances, instead of concealing and
covering it up    He was of the opinion that the Secretary had
underrated, in his estimates, the probable expenditures of the
Government for the year, and cited many objects which he
deemed absolutely necessary, and which lie thought might pass
this session, not included in those estimates
Mr E without concluding, yielded the floor to
Mr UNDERWOOD, who moved that the committee rise,
Which question was taken by tellers, (Messrs Jomes of Vir-
ginia, and Davis, acting as such,) who reported that there were
ayes 60, noes 90    So the committee refused to rise.
Mr EVANS resumed, and said he was not speaking to delay
the passage of the bill, or worry the patience of the House He
then went on to show the depressed condition of the business of
the country; and said that he had lust been informed that a let-
ter had been received from New York, which gnes the amount
of duties paid on cargoes of four ships, compared with that of
last year in same vessels, showing that the dutus on the said
cargoes are but one seventh as great as last year.
Ii he believed with the chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means that ihe measure was only a temporary one, that
the relief hfre sought was only to anticipate the means tint
were to come into the Treasury within the year, he would not
hesitate to give it his support believing, as he did, that this de
ficiency was permanent, and that it would increase, and being
desirous to see some permanent provision made, he should much
prefer some other measure The honorable chairman tells the
House that there was necessity for immediate relief, that we
have not time to turn about and seek other modes of relief, and
he agreed with him He was constrained to say that he believed
this measure stands between Government and actual bank-
ruptcy nay, he believed that there were at that moment protested
drafts now in the Treasury Under these circumstances, much
as he would have preferred some ether mode of relief, he should
be reluctantly compelled to give it his vote
Mr THOMPSON of South Carolina followed in opposition to
the bill, contending that it was a violation of the Constitution of
the Government to issue Treasury notes He was understood
to be in favor of a direct loan He reviewed the policy of the
past and present Administrations in relation to the currency,
and attributed all ihe present embarrassments of the business
of the country to that cause He censured the course of the
Government in relation to the Florida war, and was in favor of
sending a much larger force there, which he believed was the
only means by which that.war could be successfully termina-
ted He also examined some of the prov isions of the Sub Trea-
sury bill, and denounced that meadure as one fraught with
many evils—as being very injurious to the best interests of the
country Mr T before concluding, yielded the floor to
Mr MONROE, who moved that the committee rise; and,
Tellerehavingbeen called foron that motion, Messrs Ram-
say and Hubbard were appointed as such, who reported
that there were—ayes 60, noes 93
So the committee refused to rise
Mr. THOMPSON then resumed, and concIuded his remarks
n opposition to the principles of the bill
Mr. NISBET then obtained the floor, and addressed the
House at some length in favor of the bill He considered the
issue of Treasury notes, as provided form the bill tobe in ef
feet the borrowing of money, and therefore constitutional But
to take sway even the semblance of bills of credit, he con
eluded by offering an amendment, as follows
"Provided, that the notes proposed to be issued in virtue of
this actshall bear interest of not less than two, nni more than
six, per rent at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury,
with the advice of the President "
Mr  BIDDLE then obtained the floor, but gave way to
Mr HABERSHAM, who offered an amendment, to come in
the second section, as follows-
"Which said notes shall be negotiable by endorsement only,
and subject to the same rulesand restriction  as inland bills of
exchange, but without liability of endorsers "
Mr BIDDLE said his position as a dissenting member of the
Committee of Ways and Means rendered it almost absolutely
necessary to say something on this bill He did not believe
there was sufficient time now to discuss any of the topics
in the measure, as fully as he could have wished, and as he
would have done if he had obtained the floor at an earlier
day The President says he wants the money He would
much rather, at the end of the year, find himself the dupe of
the President than peril the credit of the Government by in-
terposing opposition to the passage of the bill. He then com-
mented at length on the annual message of the President, with
a view to show that the possible contingencies which he said
might render it necessary to issue Treasury notes, had not oc-
curred He examined the bill in all its coustitutional bear-
ings, and referred to the proceedings of the convention which
formed the Constitution, and to the opinions ef ex President
Jackson and others, in support of his argument that the issue
of Treasury notes could only be defended as an act of extreme
emergency, on account of its dangerous tendencies He was
understood to be in favor of a direct loan, which, he said,
could be easily effected, as there was a vast deal of capital
lying idle in the city of New York, in consequence of the loss of
confidence in the community, and which was seeking for safe
investments.
'I He question was then taken on Mr Nisbet's amendment,
and decided in the negative
Mr HaUERsHaM then addressed the House in support of
his amendment He said he was induced to offer it, because it
had been stated by the chairman that these notes were not in-
tended to be circulated as money If it was not so intended,
there could be certainly no objection to the amendment But
if this amendment was not admitted, and the notes were in-
tended to circulate, his colleague [Mr Nisbet,] mus'agree
with him that the bill was unconstitutional He believed these
notes were bills of credit within the meaning of the Constitution,
and they would circulate as money without the restriction in
his amendment During the late war, similar notes circulated
as money, a id depreciated about twenty five per cent like the
continental money, notwithstanding they bore interest. The
notes, as proposed to be issued, will circulate as money, and
as such came within the description denominated bills of credit.
He cited decisions of the United States courts in several in-
stances to sustain his opinion His object was to lake away the
power to circulate these notes as money, and give them the
character of prommissory notes or bills of exchange Mr H.
addressed the House at some length in support of Tus amend-
ment    After which,
Mr WARREN spoke at.considerable length, and with much
earnestness, in opposition tó the bill, opposing it both on the
grounds of expediency and constitutionality, and, in the course
of his remarks, commenting on the hub Treasury bill, the
Bank of the United Slates, the deposite banks, elc
Mr BARNARD then rose, and after some remarks on the
course the debate had taken, asked the House to indulge him,
by postponing the further consideration of the subject till to-
morrow. He wished to addiess Ihe House in favor of his
amendment, but was physically unable to proceed this evening
[Cries of question, question, were heard ] Mr B said that
gentlemen could not put him down by cries of question, ques-
tion, and he now gave them notice, if in erruptions of this kind
were persisted in, he would continue on the floor so long as he
was able to stand. Mr B then moved that the committee
rise
Tel'ers were called for, and Messrs Dromgoole and Weller
were chosen, when ihe question was taken, and the tellers re-
ported ayes 53, noes 90
Mr BARNARD, after a few remarks, again moved that the
committee rise
Tellers were called for, and Messrs Hollsman and Jambs
were chosen, who, on counting the votes passing between ihem,
reported ayes 1', noes 85, the Whig members generally, tub
atlentio, refusing to vote.
A quorum not having voted in consequence,
Mr DROMGOOLE said that he was under an impression
that there was a quoium present, and he would therefore in-
quire if it was in order to have a count ol the members who
were within the bar He maintained that the committee could
sit and wait for the arrival of a quorum, if one was not pre-
sent; but he wished the fact to be ascertained by an actual
count
The CHAIR [Mr DawsonI said, that as a quorum had not
voted, the committee must rise, and report that fact to the
House The yeas and nays could not be taken in committee,
and there was no way of ascertaining whether a quorum was
present, but by an actual count
Mr CRARYsaid the fact would be ascertained on the very
next question, and that was on a motion for the committee to rue
ana retort the want of a quoium
Mr HOFFMAN contended that in conformity with the piac-
tice of the House and with parliamentary usage, no mot on is
necessary, but that the committee must of necessity rise and re-
port the fact to the House when there is not a quorum voting.
Mr DROMGOOLE said the question resolved itself into this
whether the (act of a quorum's not voting was conclusive evi-
dence that a quorum was not present
Mr MONROE would like to know how the gentleman could
arrive at the fact that there was a quorum present but by the
votes taken •
Mr DROMGOOLE It can be ascertained by an actual
count of the members present
The CllAUt was of opinion that in the event of a quorum not
voting, the committee must rise and report the fact to the House.
This was in conformity with the former practice of the House.
Mr BAN KS observed that the rule, as laid down by the Ma-
nual, (which was adopted as the rules of ihe nouse,)to dnect
the rising of the Committee of the Whole, was, that the question
should be put on a motion that the como mee rise. Now, he
presumed that the chairman could not put the question on his
own motion, but that the question must t e put on the motion of
a member He was willing to admit that a practice had P •-
vailed lure in direct opposition to this rule, but the former
Speaker informed him that he was correct in this view■ oi tne
subiett, and that he had only given contrai y dee-aloneill  con-
formity with the practice of the House It w« ""*"' 'ÍT
tkere was a quorum present, though ihere was not a quorum
TMr*HOLLEV.AN observed that it we.¡"P^^ESE
