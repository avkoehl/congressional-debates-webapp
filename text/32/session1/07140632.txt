THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 25,
can find a foreign market for that additional quan-
tity. -That is the difficulty. Cotton must find a
market, if it is only at one cent per pound. You
♦ must put ft into the hands of the manufacturer and
take such prices as he can afford to give.
Having accounted for the increased amount of
exportation since 1846, by the ftsct that ISO,000
■bales of cotton, formerly manufactured here, were
sent abroad, I proceed to show that, the ammmt
of exportation of articles of agricultural produce,-
other than cotton, have been greatly and uniformly
diminished by the tariff of 1846, and increased by
that of 1842.
The tariff of 1842 did not, to any extent, get
into operation before 1843, nor was its career
materially broken off before 1847. The capital in-
vested was riot withdrawn to any considerable
extent until about the latter period. But in order
to be fair, I have put the year 1847—the year of
the famine—into each period, making the first
period run from 1842 to 1847 inclusive, and the
latter from 1847 to 1851 inclusive. Here is the
table:
Value of breadstuffs and provisions exported annually
from 3843 to 1851, inclusive—omitting fractions.
In 1843 $11,000,000
In 1844  16,000,000
In 1845  17,000,00Cf
In 1846  27,000,000
In, 1847 :  68,000,000
• In 1848  37,000,000
In 1849  38,000,000
In 1850  26,000,000
In 1851  21,000,000
Now here is a regular flight of steps. You
have to go up one set and come down the other.
It is as plain as argument can make it. It is like
a swell in music. And yet the gentleman from
Massachusetts argues to Missouri farmers that
the quantity of exports of agricultural production
has increased under the tariff of 1840, and dimin-
ished under the tariff of 1842. As 1 remarked, I
am bound charitably to conclude that lie has not
looked over these tables. Commencing with 1843,
the swell increases regularly till 1847, and then
diminishes down to the present time, thus: 08, 37,
38, 26,21. At 1851 you are almost brought back
again to the original eleven millions from which
you set out in 1843. If gentlemen do not believe
that the tariff of 1842 increased the quantity of
exports, here are the figures, and they may ex-
amine them for themselves.
But here is another table: This gives the entire
amount of exports, including cotton, and also the
entire amount of imports; showing, also, the
amount of specie exported, and the balance against
us, from 1843 to 1847, inclusive, omittingfractions.
These items the gentleman from Massachusetts |
has wholly omitted. This table shows that the
exports from 1843 to 1847 were:
Domestic produce §529,000,000
Specie  28,000,000
Reexported  32,000,000
Making in all $589,000,000
Total imports  558,000,000
Balance, for us  $31,000,000
Showing a balance of $31,000,000 in our favor,
with an exportation of specie to only $28,000,000;
so that we might have kept our specie at home, and
still been creditors to the amount o.f $3,000,000.
That is from the period from 1843 to 1847, in-
clusive. How is it with the period covered by
the present tariff, from 1S47 to 1851, inclusive?
It is as follows:
Total imports and exports from 1847 to 1351, in-
clusive, omitting fractions. |
Exports.—Specie.. $61,000,000 j
Domestic produce... 724,000,000
Reexported  41,000,000
Total exports $826,000,000
iot.ii imports for the same
Penod $851,000,000
Balance, against us $25,000,000
This balance against us, added to the $61,000,000
of specie exported, makes a total balance against
us, from 1847 to 1851, inclusive, of $86,000,000.
In the other case, from 1843 to 1847, inclusive
the same balance was §3,000,000 in our favor'
Here is a difference of $89,000,000 m the way of
debtor and creditor.
But let me call the attention of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Rantoul,] and of the
House, to one other table, and that is the one
which shows the effects of the two tariffs upon the
iron interest.
The importations of iron from 1843 to 1851,
inclusive,.ommkrg fractions, was as follows:
In 1844   89,000 tons.
In 1845  96,000
In 1846  69,000 "
In 1847  60,000 "
In 1848 153,000 "
In 1849 289,000 "
In 1850 337,000 "
In 1851 341,000 "
I have not. the amount for the year 1843, but I
believe it is larger than that of the succeeding
year.
Here is another musical swell—steps up, up,
and then down again; and yet the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Rantoul] advances an argu-
ment designed to prove—if it was designed to prove
anything—that the importation^ iron has been di-
minished by free trade, and increased by a protect-
ive tariff. By this table, you will perceive the ex-
ports of iron, from '43 to '47 inclusive, runs down
from 89,000 tons to 60,000 tons, and that from '48
to '51 inclusive, they run up from 153,000 to 341,000
tons. That is the importation of iron alone.
The gentleman from Massachusetts says, that
in 1840 we manufactured only 295,000 bales of
cotton, and that in 1850 we manufactured 641,000
bales. For what purpose is that comparison made ?
Why, to prove that the tariff of 1846 has increased
the amount of the manufacture of domestic cotton.
Does the gentleman believe that proposition? Can
he believe it? The tables will show him, as I have
said, that the domestic manufacture of cotton has
fallen off 160,000 bales since 1846. Let him com-
pare the years 1846 and 1851, and he will see that
there is that difference in favor of the former year.
He says, that the domestic manufacture of cotton
has quadrupled within the last twenty years. Sup-
pose it has, what has effected the result? The
tariffs of 1828, 1832, and 1842. No thanks, for
that result, to the tariff of 1846. Its work has
been all in the opposite direction.
The same may be said of iron, the domestic man-
ufacture of which, says the gentleman, has in the
last twenty years, increased from 165,000 tons to
627,000 tons. That, is the work of our protective
tariffs of 1828, 1832, and 1842. The effect of the
tariff of 1846 on iron, is shown by the tables. It
increased the importation from 60,000 tons in
1846, to 341,000 tons in 1851. How can the gen-
tleman, then, take any credit to the tariff of 1846,
from the increase of the domestic manufacture of
iron during the last twenty years? None is due
to it. Had we been under its blighting influences
during the whole period, that branch of business
would have languished and died out, and Eng-
land would now be furnishing us all our iron; and
such will be the result, should that tariff be suf-
fered to continue for twenty years to come.
But in the midst of the gentleman's free trade
argument, he says, among other things, "take off
your restrictions and limitations, and let the raw
materials come in free." Why, Mr. Speaker, that
is a tariff argument, and not a free trade argument.
What is that but a restriction and limitation on
commerce. It is nothing else, unless you propose
to let everything come in free, and to raise your
revenue by direct taxation. I, too, say, let the
raw material come in free, or, at least, with dis-
criminations m favor of its importation. That is
one of the two leading principles of a protective
tariff; low duties on raw materials, and higher
duties on the manufactured article. Both look to
the encouragement of the domestic manufacture, j
The gentleman favors one, but opposes the other.
The gentleman's leading idea seems to be to
open up loads to the West, as a " means" to pre-
vent the springing up of manufactures in the Wat.
His means are g'ood, but his end is, in my opin-
ion, bad. Has it ever occurred to the gentleman
that here is another high protective tariff doctrine
of his? Means Xo keep down, or break down,
manufacturing in the West, for the benefit of
t( manufacturers" on the 4' Eastern slope!" That
doctrine from a free trade man! What means?
Why, to cheapen and facilitate the transportation.
That is the same, in effect, as it would be to re-
move the duties on foreign importations, and give
to them a cheap and free transit. A tariff of thirty
percent, is an obstruction between INT ew York and
London. The hills and rocks and rivers are the
obstructions between Lowell and Missouri. It
has been the business of England to "use these
means to prevent the establishment of manufac-
tories on our " Eastern slope," for many years.
It has been ours to counteract them. The strug-
gle has continue4 during the whole period of
our existence as a nation. 1 am afraid we are
about to pull down the barriers, and give up the
contest. If we do, the gentleman's own logie
shows that we will be to England what he wishes
to make Missouri to his manufactories t>n the
" Eastern slope"—hewers of wood and drawers of
water—and that, too, without any wood to hew,
or water to draw. The East will then be mere
conduit pipes, through which to carry the agricul-
tural products of the valley of the Mississippi to
Europe. In that state of things the gentleman
thinks he sees the future giory of this country.
Mr. Speaker, my plan is the converse of al!
this. 1 desire, so far as we reasonably can, to do
our own manufacturing; to h%e within our own
resources, and keep out of debt; to husband our
means, and build our own roads with our own
money, and not with money borrowed from Eng-
land, and for which we are mortgaging the roads
as fast as made, as well as the lands through
which they pass. I think, Mr. Speaker,that bank-
ruptcy will be the future of this country, if we
follow out his views.
But I will not follow^the gentleman further.
This is no place for a tariff speech. When a proper
occasion occurs, I may say more upon the subject,
Mr. BENNETT obtained the floor.
Mr. HUNTER. I wish to inquire whether
the amendment of my colleague [Mr. Welch]
was read yesterday simply for information, or
whether it is now under consideration?
The SPEAKER.. It was readonly for infor-
mation.
Mr. GREY. I would ask the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Bennett] to allow an amend-
ment, which 1 intend to offer at a proper time, to
be read to this House.
Mr. BENNETT. I have an amendment which
wiil consume considerable time.
Mr. GREY. I only want my amendment read.
Mr, BENNETT. Other gentlemen will desire
thesameprivilege. Mr.Speaker, beforeproceeding
with this debate, and to say what I have to say
about this bill, I desire to propose an amendment,
or rather a substitute for the bill. I move that
the bill be recommitted, or referred back to the
Committee on Public Lands, with instructions to
report as a substitute for it the bill which I send
to (lie Speaker's table.
The bill sent up to the Chair was the bill intro-
duced, with the following additional sections:
Sec. 7. Jlndhe it further enacted, That there is hereby sev-
erally granted to each State in which there are public lands,
to aid m the construction nf railroads, except that State to
which the largest amount has been granted for that purpose,
a sufficient amount of the lands ot the United States, in-
cluding the amount (if any) heretofore granted for the pur-
pose aforesaid, to each of said States respectively, to make
each of said Slates equal according to representation by the
last census, in the grants of land for railroad purposes, and
a grant of the rj^ht of way and to aid 11^ the construction
of railroads in said States respectively, to the amount afore-
said, is hereby severally made to each of said States on the
same terms, with the same reseivations.,aucl upon the tame
conditions in eveiy respect as are contained in the act en-
titled '* An act gi anting the right of way and making a giant
of hmd to the States of Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama,
m aid of the construction of a railroad from Chicago to Mo-
bile, ,J passed September 20, 1850, and all the provisions of
said act aie hereby extended and applied to the giants
heieby made to the s, iid ;>everal States, and to all railroads
in proportion to their length, made in any of said States
wholly, or in part, by means of the land granted by this
act. The amountol land to which each of said States shall
be entitled under this act, shall be detenumed in conformity
thereto by the Commissioner of Public Lands, and located
under such regulations as he mav prescribe. Each State,
so tar a-, may be, shall locate its'lands within its own lim-
its: Proiided, The lands hereby granted, shall be used to
construct or aid in constiucting railroads, and so much as
remains undisposed of for more than ten vears after it has
been located, shall revert to the United State*.
Se<\ 8. And be it further enacted, That there is heiebv
severally granted to each State in which the United Slates
have no public lands, a sufficient amount of public lands
for railroad purposes, to grant to each of t-aid State* re-
spectively, according to representation by the last census,
one half the amount giauted to the fir«t mentioned States,
foi the same purpose. The United States mail shall be at
all times transported on the raihoads made, either wholly,
or in part, by means of lauds granted by this act, under the
