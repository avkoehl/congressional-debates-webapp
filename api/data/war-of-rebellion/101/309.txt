ches, and returned in about eight days, after being robbed of everything they had. These Indians told them that they and the Kiowas and twelve other nations had made a treaty with the Texas to attack Forts Larned and Bascom, and then make a raid on the plains and so into New Mexico. Major Morrison says he met other parties of traders who had been robbed by the Indians, and to whom the same stories were told. The Texans were to leave about 1st of June. Major Morrison had in view also the release of some American women captured by the Comanches, but they had been delivered up to the Texans. My predictions are surely coming true. In ten days we will have a large party to contend with. The Fifteenth Kansas Cavalry should be pushed up; also one company with four howitzers. I have forwarded reports of Majors Morrison and Armstrong and Lieutenant Jenkins by mail to day. Colonel Leavenworth starts south to-day. He has already sent out his runners. They will meet him at the mouth of the Little Arkansas as soon as they find the Indians. Thirteenth Missouri Cavalry arrived and starts west to-morrow. Shall put the Fifteenth [Kansas] forward as soon as it arrives. Have sent two companies up to Salt Marshes. Shall move these companies to Cimarron Crossing immediately.

FORT RILEY, June 14, 1865.

(Received 8. 30 p. m. 15th.)

The coach going west from Cow Creek Station, escorted by six men and commanded by Lieutenant Jenkins, Second Colorado Cavalry, was attacked by about 100 Indians a short distance from the station. The men fought them until assistance reached them from the station. They drove the Indians to the river, killing and wounding fifteen Indians. Same day a train was attacked by about same number of Indians near Plum Butte, which was being escorted to Fort Zarah, but the escort completely routed the Indians. Our loss, two wounded. On same day near Pawnee Rock, Shrewsbury's train with corn from Leavenworth was attacked by about 110 Indians; were routed, with a loss of two of our men, who were killed, scalped, and otherwise mutilated. Two messengers for Fort Dodge were driven back to this post on the evening of the 10th, having been attacked by a party of Indians. I have forwarded reports of the above by mail.

(Received 8. 30 p. m. 15th.)

Since last report the post of Fort Dodge was attacked by about 400 Indians during a heavy fog. Loss small. The Fifteenth Kansas ought to hurry up; no report of them yet. I want another regiment of cavalry. The attack was simultaneous along the whole of my line of the Arkansas during the night of the 11th.
