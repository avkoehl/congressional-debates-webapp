or the line from Demopolis to Montgomery. I placed Brigadier General Dan. Adams in command of the District of North Alabama, and made necessary provisions for organizing and equipping the State forces which have been called out. I ordered General Liddell to take command of the district on MISSISSIPPI River below Natchez, and to make arrangements to facilitate communication with the Trans-MISSISSIPPI Department and to secure the object contemplated in that quarter. I assigned General Wirt Adams to the district on MISSISSIPPI River from Natchez as high as Grenada. I charged General Forrest with the protection of North MISSISSIPPI against the heavy force which has long been preparing to invade it from Holly Springs, placing at his command about 6,000 effective cavalry and all the State forces (about 1,500) which MISSISSIPPI has yet called out. I ordered General Roddey to take a position to re- enforce General Forrest, but, in consequence of information as to the object of Roddey's forces, contemplated by the President, have placed him again in North Alabama, whence he can operate on Sherman's rear and on raiders coming south. I have ordered General Dan. Adams to send Forrest every man he can spare, and Generals Wirt Adams and Liddell to do the same. Mobile had been stripped of troops and other military resources to re-enforce the Army of Tennessee, except on General Page 's outer line; even the heavy artillerists had been sent off when the enemy came against Fort Gaines. I returned here at once from Meridian, where my presence seemed dispensable. I have now ordered Brigadier-General Liddell to come here at once, adding his district to that of General Wirt Adams. The whole force under arms in this district is about 6,000 hastily assembled raw troops. The supplies of ordnance are insufficient, and small-arms are required immediately for the State forces still coming in. Forrest, with near 6,000 cavalry, occupies Oxford. The enemy's army, under Washburn, Grierson, and A. J. Smith, 15,000, has advanced to the Tallahatchie, with cavalry in Abbeville. Canby is besieging Fort Morgan. No tidings yet of General Taylor or his troops. I believe the attack on Mobile may not be immediate, and hope that we shall have sufficient force here when it comes. The non-combatants will not go away. Ordnance stores must be rapidly sent here. Fort Morgan can be relieved by vessels running the blockade from Havana with such stores as may be necessary. Veteran troops should be sent here as soon as they can be spared elsewhere, and they should be troops not connected by any ties with Mobile.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
