AUGUST 5, 1863 - SKIRMISH NEAR RIXEYVILLE FORD, VA.

Report of Colonel Horace B. Sargent, First Massachusetts Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST MASSACHUSETTS CAVALRY,Camp near Amissville, August 4 [7], 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that, an order to scout over the Aestham River toward Culpeper and so far as I might think it prudent to go, I left this camp on Wednesday [August 5] at 5 p.m. with 300 men of the First Massachusetts, First Pennsylvania, and First New Jersey Regiments.

The distance to the river being about 10 miles, it was nearly dark when I reached the fork of Gourd Vine and Hazel River, and my advance became immediately engaged with the enemy's pickets, who had a reserve toward our left on the south bank with a strong barricade. Getting information of another reserve still more to the south and in position to attack me on the right flank if I pushed toward the main road from Rixeyville to Culpeper, I moved more to the west and south until I crossed Muddy Run without seeing the enemy, which I am informed was in large force over this section on Saturday, withdrawing to Culpeper and still farther south, apparently to Gordonsville. Then crossing to the east and north over difficult ways, I encountered a small picket force 3 miles south of Rixeyville Ford, where the road makes an angle with the road to Culpeper, which I was told was strongly picketed with strong reserves. The last shots fired at me came from the woods bordering this road.

I recrossed the river at Rixeyville Ford at 2 a.m. and reached my camp at reveille without any casualty. My men report one rebel picket killed. The woods were very dark.

The result of my inquiry, as it seems to me, is that the enemy are still in strong force at Culpeper, with the main approaches well guarded, but that within two or three days large masses have fallen back from their old positions to that point or even farther south. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE B. SARGENT,

Colonel First Massachusetts Cavalry.

Captain A. Wright, Acting Asst. Adjt. General
