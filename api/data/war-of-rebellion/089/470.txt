WASHINGTON CITY, November 1, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

It is absolutely necessary there should be at New York an adequate military force to protect the public property and man the forts. Governor Seymour has, under a specious pretext, ordered out his National Guard, under command of a man named Green. No time should be lost in placing at General Dix's command, under loyal, suitable officers, not less than 5,000 or 6,000 troops. Western men should be sent if possible. If General Butler could be spared it would be well to send him.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, November 1, 1864 - 3.30 p. m.

(Received 6.30 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I ordered the brigade of regular troops to New York two days ago. The force sent there from this place will number about 1,200 in all. In addition to this General Dix was directed to retain the Seventh Infantry, which had been previously ordered here. Do you not think this sufficient force?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
