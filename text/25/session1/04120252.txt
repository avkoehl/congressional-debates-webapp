vented the catsstiopne w nch has occurred Now,
I will not undertake to say that the Batik of the
United States could have prevented the effect, afier
the causes were alloweu to exist and to operate,
but it could have prevented the existence of the
causes No such enormous expansion of bank
capital0, and with it all the sequence of e\ ¡Is al-
leged by the President, would have existed, as
I have shown, but forthe measu'es of the adminis-
tration, including the ovei throw of the bank
The President thinks that the Bank of E i"ian 1
has not saved that countrv frorn Sim dar disasters
Is not the fact notoriously otherv is"? Has it not
stepped m to relieve a id sustain the merchants and
the provincial hanks1
He ihm' sthe late "Undid States Bank did not,
m fact, prevent similar embarrassments This
opinion assumes, vvhat surely is not the fact, that
exactly such a state of things had place in the time
of that bank
He contends that a bank creited by the United
States would be pione to over issues, just as much
as the banks of the States This is a question of
fact, which the fact disproves We have hid
money-troubles at various tim^s, difftnng in de-
gree, but the two great convulsions, overtopping
all others, and distinguished each by that most fat il
symptom, a stoppage of specie payments by all the
banks, have been during tho«e two \ ery brief pe-
riods m our history, when the experiment of dis-
pensing with a national bank has been undergoing
<■     trial.
EXCHANGES
Much is urged in the Message on the subject of
domestic exchanges, under special leference to 'he
question of a national bank The President de-
nies that it is the duty of the Government of the
United Statts to aid m or to regulate exchanges
Upon dm point I shall hav e some other things to
say in the sequel, m connection with anothei part
of the Message
At the same moment almost that the Executive
disclaims tms as a duty of tne Government, he
admits the propuetv of its being done by ti e United
States incidentally, so far as its own fiscal opera-
tions contribute to that end This a Imission gives
up, it seems to me, the «hole question, both of the
constitutional power and of the official dutv of the
Government I do not contend for a natioaal
bank, simply as the means of regulating exchanges
It would 1 think, be ihe best fiscal agent the Trea
sury could have, and, at rty srnic time, it would
incidentally be the best nguhtir of exchanges
The example of the late United Slates Rink j unes
it We all know at how cheap a i ite, and how
regularly, it performed the functions of -n ex-
change agent Can put.itc individuals do this'
Can State banks do it ^ We see they have tried
to do it, and have failed , and the notes of the
United States Bank continue even jet, after the
extinction of lb charter, in cuculauon, as a cur-
rency of more pervading equality of value thin
any othets
But the Federal Government has express power,
by the Constitution, to regulate eommeice, and to
provide a standard of cutrency and e reliance The
same power is not given to the States Does not
this conclude the question of authority ? The Pre-
sident, indeed, suggests, that it is no mote the pro-
vince of the Government lo aid people m the lians-
ier of their funds, than in the transportation of their
merchandise Well, the Governmen , in virtue of
its commerce power, does aid people in the tians-
portation of their merchandise It pun ides navi-
gation Jaws, it constructs light-houses it regulates
pilotage, it improves harbors, it c e< rs out nvers,
as in the case of the Mississippi and the Red river
All these aie aids oí transportation Under the
same power if prec' i ks the Stales <rom imped ng
the transportation of merchandise, bv State mono-
polies ir otherwise Whil d st nation in principle
is there between lhe^e est sand "xohan°-ps which
are, equally wth the other trunks spik n of a me-
dium or instrument of coamerce7 Xa mis ad
minisliation, and the preceding one, have ex-
press! v favored plans of Governed' a I ti e\
changps, as in the case of the Treasuu bank
recommended bv the late President, m the " hum-
ble efforts" so pertinaciously made bj him to im-
prove the cwrency, and, more recently, in the am-
bitious aspirations of the Post Office Department
The President refers us to the wav these things
aie done in Europe I thank him for the illustra-
tion Exchanges, like many othei operations co-
vering the whole of Europe, are conducted in part
bj private houses, having correspondents in each
separate country Bu', even there, each principal
nation has a great chartered bank, which material-
ly aids in the process of exchange tn addition to
which, as fortunes accumulate bv primogeniture, a
rich banking-house lasts generation after genera-
tion, and acqu res a permanency andgeneiahty of
ciedit which can not easily be attained by private
houses in this counlr) But, with all this, it is not
a svstem to be received as a model for us First,
exchanges are carried on a1 grea'er cnarge than
they woul I be in this country with a national
bank Then, exchange, either on paper or on spe-
cie is to be paid more frequent y than here, owing
to the existence of a separate coinage and currency
meachcounlrv Noris this all This question is but
the particular under a general question The travel-
ler in Europe^ m passtngovera region of country no
larger than the Umied Stites, must at every hun-
died miles exchange one coin or credit for another,
just as he must piss inspection or pay duty at nu-
merous frontier custom-houses, have his passport
changed or used continually, and, it ma} be, make
his w ay through the ranks of hostile armies Is
this a state of things to commend to the imitation of
an American1 Our Gov ernment is a federal union
of States previously independent of one another
This union if States had for its primary objects to
provide internal peace, and combination of 'orce
in foreign war Subsidiary to these are unity and
uniformity of custom-houses and duties, of mads,
of domestic intercourse, (as evmc^d by the disuse
of passports ) and of enrrcucv, coin an 1 exchanges,
which as I contend are all one thmz; m principle
Our currency consists of 1st, metal as the consti-
tutional standard of value, 2d, bank notes, Ie<*al-
i7ed paper, received as a practical currency n lo-
cal dealings In ii tn! an 1 cash, and, Jd, drifts or
bills, eilhpr of Government, banks or individuals,
and either locil or otherwise, the medium of con-
tracts on time or distance Now, the Constitution
contemplates, and the interests of the people re-
auire, equality and unuormity of our currency In
proportion as the currencv is local onhjm its calcu-
lation, m proportion as it is of unequal value m
different p irts of the countrv, m proportion as the
citi/on or the men Innt is ob tructed m this re-
spect m the same proportion is th°^piiit of the
Constitution ínf-iiiffcd We can get along, as we
do now, subject to the mrey-ity of buying specie,
oi of exchanging bank notes half a divrn times, m
travelling over as many States We c< uld get
along, with different coins, with local banks, wuh
custom-houses on the frontier of each State, and
bands of cUstom-h-fu^e inspectors, with jealous
passports to be vised at every change of stage, as
they do in Europe andwtt/> distinctsoveteis;nfics and
consequent v art which bclorg to the same cateeory
of facts But lilt wise oi well to get on thus?
What is it, but simply the old quest on, Union oi
not?
THE UA\K CONTROVFRSV
The President refers to the controversy on ihe
subject of a national bank, which exists out of
doors, and the supposed opinion of a majority of
the nation, as bearing on the merits of the ques-
tion I can not admit this If it were a free,
spontaneous controversy—a contioversy unbiassed
bv the Executive—it might be entitled to cinside-
íation Who mad  this cont"Oversv'i Who got it
up' Did the bank! Sjrelv no* It was Tn no
respect for the interest of the bank to become m
conflict w ith the Executive, or to be the subject of
party contention It is a ccntrnversv. which the
late President diove the coun'rj into, a poliucal
dtviee, an engine of party m the hands of the ad-
ministration It is easy for the ^dm nistntion,
po sensed of Us vast power and patronage, to cre-
ate a controv er^v on anv pout Is it fair then, to
cite tha existence of a comioveisj, so got up, as
evincing the justness of the conlroveisj? Con-
gress passed Mr Clay's land bill, which would have
prevented an  accumulation  of suiplus revenue,
and many consequent evils, and the bill was met
with the late President's veto So Congress re-
chartered the bank, and he vetoed the bill Con-
gress refused to remove the deposites, and he did
it, by a high-handed stretch of arbitrary power. The
Senate lefused lo entertain a biH requiring specie in
payment for public lands, he exacted it by the
Specie circular. Congress rescinded the circular,
and he suppiessed the rescinding bill In fact, the
people, and Congress representing them, have had
all these political agitations forced upon them, like
the convulsions of the money market, by the ma-
noeuvres and the violence ot the administration
Gentlemen have asked us in tins House, whether
ve are ready to meet them on the issue oibank or
«a bank I reply, give mea fair field, and I am
ready to meet such an issue But w hat is to be
expected, on this, oi any other question, when all
the power and populanty of the hero of New
Orleans, all the rabid fury of the party piesses, all
the influence of the paid agents of Government,
all the army cf office holders scattered over the
country, are emplov ed to lash the passions of the
peonle into frenzy, and to mv stifv, delude, and
alarm the public mind, by heaping every epithet of
odium and of ribaldry on the head of the bank?
Ind shall the President now appeal to the dispute
itself as any evidence of the true sentiments of the
people'
THE  PRESIDENT'S PLEDGES
Sit, m conclusion of this part of the Message,
the Pres dent alludes to the pledges he gave, previous
to his election, in reference to this subject He
is pledged I see and lament the fact It is a mis-
fortune, I think, as well to the country as to him-
self There is a mistaken idea prevailing, as to
the non committahsm, so called, of the President I
think his opinions, on topicsor public controversy,
have been as distini tly avowed as those of othtr
statesmen Nay, I think that, in various ways, he
has committed himstlf more absolutely upon party
questions, than was wise Per laps he was impel-
led to this by the language of his opponents He
gave pledges m his reply to the North C?rohna
Committee, in his letter lo Mr Williams, m his
Inaugural Address Doubtless, also, he is yet more
deeply pledged to the late President, and to those
who surrounded that peisonage heie, as may be
mferied from the very significant letters of Gene-
ral Jackson, lately published in the Globe
Other Presidents, also, hav e come into office,
whose opinions were sufficiently known, at least,
by their acts, writings, or speeches The late
President, like his successor, gave formal pledges
on many points, such as non-re-electioi, repudia-
tion of party influences, purity of election", non-
interference with Congress, retrenchment and
economy, and reform of public abuses, and his
administration of public affairs was a standing vio-
lation of every one of these pledges, on the faith of
which he was made C. lef Magistrate I shoul 1
be sorry to see Mr Van Buren thus false to all
engagements But, if General Jackson, after
pledging himself to do so many things which were
iighl, foi felted his pledges by going over m each
respect to the wor^e alternative, it would seem that
Mr Van Buren, having pledged himself to do cer-
tain things which are wrong, might, with wiser in-
consistency, change for the better, in doing which,
he would but follow the example of Jeffer-on and
Madison, who, while m office themselves, adopted
some ot the very measures, which, in the time of
Washington and Adams, they were the loudest to
condemn Indned, men rise to supreme power,
nof unfrequently, by the help of piofessions, hon-
estly made, which fur her experience teaches them
are impracticable Nav, parties occasionally u«e
up their own professions, just as troops do th ir
ammunition, bv tht verj process of v ictory For
Mr Van Burtn 10 si^n a bill chartering a national
bank w ould not be a greater change of opinion or
policy, than it was for Mr Madison *o do the
ame ihmg And the time may veteóme when
he, like Mr Madison, shall perceive it to be the
dictate of honor and of patriotism to sacrifice his
prepossessions in this matter on the altar of his
countrv's good I will not contend, nor will Í
admit, as the arguments of many of his partisans
