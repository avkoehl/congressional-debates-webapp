Captain WIEGEL,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, Eighth Army Corps:

Send two of your best detectives in the train at 0.20 to Philadelphia to-night. A plot is reported to seize the boat at Havre de Grace. Some troops are there and others will go at once. It is though that the conspirators will be disguised as passengers. The detectives may discover or trap them. Instruct the detectives to confer with the commanding officer at Havre de Grace.

OFFICER IN CHARGE DETACH, EIGHTH U. S. INFANTRY,

On ferry-boat between Havre de Grace and Perryville:

You will proceed by special train, which will be furnished by mr. Crawford, superintendent of the railroad, to Perryville, opposite Havre de Grace, and there join your troops to the guard already stationed there. The senior officer will take command of the whole guard. you will be governed by existing orders to the officer now stationed there and the following additional instructions, which are rendered necessary on account of a plot having been discovered to seize the boat that crosses the Susquehanna at that point. You will station your troops all on the boat, and during the passage of trains will permit no one to leave the cars. To accomplish this you will station a guard on each platform and keep the passengers in the cars.

You will hold the balance of your guard in reserve, in readiness to assist if any attempt is made to overpower the guard.

As it is likely that the attempt to seize the boat will be made by rebels disguised as passengers you will watch them closely and deal summarily with the first man who makes any hostile demonstration. Should there be a concerted movement on the part of any number of passengers it must be suppressed at once. It is possible that the rebels may approach by boat. you are therefore directed to seize two small boats and place three trusty men in each, whose duty it will be to reconnoiter and stop all boats approaching the ferry-boat or bridges. You will arrange a system of signals by lanterns whereby the boat parties can warn you of the approach of any hostile force. You will see that your troops are constantly on the alert and remember that you are stationed there to save the ferry-boat from capture, and, if possible, the bridges from destruction, and to capture or otherwise dispose of any person or persons who attempt to seize or burn said boat or bridges.
