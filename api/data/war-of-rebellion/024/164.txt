broken and hungry, weary and ill-supplied. Draw everything possible from Memphis to help move on Holly Springs and let us concentrate. Appeal to the Governors of the States to rush down some twenty or thirty new regiments to hold our rear and we can make a triumph of our start.

CRUM'S MILL, ON THE HATCHIE,

October 7, 1862-2 a. m.

GENERAL: Since my last, McPherson occupied Jonesborough at 9 o'clock last night. Out of rations, having followed the main column of the precipitate retreat of the enemy. Hurlbut reports himself out of position and too much crippled to follow the enemy. I have ordered rations sent to Cypress for him and have begged him not to return to Bolivar until I can communicate with Sherman; I want him to appear to threaten the enemy. I think Sherman should go to Holly Springs by all means, and that the road should be opened to take supplies to him; think it could be done without much trouble. Telegraph line should be put up. The superintendent should immediate supply himself with a large stock of wire and supplies of all kinds that may be needed in the work. I repeat, it is of the utmost importance to give the enemy no rest day or night, but push him to Mobile and Jackson. Beg the authorities North to send us more troops. Ship everything you can; nowise our time; we must give the enemy to re-enforce or recruit. Every nerve must be strained. Everything will be sent to see that our troops lack nothing of the necessaries to keep them going. Among other things, rolling stock and material for repairs are needed.

A civilian must take the place of McPherson. He is needed in the field; he adds twenty per cent. to any troops he commands. Telegraph Quinby to come or send him down with all you can.

RIPLEY, October 8, 1862-9.45 p. m.

(Via Chewalla, October 9.)

I have to report that our advance occupied Ripley last night before 11 o'clock. Enemy formed their line of battle yesterday afternoon, expecting us to attack them, but retired before night. General Hamilton occupied Rienzi, and having received provisions, marched from there to Hatchie Crossing on Ripley road to-day, where he has been ordered to take post at Nolin's Cross-Roads, covering our communication with Rienzi and Kossuth. The troops will then be: McArthur on the right, Stanley next, McPherson covering the town. Cavalry division has been ordered to recruit, furnishing minimum number of scouts.
