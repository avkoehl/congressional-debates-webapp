General FITZ JOHN PORTER:

General McClellan says tell Porter that the work is done. Secesh driven from his camps. Success complete.

General S. P. HEINTZELMAN:

The general commanding desires you to regard your new line in front as merely a picket line, and your entrenchments as your true field of battle. If your pickets should be hard pressed they should fall back to the entrenchments slowly.

He also wishes you to cut out as much of the timber in the front of your works as possible to-night, so as to increase the range for the artillery.

General SUMNER:

The general commanding desires you to regard your new line in front as merely a picket line, and your entrenchments as your true field of battle. If your pickets should be hard pressed they will fall back slowly to the entrenchments, firing as they retire.

He also wishes you to cut away as much of the timber as possible in front of your works, so as to give you a more open space on your front.
