TO THE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN FORT LAFAYETTE:

I am instructed by the Secretary of State to inform you that the Department of State of the United States will not recognize any one as an attorney for political prisoners, and will look with distrust upon all applications for release through such channels, and that such applications will be regarded as additional reasons for declining to release the prisoners, and further that it such prisoners wish to make it directly to the State Department.

SETH C. HAWLEY.

WILLARD'S HOTEL, Washington, D. C., November 28, 1861.

W. H. SEWARD.

DEAR SIR: I am both pained and mortified to hear this morning of information given to you that I had acted as counsel in cases released from Fort Lafayette. Permit me to assure you on the honor to a gentleman that in no one of the three cases, viz, Colonel Berret, H. A. Reeves or J. McMaster, had I ever acted as such or received in any way directly or indirectly therefor any compensation. I mention those three cases specifically as being the only ones which I have any reason to believe were released through any application of mine on their behalf. I apply the same distinct and emphatic statement to any other released cases. And not only so but I have refused to receive from the parties named a refunding of money paid out of my own pocket, traveling expenses, &amp;c., on their behalf.

I should sincerely regret any loss or diminution of your good opinion, and I take this opportunity to tender to you my grateful acknowledgments for any and all kindness and consideration which you have
