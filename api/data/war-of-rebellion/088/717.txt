Major-General SHERIDAN,

Near Berryville:

From reports of deserters coming in at different times, and on different parts of our lines, we learn that Kershaw's division arrived in Petersburg last night. I think there is no doubt but some troops home arrived from the Valley.

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters, one from Finegan and the other form Harris, report no recent changes in Mahone's division. One of them-states that he heard rumors in Petersburg yesterday evening that two divisions of Longstreet's corps had arrived at Petersburg. He states that he also heard that Kershaw's division was one of them, and he supposes Field's to be the other. Another deserter from Davis' brigade,w ho just arrived, reports that he heard last evening that Longstreet's corps was all here; that the division which was in the Valley had returned. They moved from Petersburg last evening and took up position on the right of their lines.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Respectfully forwarded for the information of Lieutenant-General Grant.

The same information has been received from several other deserters, and appear to be confirmed by the fact reported by Major-General Birney that several brigades of the enemy were relieved by others from the trenches in his front last night.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
