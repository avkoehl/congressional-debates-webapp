HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, October 16, 1864.

Major H. H. WILLIAMS,

Pilot Knob:

The report as to the aggregate or Price's army is all too meager. General Rosecrans wants a statement of the whole aggregate by brigade and division, and, if possible, by regiment, giving the strength of each sub-division, the character of troops in each, the names of commanders, &amp;c. I have not heard of Cooper's division being along with Price's command here. Ascertain where it is. I suppose it is the command which includes the Indians, the reports of the presence of whom have been Cavalry arrives send a reliable guard to Irondale and Iron Mountain with instructions to keep the peace and preserve the property. I will send the ammunition to-morrow.

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

FRANKLIN, MO., October 16, 1864.

Lieutenant HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

By command of Colonel Hugo Wangelin I have assumed command of the First Sub-District. Have you any orders?

D. Q. GALE,

Colonel, Commanding.

FRANKLIN, MO., October 16, 1864.

Lieutenant HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

My scouts, and persons fleeing, report a large body of rebels and Indians south of Richwoods, in Washington County. I have sent part of twelve companies of mounted infantry to scout that part of the country.

D. Q. GALE,

Commanding First Sub-District.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 16, 1864.

Colonel D. Q. GALE,

Franklin:

The rumor of a rebel force of Indians south of Richwoods has no foundation in truth. Our troops occupy Potosi and have been in that locality for over a week. Our forces occupy Pilot Knob, and the telegraph has been in operation to that point nearly a week. There is a large force at De Soto and all along the line of that road.

By order of Brigadier-General Ewing:

H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
