LEXINGTON, KY., June 9, 1864--2 a. m.

Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army of the Ohio, Dallas, Ga.:

I have information from General Burbridge that Morgan has entered Kentucky with 2,500 men. This is corroborated by reliable information of a similar force being at Booneville, Owsley County. Mount Sterling was captured early yesterday morning. Four hundred rebels were at Pine Grove, eleven miles from here, last evening. I have detained Colonel Garrard's force, and with it and our own troops will protect Camp Nelson, and, if possible, Lexington also. Colonel Garrard commands the troops.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 9, 1864--10. 20 a. m.

Brigadier General E. H. HOBSON

(Via Cincinnati):

Shall I send train to Paris? How many cars, and what time should it reach there? Enemy appear to be making for Camp Nelson. Rebel column crossed Clay's Ferry road, ten miles out, at daylight this morning. Small rebel force reported at Georgetown, also at Paris. Preparations to defend Camp Nelson and the fort here complete and satisfactory.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

COVINGTON, June 9, 1864--12 m.

Captain DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Order Weatherford to move at once through Lebanon to Camp Nelson, and in that region direct him to pursue or attack any force he may hear of. Look for Lexington. Let Colonel Garrard, at Nicholasville, know what is doing and direct him to get arms from Camp Nelson if he needs them for Seventh Ohio Cavalry. I am very scarce of troops; am doing my best. I will mount 300 men in an hour or so. I learn nothing from General Burbridge. The One hundred and sixty-eighth Ohio will leave here in a few minutes on train. Don't send any train to Paris. There is a force reported coming in from Richmond. I want Lexington to resist anything that comes against it.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
