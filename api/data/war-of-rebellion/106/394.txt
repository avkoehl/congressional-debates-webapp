Hadquarters District of Arizona, Hart's Mill, Tex.:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I visited Fresnal, having left here on the 6th and returned on the 11th instant. I found the place to be a mining population of twenty-seven Mexican families, numbering about 250. They are chiefly employed by a Mexican (Francisco Padres), James Halstead, and L. J. F. Yager. They have seven arrastres of their own at work, and there were altogether twenty-five in use, the most of the balance reducing ore on shares for the above parties. There are twenty arrasteres not in use at present. There is another mine at Cababi owned and worked by nine Mexicans, in which Halstead has an interest. The Padres mine yields twelve marks to the bulto (of 900 pounds); the other mines somewhat less. The Cavabi Mountain is supposed to contain many silver veins. There is another mine called La Mina Prieta four a half miles south of Fresnal, in the Baboquivari range, which yields twelve ounces of silver to the bulto. It requires machinery to make it profitable, and is not worked at present. Fresnal is situated on a mesa on the bank of an arroyo, with permanent water (in dry season found by digging wells) in abundance. It is about one mile from the Picacho of Baboquivari. There is a large valey to the west, say eight to ten miles wide, and perhaps 100 miles long, covered with fine grass, mesquite, palo verde, palo fino, hermosilla, saguerus, biznagu, yucca, &amp;c. The grass is bare within two miles of the Fresnal. There is a rencheria of Papagos of perhaps 400 souls (at least bodies). They have forty-three jacales, about 300 horses, and an equal number of cattle, principally milch cows.

The distances are as follows:

Tucson to San Xavier...............................9

San Xavier to Coyote Springs...................34,79

Coyote Springs to first fork of Cababi road........6

First fork of Cababi road to second fork of Cababi road...........................................15,93

Second fork of Cababi road to Fresnal...........7,20

Total..........................................72,92

The distance returning are (not coming via San Xavier)-

Fresnal to first fork of Cababi road...........7,20

First fork of Cababi road to second for of

Cababi road...................................15,93

Second fork of Cababi road to Coyote Springs......6

Coyote Springs to Charco de la Martina.........7,44

Cahrco de la Martina to Tuscon................34,70

Total.........................................71,27

The road is good the entire distance. There is no water en route except at San Xavier and Coyote Springs. At the latter place there is a small springs up a ravine 1,900 yards from the road, which is permanent. There is another about 600 yards off in the Sierra, but is of little
