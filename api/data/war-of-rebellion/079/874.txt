The citizens on the south side of the county, especially in Denton's Valley, are in dread nightly of a repetition of an-other raid by the gang, and the loss of more property and the loss of some of their lives. They pray that you will detail a body of men to guard and protect the south side of the country of Washington and to hunt down the gang and bring them to punishment.

RICHMOND, November 1, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Tuscumbia, Ala.:

My letter of October 2 placed you in command of the armies in a section of country. When present with either army you must exercise immediate command while there, but to retain the contemplated freedom of motion it was designed that you should not relieve the general of the particular army, but, by retaining the organization, be enabled to leave at any moment without impairing administrative efficiency.

HEADQUARTERS,Tuscumbia, November 1, 1864.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood desires that if possible you will send a brigade of cavalry to assist Brigadier -General Ross in holding the enemy in at Decatur, General Hood thinks that since the brigades which went to Virginia with Williams have returned that you might be able to spare one for the above purpose.
