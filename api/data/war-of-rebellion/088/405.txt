Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Ferrero occupies from the Strong house the line occupied by one brigade of General Potter. He has been at work all night and reports that by evening the work will be completed. I shall then extend him to the left, relieving Potter's other brigade. The line in front of this brigade has been straightened and shortened to connect with the line of parapets and batteries in the Blick house opening. We are at work on this line now, and I hope to have it finished by evening.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

General Warren has been directed to continue pushing forward his pickets and to support them. The commanding general directs that you advance the pickets of your line, keeping pace with those of Warren. Your dispatch about your line indicates that Willcox's and White's divisions are not upon your line preparing it. If that is so, the commanding general directs that when General Warren moves forward you cover his right flank with these two divisions.
