General GILLMORE:

I do not desire you to assault the works in front. Why not mass your artillery in the skirt of wood that Major Brooks described? Prevent the enemy from doing anything more to it, and try and turn it; only move promptly.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, may 14, 1864-6.20 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding in the Field:

I recommend that Brigadier-General Ames, now at Port Waltahall junction, be ordered to report here to me, with all the command there except one regiment of infantry and one section of artillery. One half his colored cavalry, or even all of it, might be left there. If these works are to be turned it must be done in large force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
