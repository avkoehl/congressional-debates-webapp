HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., May 27, 1862.

Captain WILLIAM W. STUART,

Second Infantry California Vols., Commanding Fort Ter-Waw, Cal.:

SIR: The general commanding the department desires you to break up the post at Fort Ter-Waw and proceed with your company to Smith's River, north of Crescent City, and select a site for a post near where the Indians have been recently located. The post must be located within the limits of the Indian reservation, but not too near the Indian camps. The general desires you to consult with Mr. Hanson, superintendent of Indian affairs, with reference to this matter. Fort Ter-Waw will continue as the depot for supplies, and you will leave there such stores and property too inconvenient to take with you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
