abuses could not take place, except in times of
panic and distress, when dependant laborers were
out of employment, and struggling for bread
Sir, the Sena or ha , proffered me his advice,
which is, that I w 11 submit cheerfully and in good
temper to the change which has taken place in my
State, and retire with good feeling? towards all, and
not grumbling and complaining The advice (Mr N
said) was quite unnecessary, as he believed he had
already evinced , still it was good, and he should
certainly follow it His maxim v¡as never to de-
spair of the Republic, and he had not the least
reason m the world to do so, so far as respected his
own State He had every reason to be encouraged,
as he had had abundant evidence that the reign of
the Senator's fueids would be brief as well as in-
glorious If the Senator could see the facts con-
tained m a letter he (Mr N ) received by the last
mail, giving an account of the proceedings of the
Legislature, he would be satisfied that the triumph
at which there had been such rejoicings could not
last long, he would see that his friends were m
great trouble and perplexity, and much in the con-
dition of the banks, who were really their misters,
having made many promises which they weie
unable to fulfil He would find that, for then
treachery, faithlessness, and cowardice, they weie
visited with comphints, both loud and deep, at
every corner of the streets, not from political oppo-
nents, bu* from disappointed friends, to whom
their promises had not been redeemed He thought
one year would be the extent of their power, it
might continue longer, but he would assure the ho
norable Senator, for his special gratitiotion, that
there was not the least probability that it could
hold hold out urtil the great struggle in 1840
Sir, said Mr N as the honoiable Senator has
given me sime advice, which I hive received
kmdly and iDreed to lollow, I will mum the iavor
by offering a little tr lum I wish to remind the
Senator, of wh it his long experience must have
convinced him—tint in this changing world politus
weie, of ill thing?, the most unstable and llu<
luatinr, th it existing opinions and present appeal -
anees we * ofiui extremely deceptive, and tre
qnently led to dangerous conclusions Little
jeliance can be placed on results without look-
ing at the cab es xihioh have produced them, and
seeing whether they are abiding, or fleeting and tian-
sitory He hop< d the Senator would not suffer him-
self to be deceived by recent indications oí public
opinion, which may have pioceeded from temporary
causes Public opinion is extremely fluctuating—
principles alone are Mable and immutable There
is, however, one thing as to which the great miss
of the people never change It was that to «Inch
he alluded in the first speech ho de'ivued in the
Senate, in attemrtmg to explain the wonder! u!
popularity of tint venerable man who a year since
retned from the public councils of his countiy for
ever That one thing, su, is honesty The people
are honest, and they love honesty above all othei
thm¿s "I hey will forgive mistakes and eirois in
heir public servants, but it they ftn J that they have
been imposed upon, it is vain to think to m imlam
their confidence It the piescnt indications appa
rently so auspn ous to the Whig cause, are the
result ot a panic, of tempoiaiy causes—and still
more, if they have been ptodueed by deception,
he v. arnec' the Senator that it would be very unsafe
to bui d anv hopes upon them
These lie si me professions and some causes
which floniish only m adverse and calamitous
times Tne ncdieal profession, although one of
great merit, we ill know flourishes best when sick-
ness and distiess pievail Tne harvest of the phy-
sician is gathered in seasons of pestilence, and
amidst the s ghs and groans of the sick and ths
anguish of sucvivmg inends
There are some causes, also, that tlime best in
times of public distress and calamity And the
history of this country proves that this is the case
with that cause which, let it exist under whatever
name or form it may, combines the essential ele-
ments of aristocracy m our political system This
cause, ongtnallj known as Federalism, and since
called by all soits of names, which it is thought
may disguise its real character, has always suc-
ceeded best in times of aifficulty, embarrassment,
and distress.     Indeed, sir, it has never flourished
at any other period
When the country is in trouble, when business
is at a stand, when the people are in difficulty,
deot, and distress, this cause has flourished Hence
during ihe last war, when the country was almost
sinking under a pressure of difficulties, struggling
with the most powerful nation on earth, without
revenue, and almost without credit, the cause of
Federalism was prosperous beyond all former ex-
ample Receiving fresh vigor from the difficulties
and distresses of the country, its power soon be-
came foimidable and almost irresistible It pros-
trated every thing before it m the Eastern States
In his own State, the small, but fearleis and patri-
otic band of Democrats, who dared to stand by
their country when faction had pushed its mea-
sures to the very point of open resistance to the
laws, were apparently so reducel in numbers that
the violent party leaders of that day sneer ngly
said that there were not enough left to laught at
But, sir, when the war terminated, when the
dark cloud which had long hung over the country
passed oft, and the sun once more shone with
brightness on our fair land, it was found that the
Democracy were not dead, nor even asleep Al-
though they hid never succeeded in the State, the
very next jeir they came forth with an energy
which broke the ranks of Fedeiahsm and prostrat-
ed all their strongholds of power
The same occurred in his State and others after
the memorable panic of 1834
Sir, this cause, consisting of a combination of
all the elements hostile to the popular ptmeiples in
our Governnnnt, is at all times the s ime, and the
history of the past is the prediction of the futuie
It is a cause that is nourished and sustained by the
embarrassments ind distresses of the people It
rises as the coimtr) sinks, and sinks as the country
rises
The íecent embarrassment-, and distresses of the
country have ltnpirted to it that vigor «huh
springs only Imm public diflirnlties But as busi-
ness revives, and industry leturns toitsateust m
ed channels, as the gloom and darkness pisses
awaj, as it soi n must, the apparent bright pro -
peeli. oi this cuise Mill dmppear is has beni the
ease on all fnimer oceisions It is a cause tint
will not loar the light, that \ull not bear pros
pel Uy And Demucno}, oppressed and borne
down by i tempe rary picssure « 11 rise mn.rorat-
ed In tins suspen led aition, and hv its own in-
stinctive tntrgics will sprcid wider and broider its
influence in every direction, sweep n¡r a ay t very
thing that opposes its progress until it covers the
whole land, and fills with joy the hearts of all who
lore liberty and their country
After some furthei remarks fiom Mr CLAY,
Mr WRIGHT cal'ed for the reading of the New
York petition, and it was accordingly read
Mr W observed, that upon looking at this pa-
per itself, he found that it was an old acqumitance
—a sort of circuhr or travelling bank p ti'ion, of
which he had seen seveial The honorable Seni-
tor on his right had presented several of them,
and this came from i most respectable town of his
Stale He wis desirous of seem" what evidence
there was tint the signers to this pet tu n had
changed their political faith, and the only evidence
he ionnd was a note at the bottom of the petition,
signed by one individual in initials, and nhich
wis not noticed by the signers tht mselves The
petition wasasoit oi lithograph, mdeven man into
whose hands it came was entieated to disseminate
it as widely as possible , but many of them he ob-
served were signed by very few persons He
wished the petition to be printed with the names,
and as there were not many, the expense would
not be great He wished it to be sent to Jamaica,
in order that the people there might sea who it
came from When he heard the presentation of
this petition this morning, he must say that he
supposed it was a new one, and came fresh from
the people He saw so much evhdaiation m the
honorable Senator from Kentucky, that he could
have no other opinion, but he now saw that the
letter enclosing it was dated the first of March,
which was long before the Senator's project of a
National Bank was heard of.   He should not have
asked the question he did, if he had known that the
petition resulted from a state of things existing be-
fore the Senator broached his project The Sena-
tor gave as a reason why the c untry wanted a Na-
tional Bank, the great inequality of bank paper
Now he recollected that it was not very long ago
that an attempt was made to force the Treasury
to receive this depreciated paper Now if this pa-
per was so very depreciated as to be shaved twice,
they ought to rejoice that the attempt had failed
