HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Mondat, February 24, 1840.
The SPEAKER laid before the House the fol-
lowing communications, viz:
A communication from the Treasury Depart-
ment, enclosing a commun.cation from ihe Com-
missioner of the General Land Office, covering a
report from the Register an-t Receiver of the Land
Office at St. Augustine, under the law of the 26th
May, 1830, in relation to certain Spanish clams.
On motion of Mr. CASEY, referred to the Com-
mittee on the Public Lands, and ordered tj be
printed.
Also, a report in answer to a resolut on of the
House calling for information in relation to cettam
expenses of the Wisconsin Tenitory for the years
1837, '38, and '39. On motion of Mr. J. W.
JONES, referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means, and ordeiei to be printed.
A communication for the Comm ssioner of the
General Land Office, in compliance with a resolu-
tion of the House, adopted on the 10th instnnt,
showing the probable quantity and value of the
public lands of the United Sla'es, lying wiihm th«
geographical limits of the State of Tennessee, ac-
companied by a communication from the Se retary
of State of the State of Teunessee. On motion of
Mr. LINCOLN, referred to the Committee on the
Public Lands, and ordered to be printed.
Report from the First Comptroller, in compliance
with the act of 3d March, 1809, presenting a state-
ment of the account* which have remained more
than three years unsettled, and on which balances
are due. On motion of Mr J. W. JONES, ¡aid
on the table, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. JOEIN CAMPBELL wished, before Ih?
States were called for resolutions, to have thenri-
vilege to report one from the Comm ttee of Bfec-
tions; which was read for information, as follpw¡>:
Resolved, That the Committee of Electrons be
authorized to send for persjbns and pap/is in re-
ference to the contested elections fromflhe Third
Congressional District of Penniylvan/a, and the
Sixth Congressional District of Mas«*husetts.
Mr. DAVIS of Pennsylvania objected to its re-
ception                              í           i
Mr. RIVES said it wast impoyble for the com-
mittee to proceed with -tl e íntaístigation of these
cases, without the po «r isAiven to it. The
committee is now d ,rog nt thijre, for ihe want of this
power.                             ' /
Mr. J. CAMPBELL mrJved a suspension of the
roles to enable him to offer the resolution.
Mr. KELM inquired of the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Elections, Mr Campbell, if he supposed
this resolution gave the committee power to appoint
commissioner  to take testimony
Mr. CAMPBELL said the committee had had
that subject under consideran in, and had come to
the conclusion it would b s better to submit the
question to the House.
The question was then taken on the motion to
suspend the rules, and it was carried without a di-
vision.
The qnest ion then arose on the adoption of the
resolution, when
Mr. BIDDLE said that he understood that ob-
jection was made to the appointment ef commis-
sioners by the committee. Now the resolution, he
supposed, merely authorized the examination of
testimony by the committee itself. He wished to
hear the resolution read, that he might be certain
on this point.
Mr WILLIAMS of North Carotina said that the usual
course had beon for the contesting parnés to be at the trouble
and expense of taking testimony under the laws of the States
where the contested elections had been held He objected to
the giving this power to the committee, on account of the great
expense that might be incurred m consequence of it The
committee, he said, might, unt'er this power, send for eve y
voter in Ihe contested districts, and bung them here to ttstify
Mr VANDERPOLL asked if the committee could not dele
gate the power to some pel sons in the States of Pennsylvania
and Massachusetts, to take depositions for them The ex
pense would be very considerable if all the witnesses were to
be brought here
Mr CAMPBELL had no sort of objection to modtfying his
resolution so as to put in the words " and to examine witnesses
by commission.' and the resolution being thus modified, was
read
Mr R GARLAND theught the modification unnecessary
He was on the Committee of Elections of 1837, and they were
told by the Speaker that the power to send for persons and
papers gave them the whole power oí taking testimony by com
mission
Mr m.I.MORE said it did seem to him that a little conside
ration ought to be gnen to a grave subject like ihis It would
be recollected thatlthe House was, in these cases, exercising judi
cial powers, and he believed it was not the habit of any of our
courts lo delegate their powers It «truck him that this power
should be exercised by the House onW, and not by a commit
tee He had no objection lo giving the power in this paiticular
instance, but it was the establishment of the precedent that he
objected to
Mr BIDDLE believed that the usual course in cases of con
tested elections, was for the parties themselves to name the
commissioners How was the committee to get their informa
tion, so as to make a proper designation of the commissioners?
Would they not get their information from one of the candi
dates, and if so, was it no likely that the power thus exercised
would be prejudicial to Ue other? Knowing the passions and
prejudices that would be brought to bear, he was unwilling to
give the committee this power
Mr BROWN of Tennessee observed that the committee
having entered into an examination of the Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania cases, found that their powers were inadequate
to the attainment of the requisite testimony, and their investí
gallons being thus suspended, they came before the House
and asked for the necessary and ordinary power to send for
persons and papers We have, said Mr. B, heard enough of
these cases to know that we cannot progress with them with
out having the facility of taking depositions, in the respective
neighborhoods where the elections have been held It «seemed
lhai one of the principal ebiections to the giving of this power
to the committee, of issuing commissions, was that it
might be abused Now, he would suegest to the House, that
this difficulty might be removed by giving the appointment of
the commissioners to the Speaker, for it * ould seem to him,
that it would make very little difference whether they were ap
pointed by the Speaker or the House He hoped the resol u
linn offered by the chairman would be adopted, and that the
House would not take any alai m at giving a power to the com
mittee, which had often been given before, and which never
had been abused
Mr PARMENTER remarked, that one of these cases [the
Massachusetts one,] was somewhat different from the ordinary
cases which came before the House The grounds taken by
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. [Mr Diddle,] weie, t at it
was the duty of the competitors in cases of contested
elections, to designate (he commissioners and to collect
the testimony He would remark that in the Massa
chusetts case there was no competitor contesting
the «eat of the sitting member 1 he law of that State required
that the Repiesen'ative tlected to Congress shomd have a ma
jonty of all the votes given, and it was the people of the ninth
election district in that State, who set forth in their petition
that the gentleman claiming to represent them did not receive
a majority of their votes according to law Now it followed,
that if the doctrine of the gentleman from Penn ylvania was
sustained by the House, there would be no one in that district to
designate the commissioner, or collect the testimony It could
not be expected that the trouble and expense involved would
be borne by any particular individual
Mr PETRIK1N here moved the previous question, which
was refused—aves 77, noes S3
Mr TOLAND then moved to postpone the resolution till to
morrow
Mr CAMPBELL of South Carolina said it appeared fiom
the testimony of gentlemen who had been long members of the
House, that the power to send for persons and papers carried
with it the power to appoint commissioners for taking testi
mony Surh was also the opinion of the committee, hut to
obviate objections that had been made he had modified his reeo
lution, so as to gel the sanction of the House to the power of ap
point ng commissioners The first proposition was merely for
the usual power of sending for persons and papers, and with
out this power Ihe committee could not move one step For
the purpose of getting a direct vote of the House on the pro
position as first offered, he would withdraw the modification,
and then the question would simply be on giving the comm ttee
power to send for persons and papers
Mr BOND desired ti k low of the chairman of the commit
tep in what event they con emplated the necessity of sending
for persons and papers He understood that i' had not been
usual in the case of cont sted elections to bring witnesses to the
Capitol for the purpose of taking their testimony Tie knew
that, in the case of Letcher and Moore, the partus were sent
home, and that months elapsed before they returned with their
testimony We know also (said he) that, in the New Jersey
case, the committee have sent home the parties to take testi
mony Now he wanted to know what it was in the Pennsylva
nia and Massachusetts rases that made it necessary for the com
mittee to have this powei
Mr CAMPBELL stated that, when there were not a great
number of witnessen to exarnne, so as not to occupy much time
and involve a heavy expense, it was deemed the most satisfac
lory course to have the witnesses examined by the committee ,
but when, from their distance from the seat of Government, and
the number to be examined, a more than ordimry consumption
of time and money would be involved, it would be better to hive
their depositions taken by a commissioner apponted for that
purpose
Mr BOND said, that, in the estimation of some gentlemen
that would be considered a great number, which, in the estima
tion of others, would be considered a small one He thought
there was no necessity for the adoption of the resolution, and
that it would be opening the door for a heavy expeise to the
Government It would also be a departure from the established
usage of the House
Mr GRAHAM, after calling for the reading of the resolution,
observed that he saw no necessity for its passage It would be,
in his qpir ion, the setting a bad piecedent, foi he never was
aware of such a power haring been granted to a Committee of
¿.lections With regard to the remarks of the honoiable gentle-
rrnn from Massachusetts, [\lr Parmehter,] he saw no foice in
them, for, if the people ol the distuct would not take the trou
ble to collect the evidence necessary to suppoit their petition, it
would be considered that they did not take much interest
in it lie thought that all the committee could or ought
to do, was to prescribe the regulations for taking testi
mony, and leave the contesting parties to do it If there
were laws in the States where the depositions were tobe taken,
providing regulations for taking them, they could be taken un
der those laws but if there were not, the committee had the
powerof prescribing all the necessary regulations
Mr RIVES observed that it setmed that no matter in what
shape the subject was presented here, the committee would
have difhValties to encounter If, said he, we ask lor power to
have depositions taken, it is objected to as giving the committee
too much power If, on the other hand, said he, we ask for au-
thority to send for persons and papers, for the purpose of taking
testimony here, this is also objected to for the game reasons
The gentleman from North Carolina [Mr Graham] says this is
unprece lented The gentleman spoke without a sufficient ex
animation In nine cases out often of contested elections, Mr
R said, this power had been given Why weie these objections
madei Did gentlemei desire a thorough exanination into
these contested cases? If they did, why object to giving the
committee this power* The gentleman from North Carolina
says that it is the duty of the people of the contested district in
Massachusetts to furnish testimony to the House Did they know
what sort of testimony the House required* Did they know
that certified copies of thepo'l books were wanted to ascertain
whether their Representative had received a majority of the
votes according to law? But it was objected that the power to
send for persons and papers would involve a very heavy ex
pense, and bunga vast number of persons to Washington.
Now there might be persons here in this city by whom maienal
facts might be established in re ation to those cases, and why not
let the committee have these persons before them? But sur-
pose they are not in the city, why not let the committee send lb
the States for them? Were gentlemen so afraid of expense that
they are willing to prevent justice from beingdone? II they w ere
in favoi of a fair investigation into these cases, they ought io
give the committee power to collect testimony They ought
not to object to the committee having such evidence before
them as would lead to a fair and impart al examination Tfi 
object of the committee was not to do any thing that they had
not the right to d > They would not send for persons and pa-
pers unless the House gave them that power, and unless the
Housodid give it lo ti em they could not proceed one step in
their investigations, for they were now doing nothing for the
want of it The power had been conferred on them in the New
Jersey case, but net m the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
cases It was a power usually given to the Committee ol Elec
tions It had not heretofore been refused, and if it was refused
now, it would be equivalent to saying that the House did not
want a thorough investigation into these cases Mr R con
eluded by moving the previous question
Mr BIDDLE asked it the mam question would not bs on Ihe
motion to postpone the resolution till to morrow
Mi BANKS sail the mam question would be on the resolu-
tion, the previous question cutting off the motion o postpone
Mr BRIGG8 said the previous question cuts offamendments,
but this was not in amendment, but a motion to postpone
The SPEAKER said the rule applied to a motion to postpoi e
as well as to amend, and the question, therefore, would be on
the resolution
Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee desired, before the question was
taken, to read the law on which the practice of the House, in re
lation to this question, was founded, but was ruled to be out of
order
Mr RIVES having called for tellers, Messrs Ramsey of
Pennsylvania and Brioos of Massachusetts were appointed,
and the question on seconding the call for the previous ques-
tion, was takjn,when the tellers reported, ayes 94, noes62
