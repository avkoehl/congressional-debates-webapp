HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 1862.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: By the last steamer from the Gulf of California I received a communication from each of the U. S. consuls at Guaymas and Mazatlan, which I have the honor to transmit ehrewith for the consideration of the War Department. * I also inclose copies of communications from the rebel General Sibley,+ and his agent, Reily,++ addressed to the Governor of the State of Sonora. A copy of the communication from William L. Baker, our consul at Guaymas, I have transmitted to Flag Officer Bell, commanding U. S. naval forces on this coast, for such action as he may deem proper. Up to the time of the steamer's departure from Guaymas and Mazatlan it was not positively ascertained what reply had been made to Sibley's communication by the Governor of Sonora, although it was generally understood that he had declined to enter into the arrangements proposed by the rebel general. By the next steamer I shall address a communication to Governor Pesqueira, referring to the advances made to him by the rebel chief, and assuming, as a matter of course, that the Governor has promptly rejected the propositions, and intimating at the same time that the Government of the United States expects that the authorities in the State of Sonora will not permit any rebel forces to enter their country under any pretext whatever, and that the very amicable relations now existing between the Government and people of Sonora and the United States would be jeopardized should the insidious proposal of the rebel general be for a moment entertained. #

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
