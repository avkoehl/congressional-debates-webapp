HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-EIGHTH BRIGADE,Camp north side of Stone's River, December 29, 1862.

WILLIAM P. McDOWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Division:

SIR: I have the honor to report that we arrived here all safe, and that I have occupied the position as per orders. The enemy were here in force on Saturday, but left here on hearing that our forces were advancing, burning the bridge over the East Fork of Stone's River, and barricading the highway with rails, &amp;c.; consequently it is impossible to advance farther on the pike in this direction, as the river (East Fork) is not fordable at this point; may be below. Will examine the country as thoroughly as possible under the circumstances, and report by courier in the morning.

Yours, truly,

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,Near Stewartsborough, December 30,]1862]-1 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

GENERAL: Shall I order Colonel Starkweather back in the morning, and, as the night is inclement, and I not better defer marching from this camp till daylight? It is now 1 a.m.

Very truly, &c.,

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

General ROUSSEAU:

General Thomas has been absent since morning, and I do not know how important it is for troops to follow. I received an order from him to-night to follow him at early dawn. You will use our own discretion in regard to marching. I understand the enemy is leaving, or have left Murfreesborough, and that our troops are pursuing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel WALKER,

Commanding First Brigade, First Division, Center, Nolensville:

A cavalry reconnaissance made this evening has developed the presence of the enemy (apparently heavy force) at the ford of Stewart's Creek, 2 miles in advance of the outposts of our right. Such being the case, the general desires you to be wary, guarding well your front and exposed flank.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
