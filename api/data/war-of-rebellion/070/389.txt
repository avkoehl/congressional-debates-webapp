CAMP NEAR WINCHESTER, May 5, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER,

Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: Your letter is received. You are requested to make such use of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry as you deem proper, but it is requested that you do not make use of troops at Remount Camp for duty on the railroad, but, being as they are under your direction, you are at liberty to use them in case of an emergency. Will send you 200 or 300 mounted men.

Respectfully,

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., May 5, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER:

SIR: I have a few more particulars of the affair at Piedmont. The rebels were commanded by McNeill. They first attacked and captured the guard at Piedmont, then went to Bloomington Station. They destroyed a number of cars at the latter place loaded with commissary stores; also capturing about 100 unarmed men, who were on the mail train coming east. These men were paroled. They also captured 36 horses at Piedmont; also stopped and burned a freight train.

Respectfully,

G. J. LAWRENCE,

Operator.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 5, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER,

Harper's Ferry:

I have seen General Kelley. He took command of our troops this morning and chased the rebels away from the railroad. There were only 100 rebels. Three hundred more are in this vicinity, or between here and Martinsburg. General Kelley thinks they may attack us here to-night. The telegraph is repaired to Wheeling. I shall order the artillery and infantry to concentrate in the fortifications here to-night. We have only about 100 men in all. Please telegraph me any order you wish executed.

S. F. WOODS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., May 5, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER,

Harper's Ferry:

There are six guns here which have been posted on different roads. Their support was so small I thought best to concentrate them. Was this right?

S. F. WOODS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
