HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 13, 1862.

General MORGAN, Cumberland Gap:

What is the average strength of the rebel regiments as far as you can ascertain? Observe carefully any indications of a movement toward Virginia.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, August 14, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Corinth, Miss.:

General Buell has made requisitions for your two divisions near Decatur. Replace them by two others.

H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief.

CORINTH, MISS., August 14, 1862-9 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding:

Telegram received. I have ordered two more divisions east; those on the road to move to Decatur. Information received last night shows that Price's forces have advanced to Guntown. He was expecting yesterday the arrival of 15,000 re-enforcements-from Georgia, probably. The best information I can get indicates that a feint only is intended here for the purpose to hold our troops, but, sending so many troops away, may it not be turned into an attack?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, ALA., August 14, 1862.

Major-General GRANT, Corinth:

Please let me know exactly what force you place at my disposal and where it is to cross the river; I don't understand from your dispatch of to-day. The report of troops marching from Chattanooga or Rome to Tupelo seems to me altogether improbable.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
