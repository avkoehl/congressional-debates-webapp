la view of that statement I can veil see that
the amount of additional appropriation in tbis
bill, although less than the amount of the esti-
mates, will be absolutely necessary. I think
this amount will be necessary even if the law
shall be amended in mauy particulars so as to
restrict the amount of printing that shall be
done. The work for the custom-houses is
absolutely necessary, and a very large amount
of blanks are needed for the internal revenue
department. The cheapest way in which the
work can be done is for the Government to
buy its own paper and run its own printing
office. I am satisfied of that from the investi-
gation T have made. The Committee on Appro-
priations have made a calculation of the amount
of work that will be necessarily done, even if
abuses were corrected, and the amount is pro-
vided for in this bill. The statement which
haa been read at the Clerk's desk is evidence
of the amount and character of the work which
is imposed-upon the printing department. If
there is too much discretion in the hands of
the heads of Departments, and if there is
extravagance in any direction, it is our duty to
reform the law which leads to those extrava-
fances, and not to say that the public printing
epartment shall be crippled for the want of
the necessary means, because that would only
result in a deficiency.
I have only one further remark to make, and
it is that recently the ten-hour system has been
changed for the eight-hour system. The result
is that it costs twenty per cent, more for all the
labor done in the Public Printing Office, and
when gentlemen vote here for the eight-hour
law they must understand that they have got
to add twenty per cent, to all such bills as this
for the employment of laborers in the different
Departments.
Mr. ELA. I rise to oppose the amendment,
and I wish to state this fact, that instead of an im-
mense amount of work coming down from the
Post Office Department to increase the neces-
sity for an appropriation, if gentlemen will look
at the report of the Congressional Printer for
themselves they will find that in 1868 there was
$55,000 worth of printing done for that Depart-
ment, while it was diminished in 1869 to $30,000;
so that instead of there being an increase in the
amount of printing done for the Post Office De-
partment, the amountlastyear was $25,000 less
than theyear previous. And so in regard to the
matter of binding. Instead of there being an
increase in the amount of binding done for the
Treasury Department, in consequence of these
blank-books which have been spoken of, if you
look at the report of the Congressional Printer
you will find that the binding for the Treasury
Department in 1868 cost $99,000, while for the
last year it was diminished to $76,000; showing,
the report of the Congressional Printer is to
be relied upon at all, that with the diminished
business ot these Departments comes a dimin-
ished amount of printing and binding, and that
T>r-° "ece8®ity for this increased demand
°r 'nUnS Office. I can account for some
of the extravagance of that place. It is the

place where the specifications of the Patent
Office are printed. The cost is not in the work
done by t he printers, but in the supernumeraries
packed in there, and holding places at high pay.
Now, when the gentleman from California
[Mr. Sargent] talks about the increased cost
of the printing coming from the Departments
in consequence of the eight-hour system of
labor inaugurated by law, if he will examine
the number of pages printed during the years
1868 and 1869 he will find that the printing has
cost no more under the eight-hour law than
under the ten-hour law.
Mr. SARGENT. Will the gentleman allow
me to interrupt him a moment ?
Mr. ELA. Not now, for I want to make one
more statement first: that during three months
of the time reported under the year 1868 the
eight-hour law was in operation in that office.
Therefore, for three months of that time, while
these specifications were printed at the Gov-
ernment Printing Office, the work was done
under the eight-hour law.
Mr. SARGENT. Do I understand the gen-
tleman to say that a printer can do and does do
as much work in eight hours as in ten hours ?
Mr. ELA. I answer the gentleman by a
statement from the report of the Congressional
Printer.
Mr. SARGENT. That is not an answer to
my question.
Mr. ELA. That will answer the question of
the gentleman if he will wait until 1 give it to
him. In the year 1868 there were printed
61,986 pages at a cost of $194,267 88; in 1869
there were printed 64,258 pages at a cost of
$173,209 92. And if any confidence whatever
can be placed in this report of the Congres-
sional Printer, then it costs no more under the
eight-hour law than it did before that time
under the ten-hour law.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. I do not desire to protract
this debate any longer. I rise merely to call
the attention of the House to the occasion
there was for the lecture which has been read
to them by my gentle colleague, [Mr. Butler,]
whose conversion to reverence for the bureaus
and Departments seems as sudden and as re-
markable as that of him who journeyed to
Damascus. The House will take note whether
a word has fallen from any gentleman here
to-day which justifies any such lecture as has
been delivered to them upon the propriety of
their conduct. Now, to be told that the Rep-
resentatives of the people, upon the question
of the appropriation of the people's money, are
not about their own business when they are
scrutinizing carefully and diligently and faith-
fully where every dollar of it has gone, is a new
doctrine. For one I apprehend it to be my duty,
whenever such a question is before the House,
faithfully and calmly, justly and impartially, and
without fear, favor, or affection, to diligent in-
quiry make where every dollar of it has gone,
or may or will go. So long, sir, as I may have
the confidence of the House and of the country
I shall continue to pursue this course, without
regard to lectures here or elsewhere. I recog-
nize the courtesy that is due and proper
between all the Departments and all the
branches of this Government. I recognize
the fact that within their proper spheres the
Departments have their duties to perform.
But I do not intend to lose sight of the fact,
also, that within my constitutional sphere I have
a duty to perform, nor am I to be diverted
from it by the lectures of anybody.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. When I offered my
amendment I certainly was not aware that this
item was intended to include the Department
printing And if I have not been misled,
there are other items in this bill which relate to ]
the printing for the Departments. For instance, i
under the head of '' Patent Office'' there is a !
special appropriation for the publication of the
very reports to which the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts [Mr. Dawes] referred a few minutes
since. I suppose that similar items may be
found in the special appropriations for the
other Departments. Bat after the explana-
tions that have been made, I will modify my
amendment so as to reduce this item of appro-
priation to $300,000. .
Mr. MAYNARD. I rise, Mr. Chairman, for
the purpose of propounding a question to the
Committee on Appropriations, and especially
to the gentleman from California [Mr. Sar-
gent] who gave us some statistics a few mo-
ments ago. I desire to obtain a clear under-
standing of a matter respecting which there
seems to be some misapprehension. The opin-
, ion generally prevails, and I confess I had fallen
'! into the view myself, that the printing of'Con-
' gress proper, the printing of the two Houses,
l: has very largely increased, or rather that the
expense of it has increased. I have before me
the appropriation act of 1868, which appropri-
ates for the binding of documents for the House
of Representatives $100,000, for the Senate
$50,000. In this bill we find appropriated for
public binding $450,000. In the appropria-
tions for the current year the amount for pub-
lic printing is $400,000; in this bill the amount
of the corresponding item is $500,000. The
amount appropriated for the current year for
paper for public printing is $400,000 ; the cor-
responding item in this bill is $450,000. I
would be very glad to be informed whether the
cost of the printing ordered by the two Houses
of Congress has increased materially within
the last year or within the last few years. The
impression prevails throughout the country that
Congress has been very reckless, very profli-
gate, very extravagant in regard to the expenses
for public printing. If such is not the fact we
ought to have the benefit of the statement. I
trust the gentlemen who have investigated the
matter will, while this debate is proceeding,
state the facts.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I rise for
the purpose only of saying that I am very far
from "lecturing" or desiring to " lecture" any-
body. I desired simply to bring back the at-
tention of the House to the fact that we are
dealing with the estimates made by high public
officers of the appropriations necessary to carry
on the Government. I would leave the matter
there did I not want to save a large part of the
sum expended in public printing, by once for all
passing in a bar against the supposed analogy
between Saul of Tarsus and myself. I have
heard that comparison nineteen times and a
half in this House; and as it occupies so much
space in the Globe I wish it might be kept
j standing, so that everybody might read it and
that it need not be repeated. There are two
or three things which I think might as well be
omitted in future discussions in this House,
because the country well understands them:
first, that I voted for Jeff Davis in the Charles-
ton convention ; second, that I experienced a
sudden conversion ; and third, that I have not
been in the Republican party so long as some
other people. All this is true; and I have no
doubt that in the olden time there were some
who stood by Judas in preference to the other
disciples, because he was the eldest. [Laugh-
ter.]
Mr. ELA. I move to amend the amend-
ment so as to make the amount of this item
$400,000. This was the amount required in
1868, and I think it is about the amount re-
quired for the coming year. In that form I
hope the amendment will be adopted.
Mr. SARGENT. I rise to oppose the amend-
ment. I think the fact should be known that
the congressional printing has not increased
during the last ft^w years. I send to the Clerk s
desk to be read an extract from some remarks
made in the Senate by Mr. Anthony, the chair-
man of the Committee on Printing in that body.
The Clerk read as follows:
" The cost of the printing ordered by both Houses
of Congress lor the year ending September 20. IS08,
was 1656,833, and for the year ending September 20,
1869, it was $689,486. The total amount of printing
ordered by the two sessions of the Thirty-Third Con-
gress was $2,220,715, and the amount ordered by tne
