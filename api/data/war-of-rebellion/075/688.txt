DALTON, May 10, 1864.

General MARTIN,

Near Calhoun:

General Johnston directs that you dispose your forces so as to keep yourself fully informed of the movements of the enemy, and to keep the commanding officers both at Rome and Resaca informed.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 10, 1864.

General DAVIDSON,

(For General Loring,)

Rome:

General Johnston directs the remainder of Loring's division to remain at Rome until General French is within one day's march of Rome.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

ROME, May 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General MACKALL:

I am near Rome with twelve guns. Any orders?

ROBERTSON,

Lieutenant-General.

ROME, May 10, 1864.

To his Excellency, President DAVIS,

Richmond:

The first of Loring's brigades arrived and sent forward to Resaca; second just in; the third will be in to-morrow morning early. General Johnston telegraphs he wishes me to hold the two last here for the present. French's advance brigade was to leave Blue Mountain this morning; the others will follow in succession. Ferguson will be in striking distance day after to-morrow; Jackson's division in thirty-six hours after. No time has been lost, and the command is in good condition. Dispatch from General Cantey at Resaca, just received, reports the enemy falling back from Resaca. Generals Lee and Forrest were at my headquarters the day before I left. Satisfactory arrangements made for the defense of the department with the force left them.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

ROME, May 10, 1864.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON:

I have asked orders in ciphers, but on examination I found my cipher box out of place and cannot decipher the dispatch. Shall I report to your headquarters?

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
