PINE BLUFF, ARK., September 29, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The rebels have taken up position again on the river thirty miles below here. A force variously estimated at from 300 to 1,500 has crossed to the north side, and is engaged in gathering up corn and beef. All reports concur in saying that Marguder is at Monticello, and that he is collecting an infantry force there. He is reported to have said, "Nothing has ever been done in this State, and now something must be done."

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

I begin to feel very uneasy in regard to the state of our supplies. I do not believe the river can be depended upon as a means of transportation. I therefore recommend that supplies be forwarded at once by a train with a strong escort. If this is done it would be best for the train to come down on this side the river and return on the other. We are already out of many articles of subsistence, among them the very important one of salt; of others only half rations are being issued. If a train is sent it should be loaded almost wholly with salt meats, sugar, coffee, and salt. I am also very anxious to receive the ammunition for which I made requisition by telegraph some four weeks ago. Nothing further of special importance from the enemy. They keep their front so perfectly picketed that it is difficult to find out what they are doing. If it is true, as reported, that they have established themselves in force on the other side of the river in my opinion they should be driven out, as we will have to depend upon that country for forage during the coming fall and winter.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Little Rock:

The enemy seem to be actively employed in collecting corn and beef-cattle on the north side of the river. There are also three brigades of Texans reported between Chowning's Ferry and Mount Elba, scouting and collecting forage.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
