MACON, MO., June 14, 1864.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK:

I have this moment received the following dispatch from the sergeant in command at Glasgow:

Four Union men killed last night near Keytesville, supposed to be in retaliation for those killed by the Federal scout. Great excitement. Union men fleeing from the country.

I have sent a message to Major Leonard. I start a captain and 50 men to Chariton at once.

JOHN F. WILLIAMS,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 14, 1864.

Colonel J. F. WILLIAMS,

Macon, Mo.:

You must speedily look after Chariton County. Send a good officer with sufficient force to Keytesville to clean out the bushwhackers and restore order. There is a large delegation of Union men here from Chariton County, and every man indorses H. T. and they plead a continuance of his reign. Do you get any facts touching his late campaign?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, MO., June 14, 1864.

Brigadier General CLINTON B. FISK:

I have the report from Chariton County directly. I hear a thousand rumors. Should think Captain Crandall or Lieutenant Billings better posted, as they are nearer the scene of operations of H. T. Got a letter from Judge Hall, which I forward to you. Think his action ruinous to the Union cause.

JOHN F. WILLIAMS.

MACON, MO., June 14, 1864.

General FISK:

Captain Brockman has gone with all the available mounted force to Chariton. Captain Smith will be in to-night from Brookfield, and I can leave in the morning if it is still thought best.

JOHN F. WILLIAMS,

Colonel.

Colonel J. F. WILLIAMS,

Macon:

Go immediately to Chariton County yourself and see to getting out the militia in sufficient force to drive out and exterminate the bushwhackers. Judge salisbury telegraphs me from Allen to-day
