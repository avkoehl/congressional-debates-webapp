Brigadier General M. JENKINS,

Commanding Division:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you move your command down to the rear neighborhood of Strawberry Plains to-morrow morning. See what arrangements you can make about laying a bridge. With the ten pontoons and the three boats on the river you may be able to lay a foot-bridge at least. Do not have the bridge laid until General Longstreet arrives, but make all preparations with your forces near Strawberry Plains. Cavalry pickets across the river will be sufficient.
