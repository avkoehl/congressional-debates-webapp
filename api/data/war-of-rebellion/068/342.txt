The engineers connected with it will repair the road to Ely's Ford, attracting the attention of the enemy as little practicable. The general commanding further directs that you place guards on all the occupied houses on or in the vicinity of the roads passed over by your command, and in advance, toward the Rapidan, so as to prevent any communication with the enemy by the inhabitants. You will draw in all these guards when you move from Richardsville. Call in your detachments at Morrisville and Grove Church; if the river is past fording have the bridge put down to cross the above very early in the morning at Kel
