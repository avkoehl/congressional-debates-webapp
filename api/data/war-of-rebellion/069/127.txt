JERICHO MILLS, May 23, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have two divisions across and my bridge most laid, my line a mile out from the river. I am still of the opinion they are only trying to delay us by holding the bridges. They gain time every-where perhaps by the slowness of my crossing. The bridge that I reported 2 1\2 miles above me, it the one I believe that leads down from Chilesburg. I think General Wright should extend out and get possession of that for the crossing of all the trains, if needed. By advancing my crops I uncover I think all the bridges; but I shell hardy be in good condition to do so till late.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Carmel Church, May 23, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

Your train is parked here. What do you intend doing with it? The head of Wright's column will be here in half an hour. He was pushed to take post on your right, but now that you have crossed the river, he is directed to take post on this bank to support you. Wright will interpose between you and your train, unless it is got pout of the way, and will probably do so with his troops you can move it.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Jericho Mills, May 23, 1864-4.45 p. m.

General MEADE:

I parked my train on purpose to get it out of the way of General Wright's troops. I shell not watch of it to-night, and if he will let that part pass after his troops so that the rations can be issued it will be all want.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
