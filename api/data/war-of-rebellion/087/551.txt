longing to a regiment whose term of service expired the day previous, I was obliged to make use of the services of Surg. M. K. Hogan, U. S. Volunteers, surgeon-in-chief of the division, as an aide, he having volunteered them in that capacity, and rendering material service in addition to the performance of his other duties. The other officers of my staff who were present, Captain C. J. Mills, assistant adjutant-general, Captain J. W. Hudson, Thirty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers, engineer officer, and Captain E. E. Howe, Twenty-first Massachusetts Volunteers, ordnance officer, discharged their duties with gallantry and efficiency.. I would respectfully refer you to the reports of my brigade commanders for the names of other officers who distinguished themselves. During the action my left had become separated by considerable interval from General Willcox's right, and, owing to the darkness and the density of the woods, the connection was not established until daylight of the 20th, after which works were thrown up, from which, in the course of the day, they were withdrawn to the edge of the woods and subsequently to their present position, leaving the picket-line as before, with reserves in the works referred to.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. WHITE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Army Corps.
