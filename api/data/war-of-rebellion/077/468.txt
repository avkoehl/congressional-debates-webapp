MEMPHIS, TENN., August 21, 1864.

Major-General Forrest, with three brigades of cavalry, attacked this city at 4 a. m. to-day, making a sudden dash on our pickets and riding into the heart of the city. They were repulsed and driven out, with considerable loss. They obtained no plunder, but about 250 100-days' men were captured. They left General A. J. Smith's front at Oxford the evening of the 18th, and made a forced march of nearly 100 miles. General Smith has all my cavalry but about 400, and I have taken measures to notify him, and have him fall upon them and intercept their retreat. The whole thing has resulted very satisfactorily so far. What cavalry have is harassing their rear.
