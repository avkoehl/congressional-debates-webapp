have visited the scene and made investigation of the facts connected with the recent Abolition raid upon the Combahee River and the atrocious conduct of the enemy engaged in it, and have to submit the following report of facts, gathered from every available source:

Some three of four weeks preceding the 2nd day of June, 1863 (the day of the raid), Major Emanuel, with his squadron of cavalry, of Ruttledge's regiment of cavalry, who had been previously stationed near Georgetown, in the Fourth Military district of South Carolina, reported under orders for duty with his regiment in the Third Miliary District of South Carolina, and was ordered by Brigadier-General Walker, commanding, to take position and command of the post at Green Pond, on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, between the Combahee and Ashepoo Rivers. He was by special order directed to acquaint and familiarize himself and officers with the localities and lines of defense in the district of country under his command, and for that purpose was furnished with an accurate map of the country. (See Inclosure A.) Instructions for picket duty were furnished him, ordering pickets, even if few in number, to engage the enemy, and at all events to fire signals and retire, closely attention was very soon thereafter called to an extract from an Abolition paper giving intimation of some projected raid by the enemy's forces from Hilton Head. He was continued to increased vigilance, and received general instructions in view of an engagement with them. (See Inclosure C.) About this same time a written notice was property to the interior. Major Emanuel had also with him Captain Bomar's company of light artillery.

On the morning of the 2nd of June, 1863, Major Emmanuel being with his command at Green Pond, and having a picket force at Field's Point of at Combahee Ferry, on the pontoon bridge, of 5 men, in charge of Corpl. W. D. Wall, Company F, about 7 a. m. a courier from Lieutenant Hewit, commander of outposts, stationed at Chisolmville, reached the camp, informing Major Emanuel that there gunboats were at Field's Point landing troops, and a few moments after another courier, stating that a gunboat was steaming up the Combahee River and was within 1 to 1 1\2 miles of the pontoon bridge.

Lance-Corporal Newton, chief of the Field's Point picket, states that about 3 a. m. of the 2nd June, 1863, he first saw two steamers about 2 miles in the river or sound below Field's Point; that the night was bright and he could see a long distance; he watched them until they came near; he taken mounted his men and fell backs about 300 yards, dismounted, and leaving the horses went back to the Point. He saw them land from 8 to 12 men, who went up the bank of the river, and he also heard them launch other boats. He immediately sent off a courier with the information to Lieutenant Hewitt, commander of outposts at Chisolmville, about 10 miles distant, and soon after sent off another courier. The party which had landed then took a road leading to the rear of him, and having only 5 men left which him he felt compelled to retire, especially as their arms were inferior and unreliable. He fell back some 300 yards. The enemy, being re-enforced, saw him and advanced up the causeway, having 2 white men in advance, the others marching by fours, but cannot say how many there were. Sending off another courier, he still retired, the enemy following for 1 1\2 miles to the cross-roads, he keeping them in sight. There was no firing on either side. Beyond this point
