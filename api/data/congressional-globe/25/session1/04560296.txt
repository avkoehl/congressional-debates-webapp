Making public officers depositories—Mr, Preston,
Senate.
tend to abolish the banking system, and substitute specie, or,
as that is inmovible, an nredeemable Government paper, a
continental cm rem y, by which tins Government shall have the
unlimited control ol the whoie piopeity of the count* yi Ate
none of these your purposes'* Why, then, demand specie, and
reject the notes of specie paying banks'* If you do not intend
byijour divorce to have a better medium of pa> ment than
that which the poopíe u¡íe, what is the object of your measure^
Andif you establish for youiself this better medium, j on make
that oi the people still worse, you not only abandon them, but
aggravate their disuesses J fun e always held the trt e policy
of this Government to be, that m the exercise of itb granted
powers, it should so shape its policy that the incidental effects
of its measures should operate to the g >od of the community—
that the collateral action of ita money power, for example,
should be so regulated as to sustain the currency, íehe've the
embarrassments ©f commerce, and facilitate the business of ex
change If theieweie in our community anv bloated million
aire, any Rothschild or Baling, who irom the extent of his
operations could influence and contiol the moneyed affaiib of
the country, and who by that influence had induced distress,
and difficult), and embarrassment, and, m the mid tot it,
should demand the "Constitutional Currency," with what
burning indignation would a suffering and insulted com
munity denounce the wretch, and drive him Irotn oui bor
ders1
I hold it to be a clear proposition, Mr President, that this
Government is bound not to make for itself a better currency
than that of the people, and it results fiom thr-*, that n the cur
rency of the people is not good enough foi the Government, it
should suggest measures foi making it so 1 he United States
Bank effected this object, that you have decoyed, and by gen
eralconaentit isnottobeievivfd Ihe same object canbeef
fected by a constitutional limitation upon the banking powei
By this means you will have a sound currency for the people
and for the Government By this means you may continue the
safe and long tried policy of the lesolution of IS16 By this
means you at once íestiam and ¡strengthen the State liihtitu
tions, you give them vigoi bj miming, and you will en
able them for ever to supersede ail pit-text for a. United States
Bank
There aie, Mr President, some gentlemen who aie opposed
to any measure which has for us object the restoi a ion of a
sound papei circulating medium, who^e eyes and ears cm de
light in nothing but the ghttei and jingle of metal, and whose
happy hallucinations continually picture to their fancy asoit
f Saturnian reign, a golden age, i pabteial state of political
implicity and beatitude,exemptftom vicissitudes, amidst peine
lual sunshine and perpetual peace Of these romantic pohu
cians there are but a few, and they would do well to study the
most authentic chronicle of that ancient king, to whose eaineu
prayer the mischievous deities gtanted the powei ol convening
all he touched to gold, ami of whom the vciv winds prod umed
to mankind

Certainly, sn, the idea of establishinga puie specie < m rency
f#r this numerous, commercial, and tapidly giowmg people, is
very chimerical    Th  purchase ot the specie requisite fui this

quence of it     The vast consumption of the precious metals, in
various manufactures, and the diminished prodmtton of the
minea, ha-ve enhanced their pnce to a degree tfeat would make
them a very expensive medium of circulation, while they au

ference to them, will be whollv mistaken "   I should be deeply
gueved to think so    I should lament to believe that we aie so
adrift upon an unknown ocean, with an unknown heaven abo\ o
us, that the light of the polar star can no longer reach us and
that oui only hope for a safe navigation through the peiilr

Put, sn   on the subject of an inconvertible Government paper
the past stoo piegnant with monitions tobe disiegarded    His
Urv has erected warning beacons on all sides of us    Our co
lonnl, our lcvolutionary histoiy, the old Congres?, all the
states  concur in exhorting: v« to avoid this fatal evil     The
Constitution has embodied md p^ipetuated the terroisofour
anéele i     "No State shall l^sue bills of credit " In this clause,
=-1 ísdtelared the bitter expenence of the Revolution    Ivoith
Carmna, my colleague supposes, has furnished an exception
to the history of her sifter States md the world in the success of
her Pioc money, as it was called    The history of that affair
makes no exception to the geneiaf destiny of Government mo
ney    Jt fell below par, it embarrassed and confused the finan
cial action of the State for veiy many yeirs and wis finally
burnt) with thiee or fom times its imount m counterfeits, by
the 1 reasnrei of the State    My colleague s researches have not
enabled him to cite any othei instances than this of the Procla
mation money ol North Carolina, and whatever weight thw
may be entitled to I am persuaded is agimst his proposition
while the old Congress ind, I behp\e, every one of the revolu
tionary Mate1- afioid woful examples of the disastrous futility
of Government paper    It is impossible that it should be othei
wise, foi   the primal law, the fundamental pnncipl ,  the
living soul of currency, is that it be propeity, or be readily
conveitible into it    Convertibility makes cuuency    Paper
is money because it repiesents propeity, and losing the lepre
sentative quality, it is but paper, and there is no magic in Go
vernment to make it otherwise    This necessary incapacity of
Government to convert itself into a manufactory of money is
one of those limitations upon despotism that the friends of free
dom cannot too much rejoice m   and surely, Mr President, if
the question weie whether we should, if we could, endow this
ledeiativc agency with sucha monstrous power, would we ven
tuie upon iU   As guaidians of the lights of the Sutes, as jea-
lous asseiteisof the limited chjracfei of this Government, as
advocates and lovers of fiee institutions would we give this
tremendous power to this? Government*   Ino, sir    If we must
have a Government papei   it this absoibinsr and destructive
aggrandizement of Government powei mu«t beconfeiredj give
it to the States sir, and do not convert tins Government into a
money manufactory    Sn, I will not trust this Government
with such a power, no matter who admmisteis it, even if our
own wise and pure Washington, (all will feel how extravagant
the supoositio  i ,) even if he weie  at tie head of affairs
Could I then, sir, entrust it to a party whoso wi etched misma
nagement and incompetence have brought us to this mourn-
ful conditioni   Shall I be called upon to confide greater powers
ovei the ciu rency to those who, with such poweisas they have,
havepioduced so much disoider, or, rathei, sir to state the

ushi\e eivtu testimony of tht ir financial abilities if we aresa

Ioi ne, Mi Piesident T do not at ill share the confidence
m this Government which my colleague avows 1 look upon
it with in habitual distiust and jeilou«y «maipened instead of
b1 mted by íeeent events My colleague «ays "I íejoice to

e\pimged the tecords of the Senate who have perpetuated
their cont ol, by i smgithe patronage of the Government and the
plundcied money of the countiy in the hands of one President
to make his «ucces-or I see before rap these men avowing,
vindic i ire, and exulting in all that they have heretofore done,
ttd in x Idinnng that they will persist m the same policy All
tl is I «¡pe and I cannot give thorn my confidence Let them
ie ign let them acknowledge their incompetence, and te tify
