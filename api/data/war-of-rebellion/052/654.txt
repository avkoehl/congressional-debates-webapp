General Stanley is going in the morning, and desires to start at 4 a. m. With a little exertion I think they can be prepared to start at that time. They must be ready to start at 5 o'clock at the farthest, in order to make their march before the heat of the day.

I am encamped on top of the mountain. Have to go to the bottom for water and forage. Have heard nothing of any rebels about here.
