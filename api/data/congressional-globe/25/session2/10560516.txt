do not believe the gpntleman from New York intended this, bu1
still his reasoning goes to that extent The framers of our Con
siuuuon doabiless knew what they were do^ng They ioresaw
that the (rmeniment which they weie constructing would bt,
expe isive m its admimsliation but, notwithstanding this, they
were deteimined toestablibii it, because m no othei way could
tht liberties oí a fiee people be preserved
Now, I would nomoie disppt e with the militia becaase they
are expensiv*, thanl wouldch^n^ethe Government because it
is tuoie expensive than a moiaichy Ine rtison m one case,
it stt-m-  tn me, is pjst as good ai.it is in the othei TfieCo isu
luu m useif hds given to the militia a certain tank m rhc Govern-
ment i' has pointed out certain duties Dr them to pel foim, it
habdeclaied that these duties belong appropriate^ to the mill
ia, that it ts more safe forafree ptepk to icl> upon them than
to trust to legulai troops, &^ Under these cutumstances it
t'oes not becume us at the ptesent dav to pretend that wo hive

If it bhouM be pioved beyond all doubt that the militia were
more expensive thai legulai troops (Mi W said,) he would
i ou be willing to dispense with them, a id reiy solely on the !at
ter lie wouldfetiiladheie to the mailm" ol wisdom pomiü

But( aid Mi W ) I am unwill tig to admit the fact, as stated
by th° gentleman fiom. New York to wit that regular uoops
aie cheapei than the militia Then services may cost les  foi
theumeiiej aieemployed, but that is not a correct view of the
casD foi theregulns whethei emplcycd in active service oi
rot, whether engaged in actual campaigns asamst an enemy or
lying at in n ei-,e ingamsons co t the Government about the
t.arnt imount oi money, wheieaa the mihtia, when not in actual

at home fake foi example, a period of fheyeais, during one
hat* or two ihu K of which it is i ecessary to employ enhei the
militia or regulai troops If \ou lely upon the littei, you are
(blige I to engage th^rn for the whole penod of h\ e year« but
if you rely upon the mihtia, vou may employ the a only when
their ¡ser wcei aie warned, and ha rehe\ ed fiom the expert e of
supporting them at -any other time In th s vpvof the case,
it must be eudent (=aid Mi W) that the mihtia are less ex
pen ive than the tegular aimy, and the-efore the Government
ought to depend on thefmmer, andrt-jcct the latter, in every se
ríes of legislative acts
The gentleman from New York [Mr Bno:ssoi<.]had mtro
dticd to ii e notice of the Ilou&eye teidav an account render
el against the Government by some of the militia lately eh
gaged in thescivicein ¡he State of Alabama Mr W said he
could not teli why this account was exhibited to the view oi the
Housev if it was not for the piapoco of discrediting the miiitia,
of throwing upon them some odium, and foitilym? the idea
that it was cheapei to ea_,age regular tioopsfti our defeice

REMARKS OF MR. ROBERTSON,
On Virginia,
In thellouseúf Rpjne^entatirtb, Thursday, June S3,1838—
On rhe bill to Incieabe the Army
Mr ROBf.RTbON said he would detain the eommitke hut
a few mono t-s He wasopposed to the con tempi (ed increase
ofthearmv and «till m  re to the principles upon wnich that
increasr w i p ol> idVnCatel H-1 saw no wee Mty, ml ed,

as it wi* ca *ed rmgh be t o ibidere 1 as at an en 1 Oi i rtla
lions with O 9it Britain weie es* miiilv pacil It i^ true,
we ha I an n tiled question m relation to tK Mame bounda
ry, b it nagoi ifiois were pending, and no one had ven'ured to
plact tiio üft sity of augmenting our ¡aiiitaij force on the
ground of an tpprehended rupture with Gi eat Britain    Such
aground would not be likely to have the best effect in bringing
our negotiations to an amicable close We are, in üuth, srr,
(said Mxr R ) at peace with the world, and a proposition is
now suddenly made to double our military establishment So
far as any addition may be shown to be necessary to protect
the Indian frontier, none would hesitate to grant it, but our
present establishment, if completed, would comprise piobabiy
between seven and eight thousand men, and theie is no em
ployment for them any where except on the Indian frontier
Ordinary laborers, oi, at most, a few soldiers, are quite suffi-
cient to keep the forts in a state of preservation let ihe
whole force, then, except what may be required for that pur
pose, be withUiawn for the defence of the frontier settlements,
so long as there may be indications of hostility m that quarter.
This force would be more than sufficient to awe oi íepe! the
Indiai s ThegeotJeman from Arkansas üiitoelf, [Mr Ybil^
does not, tf 1 Correcdv understood himj ask for inore than five
thousand troop i
But, sir, we are told of disturbances on the Canada bordéis,
also, and that is the tiue secret or rather the avowed ground,
on which the increase of the army is uiged The gentleman
Irom "New York [Mi Bhonson)gives us to understand that v*e
are m need of a military polioe Yes sir, we want an army,
not to contend with ioreign enemies, but to quell the rebellious
«pint of our own citizens on the „boi leisof Canada Ihe
gentleman from Maine [Mi Ev \ns] u Is us the civn aiithont>
(annot or will not icstram the Savvies* individuals who seem
disponed to take pai t m the Canadian revo t The civil ofhceis
wiii not arrest, courts and juney will rot convict and punish
We must have a standing army, then, in asíate of peoce, to
enforce the execution of our tews against our own citizens
Sir I look upon this as a dangerous and alarming doctrine,
which «should be met at the threshold It seems as if we have
forgotten the veiy elementary principies of free government-,
ond aie íesolved to breakdown every barner erected hy our
anctetois against despotism Ido not mean to say ihat the
ltbeity of the country is seriously endangeied by the addition
now proposed tobe made to our military establishment The
danger is in the principle on which that increase is demanded
th& precedent of raising and keeping up a standing army m
time ol peace to enfoice the civil authority Establish thTb
preceden', and you will find yourselves, at no distant day, and
b fore perhaps you suspect your danget, under the dominion
of a military despot The principie i(«elfisthe principie oí
military despotism In the earlier periods of our history, the
Slates were jealous of standing at mies, now, sir, they aie pen
tioneis, it seems, for the boon
The State of New York, with between two and three millions
of inhabitants, cannot, it setms, execute the laws without the
aid of a military force furnished by the Federal Government.
And what, air, is your aimy to do? Make war upon those
whom, we are told, the courts and juries refuse to punish?
No one will go the length of sugg€stmg so monstrous a pro
position Gentlemen *>ay it is wanted for the purpose of arrest
ingthose who would violate our neutiahty What s., if they
flv or ie-si*.tl Shoot them down there h no o hei d emative
but todo that, oi suffer tharn to escape Bit say they yield or
aie captured What then 1 Are they to be dragged lor trial
before a military court' No they are to be turned ovei, we
ire told, to the civil authouty Why «ur tho very pretext tor
calling in the militaiy is the alleged refusal of the civil autho
nty to act against the oifendeic Of whatavail is it o bung
to trial before a civil tnbnnal those whom it will instantly
di^chaigei Oi will you surround your halls of jus ice with
FrEPtorun bands, and compel your punes and lodges to con
demn at the point of the bayonet'* 8n I am unwilh ig to be
lieve that the great State of New York is unable, bv cort^itu
tion^l means, to pie ent her citizens from violating the neu
tiahiy it becomes us to observe If however, she should fad
I admit it is the duty of thi? Government to mterpese But
how, en ? Not by a,\tandmg aimy The fnmersnf the Con
stimtion contemplated no «uci5 lecouise They exrit^ Jygave
to Congress f he powei of providing for cüimg out the mdma
for the purpose of executing the law  of the Union and de&pr -
iate must be the condition of the country when no dependance
can be placed either upoL the civil authouty or the great br dy
of the militia But the riilifia now, sir is the theme of den
sion, as, indeed, is the Constitution itself Standing arming
only, it seems, cai be religion, and upon the same pimciple
that they are now requned on the boi ders of Canada^ we shall
have them no doubt, in ca^e any discontent shall be manifested
at the proceedings of ihib Government stationed hereafter
upon the holders, or m the interior t f the Sta t«, to awe them
into submission Sh, disguise it ao you will this attempt to
enforce obedience to the civil authority m time of peace, bv
means of astandingaimy, this scheme of what the gentleman
from New l^ork [Mr Bronsov ] m soft phrase, t^rmsa mih
tm y poUce, is a dangerous innovation—a striking and most
alarming proof of the rapid dec ine of Republican principles
One Other question, sir andlamdoue The piopobed aug
menta'ionoftneregularforce hu been estimated by a gentle
man who pieceded me(Mr Bell) as likely to cost three mil
hons of doliarsper annum 1= this a tune to add this heavy
amount to the enormous and extiavagantexpenditures already
authorized, and which ereatly, u i« thought, excee i our revenue
for the current year1 Leave ou of view the odious purpose
which in part, ie, avowed as the objeet of the measure, ani the
force, I repeat, aheady authoi ¿ed juder exisung laws, is fully
adequate to protect the India iroptiei fc"r if a humane po
