Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 8, 1864-9 a. m.

Lieutenant-General POLK, Demopolis, Ala.:

Your letter by your staff officer was received this morning. The rapid arrival of your troops and your presence are the most important things now. After having by this rapid concentration succeeded in beating the enemy in front, we will be in a condition to execute your plan by Guntersville. If cavalry, for instance Ferguson's, can be spared from your department, its presence near Kingston would be most valuable in giving security to our communications.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
