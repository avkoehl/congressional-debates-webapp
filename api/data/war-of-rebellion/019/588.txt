If Coffee has crossed the Osage certainly, there is no force left that can even threaten Sedalia.

I will order Loan back into his division, directing him to leave a portion of his force at Lexington if you desire it.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 20, 1862.

General TOTTEN,

Sedalia:

If you prefer it I will leave General Loan in command of Lexington, and let Colonel Huston join you at Sedalia with such force as General Loan can spare from the defense of Lexington.

I wish to leave you to act according to your own judgment.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SEDALIA, August 20, 1862.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD:

Am just off in direction of Clinton with 1,400. Thought I could raise more. Your dispatch received. Would like Huston to march with all General Loan can spare to --- down, to receive instructions from me. Let Huston be directed to assume command upon his arrival at Sedalia. Shall communicate as often as I can.

Brigadier-General.

V. While in the field all that is necessary for the subsistence or transportation of any command will be taken from rebel sympathizers. But it is to be distinctly understood that this is to be done in an orderly manner and only by order of the senior officer present. Nothing so soon or so strongly demoralizes a body of soldiers as license to pillage or plunder, and any unauthorized taking of property or any waste or wanton destruction of the same will be punished with the utmost rigor of a severe code. Commanding officers of troops are warned that they will be held in every particular responsible for the conduct of their troops, and must punish with due severity and on the spot any theft or improper conduct of their troops on the march or in camp.
