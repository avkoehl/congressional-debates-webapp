HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,

Fort Smith, Ark., May 1, 1865.

Colonel W. A. PHILLIPS, Commanding Third Brigade:

I forwarded the subpoenas to witnesses in cases of Wattles and Crafts, but the distance is so great that I do not believe they will be able to get here. If the cases can be tried without them it should be done. I have no news of importance. A Saint Louis paper of the 24th which I saw states that "General Blunt passed through the city a day or two since on his way, but I cannot believe he is coming here. General Reynolds has Major-General McCook in command at Helena with one regiment, and I have no doubt he knows Blunt too well to send him here. The same paper has a dispatch that Kirby Smith's army is disbanding. Jeff. Davis is understood to have crossed the Mississippi River and gone into Texas, &amp;c.

Respectfully,

CYRUS BUSSEY,

Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Commanding District of South Kansas:

GENERAL: In accordance with paragraph 11, Special Orders, Numbers 103, current series, from these headquarters, you are charged with the reorganization
