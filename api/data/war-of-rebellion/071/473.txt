(Received 10. 50 a. m.)

General KELLEY:

I find the iron-clads here. Captain Petrie had to fall back here from Back Creek. Rebels there in force. One regiment of cavalry seen across the river and four companies on this side. Iron-clads made a narrow escape, the rebels being this side of them. What shall we do; go to Sleepy Creek and fight, or fight them here? Captain Petrie thinks he can whip them at Sleepy Creek.

C. J. HARRISON,

Captain.

CUMBERLAND, July 27, 1864.

Captain PETRIE, Hancock:

I am just advised by General Hunter that he has sent General Averell with a cavalry force to Hancock, on the Maryland side. Could it have been Averell you saw this a. m.?

HANCOCK, July 27, 1864.

(Received 3. 55 p. m.)

General KELLEY, Cumberland:

Iron-clads just from Back Creek. The bridge burned. The number of rebels at the bridge by actual count, 300; those seen on opposite side may have been Averell's. After the iron-clads left our forces and the rebels fought for about an hour. Colonel Thoburn and Colonel Curtis were at Sleepy Creek, having got cut off from their commands. The iron-clads took them to Cherry Run, where they crossed to go to Williamsport. They were in hard condition, shoes being worn out; no horses. They got lost from their commands in looking up their men. It is reported that our forces hold Williamsport and have been re-enforced by 17,000.

C. J. HARRISON,

Captain.

Captain OVER,

Military Commander, Wheeling:

You will arrest at once all officers and men found in Wheeling, without proper authority, and send them to this place. Officers and men have most disgracefully fled from the front, and are alarming the country by their most outrageous reports of the late battle. Please show this to the Governor.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

PITTSBURG, July 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY, Cumberland:

Would like to assist yu, but it is impossible. Have only five companies 100-days' men, and they are ordered this morning to Harper's Ferry.

THOS. A. ROWLEY,

Brigadier-General.
