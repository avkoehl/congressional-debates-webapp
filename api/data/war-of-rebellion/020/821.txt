twenty seconds the hulk sank. On moving up to the torpedo-boat we discovered her entirely uninjured, with a very small quantity of water in her, more than half of which was there before the explosion. From all appearances the spar is uninjured.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS D. LEE,

Captain, Engineers.

[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, March 13, 1863.

Respectfully referred to Commodore Ingraham, with the recommendation that as many boats as practicable of the boarding flotilla (say at least one dozen) should be fitted up at once with Captain Lee's spar torpedo, not only to defend the harbor against iron-clads but to blow up the blockaders at night.

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., March 13, 1863.

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN,

Commanding, near Jacksonville, Fla.:

It is impossible to spare a man at this time. The general leaves all things to your discretion and judgment, as at this distance cannot instruct intelligently. Order people of Jacksonville out of place if you think proper. Report present state of affairs.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, S. C., March 13, 1863.

Brigadier General H. W. MERCER,

Savannah, Ga.:

Hold one brigade ready to support General W. S. Walker if practicable. Have those box cars been furnished him? Reports of Fort McAllister are received.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., March 13, 1863.

Brigadier General W. S. WALKER,

Pocotaligo, S. C.:

Enemy's movements must be closely watched. Act not with precipitation, but be always prepared to act at moment's notice. General Mercer will support you if practicable.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
