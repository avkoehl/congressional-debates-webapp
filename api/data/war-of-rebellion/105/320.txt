report herewith inclosed, and marked A. * The wagon train arrived at Camp Henderson a short time after dark on the evening of the 15th of June, with animals very much worn down, having drawn heavy loads over a very rough road. The morning of the 16th I took up the march for the valley at the east side of the Steen's Snow Mountain, the valley in which Lieutenant Waymire, First Oregon Cavalry, had a fight with the Indians early in the spring. On the 18th I arrived at the foot of Steen's Snow Mountain, a distance of fifty miles from the mouth of Jordan Creek, in a west-southwest direction. Road very rocky. This valley affords an abundance of grass and water, and here I established a depot, threw up a redoubt of sufficient capacity to contain the entire camp and quartermaster's property. While engaged in rendering the depot secure I sent the Indians to scout the country to the south of Steen's Snow Mountain. They returned on the evening of the 21st, bringing with them four captured Indian women, who reported the men belonging to their camp in the vicinity of Harney Lake.

The morning of the 22nd I started for Harney Lake, passing along the east base of the Steen range of mountains in a northeast direction for twenty-five miles, passing the earth-works thrown up by Lieutenant Waymire last spring. On the 23rd I passed over the range of mountains cutting several of the head branches of the South Fork of the Malheur River. On the 24th, reached the south side of Malheur Lake. From here I traversed the south side of that lake; passed over a low sage brush range of table land to the southeast end of Harney Lake. Finding it impracticable to pass the marsh that connects the two lakes at this sea son of the year I passed entirely around Harney Lake, and on the afternoon of the 28th reached the northeast end of the lake. Saw no traces of Captain Drake. The lake water being very salt and grass poor, on the following day I moved out in a northeast direction to Cricket Creek, a tributary of Malheur Lake, and encamped, intending to scout for Captain Drake and Indians. Late at night George Reynolds, the guide of Captain Drake, rode into camp accompanied by four of the Indians belonging to Captain Drake's expedition. From Reynolds I learned that Captain Drake had not been to Harney Lake, but had passed to the north, going around the east and of Malheur Lake; was then on my trail marching after me. I mustered at that camp, and on the following day moved across the valley in a northerly direction to this place, where I was joined by Captain Drake and his command. Found his command in good condition and 100 strong. With the two commands I will start in the morning direct toward Canyon City, intending to clear the region of John Day's River of Indians within the next thirty days, an undertaking presenting no great difficulty, in my opinion. Captain Barry with his infantry remains at the depot. I can but regret that I did not reach this vicinity sooner, but as you have already been advised of my reasons for not moving up the Malheur River I will not now repeat. Since leaving Fort Walla Walla I have traveled 813 miles, making forty-six camps. This does not include the scouts made by my officers. I would now gladly give my men and animals some rest, but do not deem it advisable until the murderers of Lieutenant Watson and the plunderers of our people have been chastised.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. CURREY,

Captain, First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding Expedition.

ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters District of Oregon, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter.
