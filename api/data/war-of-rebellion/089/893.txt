GENERAL: Just received from City Point the following telegram:

Agents from Richmond report the following: Early's command arriving in Richmond. Troops were coming in and going to Petersburg all night day before yesterday evening. Yesterday morning they commenced arriving at Petersburg. Field's division has moved to the left of enemy's line, and taken position on the Nine-Mile road.

Early's command, since the withdrawal of Kershaw's division, of Longstreet's corps, consists only of the reorganized remnants of Ewell's old corps. Our latest information of the strength of this corps is 12,000 muskets.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
