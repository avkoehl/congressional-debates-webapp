REMARKS.

Since last report General Milroy has been ordered to report to General Kelley, and General Kelley has notified these headquarters that he is ordered to report the whole command to General Schenck. No reports, therefore, have been received from Generals Kelley ad Milroy, and this report, as to them, is made up from former reports.

The Thirtieth, Thirty-seventh, and Forty-seventh Ohio, and Fourth Virginia Regiments of Infantry, under Brigadier-General Ewing, were ordered out of the district December 28, and sent to General Grant's command, on the Mississippi River, and joined the Fifteenth Army Corps.

Yours, very truly,

A. LINCOLN.

Withdrawn, because considered harsh by General Halleck.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: From my recent interview with the President and yourself, and from the President's letter of this morning, which you delivered to me at your reception, I am led to believe that there is a very important difference of opinion in regard to my relations toward generals commanding armies in the field, and that I cannot perform the duties of my
