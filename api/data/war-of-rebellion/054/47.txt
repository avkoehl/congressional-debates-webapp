HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 26, 1863-4.30 p.m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Stevenson:

The letter of General Wood forms no part of your instructions. It was simply sent as information from an officer who had passed over the road, and to be thrown with what other information you can gain from other sources.

Your instructions are contained in two telegrams from these headquarters-one of October 24,2.30 p.m., and the other the telegram of this morning, directing the movement to commence to-morrow morning. Answer.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
