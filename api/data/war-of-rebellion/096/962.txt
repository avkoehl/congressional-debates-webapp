CITY POINT, March 14, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

I am in receipt of dispatches from Sherman of the 8th and Schofield of the 12th. Sherman was at Laurel Hill, and said that he would reach Fayetteville on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. He found abundance of supplies, and wanted nothing but sugar, coffee, and hard bread. He says, "We are all well, and have done finely." Schofield says that Bragg was fairly beaten in the battle of the 10th, and retired during the night behind the Neuse River.

U. S. GRANT,

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE:

From this time forward keep your command in condition to be moved on the very shortest possible notice in case the enemy should evacuate, or partially evacuate, Petersburg, taking with you the maximum amount of supplies your trains are capable of carrying. It will not be necessary to keep wagons loaded, as they can be loaded in a few hours at any time. If we do move the line southwest of the Jones house will be abandoned.
