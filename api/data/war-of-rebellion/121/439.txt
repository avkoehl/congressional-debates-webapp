May I request, general, that you will give the necessary orders to insure that the instructions which have been given in relation to reporting prisoners of war may be fully carried out.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I again call your attention to the case of Colonel John H. Winston, a Confederate officer, who has been sentenced to ten years' imprisonment at Alton with hard labor and ball and chain.
