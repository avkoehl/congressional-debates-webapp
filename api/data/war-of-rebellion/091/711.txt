Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

HARPER'S FERRY, November 30, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The camp of the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry was attacked last night about 12 o'clock. The attacking force are a part of a Virginia regiment acting with Mosby and camped on this side the mountains. They were finally repulsed, but killed 2 of our men, wounded 1, and captured 5, also 19 horses. The enemy lost 1 killed and several wounded. The force at the camp is only a camp guard of forty men. Anticipating that the attack would be made, I directed the commanding officer to call on Heine's infantry for assistance. He did so, but they sent him no help. Will your order him to send 100 men of his command to the camp until the regiment returns. I cannot send any force from this point at present. They will not be wanted longer than twenty-four hours.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Colonel Heine cannot well spare any men, as I want the railroad kept open, and he has the most important point on the road. You can, if you think it necessary, call on the commanding officer at Opequon crossing for 200 men.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
