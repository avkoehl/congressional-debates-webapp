fair in war. We are in great need of ambulance wagons; could it be possible to furnish the army with about 50 more? While in Maryland we were unable to procure medical supplies to any amount. I received your communication relative to purchasing such articles as we need if opportunity should offer, and will have your orders executed. Up to this time but few reports of sick and wounded have been sent in, the surgeons being unable to make them out, owing to the continued march to which the army has been subjected since leaving Richmond, and their time being also much occupied in caring for the wounded in the late battles. There are about 5,000 sick and wounded still at Winchester, who are being removed to Staunton in ambulance wagons that should be with the marching army. I am greatly obliged to you for relieving me from the care and responsibility of hospitals left in the rear of the army. I sincerely hope that Medical Director Williams, or some competent under him, will be ordered to Winchester to superintend the removal of these disabled soldiers, their position being an unsafe one in the event of a movement of the army. If our army leaves here, they may be paroled by the enemy's cavalry.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. GUILD,

Surgeon and Medical Director Army of Northern Virginia.
