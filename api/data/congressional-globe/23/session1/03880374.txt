would present a plan upon that subject at the next
session of Congress
Mr BARRÍ NGER expressed himself in favor
of tnis amendment in strong terms
Mr PARKER said, this lim tation wouid ex-
tend only to a very few  of the most important and
respoiisib'e oncers, and would not touch the great
mass of custom house officers 1 here was a strong
necessity for a revision of the system of compen
eation The emoluments of these ofrcers should
be such rs to command the se vices of men of
responsibility and high character lie considered
this proposition as totally inadequa'c
Mr   G1LLET thojght the proposed amend
merit out of place in the bill, v hich did not refer
to the "or"iensation of these oncers, in any nan
nei wh itevu
Mr VINTON was satisfied that lim tations end
lestrictions shou'd be placed upon the bi'l The
expenditures of the last year h d greatly exceeded
the e"tnnntes

eéis of customs, caie should be taken that it be
not fixed so low as gradually to introduce a sys
lem of fiauds upon the .evenuc, as in some coun
tries in Europe
Mr HATtrEIt, of Pennsylvania, went into a
detailed statement relative to the unnecessary offi
eeis attached to the custom nouses, and the exoi
bitsnt compensation they leccived
Mi HARPER, of New Hampshire, was satis
fied tint i synen foi regulating the ome is of
customhouses should be adopted, bu'believing

I     Mi  GRUNDY olneoted to the aloption of the
I resolution      Tne Pos1 Ornee Committee, of which
I he was chanman, weie engaged in a most labo
nous and  extensive investigation, and the time
i now affoided them was scarcely sufficient for the
puipose, and if they were compelled to meet in
session at eleven, it would be impossible for them
to do what was necessary, or expected of them by
j the S nate
1 ~>Tr TIPTON'S object was to facilitate busi
ness, and he thought most of the business now to
be ac ed on was in the form of bids, but he had
no objection that the resolution should be laid on
the tibie
|     On n otio-1 of Mi   E WING, the resolution was
I lai 1 on the lab'e
I The resol ttion settm°- apart Tndaysand Satur
days dining the i trmi der of the session for the
conndeiation of private bills exclusively, was
taken no foi consideration   and after some convei
, sation between Mi   WCUSTER and Mi   HEN
1 DRICKS, it was adopted
| Tne rebolution of Mr EWIJNG, calling for in-
formation fiom the State Department, with regard
I to tne Superintendent of the Patent Office, was
I taken up and adopted
The Senate then  proceeded to consider the bill
sufhoii¿ing the people of Michigan Termoiy to j
torn a -'|   r t " S >te go'einment
Mi  FWING mov d to 'uj tl e bid on the tu1 le,
as the Senate was thin, and the subject was im-
portant
Mi TIPTON urged its consideration without
delay, ard asked the yeas and nays on the motion,
which were ordeied, and are as follows, to wit
YEAS—Messis Brown, Calhoun, Clayton,
E amg, FiUinghuysen, Knight,Najdain, Portei,
Prentiss, Robbms, Silsbee, femith, Southard, and

ton, Toml nson, Webstei, White, Wilkms, aid
Wtight—20
So the motion was dec ded in the negative, and
the bill, and also an amendment submitted as a
substitute for the whole bill, were then consideied
Mr TIPTON said he would not disguise tie
fact, that he felt moie than an ordinary soliutuue
foi thepassage of the bills peimitung the people of
Michigan and Aikansns Territory to form consti
tutions, and foi tl eir admission into the Union of
the States His anxie y v as increased by having
had charge of then applications from an e£>rly
day in tne session.
It wou'd be recollected by the Serate that he
mticJuced bil's for then admission, some ra mths
ago These bills wereiefeired to a select com-
mittee, of which he had the horor to be chan
man The comrai tee was divided m opinion, and
the sibject was suspended by urcumbtsi ces be
yond Ins control, fot months, and finally a ma-
jor ty of tne committee instructed him to ieportan
amendment to stnke out the bill from the enacting
clause, and mseitpn amendment authorizing f>e
taking oe the census The census thus taken is
to be laid before Congress at its next session
This amet dment, d adopted, we uld be di'atory
in its effects, and would postpone the decision
one year I o this he hoped the Senate would i ot
give its sanction He had prepared an amend
ment authorizing the taking of the census by the
United States marshals for each Territory, and if
there are 47,700 inhabitants, fede-al riumbei , in
both or either Terntoty, the Governoi is to 1 ty
off distr cts, and ordei an election of delegates to
fo-m a constitu ion What could be said in favor
of one of these lemtories might as truly be said
of the other, and hu, amend ment, if adopted, placed
the adn ission of both on equal grounds, depend
ing on the ontingency of each Terntoiy hivi g
47,700 inhabitan s, the simé" population t! at en
titles a like number to aRepiesentativem Congress
from the othei States He was at a loss to see
how the S nate could reject a proj ( sinon, in itself
I sojist Theoijinance of July, 1787, for thegoi-
I ernment of the terntoiy northwest of the Ohio
rivei, may be called the foundation of good gov
ernment in that conntiy This ordinance pi ovides
the means of education, regulates the descent of
I pioperty, and holds out inducemen's to joung
men to emigrate to the West Article five pio
udes that the northwest territory shall be divided
into not less than three, noi moieJian fue S i e«,

and to form one or two ¡stiles north of an eastn d

Lake Michigrn And whenever any of thesud
States shall have 60,000 inhabitants, it shall be
admitted into the Union on an equal footing w uh
the original States in all respects whatever The
same ordinance also goes on to say, that so fn as
it may be consistent with the general interest of
this Confederacy, States may be admitted at an
earlier period,and with less number, thar f>0 000
