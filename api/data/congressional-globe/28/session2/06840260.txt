APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 1846.
28th Cong 2d Sess.
Rhode Island Controversy—Mr. Elmer.
~H. of Reps.
t of our fellow-citizens, and call yearly for the
expenditure of millions from the public treasury.
From Norfolk around by the Gulf of Florida to the
south of the Sabine, a distance of 2,000 miles, the
first dollar has yet to be expended in building a ship
for the navy."
Finally^ the foundry would be in tha* part of the
Union which has been least favored by disbursements
from the public treasury.
It will readily be conceded that these disburse-
ments or appropriations should be justly and equi-
tably distributed throughout the whole country; but
upon what principle is it that Georgia—the largest
but one of the Atlantic States—has received for in-
ternal improvements, from the commencement of
the government to the present time, only $122,958 68,
whilst Delaware, the smallest but one of the Atlantic
States, has received $1,443,968 15?
If not according to size, were the amounts dis-
tributed according to population? Georgia contains,
by the last census,' 691,392 inhabitants—Delaware
78,085. Or were the amounts distributed according
to the commercial importance of the States? The
total amount of domestic and foreign commerce of
Georgia, as the report of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury shows, is §4,529,401—that of Delaware, $98,-
682. And even if you add to that of Delaware the
amount of domestic and foreign commerce of Penn-
sylvania, (which is only 2,354,948,) that of Georgia
"will nearly double them both.
The expenditures of the government in internal
improvements, from 1799 to 1811, inclusive, did not
exceed $426,000; and during the last session bills
passed Congress making appropriations, in a single
branch of internal improvement, viz: that of harbors
and rivers, of upwards of a million of dollars; at
the present session, in the same branch, of nearly
two millions, and so it has constantly been since
1824—that year when the rage for internal improve-
ment by the general government commenced.
And how have these immense sums been applied?
Upon what principle distributed? What portion of
the amount has been expended at the South? By a
statement (see appendix 2) which I have before me,
obtained from the Treasury Department, showing
the amount which each State has ever received from
the general government for fortifications, light-
houses, public debt, pensions, and internal improve-
ments, it appears that (leaving out, as neutral
ground, the District of Columbia) there has been
expended in internal improvements, in the eleven
States north of the Potomac, $4,970,458 27, and in
the ten States south of it only §1,829,973 45; be-
ing less than one-fourth of the amount spent at the
South that there has been expended at the North.
Shall we be told, in advocating our rights to a
fust and equal share of these disbursements from
the public treasury, that it is narrow-minded, self-
ish, and unpatriotic, to advancc our claims upon
the narrow limits of sectional grounds f We take
our stand on higher grounds; our patriotism is
not bounded, nor can it be hemmed in, within the
narrow limits of the neglected South. "No pent-up
Utica contracts our powers, but (in patriotism) the
■whole boundless continent is ours." Is not the
South a part of country? And shall not every part
be defended? Is it not essential to the comparatively
well-fortified North that the South, too, should be
defended? No: all that we claim for the South is
demanded alike by the national interests, the neces-
sities, the welfare, and the safety of the whole
country.
But to return to the amendment.
If, then, we are convinced of our necessity for
ordnance, and that the proper mode of obtaining a
supply is by the establishment of government
foundries, that those foundries would be most judi-
ciously located, one at the North and the other at
the South, why should not this amendment prevail?
Is the amount asked for too much? $100,000 from
our overflowing treasury? about one-fourth the
sum recently voted to the improvement of a single
river. Or is it that the subject is not of sufficient
importance? Not of sufficient importance to pre-
serve the lives of those who fight our battles for us?
Not of sufficient importance to preserve the honor
of our flag, and the liberties of our people?
And how can these objects be attained without
tha possession of proper weapons? It is not for the
slight advantages to the section of the country in
which I live, and which may be benefited by the
location of such an institution in their midst, that I
seek the adoption of the measure; no, far from it; it
is for the sake of our galliant soldiers and sailors—it
js for the safety and the glory of our country—that
I demand it. Our soldiers are ready to meet the
veteral legions from Waterloo; our sailors ?ire ready
to encounter her whose boasted
"March is on the mountain wave,
Whose home is on the deep."
And all they ask is for proper weapons; all they
seek is to be equally armed. A slighter boon they
could not ask; a slighter boon we could not grant. 1
trust the committee will receive the amendment, that
thus, whilst engaged in retrenchmentf they will adopt
a measure calculated for the saving, not of money,
but of men; and whilst their object is reform, they
will discard a practice degrading to the age and
country in which we live, and adopt a course
pointed out by reason, called for by humanity, and
demanded by the highest and best interests of the
country.

SPEECH OF MR. ELMER,
OF NEW JERSEY.
In ihe House of Representatives February 28, 1845.—
On the Rhode Island controversy.
The subject came before the House of Represent-
atives, upon the question of agreeing to certain res-
olutions reported at the last session by a select com-
mittee ups,- tne memorial of the democratic mem-
bers *) the legislature of Rhode Island. These
resolutions were accompanied by an elaborate re-
port o the majority of the committee in support of
them, counter report of the minority, and by nu-
merous documents. They were postponed at the
time fcvey were presented (June 7, 1844) for final
action at this session, and are as follows:
1. Resolved, That all freemen, when they form the social
compact, are equal; and that no men, or set of men, are en-
titled to exclusive, separate, public emolument or privi-
leges from the community.
•i. l?/>solved, That all power is inherent in the people, and
all free governments arc founded on their authority, and
instituted for their peace, safety, and happiness, and for
thes>e ends they have at all times an inalienable and inde-
feasible right to alter, refoim. or abolish their government
in such manner as they may think proper
3. Resolved, That the sovereign power of the State of
Rhode Island is inherent in the people thereof; and'that
they have at all times the inalienable and indefeasible right
to alter, reform, or abolish their government in such man-
ner as they may think proper; and that any constitution or
frame of government, republican in'its form, adopted by
them, is entitled to the guaranty of the United States, until
abrogated by an act ot said people, as solemn and authentic
as that by which it was adopted.
4 Resolved. That the constitution adopted in December,
1841, by the people of Rhode Island, is republican in its
form, and was rightfully adopted ?>y a majority of said peo-
ple, anJ, as such, was entitled to the guaranty of the United
States, until it was virtually surrendered by the assent of
said people to the existing constitution of said State, as in-
dicated by the act of registering their names, and voting in
the first general election under said last mentioned consti-
tution.
5. Resolved, That the government established under the
constitution adopted by the people of Rhode Inland >.-f De-
cember, 1S41, and duly organized according to its pro 
visions, was, until the said constitution was surrendered by
the assent of the > people to the existing constitution, the
legitimate constitutional government of s?jd State: and that
all acts, laws, and proceedings of said government, under
said constitution ol 1841, and m accordance therewith, and
the records thereof, are entitled to full faith and credit in all
the other States of the Union, and in the courts of the United
States
6. Hesoh ed, That the interference by the President of the
United States with the military power of the Union, on the
side of the late charter government of Rhode Island, against
the constitution adopted in 1841, and by which the same was
suppressed, vtas unauthorized by the constitution and laws
of the United State*;, and m derogation of the rights of the
people of Rhode Island.
7. Resolrtd, That John Pittman. United States Judge ior
the district of Rhode Island, [and other United State- officers
who are named.j by personally inteifi*nng with arms in a
military capacity, m the late political contest oi the people
of Rhode Island, growing out of the attempt to establish a
constitution for said State, have been guilty of conduct un-
authorized by the constitution and laws of the United States,
of evil example, and tending to comproinit the government
of the United States in its relation': with the State of Rhode
Inland, and to produce forcible collision between the people
of said State and the authorities of the United States, at the
imminent ha'/ard of involving the whole Union-in the ca-
lamities and horrors of civil v. nr.
These resolutions being read, and the question
stated to be on their adoption, Mr. Elmer spoke in
substance as follows:
Mr. Speaker: The question upon these resolutions
has come upon us suddenly and unexpectedly, 8nd
at a time when I am laboring under serious indis-
position, and scarcely able to make myself heard;
but I cannot consent to let it pass without express-
ing my dissent from doctrines which i deem radi-
cally erroneous and of dangerous tendency, Thef
