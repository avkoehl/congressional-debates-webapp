THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
tiori by inserting after the word "occupancy," in
the seventh line, the words, " within the State of
Minnesota, and all;" and after the word " lands,"
in the seventh line, " and;" so that it will read:
And all lands and right? of occupancy within the State of
Minnesota, and all annuities and claims h^retofote accorded
to said Indians, or any of them, to he forfeited, &c\
Upon that subject I desire to say a word; and
I desire to address myself particularly to my friend
from New Hampshire, who has made the motion
to strike out everything in this section which looks
like a forfeiture of the Indian reservations, lwiil
say to my friend from New Hampshire that the
committee have had the facts laid before them, and,
indeed, the facts are so notorious, known to the
whole country, that they must have come to the
notice of every Senator, so that there can be no
doubt that the provision which forfeits their right
to reservations in the State of Minnesota is just
and proper.
If you look on the map of Minnesota you will
find that the Minnesota river is a navigablestream,
running first southwest from St. Paul and then
northwest from the big bend of the St. Peters, as
it is called. Upon the south bank of that river,
a strip about ten miles wide and neaily one hun-
dred miles long, is this reservation, and the white
population are settled all around it, north of it,
west of it. It runs in a northwestei ly direction.
It was the outbreak of the bands of the Indians on
the reservation, as well as parts of bands that came
from the plains, that carried such a desolating In-
dian war over the western borders of Minnesota,
as is entirely unparalleled in the history of the
United States. In the whole history of our colo-
nization, in New England, New York, Pennsyl-
vania, anywhere, there is nothing of which we can
read that bears any compauson with the real facts
as to this Indian massacre m Minnesota. Five
hundred persons at least, for the names of them
have been received, and probably eight hundred
persons have been slaughtered, massacred by these
Indians; their women taken off captive and rav-
ished tinder circumstances of brutality that makes
the blood run cold as you read the facts. Their
children have been massacred; some of them have
actually been nailed up and crucified, and found
in that condition by men who entered into some
of these dwellings. And, sir, if ever there was a
time when a people had a right to feel outraged by
a massacre committed by Indians, it is the people
of Minnesota, and I can sympathize very deeply
tn the feelings of my honoiablc friend from Min-
nesota when he says that the state of feeling of
the people Â«f Minnesota is such that they cannot
endme these reservations, right in their midst, of
these hostile Indians, and we may as well now
declare that their right to this reservation is for-
feited, as at any other time.
At the same time, I will agiec with my honor-
able friend from New Hampshire, who said, in
leading the geneial language of the section, that
it seejned to be too broad; it seemed to forfeit then-
rights of occupancy anywhere withm the United
States,so that they could not live anywhere. Some
of them ought not to live anywhere; but they have
women and children who, perhaps, have still the
right to live; and the general broad declaration of
forfeiting all rights of occupancy anywhere, which
may belong, under our theory of dealing with the
Indians, to the Sioux upon the plains, is going
too tai; but with the amendment which is now
offered, it confines it to the fuifeiture of ihen res-
ervation in Minnesota, which is just in the shape
to which I have called your attention, being a
narrow piece of ground upon the Minnesota river,
a navigable stream, and right in the heart of the
State, surrounded by white people. I think we
may just as well declare now that their right to
that reservation is forfeited, and then when the
bill comes up which provides the mode for re-
moving and disposingofthese Indians,and forthe
sale of this reservation to raise the means to pro-
vide for their removal, that whole subject will come
before the Senate. I hope, therefore, that the
amendment which I now offer will prevail, and
that when it prevails, my friend from NewHamp-
fihn e will be satisfied with the section as it will
then stand amended.

on the amendment of the Senator from Wiscon-

curs on the amendment of the Senator from New

it; I withdraw the amendment.
