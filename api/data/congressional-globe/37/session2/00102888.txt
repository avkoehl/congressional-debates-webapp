THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 23,
would not necessarily be referred to the relations
between supply and demand. I believe that this
hill wilt tend to inflate unduly,the currency which
isaiready very considerably inflated. It will tenu
to increase the mischief to which we are already
subjected rather than to diminish it.
We have appeared to go along very well under
the present arrangement, perhaps better than we
could have expected; but, Mr. Chairman, 1 fear
that our success is like the uncertain sign of re-
cover/which consumptive patients sometimes ex-
hibit before dissolution. Our success is a precur-
sor, I fear, of consequences which everygentleman
here does not anticipate. The condition of our
finances, at any rate, behooves us to be very care-
ful, otherwise wo may involve the country in a
financial crisis such as it has never before realized.
We must know that the financial condition of the
country at this time is not a healthy one, because
we are not producing as much as we consume; and
when wo are not doing that our financial condi-
tion is necessarily growing weak.
The great argument which will be urged in favor
of this bill is, that we have not sufficient currency
in circulation, which the Government can com-
mand with its bonds, to meet the wants of the Gov-
ernment; that the Government wants currency to
meet the present demands upon the Treasury, and
that this is the only way in which it can com-
mand it. I feel the force of this argument. But
I am persuaded that it would be far better for the
people of the country to sell bonds at a large dis-
count than to further disturb the relation between
price and value by a further issue of these notes.
Mr. EDWARDS. The question now is, I un-
derstand, upon the amendment proposed by the
gentleman from Rhode Island, [Mr. Sheffield.]
I am opposed to that amendment, in the first place,
for the reason which was so fatal to the amend-
ment proposed just now by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Stevens,] which seemed to
strike the House with alarm, and that was that
its effect would be to introduce another species of
Treasury notes. If that reason was a valid ob-
jection to that amendment, it is equally a valid
'objection to the amendment of the gentleman from
Rhode island, because if the amendment of the
gentleman prevails, we shall still have a third
species of Treasury notes in circulation, the third
differing fiom the second in that the second is val-
uable in every description of private business.
Mr. SHEFFIELD. If we have done wrong
before, let tis do right now.
Mr. EDWARDS. 1 am free, however, to say
that while this objection is as strong in opposition
to tli is amendment as to the amendment of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania, it is not one which has
very great weight with me. I am opposed to it
mainly for another reason, which is that it intro-
duces one kind of currency for the Government
and another for the people. That is an objection
which has been made use of with great force in
former times, when the currency of the Govern-
ment was hard money and the currency of the
people paper. I think this proposition to make
one description of currency for the Government
and another for the people is an equally offensive
discrimination. If it is good enough for the Gov-
ernment it is good enough for the people them-
selves. I know nothing about the Government
except as the mere agency to do the business of
the people of the whole country in the best way
possible for their interest.
Then again, how could the Government use
these notes if the amendment of the gentleman
from Rhode Island prevails? Would they pay
one class of creditors with the kind of notes which
cannot be brought into general use, and another
class of creditors with another kind of notes which
circulate everywhere in the community?
But, sir, passing from this amendmentl under-
stand the gentleman from Rhode Island to urge a
constitutional objection to this whole bill. Sir,I
think it is too late to argue that constitutional
question in connection with this subject. This
House have already passed, by a large majority,
in favor of the constitutionality of the measure,
overruling the objections which have been urged
in that regard. If the only objection to the issue
of these notes is that, in the opinion of some of the
members of the House, it is liable to a constitu-
tutional objection, it is sufficient to answer that
that question has once been settled here, and itis
hardly to be supposed that, tip'on a review, the
opinion of the House will be changed from any
new light that has now been presented to it.
But, sir, the great question to be determined in
considering this bill, the question passing in mo-
ment all others, passing even that of constitution-
ality, is, do the wants of the Government require
the issue of this additional amountof ยง150,000,000
legal tender notes. And here lot me say that 1
would have been glad if the necessity had not
arisen, I would be glad if the necessity did not
exist. Like every other member, no doubt, I have
felt extremely reluctant to respond to this new
call which is now made for so large an increased
issue of evidences of indebtedness of the Govern-
ment. It may be answered that it is not at the
option of the Government whether it will increase
its indebtedness or not. It has been demonstrated
that while the receipts from imports are, at most,
but some two hundred thousand dollars per day,
and we are in receipt of no other revenue from any
source, we are expending $1,000,000 per day.
Then is it not apparent, is it not obvious to every
member of the House that the Government is
compelled to increase its indebtedness, and that
the only question is in what form that indebted-
ness shall stand ? The only question is what kind
of evidence shall be furnished to the people who
supply the wants of the Government, and who
furnish it with means?
This again brings up the question which was
formerly discussed, whether the evidence of that
indebtedness shall be Treasury notes or bonds;
or whether it shall promise to pay in the form of
notes bearing no interest or in the form of bonds
bearing interest. If I were discussing that ques-
tion at length, I would not then permit the consti-
tutional question to be raised, I would regard it
as a mere matter of policy and expediency. That,
in my judgment, is the only aspect in which it can
properly be presented to the House. The prop-
ositions before the House are, the sale of bonds
bearing interest to the extent of $100,000,000, or
issue of notes to the extent of $150,000,000. I
would gladly give my consent to the amendment
proposing the sale of bonds of the Government if
1 were assured those bonds could be sold at par.
If we could realize money on the sale of these
bonds at par to a sufficient extent to meet the
wants of the Government, we should be saved the
necessity of the issue of these additionalTreasury
notes at this time. They might be issued at some
future time if it should become necessary. But
my judgment is, and 1 think the judgment of this
House is, that $100,000,000 of these six per cent,
bonds could not be negotiated at this time at par.
The effect of offering so large a sum upon the
market would bo not only to depreciate them, but
to drag down all other securities of the Govern-
ment held in private hands. If that be true, to me
it is an unanswerable objection.
I go, therefore, for the issue of notes at this time,
and why? Because if we desire to place the indebt-
edness of the Government in the shape of bonds
it can be done more successfully in the future by
a gradual conversion of the notes into bonds than
by offering so large an amount upon the market
directly.
It is said that these notes have not been absorbed
by the bonds as rapidly as was expected. I admit
the fact. I admit that the amount of notes which
have been funded is small, but this is accounted
for in the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury
himself in the fact that our demand notes were re-
ceivable for duties and were held back for the pay-
ment of the duties which may arise on imports as
they shall come in, and for that purpose they com-
mand a premium of two or three per cent, over the
legal tender notes. It is accounted for, too, in the
fact that the community requtresso large an amount
for circulation that when you take into consider-
ation the demand notes which have been with-
drawn from circulation to the extent of near sixty
million dollars, but little of the $90,000,000 re-
maining can be withdrawn from circulation for
funding in the six percent, bonds. Thataloncis
sufficient to account for the small amount of these
bonds which have been taken. But if you author-
ize the further issue of $150,000,000 Treasury
notes, or so much thereof as the Government may
require to meetits necessities, it will furnish more
than is required for the circulation of the country.
Large amounts of it will be hold by capitalists and
they will fund it in these six pei cent, bonds of
theGovernment. Hence, I shall cxpect when this
new issue of notes comes into circulation, instead
of their being funded in mere driblets as  hey have
been in the past wo shall find them being rapidly
converted into bonds, for the reason that they will
accumulate in the hands of capitalists, there being
an excess over the requirements of the country for
circulation. . ,
The question then for us to decide is whethei
this amount of #150,000,000 is too large. That
is the only point upon which I hesitate at all. it
the Government requires these additional means
we have got to furnish them, and it seems to me it is
altogether unprofitable for gentlemen to get up
here and treat this question as if it were at oui
option whether we should furnish theGovernment
with the means it is decided it requires, or not.
The interests of the country demand, nay, they
imperatively require that we shall vote means suf-
ficient to meet the exigences of the case as they
arise. . ...
I repeat, then, the only question with me is
whether this amount of $150,000,000 is not too
large, whether a less amount would not answer.
My first impression was that$100,000,000 was all
that would be asked for. I agree with the gentle-
man who has preceded me that after having fixed
the amount asked at $100,000,000, it was unfortu-
nate that in demanding an additional jp5u,0U0,UUU
the Secretary of the Treasury gave us no reason
why this additional amount was required.
But, Mr. Chairman, there is something which
justifies this $150,000,000, and which justifies our
investing the Secretary of the Treasury with dis-
cretion to issue these notes in order to atijust the
indebtedness of the country as fast as possible.
He has accounted for $100,000,000, and let gen-
tlemen take notice that there is something like
.000,000 of outstanding certificates of mdebt-
ncss issued by the Government. They are to be
met, and when are they to be met? Gentlemen
may say they do not become payable under eight,
ten, or twelve months. Still they are the debts
of the Government, and they have to be met one
way or the other. There is no probability that
we will be in a better position to meet them in
eight, ten, or twelve months than we are now.
There is no probability that we will derive suf-
ficient from the known revenues of the country
to meet them or the other indebtedness of the
country. We have to meet them, then, as other
debtors meet their debts in time of embarrassment.
We have to change liabilities, and this additional
|50,000,000 maybe required, if we have no other
means, to take up those certificates of indebtedness
within twelve months. I do not say that we must
wait until they become due before we give the
Secretary of the Treasury the power in some bill
by which, in his discretion, those certificates of
indebtedness may be canceled. I say that that
is too narrow a view of the matter. I say, if that
indebtedness has to be met, it is best for us now
to give the Secretary of the Treasury these means,
which are to be used at his discretion, so that he
may shape the indebtedness of the Government
from time to time, and the means for meeting that
indebtedness, so that the latter will not outstrip
the former, or that at any time there will be a fail-
ure on the part of the Government to meet any of
its just obligations.
That is all I intended to say. I did not rise for โข
the purpose of going into' an elaborate argument
on the principles which govern this matter. I
have endeavored to take a practical view of it, to
see whether it is safe and proper for the House to
place in the hands of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury the amount of means which he suggests. I
do not see any objection to it. It is to be issued
to be used for a temporary purpose. These notes
are for the Government. They are to remain in
the Treasury. They are not indebtedness any-
where until used. If the exercise of the power
to issue shall become necessary, we trust the Gov-
ernment will decide wisely as to the extent to
which it shall be used, and exercise it only to the
extent which shall be unavoidable. In times like
these we must trust power somewhere, and when
we shall come to the conclusion that we can only
be safe from its abuse by withholding it, our ex-
trication from the difficulties and perils that sur-
round us will be hopeless indeed.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I wish to make a single re-
mark in reply to the gentleman from Rhode Isl-
and, who took exception to my declaration that
none of these banks redeemed the notes which
