Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Will you authorize citizens to enlist for the immediate defense of Baltimore and Washington, to remain in service only during such emergency? It is believed that only thus can prompt and large aid be assured.

ALEX. HENRY,

Mayor.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

We are doing all we can to protect the road between here and Wilmington. If you could send one of the militia batteries, or even a section, to report to Major Judd, at Wilmington, Del., it would be of great service.
