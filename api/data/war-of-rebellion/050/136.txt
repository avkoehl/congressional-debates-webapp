General GARFIELD:

Wagner reports heavy columns of cavalry at Missionary Mills. I have sent to General Thomas' headquarters for Minty to push his whole command, except one battalion, to Missionary Mills and secure our train from destruction. Spears crossed at Battle Creek this morning. I suppose you received my message transmitted at 8 p.m.

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

We have just concluded a terrific day's fighting, and have another in prospect for to-morrow. The enemy attempted to turn our left, but his design was anticipated, and a sufficient force placed there to render his attempt abortive. The battle-ground was densely wooded and its surface irregular and difficult. We could make but little use of our artillery. The number of our killed is inconsiderable; that of our wounded very heavy. The enemy was greatly our superior in numbers. Among our prisoners are men from some third regiments. We have taken 10 cannon and lost 7. The army is in excellent condition and spirits, and, by the blessing of Providence, the defeat of the enemy will be total to-morrow.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Have captured 10 pieces of artillery. Took prisoners from thirty different regiments, and with the blessing of God will do more to-morrow.

General BURNSIDE:

Joe Johnson is with Bragg with large portion of his force, and re-enforcements have arrived from Virginia. We need all we can concentrate to oppose them. Let me hear from you.

ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
