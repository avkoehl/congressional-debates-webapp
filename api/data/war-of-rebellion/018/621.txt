troops forward as fast as they arrive. General Reynolds is now in communication with ReNumbers Reports all quiet at Barnett's Ford. There is no considerable force in our front. The horses of some of the batteries have not arrived, and they will not be able to move until to-morrow. Our transportation is limited, and I think supplies should be pushed out from Alexandria.

Major-General HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief:

I think more troops besides Heintzelman's corps should go to Alexandria. If you agree with me, shall I use my discretion about sending them?

Major-General HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief:

If there are teams with Pope for Tyler's heavy guns, which I sent up to Alexandria yesterday, would it not be well to send the guns out to him by railroad? There is no force in our front, and I will keep the command here at the minimum.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Falmouth, Va., August 22, 1862.

Major General GEORGE W. MORELL,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: In compliance with special instructions from Major-General Burnside, you have been ordered to move to-day to the vicinity of Barnett's Ford, on the Rappahannock, the portion of your division now here. The batteries will follow you as soon as possible. The troops near you, and which you have to control, support, or be united with, are located as follows:

At Richards' Ford a small party of cavalry watching the ford. The ford is difficult, and the road connecting with the main road is blocked for a few miles.

At Barnett's Ford, an important crossing to be held, are Griffin's brigade, Sixth New York, and Brodhead's Michigan cavalry, and a section of artillery.

At Kelly's Ford are Reno's and Stevens' divisions, Reynolds' division supporting.

At Rappahannock Station, on Orange and Alexandria Railroad, is a portion of General Pope's army, his headquarters near Bealeton. Communication is or must be kept up by cavalry patrols.

By authority of General Burnside you will assume command of the cavalry in your vicinity, and give them orders to carry out these instructions, provided they do not interfere with special instructions from Major-General Pope in the case of the Brodhead cavalry.
