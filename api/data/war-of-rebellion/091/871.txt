is very evident that none of the troops in the department now can be removed without endangering the safety of the country, unless their place is supplied by others.

Hoping that these matters may receive early consideration at the hands of the department, I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A body of deserters and insurgents, under lead, it is alleged, of a Federal officer, are organized and operating in counties of Floyd and Franklin. The promptest possible measures should be taken to crush this movement in it incipiency. Governor Smith will write you fully on this subject.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, &c.:

GENERAL: I am preparing to send a small force, as large as I can possible spare from other points, into Northwestern Virginia, for the purpose of endeavoring to interrupt the communications of the enemy in that quarter, and to bring out as many beef-cattle and horses as possible. The force will consist of between 500 and 600 men, well mounted, under a very energetic officer, and I hope that they will effect something of service to the Government. The expedition will leave the country of Monroe on or about the 20th instant. My information is that the enemy have now only small detachments scattered about in Northwestern Virginia. I will communicate with General Lee on the subject.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

JNO. ECHOLS,

Brigadier-General.
