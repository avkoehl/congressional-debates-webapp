prudent to move my whole command back to Fisher's Hill, the other side of Stransburg. I am expecting to hear from the river again this morning. Colonel Smith states that he has given up all hope of being able to cut the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, but will try to get out some supplies from Clarke County. I have sent you one or two couriers, but have heard nothing from them. I expect to hear from Colonel Smith this morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD L. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General.

MIDDLETOWN, January 3, 1864.

Major-General EARLY,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Scouts just in from Front Royal state that the estimated force of the enemy at that place last night was between 10,000 and 12,000, with six pieces of artillery. They remained there until about 12 o'clock this morning, when they moved off down the Wapping road and turned in toward Berry's Ferry. I have some scouts still on the other side of the river watching their movements.

Colonel Smith has just moved his command to this point; will picket the roads leading to this place, scouting up toward Winchester. My command is now at Strasburg. Colonel Smith thinks it useless to make any further efforts to get out supplies, &c., in this section. The enemy were reported moving from Martinsburg to Winchester in heavy force this morning. A small party were in Winchester.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD L. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General.

MIDDLETOWN, January 3, 1864.

Colonel SMITH, Commanding, &c.:

COLONEL: I have been unable to learn anything this morning as to the strength of the enemy at Front Royal. From what I can learn I think there is no doubt about a force being there. I consider it best to move my command back to Strasburg, so as to hold the roads leading into that place. You had better cover the roads coming to Middletown. I will have Captain Norwood, assistant adjutant-general, to confer with you in reference to this matter. I have sent a note to General Early this morning; I expect to hear from him soon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD L. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General.
