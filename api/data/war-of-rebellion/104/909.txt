SELMA, May 25, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel J. HOUGH, Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I have Governor Andrew B. Moore here in the guard house. While I was after Governor Moore, General McArthur arrested Mr. Gayle of Cahawba, the writer of the notice in the Selma Dispatch, also two workmen in the office of the Dispatch as witnesses against Gayle. Do you want them brought to Montgomery? It will, perhaps, be a day before a boat will leave here for Montgomery, and then it will be one of the slowest. You know I do not care to take the journey to Washington, unless the general directs it. There are officers to whom it would be a favor, and General McArthur would like Captain Wellman, of his staff to go if you have no one to send, and decide to forward the prisoners from here to Mobile.

HANSON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MACON, May 25, 1865.

Major WOODWARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The scout I sent to Memphis did not find any of the marauders. The infantry from Gainesville had arrested two of them. They found 700 sacks corn, 75 bales fodder, 320 bales cotton. Left a guard of fifteen men. Shall I press wagons to bring it here, or will it be taken out by river? There are thirteen buildings here filled with ordnance stores.
