Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The brigade commanders of this division have been requested to report as soon as they are ready to move, and the information will be sent to corps headquarters promptly.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: By direction of the lieutenant-general commanding I have the honor to inform him that my headquarters for to-night are on the open ground near the frame hospital which I pointed out to him this afternoon.

I respectfully suggest that I have received no orders except verbally from you this morning to move my command to Chattanooga, and that I have found my brigades moving under other orders, which is may apology for their scattered condition. I have officers in search of them, and will report their exact locality as soon as possible.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General, Commanding.
