Honorable C. B. SEDGWICK,

House of Representatives, Washington.

SIR: In reply to your inquity of what number of prisoners were surrendered to our forces at Fort Donelson, Tenn., I have respectfully to inform you that the official report of General Grant on that head is in these words:

I am pleased to announce to you the unconditional surrender this morning of Fort Donelson with 12,000 to 15,000 prisoners, at least 40 pieces of artillery and a large amount of stores, horses, mules and other public property.

No further report on the subject has been received.

I am, sir, &c.,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

FRANKFORT, KY., March 28, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Saint Louis, Mo.

SIR: I take the liberty of suggesting for your consideration to retain in confinement the prisoners from Kentucky taken at the surrender of Fort Donelson. There is a strong secession feeling scattered throughout the State, and when one of the released prisoners returns home his friends lionize him and it tends to embolden the secessionists.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

JAMES HARLAN,

U. S. District Attorney for Kentucky.

LEBANON, MO., March 28, 1862.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding Army of the Southwest.
