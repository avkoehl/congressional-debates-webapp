This was but a feebl" description of the servile
wars, where the slaves were of the same color as

of Mr Adams m aliHS on to Mr. Van Buren as
"tl e Northern man with Southern principles," and
took the occa ion to say that he was the author of
that s n ltnent, it having been given by him as a
toast at a fourth of July celebration

when
The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman that
h° was takmg a very wide íange, and wandering
from the immediate subject before the House,
Mr INGERSOLL said that, with all due defe-
rence to the opinion of the Chair, he regarded the
coursp of argument he was pursumg as necessary
to show the eflect of interfering with the question of
the abolition ot slavery
Mr ADAMS entreated that the gentleman from
Pean ylvan a might not be arrested in his speech
Mr I\OERSOLL said he da med not the floor
as i inMt i o  p iw'esie, but of right.
The SPEAI5XR thea said that the question of
the aim xalion of T"xas was not in crder at this
time The «er'ieman, h wver, was at liberty to
p oceed with hi°  e-nsrks m order.
