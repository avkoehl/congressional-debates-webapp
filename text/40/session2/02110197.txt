Oitioe Skcrctary of tiiu Senate,
April 30,1868.
I certifv thai the foregoing statement is correct as
appeals by tho records of the Senate.
J. \\T. I'OllNlIY, Secretary.
Mr. CCJIU'JS. The Sergeant-at-Arrns will
now please call Walter S. G'ox.
Walter S. Cox sworn and examined.
By Mr. Curtis: #
Question. State what is your residence and
wliat id your profession ?
Answer. I reside in Georgetown, in this Dis-
trict. I am a lawyer by profession.
Question, llow long have you been in tho
practice of the law?
Answer. Some twenty years, I think.
Question. In this city?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. In what courts?
Answer. In the courts of this District and,
most of the time, in the Supreme Court of the
United States.
Question. Were you connected profession-
ally with tl\2 matter of General Thomas before
the criminal court of this District or before a
magistrate?'
Answer, I was.
Question. When and under what circum-
stances did your connection with that matter
begin ?
Answer. On Saturday, the 22d of,Febru-
ary 
Mr. Mauager BUTLER. Stop a moment,
please, if L heard the question correctly, the
inquiry put to the witness was, when and under
what circumstances did your connection with
the case of Thomas before the Supreme Court,
or the chief justice of the District, commence?
Mr. CUliTIS. That was the question in
substance.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. To that we must
object. It is impossible to see how the employ-
ment of Mr. Cox to defend Mr. Thomas can
have anything to do with this case. It stands
in this way: we put in that Mr. Thomas said
that if it had not been for the arrest he should
have taken the War Office by force as he had
threatened. The defense then produced the
warrant and affidavit and the record of his
acquittal. I do not propose to argue it; but
i ask the attention of the Senate to the ques-
tion whether the employment of Mr. Cox by
Mr. Thomas as counsel, the circumstances
under which he was employed, and the dec-
laration of Mr. Thomas to his counsel, can be
put in evidence under any rule, even the one
which the Senate has just, voted should not be
the governing rule of this body—the exception
to evidence as too trivial—if it were not legally
incompetent?
Mr. CURTIS. I understand the objection
to be that we cannot show that General Thomas
employed Mr. Cox as his counsel; that we can-
not show declarations made by Mr. Thomas to
Mr. Cox as his counsel. We do not propose to
prove either of those facts. If the gentleman
will wait long enough to see what we do pro-
pose to prove, he will see that that objection
is not applicable. [To the witness.] Will
you now state, sir, when, and by whom, and
under what circumstances you were employed
in that matter?
Mr. Mauager BUTLER. Stop one moment.
I object. The question is, when, and by whom,
and under what circumstances this gentleman
was employed? If he was employed by the
President that is worse than the other, in my
judgment, as a legal proposition. I desire that
the question be put in writing that we may
have a ruling upon it; or, to save time, if the
learned counsel will put in exactly what he
proposes to prove by this witness we can meet
the whole of it.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chief Justice
sees no objection to the question as an intro-
ductory question, but will submit it to the Sen-
ate if it is desired. [After a pause, to the wit-
ness.] You can answer the question.
Answer. On Saturday, the 22d of February,
a messenger called at my house with a carriage
and stated that Mr. Seward desired to see mo
immediately——
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I object to the
declarations of any person there.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, (to the witness.)
You need not state anything that Mr. Seward
said to you.
The Witnjcks. Nothing was said by Mr.
Seward. The messenger stated further that
he was directed to take me immediately to the
President's House. I accompanied hjm to the
President's House and found the President and
General 'Thomas there alone.
By Mr. Curtis:
Question. At what hour or about what hour?
Answer. At about five o'clock in the after-
noon. After I was seated the President
stated 
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Stop a moment,
I object to the statement of the President at
five o'clock in the afternoon. [Laughter.]
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Will the counsel
for the President state the object of this tes-
timony ?
