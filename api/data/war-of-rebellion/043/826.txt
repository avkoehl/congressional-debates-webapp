Corps. The Second Brigade (Kane`s) extended from the right of Greene`s brigade at an angle of about 45 degrees forward, conforming its line to the crest of the ridge. The First Brigade (Candy`s) was formed in rear of the Third in line of battalions, in double column, as a support to the other two brigades. Breastworks were immediately thrown up along our entire line, unusual facilities being afforded by the wood and rock and nature of the soil. Skirmishers were thrown out to the creek, where they encountered the enemy`s pickets. I ordered the Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers forward as a support to the skirmishers of the Third Brigade. They deployed in a heavy line in rear of the advance skirmishers, and remained until withdrawn in the evening. At 4 p. m. the enemy opened with a fierce attack on the left and center of the army, and subjected our men to severe artillery fire. Finding that a battery of the enemy posted on a hill across Rock Creek was enfilading the lines of the First and* Eleventh Corps, I ordered a section of Knap`s (Pennsylvania) battery and one of Battery K, Fifth U. S. Artillery, to take position on the eminence at the left of Greene`s brigade and to silence the enemy`s battery. This they did after a hot artillery duel of about thirty minutes. The guns of these two sections were admirably served in the midst of a deadly fire from a battery which raked at short range the point they occupied. Occasional picket firing was kept up until 6 p. m. By a staff officer of Major-General Slocum, at 7 p. m. I received orders to move the division by the right flank, and follow the First Division, leaving one brigade to occupy the line of works of the entire corps. The First Division had gone nearly half an hour previously. Leaving Greene`s brigade in the entrenchments, I rapidly moved the First and Second Brigades to the right, across Rock Creek, and, having reached the turnpike across Rock Creek Bridge, halted and reported my position, through an aide, to corps headquarters. When ordered thus to leave my entrenchments, I received no specific instructions as to the object of the move, the direction to be taken, or the point to be reached, beyond the order to move by the right flank and to follow the First Division. The First Division having gone out of sight or hearing, I directed the head of my column by the course of some of the men of that division who appeared to be following it. While moving in this direction, the enemy`s artillery fire crossed our route, causing a few casualties among my troops. At 7. 30 o`clock I received an order to hold the position down to the creek at all hazards. I therefore formed my line, with my right resting on the turnpike, near the bridge, and my left on Rock Creek. In the meantime General Greene had commenced to extend his brigade, as ordered, along the line of entrenchments, and had barely occupied General Kane`s original position when a vigorous attack was made upon his front and right by the enemy, who quickly occupied the entrenchments left by the First Division. To meet this attack on his flank, the One hundred and thirty-seventh New York Volunteers, which held the right of Greene`s brigade, changed front, forming at a right angle to the rifle-pits, thus covering the right of the entire brigade. At this time the California Regiment, Colonel Smith, of Cutler`s brigade, Wadsworth`s division, First Corps, * reported as reinforcements. General Greene placed this regiment on the right of the One hundred and thirty-seventh. It soon fell back and was with-
