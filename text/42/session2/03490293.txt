Two facts assert themselves:
First, foreign capitalists find this country
the best field in the world in which to invest
surplus capital. This first fact is only ten
years old. Ex-Corn missioned Wells showed
that in 1863 the United States -had substan-
tially a clean balance-sheet abroad. Our for-
eign indebtedness has grown up since. Mr.
Wells estimated American liabilities to for-
eigners in 1869, at $1,465,000,000. The sum
has since increased. Last January, accord-
ing to the Economist, the London market ab-
sorbed over fifty million dollars of American
securities, as follows:
"NorthernPaeiiie railroad, £4.000,000; Grilman and
Clinton railroad, £400,000; Massachusetts five per
cent., £443,500; city of Washington loan, £800,000;
Baltimore and Potomac railroa.d, £640,000; city of
New York loan, £3,122,000; Atlantic and Great
Western railroad, £760,000; Cairo and Vincennes
railroad, £700,000; total, £10,865,500."
Here is another statement in illustration :
"The London Mining Journal gives the names.of
twenty-five mining claims on the Pacific coast which
are owned and operated by English companies—
seven in California, eight in Nevada, four in Utah,
and six in Colorado. The nominal capital of these
claims is $25,000,000. Several other claims have been
sold to English companies during the past year, rep-
resenting about $1,500,000 of nominal capital, and
Englishmen are now negotiating for more important
mines."
Probably the foreign capital now invested
in American securities amounts to $2,000,-
000,000.*
Secondly, those who invest these vast sums
have an interest to send wares to this country
for a part of the investment. That transac-
tion is not direct. For the securities exchange
is given, which is deposited with the London
bankers. British and continental merchants
crowd their goods into the United States and
sell them sometimes in sharp competition ; in
return they receive a part of the same Lon-
don exchange.
Because money is more needed here than
* These are the largest figures given by any au-
thority. Mr. Edward Young, of the Bureau of Sta-
tistics, places the aggregate at §>900,000,000, and
deel ares they cannot exceed: Federal securities, Irom
$900,000,000 to $950,000,000; railroad, municipal and
other, less than $300,000,000, giving an outside esti-
mate of SI,250,000,000.
our securities, public or private, we. ship the
latter; and, the zeal of trade gives us that
which money will buy instead of a part of the
coin. So long as American securities ;go to
Europe they will tend to make our imports
of goods exceed our exporls. That is a fact
in our situation. It does not depend upon
tariffs or theories of revenue. So long as this
country affords large returns for capital in safe
investments, capital will come hither. We
could wish that its owners should eome with
it. We cannot keep the capital away while our
prosperity continues the wonder of the world.
A third great fact is, that in the record of
imports does not appear the grandest item of
all, the import of men, nor even their money
value. From 1866 to 1871, 1,642,477 immi-
grants came to oar shores. If we could for-
get their brain power and soul value the sta-
tistician cannot refuse to allow that they bring
and represent an average of $800 each in
money, or equal to more than half of our
imports, not less than $262,876,000 a year.
And this-addition, to our wealth is stable and
abiding and productive. ,
british imports an& exports.
But suppose wo give to the figures , their
fullest force; concede that the balance of trade
isagainst us, that we import more than we ought,
and that the ratio of our exports isdiminishing.
We seek a remedy. Surely we cannot find it
by adopting the Britisli financial policy, for if
our balance-sheet is not satisfactory, that of
Britain does not justify envy on our part.
The imports of Great Britain have been for
fourteen years increasing more.rapidly than
the exports. In 1856 the imports werei £6 3s.
2d. per head, and the exports of British pro-
duce £4b 2s. 10<Z. per head; while ii| 1870 the
imports were £9 16s. 9c?. per head, aiid the
exports of British produce were £6 9s. 6d.

Abstract as presented to Parliament:

dom, with proportion thereof per head of total population.

The Bureau of Statistics of our Treasury Department gives the total value of British imports for 1871 at
£326,834,647, and the exports of British produce at £219,319,671; showing that the process of divergence
continues and is intensified. Comment is based on official figures only.
