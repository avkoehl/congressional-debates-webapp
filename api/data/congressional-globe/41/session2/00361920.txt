THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 14,
of having the present system extended, which
compels the Government to pay double inter-
est, I would go with him to afford the same
banking facilities to his section of the country
that are enjoyed by other sections. But I will
say to the gentleman, as a "practical business
man, that if we were to place $1,000,000 a
year in his town it would not stay there a day
if the exchanges of the country were allowed
to control it. If his people were the creditors
then it would stay with them ; but if they were
the debtors, then the circulation would leave
them to pay their debts. It is the same between
banking institutions and the people as between
individuals: the man who produces more than
he spends becomes rich, while the man who
expends more than he produces becomes first
embarrassed and ultimately bankrupt.

personal explanationâ€”-cuba.
Mr. SUMNER. With the permission of the
Senate, I desire to make a brief statement,
rendered necessary by what fell from General
Prim in the Cortes of Spain on Saturday last.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Massachusetts asks consent to make a brief
explanation, in response to the remarks of
General Prim in the Spanish Cortes. The
Chair hears no objection.
Mr. SUMNER. I find in the paper this
morning, under the head of foreign news, the
following telegraphic dispatch, dated Madrid-,
March 13:
"In tho Cortes yesterday a deputy asked if there
was any foundation for thestatementmade byaNew
York journal that Senator Schneb said he had re-
ceived propositions from General Prim for the sale
or cession of Cuba to tho United States. General
Priin pronounced the statement to be utterly false.J'
I deem it my duty to say that General Prim
is eutirely right whea he says that he made
no proposition to me for the sale or cession
of Cuba to the United States. I have had no
communication with him of any kind on any
subject. The statement in theNew York jour-
nal to which he replies was probably founded
on the fact that a gentleman purporting to be
an agent of General Prim, and coming directly
from him, was some time during the last spring
in Washington, and proceeded to invite the
attention of our Government to a mode of set-
tling the Cuban question in a manner advan-
tageous to the finances of Spain. I forbear to
give the details of this proposition, although
they are known to me. I saw this gentleman
at the time and heard his report. 1 will only
add that this report became the basis of the
proposition made by our Government through
General Sickles, which will be found in the
correspondence with Spain on our tables.

Mr. HOWELL. I present a joint resolu-
tion of the Legislature of Iowa, praying for
the establishment of a daily mail route from

The VICE PRESIDENT. If this is for
service upon a mail route already existing it
should be referred to the Postmaster General;
if for a new mail route it should go to the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads. It ap-
pears to be for daily mail service on an existing
