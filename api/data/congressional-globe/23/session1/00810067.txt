THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

' scientiously discharged a constitutional duty, I
' deem ¡t proper on this occasion, without a more
' particular reference to the views of the subject
' then expressed, to leave it for the present to the
■ investigation of an enlightened people and their
' representatives."
These aie all the messages until we have the
veto.
[Here Mr. C. read various extracts from the
veto message ]
The Secretary says that the extensive creditpos-
sessed by the Bank of the United States results
from its being the Government depository, and its
notes being made a legal tender in payment of
debts due the United States. Now, sir, could you,
by making your little Bank of the Metropolis the
public depository, and by enacting that its notes
should be receivable for debts due the United
States, could you make its notes five per cent
above par in foreign countries' Sir, do not we
know the real causes of the extensive credit of the
United States Bank notes> Is it not its large cap-
ita!, us connection with the Government, and the
ability with which it has been administered, but,
above all, like the Bank of England and the Bank
of Amsterdam, that, if there is anything wrong in
its management, the Government will expose it'
These aie the causee, and not that its notes are
made leceivable for debts due the United States.
Another argument used is, the expansion of its
powers and the contraction ot its loans, and that
all this 's done for political effect. Sir, how does
the Secretary know tin- ' What is there to au-
thorize this inference' Why does he seem every
fciTortof the bank to piotect itself that it is me you
attack ' What does he see in the people of this
nation so coriupt as to justify the belief that they
can be bought up by the money of the bank' Sir,
every consideration lequired that the Secretary
should give a coriect motive, never a wrong one
Cannot every man account for the contiaction of
the loans of the bank, wtien the Government had
despatched an agent to pry into its concerns—and
such an agent' Sir, the power to remove tne
moneys, it is tiue, is with the Secretaiy, but to
keep them is with the Tieasurei By the act of
17b9 he lb put under an oath, and bound to take
ca-eof the moneys Suppose the becretary usuips
the powei of the lienburer, and the moneys aie
lost, is the Secretary liable '   No, sir
The next objeción ib that the bank has devolved
home of lit. duties upon the executive committee,
whioh ought to be done by the whole boaid of
dnectois Now, sir, every bank doing an ex-
change busn ess in the United States has an ex-
change committee The directors meet and do the
ordinary business, and leave the piesidmg officer
to execute theirdueetions I his is the invariable
piactice But the Government dneotors aie ex-
cluded ' Well, sn , it tne Government choose
incompetent, inexperienced men, they cannot
exp°ct anything else
The next objection is, the affair of the Trench
bill And il is is a meie ordinal y mercantile opei
ation, and the bank did no more than it wasjus-
ti'ied by its cnaiter in doing to preserve its ciedi'
Bui. t e bank is u ml g at pillara' power' Now,
sir, let us auvert to what this reckless Secietaiy
says [Here Mi C lead from the Secietaiy's
leport] Where, sir, is the pioof, wheie tne posi-
tive evidenc-of this exeicise of political power'
Has it cone to this, that, in a count y where theie
is a fiee pi ess, a public banking institution shall
not be permitted to publish ai titles in ltb own de-
fence, and upon the finances of thecuuntry loit
come to tin , that a becietary of the freisuiy has
u light to aninadveit upon pab'ications made 1,1
the press' Un 'er what new sedition law has he
done vhis' Has he forgotten his party w ho passed
that 11J law and that ti e countiy la yet free'
Here Mr C 's 1 «-marks were anested by amo-
tion of Mi POINDEXI'ER. to adjourn, which

BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.
Mr. BINNE Y presented the following memorial
from several of the banks in Philadelphia.
To the Senate and House of Rep esentatives of the
United States 111 Cong) ess assembted
The memorial of the undersigned, the Presidents of the
State Banks heated m the city and county of Phil-
adelphia, acting under the authoiity of the Boaids
ofDirectoi s of the several Banks, 1 espectfully icpie-
sents
That they address themselves to your honoiable
bodies as the guardians of the general interests of
the country, and as possessing alone the power of
remedying the existing distress, and of averting
the gieatei calamities which aie obviously im-
pending.
That one of the first blessings a nation can pos-
sess is a sound and well-regulated currency—the
solid and sure reward of industry, and the uniform
measui e of pi operty, and it was not the least among
the many advantages anticipated from the Consti-
tution that the whole Union would, by the legisla-
tive power, be relieved and preserved fiom the
dangers and disgrace of adepiaved and lriespon-
sible cnculating medium. Such a sound cmrency
this nation has enjoyed, by means of the Bank of
the United States, established by the wisdom of
Congress, and the peculiar occupation of the under-
signed justifies them in ctating the'r conviction
that it is owing, in a gieat degree, to the judicious
opeiations of that institution, that for ten yeais
past our moneyed system has been so perfect—
and that whether its solidity, its adaptation to the
wants of all classes of the community, us facilities
foi internal commerce, and its ptotection against
the vibrations of foreign trade be regaided, it has
no supermr in any country It is, theiefore, with
deen legret that the undersigned aie now con-
strained to inform Congiess that, in their belief,
this system, with the signal piosperity it has pro-
duced, has undergorea sudden and painful change.
The moneyed opeiaaons ot out cummeicial cities
are almost at a stand, the commerce between the
States is again laboring undei a tax, which must
continue increasing, of a loss on all its exchanges,
the circulating medium already begins to ai range
itself on the scale of depreciation; while in the
train of these evils, and not far behind them, may
be apprehended a general abandonment oí specie
payments
In looking for the cause of this state of things,
'he undeisigned feel no difficulty in naming that
which is at once obvious and adequate On the
1st of Oclooei last, the whole moneyed system of
this country commenced a total change To the
eye of a common observei, it seemed to be the
mere tnnsfer of the public i°\ enne fiom one bank
to m°ny banks j^nt it was, in fact, the discigam-
zation of the vnole moneyed sys'em and the
whole levenue "ystem of the country Until the
1st of Oi. ober, the levenue paid by tne whole
country was diilused by the bank and its manches
throughout the whole community, to be used for
the suppoit of the industry of the whole, and
gent'y recallel when 1 ^edfu! for the sei\ te of the
whole, while the bink, as the common fuend of
all sound S ate banks, uniting with 1 d sustaining
them, was enibled to supply an adequate cnculat-
ing me imm ftom its own resnu res, and to pie-
sei ve, in a unifoi m ¡*nd so md couditior, ti e issues
of the State institutions. Now,'he public ¡evenue
is m longer diffused thiooshout the whole Union,
it cannot even be advantageously used wheie it
is collected, and the Bank of the United States,
whose expansive power and ciedi' have been so
fiequent'y employed to relieve the community,
mu t look necessauly and pnmaiily to its own
security
Happily for the country, the remedy for this
distiessmg state of things is as evident as the cause
ofit Tne undeisigned do not hesitate to express
tl en be'ief, that as the rpmoval of the deposites of
¡he United States fiom the Bank of the United
