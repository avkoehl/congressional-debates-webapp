General BURNSIDE:

Have heard from Comstock. He says General Benham has sand-bags. I have telegraphed to General Barnard to have 7,000 or 8,000 sent you to-night either by Benham or Abbot. I will be down to see you early to-morrow, say 6 or 7 o'clock. I wish to go at once to see the work required. Can't go to-night. Let me know by telegraph, if necessary to send at once for them, what guns you want-siege guns, mortars, or 8-inch siege howitzers. When will you want to put them in position, probably?

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL WEITZEL'S HEADQUARTERS, June 25, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

I have just ordered 8,000 sand-bags to be sent to you from my depot at Bermude Hundred with all possible haste. I imagine they will reach you about 1 o'clock. What position do you occupy with reference to Smith?

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Chief Engineer.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

Your dispatch is received. I am very much obliged to you for the sand-bags, and shall be ready to receive them. My position is immediately on the left of General Smith.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, FIRST DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 25, 1864.

Lieutenant C. J. MILLS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: The firing to-night is reported by Captain Holman, brigade officer of the day, to have been caused by the advance of a light skirmish line on Potter, whose pickets replied heavily. Very little more than our extreme left was engaged. The enemy retired. The abatis is nearly completed and is very strong. I have never seen better or more impassable; that in the woods is slashing, while on the open it is built. I think the general will be satisfied.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EBENEZER W. PEIRCE,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-Charge just now on our right, Tenth Corps. Enemy suspects movement and is feeling the lines, I suspect.
