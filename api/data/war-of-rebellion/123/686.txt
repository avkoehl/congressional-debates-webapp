SAML. J. KIRKWOOD,

Governor of Iowa.

ALBANY, October 24, 1862.

General CULLUM:

DEAR GENERAL: You will not have forgotten what occurred at your office a few days since in relation to the number of recruits furnished by New York since the 3rd of July. It was stated that not more than 30,000 had been received. The amount stated differed so fearfully from what had been represented here that upon my return I requested Governor Morgan to give me in figures the precise number. In compliance with my request he has sent me a statement, which I inclose. It shows that the Government is chargeable with more than twice 30,000 in her account with New York. If you detect any errors in the statement I should be glad to be advised of it.

Yours, with esteem,

IRA HARRIS.

STATE OF NEW YORK, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Albany, October 23, 1862.

Honorable IRA HARRIS, Albany:

SENATOR: I am directed by the Governor to furnish you with the following information: For the period since the 2nd of July last, to and including to-day, there have gone from this State 72,703 volunteers. There are now raised since July 2, 1862, 83,353.

The following more specific statement will show the number of new organizations and the number of recruits for old regiments. It is but proper to say that the muster-rolls would show a still larger number, but these figures embrace only those actually leaving the State with the regiments. It should be kept in mind that there are always stragglers and hospital patients left behind by each regiment, who finally join them and who are armed in Washington or elsewhere beyond the State. These are not counted in this statement.

Statement giving the number of recruits furnished by the State of New York, and the actual number of men in the field and in the State.
