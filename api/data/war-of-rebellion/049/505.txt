rear. General Wright, with an escort of 12 men, has gone by that road, and will give you all the information about affairs to-day. I have lost some 200 killed and wounded, and have that many prisoners. Lee was in my front about dark with Johnson's and Rodes' divisions of Ewell's corps. If I leave this point, it gives the road to Jacobs' Ford to the enemy.

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding Third Corps:

I am instructed to say that orders are sent to General Sedgwick to move his corps immediately to Robertson's Tavern, by a route Captain Michler will point out, as the commanding general finds there is great difficulty in your doing so. You will make every effort to carry out the orders heretofore sent you to unite your left with General Warren's right near Robertson's Tavern.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

[P. S.]-General Sedgwick will be posted on General Warren's right so as to aid in effecting a junction with you.
