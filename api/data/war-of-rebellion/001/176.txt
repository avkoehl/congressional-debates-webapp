I think these batteries can be destroyed by our fire by concentrating it upon one embrasure at a time, and aiming at the embrasure itself.

I cannot yet determine what is being done at Fort Moultrie. In addition to the sand bags, which raises the sole of the exterior about two feet, the whole embrasure is filled with a large bag of wool or cotton.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Captain of Engineers.

No. 48.] FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 18, 1861.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that we did not observe that any work was being carried on within view yesterday except by a small party of negroes, engaged in extending the covered way from the bomb-proof battery in the direction of the steamboat landing near it.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

No. 49.] FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 19, 11861.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the South Carolinians are still at work near the bomb-proof battery on Cummings Point. I am not certain as to their intentions. The accompanying sketch, just taken by Captain Seymour, shows the appearance of their work as we see it from our walls.*

We are daily adding to our defensive arrangements. I have had the parapet cut down in front of one of the 24-pounders on the gorge, which, by a slight alteration of the carriage, &amp;c., enables me to get a depression of 18 1/2, thus commanding, with a charge of canister, the greater portion of the wharf and the right basin. I am also having some of the flagging removed at the base of the wall in various places, thus obstructing their movements in the event of their effecting a landing at the base of our work.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

P. S.-Since the above letter was written, the inclosed copy was handed me of the proceedings of the council of administration on the application of the Rev. Mr. Meues, of Bath, Me., for the chaplaincy of this post. Although very desirous of having the privilege of having a chaplain here, I cannot but think that in the present condition of affairs, and this, too, not having been designated as a chaplaincy post, it would not be expedient to have one now sent us. I appreciate very highly the motives which appear to have governed the reverend gentleman in making his application, and regret that it has not been deemed proper to ask that his request should be granted.

Respectfully,

R. A.
