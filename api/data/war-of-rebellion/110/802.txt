MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 31, 1864.

Major General H. COBB,

Macon, Ga.:

General Hood, under date of the 27th, headquarters in the fied, dispatches General Taylor that some spare troops from Corinth have been ordered down the Mobile road to drive enemy away, and requests that he co-operate from below with sufficiently large force to accomplish this purpose. Colonel Miles, at Corinth, says enemy's gun-boats have all gone down river and that railroad is but slightly damaged this side of Tupelo, which will be repaired in a few days. This is all from General Hood. Will keep you advised. Telegram of 27th was answered thus. "Charges, if sent here and proper, will be approved for trial."

RICHMOND, VA., January 2, 1865.

General FRANK GARDNER,

Jackson, Miss.:

Information of the most painful character has reached me connected with the recent advance of the enemy to Liberty, involving the good faith of at least one officer exercising important command in our service. You will make prompt and thorough investigation, calling on Brigadier-General Hodge for such information as will direct your inquiry. You will also endeavor to change the troops which have been serving in the lower part of the district you command for others who may be available.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
