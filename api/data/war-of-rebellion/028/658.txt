MAJOR RICHARDSON'S CAMP, October 8, 1862.

GENERAL: I saw General Lee last evening. He says he wants the crippled guns sent to Staunton this evening or to-morrow. An officer from General Jackson's corps and General Longstreet's will be detailed by Colonel Brown and myself to accompany the guns, with drivers, to Staunton, and return, with drivers, such of the horses as are fit for service, the rest to be turned over to the quartermaster in Staunton. The general does not wish any horses taken from the disbanded batteries, but indifferent horses may be exchanged. Though I get more men from Captain Nelson than Major Nelson, the major took the pick of all his horses yesterday, so I will not be benefitted by any exchange. It is important that the guns start to-morrow morning.

Your, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Colonel Artillery, C. S. Army.

[Brigadier-General PENDLETON.]

P. S.-The ammunition will have to go to Staunton in the chests, as the ordnance officer can make no arrangement about taking it.

General R. E. LEE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: This letter will be handed you by Mr. R. L. Owen, president of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, who is authorized to bring away such rolling stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as may be suitable for his road. You are respectfully requested to afford him every facility that you can in connection with the proposed enterprise.

Your obedient servant,

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 9, 1862.

Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War:

SIR: I regret much to hear of the capture of the batteries on Saint John's River, Florida, news of which is conveyed in your telegram to Brigadier General G. H. Steurat. The Florida regiments in this army are reported to be in a pretty good state of drill and discipline, and constantly improving. So far from being able to comply with Governor Milton's wishes in sending troops to Florida, I would rather ask for re-enforcements to the Florida regiments now with us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 9, 1862.

Major General GUSTAVUS W. SMITH, Commanding At Richmond:

GENERAL: I have the honor to receive your letter of the 2nd instant.* I had previously received the telegraph to which you allude.
