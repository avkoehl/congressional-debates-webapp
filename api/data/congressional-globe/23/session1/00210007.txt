THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Government, in the steps which it has taken
on this subject, has been found in the line of its.

The accompanying report of the Secietaiyof
War, with the documents annexed to it, exhibit
the operations of the VVai Department for ihcpast
year, and condi'ion of the various subjects in-
trusted to its administration.
It will be been from them that the Army main-
tains the character it has heretofore enquired for
efficiency and military knowledge 'Nothing has
occuried since your last session to require it , ser-
vices beyond ihe oidmary íoutine of duties which,
upon the sea-board and the inland frontier, devolve
upon it in a time of peace Ihe svsten, so wisely
adopted and so long; pursued, ot coiistiucungfoit'
fications at exposed points, nod of preparing and
collecting: the supp'ies necessary for the military
defence of the country, and thus providently fur-
nishirg, in peace, the means of defence in wai, has
been conti.mtd wiih the usual results I recom
mend to your consideration the various subjects

Their adoption would promote 'he public service
and meliorate the condition of the Aimy
Our relatione with the various Indian tribes have
leen undistuibed since the termination of the dif-
ficui íes giowirg out of the hostile aggressions of
the Sacs and Fox Indians. Several treaties have
been formed for tne relinquishment of temtoiy to
the United States, an 1 foi the migra'ion of the oc
cupants to the legion pssigned for their residence
west of the Mississippi Should these treaties be
ratified by the Senate, provision will have been
made for the removal of almost all the tribes now
lemainmg east of that liver, and for the termina-
tion of many difficult and embarrassing questions
ausing out of their anomalous political condition
It .s to be hoped those portions of two of the south-
ern tribes which, in that event, will present the only
remaining difhculues, will realize the necessity of
emigration, and will speed'ly resort to it My
original convictions upon this subject have been
confirmed by the course ot events for several yeais,
and experience is every day adding to their
strength That those tribes cannot exist, sur-
rounded by our settlements, andm continual con-
tact with ourcitizens, iscertain They have neither
the intelligence, the indastry, the moral habits, nor
the desire of improvement, which are essential, to
any favorable change in their condition Estab-
lished m the midst of another and a supenorrace,
and without appreciating the causes of their mfe-
rioiity, or seeking to control them, they must
necessarily yield to the<brceof circumstarces, and
eie long disappear Such has been theirfatehere
tofore,andif ltisto be averted, and it is, it can only ,
be done by a general leraoval beyond our boundary
and by the íeorgamzation of their poli icil system I
upon principles adapted to the new relaaon3 in
which they will be placed The expeiiment which !
has been recently made has so far proved success-
ful The emigrants generally are represented to
be prosperous and contented, the country suitable
to their wants and habits, and the essential articles
of subsistence easily procuied When the report
of the commissioners now engaged m investiga-
ting the condition and prospeets of these Indians,
and in devising a plan foi their intercourse and
government, is received, I trust ample means of
information will be in possession of the Govern-
ment for adjusting all the unsettled questions con-
nected Aiith this interesting subject
The operations of the Navy during the year,
and its present condition, are fully exhibited in the
annual report from the Navy Department
Suggestions are made by the Secretary of vari-
ous improvements, which deserve careful consid-
eration, and most of which, if adopted, bid fair to
promote the efficiency of this important branch
of the public service Among these are the new
organization of the Navy Board, the revision of
the pay to officeis, and a change in the period of
time, or m the manner of making the annual ap-
propriations, to which I beg leave to call your
particular attention
The views which are presented on almost every
portion of our naval concerns, and especially on
the amount of force and the number of officers, and
the general course of policy appropriate in the
present state of our country, for securing the great
and useful purposes of naval protection in peace
and due preparation for the contingencies of war,
meet with my entire approbation
1 It will be perceived from the report referred to,
that the fi-cal concerns of the establishment a-e in
an excellent condition, and u is hoped that Con-
gress may feel disposed to make promptly every
suitable provision desired euhei foi piesemng oi
i improving the system
I The General Post Office Department has con
tinued, upon the strength of its own resources, to
facilitate the means of communication between the
various portions of the Union with increased ac-
tivity The method, however, in which the ac-
counts of the transportation of the mail has always
been kept, appeals to have presented an imperfect
view of us expenses It has recently been discov-
ered that, from the earliest recoids of the Depart-
ment, the annual statements have been calculated
to exhauit an amount considerably, short of the
actual expense lruu red for that set vice These
illusory statements, together with the expense of
eairying into effect the law of the last session of
Congress establishing new mail routes,and a dis-
position on the part of the head of the Department
t j gratify the wishes of the public m the extension
¡ of the mail facil ties, have induced him to incur
responsibilities for then improvement beyond what
! the current resources of the Depai tment would sus-
tain As soon as ne had discovered the imperfec-
tion of the method, he caused an investigation to
be made of its results, and applied the proper
remedy to correct the evil It became necessary
foi him to withdraw some of the improvements
I which he had made to bring the expenses of the
Department within its own resources These ex-
penses were incurred for the public good, and the
public have enjoyed their benefit They are now
but partially suspended, and that where they may
be discontinued with the least inconvenierce to the
country
I The progressive increase in the income from
! postages has equalled the highest expectations, and
it affords demonstrative evidence of the growing
importance and great utility of this Department
The details are exhibited in the accompanying
report from the Postmaster General
The many distressing accidents which have of
late occuned in that portion of our navigation
carried on by the use of steam power, desei ve the
immediate and unremitting attention of the con
stituted authorities of the country. The fact that
the numbei of those fatal disasters is constantly
increasing, notwithstanding the great improve-
ments which are everywhere made in 'he maohm
ery employed, and m the rapid advances which
have beer made in that branch of science, show
very clearly that they are in a gieat degree the re-
sult of criminar negligence on the part of those by
whom the vessels are navigated, a id to whose care
and attention the lives and | roperty of our citizens
are so extensively mti usted
That these evils may be greatly lessened, if not
substantially removed, by means of precautionary
and pena' legislation, seems to be highly probable
so far, theiefoie,as the s-ibject can be regarded as
within the constitutional pmview of Congress, I
earnestly recommend it to youi prompt and se-
rious consideration
I would also call your attention to the views I
have heretofore expressed of the propriety of
amending the Constitution in i elation to the mode
of electing the Pres.dent and the Vice President of
the United States Regarding it as all important
to the future quiet and harmony of the people that
every intermediate agency in the election of these
oncers should be removed, and that their eligi-
bility should be limited to one term of either four
or six years, I cannot too earnestly invite your
consideration of the subject
Trusting that your deliberations on all the topics
of general interest to which I have adverted, and
such others as your more extensive knowledge of
the wants ef our beloved country may suggest,
may be crowned with success, I tender you, m
conclusion, the cooperation which it may be in my
power to afford them

I The resolution from the Senate, appointing a
committee to wait upon the President and inform
j him that the two bodies ate organized and ready
I to receive his communications, was*concurred rn,
| and Messrs WARD and SPEIGHT were ap-
pointed on the part of the House
The oaths of office were then adm.mstered to
the Clerk, Walter S Franklin
The House, on motion of Mr MASON, pro-
ceeded to the election of Sergeant-at-Arms
Mr MASON nominated Thomas B. Randolph,
and Mr SPDIGHTnominatedWilliem Robinson,
220 ballots were given, of which number—
Thomas B Randolph received 158 votes.

Mr. CLAY submitted the following resolution,
which was agreed to
Resolved, That Overton Carr be appointed Door-
keeper, and John W Hunter, Assistant Door-
keeper, of the House of Representatives.
The oath of office was then administered to the
Sergeant at-Arms and Doorkeepers elect.
The usual resolutions for the appointment of
chaplains and foi furn>shmg the members with
newspapers were adopted.
Mr HUBBARD moved that all the former rules
for the governmentof the House be adopted, with
the exception of the 56 h ard 76th
Mr. WILLIAMS wasunwillmg to decide upon
a mattei involving a change in the rules of the
House without s ime time for consideration. He
did not exactly understand what would be the effect
of the proposed alteration, and he moved that the
motion he on the table
Mi HUBBARD explained thatone of his prop-
ositions would be to increase the number of the
members of the standing committees from seven
to nine, and of the other committees from three
to five He also intended to propose that the
members should sit uncovered until the Speaker
should otherwise direct
After a few words fiom Mr BURGES in favor
of a postponement of the subject,
Mr WILLIAMS said that the proposition to
sit without hats had often been submitted, and had
always been rejected It had been rejected on the
ground that there was no convenient place for put-
ting our hats, but he supposed that those who
propose the change would provide a place He
doubted, also, whether we should increase the
efficiency of the committees by increasing their
number It was difficult to get the attendance of
four members, which was the majority of seven,
and it would be still more difficult to get five, the
majority of nine He wished time for reflection
on the subject, and renewed his motion to lay the
mattei on the table
Mr SUTHERLAND suggested that nothing
would be gained by letting the subject he on the
table The House would be embarrassed unless
rules were adopted.
Mr PATTON moved that the 9th rule be also
excep'ed, stating that it was his intention to move
a modification of the 9th rule, to the effect that the
Speaker should vote in the first instance 111 all
cases, and that if the House be equally divided
the question should be lost
The motion, as modified at the suggestion of
Mi   Patton, was agreed to
On motion of Mi DAVIS, of Massachusetts,
the House then adjourned
