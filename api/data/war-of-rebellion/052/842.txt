VICKSBURG, September 25, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Dispatches from General Halleck, of date the 13th instant, show that the forces from here are to move via Corinth and Tuscumbia to co-operate with Rosecrans. You will therefore hold two of the remaining divisions of your corps in readiness to move to this place for embarkation to Memphis on receipt of notice that transportation is provided. You will go in command. The division you leave will report to General McPherson in place of Smith's division, of his corps, which will accompany you. You will take no cavalry. By order of Major-General Grant:

JNumbers A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 25, 1863.

General GRANT:

Your dispatch received. The preliminary orders will be issued the moment Colonel Coolbaugh is outside our lines with his flag of truce. It is best that the withdrawal of my corps be kept secret from the enemy as long as possible.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 25, 1863.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Vicksburg:

I have just inspected and reviewed my Fourth Division. I will take the Second and Fourth Divisions and leave Tuttle's; this division and the cavalry can cover the points of Big Black.

McPherson will be out to-morrow, and I will show him everything and leave him to dispose of the force left behind. I have ordered the sick and all surplus baggage to be sent in by cars, and will hold the troops to march at an hour's notice, having their wagons ready to load up. I can easily start on Sunday, and embark by Monday, if you have the boats.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 25, 1863.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Vicksburg:

You remember the report of the board determining the battles each regiment of my command could inscribe on their colors. Do you understand that the order for such inscription is made by the War Department, by you, or by me? I want to bring up the records
