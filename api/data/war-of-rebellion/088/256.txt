Colonel SHARPE,

City Point:

I have prisoners here from Wright's brigade, of Mahone' s division, of Hill's corps. They say that they think their whole division is there. They know that Weisiger's, Wright's, and Perrin's are. I have also prisoners from Lane's and Conner's of Wilcox's, on north side of James, and full information from Thomas' and Scales, who are in our front here. This makes all of Wilcox here. I have also four prisoners this morning from bushrod R. Johson's old brigade, Colonel Hughs commanding, in our front at Deep Bottom.
