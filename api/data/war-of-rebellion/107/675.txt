HEADQUARTERS FIFTH PROVISIONAL ARMY CORPS,Camp near New Bridge, Va., June 13, 1862.

Brigadier-General MARTINDALE,

Commanding, Mechanicsville, Va.:

GENERAL: The commanding general instructs me to write you as follows in his name: The object of sending your command temporarily to Mechanicville is to secure (with General Stoneman's command on your right and scouting up the Chickahominy) our right flank from surprise and to prevent the enemy crossing at Mechanicsville. The command now at Mechanicsville is well posted. You infantry pickets extend to Meadow Bridge, where are two companies of infantry and a picket of cavalry. Your cavalry will also patrol and picket the roads leding north and west. General Stoneman watches a private bridge about half a mile up the river. Cavalry has been asked for to report to you for picket duty and to keep up communication with the commanding general. The commanding general desires your to require frequent communication from your advanced guards and pickets, and report to him the cause and effect of all firing unusual occurrences coming to your knowledge. Desertes, negroes, &amp;c., coming in must be sent down without delay, and sprangers and negroes must not be permitted to go to the pickets, and in fact all suspicious persons must be arrested and held in custody. A balloon is near you, and you are desires to have observations taken as often as weather will permit, and the result reported. The commanding general desires to call your attention to a ravine this side of Mechanicsville, where a small force can resist successfully a much larger one, and over which only one bridge is known to exist. That one you cross. He also desires you to keep your command in marching order and with little baggage. You will probably be soon recalled.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
