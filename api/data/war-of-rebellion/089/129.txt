The entire corps will be under arms at 6 a. m. and ready to move. At 7 a. m. the enemy's picket-line will be driven in along our whole front.

Brigadier-General Griffin will hold his division in readiness to support the attack in case it is necessary to make a more extended attack. The chief of artillery will supply the necessary batteries in case of an advance. General Ayres will select an officer to advance the picket-line of the whole corps. One brigade from each division will support its own picket-line in the advance.
