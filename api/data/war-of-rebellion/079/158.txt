It is certain his force greatly outnumbered mine. A detachment sent to Pound Gap forced its way through and drove Prentice, with a superior force, from his works at Gladeville, capturing several prisoners, a number of small-arms and 1 piece of artillery. Our loss in all is about 350; the enemy's more. Report fully by mail. On the 3rd received order from General Sherman to return.
