Honorable JAMES M. MASON,

Winchester, Va.:

SIR: I have been gratified at the reception of your letter of the 15th instant, giving an account of you visit to Harper's Ferry. I had hoped that the Maryland people would relieve us of the necessity of occupying the Maryland Heights. Colonel Jackson was directed to give to their occupation the appearance of its being done by the people of that State, and not to take possession himself till necessary; but the time has been left to his discretion which I am sure will be wisely exercised. There is no doubt, under the circumstances, of our right to occupy these heights.

Measures have been taken, more than three weeks ago, for securing the control of both branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and for throwing a force into the disaffected region of the State; to carry out which Major Loring has been sent to Wheeling to protect the terminus of the main road, and Colonel Portefield has been sent to Grafton, with instructions to concentrate there regiments, at Parkersburg one regiment, and at Moundsville one regiment. These measures having in part field, several companies have been sent from Staunton to Beverly, with instructions to gather strength as they passed through the country for Colonel Porterfield's command. By these means it is hoped that a considerable force has been concentrated at Grafton by this time, and loyalty in some degree engendered in the disaffected region of which you speak.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 21, 1861.
