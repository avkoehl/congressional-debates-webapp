Allow me to call attention to the establishment of telegraph communication via the railroad to Culpeper. For the present I will keep up communication between Culpeper and Warrenton by a line of estafettes, without I find at the former a readier mode of reaching you.

Agreeably to your orders, to be informed when Ricketts' and Charroll's troops shall have reached a point one day's march from Culpeper, I have to acquaint you that by a report just received they are near Hazel Run, and to-morrow will be in Culpeper.

Major-General POPE,

Near Washington, Va.:

I sent you by mail on the 3rd instant a report of the engineer officer whom I sent to examine Ely's Ford and the Germanna Mills Crossing. As it may not arrive, I report the substance of his statement. At Germanna Mills there is no ford. There was a bridge, which the enemy burned. The distance between the abutments is about 200 feet. The piers are six in number, all standing but the center one; distance between pier, 30 feet; height above river, 30 feet; in timber abundant in vicinity; steam saw-mill in good order, with considerable lumber on hand; Ely's Ford good, but approaches bad. I will remark that it is as near, and it is a sure road to come up the left bank of the Rappahannock and cross either at Norman's Ford or at the one right below.
