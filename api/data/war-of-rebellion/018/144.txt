before Williamsburg and not in a position to prevent an advance on me, have all caused me to believe that it is highly probable that they may attack me before I shall have force enough to attack them. I have therefore ordered up Brigadier-General Ricketts and two of his regiments from Aquia Creek and a battery from Belle Plain. If the place had not been indicated by the President as one he wishes held I would at once order the bulk of Hartsuff's brigade from Catlett's, for this is evidently the point of attack.

The order of the 2nd found a large portion of my force on detached service. In the present state of affairs I have thought some of going by way of Culpeper Court-House, if there be any likelihood of receiving support and supplies on arriving there. May I inquire when the railroad bridge of the Rappahannock is likely to be finished? Could I have support and supplies at the place within ten days from this? Would the general commanding deem it safe for me to take that route? Will he feel authorized to throw forward to that position?
