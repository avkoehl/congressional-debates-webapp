HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

You will please order Willcox at once move down the plank road and take position on that road at the forks of the road Reams' Station. This is, I believe, near a place called Chay's or Cay's [Shay's] Tavern. There are several roads leading to Reams', but I refer to the first main or practicable road below the Williams house. He can take there batteries with him. Let him communicate and report to Hancock when he arrives there.

Major-General.
