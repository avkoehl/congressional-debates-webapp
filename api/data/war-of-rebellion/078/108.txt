COLLIERVILLE, June 12, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

I did intend remaining here until to-morrow principally to enable stragglers to get in, but from information just received of a force moving in the direction of White's Station, I deem it prudent to mach for that place to-night, and will do so.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, Memphis, Tenn., June 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General STURGIS:

Do you want any more cars sent out? Is there any truth about the enemy moving south of Collierville White's Station as you mentioned a while since? Are you perfectly safe, and do you want anything?

C. C. WASHBURN,Major-General.

COLLIERVILLE, June 12, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

GENERAL: What I know a force moving toward White's Station was reported to me. I have everything I want. It is reported that the One hundred and eighth [Illinois] Regiment was near La Grange this morning, organized, with plenty of ammunition, and commanded by the adjutant.

It will get in safe no doubt. I am just about withdrawing to White's Station as it is precarious here.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
