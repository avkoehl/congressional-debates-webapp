he gave way for a motion for the committee to

thatduty, discovered that Mr Randolph had reserved a large
sum of public money left by the deceased purser on board
of his ship, with which he Had never been eharged,,arrd
other propertv, public and private, for which he did not ap-
pear to have accounted The amount was accordingly
charged to Inn on the books of the .Fourth Auditor, where,
1 «uppose, the chirle still stands
Mr Randolph denied his indebtedness, alleging that he
had paid away the money en account of bis predecessor,
and taken the vouchers in his name, but could produce no
proof which would entitle him to credits tn the accounting
office It was the opinion Of a court of inquiry, called m
his case, that he had applied a portion of ere money m the
way he alleged, and that he was justly indebted lor the

I write from memory, and cannot particularize
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
AMOS KENDALL
Hon  A Dunc-an
I have been induced to make the mqutnes and exposures
here exluhited, in consequence of the following commu
mcation.
To the Hon Ji  Duncan, of Ohio
In a speech which has been published, said also to have
heen delivered by you, m the House of Representatives, I
find that you hive classed me among the public defaulters
However much you miy be m favor of abolition " in the
abstract," 1 hog that hereafter vou will not, m making use
of my name, abolish the truth I am no defaulter, as the
documents in my possession will show It may suit your
creed, sir to stand up in your place, and, with brazen front,
defame honest and honorable men , but >ou shall not use
your " pnvilege," where I am eonct rmd, without reeeiv
mg a proper contradiction You have quite enough to do to
detendthe peculations and frauds oí your political friends—
those who «¡teal millions and up stakes for England, as well
as those who steal tironsands and remain at anchor here~-
without caUimtnatiug innocent persons I therefore lee
ornmend to you a little caution m your future harangues
K B RANDOLPH,
Late of the United States Navy
Alexandria, January 29,1839
It was not from i «pint of resentment I have been induced
to notice the above communication No, I Has led to no
tice it from .i disp iMtion todo Mr Randolph justice and
right, if I had done him in nijurv, although I think most
readers will conclude, with me, tint Mr Randolph might
have seen abundance of reason m the following euraet to
have desisted from the above communication 1 lie extract
is taken from the speech to which Mr Randolph alludes,
and was m answer to Mr Beil, as the extract shows
When I was exposing the defalcation of the Messrs I r
wins, Mr BFiL,of Tennessee rose ind said the Lrwms
were not defaulters, it was a slander promulgated by the
Globe paper
" Mr Duncan responded, tint he did not get the inform
ation from the Globe, he obtained it from the records m
the archives of the Government—evidence of the highest
character, and that which is open to the view ot e\ ery one
who desires to read I hope (said Mr D ) it is not true
I would prefer to conceal, at all times, human weakness and
depravity, rather than expose, where it may be done with
out public injury, but I would prefer that such depravitj
as 1 am now exposing, did not exist And let me say,
once for all, that I know nothing personally of the numer
ous and wholesale frauds which I ara now exposing 1 am
alike ignorant of the men whom the records show to be
the perpetrators 1 hese fr mds, with the names of those
who committed them, are matters ot record, and the f icts
are spread over the whole country, and known to all who
read the Journals of Congress and the reports of the feecre
taryof the Treasury Consequent!*, my exposit on can
neither affect the reputation of those whose names I ex
pose or the cause of justice "
I say the remarks contained m this extract might have
well superseded the communication But Mr R volun
teers the following advice " I therefore recommend to \ou
a little caution m your future harangues ' I return my
thanks for this advice, and when I want more I will call
font Bait Mr R is unkind in saying " It may suit your
creed, sir, to stand up in your place, and, with brazen
front, defame honest and honorable men " I say this is an
unkind charge—is unkind if it is intended to fix on me a
claim of privilege in consequence of my representative
character I claim no privilege on th it gtound I hold
myself responsible for all I say, either m my personal or
representative character If, perchance, I am officially
compelled to notice men and things in a manner un pleas
ant, and I am to be held responsible in my individual capa
city, ail I ask is that he be a gentleman who so holds me
I want him to have clean hands He must be sueh a oue
who«e frauds have not been such as to place him out of
time and out of place when be is without the gloomy walls
of a degrading penitentiary He must not have the base
and degraded character of coward united to his reputation
m life and to Ins memory in death, by having pulled the
nose of an old patriot, withered and bleached by the frosts
of seventy winters, and worn to the brink of the grave by
services to his cctuntty.                            A DUNCAN
Therefore,
Resolved, Tirar the «aid Alexandfb Duncan has, in the
premises, subjected himself to the just censure of this
House, and that he be reprimanded therefor by the Speak-
er, in the presence of the House
Mr ELMORE then gave his reasons at length
why lie should sustain this motion. Mr. E.
having, as requested by the original mover, re-
newed the motion,
Mr. DROMGOOLE asked Mr Petrikin to
substitute ademand for the previous question, but
Mr  P. declined
Mr CUSHMAN called for the yeaa and nays,
which were ordered
Mr WISE moved a qall of the House; whjch
was agreed to—ayes 88, noes 69.
After the call was proceeded i  till two hundred
and sixteen members were ascertained to be pres-
ent,

KUt iiaymg again temporarily withdrawn the

REPORT FROM  A COMMITTEE.
Mr  EVERETT, from the  Committee on In-
dian Affairs, reported with amendments Senate
I bill to appoint  commissioners to adjust claims
under the Choctaw treaty
.                       COMMODORE ELLIOTT.
Mr NAYLOR, from the select committee ap-
I pointed to inquire into the conduct of Commodore
! Elliott, while commanding in the Mediterranean,
on leave, made a report thereon, which was read,
and was accompan'ed by the following resolu-
I tions
Resohed That an interference by the House of Represent
atives, in the disputes that occur between suboidinateoifi
eers of the Navy and their sup< nors, commanding squad
rons, is a power which ought at ah times to be exercised with
great caution, andis calculated to produce insubordination
m that important arm of the national defense     But, in the
opinion oí this committee, itis competent tor the Represent
1 atives of the people to investigate any abuses aiieged to be
committed by officers m command of squadrons, and to
provide by law, for the recurrence of such abuses, and more
i over to investigate and ascertain «hether the head of the
Navy Department may have used such means as are placed
in his hands by law to punish and prevent any such alleged
abuses
Resohed, That the most appropriate remedy for sueh
' subordinate officers is an appeal to the Secretary of the
I Navy for a court of inquiry to investígate the charges ex
| hibited against their superiors, and from his decision the
party aggrieved may appeal to the President who, by the
1 Constitution, is Commander m Chief of the Navy , he, as
! well as the Secretary, being liable to an impeachment lor
a willful and corrupt violation or neglect of duty
Resohed, That the time allowed this committee is msttffi
cient to enabl  them to make a full and thorough examin
ation of the subject committed to them , that even a lira
ited and partial examination would require them, contrary
to the duty they owe to their immediate constituents and
the country at large, to be absent darts during the sittings
. of the House at this important period ot the session
I     Resolved, there/ore, That it is inexpedient to commence
the investigation at this time, and that the chairman report
i these resolutions, with the journal oí our proceedings, to
1 the House, together with the opinion of this committee that
no quorum
Mt  S  íesumed and concluded, when the com-
mittee rose, and the House adjourned.
