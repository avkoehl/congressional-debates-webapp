WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., December 17, 1862.

Major-General McCLERNAND, Springfield, Ill.:

There has been, as I informed by General Halleck, no order superseding you. It was designed, as you know, to organize the troops for your expedition after they should reach Memphis or the place designated as their rendezvous. The troops having been sent forward they are now to be organized. The operations being in General Grant's department, it is designed all the troops of that department in three army corps, the First Army Corps to be commanded by you, and assigned to the operations on the Mississippi under the general supervision of the general commanding the department. General Halleck is to issue the order immediately.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
