but little [doubt] in my mind that Carrollton is occupied by the rebels. I have not sufficient force to move upon them. Send me one or two companies with which, and the little force I can raise here, I propose to move upon these villains.

W. T. CLARKE.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, September 22, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Our information does not yet warrant much southward movement to meet Price, whose line of movement is not yet developed, nor are we sure General Steele may not strike him in rear. Our dispositions ought to be so made that if he comes in he can never get out again. Ford will report to you for orders; don't take him from his position till the last moment.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
