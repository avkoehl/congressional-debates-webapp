the branch at Utica, could not have had any po-
litical oojeets in view in arranging t''e boaid of
d lectors, because, as he buys, they weie willing
and des rous of placing in that boaid m^uential
me'ibers of the Democratic party Sn, that is
what I stated I íefeired to that a evidence of
th v„ish to draw in that cla^iof individuals to sus-
1'iri the ba> k All expeiience proves that nme-
te >ths of loose who aie ip a^y way d'au n into a
management of the concerns of the bank or its
branches, slide Into its politico 1 views and are
iound aiiayed again t the Demociacy of the cou l-
try and pontic?!!/ m favor of the bank This
tie bark knew, and acted uoon it, it failed, how-
evet, in a great degree, in that object, maugie all
its efforts, fur ti ose woo were selected could not
be prevailed upon to lend themselves, for any such
purpos .
Cjt the le-ver could not have been got up and
sustained by the b'rk, as it broke down in a few
months' Ir would have cos', says the honoiable
gentleman, but §1,500 a yeai, a sum which the
bank wou'd not have regaided it is certain, there-
fore, that it could not have been the creature of
the bank I know («aid Mr B ) that the bank
caies little about jjl 500, but where tnat sun is
so invested as to yield no adequate retuin, n
money or influence, the bank, able as it is, would
certainly prefer to save the §¡,1,500 Sir, I might
inform the House that there aie papers in judicial
proceedings which establish very satisfactonly the
connexion between a part oí the bank direction and
the lever, but 1 choose not to occupy the attention
of the House fui ther upon this part of the subject
My colleague understands rae to have made a
censorious íemaik about the gentlemen wnose
names a^e annexed to the printed circular which
was read when the memorial was presented a
week since My remarks aie in punt and nust
speak foi themselves I deem it only propei,
however, to sta'e unequivocally that my colleague
has totally misappiehended my object and pur-
pose* I had no design to "nimadveit upon the
gentlenen iereneJ to, akiiough I deemed then
u cular a lit subject foi comment That will aUo
speak for itself, and I ira willing to submitit, with
my comments, to the judgment of the public.
This memorial, sir, has been pieserted and
commented on elsewhere, and it was there stated
that the county of Oneida was " laige'y interested
'in manufactures, both of woolen and cotton,
' which weie in active operation until the Execu
' ¡lve began its experiment, and as theexpenment
'his gone on, one of these establishments after
' another his stopped " This statement was said
to have been made on the authority of gentlemen
who weie "incapable of m siepiesentation " I
know not woo should have been referí ed to as the
ongiratois ol tl is statement, but 1 feel it to be my
duty to state, that 1 havednect intoimation on that
eubject fiom Oneida county, and that down to the
6 b instan' (seveial d^/s at er the statement had
been made) no such failure or failuies had occurred,
rothing had at any time taken place to wan ant
any such statement- or suspicion of the fadure of
anyone manufacturing establishment in that coun-
ty The gentleman who made the statement, I
cannot doubt, had what he regaided as good
aitlionty foi what he said, but it is equally certain
that i he statement is without foundation, lus made
by some o le out of whole cloth
The memorial íepresents the county of Oneida
as in the most deploiable condition Now, sir, I
cannot pretend to be furnished with all the indica-
tions which in fict evst, of the actual situation of
Us business population, out I have one evidence of
the prospen y of Utica, wn eh is veiy convincing
to my mind T! e Cue canal pistes tl iough Utica,
and a 'oil office is established in that city Now,
sn , although the tolls have been gieatly reduced
duang the last winter upon some propeity twenty
per cert , and on the le idue ten peí cent , yet a
greater amount ufioll Wt'scohectel inUtica duung
the mm h of Apul than n ti'h i of the two list
jev 1 (t is true, the canal opened th s year five
dajs earlier than the 'ant, but taking the number
c f days which it had been open, down to the 4 h
of 'his piesent month, a greater amount had b°en
leceived than in an equal numbei of days at the
commencement of the list year Thi= is a ve¡ y
substantial indication of individual and geneial
p ospenty.    And, as to the whole State, the aggre-
gate of the tolls received in the month of April this
year exceeded that of the last In fact, sir, 1
apprehend that the State at large was nevei more
thnving and prosperous.
My honorable co'league objects to a former
rema k of mine I did "ay that Í would sooner s e
the State institutions prostrated than submit to the
cor1 upt control of the United States Bink This
does not seem to accord with the views of my
colleague, he is for submission, he is for yielding to
the bank, let the consequences be what they may.
In this we differ My constituents do not, in tins
matter, as I believe, agree with the honorable
gentleman more than I do, they have hearts and
arms, as I tiu^t, to resist at all hazaids evei y effort
to bring then n passive obedience to the bank
But the bank, in the language of my colleague,
" seems to have the power of making political
enemies, not filends " This is, indeed, a new
idea Will the honorable gentleman look atNew
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore—indeed, m any
part of the Union >   Has the bank made political
i enemies only' None but enemies here or else-
where' Have its unpiecedented efforts only
resulted in making political enemies? Has it not
almost dena'ionahzed the feelings of a consider-
able pioportion of our countrymen ' Have not, in
many instances, the firmness and spirit of Amer-
ican Ireemen sunk under the influence of the bank'
" Give us the bank," is the cry, although at the
puce of degiadation and servitude, this is the im-
. I passioned expression of its followers and partisans
|| The bink only make "political enemies, not
fiends'" Is not its influence seriously impairing
the respectful leverence due to our moral and
lehgious institutions' Have we not recently seen
in a neighboring city a factious mob, assembled
in defiance of both 1 uman and d.vine law, for the
puipose of hearing inflammatory haiargues in
suppoi t of the bank on the S ibbath day ' A^e not
the eilorts which are now making to control the
population of oar cities m favor of the bank, cal-
culated to week en, if not to eiadicate, sound and
conect piincioles of conduct among the mass of
then citizens'
i     Sir, I have done     I will not trouble the House
I with any suggestions as to what my constituents
I may think of my remarks upon this memorial
I I hope nothing has been said by me which cm
deserve  tn<"r  reprehension,  but that  point my
I honorable colleague and myself will leave to be
I adjusted between the constituents and their tep-
!( resentitive
