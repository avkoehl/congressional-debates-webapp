Report of Colonel James Jourdan, One hundred and Fifty-eighth New York Infantry, with complimentary orders from Major General John J. Peck, U. S. Army. *
HEADQUARTERS SUB-DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT,Morehead City, N. C., December 26, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with instructions of Major-General Peck, I embarked, on the morning of the 24th instant, on board the U. S. gunboats Howquah and Daylight, with 125 men of the One hundred and fifty-eighth New York Volunteers, under command of Lieutenant Colonel W. H. McNary; 75 men of the Ninth Vermont Volunteers, under command of Colonel E. H. Ripley, and 8 men of the Second Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, with one howitzer from Fort Heckman, and proceeded direct to Bear Inlet.

In consequence of a slight collision with the Daylight in the harbor, the steamer Frazier, by which I intended to land the troops, was unable to accompany me. The damage sustained by the Frazier is reported slight.

On my arrival at Bear Inlet, I proceeded in the Howquah's cutter within the inlet, and reconnoitered, after which the troops disembarked in small boats, with one boat howitzer; effected a landing at an extensive salt-works, about 3 miles from the inlet, where we bivouacked for the night. In consequence of the rapid outflow of the tide, a part of the command were unable to land. Next morning (the 25th), while a portion of my force was employed in destroying the works, I sent two boats belonging to the Howquah to
