So with five of his men he charged them, killing the officer (a captain), capturing the colors and color bearer, and wounding 2 of the color guard. I will also forward you the names of the men who are entitled to the honors of helping to capture the flag: Jacob Cross, Eliphalet Greely, Joseph Goodwin, Corpl. N. Sprague, and Corpl. I. W. Rittenhouse. If consistent, I would most earnestly request that the colors be returned to Lieutenant Riggs as a reward of his bravery.

J. S. WINDSOR,

Commanding 116th Illinois Infantry.
