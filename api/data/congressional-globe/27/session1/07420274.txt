Whole number 395, and their whole
- capital       ....    96,7*87,309 ,
This, number of 395 banks, computed to have
failed in fifty years, may seem high, but it is not
so large as m England, where, notwithstanding any
favorable influence of a national bank existing near
a century and a half, it ha  happened that from 1793
to 1826, a period of only thirty-four years, 381 fail-
ures of banks have occurred, on which bankrupt
commissions were taken out Near four times
as many more, it is said, failed within that time and
compromised — Tucker on Money, p 252 "

whether' directly or indirectly,' and whether by 'the
people oi the Government'
It may be, theiefore, (hit the amount collected by
banks 1 rom the community annuallv, for mleiesl,
exchanges, lents, &c, ought, in the opinion of
man v, to be considei ed as what is paid to them ' for
the use of banking institutions' Consequently, an
attempt his been made, first, to form some estimate
of this amount which shall approximate the truth.
The result has been, that the whole payments
made to the banks for the use of them, their capital,
&c , during the last ten years, has been, m the ag-
gregate, $282 000,000
This would be annually, on an average,
£28,200000"

These are astounding results, and ought to make
the most sanguine friend of the bank pause Naj,
sir, they speak, " trumpet-tongued," against the
United States Bank, as well as our whole paper
sjstem
I will now eudeavoi to show that a federal bank
did not pimf> the currency, or at all times furnish
the country with a sound circulating medium In
support of this position, I beg permission to adduce
rarious authorities, to all of which I invite your
sti'uus attention
Lingdon Cheves was president of the Bank of the
United & ates before Mr Nicholas Biddle was , and
m the exposal ¡on of the slate of the bank, drawn up
by Mr Cheva, and laid before the stockholders, he
said
" The institution commenced active bankm 
operations about the 1st Januaiy, 1817, and in the
oursc of the year established eighteen branches
* * i- The bank, immediately on its commence
xnent did a ti ly pxlensive business, imported vast
sums of specie, paid ito notes and those of the offi-
ces Without reference to the places where they
were payable, at the bank, <fec * * * * * The
¡esult «as that the bank and the great northern
offices weie drained of their capital, and on the
JOth Jiih 1818, only eighteen months after the in
Mitution began its operations, it was obliged to com
menee a iap d and heavy curtailment of the business
of the bank and its offices During all this time, it
had the advantage of immense Government depos
J.°-    At the moment that curtailments were oi-
dered, the Government deposites m the bank and
its branches, including the deposites of public offi-
cers, amounted to eight millions of dollars, and
they had been larger at preceding periods. Cur-
tailments were ordered from time to time at the
southern and western offices, to the amount of
$3,600,000 and upwards, between the 30th July,
1818, and the 1st of April, 1819 * No curtailments
were ordered at the offices of New York and Bos-
ton, because there was no room for them, yet ne-
cessity obliged them to reduce their business very
much The curtailments at all points wi'hin the
abovementioned dates, being eight months, were
six million five hundred and thirty thousand dol-
lars Yet, after these immense and rapid curtail-
ments, the most sensible and vital points {Phila-
delphia, New York, and Boston) were infinitely m
worse condition than when the remedy was devised
* * * The «pecie in the vaults of the bank at
the close of the day on the 1st of April, 1819, was
only $126,745 28, and the bank owed the city
banks, deducting balances due to it, an aggregate
balance of $79,125 99. It is true there were in the
mint $267,978, and m transitu from Kentucky and
Ohio, over land, $250,000, but the Treasury
dividends were payable on that day to the amount
of near $500,000, and there remained at the close
of the day more than one-half of the sum subject to
draft , and the greater part of the sum which had
been drawn during the day remained a charge
upon the bank, in. the shape of temporary deposites,
which were almost immediately withdrawn Ac-
cordingly, on the 12th of the same month the bank
had m its vaults but $71,522, and owed to the city
banks a balance of 8,196,418—exceeding the specie
m its vaults $124,895 It must again be remarked,
that it had yet the sum before mentioned in the
mint, as well as the sum in ti ansitu from Ohio and
Kentucky, this la&t sum ($250,000) arrived very
seasonably on the next day, or a day or two there-
after The bank in this situation, the office at New
York was little better, and the office at Boston a
great deal worse At the same time the bank owed
to Barms, Bi others <%• Co , and Thomas Wilson <$•
Co , nearly $900,000, which it was bound to pay im-
mediately, and which was equivalent lo a charge
upon its vaults to that amount It had, including
the notes of the offices, a circulation of six millions
of dollars to meet, to which were to be added the
demands of depositors, public and private—at a
time, too, when the scarcity of money called forth
every disposable dollar, and therefore created de-
mands upon the bank for an unusual portion of the
ordinary deposites and circulation The sums
which were collected daily on account of the re-
venue, in branch paper, were demandable the next
day in Philadelphia, and at the same lime at every
office of the establishment, at the discretion of the
officers of the Government The reveuue was
principally paid in bumrh papei as v ell at Boston
and New Yoikas at Philadelphia, and while the
duties were thus paid it one counter, in branch pa-
per, the debentures, which amounted to one million
of dollars evtry three months, were demanded and
paid at the other, m specie or it  equivalent—money
of the place Many additional details, increasing
the difficulties of the moment, might be added The
southern offices were remitting tardily, and the
western not at iU All the resouices of the bank
would not have sustained it in this course and mode
of business anothei month '"
In 1828, there existed a money piessure, and on
the lOih April of that year, Mr Nicholas Biddle,
who had succeeded Mi Chevts as president of the
Bank of the United States, published an. essay in
the National Gazette
"The question is," said Mr Biddle, "what is the
cause and the nature of the present scarcity of
money'
"The answer is easy
"The currency of the United States consists of
com and of bank notes promising to pay com
As long as the banks can always pay the coin they
promise, they aie useful , because, in a country
where the moneyed capital is disproportioned to
the means of employing capital, the substitution of
credits for coins enables the nation to make its ex-
changes with less com, and of course saves the ex-
pense of thai com But this advantage has by its
side a great danger Banks are often directed by
needy persons, who borrow too much, or by san-
guine persons, anxious only to increase the profits,
without much pecuniary interest or personal re
sponsibihty m the administration     The constant
tendency of banks is, i/ierefore, to lend too much
and to put too many notes in circulation "              '
" Like the power of steam," Mr Biddle said
"a mixed currency is eminently useful m pru'
dent hands, but of tremendous hazard when not
controlled, and the practical wisdom m man-
aging it, lies in seizing the proper moment to ex-
pand and contract it—taking care, m working
with such explosive materials, whenever there is
doubt, to incline to the side of safety."
" Never," said the Frankfort (Kentucky) Argus
of June, 1819, "within the recollection of our
oldest citizens, has the aspect of the times, as it
respects property and money, been so alarming.
Ajready nas property been sacrificed m consider-
able quantities, in this and the neighboring coun-
ties, for less than half its value We have but
little money in circulation, and that little is daily
diminishing by the universal calls of the banks.
Neither lands, negroes, nor any other article, can
be sold for half their value in cash, while execu.
tions to the amount of many hundreds of thous-
ands of dollars are hanging over the heads of our
citizens    What can be done 1
A Kentuckian, writing in the Edwardsville (Il-
linois) Spectator, confirmed this gloomy account
" Look now," said he, "at Kentucky i What a
spectacle does she present • Nothing is to be seen
but a boundless expanse of desolation < Wealth
impoverished—enterprise checked—commerce at
a stand—the currency depreciated—all that was
indicative of State prosperity and advancement
plunged into the great vortex of irremediable in-
volvement "
In January, 1820, the Senate of Pennsylvania
appointed a committee (with Condy Raguet at its
head) to inquire into the causes and extent of the
public distress. In their report, the committee re-
ferí ed to "ruinous sacrifices of landed property
at sheriffs' sales"—" forced sales of merchandise,
household goods, farming stock and utensils, at
prices far below the cost of production"—"a gen-
eral scarcity of money throughout the countiy"—
"an almost entire cessation of the usual circulation
of commodities, and a consequent stagnation of
business"—"numeious lawsuits upon the dockets
of our courk"—"usurious extortions"—and "the
overflowing of our prisons with insolvent debtors '
&c.                                    «                                '
In June, 1822, Mr Niles íemarked that forty-
two merchants of Boston had stopped payment
within the period of a month, and on the 3d of
August, he made the following quotation from a
Salem paper " We regret to learn that failures
continue to take place almost daily at Boston
some of them of persons extensively engaged in
commerce We are informed that withm the last
U\ o months there have been more than eighty fail-
urcs in that ciiy The embarrassment, distress
and alarm, which such a state of things must ne-
cessauly produce, are indeed a serious calamity.
The amount of these failures, for the last txio
months," adds Mr Niles, "is said to be more than
th'i ee millions of dollars "
In bis speech m favor of the tariff, in the House
of Representatives, on the 30th March, 1824, Mr
Clay made the following remarks
" In casting our ejes around us, the most piom-
ment circumstance which fixes our attention, and
challenges our deepest regret, is the geneial dis-
tress which pervades the whole country ft v,
forced upon us by numerous facts of the most in-
contestable character It is indicated by the di-
minished exports of native produce, by the de-
pressed and reduced state of our foreign naviga-
tion, by our diminished commerce, by successive
unthreshed crops of gram, perishing in our barns
and barn-yards for the want of a market, by the
alaimmg diminution of the circulating medium,
by the numerous bankruptcies, not limited to the
trading classes, but extending to all orders of oo
aiety , by a uni\ ersal complaint of the want of em
ployment, and a consequent reduction of the wages
of labor, by the ravenous pursuit aftei public sit-
uations, not for the sake of their public duties, but
as a means of private subsistence, by the reluct-
ant resort to the perilous use of papei-money, by
intervention of legislation in the delicate relation
between debtor and creditor, and, above all, by
the low and depressed state of the value of almost
every description of the whole mass of the pro-
perty of the nation, which has on an average,
suntc not less than about fifty per cent within a few
yeats"
" In 1821," says Mr, Gouge, "the notes of th«
