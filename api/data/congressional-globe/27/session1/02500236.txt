He f aid the DiH p epised that the profus-shou'd

was, ous;ht the surplus to rceumulate ia the Bank
or in the Treasury of the Un.ted S ates? This mo-
ney belonsed to ¡he Government, as the chaunnn
of the committee had told them, and was to supply
the place of a b>nus, subj.ci to a mere contingen-

would recollect i ha i the Senator from New Yoik
[Mr. Wright] offered one o! the s-ame provision, a
lew dajs since. They were now at.acktna one of
the most valuable parKof the bill. For the firsi
time, in his knowletke, a restriction was placed on
the ban*. But the question atose, why should the
Government, owning only one-third, tike all t'is
profit? Ti'.ey ou?ht to allow this Bank to accumu-
late so much profit, and all ¡he surplus re?ultirg
from advantages given by the people throujh ihe.r
agents, ousht to n tmn to the,- . The Senator ob-

The queuion is, why should Hie stockholders have

in tee Bank as so much addt'ional caj ital. But it
belongs to the Government, and why should the
stockholders get two-thirds of tne dividend on it?

As he was anxious to have .he bill (ak<?n out of
enmroittee ihis evenin , he sh-uld be vi ry brief.
There was not one effioitnt restriction in this b'll,
such as banking experience would have dictated.
Toe CJpital should be ore to three of the. circula-
tion not only, but a'ni i f the depo-.i es—which in
this Bank would be much grea¡.r than i!i3 circula
tion.
Mr. CLAY of K weeky said he was rut prised
tha' ihe Senator had ssid the Bank was without rc-
Eincion. T-'e number of resric¡tons in the hill
the Sena'or had never conceived of. There were
more restrictions in this bill than in any exis'itig
bank he knew of. With regaid to the amendment,
its rredror and debtor cnculztion were alroi.'!y re-
s need How could they rcíuiate ihe crcolaiion
by this díilf and hourly tiuetuanon of d-pO'i'íV?
How conkl it b? known wh n a note -.vas tobe

He hoped the amendment wou'd not be adop'pd,
and tha! Senators would cease shingitng the b;ll
with amenr^ni! n*s.
M-. CUCHAN \N would m' vote for any bank
charter in his own Sla'c, whose capital v.as not to
he in proportion to its circulation and deposites,
l'his was Ihe touchstone of banking, and without

Mr. iniCíTON app- a'ed to hon not to underUks
any fuither the r-striction. In Enir'atd one-thtoi
was th" l-ast propottion cstiinfed safe, and he con-
b tided thi- was the least that should be maile. He
would throw the responsibility on the (.'¡ends of t'-e
bill, and as he knew the proposition, if made,
would be lest, he did not wish their voles recorded
as a™reein!  to any   less restrictions.
Mr. BUCHANAN said a piopnrtion of one to

di/lercd with hi.ii, he would not press H, as he
wanted to keep their little b.v.d unhid.

oth°r instances, to show tha neqrtahty resulting
i'rom the operations of the late Ban!; and nbich
it was the object of bis amendment to remedv.
He would content himself with a reference to one
more only.    It was Ihii: the curtailments made in
I  the  Western and Southwestern Branches alone,
!  between the 2d of August,   1833, and  th  3d of
March, 1834__a perhid ot   about seven  months—
had amounted $3 415.357 9S     Of this  amount,
near:y  $1000,000   had   been   drawn   from   the
Branch at New Orleans alone; and those curtail-
ments fell far short of what  was intended by the
board of directors ia   Philadelphia, and would no
I doubt have been executed, but for the spirit of op-
position   manifested by   some   of  the   Western
Branches.   What must have been the effect  on
the value of property, and the interest of the plant-
ers,  f>nnerí, and merchants, of ¡he South and
West, under a syst m so flictuatir.?, and so ex-
hausting?   Cou'd any one tail to perceive the inju-
l'  rioits effect, on Ike interest of all those daises, of
!    withdrawing from New Oi letns, and other points
¡I  in ihe val'ey o: the Mis;issippi id so short a tane,
l|  th"  v.-.st amount of. thrte and a half millions of
!¡  dollars; and this, too, at the very season when the
|  j;reat staple of the South, all  the products of that
' extensive and fertile region weregotng 'nto market?
1      Mr. C. said it was to prevent these flucluat'ons,
|  as far as possible—D guard against a concen'ra-
,  tion of all,  or nearly all, the lante capital of this
!|  powerful  institution,  noith of the Potomac—and
|¡  to insure something  like a fair distribution of its
0   benefits, if any were to result from it, that he had
11 proposed his amendment; and he hoped it wou'd
'    meet the favorable consideration of ihe Senate.
'.        Mr. CLAY of  It. ntue.ky  eaid   Ihe   proposition
|'   was, that ihe deposites  should  be   distributed  ac-
cndii.'S  to tee capital subscribed, n< r according to
¡    Ihe locali'y 0t' b.is-ness..    Why   dio.   they   ask  a
