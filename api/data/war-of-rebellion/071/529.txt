Colonel HAYWARD, Second Brigade:

The battalion of heavy artillery under command of Captain Pope has moved and will report to you to-day. General Hardin directs that you will concentrate the One hundred and fiftieth Ohio National Guard on the right of your line from Bunker Hill to Lincoln and distribute this battalion as you may deem best from Bunker Hill to the left of your line, strengthening each fort according to the necessities of the case. You can issue the order concentrating the One hundred and fiftieth at once, as this new battalion will report to you before night. It has just started. General Hardin will probably be out to see you to-day and give further instructions.

Very respectfully,R. CHANDLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

My line was back to Conrad's Ferry last night. By 12 noon to-day had it re-establish to mouth of Monocacy. Cheek's Ford, first above Monocacy, where Mosby crossed yesterday, is unguarded, leaving my right exposed. When eighteen of my men were fighting Mosby's whole command yesterday, I am informed Major Thompson was within supporting distance. My loss in that affair-prisoners, and about 25 horses and equipments captured.
