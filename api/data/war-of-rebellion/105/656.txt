MAJOR: It is recommended to me by officers who have served long on this coast, and in this section of the State, than San Pedro would be preferable to San Diego for the concentration of all the troops in this district for embarkation for the East. The troops from Fort Yuma can march to San Pedro in nearly the same time it would take to rach San Diego, and the company at San Diego can be brought to San Pedro without any expense to the Government. It is supposed that the steamer which may be employed would not go into San Diego without being well paid, and if we could concentrate all the troops in the district at one point it might be a saving of much expense to the Government.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel, U. S. Army, Commanding.
