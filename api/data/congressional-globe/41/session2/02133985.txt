AVarrant Division,
Treasury Department, May 4, 1S70.
This statement shows that the Treasury esti-
mates the revenue to be derived from customs
next year at $185,000,000, and that from inter-
nal revenue, without change in the laws, at
$175,000,000; that the estimated revenue from
lands will be $5,000,000, and from miscella-
neous sources, §28,000,000; making in all a
revenue of $393,000,000. By this document
the Treasury estimates the expenditures for
next year at §291.000,000. If the House suc-
ceeds iu keeping down appropriations as it
has done in the appropriation bills which so
far have passed, the expenditures will not be
«o large as that estimate. Probably they will
not exceed $275,000,000." But at any rate we
liave here a surplus of $102,000,000 over and
above the expenditures for all purposes what-
ever, taking the necessarily moderate estimates
which are furnished by the Treasury of the pro-
ducts of taxation; for, of course, they will
estimate their receipts as small as they hon-
estly can, while they will estimate the expend-
itures which they will be called upon to make
at such figure as will be sure to cover them.
We have, then, a surplus of $102,000,000 for
-the next year.
Now, what shall we do with that? A few
days ago I introduced a bill, in view of the
fact that it was not likely the House would get
at the tariff bill during this Congress. My prop-
osition was perhaps crude, but better than
non-action. It would be better to reduce the
duties oil imports discriminatingly, if time
would allow. But reduction is imperative, and
it would give no shock to the system or cause
any incongruity of working if the reduction
was regular and equal. I proposed to rcduce
the customs duties ten per cent, and the inter-
nal revenue taxes fifteen per cent., to take off
the income tax and abolish all the special taxes.
According to this paper from the Treasury De-
partment, which I had at that time, that will
leave a surplus of $22,400,000 per year. I
made *a calculation of what would be the effect
of properly applying that $22,400,000 every
year, and F find that by using it as a sinking
fund in thirty-four years we will have paid off
the whole debt, principal and interest, and on
the 30th June, 1004, have a balance left, after
41st Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 250.

This calculation makes no allowance for an
increase of the business of the country, for any
increase of its population and tax-paying power,
or for the fact that a reduced tariff will in many
instances produce more revenue. These figures
arc startling in their character. The chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means says that
he does not expect to live to see the time when
there will be no heavy taxation or no enormous
public debt. Why, at the rate we are going on,
applying $102,000,000 annually of surplus rev-
enue to extinguish the debt, it will be but a
very few years—he will far outlive the period—
before the national debt will be paid.
Now, we want some relief from taxation.
How shall we get it? The chairman of the
Committee of \Yavs and Means proposes by
this bill to take off $33,000,000 annually. L
would increase the reduction under this bill
to $60,000,000, by doing away with the in-
come lax, and after doing that we can spare
$14,000,000 more from customs. But here is
a tax which it is confessed touches everybody,
which goes into every place where any business
is done. Wherever a check is drawn the man
drawing it has to hunt up a two-cent stamp.
It touches hundreds of thousands of our busi-
ness people, who are continually irritated by
the necessity, sometimes the great inconven-
ience, of huuting up these stamps. And when
it produces only $4,000,000 I think we cannot
do better than add that $1,000,000 to the
$33,000,000 which this bill proposes to reduce
the taxes, and make the i eduction $34,000,000.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. HOTCHKISS. A word is due in reply
to the suggestions of thegentleman from Ohio,
[Mr. Sciikxck,] the chairman of the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, with regard to these
two-cent stamps. 1 do not believe there is
much divided opinion in this House with regard
to the policy and interest of the Republican
party ; but the chairman has one view and I
have another, or else we misunderstand one
another. I do not believe that it is necessary
that we should require this two-cent stamp upon
every instrument that is used of the character
named in this paragraph lor the benefit of the
Kepublican party. I do not think we can dam-
age the Kepublican party in any other way so
much as to keep the law as it now is. With
regard to the question of raising the amount of
revenue that is desired, i do not disagree with
the gentleman 5 I am willingtoincreasethetax
upon deeds, bonds, and mortgages, and those
instruments the execution of which is attended
with formalities, and where the tax is paid by
men of means. But I do not want to have a
tax placed where it creates the greatest irritation
and damages the party most to impose it.
Mr. STEVENSON. And which produces
the least.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. Yes; and produces the
least revenue. It is not pretended by any one
that a two-cent stamp upon bank checks is
going to produce half a million of revenue to
the country.
Mr. SCHENCK. It is over a million.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. How do you determine
that?
Mr. SCHENCK. I determine it in this way.
The whole amount of revenue stamps have
produced $1,055,000. That is upon small
orders, receipts, and bank checks, and there
is every reason to believe—the gentleman's
own observation will convince him of that—
that the two-cent bank checks yield by far the
largest portion of that $1,055,000. This does
not include the two-cent .stamps on proprietary
articles, but is confined to the regular revenue
stamps.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. The principle would not
be at all varied if this produced $5,000,000.
Mr. SCHENCK. It produces upward of a
million dollars now, as I understand.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. A million dollars can
be raised in no other way so injurious to the
■Republican party as by small stamps. And the
idea that the cry should now be raised of pav-
ing off the national debt and doing it by the
sale of revenue stamps, and have that done
solely at the expense of the-party in power, is
bad political policy and bad party policy.
