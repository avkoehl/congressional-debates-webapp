Brigadier-General NEGLEY:

Make arrangements to hold your position as you are. If your troops are too far advanced, draw them in a little. Keep out strong skirmishing parties, and be prepared to advance early to-morrow morning. General Thomas has gone to his camp, back 1 mile, but will see you in person before you advance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, December 30, 1862-1.30 p.m.

Major GEORGE E. FLYNT:

Colonel Starkweather, at 10.30 a.m. to-day, sent dispatch (just reached me) saying he was attacked in force, and it would not do to leave one regiment alone at Jefferson Crossing; it would be captured, and he awaited further orders; that a part of his train had been captured; that the enemy was reported 3,000 strong on the opposite side of the river, but that half that number was probably correct; that he had lost some men. Inclosed you have dispatch from General Rosecrans, in answer to which I inclosed Colonel Starkweather's report, deeming it necessary to give to him an immediate reply, with such information as I had; but my dispatch was directed to you or Colonel Garesche. If you receive it, will you please forward it to General Rosecrans, and I will make no further reply to him.

Very respectfully,LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
