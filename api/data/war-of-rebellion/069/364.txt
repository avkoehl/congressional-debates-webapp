PORT ROYAL, VA., May 30, 1864 - 8.15 p. m.

(Received 9.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Over 700 men - infantry, cavalry, and artillery - started this p. m. for White House. I fully expected to get 4,000 men off to the army to-day; but, owing to some of the steamers getting aground and breaking paddles, and the delay in towing them up, I was unable to start them. In all 7,500 men, new arrivals, detachments, convalescents, &amp; c., go to the army; also nearly 2,500 stragglers that I have collected. I will telegraph again before I leave, which, I expect, will be to-morrow.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: In consequence of the constant arrival of troops, subsistence stores, forage, & c., the pontoon train has been delayed. I had to depend on it solely for the debarkation of troops, unloading of stores, horses, & c., and loading of the wounded. Rafts had to be built to ferry the troops across the river to this place. Teams and drivers had to be taken from the Reserve Artillery to haul the boats and bridging. Then these teams had to be ferried across on rafts made of the pontoon boats. You will readily see that the delay has been unavoidable.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. ABERCROMBIE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have 6,140 men here, two-thirds of whom leave today for the army. This includes some 800 cavalry and a battery of artillery. The remainder go to you to-morrow, all according to your telegraphic order, by way of Hanovertown. To-morrow (May 31) everything will have been removed. I shall then leave for the White House. All unable to march will go by transport. Your brother is here, and will accompany me to the White House. I have collected from 1,500 to 2,000 stragglers, and between 500 and 600 contrabands. The stragglers go to their commands under guard, and the contrabands have gone to Washington.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. J. ABERCROMBIE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
