taken, and none will be. All the houses in which Lawrence goods have been found have been destroyed, as well as all the houses of known guerrillas, wherever our troops have gone. I intend to destroy the houses of all persons in the border counties, outside of military stations, who do not remove, in obedience to my last general order, by the 9th day of September next.

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

Reports reach me from Leavenworth that Major Anthony is endeavoring to get up an expedition into Missouri. Uncertain whether expedition is to cross the Missouri River or enter southern borders, I have notified Governor Carney, whom, I have reason to know, has done nothing to quiet the excitement, warning him that I would resist such an invasion of Missouri. I have notified General Guitar and commanding officer at Liberty, and ordered provost-marshal at Leavenworth to keep commanding officer at Weston advised. I do not apprehend serious trouble. My dispatch this morning should have read "150 horses."

Brigadier-General GUITAR,

Macon City, Mo.:

I am advised that an expedition is being fitted up at Leavenworth for a raid into Missouri. It is uncertain whether they intend to cross the river or attempt the lower border. I have notified the commanding officer at Liberty, and directed my provost-marshal at Leavenworth to keep the commanding officer at Weston advised. My troops at Fort Leavenworth cannot certainly be relied on in the present state of feeling. I have doubts whether any expedition of consequence will really set out, as I have given due warning that it will be resisted, but you had as well be ready.

Lieutenant-Colonel HILLER,

Cape Girardeau:

Has your detachment of the Pocahontas expedition returned? Colonel Woodson complains bitterly of the unsoldierly manner of many of Major Joslyn's command. He says they plundered and pillaged generally. You will make through inquiry into this complaint, and any property brought in by them, have turned over and properly accounted for. Thieves don't make good soldiers, and it is a shame that an achievement so praiseworthy as the capture of Jeff. Thompson should be shadowed by such gross conduct on the part of any soldier connected with the expedition. Jeff. is safe in Saint Louis.
