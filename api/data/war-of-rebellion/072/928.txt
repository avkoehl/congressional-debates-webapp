corps is passing us on the march for Red Oak on the railroad, and our column is to follow him. 8.30 a. m., General Kimball ordered to take ten ammunition wagons and General Newton seven. General Wood was ordered not to move until all of the trains have passed and all of the troops of our corps. 9 a. m., the head of General Davis' column (Fourteenth Corps) is just moving forward, having passed headquarters. He is moving on the direct road for Red Oak (on the railroad), which turns from the road on which we marched yesterday to the left a few hundred yards south of Mount Gilead Church. He has been having some skirmishing with the enemy's dismounted cavalry. 2.15 p .m., the rear of General Davis' corps has just passed, and General Kimball's division is starting on the march, following immediately after him. 2.40 p. m., arrive at the road that branches off to East Point, and, by direction of the general, General Kimball has sent a regiment out a short distance to watch any approach of the enemy that may be made from that direction while we are passing, the regiment to come in with the rear of our column. We are moving very slowly and stopping every five minutes on account of the slow movements and halts of the Fourteenth Corps in our front. The Fourteenth Corps reached the atlanta and West Point Railroad between 12 and 1 p. m., and are now moving over it, going into position, the line of battle facing Atlanta. 5.30 p. m., our head of column (General Kimball's division) arrived at a point about 300 yards from the railroad, between Red Oak Station and Red Oak Post-Office. We here joined with General Davis' left, his line of battle having just been formed. 7.30 p. m., the rear of General Wood's division has just arrived and gone into position. Our line of battle is now formed, facing Atlanta, and running above the road on which the troops marched this p. m., the right very near the railroad and the left in the direction of Mount Gilead Church. General Kimball's division is on the right, Newton's in the center, and General Wood's on the left. The enemy has not made his appearance to-day. Only a small-force of cavalry tried to oppose General Thomas, from headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi, dated in the field, Red Oak, Ga., August 28, 1864, 6.45 p.m.*

The foregoing instructions were inclosed in a note from Major-General Thomas to General Stanely, instructing him to send a division on the left of the railroad as far to the front as possible to destroy the track.

11.30 p. m., sent instructions to General Kimball to readjust his lines in the morning and to construct a strong barricade along his front. Same instructions sent to Generals Wood and Newton. Also directed General Kimball to order Colonel Taylor's brigade, of his division, to report to General Wood to-morrow for duty, to assist in destroying the railroad track. 11.45 p. m., sent General Wood copy of General Sherman's instructions in reference to destroying the railroad, and directed him to carry them out with two of his own brigades and Taylor's brigade, of Kimball's division, to throw forward this force on the left of the railroad as far to the front as possible and thoroughly destroy the railroad track; to take care that he be not suddenly attacked, and to take one battery with him; also to leave behind all pack-horses, mules, shelter-tents, &amp;c., so as to march as light as possible. Day very hot and clear.
