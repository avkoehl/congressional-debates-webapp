and ten last night (General McNair's Brigade). I am informed that they expressed their intention before coming here to desert when they got here. I fear that there will be many more unless some of these men are caught and shot. A lieutenant deserted who hat charges against him for disobedience of orders. He is a Yankee; gone to his brethren. He, of course, will give them all the information he has. It all arises from the [lack of] proper enforcement of discipline, so necessary to the utility of a command.

Respectfully,

W. H. T. WALKER.
