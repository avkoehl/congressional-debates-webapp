effective cavalry command in the West. I had hoped that General Hatch, as well as Colonel Winslow, would return to this point. I could then take into the field an effective force of 6,000 mounted men, and at the same time leave cavalry here for all practical purposes. With this force I could make the trip of which you speak through Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia with success and eminent advantage to the service. I would respectfully and earnestly request, general, the necessary orders from you to organize my command, including General Hatch's DIVISION, and that I may be permitted to lead into the field in person the troops with whom I have been identified as commander for the pat eighteen months.

I send Captain S. L. Woodward, of my staff, with this, and to see you in person. He can explain fully the condition of my command, and I wish through him to make some suggestions which I trust may meet your approval.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. H. GRIERSON.

Brigadier-General.
