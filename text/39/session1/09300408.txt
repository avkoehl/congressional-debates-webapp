and the said company cannot agree as to the
value of the premises taken, or to be taken,
for the use of said road, the value thereof shall
be determined by the appraisal of three disin-
terested commissioners, who may be appointed
upon application by either party to any. court
of record in any of the'Territories in which the
lands or premises to be- taken lie; and said
commissioners, in their assessment of damages,
shall appraise such premises at what would have
been the value thereof if the road had not been
built. And upon return into court of such ap-
praisement, and upon the payment into the
same of the estimated value of the premises
taken for the use and benefit of the owner
thereof, said premises shall be deemed to be
taken by said company, which shall thereby
acquire full title to the same for the purposes
aforesaid. And either party feeling aggrieved
at said appraisement may, within thirty days
after the same has been returned into court,
file an appeal therefrom, and demand a jury
of twelve men to estimate the damage sustained;
but such an appeal shall not interfere with the
rights of said company to enter upon the prem
ises taken, orto do any act necessary and proper
in the construction of its road. And said party
appealing shall give bonds,with sufficient surety
or sureties, for the payment of any cost that
may arise upon such appeal; and in case the
party appealing does not obtain a verdict more
favorable, such party shall pay the whole cost
incurred by the appellee, as well as his own,
and the payment into court, for the use of the
owner of said premises taken, at a sum equal
to that finally awarded, shall be held to vest in
said company the title of said land, and the
right to use and occupy the same for the con-
struction, maintenance, and operation of said
road. And in case any of the lands to be
taken as aforesaid shall be held by an infant,
femme covert, non compos, insane person, or
persons residing without the Territory within
which the lands to be taken lie, or persons
subjected to any legal disability, the court
inay appoint a guardian, for any party under
any disqualification, to appear in proper per-
son, who shall give bonds, with sufficient surety
or sureties, for the proper and faithful execu-
tion of his trust, and who may represent in
court the person disqualified, as aforesaid, from
appearing,_ when the same proceedings shall be
had in reference to the appraisement of the
premises to be taken for the use of said com-
pany, and with the same effect as has been
already described; and the title of the com-
pany to the lands taken by virtue of this act
shall not be affected or impaired by reason of
any failure by any guardian to discharge faith-
fully his trust. And in case any party shall
have a right or claim to any land for a term of
years, or any interest therein, in possession, re-
version, or remainder, the value of any such
estate, less than a fee-simple, shall be estimated
and determined in the manner hereinbefore set
forth. And in case it shall be necessary for
the company to enter upon any lands which
are unoccupied, and of which there is no ap-
parent owner or claimant, it may proceed to
take and use the same for the purposes of said
railroad, and may institute proceedings, in man-
ner described, for the purpose of ascertaining
the value of, and of acquiring a title to, the
same; but the judge of the court hearing said
suit shall determine the kinds of notice to be
yrvkd on sueh owner or owners, and he may
in his discretion appoint an agent or guardian
i.; represent sueh owner or owners in case of
lib or their incapacity or non appearance.
