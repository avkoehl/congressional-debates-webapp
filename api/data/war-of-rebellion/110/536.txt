HEADQUARTERS STATE TROOPS,Atlanta, Ga., October 4, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I inclose to you a correspondence between General Bragg and myself, which will inform you of the strength and disposition of the forces which I have organized from the State troops. As soon as I can obtain correct official reports I will forward to your office the muster-rolls and an account of the organization I have made. In the meantime I thought it would not be amiss to give the information contained in the inclosed correspondence.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours,

HOWELL COBB,

Major-General, Commanding, &amp;c.

[Inclosure Numbers 1.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Mission Ridge, September 27, 1863.

Major-General COBB,

Commanding, Atlanta, Ga.:

GENERAL: By General Bragg I am instructed to ask for the strength and the composition of your forces. He desires, if it be possible, that a sufficient force may be advanced from those holding Atlanta to guard and defend the depot of this army at the Chickamauga Depot, on the Atlanta and Chattanooga Railway. If, however, your forces is entirely composed of State troops unwilling to leave their own State, he can make their services more valuable in holding the strong position on the railway near Ringgold than in remaining at Atlanta. An early report is requested.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
