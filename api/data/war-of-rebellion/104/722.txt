making a most perfect success had not a most painful mistake occurred by which the Fourth Michigan and First Wisconsin collided, which cost us 2 men killed and Lieutenant Boutelle wounded through the arm, in the Fourth Michigan, and 3 men wounded in the First Wisconsin. This occurred just at daylight, after we had captured the camp, by the advance of the First Wisconsin not properly answering our challenge, by which they were mistaken for the enemy. I returned to this point last night. Shall move on to Macon without awaiting orders from you as directed, feeling that the whole object of the expedition is accomplished. It will take me at least three days to reach Macon. We are seventy-five miles out, and our stock much wearied. I hope to reach Hawkinsville to-night.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. D. PRITCHARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel Fourth Michigan Cavalry.
