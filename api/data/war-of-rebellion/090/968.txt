Major-General KELLEY:

Everything quiet this a. m. Men just from Martinsburg report things all quiet along line of road. General Averell is in Martinsburg with his command. Our forces had a slight skirmish near Winchester yesterday. If you think proper, I will run down as far as North Mountain to get in communication with General Averell, so I can keep you posted. Please answer.

Jim Short, of Imboden's command, was in Cumberland day before yesterday. Could it be our men/

Colonel HOY,

New Creek:

Keep your scouts active and on the alert. I think McNeill intends striking west instead of east of this point. He in all probability will go west of the Alleghany Mountains.
