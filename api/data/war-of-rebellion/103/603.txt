General E. H. HOBSON,

Lexington, Ky.:

GENERAL: I have reliable information from Rough and Ready, in Anderson County, of a fight between a detachment of Captain Brown's company of the Fifty-fourth and a gang of guerrillas under the notorious Dick Taylor, who was the leader of the gang that killed the negroes a few days since below Simpsonville. Lieutenant Moore and Taylor had a hand-to-hand fight. Moore received several cuts from a bowie knife in the face, and in the fight he shot Taylor dead. One other guerrilla was killed and the rest routed.

Very respectfully,

D. W. LINDSEY,

Inspector and Adjutant-General.

LEBANON, KY., January 28, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

About forty men passed [within] five miles of Campbellsville, camped three miles from here last night, crossed to Bradfordsville road and took Bradfordsville direction. Said they [were] Fourth Missouri Cavalry. I think they are rebels. I have no company of my regiment at this place.

MAHONEY,

Major Thirtieth Kentucky.
