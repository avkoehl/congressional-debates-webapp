GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 9. Danville, Va., April 27, 1865.

The major-general commanding desires to express his great gratification at the accomplished of the late march of the corps from Burkeville Junction. In four days and four hours not less than 100 miles have been traversed-a march almost unprecedented in this or any other war, even under the most favorable auspices. Without the incitement of anticipated victory; without the hope of soon meeting an enemy, or of adding aught of glory or renown to the already brilliant career of the corps, it is by the exhibition of such qualities as have been shown during the past few days-patience, endurance, fidelity-that the true soldier creates and sustains his own reputation and the pride and admiration of his commanders.
