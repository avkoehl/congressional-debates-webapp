HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,October 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received. I like the plan. I wish we had more forage on hand. The enemy having burned bridges across the Sweet Water indicates a winder sweep. I am yet loath to believe the Hood will throw his entire army across the Chattahoochee.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 1, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD:

Let two of your DIVISION more down the Newman road to or below Fairburn, driving and cavalry they may find, but not engage infantry or to go beyond that point. Send word to General Kilpatrick at Sweet Water that you have done so, that he may observe the effect. General Garrard will go over to Powder Springs and Dallas to-morrow.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The following just received:

MEMPHIS, September 28, 1864.

Forrest made a speech at Tupelo on the 16th, and told his men that he was going to Middle Tennessee, to operate on Sherman's communications, and promised that he would compel Sherman to evacuate Georgia within sixty days; also promised all the horses they wanted. On the 20th he was at Cherokee, near the Tennessee, with most of his command. He probably has about 5,000. A small force has crossed the Tennessee lower down. Staff officer from you has not arrived. The information in regard to Forrest is entirely reliable. You are aware, I suppose, that I am now weak. All the SIXTEENTH Corps have gone; the 100-days' men gone, and nearly half of my cavalry sent after Price and Shelby, and one regiment to Saint Louis.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military DIVISION of the Mississippi:

General Ransom moved out with two DIVISIONS this p. m. and is now in camp within eight miles of Fairburn; says in report: "The enemy intrenched near Shadna or Sideling, either infantry of cavalry, cannot learn. " Found enemy' cavalry pickets four miles out, who disappeared on his appearance.
