WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, March 21, 1863.

EDWARD M. CLARK, Esq., Richmond, Va.

SIR: Your letter of the 12th instant was referred to the Commissary-General who replies that it has been decided that paroled soldiers could have their rations commuted from the date of parole up to the period of exchange at the cost price of the ration. No communication is allowed during the time the soldier is in the hands of the enemy. The accounts for communication must be certified to by a commissioned officer cognizant of all the facts and dates.

Respectfully,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,March 21, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War.

SIR: I have received from General Hooker General Orders, Numbers 49, of General Halleck dated Washington, February 28, 1863, a copy of which I submit* herewith.

I would respectfully, call your attention to this order which in my judgment conflicts with the cartel for the exchange of prisoners and solicit such instructions with regard to it as you may deem requisite.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

[Indorsement.]

WAR DEPARTMENT, March 31, 1863.

Mr. Ould will please examine this and report wherein he thinks it violates the cartel.

J. A. S.

Secretary of War.
