General BRAGG,

Richmond:

General Hoke has only 40 rounds of ammunition. He has 11,000 muskets; 8,000 caliber Numbers .58, and 3,000 caliber Numbers .69. For full supply we need 360,000 caliber .58, and 180,000 caliber .69. Have you any orders? Send the ammunition by boat, and send wagons to me here by road, as Hoke has no train.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

According to orders from General Beauregard, I report that I, with six brigades, have formed a junction with General Ransom on the road leading from Petersburg to Richmond. The enemy have retreated upon Bermuda Hundred, either with the intention of leaving or crossing the James River. They have shown very little disposition to fight. The railroad to Petersburg is clear and can be easily repaired.
