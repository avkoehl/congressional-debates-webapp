HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, September 17, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My indorsement on paper of General Hunt, returned to-night, explains that I was ignorant of the direct charge of siege guns by General Hunt. I immediately revoked the order as to the two Parrott guns that I ordered moved from the rear, and entirely disclaim all desire of interfering with General Hunt's duties. I regret that I was not advised of the orders in the matter.

D. B. BIRNEY,Major-General.
