HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-12.20 p.m.

General GREGG:

General Hancock wishes, if it can be done properly, that General Miles now come in and protect the roads leading into General Birney's right and rear, while you hold strongly to the front. General Birney reports that he has carried the enemy's main line on his front, and wishes this protection to his right. The general commanding considers your reconnaissance complete if you can hold on where you are.

Your obedient servant,FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864-2 p.m.

General GREGG:

General Birney has captured 200 or 300 prisoners and 3 battle-flags. One general officer, supposed to be Girardey, is dead within our lines. Release Miles as soon as you can, and send him straight toward General Birney, holding pretty strong to your front. Since writing the above, your dispatch by Captain Brownson was received. If Miles becomes heavily engaged, of course his return is out of question until a proper time. A brigade of Colonel Broady has just gone on General Birney's right. You should see, by cavalry vedettes, that the road is open before Deep Creek and Birney always.

FRANCIS A. WALKER.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864.

General GREGG:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that unless you are very seriously engaged you must send General Miles toward General Birney by the shortest route, and dispute the Charles City road with your cavalry. General Birney is pretty heavily pressed on his right and left.

[FRANCIS A. WALKER,Assistant Adjutant-General.]

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 16, 1864-3.15 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

COLONEL: General Miles had gone to Birney's right and I am holding the north side of Deep Creek. Our last advance was met by a superior force of infantry, which moved up from the direction of Fussell's Mill; the force is now retiring to my left and in the direction of the mill. The firing in my front has ceased. I send to General Hancock the map which I found on General Chambliss' body. Please return it when the general is through with it.

Yours, respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
