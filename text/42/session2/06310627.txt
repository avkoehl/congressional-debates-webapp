THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
627
of this House, that this case reccully came to
us from the Pension Bureau. The reason why
this soldier was not granted a pension is this:
he was furloughed from general hospital. The
records of the War Department and Surgeon
General's department show that he was fur-
loughed, but it does not appear that it was a
sick furlough. They are strictly bound by
the records of the War Department. This
soldier was wounded while on picket duty at
Chattanooga, and was transferred to general
hospital in Indiana, and while convalescing
was permitted to go home ou furlough. While
on his way with other soldiers an accident
happened to the train, and a number of persons
were seriously injured. This soldier was on
the train. The Pension Bureau regard his case
as one of great merit. There is not a question
of doubt in reference to the equitable character
of the claim, butthis simple technicality estops
the Pension Bureau from granting tlie pension,
and hence the party comes here for lelief.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a thiid time 5 and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
NATXIAN MORGAN.
Mr. MOOHE also, from the same commit-
tee, reported a bill (IL It. No. 1211) granting
a pension to Nathan Morgan; which was read
a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior
to place on the pension-roll, subject to the
provisions and limitations of the pension laws,
the name of Nathan Morgan, late a private
in company I, of the fortieth regiment Iowa
volunteer infantry, to take effect from the pas-
sage of this act.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. M0011E moved to reconsider the vote
by which the hill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid 011 the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. MOO KB also, from the same commit-
tee, reported adversely on the papers in the

Mr. COBURN. I move that bill as a sub-
stitute for the report of the committee. The
applicant is the widow of Charles G. Loucks.
The SPEAKER. The Chair doubts the
gentleman's ability to do that under the rule.
The Chair would suggest thatthe proper course
to take, under parli.iia utaty law, would be to
move a recommittal of the report, with instruc-
tions to report a bill.
Mr. COBUR'N. I make that, motion.
