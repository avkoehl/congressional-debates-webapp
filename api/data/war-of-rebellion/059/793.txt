HDQRS. ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, April 18, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

GENERAL: I learn by a note from General Lee that Longstreet has transferred Law's brigade to Buckner, and left it at Bristol. This should be corrected by telegraph. As the charges against General Law are not sustained by the Department he should be restored to his command. Allow me to suggest early action on McLaw's case. He should be with his division. Allow me to suggest General Holmes for the duty of organizing and commanding the reserves in North Carolina. General Lee suggests the movement of Beauregard's surplus forces this way, to be ready to relieve Pickett, who should go to him. As the re-enforcements to the enemy in Florida seem really to have been the removal of the enemy from there, ought not our troops to come on to North Carolina, instead of again being buried in the district system in Georgia and South Carolina?
