JOHNSON, went into Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, (Mi Wani,iif New
York, in the chair,) on the bill to render perma-
nent the piesent mode of supplying the army of

The committee accordingly took up the bdl as

tne committee rose anu reported the bill to the
House
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed
ADDITIONAL PAYMASTERS AND ENGINEERS.
On motion of Mr R M JOHNSON, the
House again resolved itself into the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr Lytld
in the chair,) and took up and considered the
following bills
A bill respecting the appointment of three addi-
tional paymasters of the army, and
A bill to provide for the increase of the corps of
engineers
Mr R M JOHNSON moved a substitute to
the first section of this bill, proposing to increase
the corps
Mr SPEIGHT was opposed to the bill
Mr DUNLAP was opposed to any further in
crease bf the army, and ti usted the amendment
would be rejected
Mr R M JOHNSON appealed to gentlemen
to permit the bill to come into the House, when
he would give every necessary explanation that
might be deemed requisite
Mr LANE said hetrusted the motion to amend
would not be sustained by the committee Every
State m the Unión is interested in the increase
of the corps of topographical engineers They
are educated for the purpose, at the public ex-
pense Their services are devoted to the public
interest They areexpenenced, and their services
are called for daily and hourly at the department,
to superintend the survey of oi.r harbois, our
roads, and our canals The States required their
seivices to superintend their suiveys of internal
impiovements, authorised by the respective States,
and carried on with their own resources Also,
by private incorporated companies m every por
tion of the countiy, who are engaged in construct-
ing works of great public and local interest
That he had, at t'ie request of a railroad compa-
ny in Indiana, made application to thedepaitment
for an engineer without success, because they
were all on duty That the State of Indiana had
authorized several surveys of a public and national
character, with a view to a geneial system of
internal improvement within the State, to be car-
ried on with their own resources They have an
agent now m this city for the purpose of obtaining
an experienced engineer from the department
That the increase of this corps was, in his
opinion, called for by eveiy consideration of
National, State, and local interest
Mr R M JOHNSON withdrew the amend-
ment
Mi DUNLAP offered an amendment providing
for the repeal of all laws authorizing the appoint-
ment of topographical engineers
Mi D expressed his great surprise at the gen-
tleman from Indiana [Mr Lanf] supporting the
bill, but it was not uncommon to see gentlemen
elected as friends of the present Executive, and
when they came to that House they voted m favor
of every measuie of internal improvement by
the General Government Mr D wanted these
appointments and surveys confined to the States.
He called upon gentlemen to redeem their pledges,
and sustun the principles of the Administration,
which was assailed from every quarter of the
country, while that House would be leally to
blame He did hope that a House, with a Jack
son majority, wouldI not be found sustaining every
proposition opposed to the pi maples of the pres
ent Executne
Mr LANE said, in reply to the gentleman
fiom Tennessee, [Mr DraiAr,] that the House
had received a lesson of party discipline That a
large portion of it seemed to have been intended
for himself That it would have been wisdom in
the honorable gentleman if he had applied the
discipline to himself, before he should have in
strutted the House He says he is surprised that
the geptleman from Indiana and others who were
elected as Tackson men, and sent here to support
the principles of the Administration, should vote
foi these extiavagant appropriations for surveys
and foi woiksof internal improvement, that to
increase the corps of engineers was to authorize
unconstitutional improvements It was true he
(Mr L ) had been elected as a fuend of the dis
tmguisl ed Chief Magistrate, not to serve the Chief
Magistiate, but tosei vehis constituents, the State,
and the Union Tha' he wore no collar—no man's
yoke In his votes, and the course he had and
would pursue, while honored with a seat in this
House, he had and should follow the dictates of
his ow i conscience and judgment, uninfluenced
by any other consideration than the interest and
prospeuty of his constituents, the State, and the
Union The honorable gentleman fiom Tennes-
see [Mr Dunlap] may have been elected because
he was a Jackson man, to sustain the Admims-
tiation right or wrong If so, Mr L was proud
to say his selection was a different one That he
had been elected in a district whereGeneral Jack-
son hmis-elf had been beaten a few months before
He was willing to compare votes with the gen-
tleman from Tennessee, [Mr Dijklap,] and let
the House and the American peop'e determine
who had accorded to the Chief Magistrate the
most efficient support In the present instance,
he was sustaining the Chief Magistrate, while the
gentleman fiom Tennessee [Mr Dunlap] was
opposing him and his measuies The President
recommended it in his message, the Secieiary of
War requires it, it is emphatically an Admmis-
tiation measure A distinguished ofticer of one
of the bureaus is now in this Hall urging the
passage of this bill
He (Mr L ) was in favor of the General Gov-
ernment improving the condition of the country,
for the benefit of the people, with the money of
the people That he believed it not only consti-
tutional, but the duty of the General Government
to aid the States, and even private companies in
the surveys and prosecution of all woiks calcu-
lated to facilitate the commerce and interest of the
Union He had no constitutional scruples, nor did
he subscribe to the d ictrine that a stream, because
the water was salt, had the preference over a large
and commeicial channel of fresh water If the
gentleman means to be umleistood that to be a
Jackson man is to oppose all appropriations for
the improvements of out rivers and channels of
commerce, and all aid by the General Government
for improvements in the several State3, he could
only say no such Jackson men could be found in
Indiana
He (Mr L ) not only believed the General Gov-
ernment posseted the power, but that it was their
duty to lmpiove all their channels of commeice, m
every part of the Union That this principle had
been acted upon, so far as they participated in the
charactei of i ationol works 1 hat he understocd
these to be the principles of the Chief Magistrate
That he desires the passage of this bill mci easing
the corps of topograpical engineers, for the pur-
pose of aiding the nation, the States, and compi-
mes, in the prosecution of works of internal im-
provement
Mr BOON said he was a*are that the remarks,
which had just been made by his friend from Ten-
nessee, [Mr Duñlap,] were not directed to him
individually, but as he [Mr Boon] should vote
for the amendment offered by the gentleman fiom
Kentucky, and for the bill itself, he was not, there-
fore, to be considered as being inconsistent in his
couise toward the Administration Mr B said
that no one, perhaps, had been more uncompro-
mising in "his support of the present Chief Mag's
trate in three several elections, than himself, and
that few, if any, had given a more hearty and
uniform support of the general policy of the pres-
ent Admimstiation than he had done during the
time he had been honored with a seat in Con-
gress, and that while he hod given his support to
the leading measures of the Administration, he
had also taken the liberty, on some occasions to
go a scruple further in lelation to some matters
involving a mere difference of opinion
Mr DU.NLAP then withdrew his amendment
On motion of Mr R M JOHNSON, the com-
mittee rose, and reported the bill to the House
The bill to provide additional paymasters, then
came up on its engrossment
Mr JOHNSON gave a brief explanation of the
merits of the bi'l
Mi   SPEIGHT opposed the bill
Mr BURGES moved a proviso to the first sec-
tion, giving the Presidentthe power of appointing
the additional paymasters, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate
Agreed to
Some conversation ensued between Messrs
POLK, MERCER, GRENNELL, and R M
JOHNSON, on some of the provisions of the bill
Mr CHILTOIN opposed the bill with much
earnestness, and called upon the friends of reform
and economy to vote against a proposition for the
creation of a new source of expense
Mr WISE maintained that the bill was in
direct violation of the principles of the Constitu-
tion, since it vested the appointing power in an
officer not recognised in that instrument He there-
fore moved to strike out the third section of the
bill, providing for the employment of citizens when
soldiers could not be engaged.
Agreed to
