Major-General CRAWFORD,

General Bragg telegraphs that he has sixty-six unarmed men in his old camp, a detachment of pioneers at division headquarters, 155 men and 4 officers on picket near Hatcher's Run, and odd men, with number scattered through division and corps. All except those belonging to the Sixth and Seventh Wisconsin Volunteers should be sent forward. General Bragg is directed to send the Sixth and Seventh Wisconsin Volunteers back, and to await the arrival at City Point of the other men.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 11, 1865-9.40 p. m.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All the detailed [men] of Bragg's brigade, except employees of the quartermaster and commissary departments, will report at Warren's Station to-night. The pickets reported shortly after noon to-day. If Bragg's brigade may not return, I earnestly desire to retain the Twenty-fourth Michigan, with the Sixth and Seventh Wisconsin. I have a surplus of regiments which can much better be spared from this army, and I especially desire to call the attention of General Meade to the subject. The three regiments mentioned have served together from the beginning of the war, and are identified with the Army of the Potomac. They desire to remain, and I ask the privilege of sending other reduced regiments in their place. All detailed men from the quartermaster and commissary departments belonging to the regiments now leaving will be placed under charge of an officer and ready to leave by 11 o'clock to-morrow.

Please reply to Second Corps headquarters.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brevet Major-General.

Brevet Major-General.
