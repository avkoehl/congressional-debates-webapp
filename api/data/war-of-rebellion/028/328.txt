BALTIMORE, MD., September 18, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

In consequence of the very large amount of transportation for Harristurg over the Cumberland Valley Railroad, exceeding, I fear, the capacity of the road, I have arranged, with the approval of General Wool, Colonel Belger, and President Garrett, that all troops and supplies from Baltimore and points south thereof shall be sent over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I have also ordered our bridge force from Alexandria to proceed to-night to re-enforce the party engaged in the reconstruction of the Monocacy Bridge.

F. H. PEIRPOINT,

Governor of Virginia.
