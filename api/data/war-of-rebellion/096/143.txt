WASHINGTON, D. C., January 15, 1865.

Major-General CROOK,

Cumberland:

It is expected that within a few days a part, at least, of General Schofield's corps will arrive at Parkesburg for transportation over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Annapolis. You will be prepared to have guards at all rations to prevent desertions, and you will close all grog shops in the places through which they pass. I shall probably be able to notify you more definitely of the time of their passage through your detachment.
