of '37    The fact stands admitted, re| eite llj admitted, boasted

Now to tne  testimony     1 read from the messige of th
President m\J,   Audit may be asserted withconfi'ence that
the necessarty t-anslers, as,weU as the safekeeping and d sbur-e

accomplished through Use agency of treasury oficers       T  is

mudes of keeping the public money, t > wit a national iiank,

to return to the evide ce upon the point I was discussing    I   |
read from the annual message ol 38     ' With tneexcepti n ol   i
limned sums,  deposited with tue  few banks  still employed     |
under the act of '36, the amounts received  liomdui s, and,   ||

with a short extract from the annual I    « ageof 38, clothe 1 in

No, sir, no The heartrending petitions of five hundred

tricable bankiupcy, would be conclusive of itself, in tha

Well sir, this is an important írquirj—an inquiry intimately,
inseparably, connected with a correct un lerstanding and dis
position ol the bill under decusson Theie is an awful
responsibi ity somewhere The indisputab e condition ofour
fminces and our country being as I have described it—must it
not be conceded by all candid men, that the exts ing state of
things is most extraordinary! Nj domes ic or foreign war
for twent) eight yeais—no public debt vvl en this \dminislra.
tion came into power, requinns an opj ressiv e scheme of taxa-
tion—but upon the contiary, a lafe surplus No pestilence—
in famine—no sudden withdrawal of the oulinar/ blessings of
Heaven, but, in the admitted language of the President—' as if
Pi iv iderce interded to display the murificence of its goodness,
atthemom nt of oui greatest n^ed and in direct conttast to
the evils accuior^d by the waywaidness of man, we have
been blessed thoughojt our exten led territory, with
seasi ns of general health and uncommon frmtfulnes , ' with
"domestic trmquillity and all the elements of prosperity"
abounding Why is it, then we are a distressed people' Why
is it that embarrassment public and pnv ate pen ades, that land
from one extremity to the t ther—East—\\ e- —Nortl and South
—leaving no green spot, no oasis of prosperity, upon which
for one moment to rest the wearied eye, oi elieve the bleeding
heart in the mournful contempiatien of unversal wo anil
misery1! Why is it that the present Administiation, assuming
the reigns of Government—with admission of uninterrupted
prosperity—with an undisputed surplus of twenty four millions
of dollars in our Na lonal Treasury—new the surplus ex
hausted, a national debt of five milliois already created al an
interest of five per cent, besides incidental expenses, with a
certai ity, amounting to demonstratitn, tl at fromfivf to ten
millions mor debt will have to be au horized before adjourn-
ment— the Gover ment tha'a heavy borrower—the Treasury
practically bankiupt? %Vhy is it one hall ofour lanks are
su pendid—the countrv disoidered—exchai ges ruinously un-
equal and oppressive, the worst of all blights to a nation's
prosperity public or private? ¡sir, it is impossible to impose,
any 1 niei upon the credulity of thcleast n formed, and induce
the I lief, tl a this is all the result of either accident or chance
—theunavo dable revulsions of commerce—or th t it is a' con

caí s a radical cause somewhere commensurate with the
desolating clfti t But I have 1 eard it said, upon this fljor in

statesman to stop to mquire into the cau es ol distress when
