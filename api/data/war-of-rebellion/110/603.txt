(Via Russellville.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

A report is here, said to be from a reliable person, that General Vance, with 100 of his men, were captured near Sevierville on the 14th. He advised me on the 10th of this month in that direction. As our parties in Sevier County sent to co-operate with him have no reported his capture, I hope that it may not be true.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.

A part of Martin's cavalry is a part of the sharpshooters of Hood's division. Brigadier-General Jenkins' command had a successful affair near Dandridge yesterday. We were getting into position, but the enemy returned during the night. It is supposed that he was attempting to turn our left.

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
