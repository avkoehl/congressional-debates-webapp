Brigadier General J. L. BEVERIDGE,

Cape Girardeau, Mo.:

I learn to-night that Jeff. Thompson is at Harrisburg, but have not learned his force. Kitchen is near Gainesville with a scattered force of about 200. Bolin is between Clarktown and Kennett with about 100. It appears that they are plundering the citizens there in general. This information is not from any of my scouts. I expect some of them in to-night or in the morning. They are about Jonesborough and Chalk Bluff. Saint Francis 100 yards wide and swimming.

ED. COLBERT,

Captain, Commanding Post.
