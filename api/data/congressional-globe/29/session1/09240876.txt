CIVIL AND DIPLOMATIC APPROPRIATIONS.
On motion of Mr. McKAY, the House resolved^
itself into Committer of the Whole on the state of
the Union, (Mr. Hormxs, of Virginia, iv\ the
chair,) and resumed the consideiation of the bill
making appropriations for the ci\il and diplomatic
i'i' do\ontmcnt foi the year ending the
oUta da v of June, 1S-17, and for other purposes.
The pending question was on agreeing to the
first clause of the amendment of Mr. Bell, which
is m Use following words:
"That the pay and emoluments of all the offi-
cers of the Inderal (Government in the civil depart-
ments, including tluit ot members of Congress,
e.M'epihi" such ortWis, however, whose pay and
omotunKms cannot constitutionally be reduced
dutii"4 tlicit term of service, be and the same is
her *by reduced :J,"> per centum fiom and after the
1st of Juno next, the reduction to continue so long
as the Mi'Xkan war continues."
And it was rejected.
The question jecurrina: on the second clause of
the tMiti amendment, to wit:
*• And that from the commencement to the con-
clusion ofsaid war the pay of the volunteer sokheis
of the American aiiny be ten do'hus per month,
instead of that now allowed by law;"
iVlr. McKAY raised the question of order. IJc
submitted that such an amendment had been olfeivd
some time nuro, and had been dceided out of order.
The CUAIHMAN was not aware (he was un-
derstood to say) that a similar amendment had
been introduced. The Chair ruled, however, that
the amendment was in order, on the ground that
the ^encial law piovidim; foi the payment of\ol-
untci rs was mi fin lent authoiity under the rule.
Air. McKAY appealed from the decision.
And the question, "Shall the decision of (he
Chair stand as the judgment of the committee'"
was taken, and decided in the negative.
Ho the decision of the Chair was nrirsed.
A nd the second branch of the amendment of Mr.
Bi.u. was not rniert.lined.
Mr. IIUODHKA1) olfered the following as an
additional section to the bill, hut withdrew it on an
imimation from the Clerk of the House, (B. B.
f'Veneh, Esq., through the Speaker,) (hat such
was already the existing law.
if. hid be it farther riutclrd> That it shall bo the
duty of the Cleik of the House of Ueprcsentutiv es
mid of (he Ht oeiai y of the Senate, m the purchase i
of slat louary or other articles for the use of either j
Mou^'e, to purchase the .same of Amen'an manu-
facture, in all easts, if the same can be, so pin-
ch >.-vcd as advanut^eously its the mamifaetuios of
other countries."
Mr. STEWART offered the following amend-
ment;
"That each private in a volunUor company,
who has or who slu-11 h<ivafter volunteer to i-ervo
in the ainiy of the United States, shall receive * i0
per month, ami those volunteers wlio serve to the
ond of the war against Mexico n1u\I1 receive Jt 0
.tries of land, and the heirs of those who volunteer
it) M'lVi lo the end of the war, and who shall die
in f lie >er\ K'e of the i rmted Stait s dunmr the w ar,
shall tecejve the lb') acrcsoi land, as the soldier
would have done, if he had lived and sei ved lo the
end of On: war. ''
Mr. GENTRY su^estcd to Mr. Rtewmvi- to
jneludo regulars as well as volunteers, and no! to
make a disciimmation between them. The rejr-
ulais had fought too well to admit of any such
discrimination aae'iasl them.
Mr. STEWART at fa hi accepted the su^os-
tion, and made the corresponding modification, but
subsequently withdrew it.
After some conversation,
The CHAIRMAN uiled the amendment out of
Older.
Mr. STEWART appealed from the decision.
The committee a[firmed the decision of 'he Chair.
So the amendment was not entertained.
On motion of Mr. McKAY, the committee then
rose, and reported the bill and amendments to the
House.
Mr. G. W. JONES moved to amend the bill by
striking out (he said) so much as related to the
Storm King.
The item in the bill read as follows:
"For compensation of the clerk and meteorolo-
gist in the office of the surgeon general, $3,000.n
Mr. JONES now moved to strike out the words
"and meteorologist,M and to reducetlie appropria-
tion from 13,000 to $1,000; [i. e. striking out the
amount of the meteorologist's salary.J
And Mr. J. demanded the previous question.
Some conversation followed on points of order,
in which Messrs. WINTHROP, J.-Q, ADAMS,
McHENRY, and the SPEAKER, participated.
And Mr. McHENRY appealed from a decision
of the Speaker, that it was-competent for a mem-
ber to Sffcr an amendment before the amendments
from the committee wore disposed of, though such
amendment was not an amendment to any one re-
ported from the committee.
The House affirmed the decision of the Chair,
The demand for the previous question was then
seconded. And the main question (first, on the
amendments, and then on ordering the bill to a
third reading) was ordered to be now taken.
The amendments wore rend, and such of them
as are not herein particularly mentioned, were
concurred in without adnision.
On concurring in the aniendmont of the commit-
tee sinking out the following item:
" For compensation of two keepers of the pub-
lic archives in Florida, ^1,000."
Mr. I>ROPKION 1JROUGH asked the yeas and
nays-, which were refused.
And the quest ion being taken, the vote stood—
ayes 93, noes 3d.
So the item was stricken out.
On concurring* in the following amendment of
the committee:
44 To supply deficiencies in the fund for sick and
disabled semm n, &S35,000. "

So the amendment was concurred in.
On concurring with the committee in striking
out the following item, to wit:
k* For the cerlem and eonM'k'iion of til""1 marine hospital
at i'ittslum:, Ijouisvilic, and (Jleveland, .•j'jOjODO."
Mr. BlUi^KFJillOh'F asked the yeas and nays;
winch were ordered.
[Note.—This item had been amended in com-
mittee by the insertion of the words "l^adueah"
and " Natchez;" and as thus amended, it had Sub-
sequently been stricken out.]
Mr. BOYD inquired of the Speaker whether, if
the. House should refuse to concur with the com-
mute o in striking out the item, the effect would not
be to brim* the House to a vote on the item, as it
hud been amended by the insertion of Paducah, &e.?
The SPKAICFR replied that the original item in
the bill would then stand. The House could know
nothing of the amendment made in committee, and
could only take the report of the committee, which
was that the item had been stricken out. Beyond
that there was no further question.
The question was then taken, and resulted as
follows:
