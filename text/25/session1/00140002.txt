When the State of MISSISSIPPI was called—
Mr MERCER rose and remarked that he should
not have asked the attention ol the House till it was
so fn organ /cd as to act, but that he perceived
hey had armed at that point wmch required of
him to propound an inquny to the t'vo highly ho-
norable and respectable gentlemen fiom Missis p-
p', an mquirj he knew the) would icspond to with
candoi, and, he hoped, sitisfacto fy to the Hous,.
Mr M then made a statement oí what he under-
stood to be the fact*, m regard io the late election m
Mississippi, and asked if tnose fact0, 01 anj part
of them, weie true or not
Mr GHOLSON had no dii[ osition to make any
reply en tins subject till the Hous was oiBani/ed,
when he should be prepared tu answer an) and
tveij intulegatory any gentleman might leel dis-
posed to propound The facto were briefh these
that the Governor of Mississippi had is<=ied his
proclamition for an election, is the law authorized
him to do, an election wis held undent, and he
and his he noi able colleague w eie theie present, thei1-
nght to then seats hivin*bcen questioned by vuy
lew mdividuils of either pailv of then State
Indeed it was not until fiftei the election wasovei,
and the lcsul ascertained,thai any question wis made
of it, and Irom the best infoimation he had the
question it-ell had originated not in the Stan ot Mis-
sissippi, but elsewhere lie (Mr G ) isi tul now-
ever, thai this question could not be entertained till
the House wis oigtni/ed, but whenever it was,
and the House was prepared to act upon d t case,
he should be preuaieri to meet il, foi he had no
wish to take his seat in «i body ol which he was not
constitutionally a membti Hi add< d that under
the Governor's proclamaton, fifty-fiye out ol the
fifty- six counties had voted
Mi MCRCER made a bnti explanation, and
advcilid, as another reason for his having pro-
pounded the question, to the failuvc ol his
cfbititi the last Congres? to procure an amend-
ment of that branch < Í the rules relating to the
snl "t of contested election-,, and th it, if the} nro-

Allot one further remaiks on tlvs subject Mr
M exptessed himself not satisfied by the statement
ol the gu iiien an doro Mississippi, and he moved a
leso'ution to the cilect lint sufficient evidence hi 1
n h been offered to show that Mcssis CL YIBORNE
and GUOLSjO'V weic entitled to their seats
Mr CLA1BORINL rose, he said, debilitated as
hi was not crop)} to the gentleman from Vn-
ginn, ten he would not, at tnat time, sufTci himsjf
to be dirtwn into any argument upon that subject,
but he ii e u piotes't, m the mmt oí the people ol
Miwssipp «-.ainstd step which he cenouncedas
hir.n-lniided, arbilraiy, and unprecedented, tot he
de'ibtiitclj asserted, that the gentleman from Vu
gmia ha 1 no írinie l ght to question his title to a
se it i ¡ on .it llooi, than he had to question the
r "fit oi tl it gentleman oi any other He insisted
that th t\ s ml in organized body until aSpeakei
had b"CT e'ecte I Until then they had no exis-
tence whi ever is a bod}, bin were a meie isso-
e ation ot i du duite, chiming to tepiesent ihe
people of the respective States- His collmgue and
himself appeared there, and their appearance was
pnmafacie evidence of th"ir right to represent the
people of the State whence they came He re-
peated, that he would not reply to the gentleman
H m Virginia, or to any other gentleman who would
e  leavor, at the threshhold, to exclude him from his
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
i igl Is   He cam" there to represent the people c f h's
State, aid 1 ad wen sent theie by th" oven helming
vo ce of that people, expressed und r the authority
of the Constitution  and law s of the Sta'e, and
undei  the authontv of the Federal Constitution
also    Although Mr C   would not undertake to
pronounce an eulogj upon the Governor of Mis-
sissippi, who was the leader of the paity to which
he w as opposed, yet he « ould say that that gentle-
man was a mm of high character, and was mca-
ble of doing what had been ascribed to him Mr C
looked upon  it as   an insult, not alone   to   tne
party that elected him.   and his colleague,   but
to all parties ef the fotate, to the whole pople
of Mtssssippi, to venture thus to dispose cf  then
rights lefore. 'hey hid  the  piwerto  do so     If,
however,   it   wis  p=rsistee'   m,   he   should   feel
himself compelled to cht'Iei f" every member fiom
Mane, to Mississippi io produce then credent aK
and he -hould object to any man's taking  bis seat
there tdl he and his colleague obUu cd then lights
Mi   C  would tnrownout  no imputations but, if
a^suled,   he   would  say   he   was   prepared   to
can}'    the    wai    into   Afnca       He  was   also
piep-ued to «ay where this opposition oi guiatcs
though it now came fiom a eliffeienl imartcr     He
wou'el   ay thatno man had been n ore dis-posed to
a corcniatoiy   couis-e   th n himself, but he woulel
not be singled out as the i lclim theie by a soil ol
polmcil  ostracism     If tney  v íshrd to dine him
