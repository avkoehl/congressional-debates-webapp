Tha p~ówer (o inquire into crimes of private individuals, even
against the laws and treaties oí the United totates, exists in every
branch of the Government "
Sir, I might go on, and read pages of argument like this, Out
ofwhatavailisit? None, none whatever To prove the gen
tlemaa inconsistent, would be a wotk of supererogation he
proves that daily, fo show he is now defending what he for
merly denounced, wouH be idle he has shown it himself I
read one more extract, for the sake of gratifying a portion of
those to "whom he seems d spo-ed to Imfc his political fortunes,
but who—cruel men—will not have him He ie> ¡speaking of
General Jackson
"Hereit might well be solemnly asked, if his ambition had
not lately been sufficiently glutted wuh humbling the Senate to
the desecration of its own inviolable records for his sake, not to
have been insatiable in seeking to subdue, also, the other House
of Congress, which is peculiarly the house of the people, and
■which for years has, m too many instances, been more than in
dulgent to his will? In the name of the country, he might have
spared some check upon the will, and not left all a wreck—a
sacrifice at the shrme of one man'"
I do not quite know, sir, what is meant by "sparing some
cheek on his will" Bat this is enough We are not, thank
Heaven, driven to the necessity ofiBafcing such appeals in these
times There maybe impediments thrown in our way an ass
resting on a railroad may overthrow a locomotive, cars pas
sengers, and all, but our present "highborn" Virginia Piesi
dent will never either 'humble the Senate" or   'subdue the
0 drier House "
I will not go through thisdisagieeable detail, it is as unpleas t
ant to me as to any other member of the House But I refer
to the proceedings of this and oí all other investigating eommit
tees—especially to this—especially to the conduct of the gentle
man himself He dogged the Secretary of the Tieasury, the
Secretary of State, the Postmaster General, and I think others,
and examined them Many of his questions were voted down
one, I remember, his own Whig frietds on the committee
against hmi—he solitary (delicate) and alone' Sir, I said Mr
Whitney had been bull dogged with a vengeance befoje the
committee The gentleman undertook, with an affectation of
great regard foran absent friend, to defend Mr Peyton fcir, I
never assailed Mr. Peyten I had forgotten, at the ume, he was
on the committee, and. what 1 said on that subject referí ed en
ttrely to the gentleman huns elf I referred to the statement
of Mr Whitney, or to the speech of the gentleman himsel t, in
which he "interposed m a friendly manner," when he said, "if
that arm had moved an inch, he (Whitney) should have died
upon the spot '*
Mr WISE then replied that, m a former debate, he (Mr
Wise) had said thjtt aftei the calls which the House had made
upon the Secretary of the Treasuiy for the reports oí the com
missioned, the powers of the committee over the subject
ceased—the committee wasfu?ictus officio--and the committee
—he had not said any membei of it—the committee had no
power or business to be doggmg a.1 the heels of the depaitment
to know why it had not answere i the callsof the Uoumi, whit h
had taken the tall out of the hands of the committee That u
was in reply to ttm, Mr ¡manly had u«ed the r« mar*, that
Whitney ha I been "bull dogged," and m answer to this lemaik,
he(Mr Wise) had íemmded the House that it was before the
Garland committee, and not before the. committee of which
he (Mr Wise) was the chairman, that the scene with
UeunenM Whitney occurred, that Mr Peyton was the mem
ber involved in that scene It was he who was msultul, and
who resented the insult, and not Mi Wit,s himsel í, and no one
who knew the facta would ¡suppose otherwise than that it wis
Mr Peyton who was alluded to by Mi Stanly s lemark
He (Mr Wisf) theieiore again asked Mr Stani y whether he
(Mr Stanly) meant to say that ht, (>ii Wisl) hid ever " bull
dogged" Reuben M Whitney
Mr STANIY I say aguri, distinctly, ímade the reply about
bull do¿gmg for the gentleman Horn Virginia, and intended it
for him and him alone—let him tal e it
Mr WISC then said, "air the mswei. to my question is just
such a one as I expected to obtain from a coward, ' and point
ing his finger dnectly at Mr Stanly, added, " who uoft standi
before me "
Mr SPaNIA Mr speaker, I am awateofthat I expected
all that I have seen him pursue that plan before It, is an old
trick This seat will testify who wag 'icowml" at ti e exn i
session, we all know who got the woist of that I ft the gentle
man try me, he shall see who is a cow ml He has mit.t iken
his man. I was not boin yes ei day ] know his tinwonhy
arts to get the advantage, but he will not succeed Isai I, de
hbeiately, he had acted like a bull dog to an unarmed, defence
less man, as Mi Whitney was
But here [quit tins repon, m which there  much to approve
and mueh to condemn, and recommend membeis of the House,
if they wish to see a delicate investigation, in which President
Heads of Departments, Senators, iviembeis of the House and
private individuals weie bull dodged—-or fice docged, if' the
gentleman pleases—let them look at the repoi t of the mvesti
gating committee, 2d se&smn 24th Congress, Tso 191
I wish now, sir, to examine the eiammatical letter of Mi
Tyler to Mr Pomdexter    Neie it is

nothing to do with it [that i", 'Executive action,' as the gen

I have, for a considerable time, most anuoutdy desired the

I shall deem it best to communicate the enure report to Con

mendations, and urging them upon the deliberation of Con
gress, will be for my own decision, as also will be the time
and occasion for making it, [that is, his decision—not ma
king it public "]
What nonsense the gentleman would make out of the Pres
ident's letter, if his 'grammatical" construction is adopted
throughout the whole1 If the gentleman could have seen the
smile on the counienanceof eveiy member who heard his ex
planation, he would have blushed I might take some sen
tences of his own speech, and, according to his grammar,
which he taught the honorable gentleman from Massachusetts,
how would he appear? The gentleman says "He, Mr P must
well know the course of the committee to be an abu*e, and if
now on the floor of the Senate, wou d be the last man ¿o justify
it " Does it mean the abuse, or the Senateí According to t e
gentleman's i ule—the Senate Take another example i  this
same paper * He believed the New "S ork custom house was a
caneei on the country, and he wished V probed to the core, and
all the cmrupt and mitating matter ren-oved " Now, does
it mean custom house, cancer or country? The custom house,
the cancer, surely, but accoi ding to the gentleman s own rule
thecountry mu3t be probed to thecore ' Yes it must be probed
to let out all thecoirupt and irritating matter' Would toGod
it could be ' It could be removed by taking off a single cap
tain s head     (I mean politically of course )
But suppose the gentleman is right in stultifying Mr Tylei,
what does he gain by his construction? l)oes he mean to say
that Congiesshas nothing to do with the Executive action
upon ihit  subject? I thought Congress had something todo
with allExecutiveaction, in some stageoi other The gentle
man spoke hastii), he must explain hisownexpiessions, or be
guilty of cl liming powei lor the President which would make
a man of talen , eneigy, and management, a master of the peo
pie
The gentleman asked if that report had evei been read by the
committee I answer, I lead it more caret idly, with more at
tention than I have read any rtport made by the committee
during this session The committee had the leport before them,
were infoimed oí its contents, and agieed to report it to the
House All the membeis did not read n, nor do all the mem
beis of any committee read all the reports, they would do little
business if they did The leport was in possession of the com
mittee six days, I think Now, the gentleman is answered on
that point He was mistaken m the eilencc to which he le
fei red
I wish to pay heie, sn, that I did not intend, in any remaik
made in the íepoit I submitted, to censjre the Secretaiy of the
treasury li such an mfeierce is deducible, I lepeat, it was
not intended to censure him I know him slightly, but all
speak well of him
\ I wish ako to say that my de¡ n e in bi ing'ng this report to the
House, w is not only to erial le them to expose the criminal con
duct of Hoytand Fuller, but to bring the whole truth to the
eon ni i y Some lew of the cow boys were m possession of some
of the I wis contained in the repoi t, retailing them ¿tub. n pleas
me, and thin injuring whom they pleased, and protecting whom
they pleased
Ihe people pay the expense Let them see and know the
misconduct of their public officers Let Congress, by timely
legisl ition, pie vent the recuirence of sach abu&es
And now, sir I have but a few more woids to say The

the House to send for peibone and papers, and believing that

«onal in hK remark*    [Roars of laughter Ions: continued ]
Mr STANLY «ail that the com mitt °p contained no one who
ha-i any resemblance to a cur, who spe-ns to po^e^s all the bad
tiatts without any of the good iuahiiesofthedog, who would
snap at the hand that fed him   who, because ho is caressed by
the possessors of power accidentally obtained, fawns and wag;
his tail at them, and growls and snaps at everybody else.
The gentleman seemed to take pride m being compared to a-
bull dog bir, he is welcome to all the honor I am willing t&
admit that he may be an admirable creature in canine feat*,
whether he plays the part of bull dog, blood hound, or cuy. I
am wilhng to admit in all performances he is much more of a
dog than I am I will nevei be iound playing the pan of audi
an animal to please any master And supposing there exisls,
such a relation between any public men, I say if I were the
master, I would not own the dog—if I were the dog, I should I 
ashamed of the master
I regret, Mr Speaker, that I have been compelled to say any
thing of a personal character I have told the House that I quit
all communication with the member from Virginia; believink
that to submit to his insolence or to fight was necessary 1 could
not submit, as to fighting, when the gentleman desnes Oiat^X
shall give him an answer And now, sir, in conclusion, Ih.aye
only to say to the member from Virginia,( Lay on, MacduflJ" 1
am ready to meet any issue to which it may lead.
Mr GUSHING said there were two classes of questions in-
volved in this debate first, those suggested by what had been
s ud by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Underwood] touch-
ing the originating of the committee, second, the question*
suggested by the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina
[Mr Stanly] as to the action of the Committee on Expendi-
tures    He wished to submit some observations on both.
But, before doing*his, he would take up the subject at a dif
ferent point It appeared from the documents that on the 5th
of February the House called upon the President of the Uni*
ted States to communicate the report of the commission ap
pointed to investigate the affairs of the New York custom
house On the 28 h of April, the Committee on Expenditures
in the Department of State reported to the House the report
of one only of the commiss oners the resolution of the 5t,h of
February being still unexecuted The report of the commit-
tee was made as their own, no intimation being given that it
was a mere introduction to Mr Pomdexter's report Had
there been any apprehension of this, it could not have beei>
printed, for, had ihfre even been a majority to print, if a sin-
gle member demanded the reading, the whole must be read*
and the mere volume of thedocuments would have in erposed
a delay In the Intelligencerof the next morning appeared a
repott from that committee, stating that they had repeatedly
called on the President and Secietaiy of the Treasury for the
report of the commission, but in vain, and hence they had
summoned Mr Pmndcxter to appear before them, and bring
with him a copy of his own report This report wholly sup
pressed the fact that the original had not been in the President's
hands a week On this statement of facts, the question arose,
whether the proceeding of the committee, m introducing undei
such circumstances the report of one commissioner alone, waa
a proper proceeding? That the House did at the time, oron the
sub equent day, consider it as improper, was plainly inferri-
ble from what had to day been stated by the gentleman from
Vermont, [Vlr Everett,]—that, but for certain statementsof the
gentleman near hira irom Virginia, [Mr Wise,] the House
would have considered the ordei to punt But (he course was
now defended by 'the gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr.
Stanlv,] and reference was had to precedents and to doctrine
in its rapport
They were toM that on previous occasions commit ees of
the House had called for executive papers, and had summoned
heads oí depaitments before them, and had even required testi-
mony as to the secrets of a cabinet council But was there any
analogy between the cases'* Had they anv relation to each
other? Congress had a right to call for information, sd had us
committees, and they satura ly and necessarily applied to the
repositories of thf Government But how far they might go
in requiring testimonv, wasadifferentquestion. Before Mr Rush
would consent to tell what had'parsed m a cabinet council,
he very properly applied to Mr Monroe for permission Mr.
C would not deny that a committee, empowered to send for
persons and papers, might call on any officer of Government to
testifv But that did not touch the merits of this case Let re-
sort be hai toother analogous and truer ones Suppose a for-
eign minister, on his way fiom his own Government to ours,
having impoitant documents to dehvei, and suppose a com
mitten, either fiom a desire to annoy the President, or for some
political and paity purpose, should get possession of his papers,
and bung them on the floor of Coneress What would be
thought of such an act? Could a case be found, m all history,
of the arrest of diplomatic despatches while in transitu to the
Executive? Was it no¡ an abuse thus to extort papers and
bring them prematurely before Congiess? Was it not a usurpa*
non on the Execi tive functions ?
But this cace miffht be objected to as referring to foreign ne
gotiations ¡Suppose, then, a naval court martial to have sat on
the ease of an officer accused, would it be proper in a committee
to «end the judge advocate a ¡.ubpeena duces tecum, and require
him to bring the proceedings of the court before the House?
There was a common principle applicable to all thesecases.
Here was a commissioner whose repoi t was required to be
made to the Secretary of the Treasury, and on that tcport were
to depend certain official duties of the President None would
deny tha' the universal praetiro of the Government had been,
that all Executive documents, reached the House through the
Executive department The Constitution assumed that there
w ¡s to be a partition of duties—some to be performed by the
Executive some by the Legislature From all these reasons
Mr C insisted that the course of tie committee had been im'
piopei
Wuressins such a trappuction, he naturally looked around
forborne theory on which the committee feoceeded— «orne mo
tives to ai count for then conduct, but the more he reflected, the
more unable he was to discern any =atisfactoiy clew to account
for it Was it foi inv pit v purpose?— was it foi anypubhc
pulposa There was no allegation—none at least, that was sup-
\ orted by evidence—of any puipo^e on the pari of the President
to suppress the mfi mat on p" f ured by tin report
[A voice, "No1 what is the Pieeident's letted '}
K H wa ^aid that the lnfirmamn was highly important, be
it so Bur why not wan till it ca re regularly before TheHniw?
In the melase of the Presi !enr oí thf 9th Pehruary, he had in
formed the House that he slnul 1 communicate the result of this
'■ommissinn when obtaine 1 Had any pn of been produced to
the contrary'* Reference, to bp sure, nad been had to an extract
fi am a letter of the President tj Mr Poindexter, in Which the
Piesident «aid that Execu ive actnn on the report was a
matter for himself And was it not so? If the object of the
committee had been to entrap the Pres-dent, had they not qe.
