for which requisitions have not been lequired, the
amount ot v. Inch is not known
In my last re poll to the House of Repi esenta-
tives of the 13th of October last, I expressed an
opinion that no further appropriation would he
wanted for the expedition for the present \eai,
but in ascertaining «ill the expenditures for the
vessels since they left Noifolk, and what is still
tequired lor their equipment, it may be Jound that
a further appropriation will be wanted tor the
piesentjeai, the amount of which cannot now Le
stated
In obedience to a law ol the 3d oí ¡Starch, 1835,
authoi i/mg the construction of n dry clock for the
naval seivice in the haibor ol New Yoilv, or m its
adjacent vvateis, 1 cAused sourdmys and other
examinations to be mae'c b\ an able engineer,
Loammi Balden, Esq loi the purpose ol selecting
a propel site lot such a dry clock The lepoit ot
Mr Baldwin was decidedly in favor ol the piesent
navyjard at Brooklyn as this site, which was
accordingly íecommendcd m my rcpoit to the
House ol Representatives. This it appeals, how-
ever, was not satisfactoiy, and on the .id ol June,
1836, the House of Representatives, by then u so-
lution, directed this Department to ascett.un, is
far as practicable, the piacicability ol establishing
a navv vard at or ihmi Barn Island, m the stints
called the East Rivet, which connects Long Island
sound with New Yorli ba\—al-o at Puili Amboy
and Jersey city, in the State ol New Jersey —the
comparative advantages and disadvantages oi
those sites, and the sue oí ilia nivy yard at the
Wallabout, on Long Island, for the purposes ot a
navy yard, the expense of creeling the «oiks
recommended by Colonel Ba'dwm at the Wall-
about, aecoirhng to tne phn piesenbed by that
engineer, the expense of i elr^ dork -\t each oi the
above positions, the cxpt >se. ol purchasing the n -
ces«ary quantity of land, and electing buildings of
equal convenience with those now owned by ihe
United Slates at the "Wallabout, and the probable
amount for which the lands, buildings, and other
property of the United States at the Wallabout,
might be disposed of, it oifen d for sale.
Under this resolution, I employed Mr Baldwin
to make the necessarj examination": and inquines,
and on the 10th oi December I ist submitted to the
House Mr Baldwin* vei\ cliborie nport, by
which if w ould app< ar ih it th< na\ \ >ard -U Brook-
lyn, according to bis form i repnt, «hould be
seltcted as the site ol the pr< posed diy dock
On the 22d oí Februaiy list, the House ol Re-
presentatives resolved lhat the Secretiry oí Hie
Navy be directed to cause an examination to he
made of the various positions not heretofore exa-
mined withm the waters of the New York bay and
its vicinity, which are adapted to the establishment
and construction of diy docks, and to report their
comparative advantages and disadvantages to the
House of Representatives at the opening; of the next
session of Congress
Under this resolution, I emplojel Piolessoi
James Renvuck, of New Yoilr, to mike the hp(<m-
tary examinations Hp sum1 ed, xv lib gieal labor
and care, a bay at Constable's Po nt, in New
Jersey, called Kill Van Kull, which, in his opi-
nion, presentó many advantages as a station for a
dry dock and navy yard, which will be commutn-
mcaled to the House of Rep-esentatives m i sepa-
rate report
It is greatly to be regretted that so much time
has been lost m making the proper selection for the
site of this dry dock, the completion of which would
be of the greatest advantage to the naval s?rvicc
In my last annual report, I stated that pre-
viously to the passing of the act of the 30th oí
June, 1834, for the better organization of the United
States Marine Corps, doable rations had been
allowed to the Commandant ot the Corps, and to
the officers of the same, commanding at the navy
yards at Portsmouth, Boston, New York, Phda
delphia, Washmeton, Norfolk, and at Pen^acola ,
to the senior marine officers in the squadrons m the
Mediterranean, the West Indies, on the Brazilian
coast, and m the Pacific ocean • all receiving the
sanction of Congress by their appropriations. By
this act, the officers of the Marine Corps are to
r«eeÍT  the same pay, emoluments, and allowances,
as aie given to ofheers oí similar grades in the
infantry of the Armv
The act of the 16th of Match, 1802, fixing the
peace establishment of the United States, autho
n/es allowances to the' commanding officers of
each separate post, of such addmnnnl number of
rations as the President of the United States shall,
iiom tune to time, direct These provisions of the
last act wete continued by an act oí the 3d of
March, 1815, fixing the military peace establish-
ment
The paymaster of the maime coijis nude pry-
menls for double lattons to officers heretofoie re-
ceiving the same, from the 1st of July to the 30th
oí Sepltmber, 1851, but the accounting ofheers of
the Tieasuiy did not think pioper to allow the
sime, inasmuch as (he commands of these officers
had nevei been designated as scpaiate stations
agreeably to ihc rule prescribed tor the Army 
This wius a case oí difficulty which, it was te
spectfully suggested, required legislative intu-
it tenet-, which suggestion I beg leive to lopeat
Tin mle f u allowing double orineioascd lations
should be fixed bv Inv Tins subject has íeceived
the attention, but not the final action of Congtess
Then pott ol Commodores Stew at t and Dallas,
and Captain Bolton, who vveio appointed a boaidto
picpaie plans lot the impiovement ol the navy
vaul at Puis tenia, contama no estimate o( the ex-
pense ol cinying the proposed improvements into
effect, and as that expense must be necessarily
vei) great, it was deemed pioper to employ an
able engineer to make the necessary estimates
Col Lodtnmi Baldwin, under whose superm-
temlence our two dry docks were constructed, was
applied to foi this pmpose, and an arrangement
made with him to perfoim this seivice, if tl e pro-
fi sional husmees he hid engaged to perfhrm in
the Sue of (í-orgia would permit, oí whieh theie
would have been but little doubt, but his loss of
health in this previous duty was such as to leave
no hope lhat he could, inning the proper season,
make Ihe examinations and estimates required
An arrangement has since been made with Col
Tottcn of the- Army, with the assent of the Secretary
oí War, to make these examinations and estimates,
and he is now on his way to Petisacola lor this
purpose It is hopeel that, in the course of this and
the ne xt month, this important duty may be pei-

And ihe present annual charge is $87,767 70
This st tement is complete to the 1st of October,

The amount of arrears to invalids under Ihc act of
the 3d of March, 1837, is-          -§117,949 85a
The amount of arrears to widows is -  270,195 37i
Theamountof arrears to children is-  100,341 80
Total of arrears as ascertained to the
l«t of October, 1837, and paid to
1st of July, 1837, under the same
act, is       -           -           -          -$578,417 12
The amount of stocks owned by the Navy Pension
Fund on the 1st of October, 1837,
was          -           -           -           $1,049,232 25
On the 8th of November, 1837, there
was sold Pennsylvania stock be-
longing to the fund, to the nomi-
nal amount of          -$55,000 00

Privai ekr Pf NsioN Fund
It was mentioned in my last annual report, that
this fund would piobably be exhausted pieviously
to January, 1838 , accordingly, the last stock was
sold in May last, and the proceeds applied to pen-
sions
The number oí pensioners payable out of this fund
is......36
And the annual amount required to pay
them          ...           -          #2,920
Pensions to invalids were, according to law,
gianted to be paid during life, or continuance of
disability , it is therefore recommended, as in my
last report, lhat provision be made to pay these
pensioners
It is estimated that the annual sum of $4,000 00
will be sufficient, not only fortius purpose, but also
to pay the debts of the iund, and satisfy any
claims that may be allowed under existing laws.
On the 1st ot January next, six months1 pay will
be due, and should a lawnot be made early enough
to authorize the payment at that tune, most of the
pensioners will, in all probability, be much dis-
tressed and disappointed.

The balance in the Treasury to the ciedit of this
iund on the 1st of October, 1836, was #75,717 36

The particulars from xvhich the above statements
are made, will be seen m the documents accompa-
nying this report.
A separate report, in obedience to a íesolution
of the Senate of the 13th of October last, will be
made, of the state, condition, and amount, of the
Navy Pension fund, the operation and effect upon
the fund by the act of the 3d of March last, for the
more equitable administration of the Navy Pension
fund, and the number and names of persons placed
on the pension list, the times when pensions were
granted to them, and the amount of money paid to
each under said act
The duties imposed upon this Department by (he
operation of this act, are extremely onerous, and
require, as I wculd most respectfully suggest, the
aid of a sepaiate bureau, under a proper head as
Commissioner of Navy Pensions, with powers and
duties similar to those of the Commissioner of Pen-
sions of the War Department
lh compliance with the resolution of the House
of Representatives of the 3d of March, 1836, a
board oí officers was appointed to a«cettam tin- ef-
ficiency, and test the safety, of the medium oi light
guns of the Navy, and to compare their effects
with those of the guns for which they were proposed
to be substituted The necessary preparations and
other causes prevenied the completion of these du-
ties until the 28th of September last.
From the report made by the board on that day,
it appears that, after subjecting the meciium or light
guns to severe tests, they were aH satisfied with
their safety when used with proper charges
They were also unanimously of opinion that the
medium thirty-two pounders were to be preferred
to the heavy tweiuy-four pounders for the upper
gun decks of ships of the line, and three of the five
commissionels would prefer the medium thirty-two
pounders to twenty-four pounders, for the gún
decks of heavy frigates.
The comparative advantages between, tha light
twenty-four pounders and the forty~lwo,pGm!ticai~-
ronadea, seem to leave the question d fata ***-
