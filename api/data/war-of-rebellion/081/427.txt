to the fact that the division officers are volunteers and their musters have to be countersigned by a regular corps commissary. I have applied for several, but have as yet received no reply. I also repeat my request for Colonel Burton as chief of artillery. I am importunate in my request, as I consider an efficient staff necessary to the welfare and success of my command and the operations before me.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, June 25, 1864.

Major-General SMITH,

General Meade has been asked if he can spare Colonel Burton. He says he cannot. Colonel Piper, of the Tenth New York Artillery, is with you. Can you not take him?

Major General W. F. SMITH,Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

General Meade says he requires the services of Colonel Burton. The lieutenant of the Eighth Infantry you wish as commissary of musters will be detailed at once. If you know of an officer fitted to perform the duties you desired Colonel Burton assigned to please send his name, and he will be ordered to you if his services can possibly be spared.

Yours, truly,

General BUTLER:

I would prefer [not] to have any one act as my chief of artillery unless I can have an old officer of great experience, scientific attainments in his profession, and of activity. Therefore, I prefer to have neither Colonels Greene nor Gibson.
