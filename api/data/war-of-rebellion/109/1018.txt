Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: General Barringer has just reported that he is skirmishing pretty sharply with the enemy on the road from Salem Church to Rock's. I do not think that it is anything but cavalry.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

Major-General.

MALVERN HILL, June 15, [1864].

Colonel WALTER H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The enemy's cavalry drove in our pickets and got possession of Malvern Hill. As soon as Colonel Gary could be got up he was driven back and across the creek. Am now pushing diwn the river road. General Barringer had to be withdrawn from Rock's, but is now moving mack; severeal prisoners and some killed. Prisoners taken were from Wilson's division and Chapman's brigade. Said they knew of nothing but their brigade on river road. I think it was merely a reconnaissance.

Respectfully,

W. H. F. LEE.

JUNE 15, 1864-5 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I understand from Colonel Gary that the river is picketed from Cahffin's Bluff to Varina. I have some two hours since, however, sent Major John M. Lee to investigate and ascertain the position of affairs in that vicinity, with orders to report anything of importance to General Anderson. I am pushing the enemy back on all the roads. Ii have not heard from Colonel Gary, who re-enforced Lieutenant-Colonel Robins on the road from Riddell's to Nance's Shop. General Barringer is pushing the enemy on all roads south of that.

Respectfully,

W. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.

JUNE 15, [1864]-9 a. m.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Northern Virginia:

COLONEL: There is no enemy above York River Railroad save a small force of infantry and cavalry at White House on yesterday, who were reported to be leaving there. My line extends down from Barker's Store, across to Pamunkey River by Black Creek Church. Would be lower down, but do not think it proper to do so as long as Sheridan is above and the difficulty of supplying the command, having to cross the river at New Bridge. Prisoners all agree in saying their destination was south side of James.

Respectfully,

J. R. CHAMBLISS,

Brigadier-General.
