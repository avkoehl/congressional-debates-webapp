HARPER'S FERRY,

February 27, 1863.

Captain MEANS, Berlin, [Md.:]

Within the last few days I have sent two expeditions after White's cavalry, in Loudoun County. One went to Leesburg, and the other toward Snicker's Gap, neither of which found the enemy. I have no doubt, however, that at least a portion of his command is in that county, but they are in small detached portions, for the purpose of enforcing the conscript act and stealing horses.

Unless you have some reliable information as to where White can be found, I am not disposed to approve of the expedition. You will please come up to-night to see me.

Respectfully, yours,

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
