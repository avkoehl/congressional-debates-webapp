morning I waited for the return of the party for some time, and then moved to this point, where I have just arrived. The enemy's scouts were in my rear this morning I destroyed an iron furnace, owned by the rebel Government, last night. I have sent forward down Tye River to capture a wagon train of the enemy, which passed near here this morning. I am awaiting your orders as to my next movement.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. DUFFIE,

Commanding First Cavalry Division:

SIR: We are in possession of Lexington. You will come to this place with your whole command by the most practical route, and with as little delay as possible. You will send forward to notify me of your approach, and you will report in person to me as soon as you arrive.

Your very obedient servant,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, W. Va., June 11, 1864.

W. P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad:

The information communicated to you by telegraph yesterday was entirely correct. Gilmor was lying night before last in a grove about a mile from Duffield's. He did not dare to attack the train on account of the vigilance of our forces. He (Gilmor) was awaiting re- enforcements, which he expected last nigh. My cavalry encountered them, killed and captured several, and drove them back. I am awaiting particulars, and will telegraph you whether or not it is necessary to have a guard on the train for a few nights.

By order of Brigadier General Max Weber:
