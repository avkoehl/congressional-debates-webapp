Hereafter the carbine will be habitually carried on the person or in the hands of the men, and under no circumstances will they be allowed to be strapped on the saddle. Many horses are rendered unserviceable by sore backs caused by this practice; it is a grievous error and must be corrected day once. Commanding officer will be held responsible that this order is strictly complied with, and that any violation of the same is properly punished. This order will be read at once to every company in this command.

By order of Brigadier-General Torbert:

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
