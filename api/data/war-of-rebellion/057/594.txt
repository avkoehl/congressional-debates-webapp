COLONEL: I herewith transmit you, as near as my memory serves me, according to promise, the demand made by Major-General Forrest, C. S. Army, for the surrender of Fort Pillow, Tenn.:

Major BOOTH,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Fort Pillow, Tenn.:

I have force sufficient to take your works by assault. I therefore demand an unconditional surrender of all your forces. Your heroic defense will entitle you to be treated as prisoners of war, but the surrender must be unconditional. I await your answer.

FORREST,

Your obedient servant,
