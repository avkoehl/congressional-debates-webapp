at Tullahoma last night. Rebel cavalry reported in the vicinity of Shelbyville, but reports confused and vague. General Milroy recalled the troops from McMinnville and Manchester yesterday, believing his line of road was menaced by Forrest. I directed him to countermand the order. I have directed the Fourth Michigan to come directly to this place. I will send full report of matters here this evening. Received dispatch from General Granger last night that he had sent off everything from Huntsville, except some rubbish and refugees, retaining a strong rear guard of cavalry. I attempted to dispatch him in reply, but the lines were reported down between Stevenson and Huntsville. It may be that communication between this and Nashville will be disturbed, and it might be well for you to give me instructions to govern my actions in that case, whether under circumstances I should move out and join in the battle that may be fought in front of Nashville. The troops here are mostly raw, but would be of use to you in an emergency.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Murfreesborough:

Your dispatch received. In the event of communications being cut off between us, I want you to hold Murfreesborough secure. As soon as General Smith arrives I will have troops enough here to whip Hood if he ventures this far. As soon as the commissary stores at Tullahoma can be taken away, you had better withdraw Milroy to Murfreesborough by way of Shelbyville; the troops at Elk River bridge might also come to Murfreesborough if they have time, or concentrate on the tunnel if cut off from Murfreesborough.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Murfreesborough:

A large force of the enemy's cavalry has got across Duck River, and you may look out for him about day after to-morrow, possibly to-morrow. I have ordered two trains to go to Tullahoma, to load up with the subsistence stores at that place for Chattanooga. Milroy should leave as soon as the stores are loaded up.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 29, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The Fourth Michigan has arrived. Everything here seems to be in good condition. I have just returned from a ride with General Van Cleve and Major Willett through the fortifications.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
