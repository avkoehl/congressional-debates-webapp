The Clerk read as follows:
An act to amend an act to incorporate the inhab-
itants of the city of Washington, passed. May 15,
1820-
Vic it cnactsd, <&c.t That the first paragraph of sec-
tion eight of an act to incorporate) the inhabitants
oi the city of Washington, passed May 16,1820, be
amended so as to road as follows: that the said cor-
poration shall ho.vo full power and authority to lay
taxes on particular wards, parts, or sections of the
city for their particular local improvement, and to
cause the curbstones to be set, the foot and carriage-
ways to bo graded and paved, or so much thereof as
they maycloem best, andthc necessary sewerage and
drainage facilities to bo introduced under aad upon
flie whole or any portion of any avenue, street, or
alley; and also to cause the same to be suitably paved
and repaired, and to be at all times properly cleancd
and watered: and also to cause lamps to he erected
therein, and to light the same, and pay the cost
(hereof out of tho funds of the ward in which such
improvements shall he made. This provision not to
he construed as repealing, but being intended as
auxiliary to the power they already possess to make
local improvements on the application of the owners
of property bonoiited thereby.
Mr. KNOTT. Now, it must be apparent to
the mind of every gentleman here that the
statements about the want of power in the city
of Washington to improve Pennsylvania avenue
amount to nothing. They have conferred upon
them by that act a3 full and complete power
over Pennsylvania avenue as they have over
any lettered or numbered street in the city;
and there is nothing in this pretext that Con-
gress lias reserved jurisdiction over that ave-
nue. That act provides that the corporate
authorities shall have the power to provide for
levying a tax upon the different wards and
portions ofthe city for particular localimprove-
ments; and that covers the whole ground,
Mr. GILFILLAN. 1 yield back the rest of
my time to the chairman of the committee,
[Mr. Cook.J
Air. COOK. Mr. Chairman, when ivill the
forty minutes allowed for debate expire?
The CHAIRMAN. But three minutes re-
main of the forty.
Mr. KNOTT. My time has not quite ex-
pired. I yield the balance of it to the gentle-
man from Indiana, [Mr. Coisuiuf.]
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr. Kkott] had bat a minute of
his time left to yield.
Mr. COBURN. I am in favor of the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Missouri, which
provides that the property-holders on the
avenue and in the city of "Washington shall
liay for the whole improvement. And now, as
regards Pennsylvania avenue, just let mo say
a word. It has already cost this Government
$422,C9D. It seems to me that that is enough
for the people of the United States to have
spoilt upon one avenue in this city. I desire
also to say that those little parks and triangular
squares are not occupied in any sense by the
Government. The Government has no build-
ing on them, and has no use for them. Like
the streets, they are for the use and benefit of
tlie citizens of Washington city, and the city,
therefore, should pay for the improvements iu
front of them.
The amendment I have offered provides that
the Government shall pay for the improve-
ments opposite the public grounds or reserva-
tions, including these triangular parks. But
I think the amendment of the gentleman from
Missouri is preferable to the amendment I
have offered, because these squares are used
by the citizens and are for the benefit of the
city.
The following is the amount of expenditures
made by the Government here for the benefit
exclusively of the city of Washington, making
a total of over eight and a half million dol-
lars. It is time the city was taking care of
itself and making its own streets. The House
will see that avast amount has been expended
on the streets, avenues, and bridges of this
city.
The amount of money expended by the
United States for the benefit of the people of
Washington city and the District, up to the 1st
of January, A. D, 1870, is as follows, as shown

Mr. COOK. I desire to offer the following
amendment:
Insert after tho word "Government," in lino twenty
four, on page 3, the following:
That portion of the pavement extending in front
of Market square,between Seventh and Ninth streets,
to aline within two feet ofthe railroad, shall be paved
by the lessees of the said square.
The CHAIRMAN. The time limited by
order of the House for debate on the bill is
now exhausted. The first question will be on
the amendment first offered by the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Cook] on behalf of the
Committee for the District of Columbia.
The committee rose informally, and the
Speaker resumed the chair for the purpose
of receiving a
message seom the senate.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Gorham,
its Secretary, informed the House that the Sen-
ate insisted upon its amendments, disagreed to
by the House, to the bill of the House No.
1087, to define the duties of pension agents,
to prescribe the manner of paying pensions,.
and for other purposes, agreed to the confer-
ence asked on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses thereon, and that Mr. Edmunds, Mr.
Pratt, and Mr. McCrbery, had been appointed
as the conferees on the part of the Senate.
PA VINO PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.
The Committee of the Whole resumed its
session, and the consideration of the bill to
provide for the paving of Pennsylvania avenue.
The first question was upon the amendment
moved by Mr. Cook, to insert after the word
"provided," in line seventeen, section three
of the printed bill, the following:
The said railroad company shall have the right to
construct that portion of the pavement which it is
required to pay for, under tho direetion of said com-
missioners, and if said railroad company shall not
construct that portion of said work in as substantial
a manner and as rapidly, and, except between the
rails, with the samo material as the residue of said
work shall be constructed, thon tho same shall bo
constructed under thedirection ofsaid commissioners
in tho samo rnannor as tho other portions of said
work.
Mr. KNOTT. I rise to a parliamentary
inquiry.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will hear tho
gentleman.
Mr. KNOTT. The time for general debate
having expired, is it not in order to consider
this bill by sections for amendment ?
The CHAIRMAN. The billhas never been
read by sections.
Mr. KNOTT. Would it not be the proper
way to read this bill by sections for debate and
amendment?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is of opinion
that the amendments proposed by members of
the Committee for^the District of Columbia
should be first considered, and then amend-
ments from other gentlemen will be in order.
The question was then taken upon the amend-
ment moved by Mr. Cook; and it was agreed to.
The next question was upon the series of
amendments moved by Mr. Giuillan-. The
first amendment was to section three, to strike
out the words "twenty-two feet outward" and
to insert in lieu thereof the words "to the lino
within two feet of the said railroad track lying
next to the side of the street on which said
private lots or parts thereof front."
The next amendment-was to strike oat of
section three the following words:
The residuo of pavement lying between tho part
paid for by private owners and that part paid for by
t.ho railroad company shall be paid for by the United
States Government.
The next amendment was to strike out of
the same section the words " or where avenues
or lettered streets intersect it; " also, strike out
the words " and intersections."
The next amendment was to section five, to
strike out the words "purchase-money" and
insert the words "the debt;" also, strike out
"purchase" and insert "indebtedness."
And the last amendment moved by Mr. Gil-
fillak was to section six, in line nine of the
printed bill, strike out the words "one hun-
dred and ; " also, to add to the section the
following:
And that no part of/ueh appropriation shall be
applied to the paving of any part of said avenue
except that portion lying directly in front of public
reservations and within two feet of the said railroad
track. *
