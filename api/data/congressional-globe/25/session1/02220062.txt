25th Cong....1st Sess.                            Making public officers depositories—Mr. Niles.                                                     Senate.
cupied the attention of Congress It was one to
which he had given some attention, and on which
he had reflected much, yet he should not probably
have troubled the Senate with any remarks, had it
not been for the obseivations oí his distinguished
friend from Virginia (Mr Rives)m hisspeechycs
terday That Senator, in support of the bill which
he had introduced foi designating the public funds,
which was similar in its provisions to the bill that
passed both Houses of Congress last session, and
which he (Mr N ) and other fnends of the ad-
ministration then supported, made an eloquent ap-
peal to himself and others to come out at this time
m support of his present bill, or show good reasons
why they could not do so
Mr N said he would respond to the call, he
could not support the gentleman's bill, but he would
endeavor to give his reasons why he could not
He last session gave his hearty suppoit to the bill
referred to, which passed with great unanimity
Ho did so because he considered that bdl as con-
taining no new principle, and only carrying out
what was then the established policy of the Gov
en ment, it leltthe funds recen able ioi the revenue
as they were placed by the joint resolution of 1810,
but contained some provisions intended 10 operate
as inducements upon the Statebanks to discontinue
the issue of notes oí the low er denominations It
was true the bill superseded the Treasury circular,
and he (Mr N ) was, then disponed to do that, for
the same reasons stated by the gentleman from
Virginia, he also legarded that as a temporaiy
measure, intended for a particular emeigency to
arrest a special mischief But he could not agree
with the Senator m the opinion that the íailuie ol
that act, and the continuance of the Tieasury outer,
was one of the causes which had contnbnted to the
pecumaiy distress of the counti y He had, at the
last session, supposed that the exigency w hich had
called foith the oidei had ] asscd off, but had
since become satisfied that he w as mistaken , c,ich
had been the condi ion ot the financs of the Gov
ernment, and the monetary affans of the ronntit
that he was fully persuaded the order had exeited
a most salutary influence, alike favorable to the
Government and to the counti v
It has secured the revenue recened irom the
public lands, and lemforced the western banics with
specie, which has enabled iliein to "ustain them-
selves, until the general storm came upon them, as
it swept, over the whole country But had it not
been for the operation of the order, the western
banks would not merelj have suspended payment,
but Would have exploded months before lhe>, m
common wuh others, suspended payments Ano
ther good effect ol the eontmi at ce ol the cdei
was, that it had dinwn specie lrom the binks all
over the country, ind tin own it into emnlatioi
amo ig the people in the western Stites w lie re he
understoo 1 moie specie was to bo found in ciruila
tion than in -my o'hei section of the Un on And
the specie which had been lccened for the public
lands had been an impoitint resource to the Gov
ernment in its piesentemergency
Mr N said he gave h s suppoit to ibp cunency
bill bee ause he did not then think the time had come
to change the policy of the Government m respect
to the funis m which the revenue was collected
Among the reasons why he could not then go w ith
his distinguished inend from Missouri, (Mr Ben
ton,) who so strenuously opposed the cunency bill,
was the impoitant fac l, that the entire financial con-
cerns of the Government were then conducted
through the agency of about nmctj banks It was, in
hisopmion, in vam to think to change out currency
as long as we employed the agency of banks, as all
public moneys deposited m them y eie immediately
changed to bank credits Tie then beLe\ ed (hit, as'a
prelimmaiy siep to the collec ion of tl e revenue m
specie, we must dispense with th„ agency of' anks
Sir, the late pdmimstn'ion adopte I a certain pol
icy m regaid to the finances of theGo/einmcnl
and he (Mr N ) saw no occasion to change that
policy at the last scs on of Congress, and the ques
lion on which he and the Senator froi  Vug nia
differ, is whcthei the great chinees which hate
smce taken place, jn the piostiation not only of
the deposite banks bu1 of the entire banking sys-
tem of the country the serio is embarrassments to
the finances and the s"neral derangement of the
monetary affans of the mti >n leqiure a change m
tha pohev^ Has the deposite bank scheme failed1
The Senator from Vuginia limits mt he resarcís
ttie present derangement as the icstilt of lempoi.a
ry cau'es, some of which originated m the meas
ures of the Government, he thinks that, notwith-
standing a gusi ol wind may have capsized the de-
posite banks, they can be righted, refittec1, and again
put in service but he (Mr N ) thought the banks
had faded in their duties bo h to ihe Government
and to the public They had proved themselves to
be either weak or faithless agents, and perhaps
both , they had suspended payment, they had been
guilty of a voluntary act of bankruptcy, in a time
of profound peace, and immediately following a pe-
riod of unusual prosperity, (or w hat was so regard-
ed,) and when they had in their vaults nearly thirty
millions of the public funds This suspension y as
entirely different from that of 1814, when the Gov-
ernment itself had been the principal cause of the
vast and datigeious issues of the banks, by which
they were broken down
Whether the general and simultaneous failure of
the banks was \oluntary and fraudulent as suppos
ed by some, oi ameasuie of necessity, arising fiom
the over action and imprudent management of
those institutions, was not very material, in. eithei
case they must be regaidedas unsafe depositories
of the public revenues They might answer in
ordinary times, when we had a clear sky and
smooth sea, when the commerce and finances of
the country were stable and íegulai, but they
could not be depended uoon m times ol difficulty
And m the present instance hey had failed, and
violated their engagements to the Government and
to 'he public, without any appaient cause, other
than then o\ n mismanagement He would not
chaige the banks of having voluntarily been faith
less agents , bul he would say that they had violat-
ed then high arid solemn obligations to the Gov-
ernment and to the public, without any reasonable
efforts—he might almost say without any effort at
all—to save their own credit and that of the com-
mercial community When the cusís came, main-
ly brought on by their own imprudent action, how
did they meet it' Did the> bieast the storm with
the heart and nerve,-which the occasion called
lorl did they make any rea^onble cJoUs to
w eather it and save the countiy fiom the calamities
which 1m e o\ eiwhelmed it f Par, vert far, from
this If we lock to the point where the extended
line of banks first gave way —the city of New York
—w e shall discovei the strongest evidence of cow -
ardice or tieachery What land did the banks
make1 how long did they sustain themselves
against a runt The Bank of England, m 1825,
sustained itself against a run for an entire year,
and when a general panic pi evaded Why, sir a
fiad concernfhavmg first given way, and been
Doclcd, somejof the people, as was natural, became
alai ned but there was no general panic , a crowd
gathered round the banks they were rot deposit
oís or pcisons wko had means to acqune am con
suleiable demands against banks most of them
probably w ere ' boof blacks,'' chimney sw eeps ' and
' y ash v omen,' w ith a single bill each of tne low ei
denomination, or perhaps they wcic of tin* class
of citizens, who aie becoming \eiy notonous of
la'e—the luco focos, the officers of the banks look
out at their windows and see this formidable array
of persons, all armed with their " promises to pay,'
about to make an assault upon the banks What is
to be done 1 can we make a stand 1 can v/e defend
ourselves against this formidable enemy ! They
did not, however, hesitate long, but, concluding
that " discretion w as the better part of \ aloi," they
detei mined to shut their doois, and keep *hen cred-
itors out This was ceitamlj a comenient mode
of paying debts At other places, the shutting up
of the banks \\ as equally sudden , and, w hat is not
a h tic remaikable, and calculated to eitite a sus-
picion that something was w rong, is the fact, that
th" suspen ion at New Oileans, Mobile, and other
places, occurred a few day after that at New York,
but befoit theie could have been am oommunici
turn 1 hese facts are at least calculated to excte
a suspicion that theie was a preii us understand-
ing among the pimcipal banks m (lie different ci
ties that the) w ere to suspend payment about the
tunc the explosion took place
But, how ever this may be, he would ask w hether
any one can believe that the banks made an} rea-
ronable eff^its to sustain their own otdit and that
af the country i Can the deposite banks, some ol
vhich po sessed millions oí the public money
ilnch closed their doois and stopped pay ment un-
der such circumstances, be regarde I as faithful
fiscal agents 1 Was it not the duiy of these c orpo
íations to have attempted to sustain their credit,
and to have paid out one quarter or one half oí
their specie befoie they shut their doors m the face
of their creditors 1 Ii they had met the shock res-
olutely, and w ith a willingness to incur a sacri-
fice, who can say that they might not have gone
safely thiough the crisis'*
Mr N said he had lately seen a report of the
Governoi of the Bank of France, for the yearpast
The money pressuie has visited that country;
not m the same seventy that it has prevailed m
England and the United States There the bank
prepared itself to meet the shock, instead of con-
tracting, it enlarged its discounts, extended thetime
of its credits, and, in addition to its own notes, put
into circulation more than one hundred millions of
francs m specie To enable it to do this, and ar-
rest a money crisis, it purchased, at a heavy sacri-
fice, nearly twenty millions of francs of com and
bullion But what saciifices did the banks make
heie, to sustain their own credit, oi that of the
commercial community and of the Government1
In the face of these notorious facts, how can it be
denied that the deposite banks have proved faith-
less and unsafe depo'itones of the public funds'!
They have stopped payment in a tune of peace,
and without an efioit to sustain themselves Can
we trust them again under such encumstanees1
This failure of the deposite banks, and palpable
bieach of trust, has occasioned serious embanass
ments to tl t Government as well as to the country,
and it is the sole cause why we are non assembled
here
Sir, connected with the employment of the State
banks as agents of the Treasury, was a purpose of
contiolhngtheir operations tosome extent, and thus
improving the paper currency He believed that
this formed no part of the original object of the late
President, but it was afterwards engrafted m the
sjslem, and regarded by many as an essential part
of it This featme m the deposite bank scheme
is what seems so highly to lecommend it to the
Senatoi from Virginia The bill he has now m-
tioduced "ontauis piovisions intended as induce-
ments to the Stale banks not to issue noles of the
louer denominations So fai as the regulation of
the State banks, and a resti iction upon their issues,
formed a part of the system, what success had at-
tended it1 He was sorry to say none oi very little
The hopes which were once entertained m this
respect, were now blown to the winds The Sena-
tor from Vuginia still thinks that it is the duty of
this Government to attempt to control and improve
the paper currency of the country by means of ita
revenues, and that this can be accomplished by
employing the State banks as fiscal agents The
gentleman ceilamly has strong faith, the faith of
the giain of mustard seed to which he so happily
alluded m his speech
Sir, the evils of oui banking and paper money
system are too deepiy rooted and too broadly extend-
ed to be collected oi mitigated by any such pallia-
trie-- If the indúceme if, or consideialions of mtei-
est, beid out to the deposite banks, will induce them,
to give up their small notes, and conduct their busi-
ness w ith some little regard to the public interest,
how are those banks to influence or control otliei
Stale banks i Talk about refoimmg the State banks
through the agency of your financial measures'
Why since this attempt commenced, the increase
of banking capital and paper issues has greatly ex-
ceeded any formei period Ihe tide of papei
money has been rising and swelling until its bitter
wa'ers have spead over the whole land, leaving be-
hind everywhere the evidences of their coiruptjng
and deletenous influences
In man} of the States the banking capital had
been mcieascd one nundred pel cent since 1830,
and in others three oi four hunched pel cent , and
their i sues nad increased m propoition Itistiue
tl at the issue of <-ma'l bills has been prohibited in
seveial of the States, not in consequence of our
fiscal measures but as the íe^üll of the- impetus
which may here ha\e been guen to public senti-
ment
But (Mi N saicl)themore he reflected on this fea-
ture n the deposite bank scheme, the more he was
dissatisfied with it What is it but an attempt on the
pai t of this Goy ernment indirectly and through the
foim of contiacts, to supervise and contiol the local
institutions of the States1 The object he admitted
to be good, although he thought impiacticable But
he spoke of the principle which he believed to be
unsound and dangerous The banking corporations
aie a part of the local ms'itutions of the States, as-
much as colleges and couits of justice Can the
i   Fedeial Government rightfully interfere to impose
