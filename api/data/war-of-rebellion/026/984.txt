[Major General D. H. HILL:]

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your dispatch of April 13, 7:30 a. m. My ordnance officer has gone to Boyd's Landing for the Parrott ammunition. When I have completed all the breastworks for batteries and placed guns in them I shall require more troops to support them, otherwise my command will be too much scattered. Colonel [W. F.] Martin had better be sent over, I think. Your instructions will be communicated to Captain Reilly. I do not know at what point on this side your boat will land to establish the courier line you speak of. Three yankee prisoners were brought up this morning by the cavalry from Bath. These men deserted from the troops at New Berne and went over to Hyde County, where they delivered themselves to two of Captain Swindell's men. One is an orderly sergeant, and seems to b an intelligent man. He reports 10,000 troops at New Berne under the command of Palmer; says many of these troops are disaffected and those who are to be discharged in May will not serve longer. I have sent the deserters to Greenville subject to your further orders. They are very anxious that their names should not appear in the papers as deserters for fear in may bring punishment upon them when they return and work to their prejudice at their homes. I therefore hope you will give the necessary instructions should your order them to Richmond.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-The deserters are from the One hundred and first Pennsylvania.

[General D. H. HILL:]

GENERAL: I have given the instructions to Captain Reilly about opening on the Yankee barracks, in accordance with your orders in dispatch of 7.30 a. m. to-day. Colonel Ferebee has been ordered to collect conscript and also to watch the roads you speak of. He says that General Robertson, who was here yesterday, spoke of relieving Colonel Ferebee's men by Griffin's cavalry. I presume he means those on the Jamesville and Plymouth roads. I have frequently impressed upon Colonel F. to guard those roads well, and he informs me that the necessary steps have been taken to do so. My ordnance officer went for the ammunition to Boyd's Ferry this morning. I mentioned, in reply to your note this morning, that I thought it better for Colonel Martin's regiment to join me here, and will send him the order to-night. I can learn nothing of the condition of the enemy inside, but I fear that they can keep themselves supplied by fishing with seines, as fish are very plentiful in the river at this season. I sent up the Jamesville road this morning about 7 miles and found Griffin's pickets on it, so I presume it is all right in that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General.
