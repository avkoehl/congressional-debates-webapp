HDQRS. DEPT. OF MISSISSIPPI AND EAST LOUISIANA, Grenada, December 13, 1862.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Commanding U. S. Forces.

GENERAL: I am credibly informed that Captain W. W. Faulkner, Captain Meriwether, Lieutenant L. N. Johnson, Lieutenant Blakemore and sixteen privates belonging to Partisan Ranger Corps, C. S. Army, have been refused the benefits of the late cartel for the exchange of prisoners of war. These officers and men are as much a part of the C. S. Army as are any other composing it, and as much entitled to the benefits of the cartel as any of your prisoners whom I now hold. I request therefore to be informed of your intentions in reference to the prisoners above referred to, and have to state that I shall cause and equal number of your prisoners to be held in close confinement if the information conveyed to me be correct.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c., your obedient servant,J. C. PEMBERTON,
