the Territory of Utah, and for other purposes;
which was read twice by its title, referred to
the Committee on Territories, and ordered to
be printed.
Mr. SHERMAN asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 177) to provide for a reissue of national
bank notes, and for other purposes; which was
read twice by its title, referred to theComrnit-
lee on Finance, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. SUMNER asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 178) for the relief oLNicholas P. Trist,
negotiator of the treaty of (faadalupe Hidalgo ;
which was read twice by its title.
Mr. SUMNER. I should like to appeal to
the Senate to act on that bill at once. It was
passed during the last fortnight of the late
session, after debate, on the yeas and nays, by
a large vote. The party who is to bo relieved,
Mr. Trist, is a venerable gentleman, now at
Alexandria, aged, very infirm, and very de-
pendent. The Senatej I think, after consid-
eration the other day, gladly adoptedthe bill.
Now I appeal to ttie Senate to put it on its
passage, so that it may go to the House of
Representatives, and at least take its chance
of being acted upon there before we go home.
If there is any objections of course it c&nnotbe
proceeded with, but as the Senate have already
acted on it 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection
to the present consideration of this bill ? _
Mr. HOWE. I dislike very much to inter-
pose an objection, but the Senator will remem-
ber that when this question was before the Sen-
ate before it was debated by several Senators.
Mr. SUMNER. The vote was on the yeas
and nays. There were about thirteen or four-
teen nays. .
Mr. HOWE. I should not want to admit
that there was a small vote against it; but I
admit there was a large vote for it. I think
there ought to have been a much larger vote
against it than there was before, and I am in
hopes there will be now. I do not think the
bill ought to pass, and ! should rather have it
considered by a committee.
Mr. SUMNER. Does the Senator object
to its consideration now ?
Mr. HOWE. I do.
Mr. SUMNER. I will say to the Senator
that this beneficiary is old and infirm and very
dependent. X have peculiar information since
the bill passed the Senate on that subject,
making his case one of peculiar charity. I
would not appeal to the Senate to do what even
any individual Senator would be reluctant to
have done, but I am entirely satisfied myself
of the merits of the bill, and_ I believe on
debate it cannot fail to be sustained.
Mr. HOWE. Well, Mr. President, the Sen-
ator puts it upon the ground of charity. I shall
not interpose an objection against a claim ot
charity. I shall want to know what the claim
is before I vote for it. I voted against the bill
before, and, unless I hear new facts, I shall
vote against it again. But the Senator puts it
on the ground of a charity, and I will not inter-
pose a single objection against any such scheme
as that. I am, therefore, so far as I am indi-
vidually concerned, ready to consider this bill
now. , .
The VICE PRESIDENT. Islhereobjection
to the present consideration of the bill intro-
duced by the Senator from Massachusetts lor
the relief of Nicholas P. Trist? The Chair
hears none, and it is before the Senate as m
Committee of the Whole. Will the Senator
from Massachusetts yield to allow morning
business to be concluded?
Mr. SUMNER. I will, certainly.

disorder in the south.
Mr. MORTON. I offer a resolution, and
ask for its present consideration.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Massachusetts has a bill before the Senate for
present consideration, but has yielded to allow
routine morning business.
Mr. MORTON. This will occupy but a
moment.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following resolution :
Resolved, That two thousand copies of the report
and accompanying evidence, and twenty thousand
copies of thereport withouttheevidence, of the spe-
cial committee appointed to investigate southern
outrages, be printed for the use of the Senate.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I suggest to the Senator
from Indiana that printing the report, I pre-
sume, embraces both the majority and minority
reports. â€ž .
Mr. MORTON. If the minority desire it,
let that be included. It is not my province to
propose the printing of the minority views.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not know that
they do.
Mr. CASSERLY. I took it for granted that
the resolution included the reports of the ma-
jority and minority.
Mr. MORTON. I am willing that it should
be so amended.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be modi-
fied accordingly, and referred to the Commit-
tee on Printing, under the law.

vice in the collection of customs at the various
ports of entry in the United States, and the
disposition of fines, penalties, and forfeitures
incurred under the laws relating to^ customs,
and for other purposes, I gave notice that I
would ask the consent of the Senate at an
early day this week to make a few remarks
upon it. I should be glad now to have the
consent of the Senate to call up the bill for
the purpose of submitting those remarks. 1
shall not occupy much time, and, when I con-
clude, will move to refer the bill to one of the
standing committees.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is a bill
now before the Senate, the bill for the relief
of Nicholas P. Trist, introduced by the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Summer.]
Mr. FENTON. Will the honorable Senator
from Massachusetts give way until I can call
the attention of the Senate to this Dili.
Mr. SUMNER. I do so with great pleasure,
with the understanding that the bill which I
have moved shall not lose its P|ace;
The VICE PRESIDENT. Ihe bill for the
relief of Nicholas P. Trist being before the
Senate, the Senator from New York asks unan-
imous consent that it be informally passed over
that he may submit some remarks prior to
the reference of the bill introduced by him.
If there be no objection, it will be so ordered.
The Chair hears no objection.

duced by me be read, that the Senate may see
what its provisions are.
