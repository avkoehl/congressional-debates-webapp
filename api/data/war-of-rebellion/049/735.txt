Brigadier General G. C. WHARTON,

Have called on the home guards of Montgomery, Roanoke, Botetourt, Bedford, Wythe, Smyth, and Pulaski to aid you. Am afraid to order Sixtieth [Virginia Infantry] away. Communicate with the general by special courier if possible and ask the order from him.

Brigadier General G. C. WHARTON,

Glade Spring:

Have ordered the Sixtieth [Virginia] Regiment to your aid, and will send you quite a large body of home guards. Will order transportation as soon as I can, when they will be ready. Promptness, energy, and skill will yet bring us all right. I rely on you confidently, but use your forces to best advantage to aid General Jones, and defend the salt-works. Communicate with the general at all hazards, but in such a way as to guard against capture of dispatches. Will aid you by every means in my power. Inform General Jones of this move as soon as you can.

By order of Major General Sam. Jones:

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
