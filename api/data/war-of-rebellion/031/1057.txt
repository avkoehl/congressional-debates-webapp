HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, December 11, 1862.

Major General D. H. HILL:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you cook rations for two days, beginning to-morrow,and put in your haversacks, and be in readiness to move in amy required direction. Until further orders,you will continue to guard against any crossing in your vicinity, which will embrace the points now guarded by General Early, as his division moves at dawn toward Fredericksburg. If, consistently with the above, you can take a position in the direction of General Early's encampment, so as to place you nearer to Fredericksburg, it is desirable, as the enemy has thrown a pontoon bridge across the river, about 2 miles below the town, and it may be necessary for you to move to the point of crossing. You will make a selection of such of the reserve artillery as you may deem important to remain with you, and let the rest of it be in readiness to join the other part of the corps at any moment to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
