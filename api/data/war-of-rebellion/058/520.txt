MERIDAN, MISS., January 5, 1864.

DALTON, January 6, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 29th ultimo.* I am unable to confer with General Breckinridge as you desire, he being absent.

The question of converting good infantry into bad cavalry has so often been put before me that my opinions are formed on the subject, and I am glad to be able to say agree fully with yours. Let me beg you, therefore, to adhere to and be governed by the opinion you express. We now want infantry very much, and this Kentucky brigade,though small, is an excellent one. We do not want cavalry; the proportion in all our armies is too great.
