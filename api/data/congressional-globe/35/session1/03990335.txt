Mr. LEACH. If the House will indulge me
in one word of explanation, I think the gentleman
will withdraw the objection. A few days since

information m regard to the harbors and commerce
of Lake Michigan. That resolution was adopted
by the House, and the Secretary of War has re-
sponded to it. It is equallv important that we
should have information with reference to Lakes
Erie, St. Clair, and Superior, and particularly in
reference to Lake Superior, where the copper and
iron business is of importance to the whole nation,
and is a growing one upon the shores of that lake.
It is important that this House should understand
the condition of the commerce and of the harbors
on that lake.
I hope the gentleman will withdraw his objec-
tion.
The objection was not withdrawn.

DEATH OF HON. THOMAS J. RUSK-
A message was received from the Senate, by
Asbfry Dickins, their Secretary, communicate
ing the proceedings of the Senate upon the death
of the Hon. Thomas J. Rusk, late Senator from
Texas.
The resolutions of the Senate were read, and
are as follows:
In the Senate or the United States*
January 19,1858.
Resolved unanimously, That the members of the Senate,
from a sincere desire of showing every mark of respect due
to the memory of the Hon. Thomas J. Rusk, deceased, late
a Senator from the State of Texas, will go into mourning,
hy weanng crape on the left arm for thirtv days.
Resolved unanimously, That, as an additional mark of
respect for the memory of the Hon. Thomas J. Rusk, the
Senate do now adjourn. *
Ordered, That the Secretary communicate these resolu-
tions to the House of Representatives.
Mr. REAGAN. Mr. Speaker, the announce-
ment just made of the death of General Thomas
J. Rusk, late a Senator from the State of Texas,
calls for another pause in the ordinary business
of this House, and for the performance of dhr
last solemn duty, as a body, to the memory of a
great and good man.
General Rusk was a native of the State of South
Carolina, where he studied law, and commenced,
m comparative obscurity, the great business of
life. He subsequently removed to the State of
Georgia, and, in 1835, toTexas. The struggle for
the independence and separate national existence
of Texas, had then begun, and that love of jus-
tice and of rightâ€”that manly courage and lofty
patriotism which so distinguished his after years,
induced him at once to identify his fortunes with
those of the brave spirits there, who had learaed
the value of freedom and equality, and had' de-
termined to meet the perils of war rather than
submit to the loss of their civil and religious lib-
erty.
It is not my purpose now to notice in detail the
many historic events in the life of General Rusk.
This will be the pleasing duty of the historian.
Nor is it my object to pronounce a formal eulogy
upon his life and services. But I come to offer tne
grateful tribute of the brave and generous people
he has so often commanded in battle, and so long,
so ably, so faithfully served in the councils of the
State and nation.
As commander of a volunteer company; as aid
to General Stephen A. Austin; as the first Secre-
tary of War of the Republic of Texas; as the fiist
chief justice of the Republic of Texas; as major
general of the militia of the Republic of Texas,
charged with important duties, and clothed with
large powers; asamember of the convention wh ich
formed the constitution of the Republic of Texas;
as a member of the Congress of the Republic of
Texas; as president of the convention which
formed the constitution of the State of Texas; as
a Senator in the Congress of the United States;
as an eminent and successful lawyer; as an unos-
tentatious and loyal citizen, ever respecting the
laws, the religion, the institutions, and the Gov-
ernment of his country; as a devoted husband and
affectionate fatherâ€”though he has fallen in the
meridian of his manhoodâ€”he has filled the full
measure of a citizen, a soldier, a patriot, a states-
man and hero, to whom the citizens of Texas
will continue to point with pleasure and with pride
as long as their hearts shall continue to beat with
the pride of chivalry, and the love of pure and
unspotted integrity, and exalted and unselfish
patriotism.
General Rusk possessed a mind of uncommon
clearness and strength, and a c6nstitution and
physical vigor capable of great labor and endu-
rance; a commanding and noble person; a pleas-
ant and vivacious temperament; was fond of anec-
dote, and full of kindness and sympathy for the
unfortunate of all grades and conditions. Indeed
his love of justice, and candor, and truth, and his
sympathy for, and readiness to espouse the cause
of the unfortunate, or weak, or oppressed, might
be said to have been his most prominent charac-
