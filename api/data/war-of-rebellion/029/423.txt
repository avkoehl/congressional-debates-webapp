that in all the was cool, prudent, and determined. In the first engagement, when we were surrounded on all sides by the enemy (the right and left having retired far to our rear), he said to me, "We must cut our way through," and gallantly led the division for that purpose;but the enemy wisely opened a way for us, and only closed upon us at a respectful distance. If we have acquitted ourselves with honor, much of it is due to his careful training, his cool self-possession, and the confidence we all fell in him.

Surgeons Bogue, Johnson, and Elliott, and their assistants, rendered all the aid in their power in alleviating the sufferings of the wounded. It is claimed by some of my men that the Nineteenth Illinois took the enemy's colors on the second day. The same is also claimed by the Seventh Brigade. Suffice it to say that the colors were taken, the two brigades acting in concert. And while I desire for my brigade all credit for gallantry, I would not in the least detract from the other, which was side by with us.

In these engagements many of my valuable officers and men were killed and wounded.

Our thinned ranks show how well they faced the enemy. The last engagement was against the enemy's best troops in superior force. They had never before been beaten, but now they were driven in confusion, leaving hundreds of their dead and dying on the field.

Captain Schultz, with his battery, rendered me efficient service, and was ready and enthusiastic in executing my orders. He did his duty well. On the first day one of his pieces became entangled in the woods, and was abandoned. We more than compensated this loss the second day.

I append a list of the casualties, and propose hereafter to make a more detailed report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. R. STANLEY,
