seeks to guide and regulate instead of follow-
ing it.
Even in Mexico, where the slavery of an infe-
rior race was prematurely abolished, there was at
once established, legalized, and regulated, a servi-
tude of poor debtors of all races, to the wealthy,
more profitable to the master, less comfortable to
the slave; subjecting all to the chance of degra-
dation by misfortune, and giving to mere wealth
over all the poor, more than the power, without
the feelings, sympathies, and interests of the mas-
ter.
Any legislation at this time, requiring lands to
be acquired from Mexico to be open to the people
and institutions of one-half the Union to the ex-
clusion of the other, must be inoperative; because
no portion of the American people (other than a
few fanatics) would require or sanction such legis-
lation, if they understood its nature and contem-
plated object; because not only unjust and unwise
in itself, but adverse to the whole spirit of the
Constitution and the Union; and chiefly because
no 'power cmdd enforce such legislation.

lic, the North and South have been inarching with
giant strides and equal footsteps towards the West.

How long would the South pray in vain for such
a boon ? It was because it was to your interest-—
the interest of the whole Union. In modern timesy"
calico and cotton enter as largely into political .as
marcantile speculations. Neither the Wilmot pro-
viso nor any other legislation will defeat the re-
sult. The gentleman from New York [Mr. Rath-
bun] has frightened and alarmed us with the ac-
count of a terrible storm and tornado, accompanied
with violent thunder, which was to arise in New
York, and overwhelm aJl who did not vote as he
does on this subject, and invoked its power spe-
cially upon the devoted head of our staunch and
patriotic friend who stands by us alone from that
State upon this question, and fearlessly and suc-
cessfully defends himself from all the preliminary
storm his colleagues can raise here. I allude to
Judge Stephen- Strong. But does the gentleman
think that the New York storm will reach the
prairies and mountains and rivers west of Arkan-
sas and Texas? Never, sir. One-half the Union
cannot prevent the growth of the other half. If

THE THREE MILLION BILL.
SPEECH OF MR. BROCKENBROUGH,
OF FLORIDA,
In the House of Representatives,
February 13, 1847.
The Three Million Bill, and the following Proviso,
being under consideration:
"Sec. 2. Jlnd be it further enacted, That there shall be
Every step, a State. Of these two mighty floods with more prowess than the proudest Roman le-
of population you propose to stay the one with a *"  ' J -1 - - 'vr
paper barrier, and invite the other to overflow and
swell, till it fills not only its own, but the natural
channel of the population, whose career you would
abruptly terminate. Upon that long line of wil-
derness, from Missouri to the Rio G-rande, you
would, like Canute, vainly order the tide to roll
back.
No one acquainted with the history or character
j of our people can believe this to be a physical or
j political possibility. When and where have they
j recoiled at the bidding of a master? Does the
| Saxon ever go back? Your law would be as un-
' natural, and therefore as vain, as were the laws of
j Texas and Coahuila, which abolished negro sla-
! very arid systematized the worse peonism of the
j white and red man. Our people carried with them
| a milder slavery.
i In this mighty mai*eh of parallel republics, you
! could never have enforced an arbitrary line, had
1 you not placcd it on or near the natural limit be-
1 yond which, to the north, slave labor would never
| seek to extend itself. Had it been for the inter-
! ests of the American people, either of the North or
the South, that slavery should exist north of 36°
30', your Missouri compromise line would have
been idle. Paper barriers will be impotent to stay
the avalanche of the American people from Mis-
souri to the Rio Grande. They will <*o over with
their institutions and with their rifles, and you
never can disarm them. That question was raised
at Concord and Lexington, and finally decided at
San Jacinto. What, then, will you do? Will
you refuse to legislate for them, and withdraw your
parental care and countenance ? Will you declare
them outlaws? The American pioneer will laugh j
at your indignation, and establish an independent :
republic. He thinks mother countries are j^en- ,
erally step-mothers—and always so when by force ;
they seek to regulate the colony entirely for their j
own interest. He can work without apprentice- 1
neither slavery nor involuntaiy servitude in any territory on
the continent of Am - rica which shall hereafter be acqui red by
or annexed to the United States by virtue of this appropria-
tion, or m any other manner whatsoever, except for crimes
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided,
always, That any person escaping into such territory from
whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the
United States, such fugitive ma\ be lawfully reclaimed and
conveyed out of said territory to the peison claiming his or
her labor or service''—
Mr. BROCKENBROUGH rose and addressed
the House as follows :
Mr. Chairman: I have no fears for the Union—
none for the institution of slavery. This is not
from stubborn obstir.acy, or too sanguine temper-
ament, or wilful blindness to passing events, but it
is the result of careful examination and calm reflec-
tion. It will require some deep and grievous
practical wrong to tear the Union from the hearts
of the people. The impracticable dreams of vis-
ionary legislators will not suffice. Slavery will run
its due course and end in its allotted time, and no I
factitious theatrical storm or legislated public opin- |
ion will hasten its hour. Laws laying down lines i
and channels for public opinion in advance are im- |
potent. Artificial, arbitrary, and imaginary legis- j
lative barriers set up to control the current of popu- [
lar will, or interfere with the genius, disposition, j
nature, or necessities of the people, will remain
dead upon the statute-book.
You vainly endeavored to prevent the intercourse
of Indians and whites in time of peace upon an
extended border. You idly essayed to hold back

gions in their brightest days of glory—if a Napo-
leon should lead your armies—you could not keep
back upon that long line the heaving, swelling, re-
sistless mass of American population. If the
southern people stood still, appalled at your hostile
array, and it was the interest of the people of the
country that slaves should be there, there they
j would go; and northern men would carry them.
I They are not more pious in this respect than the
; Pilgrim fathers, or their ancestors of the Hevolu- "
i tion. They brought slaves to vs, to sell, from Af-
! rica: the modern phrase is, they "stole" them—
1 such is the language of the gentleman from Ver-
| mont [Mr. Dillingham]—to sell. Yes, sir, they
| received the money, and now cast doubts upon the
; title. No southern ships brought slaves. We
i had no ships. I have never heard of but two at-
! tempts to violate the African slave trade acts, and
! they were by northern, English, and French par-
ties. Every" mail who will answer upon his con-
science, and as common sense dictates, must admit
this view to be correct. No one can believe that
there is power enough in this Government to en-
force this proviso, or that it will be enforced, if it
is to the interest of the American people, or any
part of them, to violate it, and, if not, then it is
simply an idle insult, and productive of unneces-
sary exasperation. With these opinions,'I can-
i not feel that uneasiness or nervous excitement ex-
I hihited by some gentlemen. This Government
j cannot arrest the pi ogress of events in this re-
! spect.
| If we look this proviso sternly in the face, and
] fearlessly, we see at once that it is idle, wild, and
! visionary, that no sane man-could suppose it sus-
j ceptible of accomplished perfection; that it is one
i of those delusive visions which loom up from the
| face of the waters before they begin to move, in
anticipation of a presidential election storm; and,
like them, disappears before a steady gaze, at the
rising swell of the true tempest.

is the most unwise, unjust, unnatural, unstatesman-

of the northern States. Northern gentlemen tell
