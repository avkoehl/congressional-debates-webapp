CAPTAIN: The enemy has vedettes about two miles from this point, on the southeast side of the railroad (toward Dalton), and perhaps a light battery in position. He appears loth to show his force, and under present instructions I do not feel authorized to compel him. If desirable, I think we could induce him to develop without serious danger to ourselves. Please instruct, and oblige your obedient servant,
