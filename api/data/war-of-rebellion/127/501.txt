to avoid all difficulty and trouble we insisted on knowing what he considered "a reasonable freight. " He said Mr. Cahuzac informed him it could be done for $2,000 or less. We then assured Colonel Lewis the price named was so much below what we could get it done for we solicited him to make the shipping arrangements himself, and we would renounce one-third of our commission (2 1\2 per cent.). He informed us he was not authorized to do anything of the kind. We then assured him that we would show him all the samples, assist him in everything in our power, and renounce the whole of our commission if he would take upon himself the shipping of the goods, so great was our anxiety for our country to have what we could get, or get to the extent of the credit. This proposition he declined, but not without his remarking that it would be far better to purchase a vessel and ship the goods than to pay any such price as we had led him to believe would have to be paid. We at no time having named any given price or sum of freight required, the impracticability of such a thing we very quickly demonstrated to him, and so the matter was left for the night, as far as he was concerned. After parting with Colonel Lewis, 8. 30 p. m., we sought out the captain we had selected for our business, explained to him the embarrassments by which we were surrounded in relation to shipping, and asked his advice. His reply was that he would give us his reply and views this morning, July 20, which he has done, and here is a copy thereof, the original of which is annexed to this report, and is truly worthy of your consideration:

HAVANA, July 20, 1861.

Messrs. J. E. CHALARD and

W. G. BETTERTON:

GENTLEMEN AND DEAR SIRS: In consideration of my regard for the Southern Confederacy, I agree to take charge of a vessel to be loaded with arms and munitions of war and safely deliver the same within the limits of the Southern Confederacy, and leave the compensation to the liberality and good judgment of the President, the Hon. Jefferson Davis, and his honorable Cabinet.

Yours, very respectfully,

A. L. BAPTISTA,

Captain.
