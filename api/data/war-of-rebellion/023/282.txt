NASHVILLE, August 7, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Can the charges against Colonel Campbell, Sixty-ninth Ohio, provost guard, be withdrawn by those preferring them, and Colonel Campbell permitted to resign? I am desired to ask this by all parties interested in the regiment, the colonel himself wishing it if the resignation be dated three weeks ahead and he have leave of absence to start another regiment.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Governor Johnson and Colonel Miller have both conversed with me, urging that the Sixty-ninth Ohio be relieved from provost-marshal duty here, and another regiment and another provost-marshal be substituted. The regiment is in low condition as to conduct and discipline.

Colonel MILLER, Nashville:

Guards will have to go with every train. Can you not make up parties of convalescent for guards? They will only have to ride on the cars.

COLUMBIA, August 7, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

The party of guerrillas, between 300 and 400, reported to you yesterday at Kinderhook, attacked the mail train this morning 12 miles south of Spring Hill at 9 a.m., having first placed a large number of ties in the road. Two hundred balls were fired into the wood and iron work of the locomotive. The brakemen was wounded with four balls. Twelve passengers, citizens and soldiers, were wounded. The engine forced the obstructions off the track and came to this place under high speed.

JAS. S. NEGLEY,

General.
