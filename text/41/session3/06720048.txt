not, Mr. Speaker; and yet the argument of
"discipline1' proceeds upon this ground too
often, I fear. But one thing is certain: that
in 'every other navy efficiency and discipline
are both secured by the concession of rank,
positive and fixed, and of a high grade, to the
members of the staff corps. The following
table will show the position of the staff in for-
eign navies. Let the reader examine, and
then censure, if he can, the sense of justice
which asks at our hands a similar recognition

"In the Russian navy mecflcal officers attain the
highest military rank known: they receive an in-
crease of pay every five years, and enjoy the same
honors and pensions as the line.
"In the British navy medical officers attain the rank
of vice admiral; tho-y receive the same decorations,
&c., as the line, tho director general of the medical
department being a K. C. B., and seven of them are
honorary physicians and surgeons to tho queen.
"In the Spanish navy medical officers attain the
rank of vice admiral, (teniente general;) they enjoy
equally with tho line naval honors, rewards, and pen-
sions, and count seven years on entering for tho time
occupied in studying their profession.
"In the French navy medical officers attain the
rank of rear admiral, (contre amiral.) The surgeon-
in-chiefof a French squadron is allowed table money,
and messes with tho commander-in-chief.
"In tbs Austrian navy medical officers attain the
rank of rear admiral, (contre admiral;) they wear the
same uniform, enjoy the same privileges, and receive
the sarno retiied pay as the line.
"In the Batch navy the senior medical officer
(inspecteur) has the rauk of major general, and the
diriarrend ojficier v<tn gezondhaid that of brigadier.
"In the United States Army medical officers enjoy
every rank, from firstlieutenantto brigadier general.
The Surgeon General is a brevet major general, and
nine surgeons are brevet brigadier generals. Their
rank is positive, well-defined, universally acknowl-
edged and carries with it the uniform, pay, right to
quarters, and every other incident to rank except
military command in the line."
HISTORY OP THE CONTROVERSY—CHARACTER OP THE
STAFF.
We thus find our Navy in its organization far
behind all others in liberalization and improve-
ment, with strong tendencies to go backward.
This condition of.things has for many years
been felt and manfully struggled against by the
staff. For many years in the earlier history
of onr Navy the struggle was confined to the
medical staff. For many years they were the
champions for the principle and policy of ad-
vancement embodied in this bill, struggling
alone against their anamolous and degrading
position. It is a matter of credit, however, to
the Navy that their views received the support
of several distinguished officers of the line, as
they did two years ago that of the li bravest
of the brave,n Admiral Farragut. I would be
*Not a distinct grade.
glad, had I time, to bring to the attention of the
House all the memorials and tributes of these
brave old heroes of the sea in behalf of justice
to the medical officers of the Navy. I regret
to be compelled to add, however, that these
attempts were resisted by the younger and less
considerate officers of the line. Though some-
thing was obtained out of these struggles, it
fell far short of what was due to their standing
and services.
CHARACTER OP THE STAFF CORPS.
Mr. Speaker, it is easy, I think, for a pro*
fessional man to see why the medical corps of
the Navy should be placed on the same footing
of consideration and rank that is enjoyed by
their brethren in the Army. The naval sur-
geon must be a man of sound mental organ-
ization and high attainments. He must have
passed successfully through the school of let-
ters and of medicine. He must stand well in
a profession whose members in civil life are
the masters of material science. In the office
to which he devotes himself he is intrusted
with the highestduties which can connect him
with the welfare of his fellow-man. Thehealth
and the lives of the officers and crew of the
ship are in his keeping. His field is a broad
one, for it embraces every climate and zone.
It is his duty to know and determine the most
important matters relating to the physical wel-
fare of all around him. He must be master
of health and hygiene. He must compass that
intricate and subtile knowledge of the won-
derful organization of man through which he
becomes the master of that art of surgery
which is the crowning glory of his profession.
Nature will make a man a good fighter, obser-
vation and experience may make him a good
sailor; but the man who would successfully
heal and cure must call to his aid the strong
brain, the steady hand, the accomplishments
of study, and the courage which knows no
faltering. The medical corps of the Navy, as
well as of the Army, have adorned and illus-
trated their profession while they have devoted
themselves with patriotism to the service of
their country.
We have also a corps of paymasters, num-
bering some one hundred and twenty-five,
drawn from the mercantile departments of life,
educated at their own expense, trusted for
their integrity, their business habits, and qual-
ifications, upon whom are cast a variety of
duties, requiring exactness, pronjptness, and
good judgment. They come into the Navy as
the representatives of the great business world,
are clothed with large responsibilities, for the
discharge of which they are compelled to give
ample security to the Government to an extent
which cannot fail to test and establish their
good standing as citizens and business men in
the communities from which they are selected.
They receive and disburse the moneys of the
Government; they discharge the dues of the
Government to its officers and men; they
make the enormous purchases which supply
the demands of the Navy. They are at.once
quartermasters, commissaries, and paymas-
ters. They, also, in common with the sur-
geons and engineers, come into the Navy at
mature years, representing a republican citi-
zen element of'the best character.
# Within thirty years the extensive introduc-
tion of steam into the Navy has demanded the
employment and organization of a corps of
engineers, an intelligent, educated, skilful!, and
vigorous membership, essential to the success-
ful working of the Navy. They come from
our schools, academies, colleges, and work-
shops, trained in art and in letters, bringing
with them that self-respect and force and
independence of character which marks the
educated American citizen.
^ In social standing, in mental capacity, and
m culture they are at least the equals of their
contemporaries of the line, and in all that
