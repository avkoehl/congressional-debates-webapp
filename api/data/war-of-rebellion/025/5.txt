CORINTH, June 12, 1862.

Major-General McCLERNAND, Bethel:

It is reported that some 500 rebel cavalry are marching on Decaturville, Decatur Country, to burn the cotton at that place. The gunboat Robb has been ordered down the river for its protection. You will move a sufficient cavalry force, with an infantry and artillery reserve, from Jackson or vicinity in the direction of Decaturville to cut off their retreat. If you capture any of these incendiaries you will order a commissioned to try them and immediately carry into execution the sentence. Give them summary justice.

Move up to Jackson any part of your division you may require there.

CAMP NEAR BOONEVILLE, June 12, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

A spy whom I sent some days ago to Okolona has just returned. The enemy is scattered along the whole road from Columbus to Tupelo, 16 miles below Guntown. They are disorganized, mutinous, and starving. He reports the woods full or deserters belonging to the northern counties of Mississippi. Nearly the whole of the Tennessee, Arkansas, and Kentucky troops have left. A large rear guard has been strung along perpendicular to the road for 20 miles, driving the stragglers and all the cattle of every description before them. The spy reports that the whole army is utterly demoralized an dread to throw down their arms; the Alabama troops have heard of Wood's and Negley's movements and are clamorous to go home. From all accounts I do not doubt the utter disintegration of Beauregard's army. A small rear guard is at Tupelo, 16 miles south of Guntown, and the nearest troops to us of the enemy. My command is now encamping here and will be in position by sunset.

Major-General HALLECK:

If any portion of Beauregard's army has left this country, except the numerous deserters who have returned to their homes, the testimony of agents and deserters is worthless. I myself do not doubt that of what is left of his army two-thirds are now scattered along the road to Columbus, for 60 miles, in no condition of service anywhere. Beauregard may possibly have 35,000 reliable troops, though I consider that a large estimate, but they are fully occupied in securing his rear, protecting the artillery and supplies, and preventing the entire dispersion of the remainder. Without abandoning everything they have except their arms no considerable portion of them can now be transferred elsewhere. Such, at least, is my opinion from all the information I can obtain.

You will take post with your brigade and battery of artillery at Rienzi. As you will probably occupy that position for some time you
