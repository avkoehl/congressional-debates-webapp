WEST GULF SQUADRON, U. S. FLAG-SHIP STOCKDALE, Off Blakely Bar, [April 1,] 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Army and Division of West Mississippi:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of this day's date, accompanied by the chart representing in pencil lines a means of communication from Mobile with Fort Tracy. I will have it watched as you desire, and as the moon is on the increase we hope to be able to see an approaching boat a long distance. It appears to me that those now in Fort Alexis and adjacent works must soon exhaust their ammunition and provisions, and if all relief is cut off from the city you must soon have them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. K. THATCHER,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HDQRS. ARMY OF DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, April 1, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY:

The general desires that you inquire from the admiral if he has any 100-pounder Parrotts with carriages that he would loan us for a few days.

C. T . CHRISTENSEN,Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

U. S. FLAG-SHIP STOCKDALE, April 1, 1865.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In reply to your note of this day I am sorry to say that we have no 100-pounder Parrotts with carriages, except those mounted on pivot slides on board one or two gun-boats, and those on board the iron-clad Cincinnati. There are two or three of that caliber at New Orleans, but, I believe, without carriages.

I am, very respectfully,

H. K. THATCHER,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, Near Spanish Fort, Ala., April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. G. SAWTELLE,Chief Quartermaster, Mil. Div. of West Miss., Fort Gaines, Ala.:

SIR: The commanding general desires that all tools that have been called for and many bee called for by Brigadier-General Beiley, commanding Engineer Brigade, be furnished and forwarded with the least possible delay. He reports to the chief engineer:

The entrenching tools called for are not here. Every day for the last four day I have sent to Fort Gaines for them, and although boats arrive every day, they have not yet come to hand. As soon as they do I shall forward them without delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
