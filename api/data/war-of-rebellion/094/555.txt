COMMANDING OFFICER,

Bridgeport:

Lyon's rebel command was severely repulsed at Scottsborough last night, and is reported this morning flying southeast toward Gunter's Ferry. If you have any transports at Bridgeport, or can any, by all means move a force down the river and cut him off. We must capture or destroy his force. I will have forces pressed down on his rear. If Commodore Forrest is at Bridgeport, or you can communicate with him, give him this information and ask him to please patrol all the river in the neighborhood of Gunter's Ferry, Larkin's Landing. &c.
