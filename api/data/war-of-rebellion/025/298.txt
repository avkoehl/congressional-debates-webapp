The general commanding being called by superior authorities to duty elsewhere, begs leave to bid an affectionate good-by to the officers and men of his command. It is his extreme pleasure to be able to declare truthfully he will not bear away a single painful, personal feeling toward any one of his command, and trusts that for any severity he may have exercised or any feelings he may have wounded he will be pardoned, attributing it to human frailty and sincere desire for the good of the service and the honor of those who serve our country.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

Governor YATES, Springfield, Ill.:

Helena and other points held by us on the Mississippi are seriously threatened, and you are requested to send there all available troops in Illinois with the least possible delay. They should first report to General Grant, at Columbus, and if not required there they will proceed to Helena.

Major-General GRANT, Jackson, Tenn.:

The Governor of Illinois has been directed to send you as many troops as possible. General Curtis is begging for re-enforcements to be sent to Helena. Be prepared to concentrate your troops in case of an attack.

For a cartel-ship to receive deserters is a violation of the laws of war.
