ate established, or are in progress, era y where Public woiks
are projected and pushed foiward m a spirit, w nch grasps at
hign and vast objects, with a bold defiance oí all expense The
aggregate value of the property of the country is augmented
tidily A constant demand ioi new capital exists, although a
debt h- salieady been contiacted in Europe, ioi sums advanc
ed to States, corporation^ and individuals, foi purposes con
nected with internal improvement, which d bt cannot now'be
less than a hundred millions ofdollars Spreading overa great
extentembracingdiffeient climates, and with vast vauety of
pioduets, we find an intensely excited spirit of nidusdy and en
teipuse to peivd.de the whole countiy, while its external com
mere?, at, I have already said sweeps ovei all seas Wc are
connected with all commercial countries, and, must of ail, with
that, which ha5! established and sustained the most stupendous
system of commerce and manufactures, and which collects and
t'isbursps an incredible amount of annual revenue; and which
use13, to this end, and as mean^of currency and circulation, a
mixed money oi metal and paper
^uch a mixed system, sn, has also prevailed with us, from
the beginning Gold and silver, and convenible bank paper,
have always constituted our actual money The people are
used to this system It has hithei to commanded their confi
('enoe, an 1 fulhlled the t expectation1! We have had, in sut
cession, two Psafionii Banks, each foi a period o( twenty years
Loral 01 ¡state banks have, at the same time, been m operation,
and no man of intelligence or candoi can deny that, duiing
these fouy yeais, and with the operation of a national and
these State institutions, the cuirency of the countiy, upon the
whole, has been sale, cheap, convenient, and satisiactoiy
When the Government wis estihnshed, it fouid conveitible
bank papei, issued by State banks, altead} m circulation, and
with thib cuculation it did not mteifeie The United States,
ind cd, had themselves established a bank, under the old Con
fe 'oration, with authoiity to isbue papei A system of mixed
circulation, t lerefore, was exactly that system which this Con
o initio i, at its adoption, found already in existence There is
ii >t the slightest evidence of any intention, n establishing the
Constitution, to overthiew or abolish this system, altnough it
certainly was the object of the Constitution to abolish bills of
cied.t, and all paper intended fot cuculation, issued upon tite
faith of the States alone Inasmuch as whatever then existed,
o! the niture of money or cunency, rested on State legislation,
and as it was not possible that unifoimity, general credit,
and gencial confidence, could íe&ult fiom local and sepaiatc
acts of the Slates theie is evidence-—Í think abundant evi
deuce-—-that it was the intention of the hameisof the Constitution
to rnve to Con0ie s a couUulb ig power ovei the whole subject,
to tne en i tint the e ■-non id be, foi the wno!e cou d.y a cui

Government With intervals of derangement, brought about
by war and othet occuriences, this whole system, taken
altogether, has been greatly successful m its actual ope«atinn
We have found occasion to create no difference between
Go eminent and people—between money for revenue, and
in iry foi the general use of the country Until the com
mencement oí th^ last session, Government had manifested
no disposition to look out foi itself txclueively What
w is good enough foi the people, was good enough foi Gu

Rev ilutiiiiaiy put&oiei , md the vauous classesof laboieis in

Imongh oui whole hisi/ny, s l, we have found ¿convenible
pa1? r cmrency, under piopet contiol, highly useful, by its pli
ability to cm um^tance^, and by its rapae.ty of eulaigement,

dent lo eveiy one, that so long as, by a safe use ol papei, we
give some lea-sonable expandí m t  oui own eircul ition, or at

cieate ot maintain an abiluy lot loans among ouiselves, and &o

liu let me'now, ¡Mi President, ask theattention of the Se
nate to anotan subject upon which, indeed, much has already
beei stid, I mean tha' which is usually called the eiedit
y stem
¡su, wnatis that system * Why is a edit a woid of so much
s)hl imputance, and or so pnvtrful <hatm, in the Lmted
Sae^l Why i it thitasiioel has been felt thiough all ci is-^es

pci able, an 1 mingle it moie ivnui illy, moie mtima'eiy, with

A toll anl philosophical answci to these inquiries, Mi Pre^i
dent would dem in J that I should set forth both thegiound woik
and the structure of oui social system Itwould showthatthe
weatu md [UJspeiity of the countiy have as bioad a foundation
ri-, ita popular cons uutions Undoubtedly theie are peculian

th!y jive to t iedit, or to those means md those ariangemenf!,
by whatever nimes we ca I them, which aie calculated to keep
the whole, oi by fir the greater part, of the capital of the coun
tjy m astateofconstantactivity, adegieecf ímpoitancefai ex
ceedmg what is experienced elsewhere
In th.e old countries of Europe theie is a cleai and well deim
edline} between capital md labor a line whieh strikes through
bociety w ith a horizontal sweep, leaving on one side wealth, m
masses, holden by few hands, and those having little participa
tion in the laborious pursuits of life, on the other, the thronging
multitudes of labor, with here and there, only, an instance of
of such accumulation ©f catnhlgs as td deserve the name of
capital fh s distinct!on,|mdeed, is not universal and absolute
m any of the commercial States of Europe, and it grows less
and le&s definite as commerce advances, theeffect of commerce
and minufactuies, as ail history shows, being, every where, to
diffuse wealth and not to aid its accumulauon in few hands
But still the line is greatly moie broad marked, and visible to
Eui opean nations, than m the Imite J states In those nations,
the gains ol capital and v?age^, or the earnings of labor, are
not on y distinct m idea, as elements of the science of political
economy, but, to a gieat degiee, al o,distmct m fact, and their
respective claims, and meats, and modes of íelative adjustment,
become subjects of discussion and of public íearulation Aow,
sir, every body may se mat that is a state of things which does
not exist with us We have no such, visible and broad distmc
tion between capital and labor, and much of the general hap
piness of all classes results from this With us, labor is every
day augmenting its means by its own industry, not in all coses,
indeed, butin very many Its savings ofyesteiday become its
capital, theiefoie of to day On the other band vastly the
greatei portion of the piopeity of tfeecotntiy exists m &uch
small quantities that its holdeis cannot dispense altogether with
their own petsonal in lustry, or if, in some m^tanc"?, capital
be accumulated till it uses to what may be ca led affluence, it
is usually di integrated; md broken into part c es again, m one oi
two geneiatioi The abolition ui the rights of primogeniture,
the desi ent of piopcrty of eveiy sort ol females as Well as
males, the cheap and ea^y means by which property is tisns
feired and conveyed, the high puce ot labor the low pnce
oí land, the £reiiiu-> of our political institutions, in fine,
eveiy thug belonging to us, countfracts Jaree accumulatioi
This ib oui actualsystem Out politics, our Constitutions, our
elemental y laws, oui habits all ccntie in this point, oi tend to
thKi^ult Fiomwheie 1 now ?tan 1, to the extremity of the
northeast, vastly the greatest pait oí the property of the conn

tiy, suchas iieverbeioiepeivaded any society, are thechatic
teimics which di tmsmsh the people who live, and move, and
act in this s ate ol things such as I have described it
Novv, s r, il this view be tute as I think it is, all must perceive
that, m the United Mites,, capital cannot siy to Iaboi and mdus

we adopt a system that withdraws capital fiom active employ
