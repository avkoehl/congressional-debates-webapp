building interests. In order to carry out the pur-
poses of this amendment, and to put upon these
several lines the steamers which are necessary,
it would be needed to build immediately in this
country four large iron screw steamships of
from five thousand to fifty five hundred tons'
burden. Within five years twelve more of
them will be needed; and as many more, of
from two thousand to twenty five hundred
tons' burden, for the branches.
Now, then, as to freight. These steamers gen-
erally bring to San Francisco from two thou-
sand to twenty-five hundred tons of freight.
One steamer, in October last, brought thirty-
three hundred tons of tea, silk, porcelain, &c.
While as outgoing freight they carry flour,
quicksilver, fruits, and vegetables, manufac-
tured articles of all kinds, and large quantities
of ginseng from Ohio and Baltimore. One
hundred tons of clocks went out in one steamer.
Iron and iron manufactures, sewing-machines,
steam fire-engines, carriages, and all the mis-
cellaneous articles which our manufacturers
are able to produce, are exported by this line.
Why is it necessary that this line should have
a subsidy? The monthly line is now a stable
institution to the extent to which it is run.
When it was first put on in 1867, the line be-
tween Panama and San Francisco was still
running profitably, the surplus profits of which
each year amounted to §2,000,000. That
amount was sunk to sustain the line between
China and Japan. That resource is now taken
from the company by the completion of the
overland railroad, which has brought the pas-
sengers and freight that formerly went by that
line, and now prevents the realization of those
profits which were applied for this purpose.
But, furthermore, this trade is a matter of
development. Although to put on this addi-
tional service would cost about ninety-five per
cent, of the amount which it now costs to run
the steamers, yet the trade being a matter of
developement, the extra expenses cannot for
several years be received from the profits of
the trade.
The advantage of this route, from its geo-
graphical position, as against the Suez canal,
is this: the time of a round voyage is seventy-
two days, or four trips a year. From Shang-
hae to London or Liverpool and back, the
time is one hundred and fifty days, or two trips
a year. In fact it is less than that number of
profitable trips, because the tea season lasts
or only a portion of the year. There is now
only the freighting business on that English
line, as the mails and passengers go by the
Peninsular and Oriental line. The English
subsidy to this latter line is £450,000, or
$2,250,000 a year, or seven per cent, upon
the capital invested, while the company pays
but five or six per cent, of dividends. It
is by means of these subsidies that England
has been able to build up and make strong
these great lines which carry its manufactured
articles to all parts of the world, and bring
back enriching tides of commerce among her
own people. The first contract with that
Peninsular line was made in 1845. The last
was made in 1870, and does not expire until
1880.
Now, sir, there is a financial side to this
question, so far as our Treasury is concerned.
It is shown by the statistics that the amount
of increase of duties or customs at San Fran-
cisco alone, while the customs from such
sources have not decreased at our other prin-
cipal ports, have been $3,256,998, while the
whole amount that the Government has paid
out during the five years this subsidy has been
paid is only $2,500,000. So that the profit
made to the Treasury, to say nothing of the
great advantages which have accrued to our
people in an outlet for their manufactures, has
been $756,998, showing that the Treasury itself
has been replenished by making this subsidy.

sults to the Government:

In 1871 the United States inland rates on
foreign mails in transit were reduced one half,
which accounts for the less postage, and
yet the figures show the great comparative
increase.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. WOOD. If I were to consult the inter-
ests of those who are the most prominent and
enterprising capitalists in the city of New
York, I should support this proposition. If I
were to follow the impulses of my own feel-
ings, laying aside my duty as a Represent-
ative, I would freely second the proposition
so ably supported by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia, [Mr. Sargent.] But believing that I
am here as one of the trustees of the public
Treasury, that I have been placed here to dis-
charge a high official trust, I cannot, consist-
ently with my oath of office and my own sense
of duty, vote to give another $500,000 a year
to this steamship line.
I recognize the great importance of this
steamship line ; I recognize the fact that it is
one of the finest lines that to-day float upon
either the Atlantic or the Pacific ocean ; I
recognize the fact that it is opening up to this
country a valuable trade, which in time will
become of great importance, probably of as
much importance as is now the European trade
to the Atlantic coast. But in view of the fact
that the people of this country are already
borne down by taxation; in view of the fact
that this is but the pioneer subsidy proposition,
but the entering-wedge into the public Treas-
ury, which is to precede a multitude of similar
propositions from all kinds of lines, running
on the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, as
well as on the Pacific, for bounties and subsi-
dies also, I cannot, consistently with my views
of duty, vote for this proposition.
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.
Dawes] has told us of the importance of this
trade. He has told us of the freights from
which we already derive large revenue on ac-
count of our trade with Japan, China, and the
East Indies. He has established by his own
argument that this line must already be in
receipt of enough income from a legitimate
source, over and above any aid from the Gov-
ernment. We liavealready given them $500,000
a year; we have done that by act of Congress.
And here, surreptitiously, improperly, and un-
justly, it is sought to putin an appropriation
bill for the ordinary and legitimate expendi-
tures of tho Post Office Department what is
tantamount to the passage of a new law to
double the subsidies already paid by the Gov-
ernment.
Now, if we are to grant these favors, let as
grant them universally. Let us give every
private interest in the country money from the
public Treasury. Let us give aid to the agri-
cultural interest, to the trading interest, to the
interest of the laboring men, to the manufac-
turing interests, as well as to the great navi- -
gating interest. I am in favor of the com-
merce of my country; but I remember that
ships are but articles of manufacture and con-
struction as houses are; that while they do
the carrying trade of the country, they have
no part or parcel in the great foreigu com-
merce of the country.
I make a distinction between the carrying
trade and the great commercial importing
and exporting elements of industry. Sir, this
proposition is wrong in principle; it is danger-
ous as a precedent; it is in contravention of
our oath of office; it is a profligate, wasteful,
unjust, and I had almost said dishonest, appro-
priation of the public money. I hope that the
House will not sanction it.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate on the pending
amendment is exhausted.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I move, pro
forma, to amend the amendment by adding
to the amount one dollar. Mr. Chairman, I
regret to differ with my colleague, [Mr. Wool),]
with whom I so seldom disagree. In this case
I am sorry that his judgment did not accord
with his feelings. He told us that his feelings
were in favor of this appropriation. I shall
address myself now not only to his feelings
but to his head.
I go for this subsidy in behalf of my coun-
try. The struggle is one for the trade of
685,000,000 human beings—35,000,000 in
Japan, 400,000,000 in China, 100,000,000 in
India, 100,000,000 in Borneo, Sumatra, the
Phillipine and other islands of the great
Indian ocean. The question is between us
and Great Britain, our commercial enemy, as
to which shall have this commerce. Great
Britain appropriates $2,500,000 to subsidize
her steamers running from the port of South-
ampton to Yokohama in Japan, to China, and
throughout all the Indian ocean. The ques-
tion is whether we shall yield this commerce
to Great Britain or whether we shall struggle
for it.
Sir, war is not by arms alone. It is not
carried on merely by guns, orcannon, or sword,
or bayonet. There are wars more dignified
and far more noble than those of artillery.
There are wars of ships, of commerce, of
trade, of navigation. The struggle now is for
the supremacy of the ocean. " Britannia rules
the wave j" and it is only our country that can
wrest the trident from her grasp. In this war
of our country with Great Britain for the trade
of 635,000,000 human beings, my feelings, to
say nothing of my judgment, prompt me to
stand on the side of my country. Hence I
differ with my colleague on this subject.
Sir, it was my fortune, or misfortune, to see
something of the struggle which has been
going on upon those seas during the last sum-
mer. Our flag on this steamship line already
floats from San Francisco to Yokohama and
the inland seas of Japan and China, and is
carried thence almost to the very gates of
Pekin, while throughout all Japan it floats,
without an appropriation whatever, as far north
as Hakodadi, and with a tendency to stretch
to the waters of the Russian sea.
I beg the House, without distinction of party,
to look upon this question not only as a mere
question of money or of subsidy, but as a
struggle for the supremacy of the eastern sea.
Such is the superiority of our ships and our
sailors, and the captains who command them
in the East, that if we do not allow ourselves
to be borne down by the subsidies of England ;
if you will give this enterprise, not $2,500,000,
which the British Government gives its com-
pany, but less than one half that sum, I pledge
