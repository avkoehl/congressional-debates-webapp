Richmond papers of to- day recived. The following items are sent:

FROMNORTH CAROLINA.

Ther was a rumor on the streets yesterday that Geenral Johnston had attacked Sheman in his intrenchments at Bentonville and drriven him out of them. We have received no official intelligence confimatory of the rumor, and for this and other reasons doubt that here is foundation to it.
