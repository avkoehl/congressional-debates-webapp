Your dispatch is recived. My camp indicates two roads striking the railroad about midway between Goldsborough and Moseley Hall. I thought if these roads exist I would send a division fromlhere to cover them. I have sent Captain Lord to see. Your patrolling is very well.

Colonel CAMPBELL:

Twenty- five rebel horsemen attacked a party of the Twelfth New york to- day at the intersection of moseley Hall and Snow Hill road with the Goldsborough and Snow Hill raod four miles this side of altter place. The rebels were run off. I have an idea they were O'Conner's party. A half dozen of Shemqan's foragers were carried off by them. Otherwise everything seems to be quiet on my front.

Negroes reported 200 cavalry beyond Contentnea Creek. I find to- day easy roads to Best's Station, on my left, and General Stiles on my right. My pickets ectend now to Snow Hill and Hookerton, but, of course, are not very strong.
