TUPELO, MISS., January 17, 1865.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

I am fully satisfied the Army of Tennessee requires immediate reorganization and consolidation, removing at same time all inefficient and supernumerary officers. Generals Hood, Taylor, Forrest, and corps commanders agree fully with me in that opinion. Cannot necessary authority be granted me,a t once, to the effect? The army cannot otherwise be made reliable for active operations.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

TUPELO, MISS., January 17, 1865.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

To divide this small army at this juncture to re-enforce General Hardee would expose to capture Mobile, Demopolis, Selma, Montgomery, and all the rich valley of the Alabama River. Shall that risk be now incurred?

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

TUPELO, MISS., January 17, 1865.

Honorable WILLIAM PORCHER MILES, M. C.,

Richmond, Va.:

I beg yourself and friends in Congress to support actively the plan I have to-day recommended by telegraph to the President relative to this army. Generals Hood, Taylor, Forrest, and corps commanders agree fully with me in the absolute necessity of the measure.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
