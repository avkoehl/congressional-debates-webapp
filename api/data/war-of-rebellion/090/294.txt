the enemy and the night march to Woodstock met with no further opposition. The division went into bivouac beyond that town at daylight next morning on ground assigned it by the corps commander. I inclose two lists of casualties, showing the loss of the division on each day. It may be well to add that, notwithstanding the severe lists of casualties on the 19th, there are now but three men missing from the division. I also inclose copies of the reports of my brigade commanders, to which I would respectfully call attention.

The Third Brigade of this division took no part in either action, being on detached duty of Harper's Ferry.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major D. S. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
