I would here mention the valuable assistance which Captain Lord, of the Fourteenth Illinois, and assistant commissary of musters on General Stoneman's staff, rendered me, not only in the engagement of the 31st ultimo, where he exhibited great gallantry and bravery in leading a portion of my command several times in the charges made on the enemy, but also on my retreat in obtaining information in regard to the best route to be taken, and in constantly leading the advance of my command.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel Fourteenth Illinois Vol. Cavalry, Commanding Brigadier

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of the Ohio, near Atlanta, Ga.
