Fiscal Bank —Mr. Hubard.
to purely agricultural purposes The only material
improvement which has, during the last fifty years,
taken place m Virginia— her having become one
of the first wheat-growing States,—cannot be asm ibed
to her banks I,i every other respect, what has she
gained by the circulation of bank notes i and what
progress has she made, «¡mce the introduction of
banks, in agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or
population 1 The situation of ihe planters who
cultivate the fresh and fertile soil of Alabama and
of Mississippi affords an irrefragable proof of the
calamities inflicted on an agricultural country by
an exaggerated banking system and by excessive
issues "
The friends of the bank prove by their course
here that they do not consider the constitutional
question as " res adjudícala " If so, why this odi
ous attempt at compromise 1 Why this pompous
parade of great names' Why this attempt to show
that some lepublicans sustained the bank in liSlb1
When gentlemen leave the constitutional argument,
to hunt up precedents, and take refuge behind great
names, aoesit not prove that they have not an abid
mgfanh mthuroun abilitj to'how to the coun
try that Congress has the power to establish a bank i
It is notorious that some persons are in fa\ or of a
bank to regulau the exchanges and facilitate trade,
others desire one simply as a fiscal agent of thei
Federal Government, wni'e many, no doubt, agree
with Getietal A Hamilton, that a bank is a "polit-
ical machine of the highest impoitance to the Slate "
Thus, we infer from the purposes for which a bank
is designed, that there must be seveial clauses in
the federal constitution giving Congress the power,
m the estimation of its li tends, to incorpora e one
But the Federal Government is a delegated and
limited trust, it does not p issess sovereignty, which
is that power which governs in the last resort—that
which has the acknowledged right to alter or ab
rogate an existing foi not government, and estab-
lish another of such a chaiacte - as the people m ly
deem necessary Sovereignty recognises no earlhlv
superior In our country, it is original m the peo
pie, who m es abhsbing the Federal Government,
did not din «t themselves, ot a particle The idea
of sovereigi tv niports that you may exercise pow-
er wheii\o\i «ill and how you will, it includes a
right to any means and oil the means applicable to
the attainment oi the object But this is not the
charactei of the Federal Government The pow
ersgtamei aie defined ard limned The ninth
amendment of th" constitution decíales that "the
enumeration in the constituí on of certain rights
shall not be constiued to deny or disparage otheis
retained by the people," an 1 "the powers (tenth
amendment) no'delegated to the United States by
this cons ltution, nor prohibited by it lo ihe States,
are reseivel to tne States respectn "ly, or to the
people" It is only npcessary to read the constitu-
tion to find that ii is a delegation of specific poiv-

necessary to its e\ec ution f   The power to "com
money' implies a ugh' to erect a mint, as an inci-
dental power necessary to ihe execution of the au
tjiouty to coin money , bull dots not jmph that a
bank may be established to issue paper money to
serve as a substitute for metallic monei     Indeed,
the direct tendency of a bank is to mtl'ifv tlic eni^
and purposes for which tne power to coin money
and regulate its value was intrusted to the rei'«ial
Government, benu^  the paper money of a na
tionalbank banishes fiom circulation the precious
metals coined at the mint     The late  Bank of the
United States exported a large amount of specie,
and  a new bank  would  probably do the same
When the notes of a bank are leceivable in pay-
H. ot Rep¿
ment of the public dues, the precious metals will
disappear as a circulating medium
Surejy the pc wer to incorporate a bank cannot
be derived from the clause to lay and collect taxes;
because a bank does neither the one nor the other,
but can only be used as the depository of the reve-
nue after it has been levied and collected Neither
is it incidental to the power to regulate c ommeree;
for it is a machine c early to manufacture the stim
uli,and to afford commercial facilities, together with
a medium of circulation Indeed, it must be ad-
mitted by politicians on ait sides, that a single na-
tional bank must inevitably concerníate, m a great
degree, the ti ide of the country at some favored
points , and therefore clash w ith that provision m
the constitution which provides that no preference
shall be given by any regulation af commerce to the
ports oí one State over t1 ose ot anothei iNoris
the power to incorporate a bank fniriv dedueible
from thar clause which speaks of the "general wel-
faie ," foi that must have b 'en used as a p'irase de-
scribing the pii'poses for which the delegated pow-
ers weie confe red, and not as a distinct grant giv-
en to supply w atever defects politicians might sup-
pose to exist m the list of ihe enumerated powers.
Mr Madison, in his report of 1800 in reletting to
the clause " necessary and proper," observed "It
is not a grant of new poveis to Congress, but merely
a declaration, foi the lemoval of all unceiUmty,
that the means of carrying into execution those
otherwise grarted are included in the grant " All
the powers of Congress can be earned into execu-
tion without a Bank of the United States v hich is
not necessary or proper, and therefore unauthorized
by this clause which has been so strongly lehed
upon by those friendly to a bank
Thus, upon examination, we find the fnends of
a bank deriving the power to incoipoiate from
various sources, though none of ihem ait willing
to trust the issue to any one clause Indeed it may
emphatically ' e < haracten/ed as a ' \ ¡iiant" pow-
er, and one neither tangible nor visible 't the
powei of intoi poration is fmly de luc ihle trom any

But some gentlemen on the opposite side preterí
that the constitution-^ question is settle I     In sup
DOitof this cip mon   thev refer n- to the fief thi

as the two ac s of incorporation    But n addjln
to the above facts, the people haie elected JefFersoi
Madison, Jack°on, Van Buien, and Hamson,—all
of whom were declared enemies to the hanks incor-
porated m 1791 and in 1816, and m the elections
of Jackson the second time, and of Van Burea, that
was made a subslantue issue.
But, Mr Chairman, I will not go further into the
constitutional argument, for really it seems to me
that, whatever gentlemen on the other side caa in-
duce themselves to believe expedient, they, by the
same operation, imagine constitutional. 1 wilt,
therefore, take a cursory view of the past conditio^
ol the currency, and endeavoi to show that, if a
regulator were needed, we gained nothing by the
incorporation of a national bank.
In 17J1, when the first United States Bank was
incorporated, we had three State banks, wielding
jointly a capital of $4,550,000. But in January,
1811, just before the charter of the first United
States Bank expired, there were in the United States
eighty eight State banks, with a joint capital of
$4¿,bl0,000 We find, by an examination of the
statement ju.t made, that the federal bank did not
check or repress the spirit for multiplying the State
banks If a national bank could not then exert a
salutary influence on the public mmd, and induce
our State legislators to stop in their mad career,
what good i eason have we for supposing that if
such an institution should now be mcorporated.it
could exert a mors controlling influence upon the
State banks, as well as on the public mind1 Then
the federal bank capital was to the State bank cap-
ital as '2 to 1 , but now it is proposed to be only as
1 to 12 It the federal institution was inefficient
when it had such a tremendous ascendency over the
State banks, I would ask, how can it pretend to
control the latter note, when they have multiplied
to upwards oí nine hundred in number, and wield
jointly a capital of over $358,000,000, together with
loans and discounts to the amount of $462,896,523,
and a paper circulation of$106,9G8,57¿'! We must
remember, also, that the country has enjoyed all
the benefits oí the great regulator, with the excep-
tion ol about four years, from 1791, when we had
only three State banks, down to the present time.
During forty years oí this period, the bank was
conducted under a charter from the Federal Gov-
ernment, and since 1836 under the charter granted
by the State oí Pennsylvania. Upon the reorgan-
ization of tha t bank by the Pennsylvania Legislature
m 1836, Mr Nicholas Biddle not only declared the
ba lie vljci, stronger, and more prosperous than it
na vos, but that " it teas an original misfortune,
tn Inc stiuclvie of ihe bank, that it was m any way
connected villi peisoas in ojjiee The instincts of
al political powei make that association dangerous
—useful to with'i party, injui wus to both." Now,
I put it to iionorable gentlemen to say whether a
more palpable imbecility to accomplish its high
destiny need be adduced, to satisfy any plain, un-
prejudiced man of its inefficiency1 Nor, on the
other hand, can common sense sanction the policy,
that a icgulator, commencing under such flattering
auspices, "ixiAending m such ¿otó disaster and de-
feat, should now be forced on the country The
ev iK ol the paper sy stem of modern days, and the
failuie of the bank to equal public expectation, or
to comp y w ith as charter, were considerations
which could not, from their nature, have been
brought to bear on public opinion in 1791, or even
m lblb But it cannot be hazarding too much to
sav, that, il those long tued and wise patriots could
have realized m in,agination the present condition
oí affairs, oi hate dreamed ol the evils-they were
about entail,ng on the people by introducing the
present j aper system,—nevel—no, never would
they hiv e til en sides with incorporated wealth to
fos'er speculation, ftaud, and vice, at the expense
of the iieai producing classes of the country
Mr C'ltuman, I «ill now advert to another view
of this subject In a report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, il the 12lh February, 1841, I find the
follow tng sta'ements, made m rqily to a call from
the Senate, asking to be informed ot the number
and capital of the banks that have failed m the
United Sta'es since 1789 Annexed is his sum-
mary

Capital of 193 banks, failing between
1811 and 1830
Capital of the 150 banks, of which 140
are 'scertamed to have failed be-
tween 1830 and 1841
