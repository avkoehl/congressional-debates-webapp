Major Hamilton will explain the necessity for the funds, and I hope it will be in the power of your cheif quartermaster and paymaster to supply him with them, and if you cannot that you will send him immediately to Richmond, or whenever the seat of Government may be, to obtain the funds from the Treasury, through the Quartermaster-General's Department.
