Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Major-General WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

I am convinced that the various reports of infantry coming up to Leesburg and through Manassas Gap into the Valley of the Shenandoah are without foundation of truth, originated, by the marching of paroled prisoners in the direction named. Information from Leesburg this morning says there is only some cavalry there. A paroled officer, Lieutenant Wells, of Michigan cavalry, informs me that General Fitzhugh Lee was killed; Ewell lost a leg, and that Colonel Brodhead, Michigan cavalry, was killed on last Saturday.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

Cole scouted to-day as far as Lovettsville, in Loudoun County, without seeing or hearing of the enemy. Captain Foote, Eighth [New York] Cavalry, has just returned from Charlestown, where he has been on a scout with a squadron of cavalry. A mile beyond Charlestown he discovered about five on by infantry. He estimated the number of infantry to be about 2,000. He returned the fire, killing 1 and wounding 2; had 3 horses wounded. A man from Leesburg reports that all day yesterday the enemy's troops were passing through that town westward, but he did not see any artillery.
