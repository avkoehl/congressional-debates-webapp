1848.
THE. CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

These things being so, the first question to my
mind is, why and for what are these additional
forces wanted? And, secondly, where are we to
get the-ways and means to maintain them? It
was said by the honorable Senator from Kentucky
some days since, that our forces had cost the
country, for the last year, p,000 per man. On
the other hand, it is stated by the honorable Sen-
ator from Michigan at $279,000 for a regiment,
only, however, for pay, rations, and clothing,
without allowance for excess of expenditure in a
foreign country. I have examined the subject,
and will submit the calculations that I have made.
How many men have been in the field, on an aver-
age., for the past year ? Not over 30,000. -
Say Scott, on all his lines > 18,000
Taylqr  8,1)00
Santa F6, &c    4,000
30,000
Expenses lastyeaf, (besidesoutstanding claims,) $58,000,030
Deduct ^28,000,000 for ordinary expenses, in-
eluding army and navy or peace establish-
ments   28,000,000
And you have $30,000,000
"Which averages $1,000 per man, besides bounty,
pensions, and so forth. Now, sir, add to the army
the ten regiments now proposed by this bill, and
the bill for volunteers, and you have 95,000 men
in the field; and these proposed measures cannot
but enhance your expenditures twenty million
dollars.
Scott had at Vera Ciuz, 20th March 13.000
He marched 8th April to Cerro Gordo with 11,000
Discharged his volunteers  3,700
Went to Jalapa with • * • •  7,300
Thence to l'erote, leaving gariisons at Jalapa and
Peroto of.  2,000
And entered Pueblawith  5,300
Here he waifed until August 7, for reinforce-
ments; and, according to the Secretary's report,
received there about 5,000 men under the com-
mand of General Pierce. Leaving a garrison in
Puebla of 500, besides the force withdrawn from
Jalapa, he commenced his victorious march to
Mexico with 10,000—took it, established and
maintained himself. Of these 10,000, at least 2,000
were killed, wounded, or disabled, leaving 8,000,
of which only 6,000 entered the city, and dis-
persed the whole Mexican army.
In Tampieo and V>ra Ouz there are probably now... 2,000
At Jalapa. Perote, and Puebla.  5,000
"7^000
Which being deducted from Scott's whole force of
32,156, gives him in Mexico and the country im-
mediately about it, no less than 25,156. At the
last accounts, General Scott was arranging an ex-
pedition from this force—wholly unnecessary for
holding Mexico and its suburbs—to Potosi and
the mining districts of Zacatecas; and, as yet, ;
wisely leaves ducretaro untouched, for theie only j
can be found the remnant of Mcxican authority, j
Probably before this bill can become a law—in-
deed long before this force can reach the Mexican
territory, these mining districts, the wealth of
which the diffidence, of the Senator from Michigan
could not allow him to name—this Eldorado,
which for centurics has been the envy and the ruin
of grasping and unprincipled ambition, will have
yielded to our forces, having nothing to resist
them, and thus Mexico—its mines and its wealth
—its pndc and prowess—its altars and its holy
emblems of faith—its power, and even its national
existence, arc at the foot and the mercy of a con-
quering and triumphant foe. More than we should
desire is ours—and why want more men?
Now, lot us glance at the financial aspect of the
case. We have had in general estimates the
amount supposed to be necessary for the incoming
year. These estimates are predicated upon the
present force now in the field, and are independent
of the troops proposed to be raised by this and the
volunteer bill. The Secietarv of the Treasury
asks for a duty on tea and coffee, to support the
troops and honor of the country. This is sound
doctrine. Let the Administration propose a direct
tax, and prevent the incurring of a debt of more
than a hundred millions.
Sir, I have examined some estimates from the
Treasury Department on the state of our finances,
and the means at our command for carrying on the
war.
By the report of the Secretary, it appears that
you received up to June 30, 1847—
From customs   $28,747,864
Fiom land  2,498,335
Miscellaneous  100,570
Actual receipts  26,346,789 ,
Last six months of tauff of 1842, and first six
months of taxiff of 1846 :
July 1, 1846, there was in the treasury  $9,126,439
Whole resources, except loan and treasury notes, $35,473,228
Expenditures during same fiscal year.... *  59,451,177
Expenses over receipts, not including loans or
treasury notes $93,977,949
Add *$9,128,439 in the treasury, makes  33,104,388
The $9,126,489 in treasury is absorbed and lost,
and a deficiency of $23,997,949 is supplied by-loan,
and is a debt on interest for the country to pay.
The estimated receipts into the treasury for the
year ending June, 1848, are—
From customs (three last quarters estimated)... $31,000,000
From lands ' 3,500,000
Miscellaneous  400,000
34,9^0,000
I propose to reduce for over estimate—
Customs $4,000,000
Lands  1,000,000
Miscellaneous  300,000
 $5,300,000
29,<300,uuu
If the revenue is more, the worse for the country
producing such excessive importations.
Expenditures for year ending June 30, 1848:
By estimate made December, 1816, as per repoit, $45,781,784
Add to this the additional appropriation already
asked for by the Secretaiy, (vide letter Novem-
ber 24,1847)  13,939,735
$09,714,519
Already asked additional for Cluarterniaster's
Depaitment  4,000.000
$*>.*,714,519
Leaving an excels of expenditures over receipts
for the yeai ending June 30, 1848   $34,114,519
Add to this the deficiency of the preceding year 23.977,949
War debt, June 30, 1848 $.">8,092,468
Besides the $9,126,439 in treasury, July 1, 1846;
and the residue is, or must be, supplied by loans.
These estimates all undeniably prove that large
amounts of money are immediately needed, and
that large loans will be required to furnish the
means indispensably necessary to the public credit.
Sir, 1 am opposed to the creation of a national
debt. If we-will incur responsibilities in a war of
conquest, we should boldly meet the emergency,
by imposing such taxes as will ensure full faith in
the plighted honor of the nation.
In the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
I find, amidst its heresies and speculations upon
free trade, one paragraph, sound and incontrovert-
ible, proposing taxation as the true basis of na-
tional faith. 1 will read it. 1 can admire " a rich
jewel" even "in an Ethiop's cax." I commend it
to the consideration of Senators, for its true and
just views of our duties:
"It is a sound rule, when contracting a public debt, to
provide, at the tune, t-nch levenue as will be adequate for
the piompt payment of the interest, and the gradual hut cer-
tain extinguishment of the principal of the debt. So long
as this rule is pursued, there is no danger of any alarming
arouniulHtion of public debt, nor any apprehension that the
public credit will be impaired or enilurra«sed. To refuse
the tax at this tune, would be to accumulate a large debt,
with an augmenting amount of interest, and with no certain
means provided for the liquidation 01 such emngements.
The cn-dit of nations is best maintained when, toi all their
obligations, adequate pi ovimou ismaile.it the tnne; and there
is danger that increasing debts, without any additional reve-
nue, aught expose our tinanccs to great liazaul."
With one short extract, sir, from the report of
General Hamilton, I will trouble the Senate. He
speaks of " incorporating as a fundamental maxim
' m the system of public credit of the United
< States, that the creation of debt should always be
' accompanied tcilh the means of extinguishment,
* which is the true secret for rendering pufr/ic credit
* immortal.*9
Sir, I commend this doctrine to the attention of
the Administration, and recommend imposing suf-
ficient taxes, rather than depend, at this emer-
gency, upon loans.
During the past fiscal year, the products of the
country have borne high and unexampled prices.
A general prosperity pervaded our whole business
and monetary concerns. The cotton crop—I agree,
sir, the ruling crop of the country—exceeding but
little 1,800,000 bales, ruled at prices high and
exorbitantly remunerating. The influence of the
new tariff and the sub-treasury had not been felt;
there were short crops of breadstuff's in continental
Europe—a famine in Ireland—and in England the
product falling far below the general average, ere*
at6d an extraordinary demand for the surplus of
the rich harvests of our country, and elevated
prices to an unexpected height. Cotton advanced
to points ranging from 10 to 14 cents; fltfur $9;
corn $1 30.
At such prices was a portion of the exports of
the country valued, and at that unusual and ex-
traordinary valuation the whole exports by custom-
house returns amount to $158,648,000, and ex-
ceeded by $26,000,000 the export of any preceding
year. This amount of export, under a home val-
uation—and that valuation based upon an excited
and inflated market—is not the true testof the value
of our exports, nor of our ability to import and
consume the product of other countries—it is alone
the net proceeds of these exports, such as are real-
ized and returned to the country, that makes the
true, ascertained, and certain value.
Now, sir, I submit, that from this statement of
exports, as rendered by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, there should be deducted—losses by sea, dam-
age to cargoes on the voyage, reduced receipts of
sales less than the cost or valuation at home, chari-
ties—the holiest and the best of all exports to suf-
fering humanity—and losses by bankruptcies, and
the actual amount realized to the country did not
exceed   .$140,000,000
Imports for fiscal year, ending June,
1847 $146,545,638
Spccie  24,000,000
In foreign goods §122,545,638
Upon this estimate, the excess of imports over
the net proceeds of exports has created a balance
against us of   §6,545,638
In addition, in consequence of the extreme mon-
etary pressure in England, stocks have been return-
ed, and sold to an amount estimated at §10,000,000
Which added to imports over exports 6,545,638
LeUves an actual balance of exchang'e §16,545,638
The import of specie was a safe one for the coun-
try, although yielding no revenue; and about 80
per cent, of it has gone, and is rapidly going, to
restore the balance of trade^and equalize exchanges.
A year since, or thereabouts, exchange on England
was four per cent.—or something like six per cent,
below par. Now it is at a premium of eleven per
cent.—all of one and a half,per cent, above par;
and the exports in specie are kept back only be-
cause foreign gold cannot be had; and the shipper
sustains a loss of one per cent, on the shipment of
American gold. The greatest distress prevails in
all the great marts of business and commercial
cities of the country. Money is worth one and a
half per cent, per month m eastern markets. The
banks are prudently contracting their loans and
curtailing their issues to reach a point of safety.
The circulating medium of the country is dimin-
ishing—sales are limited—manufactures and in-
dustrial pursuits checked, if not paralyzed—and
specie is rapidly going out to Mexico and to Eu-
rope. That specie, which is alone the measure of
all values and the basis of all exchanges, whether
foreign or domestic, must, and will be applied to
pay present and future balances of trade. And,
amidst this, sir, where is the national treasury,
and what are its means? Exhausted by the ex-
penses of the war—drained almost to exhaustion,
it is asking Congress for relief. 'I will read a short
extract from a mercantile journal:
"A few sales of sterling bills show that no material
chansrc has yet been pioducul in the pecuniary relations of
the United States and Great itain. Specie continues to
be rslnpnod m a moderate way, and for a few days past not
much has come in from any quarter. The sub-treasuiy has,
howevei, been diained into the banks, until it has but about
seven bundled and fifty thousand dollars on hand, and is
constantly paying large drafts, while tlie receipts aie small,
as almost all the duties are paid m tieasury notes. .At this
late the box,deemed and taken to be a treasury, will soon
be an s uch a condition that U will be convenient to scrape
the bottom. The bank« have some six millions of coin,
chiefly American gold, which is worth Jess than sovereigns
to «?hip for England by one per cent. The Government, in
conformity to the doctunes of thesub-treasurv, ha« kept the
mint haul at work m coming, at a damage of one per cent,
bjyond the labor of coining. The banks and merchants aie
looking with increased interest to the expenditures of the
Government. The state of the country is such, that if the
Mexican war is to keep up its large drains, prudent men
will pieserve the contractcd position which they have been
gaming for two or three months past. These facts in the
citv will be likely to reach the country in low pnees-for
produce, so compelling-a present payment of the expenses
