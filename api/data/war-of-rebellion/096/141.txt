looking out for you. Get four guns on shore, if you can; indeed, I do not know that you can get too many of them. We expect to try the fort this afternoon.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Brevet Major-General of Volunteers.

Have all your boats with small ammunition come to my headquarters.

TERRY,

General.

General TERRY:

I have no small ammunition. I suppose the telegram to be misdirected to me, instead of the officer in charge of the light guns.

General PAINE:

Will you have the kindness to give Captain O'Keefe a detail of 100 men, to work, so long as he needs them, on a battery intended to keep the Chickamauga out of our way?

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

They suppossed it already in our possession. Of course none of the troops that left here last are included.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
