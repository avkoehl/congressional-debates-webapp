lished against them. Evening and night of 21st enemy moved toward Goldsborough, where Schofield joined him, and yesterday we came here. Sherman's course cannot be hindered by the small force I have. I can do no more than annoy him. I respectfully suggest that it is no longer a question whether you leave present position; you have only to decide where to meet Sherman. I will be near him.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Sherman's whole army being intrenched in our front on morning of 20th we did not attack, but held our position to cover removal of wounded and occupy enemy. There was heavy skirmishing 20th and 21st, and several partial attacks by him handsomely repulsed. Troops of Tennessee army have fully disproved slanders that have been published against them. Evening and night of 21st enemy moved toward Goldsborough and yesterday we came here.
