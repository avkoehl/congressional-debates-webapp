Captain THOS. M. CACHRAN,

Osyka:

Inform Colonel Logan that his cavalry and yours must continue to observe and annoy the enemy, keeping as near him as possible. If compelled to fall back, to it no faster than may be necessary, and no farther.

From what point is the railroad to within 5 miles of Camp Moore?

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN L. LOGAN,

Osyka:

You must not come to Jackson, but remain near the enemy to observe and annoy him. You must not fall back only when compelled to do so, and no farther than may be necessary.
