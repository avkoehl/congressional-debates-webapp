Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Twenty-third Corps:

GENERAL: I have just received your communication informing me of the construction of your bridge. As soon as I can get my signal party up will establish communication with you in order to keep you advised of operations here. General Howard is not yet up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,June 19, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I find the Sandtown road crosses Noyes' Creek below the junction of two branches, one of which rises near Kenesaw, and the other near Marietta. I find it impossible to cross to-day on account of the breadth and depth of the stream. I will try to push a division over the first branch (the one you have crossed) so as to strike the enemy's left in your immediate vicinity, if from your knowledge of his position and strength you deem it advisable; please inform me.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Ballinger's House, June 19, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Twenty-third Corps:

GENERAL: Your note is just received. Two hours ago I threw Butterfield's division onto the ridge, which I take to be a spur of Kenesaw, and which is the one that the enemy have established their line on in front of Howard and myself. He is now moving on the flank of the enemy's position, and will, I hope, be able to brush him away from it. Of this, however, I cannot speak positively. He reports to me that the enemy's infantry and artillery are moving on the opposite side of this ridge in your direction. Detaching Butterfield rendered it impossible front, the ridge being on the left bank of both forks of Noyes' Creek.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,June 19, 1864-9.30 a. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIRST DIVISION:

Advance your division until you strike the Dallas and Marietta road.

By command of Major-General Hooker:

H. W. PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
