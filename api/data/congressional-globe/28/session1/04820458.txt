CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
was encouraged by the public voice; showiag that a reform
was called for, and could be no longer deferred. It was im-
possible to let things, femain in this condition.
Here Mr- M. proceeded to several calculations and statisti-
cal statements, with a view of showing that a radical and
material change was inevitable. In support at this view,
he read several passages from the Postmaster General's
report, made at the commencement of the present session.
It being impossible to stand still, the public voice calling
unanimously for a revision of the whole subject, for a
great reduction of postage, and for the abolition of the
franking privilege, the Post Office Committee felt it to be
its incumbent duty to report the present bill, with such pro-
visions as were considered best calculated to effect all the
reforms' demanded.
While a large reduction of the rates of postage was its-
commended, the committee had, with great anxiety, studied
out, and it was expected had attained, a plan of reduction
which would, in practice, have the effect of yielding suffi-
cient revenue for the support of the department} and at the
same time of meeting the wishes of the community. The
object was to adopt a ldw, which would be so far approved
cf by the people that they would co-operate in its sup-
port.
Mr. M. then proceeded to a minute review of the bill, sec-
tion by section, in detail; merely elaborating the language
of the bill itself. The following republication of the com-
pendium made m our report, when the subject was before
the Senate last week, will explain sufficiently the provisions
and objects of the bill. The parts in brackets are the

Mr. MLRR.1CK, in contmution of his remarks, stated that
the reduction of postage, by this bill, would be about one-
hall'âthe average of the old rates for single letters being
fourteen and a half to fifteen cents, and the average by the
proposed rates being seven and a half; but, although this
j eduction was considerable, it was the confident belief of
the Post Office Committee, that the effect would be to bring
into the mail the mailable matter now sent thioughout the
country b> pi.vate hands and private expresses. The
average number of letters sent through the mail now, w as
iromi'l to 27 millionsânot one-half, it was computed, ol the
actual coriespondence of the country; but, calculating the
increase of the correspondence which cheap rates of post-
age would induce, it was not unreasonable to expect that
the number of letters under the netv latcs of postage would
be ai least 80 millions. Mr. M. referred to the post office
letunus of Cheat p.iitam to show the vast increase of corres-
pondence m the United Kingdom, under the penny postage
system. The leduction there was tlyrteen-fourteenths or
from fourteen pence to one penny. Here the reduction pro-
posed was only one-hall' With regard to the British post
office, the very yeoi after the reduction of postage to one
penny, the whole expense of the department was paid, and
a surplus was bonded over to the national treasury of
$2,322,370; showing the splendid result of the axpenment.
Mr. M. then read from the Post Office Committee's report
the following passages and calculations, to show the basis
on which the. committee lounded its conclusions, that the
proposed reduction of postage under this bill would cause
an increase of post-office revenue:
'Tt appear?, from a reccnt report of the Postmaster Gene-
ral, communicated to the Senate January 18, 1844, (Senate
Doc. No. 50,) that the number of letters franked or received
five by postmasters, during the month of October last, was
130,714,which, averaged for twelve month',would make, du-
ring 9 year, the immense number of 1.568,928; and which, if
they paid postage at the average rate charged upon single
letters only, would yield the sum of $222,264 80. The same
report also shows that there were franked or received free,
by other officers of government, during the same month,
85,339 letters, makiug for the year 1,024,068; which would
yield, at the same average rate, (supposing them all to be
single, whereas more than half are believed to be usually
double or triple,) the sum of $145,076 30. The letters frank-
ed by membeis of Congress, during the same time, were
18 558 in the month, or 226,696 for the year, and would yield,
at the same average rate, $31,548 60. These three sums
make, together, the amount of $398,889 70. The whole
number ot chargeable letters, paid and unpaid, which pass
through the mail in a year, according to the same report, is
24,267,552; which would yield, according to the same aver,
age rate, $3,437,903 20. Hence it appears that above twelve
per cent, of what should be the gross revenue of the de-
partment from letters only is withheld by the government,
or granted away by it in the form of privilege to its officers;
thereby adding, in the same proportion, to the charge upon
the unprivileged correspondents. Or, to illustrate it more
plainly, the government, in this way, taxes every individu-
al citizen whose letter postage amounts to one thousand
dollars a year, (and there are many who pay much more,)
one hundred and twenty dollars per annum, and all others
m the same proportion, for this branch of the public ser-
vice, whether they be poor or rich, and no matter how
much they may contribute, in common with others, under
the revenue laws, to the national treasury.
"The committee think these things should not be, and in
them they perceive much cause for the recent manifesta-
tions of dissatisfaction before alluded to. They therefore
recommend the abolition of the franking privilege, except
only as regards a very few of the highest officers of the gov-
ernment, and those citizens who have filled either of the
two highest offices, to whom public policy or public grati-
tude seems to dictate its continuance. The committee
would not perhaps have recommended this exception, but
for the fact that the salaries of all thef.officers employed in
the General Post Office at Washington are paid out of the
general treasury, amounting to the sum of $16o,000 an-
nually; and to this extent, therefore, the government may
with justicc charge that department in the shape of privi-
ledged correspondence; and this sum will be sufficient to
cover, not only the amount which would be chargeable
upon the correspondence of those to whom it is above
recommended to continue the privilege, but will also cover
any fair estimate of the modified privilege it is wisely pro-
posed by the bill to continue to the members of Congress,
and to facilitate that intercourse between their representa-
tives and their constituents, which great and leading mo-
tives of public policy require to be fiee and frequent.
"We come now to consider the still more important pro-
visions of the bill, which propose an average reduction of
the existing rates of postage by about one-half This meas-
ure, though loudly called for by numerous memorialists,
(and to a small extent justified by the preceding recom-
mendation,) is too important in its consequences to be ven-
tured upon without the most careful examination of the
reasons to be urged on both sides. In the first place, it is
to be remembered that the government is brought more
constantly and immediately in contact with a large portion
of the people by the operations of the post office establish-
ment, than by the exeicise of any other of its powers or
duties. This is. indeed, the only one of its many high
functions whrc m its performance is felt and seen by the
great body oithe citizens, m their eveiy day business, feel-
ings, and interests. How desirable, then, that it should
illustrate in its action the true nature of our institutions,
and be rendered as far as practicable the beneficent dis-
penser of comfortjand convenience to all,"withoutburden or
vexation to any?
''Again: it is to be recollected that a well-regulated gov-
ernment post is one of the greatest improvements of modern
times, and perhaps, when viewed in all its bearings and ef-
fects upon the social and political condition of man, it may
be regarded as among the most valuable of purely human
institutions. Who can estimate its utility m preserving and
promoting harmony and good will between the different
parts of a great country; in keeping ever strong and bright
the chain of affection which binds together friends and kin-
dred, by whatever distances they may be separated; in dif-
fusing knowledge, in stimulating enterprise and industry,
in advancing religion and morality: and m fine in promo-
ting the ascendency and dominion of mind over matter? AÂ«
institution so full of good should not be tampered with by
empiricism, nor have its efficiency endangered by a restless
spirit of innovation. But there is scarcely less of error in
an obstinate adherence to established practice and the con-
sequent refusal to modify measures of policy according to
changing times and circumstances, than there is in the spirit
of innovation itself. Both must be guarded against.
Enough has been said to show the opinion of \ our commit-
tee to be, that the rates of postage should be leduced as
much as possible, consistently with the preservation of the.
usefulness and efficiency of the Post Office Department, and
the support of that department by contributions levied
equally upon all who are served by it, according to the
amount of service rendered. Can the reduction proposed
by the bill be made, consistently with these views' We
have seen m the outset that something must be done; that
the revenues of the department are rapidly falling off, and a
lemedy must in some way be found for this alarming evil,
or the very consequences so much dreaded by some, from
the reduction of rates proposed, will inevitably ensue,
namely*, a great curtailment cf the service, or a heavy
charge upon the national treasury for its necessary ex-
penses. It is believed that m consequence of the disfavor
with which the present rateb and other regulations of this
department are viewed, and the open violations of thf laws
before adverted to. not more than, if as much as one-half
the correspondence of the country passes through the mails,
the greater part beipg canied by private hands, or forward-
ed by means ot the recently established private expresses,
who perform the same service, at much less cost to the
writers and recipients of letters, than the national pos>t office.
It seems to the committee to be impossible to believe that
there are but about twenty-four or twenty-seven millions of
letters per year forwarded to distant friends and correspond-
ents in the United States, by a population of about 20,000,-
000 of souls; whilst, at the sam6 time, there are two hun-
dred and four millions and upwards of letters passing an-
nually through the mails of Great Britain and Ireland, with
a population of only about twenty-seven millions of bouls.
"Theie is surely nothing in the relative condition of the
