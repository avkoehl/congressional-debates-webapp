CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
there was so great a saving effected in the army,
where there was then 6 000 rank and file, what
mig it not be expected to be the case in the navy,
where ¡hepersonnel was as large, and where, in ad-
dition, there was a number of ships, with the cost
of their construction and repairs.
Mr K. next referred to the Navy Board and
the improper construction of the ships that had
been built under lh~ir direction, with the improper
mode of applung the public money disbursed by
them. [Some gentlemen here asked what was the
cost of building ships of the line m England, and
the cost in this country?] He had stated before
that 348,000 and odd dollars was the cost of build-
ing sh ps in EfEiand ratirg from 70 to 80 guns.
Our ships ot the line, it was «stimaied, com ao#ut
half a million, but he had no idea that^he r actuak
cost had ever been ascertained, for there had been
no regular returns made of them whatever. He
had been mformfd that it would be ut er'y impos-
sible for thif department, with all its force, to meet
the resolution of the honorable gentleman fiom
Tennes«ee, [Mr Johnson,] that, un e<s the reor-
ganjMUon ot the department was made, and a
greater clerical force placed at their disposal, the
information required by that resoluuon could not
be obtained Noxv, he was in favor < f that resolu-
tion, and thonght the information required by it
would be Useful But of what effect won d its
adoption be, unless the department was furnished
with a sufficient clerical fore  to enable it to an
swer it?
Mr K then went ¡mo an explanation of the de-
tails of the bill    It was proposed, he said, to re
peal the law creating the Board of Navy Commts
stoners, and to divid* the force which it was pro-
posed to give the department, into seven bureaus,
each bureau to be responsible for that branch of
the service intrusted to us care.    The number of
these bureaus had been objected to by some gen-
tlemen, but he b gged leave to remind them of the
fact, that all the persons proposed to be employed
an heads of these bureaus were alieady in the pub
lie ¡.ervice.   There was now atNorfolk, as head of
the Ordnance Department, a captain in the service,
and it was proposed to place him at  the head of
the Bureau of Ordnance     A post captain now in
snrviee, would be placed at the head of the Bureau
of Navy Yards and Docks.   The Provision Bu
reau it was propo ed to  phce under  the direc'ion
of one  of  the purser-.    The   Bireau   of Medi-
cine and   Surgery   was  to   be  umler one  of the
surgeons of  the   navy     The  Bureau   of  Con-
struction    and    Repairs    would    be   under    the
direction  of   the chief   naval   constructor     The
rest   would   be  under  the captains  now   in   the
service.    All thee officers mere mw m the employ
of the Government, at precisely the same «alanés
as were fixed by this bill.    There eiuld, there ore,
be no valí 1 objection to the number of the bureaus
The question  to  be considered by the- committee
was, whether, in the s erical force, the number of
persons to he en p'oyed was too great.    On  that
subjec*, he had onlv to say that the House had cut
down the number ilmost one-halt below that pro-
vided in the  bill  of the Senate, w Mch was even
less  than  thi>t required  by the Secretary  of the
Navy     He would, howeier, ask grntlemen who
objected to the amount < Í this cler ea1 fr rce, if they
had any information wnich would wairant tl"m in
raying that it was too  larpe     If th°y hpd not, be
¡submitted to tl em how they couln a k tnis commit-
tee to reduce u     He would ask the hi norable gen
tlemao from IIIhk is—who, he rearetted to see, was
opposed to this till—if he bad ?hj ir formation to
give < n the *uhjpet     The S ere ary of the Navy
ought to be ci m ered °s possessing  mi re  correct
informant n  on this subject thpn  any  oth^r  mdi
vidua', and his reeommen iations, inerefr re, ought
to have ther due weight   and son e reliance ought
to be placed on ¡he < pinions  of  the  oommittte of
the Sen ite     Tp   till  of that  commit'ee proposed
forty lour   person*—leoludu g   heads   of  bureaus
and  clerks, bul  the H< use bi)1 stiuek the number
down to Ihijiy die—rot b<~cau e,  m tne judgmet t
of the comrm ter, it wis wise to do so, but it  was
dene in order to ra/e  tie  vie vs ot ihe priat ecoa
omtsts of toe body     It was d i e, n t because tney
weie not perfectly satisfied that he nomter pro-
posed by the bill of the Senate was necessary to
place the department < n a proper footin?; but be-
cause they were apprehensive of losing the bill in
the House, if they did not make a considerable re-
duction.
Now, the whole increase proposed by the bill of
the Hou«e over that now employed in the depart-
ment was 18, the Senate had proposed 26 Gen-
tlemen migfu say tint this was a very great in-
crease; but he wiuld ask them if they had any in-
formation to show that it went beyond the amount
the public service required. If they had not, it
ieemed to him that they were very much at fault
for arguments to use against the measure. In or-
der to pl?ce the condition of the department m a
stronger light, Mr K. begged leave to call the at-
tesuion of the commutee to the condition of the
otWJdepartméms^ , A comparison of toese with
the Navy Department would be sufficient to show
how greatly it had been neglected. In 1820, the
expenses of Ihe Treasury Department were $218,-
600, he expenses rf the War Department (before
the reorganization) were $53,610, tee expenses of
the Nsvv Department, $35,270, and the expenses
of the Post Office Department, ¿32,360 Wei), in
1840, the expenses of the Treasury Depar ment
hJd risen to $313 150, the War Depigment, though
ihe reorganization of which had effected a vast
saving m the army, the expenses had ponp up to
from $53,000 and upwards, to $107,529, but the
expenses of the navy had increased but two toou-
=and and odd dollars, notwhhsianjmg the increase
of the navy
To save trouble, Mr K said he would throw
this statement into another form:

Mr K hete continued his calculations, draw-
ing a parallel between the expendituies of the
navy and ihe other departments of the Gov-
ernment, for tbepurfose of showing how much the
Nivy Depar ment had been nfglec ed. It ^eem^d
to have been suppled, b cau e the Board of
Navy Oommi sioners was esiabl sed, with a forte
of «ome half dt7cn ele ks, that they cculJ car-y
on that great department of ihe Government, wi fl-
out any oih<r-mcreasrd force r hatever, whie all
.he other departments were allowrd an mereas" of
their clencal force, year after yeai. Now, it ap-
peared to huí that, if gentlemen would take into
consider'1 Hon the simple circumstance f-at we had
to construct ships, and krep mem in repair , and
consider, also, the number of seamen empl ved,
they must come to he conclusion that the Navy
Depirtmrn' woald frqmre as large a clencal force
as the W^r Dep r'ment
Great complaints ha'' been made abou* the waste-
ful expenditures of public monet in the navy, but
why should these complaints be made' They had
creaied a Navy Board, and, with some seven < r
eight clerks, had impo«ed on them all the labor and
resnon«ibility of carrying on this grea' department.

increase the expenses, as proposed b' the amend-
ments of the Hi-use, to $ 16,064, nimmally, but
the Secretary of the Navy was authorized, by one
section of the bill, to employ officers of the navy
as clerks, so that the actual increased expense
would be little or nothing It might, however, be
said that the navy officers would not consent to be
employed as clerks He could on'y stty, m reply
to this, that army officers were crop oyed as cleiks
and heads of bureaus and he had known «everal
midshipmen who desired to be fo employed The
law was not imperative—it was permi'sive merely
—and au'honzed the Secretary to employ the ju-
nior officers in this way, if he thought proper !f
h,e should employ officers as clerks, the increased
expense would be very trifling—perhaps nothing
at all
A very great wa te, it was suppo ed, had occur-
red in our navy-yard , from the want of pro) er ac-
c unts being taken of the materials collected, and
the manner of preserving them The Bureau of
Construction and Repairs wculd take charge of tins
branch of the ""ervice, and at the head ot it it was
proposed to place the chief naval arcrn'eci It «as
to be hoped that some attention would be paid to
this subjeci, and thit the best talr-nts in the country
would be called to this branch ot the service.
Hitherto our ships had been constructed in pursu-
ance cf ihe mstruciiors of ihe Boprd <f Navy
Commissioners, and some of the wor t model  that
ever floated wete the result of the inteiferetice of
thc-e «ho had no knowledge of naval architec-
ture
When this Bureau of C instruction went into op-
eration, he hoped that measures would be taken to
call into the service the best taler s in ihe conntiy,
If the Secretary of the Navy shr uld advertise for
mode's, and give premiums for the be t that «hould
be offered to him, and then let them be d cided up-
on by scientific men, he had no doubt but we
should have the best constructed ships in the world.
We could build them cneaper, too, than any other
nation; for though labor was dear, yet we ha 1 ma-
terials much cheaper, and in greater abundance.
The ordnance department of the navy was in a
deplorable condition, and the fact had been stated
to him, (though he did not vouch fr r its correctness,)
that neither the Secretary of the Navy nor the
Navy ComTtis^ionfrs could now tell wh«t were
the armaments of the ships of warm se>vice. A
large number of what were called medium guns
had been cast, that were utterly worthless, and to
shoiv still further the want of science that pervades
the ordnance department of the navy, he would
state the fact, tbat, as U nz ago as last August, a
42 pounder was bored out, to try if it would an-
swer as a 64 pound gun Well, instead of trying
the expenrri' t on shore, by a train leading to the
?un,sothatno rne's life would be endangered the
gun was placed on board of one of the S'eamsb ps,
and fired ! ff in the usual way. Trie result was,
that the gun burst, kil mg «everal men, and, upon
examination, it was found to be three inches thicker
on one side than the other Such was the deplora-
b e wan., of scterce in hat brpnch of ihe naval ser-
vice Mr K then proceeded to show the want of
organ zation in the medical department, and the
waste that was the consequerce of it, but was cut
off by tne expiration ( f h s hour
The time hnvied fir deoatt having exp red—
Mr WISE lose to propose amendments from
the C( mr-i'ttee on Naval Afiirs It tie ecord
section, which proposed the appointment i f seven
bureaus, he propo ed an amendment, to reduce ihe
