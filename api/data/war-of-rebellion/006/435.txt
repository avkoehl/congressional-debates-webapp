Brigadier General MAXCY GREGG,Commanding Fourth Military District S. C.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to inform you that your military district is extended as far west as the Coosawhatchie River, including the station at Coosawhatchie, from and below Coosawhatchie Station, bounded by the east bank of the Coosawhatchie River.

The major-general commanding would suggest that you send a company of cavalry under your command to take the place of the company of Tennessee volunteers about to be removed, and also that, as soon as the guns on the Ashepoo River are removed, the company of German artillery now at Chapman's fort be divided into three detachments, one to serve the guns at Combahee Ferry, the second to serve the carronades at Stony Creek work, and the third to man the heavy guns at Bee Creek battery, each detachment to be under the command of a commissioned officer; the captain to be stationed at such point as you in your judgment may designate.

Very respectfully, &c.,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., April 11, 1862.

Governor PICKENS,

Columbia, S. C.:
