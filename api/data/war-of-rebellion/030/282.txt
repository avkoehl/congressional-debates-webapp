possible by the Cumberland; that a gunboat convoy will be obtained, if possible; though, so far, we have not been able to communicate with Cairo, where the gunboats are understood to be.

Give him any other information you may think important, and have the telegraph line repaired as rapidly as possible, so as to be in ready communication with him.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Can find only one boat here that can go up the Cumberland, the rest being too deep draught. Will load her and send her down, to stop at Louisville. Take any light-draught boats you can find, and load them with subsistence and forage for Rosecrans. Have not succeeded in getting convoy, as I can't communicate with Cairo. Will send down on the boat six 3,6-inch rifle guns and one 12-pounder, to be distributed on different boats. Gunners and sharpshooters must be taken from your command. This will go, I think. Two light-draught gunboats have been sent from here to Louisville,but they are not armed or manned. See if Captain Foster, commanding Chillicothe, can authorize their going up the Cumberland as convoy, if you arm and man them. Intercepted letters from Morgan's headquarters say he will leave the State by way of Dansville. Notify Hoskins and any commanders you can reach.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

I have information, on which I an inclined to rely, that in case the President issues his proclamation of emancipation on the 1st proximo, the Legislature of Kentucky, which meets on Monday next, will legislate the State out of the Union, and that the Governor's message will favor such action; also that the court of appeals has a disloyal majority, and will reverse all judgments of loyal inferior courts against rebels. I propose, first, to so dispose the force I have as to have several Northern regiments in the vicinity of Frankfort; second, to arrest all members of the Legislature voting for ordinance of secession,and all State officers favoring it; or, third, to arrest any members of the Legislature who, by their speeches or other acts, recommend the secession of the State; I prefer the second proposition; fourth, to arrest the reputed disloyal members of court of appeals on first indication of disloyalty, or, if thought best, on arrest of the Legislature.

I desire approval or disapproval of each of foregoing propositions. Please answer by telegraph.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
