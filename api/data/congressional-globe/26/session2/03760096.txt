Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Rhett.
H. of Reps.
year it was thirteen millions, this year, ten. It
consists of liabilities on the Treasury on account
of past appropriations, to complete which the mo-
usy has not been called for, and when the mo-
ney is called for during any one year, there will
usually be as much money undrawn from the
Treasury remaining on hand from the new ap-
propriations Thus the money taken on account
of the old appropriations will be balanced by the
money remaining in the Treasury from the new
appropriations The whole of an appropriation
can seldom or never be expended lmmediatel),
because the application of labor is necessarily
gradual and limited Public works are not com-
pleted m a day, and whatever amount is drawn
for such purposes by virtue of old appropriations, is
counterbalanced on the Treasury books by the new,
for which money is not required The account
thus runs on from yearto year, the outstanding ap-
propriations at any one time being pretty much the
same It is there'bre an affair of paper,
not of debt, for which money must be sup-
plied I  it not astonishing, sir, that men o'd in
legislation on this floor should alarm themselves,
and endeavor to alarm the country, by such egre-
gious mistaken And yet, this single item consti
tutes the mam ground for the declamation we have
heard about a bankiupt Treasury and profligate
Administration, whilst an extra session of Congre s
is gravely urged, to stop up the enormous gap it
has made in the Treasury
The last charge is on account oí the Post Ornee,
made by my colleague, [Mr Thompson,] of
f 1,500,000 I turn to the Postmata General -> re
port, and I find that he puts the indebtedness of his
i Department at but $219 84r> Nor will eventing
small amount be any charge upon the yeai 1341,
for which extraordinary means, by taxation or per-
manent loans, need be provided The Postmaster
General -.ays, m his report "But the present appa-
rently uniavoiable financial condition of the De-
partment need occasion no anxiety It can be sus-
tained upon its own resource, and soon placed in
a safe and prosperous condition " * * *
"With a reasonable expectation of a reduction in
the expenses of the transportation, and nearly a
certainty of a considerable increase in its revenues,
the future prospects of the Department are highly
satisfactory "
It should be borne in mtnd that the contracts for
transportirg the mail are made lor four year , conse-
quently a lar«.e pcrtnn of the contracts tulfilled
within the last two years were mide when pr.ces
were \ery hyb, and have laerefoie be n^xtiavi-
gant for ihe times Thi-. department has been in
debted repcalelly beyond this ,imo int, but it has
been left to it elt, and h-u ilwijs woilnd out is
own extr catu n, <nd doubtless now need no assisl-
ancefiom pny resources but is own This item
therefore may be wiped out

Thu , sir, th" Government will be enabled, not
only to íedeem the #4,500,000 of Treasury notes
now outstanding, but also the $5 000,000 of
Treasury notes authorized to be isiued by ihe bill
under consideration, (should it be found expedi-
ent to issue them,) and have, at the end of the
year, a million and a halt of dollars in the Ttea-
sury In my e-timate of our revenue from the
customs, I have put it at what the gentleman-from
Mame concived to be reasonable, and I believe
eveiy representativo from our great commercial
emporiums will approve The other items oí our
resources have been undispu ed, and I believe to
be indisputable Where now is yoni necessity f r
a ten million loan, or increased taxatu n? Ne thcr
expedient can be necessary, according to the scale
oí expenditure we propose to give, nor, if they
are increased several millions, will the Go-
vernment be embarrassed But will our scale
of expenditure kati<-(y you? Certainly not The
gentleman fiom Maine, and the gentleman from
New York, haie b to. proved this present Ad
ministration to be one of the meanest and most
parsimonious that has ever afflicted the coun-
try, although never, since the first days of the
confederacy, have our foreign relations, con-
stituting as they d > the chi^f object of its crea-
tion, been conducted with moie skill and dig-
nity, nor our national character stood higher
abroad, than within the last ioui years But
yesterday, it rioted in extravagance, and want-
toned in its profligate expenditures of the peo
pit's monev But now, it has neglected its
duty to th" country, in the unpti ¡cip'ed at-
tempt to spend oil) what is ausolukly nee sa y,
in tead of iiming at that po mon of dignity and
efficiency which a largi r indmore liberal expen I
lure wou'd «ccuie The times, sir, have change]
Anew Administraren is about to run its course
In th" accuvatun of parsimony and meanness now,
no more than in the imputation of extravagance
formerly, was justice regarded towards the piesent
Adimnistiation But the purpose now i* to prepare

Seeing the repeated and resolute efforts, on th 
rait oí gentlemen, in spi'e of iac <, to make out,
by figures, th* neces lty of aJditio al means for
the use of Go\erairent, I was at a loss to under
stand the purpose Ii an exu a session of Congress
was wanted, to keep up the chase whilst the blood
was warm, there was the Indepen lent Treasury bill
to be repealed, and the establishment of a Um ed
States Bank, to justify the measure, at lean to tho e
who had placed them in power But the mystery
was solved, yesterday, in the Senate, by the frank
declarations of a distinguished Sena'or, about to
occupy, if rumor be true, the highest seat in the
counjiils of the ensuing Administration He de-
clared that his purpose was to abstract from the
Treasury the four millions annually accruing from
the public l?nds by giving them to the States, and
to supply the vacuum by taxation through the cus-
toms— crnefly on silks The charge of indebted-
ness m the Government is thus virtually g ven up,
and the proposed scheme of taxation on silk, and
other productions of France, is distinctly united
with the project of distribution. I understand this
it is sensible and manly, although, I think, unwar-
ranted by tbe Constitution, and will be fatal, by its
corrupting influences, to our whole frame of Go-
vernment
Mr Cnairman, I am not opposed to a tax on lux-
uries On ths contrity, I shall be prepared, when
the time arrives, if any discrimination is admitted
in our duties, to go as far as any one in the policy
of reli vmg the necessities of life from taxation,
and raising all the revenue we may require by
imposts on luxuries Bui I am not prepared to
tax eny thing to replace money which may be ta-
ken from the Treasury to be given to ths States,
A giving Government is essentially a tyranny. Free
Governments are fiduciary, not absolute, in their
character, and have no right to expend money but
for the purposes they were organized to fulfil
Largesses to the people have ever proved to be the
price of their liberties, or the instrument by which
they have been overthrown Under no circum-
stances, therefore, will I aid a policy which all his-
tory proves to be so fatal to liberty But if I were
prepared to adopt it, I 'hould not supply the va-
cuum in ths Treasury it would occasion by a tax
on jxertieultr luxuries, imported chiefly by the pro-
ductions of the South, and leave those free of duty
which are imported by the productions of other
portions of the Union. Tax all luxuries or tax
none The trade between France and this country,
which it is proposed to burden, is carried on almost
exclusively by the cotton, rice, and tobacco of the
South I hold in my hand a table carefully com-
piled, showing the exports and imports between
France and the United States, from the year 1835 to
1819, inclusive.

Thus the whole direct export trade is carried on
almi st entirely by our staples, and, undoubtedly,
they contribute a so largely to the indirect trade by
which the importations 110m France are effected,
csnsistin  of <m average of from three to ten mil-
lions of dollars.

Of worsted and worsted s'uff g oils, we also im-
ported a milluii and a half average, of linen,
abiuthalfa million, and of specie, about a mil-
lion. Whil't of manufactured cotton goods,
we imported scared .rone million a year. Thus
showing that this lucrative tr de,wr list it is beneficial
to the South, doe  not come into competition with
the cotton manufactures of the North. Its bear
ing on the nav gation interests—that great inte-
rest, which, unless crippled or crushed by our un-
wise legis'a ¡m, is destined to be the bulwark of
our national independence—is also most remarka-
ble Nearly the whole trade is carried on by our
own shipping, as will be seen by the following
table.
