H. J. JEWETT,

President, Zanesville, Ohio:

No. 26 has not arrived. What is the cause of the delay? Is there any trouble anywhere now? your dispatch as to delay last night is received. I would be very glad to oblige the Steubenville and Indiana and to comply with your wishes, but with the little actual knowledge I possess at this distance, would not think it judicious for me to interfere and give express preference over other roads possessing perhaps equal advantages. In this I am confident your judgment would concur. Please keep me fully advised as to the progress of all trains, whether the news be good or bad. It is very important I know all the facts and when to expect trains. Please answer immediately.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

Captain J. B. FORD, and also

AGENT BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD AT

BELLAIRE AND BENWOOD:

I hope you are sending out no trains without stoves during this cold weather. See General Couch before doing so. You can get stoves from trains from the west if you have not enough.

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

I just arrived. All trains but one have passed over the river. I think every car you can send will be very promptly taken over. Ask Lough if all have left Cincinnati.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Do you not think it imprudent to allow cars to go east without stoves in them? How are the cars arriving? In what condition, and what is their contents? I remain here for a day or two. Please keep me advised of progress.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
