is still collecting troops at Canton and Jackson. Some are coming over the railroad, and all the country is joining his standard. The destruction of the enemy's artillery and ordnance stores was so complete that all these must be brought in from a distance. I sent a large force up between the Yazoo and Big Black Rivers. Forage, beef, and bacon were found in great abundance. The forage and bacon were destroyed by our troops and the stock brought to camp. I am now placing all my spare force on the narrowest part of land between the two rivers, about 45 miles northeast, with the cavalry watching all the crossing of Big Black River. We shell the town a little every day, and keep the enemy constantly on the alert. We but seldom lose a man now. The best of health and spirits prevail among the troops.

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., June 8, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Vicksburg is closely invested. I have a spare force of about 30,000 men with which to repel anything from the rear. This includes all I have ordered from WEST Tennessee. Johnston is concentrating a force at Canton, and now has a portion of it WEST of Big Black River. My troops have been north as far as Satartia, and on the ridge back of that point there is no force yet. I will make a waste of all the country I can between the two rivers. I am fortifying Haynes' Bluff, and will defend the line from here to that point at all hazards.

Major-General.
