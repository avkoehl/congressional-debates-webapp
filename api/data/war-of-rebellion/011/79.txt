WASHINGTON, March 30, 1862.

Major General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

This Department has just received information that Nashville "has almost been left defenseless by General Buell." Governor Johnson and General Dumont, in command, are of opinion that the force is inadequate to the security of that city, and that there should be one complete brigade in addition to the force now there. It is said that regiments are left in detached positions without a single piece of artillery, and that there are two regiments at Camp Chase and one at Lexington that might be ordered to Nashville. You can appreciate the consequence of any disaster at Nashville, and are requested to take immediate measures to secure it against all danger.

Secretary of War.

Via Nashville-1 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

Your dispatches of the 29th received. Please refer to my letter of the 23rd and inform me what part of the arrangements explained in it I shall alter or what force you will spare in front of Nashville. My present arrangement is to strike the Tennessee with four divisions certainly, and, if necessary, take also the division from this route, making five divisions. I have not apprehended an advance upon Nashville in great force, but a dash with 15,000 men I think it proper to guard against.
