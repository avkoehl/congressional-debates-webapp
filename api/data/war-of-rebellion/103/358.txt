At Elyton on the evening of the 30th I directed General McCook to detach Croxton's brigade, with orders to move on Tuscaloosa as rapidly as possible, burn the public stores, military school, bridges, foundries, and factories at that place; return toward the main column by the way of the Centerville road and rejoin it at, or in the vicinity of, Selma. Besides covering our trains and inflicting a heavy blow upon the enemy, I hoped by this detachment to develop any movement on his part intended to intercept my main column. General Upton's division encountered a few rebel cavalry at Elyton, but pushed them rapidly across the Cahawba River to Montevallo. The rebels having felled trees into the ford and otherwise obstructed it, the railroad bridge near Hillsborough was floored over by General Winslow. General Upton crossed his division and pushed on rapidly to Montevallo, where he arrived late on the evening of the 30th. Long and McCook marched by the same route. In this region General Upton's division destroyed the Red Mountain, Central, Bibb, and Columbiana Iron Works, Cahawba Rolling Mills, five collieries, and much valuable property. All of these esbalishments were of great extent and in full operation. I arrived at Montevallo at 1 p.m. March 31, where I found Upton's division ready to resume the march. Directly after the enemy made his appearance on the Selma road. By my direction General Upton moved his division out at once, General Alexander's brigade in advance. After a sharp fight and a handsome charge General Alexander drove the rebel cavalry, a part of Crossland's (Kentucky) brigade and Roddey's division, rapidly and in great confusion, toward Randolph.
