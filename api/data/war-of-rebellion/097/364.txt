MARCH 31, 1865-5.50 p.m.

General WEBB:

I have just seen an officer and a sergeant from General Sheridan, who were cut off in an attack by the enemy and escaped. From what they say our cavalry was attacked about noon by cavalry and infantry and rapidly driven back, two divisions (Crock's and Devin's) being engaged. The firing seem to recede from me toward Dinwiddie. I have sent General Bartlett and my escort in that direction, but I think they cannot be in time. I hear cannonading that I think is from near Dinwiddie Court-House.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

A staff officer of General Merritt's has made a report that the enemy has penetrated between Sheridan's main command and your position. This is a portion of Pickett's division. Let the force ordered to move out the White Oak road move down the Boydton plank road as promptly as possible.

A. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MARCH 31, 1865-6.30 p.m.

General WEBB:

I have ordered General Pearson, with three regiments that are now on the plank road, right down toward Dinwiddie Court-House. I will let Bartlett work and report result, as it is too late to stop him. We can see the enemy's breast-works for two miles east along the White Oak road. If they are well manned they cannot be carried. I am within 200 yards of where they turn off north from the White Oak road.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-7.30 p.m. (Received 8 p.m.)

Major-General WARREN:

Dispatches from General Sheridan say he was forced back to Dinwiddie Court-House by a strong force of cavalry, supported by infantry. This leaves your rear and that of the Second Corps on the Boydton plank open and will require great vigilance on your part. If you have sent the brigade down the Boydton plank it should not go farther than Gravelly Run, as I don't think it will render any service but to protect your rear.*

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
