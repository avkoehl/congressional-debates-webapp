Brigadier-General PATRICK,Provost-Marshal-General:

I think it very imprudent returning the rebel prisoners through my lines, and believe their reported mission a fraud to get information of the strength of our position. Please answer at once.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 7, 1864-8.45 a.m. (Received 8.46 a.m.)

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

Have you any troops at Allen's Mill?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 7, 1864-9 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have no troops at Allen's Mill; I understand that General Warren has a regiment there in position. Major Duane has a sketch of the position occupied by our troops. General Willcox has finished the parallel in front of his line, and has succeeded in driving back the enemy's skirmishers. General Potter drove the enemy from a commanding hill on his right and front, and I propose to extend his line and intrench the hill for a battery, in case we succeed in holding it. It is one of the hills given up on the day General Warren withdrew. Major Morton is now reconnoitering with a view to throwing forward General Crittenden's division.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
