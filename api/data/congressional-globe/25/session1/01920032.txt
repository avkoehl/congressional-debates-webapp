rolicy that created the surplus He said it had
ever been the ol-jeot of the opposes of the adminis-
tration (he meant the federal party, for he liked to
call th'igs by their right names) to ennch the Fede-
ral Government, and thereby dimmish the reseivecl
soveieignty and independence oí the States, aid
consequently the liberty of the people They wete
the sa e paity, and governed b) the same princi-
pie, which «anted, at the inception of the Union,
' a timtled monarchy, and a Senate for life,'" and
after failing in that, had striven from that
time to this tor a Government as nearly monar-
chical as possible, a rich and powerful, great
and consolidated Fedeial Government will suf-

the moment they admitted a dollar could be raised

Where, then, would be their personal liberty, their
State sovereignty1 What would have been gamed
by their independence1 Gone, sir' gme foi ever—
swallowed up and meiged m the great vortex oi

our gallant rncestors shook oft the fetters and
shackles that bound them to the British thione, the
aggregate amount of freedom and independence

rendeied a potion of its soveieignty, or ipther
yielded ceitam oj its State u?hls, to the Federal
Government but there vías no increase or dimi-
nution of powei , it was no more than a ttansferof
the right to exeicise power It took of the powei
which the State  had derived from the people, and
gave to the Federal Government, and what was
not trans'ened was reserved
Mr D slid, "money is powei," that as an indivi-
dual, a State, or a nvtion becams rich, it become
pov erfnl th l is i Govtrnmrit betin  iich,
(wh n ilua« mide so by n>e ) so in piepoition
did the peopV 1 ei me poor, that ¡  proportion as
the r deialGovti .ment became powerful in this
rcsptct, so did the Stat" Governments become male
and derenelent, be aitse thi amrmitif powei thus

He thousht it \ery important that the State and
General Governments should e?ch be confined to

were peimitied to pass their bounds, there could Le

either case are oveileaped, w tnt assurance have
the people that their liberties and reserved rights
¡nay not be imperceptibly frittered away and swal-
lowed up by the Governments ercitV originally
for their protection, and they s«rrpped i aked as a
Danish boor or a Ru-sian sen", especially if the
United States mav ta\ them, and the States may
tax them, when neither ta\ is to be levied for
eitner National or State puiposes It w as by gradual
usurpations that any Government became tyianm-
cal. No people ever gave up at once moie oi
natural and inherent rights than was necessaiy to
protect the residue Mr B repeated he should
vote for the bill, because he was opposed to the po-
licy out of which the surplus grew
I go foi it, because the purposes foi which the
deposite act was passed have been accomplished,
vu the disposal of an accumulated fund I go
foi it, because the Government wants the use of
the money, and must have it, and has no right to
supply its place, if not used, by a tax or loan He
acted in this matter without any instructions from
his constat enb, all that guieted him was his own
judgment, and a knowledge of the fact that he had
the honoi to represent a high nun letl and honorable
people, who stood read), at all tinus, to mimtam
their Government—-a people who did not carry
their patriotism m their pockets, whose love of
l.berty did not consist in the enjoyment of a few
dollars and cents, but in love of country, m an at-
tachment to hei institutions, and in a disposition to
sacrifice every selfish and personal consideration to
the shrine of correct principles—a people who do
not live for themselves, but foi their friends, their
country, and posterity
censure Nothing can be more delicate than the
cunency Nothing can require to be more deli-
cately handled It ought nevei to be tampeied
with, nor touched, until it becomes absolutely ne-
cessarv But if untried experiments justly deserve
censure, what condemnation would aiepetition of
an expenment that has failed deserve1 An experi-
ment that has so signally failed, both in the opinion
of supporters and opponents, as to call down the
bitter denunciitiou of those who tried it If to
make the experiment was folly, the repetition
would be madness But if the opposition cannot
support the measure, how can it be expected to
receive support from the friends of the admmi&tia-
tion, in whose hands the experiment has so signally
failed, as to call down from them execrations deep
and loud1
It, Mr President, there be any one pojit fully
established by experience and reason, I hold it to be
the utter incompetency oí the Slate banks to fur-
nish, of themselves, a sound and stable currencv
The) may succeed m prosperous times, but the
first adveise current necessarily thiows them into
utter confusion IN or has any device been found
to give them the the requisite strength and stability,
but a great central and controlling bank, instituted
under the authority of tl is Government I go fui-
thei If we must continue oui connexion with the
banks—if we must receive and pay away their
notes as money, we not only have the right to regu-
late ind give uniformity and stability to them, but
we are bound to do so, and to use the most efficient
means for that purpose The constitution makes
it our duty to lay and collect 'he taxe  and duties
uniformty throughout the Union, to fulfil which
we are bound to giv e the hignest possible equality
of value thioughont evervpart ot the country, to
whatever medium it may be collected in, and if
that be bank notes to adopt the most effective means
of accomplishing it, «huh experience has shown
to bt a rnnk ot the I rated States 11ns has been
long my opinion I tnlcruiineu >t m 1816, anel
repexted n in my place here on the deposite ques-
tion m 1831 Tha onty alternative then is, disguise
it as yon mav, between a disconnexion and a bank
of the United States. This is the real issue to
which all must come, and ought nosv to be openly
and fairly met
But there aie difficulties, m the waj of a national
bank, no le«s foimidable than a reconnexion with
the State banks It is utterly impracticable, at pre-
sent, to establish one There is reason to believe
that a majonty of the people of the United States are
deliberately and unalterably opposed to it At ell
eve nts, thci t is anumerous, respectable, and pow e t-
ful pan) (I lefei to tne old State rights party) who
are, and even have been, from the beginning of the
Goveinmen , opposed to the bank, ana whose opin-
ions, thus Ion<" andfiimly entertained,ought at least
to bt so mué h lespecteei as to forbid the creation of
one, w lthout an amendment of the constitution To
this must be added the insuperable difficulty, that
the Executive bianch of the Government is openly
opposed to it, and pledged to interpose his veto, on
constitutional giounds, should a bill pass to mcor-
poiate one For four yeais,at least, then, it will be
impracticable to chai ler a bank What must be
done in the mean time 1 Shall the Treasury be i e-
oigam/ed topeifoimthc functions whichhave been
íecentlv dischaigedby the banks, or shall the State
institutions be again employed until a bank can I e
created * In the one case, we shall have thesomuel
v illified and denounced sub treasury as it is called,
and m the othei, difficulties insurmountable would
glow up against the establishment of a bank Let
the State institutions be once reinstated, and re-
urited to ihe Government as their fiscal agents, and
they will be found the first and most strenuous op-
poneris of a national bank, by winch they would be
overshadow ed and curtailed m theirprohts I hold
it certain that in prosperous times, when the State
banks are in full operation, it is impossible to es-
tablish a national bank Its creation, then, should
the reurion with the State banks take place, -will
be posponed until some disaster, similar to the
present, shall again befall the country But it re-
quires little ot the spirit of prophecv to see that
such another disastei would be the death of the
whole system Alrtadv it has had two paralytic
stroke—the third would piove fatal
But suppose t! ese difficulties were overcome, I
would still tie opposed to the incorporation of a bank
So far from affording the relief which many anti-
cipate, it would be the most disastrous measure that
could be adopted   As great as is the calamity un

Mi Ppisidim An cxlii iidinan cour of
events, with vvhich ail ai t too Imulidi to need le
cital, has sepaialeel, in fact, the Government and
the banks Whit rehtion shall they beat here
aftci i Shall the b inks a. tin he used as fiscal
agents eif the Govern nent' Be the depositories of
the public monej ¡ And, above all, sinll their
notes be considered and treated as money, m the
receipts and expenditures of the Government1
This ¡s the gieat and leading question, one of the
fust magnitude, and full of consequences I have
given it my most an \ious and delibeiate attention,
i"d have come to the conclusion thai we have
reached the pen id mien the interest boih of the
Government ind tl e ban >s fotoiel a leumon 11 ow
propose to offci mj leasons foi this concHnon I
slMl elo it with that perfect frankness due to the
subject, to the counti) and the position I occupy
All I ask is, ihat ] may be heaiet with a canden ami
lanness coiiespondmg to the smccnty with vuneh
I shall elehver m) sentiments
Those who support aieumon of the bank  aril
the Government, have to overcom  a pielimmai}
difficulty They are now sepaiated, by operation
of law, and cannot be united while the present state
e>f th ngs contii ue, w ithout repealing the law which
has disjoined them I xsk,w hois willing to propose
its icpeal1 Is theie anj one who during the sus
pension of specie pa) merits, would advocate their
cmplovment a the fiscal agents of the Govern
ment, who would make them the depositones of
ehe public revenue, ot who would lecene md pa)
avvav then notes m the jnbhc dues' If theie be
nine, then it results thai the sepaiation must con-
tinue foi the piescnt, and that the reunion must be
the work of lime, and dependirg on the coniin
gency of the resumption of specie payments
But suppose this diffie iity to be removed, and
that the banks were regula 1) redeeming their notes
fiovn what pany in this body can the proposition
come, or by w Inch c in it be supported, foi i reunion
between them and the Government1 Who, after
what has happened, can advocate the leumon of
the Government with the league of State banks'!
Can the opposition who for vears have been de
inuneing it as the most dangerous instrument of
powei, and efficient means of corrupting and con-
ti oiling the Government and countn ' Can thev
after the exact fulfilment of all then predictions of
disastrous consequences from the connexion, now
turn round and support that wnich they have -o

much from the opposite side of untued experiments
