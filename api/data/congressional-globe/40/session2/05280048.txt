APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[November 18,
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
Report of ihe Secretary of the Interior.
40th Goto.. ..2d Sess.
recommended that they be warmed in the same
manner as the other passages.
Ii' the Capitol grounds be extended to C
streets north and south, as recommended by
the architect, the Capitol would occupy about
the centre of the enlarged area. It is univer-
sally conceded that the present limits are en-
tirely too contracted. Justice to the adjoining
proprietors requires that it should at an early
day be determined to whatextent their.property
contiguous to those limits will be needed for
public uses. Squares numbered 575, 576, 687,
and tJ88 were appraised in 1860, by authority
ot Congress, as a preliminary step to their
purchase. All permanent improvement of the
property was suspended. The Senate subse-
quently passed a bill providing for the purchase
of the squares, but limiting the price thereof
to the_ appraisal of 1860. The value of real
estate in that portion of the city has since then
greatly enhanced. In view of these facts the
holders of this property have presented a me-
morial to this Department urging that three
disinterested appraisers be selected—one by
the Government, one by the property owners,
and the third by these two; that Congress shall
at once decide what, grounds shall be purchased
and direct their value to be fixed by the ap-
praisers. The propriety of early legislative
action is suggested.
The work upon the north portico of the De-
partment of the Interior is nearly finished.
An estimate has been submitted of the amount
necessary for completing it and paving the
street.
The following statement shows the amounts
advanced to marshals of the United States for
the year ending June 30, 1867, for defraying
the expenses of the courts of the United States,
including fees of marshals, jurors, and wit-
nesses, maintenance of prisoners, and contin-
gencies of holding the courts:

Ihe amount paid to district attorneys, their
assistants and substitutes, for the same period
was $140,945 29; to United States commis-
sioners, $50,043 0;>; to clerks of the courts of
the bnited States 70,895 25; and for miscella-
lieom expenditures $157,837 67. Of this sum
^(50,092 07 were paid fur rent of buildings for
the accommodation ot the courts and their
officers.
By an act of Congress approved May 12,
lSfJ4, the Secretary oi the Interior was author-
ized to designate some suitable prison or peni-
tentiary^ and to contract with the authorities
thereof ibr the confinement of persons convicted
of crime, the punishment whereof is impris-
onment, and sentenced by the courts of the
United^ States in a district or territory where,
at the time ot such conviction, there should be
no suitable prison or penitentiary. Under the
authority so conferred my predecessor made
contracts with the House of Conduction at
Detroit, and the Iowa State penitentiary, for
the subsistence and employment of all convicts
sentenced by the courts of the United States
for the several Territories to imprisonment at
hard labor, ihe former institution receives
under the contract only such whose term of
sentence was two or more years. .Prisoners
have been sent to these prisons from the Terri-
tories ot Colorado, Nebraska, and Montana.
iheact further provides thati'f in the opinion
of the Secretaiy of the Interior the expense of
transportation will exceed that of maintaining
the convicts in jail in the Territory during the
period of their sentence, it shall be lawful so
to confine them. None have been sent fro in
any of the other Territories, as, in the opinion
of my predecessors, in which 1 concur, the
expense of their_ transportation would flu-
exceed the cost of maintaining them in jails in
the Territories.
An aet entitled "An act setting aside certain
proceeds from internal revenue for the erec-
tion of penitentiaries in the Territories of Ne-
braska, Washington, Colorado, Idaho, Mon-
tana, Arizona, and Dakota," approved .January
22, 18(17, appropriated the net proceeds of the
internal revenue of said Territories for the'
fiscal year ending the :30th of June, 1800, and
the two succeeding years, ibr the purpose of
erecting, under the direction of the Secretary
ot the Interior, penitentiary buildings in said
territories, at such place therein as had been
or might be designated by the Legislatures
thereof and approved by him. The amount
to be expended therefor was not to exceed
$20,000 in Washington Territory, nor $40,000
iu either of the other Territories. The atten-
tion of the Governors of these Territories was
invited to the subject, and they were requested,
when the territorial Legislatures had passed an
act designating the place for the erection of
such penitentiaries, to transmit a duly certified
copy thereof to this Department-. Advices have
been received only from Washington and Mon-
tana.
The ninth section of an act to enable the
people of Nebraska to form a constitution and
State government, and for the admission of
said State into the Union on an equal footing
with the original States, approved April lot
1864, (Statutes-at-Large, volume thirteen, page
47, J provides that fifty entire sections of land,
to be selected and located by the direction of
the Legislature thereof on or before the 1st day
of January, 1888, should be, and they wore
thereby, granted to the Slate of Nebraska on
her admission into the Union, in accordance
with certain provisions of that act, for the pur-
pose ol erecting a suitable building for a peni-
tentiary or State prison, in such manner as "the
Legislature shall prescribe. The State was not
admitted under that act. An act entitled "An
act for the admission of the St.ote of Nebraska "
passed February 0, 18(57, declares the State if
Nebraska to be entitled to the rights, privile es
grants, and immunities, and subject to alllhe
conditions and restrictions of said aet of April
19. 1864. The proclamation of the President
contemplated in the third section of the aet of
1807 was issued March 1, 1807. Nebraska, on
her admission to the Union, was entitled to the
grant, of luads for the specific purpose of erect-
ing a State prison. Her admission occurring
after the passage of the act of January 22.
1867. changed entirely her preexisting relations
with the United States. That aet regarded
her only as a Territory, and did not authorize
the building of a penitentiary within the limits
of a State.
I have been informed by the Secretary of the
Treasury that the entire amount appropriated
for building these penitentiaries in Washington,
Colorado, Montana, and probably Idaho, has
been received and is available for that purpose.
In Arizona and Dakota the revenue is inconsid-
erable, and the expense of collecting itso nearly
exhausts the receipts that at the date of the
Secretary's communication there was no avail-
able balance that could be applied to this pur-
pose.
Ihe Legislature of Washington passed an act
designating certain persons therein named as
a board ot commissioners to superintend the
erection of the penitentiary at such place as
they might select in the county of Pierce, at or
near the town of Steilacoom. By this act the
entire control ot the building is assumed by the
lenitory. ltprovides for the appointment of
a person to superintend its erection, and au-
thorizes the employment of the territorial con-
victs thereon, and for the payment into the
treasury of the Territory of such sum from the
penitentiary fund as their labor may be worth.
'The Legislature seems not to have been fully
aware of the provisions of the act of Congress.
The latter makes it the duty of the Secietarv
ot the Interior to approve the site, and pro"
vides that the buildings shall be constructed
under his direction. No action can, therefore,
under existing circumstances, be taken in the
premises by the Department. It is presumed
that the Legislature will amend its legislation
so as to make it conform to that of Congress.
An act has been passed by the Legislature of
Montana locating the penitentiary at Aro-enta
and appointing commissioners to select a^suita-
ble site lor said penitentiary at that place. The
commissioners have performed that duty, and
have made a report thereof to this Department
At an early day steps will be taken to have the
building erected m accordance with the pro-
visions of the act of Congress.
