APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
UnTted Statesike artieles imPorted in vessels of the
Taxation is an evil, but necessarily to be endured
to the extent fit and proper for the support of gov-
ernment prudently and economically administered.
U £ Se'j ,"gatIon of;duty arising out of the trusts
confided to the Congress by the constitution of the
United States dictate that taxation shall be made to
pear fairly and equally on all classes and on all citi-
zens m proportion' to their property, means, and
ability to pay, as nearly as human laws can accom-
push.
The power delegated to the Congress by the con-
stitution, to "lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,
and excises, to pay the debts and piovide for the
common defence and general welfare of the United
ates, ' is a high trust limited to the uses so ex-
pressly declared. It is granted in trust for all, not
lor the use of a part only; to be exercised by gene-
ral laws, not by partial laws, discreetly for the prop-
er purposes, and to discharge the duties imposed by
the constitution itself, not arbitrarily and to an il-
limitable extent.
So long as the Congress shall keep within the
confines of raising revenue necessary for the support
of government, to maintain the public credit, and
provide for the common defence and genera! welfare
the accidental encouragement and protection of do-
mestic manufactures arisingout of the mode oflevy-
lng such necessary revenue by duties on imports,
must be deemed rightful, as an inevitable attendant
upon the exercise of the delegated power.
To reduce the rates of duties to the standard of
the necessary revenue, is a task not without some
difficulties. The probability of a deficiency of rev-
enue is to be most carefully avoided; on the other
hand, a large surplus above the proper wants of the
government should be avoided. The desideratum
is the happy mean between those extremes.
With a scale of duties adapted to the sum of rev-
enue necessary and proper to supply the wants of
the government, economically administered; with
prudent and moderate discriminations, ranging
within the lowest and highest degrees of
duties which look to revenue, and are adapted to
raise the sum necessary and proper, it may be ex-
pected that the moderate and discreet of all parties
would be content; that such a system, adopted for
the future policy of the United Stales, and steadfast-
ly pursued, is best calculated to heal the discontents,
and promote the general prosperity and happiness.
The stability of the Union, the national wealth and
strength, and the general welfare, will be the best
promoted by such action on the part of the federal
government in exercising the power of taxation, as
will leave all that is not necessary to supply the
wants of the general government itself to the people
themselves, and the State governments and the fede-
ral government to revolve in their respective appro-
priate spheres.
The eyes of the world are turned to the United
States of_ America, watching the effects which the
novel political institution for the government of the
Union shall have upon the public and private pros-
Eerity and happiness. The glorious success which
as hitherto attended the experiment should inspire
sentiments of virtuous zeal and patriotism to con-
tinue its success and grandeur, by practising and in-
culcating those habits and dispositions, and that
spirit of amity, mutual deference, concession and
compromise, in which the constitution is found, so
that the Union may be perfected and cemented, and
the stability of the constitution and its blessings be
rendered perpetual.

$28,193,784 82
Which sum of expenditure, deductedfrom the
total of means before stated, gives an esti-
mated balance of, twelve millions four hun-
dred seventy-one thousand four hundred
forty-six dollars sixty-one cents to be in
the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1846 - $12,471,446 61
Note.—'The sum of $60,000 and interest, on account of
the debt assumed fqr the several cities in the District of
Columbia is includedin the aforegoing sum for civil list
and miscellaneous expenditures.
This estimated balance is liable t6 be increased by
such curtailment of the appropriations as asked by
the estimates, which the Congress may not deem fit
to authorize by appropriating the money; and by
such portions of the old funded debt, unfunded debt,
old treasury notes, and those of the late issues, and
Mississippi stock, which may not be presented for
payment, but shall be outstanding on the 1st July,
1846. It is liable to be diminished by such appro-
priations as the Congress shall make for expendi-
tures during the fiscal years ending on the 30th
June, 1845 and 1846, respectively, beyond the esti-
mates before stated.
Comparing the estimates made for the service in
the fiscal year ending 30'th June, 1846, with the
estimates for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1845,
the estimates of the War Department exceed those
for 1845 by the sum of $1,916,443 10; those of the
Wavy Department for 1846 exceed those for 1845 by
$517,640 12: the excesses conjointly amount to
£2,434,092 31. Comparing those estimates for the
fiscal year ending June 30th, 1846, with the actual
appropriations made by the Congress for those de-
partments for the fiscal year ending 30th June,
1845, the estimates for the War Department exceed
those appropriations by the sum of $5,286,329 16;
those estimates of the Navy Department exceed
those appropriations by the sum of $3,559,192 01:
excesses united amount to the sum of $9,845,521 17.
In estimating the receipts to be expected from the
customs under the act of 1842, the Secretary of the
.treasury has endeavored to ascertain the probable
amount of goods and merchandise , to be imported as
necessary for the consumption of the existing and
increasing population of the United States, and the
probable proportion of goods not paying, and those
paying duties. To that end he resorted not only to
the returns from the custom-houses since the pas-
sage of the act of 1842, but also to the consump-
tion as it progressed, from the year '1820 down to
the year 1842, noting the averaged importations and
consumption annually during the respective peri-
L°th SePtember, 1820, to 30th September,
j ' f"r t!le fo,,r from 1824 to 1828; four years
under; for four years from 1828 to 1832; and for the
ten years from 1832 to 1842. Those period* mark
the respective alterations in the rates of duty. He
likewise noted the averaged sums per year, during
those respective periods, of goods imported free of
duty, those paying duties, and the averaged exporr
tation of goods paying, and those not paying duties:
likewise the averaged annual sum for drawbacks,
allowances to fishing vessels, bounties for exporta-
tions of salted fish, and expenses of collection. -
It appears that revenue yielded from tee impor-
^r^,d|r ?£l842>for the nine montha
from 30th September, 1842, to 30th of June, 1843
averaged upon the goods paying duty, was equivl
alent to a duty ad valorem of thirty-seven dollars
eighty-four cents and one mill upon every hun-
dred dollars; for the whole year from 30th Sentom
ber, 1842, to. 30th September, 1843, Z\fCed
duty was equivalent to a net revenue of thirtv-lve
dollars five cents and five mills upon every hun.
died? dollars m value of goods paying duty; that for
the importations from 30th June, 1843, to 30th June
1844, the net revenue received into the treasury
was equivalent to a duty of thirty-three doE
eighty-Jive cents and nine mills uPon the hundred
dollars of goods paying duty; .that from 30th Sep,
