Brigadier-General CROXTON,

Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I inclose herewith a copy of a dispatch just received.*

Please send word to everybody to be on the alert, and particularly in the direction of Jonesborough. If not already done, you had better extend your left in that direction sufficiently to connect with Upton, or at least to communicate with him.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,May 10, 1865.

Major BEAUMONT, Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: A man named Clarke, who lives some miles from here on the Perry road, states positively that Jeff. Davis was at Americus on Tuesday, the 2nd of May. He asserts that he saw him; that he was traveling in a close carriage with General Pillow, who made a speech at Americus the evening before. Is it not possible that Jeff. Davis was not with the force at Washington? The uncertainty about his movements since leaving that place makes it, I think, probable that the movement in that direction was simply a blind to cover his escape. Have you learned anything new of his whereabouts or movements?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Macon, Ga., May 10, 1865 - 8 p. m.

General Palmer has just telegraphed that Jeff. Davis crossed the Apalachee River at 11.30, 8th instant, near Salem, northeast of Covington, from thence to Fairplay, in Morgan County. The utmost vigilance is enjoined on officers and men of the division along the Ocmulgee River, as from the information received he certainly has not as yet crossed that river. Colonel Howland will at once send several parties, of an officer and twenty-five men each, east of the river to patrol the country well far and wide.

By command of Colonel R. H. G. Minty:
