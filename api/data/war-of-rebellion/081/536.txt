HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Deep Bottom, June 30, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps:

The officer of the day reports that the enemy appear to be leaving my front. I have ordered some of my pickets pushed forward and will let you know the result as soon as I can ascertain. The gun-boats Agawam and Mendota just passed through the draw, going below for the purpose of engaging the rebel battery.

Yours, respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-The Agawam has passed the battery and was not fired upon.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps:

The gun-boats have been shelling the battery for some time without obtaining any reply. I think the guns have been withdrawn. The officer of the day has just sent in a dispatch that he has a post of observation near Ruffin's house, and that the enemy appear in considerable numbers in the woods in rear of the house.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, June 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

The enemy's pickets were developed in about the same force and short distance in rear of their position of yesterday. The gun-boats have been shelling the battery all the morning without obtaining a reply. I think the guns have been withdrawn from their positions.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL FOSTER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

The enemy opened about half an hour ago on my earth-works below Four-Mile Creek with apparently two of the pieces engaged yesterday, firing some fifteen or twenty shots. As near as I can locate their position, it is at Maiden Hall. The Frenchman who lives at Allen's farm reports that they passed there this morning. I have not heard from the garrison of the work, but think that no damage has been done thus far.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
