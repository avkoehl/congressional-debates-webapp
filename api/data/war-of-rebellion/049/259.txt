Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

The summary of news of to-day:

The enemy were stampeded this morning by the several moving columns of the Sixth Corps, some of which passed near the river. They fired an alarm gun. Since which time they have noticed that the position of Stone-House Mountain is evacuated, and that the Second Corps has moved to the rear. I think from this they must fully appreciate the movement.
