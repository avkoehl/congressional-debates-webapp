required to carry the proposed measure mto full
effect Th s small addition is all that is* proposed
or required to execu e a measure designed exten-
sively to diminish Executive pationage by dispen
sing entirely with the agency of binks, and by
separating that branch of our Government from all
control and influence overa pov erful as^ocia ion of
corporations, \uth thousands of directors, oflicets,
and stock* old rs If an nn| oruit measure is to
le rejected, because nine cleiks art tobe added
to the numbernow in the public service, we should,
with equal reas an, stop the progress ot legislation,
for scarcely a session passes in which Congress is
not compelled to authorize the emploj ment of a
greater number ol officers to cairy into effect the
vanous laws requued m the administration oi the
affairs of our rapidly glowing country
The same mistake as to the íe-ponsibililies of
oui ovni officers, has produced an erroneous im-
pression that we are now, for the first time, about
to place the public money in their custody. De
falcations are consequently appieheaded, and to
avoid these¡ a special deposite of ihe public money
in banks for safe-keeping is ad\ ooated by some
uho are decidedly favorable to tie separation

irol of our own officers moot of it Vas afterward-,

ded to disbursing officers We hue hid general!),
very inadequate security, and, in many instances,
especially as it regaids disbursing otficeis, not even
the ordinary security of bonds Undei such loose
regulations the -wonder is that our losses were not
greater, considering the immense amount which
has passed'hrough the hauls of our officers Our
collectors have had under their contiol a gross re-
venue of 946,000,000 dollars, and our land icceiv-
ers 107,000 000 dollars, making 1,053,000,000 dol-
lars They not onlj had the control of th s vas

about two millions and a hilf, ben g less than one
auarter of one per cent on the amount leceivcd by
th m since 1789 But the larger proportion cv en
of the balances now standi ig on the Treasury
books, arises from the death ot ome, and the
negligence of other public officers m not tiansrait-
ting their vouchers, or fiom mere ineguhrity ir
informality The coliectoi ire ch j^rd with all
the bonds, whether they are pail or not, and the
receivers with t - lands «o'd whether the have re-
ceived the money or not Somaiin s the touchers
are lost or destroyed, and mmy ap| hex ions have
been, from time to time, m iue to Congicss, to en
able theTreasmy to settle the accounts of officers,
who, though not indebted to Government, have
been for years, at d are still, reported a3 default
ers Prom the best estima es hi it can be made at
the Treasur), not mere than one militen of these
balances is acluallv due to Gov inment firm our
collectors and receivers of pub .e money, leeving
a probable loss of about o íe tenth of one per cent
of the amount under their charge and control We
have lost nothing by the disbursing officers of the
aim) propel for twenty years past, and, as to other
disbursmB officers, e have generally neDleoted to
require security ot them
These losses by public officers cannot, however,
be urged as an argumert in favor of employing
banks, as they have-, win little exception, all
occurred while the Utter were the ?gents of the
Treasury We have, moreover, at the "ame time,
lo-t moje m proportion b> bfi ks than by oui o vn
officers Throwing aside the millions lost by then
depreciated paper, and commencing with the Bank
of the United States in 1817, and after the resump-
tion of specie payments, our losses amounted, m
seventeen years, by bank depositories, to $1,075,954,
and by bank notes $178,470, making f 1,254,424,
of which there is no prospect ol our ever recov ermg
any part Assuming that, fiom 1817 to 1834, our
deposites in all the banks amounted to §350,000,000,
the actual loss in seventeen years would be nearly
thiee-eighths of one per cent while the probable
loss by all our collectors and receivers in foity-nme
years cumot be estimated at more than about one-
tenth of one p°r cent Wt have besides, by the
recent revulsion, a suspend-d debt due from the
diposite banks of §5 925 800, and $4,000 000 more
to the credit of om disbursing officers What part
ol this we may lose cannot now be estimated We
shall be fortunate if we have not occasion heieal-
ter to double the amount ot the losses before
referred to But we have at least ascertained that,
in seventeen years of peace and genetal ptospenty,
and dining the existence of a National Bank, we
hive lost more by this connection with banks than
the amount ot all our losses by collectors and
receivers in torn-nine >ear«, though the former
wire entrusted with about slo0,000,000 only, and
the lattei with sl,0o3 000 000
While we <uo thus exposed to heavy losses by
employing banks, the lcnewal of tins agency would
noi, in the slightest degree, diminish oui chance of
1 > -, by public othceis The employment of banks
cannot lemove the necessity ot confiding to our
own officers in collecting and disbursing the public
money, unless we abolish our custom-houses, land
oil ces, anl disbursing agencies, and assign all the
duties ol Go\ eminent to banks Under no prac-
ticable system can we avoid trusting our own offi-
cers with the public money, as we have done from
the origin of our Government Ioitunately, our
expenence of their fidelity does not warrant the
withdrawal of our confidence In collecting moie
than a thousand millions, our probable loss does
not exceed the tenth part of one per cent and at
the principal point of collection it is far less At

And, finally, should anv o Pier use or ^mbez/le
the money entrusted to him, he sh^ll ke convicted
of felon), fined, and imprisoned Most of our cus-
tom house and land r fiVe? ue plready furnished
with vauH or safe , or both, for the pteservation
of the public aichives and public money, but, to
provide for every such contingency, an appropria-
tion of ten thousand dollara is proposed, which is
the only new appropriation authorized by the bill.
With all these additional guards for the collection,
safe-keeping, and disbursement of the public reve-
nue, the losses of Government, under the proposed
plan, will be much less than under any other hith-
erto adopted, independent of our losses by banks
and their paper
The objection which deserves most consideration
is, that a large surplus might accumulate m the
Treasury, and operate injuriously upon the
banks, if it consisted entirely of specie To obvi-
ate this, the Secretary of the Treasury recommends
that any surplus above four millions ot dellars
should be invested in stocks, to be sold whenever
the Treasuiy should want the money Aware of
the importance of providing against an unnecessa-
ry surplus, the committee have duly considered this
proposition, but feel constrained to reject it The
main object ot the plan now proposed i  to confine
the Tieasury exclusively to the collection, transfer,
and disbursement of the public money b) the most
simple, economical, and safe means It is not de-
signed that the Treasury should either be a finan-
cier or a banker, further than may be absolutely
necessary in the collection and disbursement of our
revenue To connect it either with stocks or banks
would be incompatible with this design The occa-
sional investment of our surplus might also pro-
duce other evils Our dealings in stock would be
anticipated by thee engaged in that trade, and
speculations would be founded on the fluctuations
of our Treasury Congress too would neglect one
of its first duties, which is to reduce our taxes when-
ever the revenue exceeds the wantsof Government
A permanent law, graduating our income to our
expenditure, may be hereafter adopted, when all
our duties are levied ad valorem, as is proposed
by the act of March, 1833, to take effect m 1842
But, for the present, no investment, or any
other measure is necessary, as we have no
reason whatever to apprehend a surplus The
twenty-seven millions deposited with the States
is wholly unavailable, the debt of the United
fetates Bank is payable in three annual in-
stalments, and the six millions of suspended
balances due from the deposite banks will not be
paid for some time to come Cur revenue, both
trom customs and lands, is very much reduced,
while our militaiy expenditures are unavoidably
increasing, and further and extraordinary appro-
pnations must be made for the piesent yeai, and
may be required m 1839 The Treasury notes
which were authorized to be issued al the late ses-
sion are receivable for public dues, and cannot be
re-issued This makes a charge of some millions
on the revenue of the present year equal to the
amount of the notes received at our custom houses
and land offices It is obvious that, far from being
a surplus, there will be a deficiency,-which must
be supplied either by a re-issue of the Treasury
notes redeemed, or by an authority to issue others
There is not the least p-obabilily that o ir revenue,
for two years to come, will be eqifl to the wants
of Government, and if, foi ¡he next I mr years, it
should be sufficient to meet our expendí ures, and
to redeem the Treasuiy no es which have been or
may be herealter, issued, it wil) be full as much as
can be reasonably anticipated In the mean time,
our tariff is in a process of ícductton, and a'ter
June, 1842, the highest íate will be twenty per
cent ad valorem, payable in c?sh When it is
considered that one-half of our importations are
free of duty, it is obvious that, so far from antici-
pating a surplus of rev enue from this source, Go-
vernment will be compelled to rely, more than it
has done hitherto, on its income from public
lands for its support The proposed warehousing
system would also tend to keep the revenue
down, as merchandise would only be enteied as
it m ght be required foi consumption The Trea-
sury notes rc(uired for the service of 1838 and
1839, will only be issued to discharge claims, or,
as the money may be wanted, and any surplus
which may accrue in 1840 and 1841, will be im-
mediately applnd to theincdempticn In 1849 the
ad valoiem taiiff take, effect, and the balance in.
the Treasury will be easily regulated by Congress
No surplus can, therefore, be anticipated, nor is
