rupt's property and estate pro rata, -without
any priority or preference whatever, except
that wages due from him to any operative, or
clerk, or house servant, to an amount not ex-
ceeding fifty dollars, for labor performed within
six mouths next preceding the adjudication of
bankruptcy, shall be entitled to priority, and
shall be first paid in full: Provided, That any
debt proVted by any person liable, as bail,
surety, guarantor, or otherwise, for the bank-
rupt, shall not be paid to the person so prov-
ing the same until satisfactory evidence shall ;
be produced of the payment of such debt by 1
such person so liable, and the share to which
such debt would be entitled may be paid into ,
court, or otherwise held for the benefit of the
party entitled thereto, as the court may direct.
At the expiration of three months from the
date of the adjudication of bankruptcy in any
case, or as much earlier as the court may
direct, the court, upon request of the assignee,
shall call a general meeting of the creditors,
of which due notice shall be given, and the
assignee shall then report, and exhibit to the
court and to the creditors just and true ac-
counts of all his receipts and payments, veri-
fied by his oath, and he shall also produce and
file vouchers for all payments for which vouch-
ers shall be required by arry rule of the court;
he shall also submit the schedule of the bank-
rupt's creditors and property as amended, duly
verified by the. bankrupt, and a statement of
the whole estate of the bankrupt as then ascer-
tained, of the property recovered and of the
property outstanding, specifying the cause of
its being outstanding, also what debts or claims
are yet undetermined, and stating what sum
remains in his hands. At such meeting the
majority in value of the creditors present shall
determine whether any and what part of the
net proceeds of the estate, after deducting and
retaining a sum sufficient to provide for all
undetermined claims which, by reason of the
distant residence of the creditor, or for other
sufficient reason, have not been proved, and
for other expenses and contingencies, shall be
divided among the creditors; but unless at
least one half in value of the creditors shall
attend such meeting, either in person or by
attorney, it shall be the duty of the assignee
so to determine. In case a dividend is or-
dered, the register shall, within ten days after
such meeting, prepare a list of creditors en-
titled to dividend, and shall calculate and set
opposite to the name of each creditor who has
proved his claim the dividend to which he is
entitled out of the net proceeds of the estate
set apart for dividend, and shall forward by
mail to every creditor a statement of the divi-
dend to which he is entitled, and such creditor
shall be paid by the assignee in such manner
as the court may direct.
Sec. 28. And be it further enacted, That the
like proceedings shall be had at the expiration
of the next three months, or earlier, if practi-
cable, and a third meeting of creditors shall
then be called by the court, and a final divi-
dend then declared, unless any-action at law
or suit in equity be pending, or unless some
other estate or effects of the debtor afterwards
come to the hands of the assignee, in which
case the assignee shall, as soon as may be,
convert such estate or effects into money, and
within two months after the same shall be so
converted the same shall be divided in manner
aforesaid. Further dividends shall be made
in like manner as often as occasion requires ;
and after the third meeting of creditors no
further meeting shall be called, unless ordered
by the court. If at any time there shall be in
the hands of the assignee any outstanding debts
or other property, due or belonging to the
estate, which cannot be collected and received
by the assignee without unreasonable or incon-
venient delay or expense, the assignee may,
under the direction of the court, sell and assign
such debts or other property in such manner
ag the court shall order. No dividend already
declared shall be disturbed by reason of debts
being subsequently proved, but the creditors
proving such debts shall be entitled to a divi-
dend equal to those already received by the
other creditors before any further payment is
made to the latter. Preparatory to the final
dividend, the assignee shall submithis account
to the court and file the same, and give notice
to the creditors of such filing, and shall also
give notice that he will apply for a settlement
of his account, and for a discharge from all
liability as assignee, at a time to be specified
in such notice, and at such time the court shall
audit and pass the accounts of the assignee,
and such assignee shall, if required by the j
court, be examined as to the truth of such
S account, and if found correct he shall thereby |
be discharged from all liability as assignee to
| any creditor of the bankrupt. The court shall
thereupon order a dividend of the estate and i
' effects, or of such part thereof as it sees fit,
among such of the creditors as have proved
: their claims, in proportion to the respective j
amount of their said debts. In addition to all
expenses necessarily incurred by him in the
execution of his trust, in any case, the assignee |
shall be entitled to an allowance for his ser- i
vices in such case on all moneys received and (
paid out by him therein, for any sum not ex-
ceeding one thousand dollars, five per centum
thereon ; for any larger sum, not exceeding
five thousand dollars, two and a half per
centnm on the excess over one thousand dol-
lars ; and for any larger sum, one per centnm
on the excess over five thousand dollars, and
if, at any time, there shall not be in his hands
a sufficient amount of money to defray the
necessary expenses required for the further
execution of his trust, he shall not be obliged
to proceed therein until the necessary funds
are advanced or satisfactorily secured to him.
If by accident, mistake, or other cause, with-
out fault of the assignee, either or both of the
said second and third meetings should not be
held within the times limited, the court may,
upon motion of an interested party, order such
meetings, with like effect as to the validity of
the proceedings as if the meeting had been
duly held. In the order for a dividend, under
this section, the following claims shall be enti-
tled to priority or preference, and to be first
paid in full in the following order:
First. The fees, costs, and expenses of suits,
and the several proceedings in bankruptcy
under this act, and for the custody of property,
as herein provided.

collection of taxes by the authority of the Uni-
ted States or any State.

granted to the bankrupt. No discharge shall
be granted, or, if granted, be valid, if the
bankrupt has willfully sworn falsely in his affi-

inventory, or upon any examination in the
course of the proceedings in bankruptcy, in
relation to any material fact concerning his
estate or his debts, or to any other material
fact; or if he has concealed any part of his

mitted, or suffered any loss, waste, or destruc-

to defraud his creditors; or has removed or
caused to be removed any part of his property

of his property, or has lost any part thereof in
