Informant thinks Scales' brigade is lying to the right of McGowan's. Has only been in the army but a week and has little information. The accompanying report* from officer at City Point that Scales' brigade has gone to North Carolina is not corroborated by our information here. Deserter yesterday reports having seen Scales' brigade the day before. The report that Kirkland's brigade has been attached to Hoke's division is perhaps erroneous, and may have arisen from the fact that General Kirkland has taken command of Martin's old brigade, of Hoke's division; but General MacRae is commanding the old Pettigrew brigade, still attached to Heth's division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
HDQRS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT,November 14, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The several signal stations have no changes or movements to report, excepting about 4.40 p. m. a small body of troops was apparently moving toward the left, as was indicated by the glistening of bayonets over the work to the west of what we term the large fort near the Weldon railroad. They were four or five minutes passing.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac.
