(Received 8. 19 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

General Sandford has just returned to town. I have seen Governor Seymour's order of yesterday. It will be impossible to get off any troops under it for several days. General Sandford and I have telegraphed him for a peremptory order for the regiments to go at once.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

NEW YORK, N. Y., July 10, 1864.

(Received 2. 45 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

The Governor's third order in regard to the militia was received night before last. General Sandford issued his orders to colonels of the designated regiments yesterday, and went into the country last evening. His second in command is doing all he can. I am acting with him, and no effort will be spared to get the troops to the field.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864.

Major-General DIX,

New York:

Can you inform me when the troops will leave New York. Please hurry them forward.

By order of Brigadier-General Morris:

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEW YORK, July 10, 1864.

General MORRIS,

Commanding:

About 600 men have left or are leaving. I have been trying all day to get off the militia regiments. Hope to succeed by to-morrow morning.

JOHN A. DIX.

(Received 12th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Yours of 10. 30 p. m. yesterday received, and very satisfactory.

The enemy will learn of Wright's arrival, and then the difficulty will be to unite Wright and Hunter south of the enemy before he will recross the Potomac. Some firing between Rockville and here now.

A. LINCOLN.
