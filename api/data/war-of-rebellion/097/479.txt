HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

General WEBB:

Your dispatch of 9 a.m. received. I have shown it to General Grant, and he thinks with me that there is no danger of an attack. I have returned to the point where we broke through this morning. Have sent a brigade to support General Parke left, and will move immediately against Petersburg the rest of the force.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865-9 a.m.

Major-General WEBB,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I am holding my old line from Fort Howard to Fort Welch. It seems to me that if I continue to advance I should bring in the garrisons and picket-line and send the artillery to City Point; and is there any objection to bringing my trains up here?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865. (Received 9.15 a.m.)

Major-General WEBB:

We have swept along the enemy's line for considerable distance. Am now halting to reform our lines and await support. We have captured 1,000 prisoners and a great many guns.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

Major-General WEBB:

I have succeeded perfectly so far. I have captured many guns and flags, and I think from 2,000 to 3,000 prisoners. We are now about a mile from Hatcher's Run, having moved to our left, down enemy's works from the front where we attacked. I must be re-enforced or I shall lose all that I have gained. My rear also should be looked after, as I only left a brigade where I broke through.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,April 2, 1865-9.40 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

General Grant has General Ord to cover your left and assist you. Our troops are accumulated on the left and are moving up the Boydton road. Lookout for your right and rear.

GEO. G. MEADE.
