HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS, July 7, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel F. A. WALKER,Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

COLONEL: I beg leave to call the attention of the major-general commanding the corps to what purports to be a letter from Brigadier-General Barlow in the Washington Chronicle of yesterday. I have no desire to resort to the public papers, either to correct what may possibly be regarded as errors or to establish a reputation for my troops, even were such a course not a violation of long established and well known orders; but whilst observing this rule myself, I claim for my command the protection of my military superiors against any one who, disobeying the order, appeals to the public prints to correct what he may deem to be erroneous. I have not seen the statement referred to by General Barlow, but if the loss in my division on the 22nd of June was not caused by, or connected with, the falling back of his, it appears to me the fact could be established in a proper military way, without resorting to the public papers and to undignified, unmilitary, and unjust aspersions against another command.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
