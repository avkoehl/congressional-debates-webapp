IE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 8,

Mr. CHAMBERS suggested that it was de-
sirable to bring before the committee the lately dis-
missed Secretary, who had intimated that he would
disclose nothing unless legally required.
Mr. POINDEXTER said a general investiga-
tion was desirable, with a view to bring all the
members of the Cabinet before the committee, as
well those who had, as those who had not given
their opinions in writing.
Mr. BIBB said he had no objection to an in-
quiry But he hoped the gentleman [Mr. Poindex-
ter] would not press the question. He felt that
we were touching on delicate ground in proposing
to call before a committee the Piesident's Cabinet
counsellors. He had no objection to a call on the
President, there could be no doubt of the right of
the Senate to make such a call But he wished
time to think of the propriety and dignity of the
Senate calling for what took place befoie the Pres-
ident's Cabinet, out of respect for the constitutional
authorities of the country.
Mr. CLAY then moved that the subject be laid
on the table; which was agreed to.
SPECIAL ORDER OP  THE DAT.
The special order having been taken up,
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN took the floor, and
addiessed the Chair in opposition to the reasons of
the Secretary of the Treasury for removing the
deposites, until three o'clock, when he gave way
to a motion by Mr. WILKINS, that the Senate
adjourn, which prevailed.
And the Senate adjourned.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, February 3, 1834.
After the reading of the Journal the several
States being called for the presentation of memo-
rials, &c ,
Mr PARKS rose and said that, by the courtesy
of his colleague, he had to present to the House
certain resolutions from the Legislature of the State
of Maine, in relation to the recent removal of ihe
deposites, and the question of rechartenng the
Bank of the United States These resolutions
went to justify the course pursued by the Admin
istration in that removal, and showed that they
weie opposed.to any recharter of that bank He
took leave to say that the Legislature of that State
was composed of one hundred and eighty-six mem-
bers in the House of Representatives, and of twen-
ty-five in the Senate These resolutions had been
passed «i the House of Representatives by the
large vote of 119 to 53, and through the Senate by
a vote of 22 to 2, and he believed they were passed
by a body of men as able, as intelligent, and patri-
otic, and as truly respectable, as any body ot men
in the Union This respectable body, then, came
forward to state that, in their opinion, the bank
was unconstitutional, and they believed this, be-
cause they thought that Congress had no power
given to them by the Constitution to grant such a
charter; holding that all poweis not expressly
granted by the Constitution aie reserved to the
several States They further believe that upon
this question of the removal of the deposites now
depends, and is identical with, the recharter of
the bank, and that, if the bank is not to be re-
chartered, their restoration would be improper
Thus believing, they had instructed their Senators
and requested their Representatives in Congress I
to oppose the restoiation of the deposites and the
renewal of the charter of the United States Bank
They also believe that the distress which has
been brought upon our commercial communities,
has been produced by the improper action of the
bank upon the public, with a view to cause dis-
content at the recent measures of Government,
end thus force from Congress a restoration of the
deposites It was evident, then, that if the bank
by producing this distress was successful in their
object—when she would think theproper moment
had arrived for her to do so, to ask for a renewal
of the chai ter—she would only have to put her ma-
chinery in motion, rack her victims, and through
the agonizing throes thus produced, compel Con-
gress to yield to her application Thus yielding
once to her, it would only be a prelude to their
yielding again He, therefore, felt with them, that |
the present was thetime to meet the question, and ,
to resist it.                                                           I
The Legislature of this State were the advocates
of State rights They fully adopted the doctrines
put forth by the State of Virginia, and they be-
lieved if the bank shouldprove successful in throw-
ing her golden chains around them, the words
State rights, nullification, and secession, would be
mere terms, more fit to be bandied by the lips of
children than to be used by freemen.
Mr. P. having called for the reading of the res-
olutions, they were read as follow, and subse
quently referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means.
STATE OF MAINE.
Whereas, at an early period after the election
of Andrew Jackson to the Presidency, in accord-
ance with the sentiments which he had uniformly
expressed, the attention of Congress was called to
the constitutionality and expediency of the re-
newal of the charter of the United States Bank, and
whereas the bank has transcended us chartered
limits in the management of its business transac-
tions, and has abandoned the object of its creation,
by engaging in political controversies, by wielding
its power and influence to embarrass the admin-
istration of the General Government, and by bring-
ing insolvency and distress upon the commercial
community, and whereas the public security fiom
such an institution consists less in its present pe-
cuniary capacity to discharge its liabilities than
in the fidelity with which the trusts reposed in it
have been executed, and whereas the abuse and
misapplication of the powers conferred have de-
stroyed the confidence of the public in the officers
of the bank, and demonstrated that such powers
endanger the stability of republican institutions,
therefore
Resolved, That m the removal of the public
deposites trom the Bank of the United States as
well as in the manner of their removal, we recog-
nize m the Administration an adheience to con
stitutional i ights, and the performance of a public
duty
Resohed, That this Legislature entertain the
same opinion as heretofore expiessed by the pre-
ceding Legislatme of this State, that the Bank of
the United States ought not to be recharteied
Resolved, That the Senators of this State in the
Congiess of the United States be instructed, and
the Representatives be requested, to oppose the
restoration of the deposites and the renewal of the
charter of the Uni'ed States Bank
Resohed, That the Governor be requested to
transmit a copy of this preamble and these resolves
to the President of the Senate of the United States,
and to each of our Senators and Representatives
in Congress.

Mr. SMITH, of Mame, said: I hold m my hand
a communication in the shape of resolutions passed
at a public meeting holden in the city of Port
land, in the district which I have the honor to rep-
resent on this floor They relate to the existing
state of the currency m this country, and to the
removal of the public deposites from the Bank of
the United States They also embody a request i
that the Repieseitatives from Maine would cause
them to be laid befoie the House, and give their
support to them
In compliance with that part of the request
which asks to have them laid before this House, I
beg leave to lay them upon your table In lela- |
tion to the other part which asks my support of
them, I feel constrained to decline With the per-
mission of the House I will briefly advert to some
of the reasons why I do so decline.
It will be observed that in one of the resolutions
the alleged distress in the money market is attrib-
uted to the measures of the National Government
in the removal of the public deposites from the
Bank of the United States. This resolution pro-
ceeds to say, " that the removal of the public
' money from the Bank of the United States has
' had a tendency to derange the cuirency of the
' country, and to produce the embarrassments
' which now exist m the money market, for the
' bank having curtailed its accommodations to the
' public over $9,000,000 m the five months preced-
' ing the first of Januaiy, has not only withdrawn
' that large amount from circulation, but has pro-
' duced a corresponding curtailment in the aceom-
' modations of the State banks, and thus increased
' the evil and cieated alarm throughout the whole
' commercial community "
Sir, said Mr S , that there exists a pressure
in the money market of that region whence these
resolutions have emanated, is not for me to deny.
That it is attributable, properly, to the removal of
the deposites from the United States Bank is a
proposition to which I cannot assent, and I think
that in the resolution itself, to which I have ad-
verted, an argument is embodied which illus-
trates to every candid mind the fallacy of such
a conclusion In order to show the tendency of
the measure complained of, reference is had to
the operations of the bank for Jive months preced-
ing the first of January last. This reference, sir,
embraces a period of two months anterior to the
existence of the measure complained of The
fact that the authors of these íesolutions felt com-
pelled thus to go back of the period when that
measure first existed, in order to prove the tend-
ency of it after it existed, and in order to trace
the existing state of things home to it, is to my
mind a satisfactory exposure of the fallacy of the
reasoning upon which these resolutions rest
In another of these resolutions it is said that
the pressuie m the finances of the country is so
great that an union of all parties existed to give
utterance to them     In yet another of them, how-
ever, we are told that they express only the opm-
1 ions of "a portion" of the citizens of Portland.
Sir, this was prudent    If they had undertaken
more—if they had assumed to attribute these opin-
ions to the generality of the citizens of Portland,
I or to the generality of the citizens of Cumber'and
I district, 1 am sure that the rush of the multitude
would have been down upon them, and their feeble
utterance would have been drowned by popular
acclamation of an opposite import ere they could
have reached this Hall of legislation
Sir, I have had an opportunity of becoming ac-
quainted with the political his'ory and opinions of
all the gentlemen whose names are associated with
these resolutions And, sir, I am pleased to say—
I am pleased in being able to say, that with a sin-
gle exception, there is not an individual among
them who has not been, from the beginning, either
opposed to all the leading measures of the present
National Administration, or a friend to the Bank of
the United States A majority of them, sir, have
had their nam°s associated no less distinctly with
every measure of opposition to the present Ad-
ministration whicn has been at any time con-
certed in the city of Portland If they had now
presented themselves in any other attitude than
that of hostility to the measure complained of, it
would have excited my surprise* I must admit,
sir, still that I feel surprise at the association of
two or three of these names with these resolutions.
Not, sir, that the gentlemen to whom I allude ex-
hibit now evidences of their opposition to the Ad-
ministration, but I am surprised at it from other
considerations I am surprised because I know
them to be directors of a bank in the city of Poit-
land, which was among the fust and sioi/tesi of the
banks to make application to the Treasury De-
partment for the keeping of these same public de-
posites, and before their removal from the United
States Bank I hold in my hand, sir, a copy of
the official application of the oank of which the
gentlemen alluded to are directors, tendering the
services of their bank to the Government, and thus
encouraging and inducing the very removal now
complained of1 Sir, it cannot be doubted that
these gentlemen then regarded this measure as
necessary, just, and patriotic. Then, sir, they
regarded this measure, to use the language of the
gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr McDüi-fie,]
" as fair a thing as ever was " But now, sir, the
deposites having been removed, and these gentle-
men having found that another bank in Portland
has been prefeited by the Government to their
own for keeping those deposites, the measure of
removal is censuied by them and condemned, and
they gravely resolve in public meeting that it is
