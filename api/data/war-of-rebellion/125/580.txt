Brigadier General JAMES B. FRY:

The provost-marshal of the Nineteenth District of New York telegraphs me as follows:

What mode or means is there of preventing persons enrolled and liable to draft from leaving the district or State before being drafted? A stampede is going on that threatens to be serious unless checked. I know of no remedy. Can they be stopped on the border of the State? Are there any means of checking this exodus? Answer immediately, by request of towns interested.
