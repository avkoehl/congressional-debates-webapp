HEADQUARTERS, BEYOND MARTINSBURG, VA.,May 25, 1862-5.30 p. m.

All communication is cut off. We know not what has occurred at Harper's Ferry, &amp;c. A prisoner captured this p. m. says the rebel force in our rear is to be strengthened; that their purpose is to enter Maryland at two Points-Harper's Ferry and Williamsport. He confirms all we have heard in regard to the rebel force here. We all pass the Potomac to-night safe-men, trains, and all, I think-making a march of 35 miles.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 25, 1862.

General BANKS,

William sport, via Hagerstown:

Two of your telegrams have been received. They have greatly relieved our anxiety respecting you command. We hope you are by this time entirely safe. Your gallantry and skill and the valiant bravery of you command are deserving of great praise. General Sawton is at Harper's Ferry, with over 3,000 to 5,000 men. We have sent a large force of artillery to that point, which will reach there by daylight. Please report again as soon as possible.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WILLIAMSPORT, May 26, 1862.

(Received 9 a. m.)

We believe that our whole force, trains and all, will cross in safety. The men are in fine spirits and crossing in good order. The labor of last night was fearful. The enemy followed us last night on the march, but has not made his appearance this morning. The news of your movements South has unquestionably caused them to look for their safety. Your dispatch was read to the troops this morning amid the heartiest cheers.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Major-General BANKS, Williamsport:

Your telegram this morning received. We rejoice greatly at your safety. Do you need any ammunition to enable you to dispute the enemy's crossing the river, or anything else?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
