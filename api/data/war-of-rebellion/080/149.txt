Are the enemy in force there or weak? If there is apparently an opportunity to carry their works take advantage of it and push forward your troops.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch just received. It is difficult to say how strong the enemy may be in my front. He has batteries along the whole of it. I will watch for the first opportunity. I can see the whole line well where I am. The enemy has been running from his first line in front of General Burnside's right for some minutes, but [there] seems to be a very heavy line of troops just behind it in high breast-works. There is a battery in front of General Burnside's left, which fires toward the river the same as it did on the 18th of June, and which our artillery fire has but very little effect on.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just received a report from my line on the center and left. The enemy opened with musketry when our firing commenced, but our own fire kept down, and also that of all their artillery, except in the second line on the main ridge, from which they fire a little. Major Fitzhugh, of the artillery, is badly wounded by a musket-ball in the thigh. None of the enemy have left my front that we can see.
