escapes, but while there are so many sympathizers outside to influence and bride sentinels escapes will continue to be made. The charges which I sent in May 20 against Lieutenant Higgins, Twenty-third Illinois Regiment, for aiding or attempting to aid prisoners to escape have not been noticed, and the exemption from punishment in his case may have induced others to have had less fear of following his example and they would otherwise have left.

I inclose also the report* from Captain Freedley, my assistant, in relation to the state of things at Camp Butler, Springfield, Ill., to which I beg attention as showing the difficulty of preparing rolls of the prisoners there confined. Until recently Colonel P. Morrison, of the Regular Army, my senior, was in command there. No rolls were sent with the prisoners to the camp and it appears that in giving an account of themselves they would at one time say one thing and at another they would contradict it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo. From the last paragraph I judge that erroneous impressions are entertained as to what labor is required of prisoners of war and what they are willing to go. I beg leave to call attention to my letters of the 10th ultimo to which yours is a reply in which I clearly state that the work is to be done by the prisoners, and I believe that they have not at any time refused to work even in cases of doubtful propriety, such as putting up fences that we may hold them with greater security.

My great desire has been to be governed by the strictest economy in all cases, and no work will be hired that can properly be done by the prisoners themselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel J. H. TUCKER, Commanding Camp Douglas, Chicago.

COLONEL: Your letter of the 21st is received. The order for the removal of prisoners to Sandusky was necessary to Captain Potter as part of his vouchers and it was therefore proper to furnish him a copy. It is only under such circumstances that it is proper for him to ask for copies of orders or letters. An order from you based on my order does away with the necessity of furnishing him a copy of my order. He should give his reasons for asking for a copy.

Four physicians with four attendants should be ample to attend to 275 sick, and I could not consent to increase the number even if there
