it would establish vast manufactories ia oar coun-
try to refine, not domestic, but foreign sugars; and
that it wiuld cause immense exportations of this
article for the mere benefit of the drawback, the
one-fifth part of which would be a mere graiuity
from the Treasury. This is what I said in De-
cember, 1828, when the bill for the increased draw-
back was on its passage in this chamber; and all the
evils which I then foresaw and denounced, were
ia a state of sufficiently rapid development when
tbe compromise act of 1833 came into life,
and aggravated tenfold the evils of the act
of 1829. By this compromise act, the almost in-
credible, and certainly unparalleled error was com-
mitted, of reducing duties without reducing the
drawbacks founded upon them-, an error which has
had the direct effect of going at once to the
n* flus ultra of the protective system, that off rant-
ing bounti s out of the Treasury; a speces of pro-
tect on, which General Hamilton failed to esta-
blish in 1791, and which then, and ever smce, has
been admitted to be as flagrantly unconstitutional
a« it is grossly unjust to the community. The com-
promise act has established this species of protec-
tion, and new let ns fee its operation in relat on to
refined sugar; and now let us see its effect in stimu-
lating the importation of foreign sugars, increasing
the exportation of refined sugars, and increasing
the amount of drawback from the Treasury. Theje
results are seen in the Treasury returns, wh ch
have been communicated to the Senate, and printed
by its order. Taking these returns trom the year
1S28-9, when the erroneous legislation in relaton
to sugar first begun, and the successive importa-
tion are:

. Here is an increase of near three to one in
about ten years; an increase which is beyond all
proportion to the increased population and com-
merce of the country; an increase which h; s not
been affected by the panics and distresses at home,
and which is upwards of twice as great in the ru-
inous years of 1837 and 1838, as it was in the
year 1832, when the Bank of the United States
was in the zenith of its power and glory. Such
an increase is unnatural and factitious, and an-
nounces the existence of some occult cau^e to
stimulate and extend this branch of business be-
yond its proper bounds; while so many other
branches of industry have been suffering from tbe
bank suspensions, and the artificial and political
panics and alarms with which the country has been
afflicted. Such an increase, under such ciicura-
stance , announces the existence of some secret
stimulus; and that stimulus is found in the vicious
legislation of Consrress in 1829 and 1833.
The increased exportation of refined sugars, and
the increased amount ot drawback upon them,
hive gone steadily forward, and with gigantic
«rides, since the compromise act ha« began to take
fuller effect. In five years—fr m 1835 to 1839 —
these annual increases are:

force.
Stronply as this table presents the question, there
is a still stronger view of it to be presented: it is
the table of the amounts of drawback paid on these
refined sugars for fifteen years, and by which it
will be seen ihat, previous to the erroneous legis-
lation of 1828, these drawbacks vibrated from
$1,600 to $5,800; that immediately upon the pas-
sage of that act they rose as high as $45,000 and
$84,000; and that oa the passage of the compro-
mise act in 1833, they took another rise, and have
run up to $251,301. Here is the table of theie
astonishing increases, the mere view of which an-
nounces the eiistence of great errors in our legis-
lation:

SHsh is the increase of the drawbacks on refined
sugars in the short sp.-ce of fifteen years; I may
say ten year} for the increase began with the er-
roneous law of 1829. The table proves the error;
but it is not the only proof to that effect. A letter
from the deputy co'lector of Philadelphia, Docu-
ment No 334, attests the fact, and that in relation
both to sugars and fish, he say*:
"Under the act of January '21,1959, the bounty, drawback, or
allowance, is at five cents per pound, and no more. As there
is no excise paid by the refiners, the allowance of five centa per
pound was, in 1829, considered as equivalent to the amount uf
duties paid on two pounds of brown sugar at 2J cents per
pound, the duty payable on the same at the time of passing the
act The duues now are teas by the excess under the art of
1832, and yet the drawback or bounty on the sugar is the same.
It is so with bounty on pickled fish of the fisheries of the United
States. When 20 cents per barrel was allowed, it was to
drawback the duty paid on a bushel of salt, supposed to be
used in curing a barrel of fish. Now the duty is less than 10
cents by the excess, yet the bounty remains at 30 cents, which
is for more than two bushels of a¿U."
He also says:
" The quantity of refined su ar exported in'1839, (last year,)
at ihis port, was 381,784 pounds, which, at 5 cents per pound,
made $19,239 20 as a drawback. This far excee s any amount
paid for many years. In looking over our accounts from 1834
to 1838. inclusive, the highest amount does not exceed «2,600—
say in 1836. 
And he says funher:
"I understand that large quantities of refined sugar will be ex-
ported from hence, and probably from other perts of the United
State*. I think the term sugar refined rather vague. Some of
the refiners are of opinion that all sugars melted and properly
clarified, and freed from all extraneous substances, may tie con-
sidered as refined—that bastard sugar is refined sugar. I must
confess that there is some plausibility in this, and it should be
guarded against by the Legislature; for, although the bastard
sugar is nothing more than the sugar-house white and brown
sugars, yet it has gone through the same operation as the loaf
and lump sugar, the only difference consisting in the last pro-
cess of claying^ but it is an inferior sugar—far inferior to a
good museavado in strength. I think the bounty, if allowed at
all, should be on rejinedloaf and lump tugar; and, if tho pri-
vilege of crushing the loaves or lumps is given, the crushing
should be done in the presence of an inspector. The object of
crushing can only be for the pupose of saving freight, to which
there might be no objection, if none under proper inspection."
Fmilly, he says:
"I will, however, recall to your recollection a circumstance
which occurred in this office. Mr. Canby invited you to call
at his establishment in Church alley, several years ago, to see his
process of refining, but refused to permit me to accompany you.
In the course of conversation, the question arose an lo the quan-
tity of raw sugar necessary to make one pound of refined
sugar. He stated that his brother thought that the bounty
should be on 2j pounds of raw, but his own opinion was ih¡u2J
pounds were ample; the duty then was 2| cents per pound,
while I thought ihat an average of 2 pounds would be enough."
Adding this testimony of the deputy collector to
the pregnant evidence of the tables, and the con-
clusion becomes irresistible, that enormous draw-
backs are unduly drawn from the Treasury—ihat
(hey are still increas'ng—that they are paid even
on bastard sugar—and ihat there must be an error
of half a pound of brown sugar in eveiy pound of
it refined.
Of (he $251 000 drawn from the Treasury last
year, I consider $150,000 to have been unduly and
unjustly drawn,   I do not say illegally, because
our miserable laws authorized it. I consider three-
fifths of the whole to be a naked gratuity—a mere
bounty—a simple present from our Treasury; and
I make up that sum thus: The act of 1829 added
one fifth to the drawback, which drawback was
suffic ent before: th s would give an error of
$50,000 in $250,000. The act of 1833 has nearly
reduced the duty on sugar one half, which should
have reduced the drawback also near one half: this
would take near $100,000 from the remaining
$200.000. This gives a total loss to the Treasury
in 1839 of near $150,000; a sum great in iiself,
but a mere trifle to what it is to be in 1841 and
1842, if the evil is not arrested. It is then that
the duties go down to twenty per centum on
the value, which will be little more than half
a cent a pound on brown sugar, while tbe draw-
back is to remain at five cents a poundl This
is a folly of which there is no example in the
annals of legislation. It may safely be asserted
that the legislative history of the world furn sbes
no instance ot such careless and ieckless and un-
just legislation. But bad as it is—gieat as the loss
tu ihe Treasury already is—yet we are only at the
beginning of it. The great harvest for the refiners
is still ahead—it is in the years 184 J and 1842—
when the compromise shall have reduced the su-
gar duty to half a cent, and left the drawback at
five cents. Then the harvest takes place; and
surely these two years will more than absorb the
whole sugar revenue, and exhibit the specacle of
seventeen millions of people taxed in an article of
universal consumption, in order to make a gracious
present—a gratuitous gift—of the whole amount of
the tax to some thirty-odd sugar refiners! Two
years of such work will be able to clear
princely fortunes; and it is highly probable
that the most reasonable of the refiners will
be willing for Congress to amend its law after
that time. The game will be in their own
hands; and two years of such work as they
can perform, ought to satisfy the most greedy and
voracious. A bounty, and a monopoly, at once in
thcr favor! Five cents drawback on refined su-
gar; less than one cent duty on brown sugar; the
treacle, syrup and sugar molasses all clear; a duty
on foreign refined sugar, which excluds it from our
market; the exclusive supply of the home market
at their own price; drawbacks all payable in thirty
days'in solid money; hundreds of millions of pounds
of brown sugar rapidly import! d, converted by
steam power into bastard or rtfined sugar, and ex-
ported at five cents a pound out of the Treasury:
such is the fruit of our legislation—such the pros-
pect before us—such the prize for which the re-
finers come here to contend—and snch ihe mis-
chiefs against which, solitary and alone, I raise my
feeble and unavailing voice.
Mr. B. said he could not take leave of this tope
of sugars, without noticing a paper which had
been communicated to the Senate, and printed by
i's order; it was a-letter from several sugar refiners
in Ihe city of New York, addressed to a member of
Ihis body, [Mr. Webster ] The letter selected an
expression from a former speet h of his—the cne he
made, on asking leave to bring in this bill—and
very clearly proved that expression tobe erroneous.
I then said the amount already paid to the sugar
refiners for their drawback exceeded the whole
amount of the sugar revenue, and that seventeen
millions of people were now taxed on their sugar to
turn over the whole amount of the proceeds of the
tax to a few d<zen supar refiners. This was am
error; but an cror in time only. Instead of now
receivirg the whole amount of the sugar revenue,
which they do not, the>e refiners will so receive it
about two years hence ! It is an error of two years;
an error which has no effect upon the character of
the bill, or the necessity of passing it. The truth is,
that the duty on sugar soing down—the exportation
of refined sugars enormously increas ng—and the
drawback remaining sta'ionary, the result is clear
that the drawback will exceed ihe revenue wlea
'he duty rea<h*s i's minimum in 1842. This is
e'ear; but whether the drawback should ever ex-
reed the duty, is perfectly immaterial to the ques-
tion of passing this bill. The amount of duty
which «hey have paid in, is all ihat the refiners
hare a right to draw back.   They have no right to
