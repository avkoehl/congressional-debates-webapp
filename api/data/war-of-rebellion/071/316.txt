HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,Poolesville, Md., July 14, 1864-7. 30 p. m.

Major General D. HUNTER:

GENERAL: I am at this point with a considerable force of old troops, having left Washington last evening. I am anxious to form a junction with you at the earliest possible moment, and have to request that you notify me of your position and contemplated movements in order that such junction may be effected at once. The enemy with his plunder crossed the Potomac yesterday and this morning at White's Ford, and my advance cavalry only encountered his rear guard of cavalry at this place. I have sent to General A. P. Howe, commanding at Harper's Ferry, intelligence of my movements with instructions to hold all available men ready for the field.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Commanding at Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: I am at this point with a considerable force of old troops, having left Washington last evening, and am anxious to form a junction with General Hunter and yourself. I inclose copy* of assignment by the President, and desire you to report by the courier who brings this the number of effective men you have for the field, leaving an adequate force for the garrison of Harper's Ferry. I have sent three messengers to try and communicate with General Hunter and ascertain his position and contemplated movements. The enemy with his plunder crossed the river place encountered all his rear guard of cavalry.
