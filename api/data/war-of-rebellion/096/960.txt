HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 13, 1865.

General STEVENSON,

Harper's Ferry:

Can you send word to Reno that a force of 500 cavalry goes to Berryville, and will move from there according to circumstances? If he could put a few trusty men at Rippon to give information to Berryville and Charlestown as the enemy approach (if they come) it would be a good plan. They would probably pass through Rippon. I referred to Fifth New York Heavy Artillery in my dispatch. Your report of February 28 shows seventeen officers out of forty-eight present and effective.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

SUMMIT POINT, March 13, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

Reliable information just received reports a force of rebels to have crossed the Shenandoah at Myerstown for the purpose of a raid.

E. P. DAVIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, March 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General SEWARD,

Martinsburg:

Dispatch received from headquarters advising me of a contemplated raid on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad via Smithfield. Have your command on the qui vive.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, March 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Will be on the lookout. Do you know the number of the raiding party? Duffield's and Brown's Cross-Roads are the weakest points.

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 13, 1865.

Brigadier-General FESSENDEN,

Commanding Post:

GENERAL: Major-General Hancock directs me to inform you that apparently reliable information is received that Mosby's party has just crossed the Shenandoah for the purpose of a raid. It is thought they will attempt to strike the railroad at some point, but possibly they may move in this direction, and the general desires you to be on the lookout.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
