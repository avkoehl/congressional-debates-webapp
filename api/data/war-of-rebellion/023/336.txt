HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 14, 1862.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

From a report of Colonel Miller it appears that Colonel Boone and his staff officers and only about 125 officers and men were captured at Gallatin. The rest were on detached service. The captains were released on parole and were making their way toward Bowling Green.

It is my order that you arrest Colonel Boone and every officer and soldier captured at Gallatin. Ascertain the names of the guards and sentinels, and report the whole to these headquarters. Take prompt and energetic measures to save the railroad and intercept the enemy. Put your old force into activity for that purpose. The troops sent you from Ohio and Indiana concentrate at Lexington and Bardstown, and use as occasion may require.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 14, 1862.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

The troops I proposed you should place at Bardstown were expected to serve as a reserve, while your older troops were organized into an active force for sudden emergencies. Lebanon will perhaps do as well as Bardstown. It ought to be at some point where you can transport it by railroad if possible. If you station cavalry on this side of the Cumberland it ought to act in conjunction with the troops in Tennessee and be within supporting distance of them. How much artillery have you?

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 14, 1862.

Colonel BRUCE, Bowling Green:

D. C. BUELL.

Commander-in-Chief U. S. Army:

A man from Pike County, Kentucky, reports Marshall and Williams entering with 2,000 men into Northeastern Kentucky. If Governor Tod would send any troops, with the force I have I can whip back the
