Brattleborough, Vt., February 13, 1864.

Colonel FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.

SIR: The appended slip, a proclamation of Governor Gilmore, of New Hampshire, was forwarded to me by General Washburn, adjutant- general of Vermont. Does not His Excellency misapprehend your telegrams? If he is correct, we will have but few men to raise here. This proclamation is having a very bad effect in this State, as town meetings were being called in the northern part of the State with a view of offering town bounties, but this proclamation has stopped them. The Vermonters think that if New Hampshire is clear of the draft, they are.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. G. PITCHER,

Brigadier-General, Actg. Asst. Prov. March General.
