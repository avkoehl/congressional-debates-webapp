Colonel C. GODDARD,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Cumberland:

The rebels have repaid their pontoon-bridge on the river side preparatory to swinging it across. Their camp appears to be much increased since yesterday morning. They have reliable news of our force on this side, and appear to be concentrating either at Chattanooga or for a movement farther south. General Wagner coincides with me in this. A deserter crossed the river here last night, corroborating this.

I am, sir, very truly, your obedient servant,

J. T. WILDER,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-General Hazen's battery threw a few shots at the rebels at Friar's Island this morning, to which they responded.

Heard five reports of artillery on right of us at 5 a.m. My men report the enemy constructing works on the bank of the river, south and adjoining battery.
