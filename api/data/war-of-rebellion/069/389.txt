Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My skirmishers have crossed the road at Bethesda Church and met with a little opposition in the vicinity of the road. The left extends nearly a mile southeast of the road, finding nothing. The map of the road from Linney's to Bethesda Church and on to Mechanicsville, you know, is correct.
