come over and see you, but cannot. I sent an order to you,

directing you to send out a sufficient force in the direction of Little Washington, to ascertain by observation, if any indication of a movement, which way it is, whether up toward the Valley or back, as it may be possible they had sent some force off and are bringing it back.

Yours, &amp;c.,

JOHN. F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding First Corps.

General PLEASONTON:

My command now hold fords to Beverly, and I depend on you for my right flank. The cavalry pickets on my right strike me as very thin. Enemy's trains seem to be in motion toward the right. I should have a squadron of cavalry as patrol; try and spare it.
