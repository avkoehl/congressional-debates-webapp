SEPTEMBER 2, 1862.-Skirmish near Leesburg, Va.

Report of Colonel Dixon S. Miles.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA.,

September 2, 1862.

Captain Cole has just arrived. Reports he was attacked by at least 800 cavalry on the road to Point of Rocks. He fought the force in front and drove them, when another party attacked him in the rear. Captain Means and his company broke and ran. Means, he things, escaped to the mountains. Cole had about 150 men; so far as he knows about 60 escaped and have come in; 6 of them badly wounded. Colonel Taskins [?], at Point of Rocks, telegraphs they are still coming in. Captain Hunter, Lieutenants Milling and Gallagher are missing. A prisoner and citizens informed Cole, at Leesburg, that Jackson was outflanking Pope and his army, not over 7 miles from Leesburg, to the left of Gum Spring. The enemy is in my neighborhood in some force, exhibiting signals on Loudoun Mountain. If Winchester is abandoned, I should draw in my force on railroad. Please give orders.

D. S. MILES,

Second Infantry.

Major-General HALLECK.
