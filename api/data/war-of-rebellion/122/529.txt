Have forwarded four regiments to Louisville, Ky., to the relief o Anderson, at his urgent request. Is it not possible to send arms to this State? I am ashamed to mention it again, but the necessity is my apology. The arms we have bought have not arrived.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that in accordance with your authority I have enrolled two companies of cavalry for service on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but these will not be sufficient for our purposes down on the lower portion of the shore, where cavalry will not only be useful but absolutely necessary. I therefore beg leave to offer two additional companies, which with your permission I will proceed to have mustered into service as soon as possible.

Your obedient servant,

W. H. PURNELL.
