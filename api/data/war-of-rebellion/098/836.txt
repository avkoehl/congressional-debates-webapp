direction about five miles, it was divided and the Twentieth Connecticut, Thirty-third Massachusetts, and One hundred and second Illinois Regiments Volunteer Infantry placed under my command, and I was directed to proceed on the road north as far as Taylor's Hole Run, unless the enemy should be found in force strong enough to prevent it. I was also directed by the brigadier-general commanding, if the enemy was found, to use only skirmishers and not to attack in line of battle. In accordance with orders I moved forward with my command, and after advancing about three miles, found a small body of the enemy posted on the road in my front, near a mill, with an extensive pond and marsh covering his left flank, a deep creek in his front, and the bridge destroyed over it. While making disposition to attack him the enemy withdrew, and after rebuilding the bridge I moved on, sending four companies, under the charge of Captain Billings, Company D, Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers, forward as an advance guard, with orders to deploy skirmishers across the road and move cautiously forward in that manner. About a mile beyond the mill we again found the enemy behind temporary works of rails thrown up across the road, but after exchanging a few shots with my skirmishers he again fell back to within about a mile of Silver Run, where he again made a stand, showing an additional force of cavalry, and brought up a piece of artillery, firing several shots quite rapidly at my advance guard, but without effect. I here directed my advance to halt and brought up my main force on the right of the road in the woods, under cover, to within easy supporting distance; moved the One hundred and second Illinois Volunteers to the left across the road, as if making disposition to attack in force, and then ordered the skirmishers to advance, which was done in good order.

After quite a spirited skirmish the enemy was driven back to the cross-roads to within a quarter of a mile of Silver Run. Here, finding the force of the enemy had been increased and that he was making quite a determined stand, I sent forward four companies from the one hundred and second Illinois Volunteers to re-enforce and extend my line of skirmishers, at the same time sending one company from the Thirty-third Massachusetts Volunteers out toward the left and rear of my skirmish line to guard a road which led from my left toward the right of the enemy, so as to prevent a flank attack in that direction. After these dispositions were made I ordered an advance, and the enemy was soon driven back across Silver Run Creek and took refuge behind earth-works, in which I discovered artillery in position and a force sufficient to occupy works a mile or more in extent. I moved forward my main force under cover to within supporting distance of my skirmish line and then directed the reserve in rear of the skirmishers to move to my right, extend the line, and then swing forward so as to obtain a flank fire upon the line of the enemy; but I found he had a sufficient force to hold his works in our front, and at the same time resist my demonstration on his left with a superior force. After skirmishing with him quite briskly for nearly two hours, and finding I could not dislodge him without using my whole force, and that I had not more than time to reach camp by a seasonable hour, I withdrew my force in good order and, unmolested by the enemy, marched back to camp, which I reached about 9 p. m., having marched in all about twenty miles, skirmished with the enemy about three hours, and driven him nearly four miles into a strongly intrenched position.

Much credit is due to the commanding officers of the regiments composing my command, and to the officers and men generally, for the cheer-
