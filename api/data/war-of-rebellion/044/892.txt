NEW YORK, July 17, 1863. (Received 2. 07 p. m.)

SIR: Police Commissioner [Thomas C.] Acton reports that in a fight last night near Gramercy Park, the soldiers got the worst of it, and were driven back, leaving one of their number killed. Captain Putnam, of the regulars, started with two companies, and thoroughly routed the rioters, killing from 15 to 25, taking 16 prisoners, and bringing off the body of the sergeant, which was left at the first fight. Police Commissioner Acton desires to make a special request for the promotion of Captain Putnam, Company F, Twelfth U. S. Infantry, this being the second time that he has encountered and overcome the rioters after they had gotten the better of our troops under other officers. No disturbance has occurred this morning in any part of the city.

Respectfully,
