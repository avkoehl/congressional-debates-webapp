Brigadier General S. M. BARTON,

At or near Bean's Station, Tenn.:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the commanding general to say that he has given General Stevenson orders, to hold Clinch Mountain and Bean's Station, placing your command at Blain's Cross-Roads, with directions to watch the roads coming in at that point and the Powder Spring Gap.

The following information in regard to roads and distances in that vicinity is considered reliable by the commanding general:

From Bean's Station to Rutledge is 9 miles, at which point a road comes in across the mountains; this is an indifferent one and stated to be hardly practicable now (if at all so) for artillery. Ten miles farther on or 19 miles from Bean's Station, is Powder Spring Gap, through which is another and practicable road. Five miles from Powder Spring Gap, or 24 from Bean's Cross-Roads, where the main body of your command should be placed.

Major Harper's ;command has been ordered to Maynardville, at or near which point supplies have been placed. The commanding general directs that you report to him upon your arrival at Blain's Cross-Roads and keep him apprised of everything important which transpires.

You obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON.
