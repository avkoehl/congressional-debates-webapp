Say 150 wagons for the ammunition train, which I wish made up as follows:

1. The 119 wagons for the general reserve of 20 rounds, and spare fuses and powder.

2. Seventy-nine wagons for reserve of guns in Artillery Reserve. Twenty-two, distribute for forage and mess wagons, so that nothing whatever shall be carried in the ammunition wagons but the ammunition. Every wagon-master or teamster violating this order to be punished and reported for discharge. Artillery wagons sent with the guns from the reserve to the corps to be deducted from the above allowance for the Reserve Artillery, not general trains.

If the 20 wagons spoken of by Colonel Morford are not included in the 254, you have your full supply. If they are, the 17 can be drawn. general Ingalls states that the addition of 1 wagons per battery will be extended to the reserve.

Brigadier-General CULLUM, Chief of Staff:

I have nothing reliable in regard to the movement of the enemy along the line of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. I had hoped here this to have been able to have sent an expedition, via Lewisburg, in Greenbrier County, through Union, in Monroe County, and
