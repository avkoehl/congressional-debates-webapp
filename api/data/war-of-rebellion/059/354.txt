Colonel RICHARD ROWETT,

Commanding Seventh, Illinois Infantry:

Reports are coming in daily of small parties of the enemy in different sections of the country, well armed and equipped. You will keep a sharp lookout for all such detached and broken forces and cut off and capture them whenever it may be possible, as they will doubtless annoy us very if left alone. They must be chased away at all events, and the fords so closely watched as to prevent their crossing or recrossing, if possible.

By order of Brigadier General T. W. Sweeny, commanding:

LOUIS H. EVERTS,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
