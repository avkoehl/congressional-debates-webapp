trim, New Hampshire, praying for the abolition
of siavety in the District
Mr P. said that the memorial came to him, ac-
companied by a letter fiom a highly respectable
clergyman, íesiding in his native county. The
letter says
" Though we are iwate that your view s may not corre
spond with those of tile petitioner", they have no doubt ot
your re idme«s to present a respectful petition, coming irotii
any portion of the citizens of New Ilamp^hue   '
It is certainly no task to present the memorial;
and yet I cannot, in justice to my own convic-

expressing my deep íegret that these petitioners,
many of whom I am sure are actuated by pure
motives, should so fai mistake their own moial
responsibilities, and the power and duty of Con-

I do earnestly hope that every honest man who
has sincerely at heait the best interests of the
slave and the master, may no longer be governed
by a blind zeal and impulse, but be led to examine
this subject, so full of delicacy and dangei, in all
its bearings, and that, when called upon to lend
their names and influence to the cause of agna-
tion, they may remembei that we live under a
wntten Constitution, which is the panoply and
protection of the South, as well as the North—
thatitcoveis the entire Union, and is equally a
guarantee for the unmolested enjoyment of the
domestic institutions of all its pai ts, and, I trust,
furthei, that they will no longer close then eyes
to the fact that, so far as those in whose welfaie
they express so much feeling are concerned, this
foreign mteijeience has been, and must inevitably
continue to be, evil, and only evil Having, on
a foimei occasion, expressed my views some-
what at length, I will not detain you furthei than
to notice an erroneous statement which has been
made, and a thousand times repeated, with íe-
gard to my own course and that of the íepie-
sentatives of New Hampshire in both Houses of
! Congress We have been charged with having
j denied the right of petition, and, although the
I charge is wholly without foundation, I have no
I doubt that, from its frequent repetition, it may
