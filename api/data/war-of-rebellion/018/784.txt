[AUGUST -, 1862.]

General POPE: The enemy demand that my skirmishers shall retire while the flag of truce is out or they will seize the ambulances.

I have halted, but they say we must retire. I shall remain here till further orders.

Yours,

GEO. D. BAYARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

REYNOLDS' DIVISION, [August -, 1862.]

Major-General POPE:

GENERAL: McDowell's corps is posted on Sudley Springs road, in rear of Henry house about one-half mile, awaiting orders.

General Reynolds has been absent from the division during the night and General Meade is in command.

C. KINGSBURY, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Reynolds' Division.

[AUGUST-, 1862.]

General McDOWELL:

But very few wagons, say 25, are just now in sight; but the enemy, I should judge about at least a brigade, has halted and built camp fires in front of the main road, about 2 miles from this hill. The enemy's pickets are stronger and plainer to be seen on the left than they were three hours ago.

THEO. MILLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. 1ST AND 2nd DIVISIONS, NINTH ARMY CORPS,[August -, 1862.]

General POPE:

GENERAL: General Buford sends me word that Generals Longstreet and Featherston are approaching with their whole divisions. A negro that was captured says they have about 40,000 men and ninety pieces of artillery. I have called back my reconnaissance, and will hold this place as long as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. RENO.

[AUGUST-, 1862.]

General McDOWELL:

SIR: I have advanced 1 1/2 miles in the road from where I first struck it. No enemy in sight. Am now where the two roads to Madison fork.

Respectfully, General Tower:

J. S. SLOSSON,

Captain, Aide-de-Camp.
