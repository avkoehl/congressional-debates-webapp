
upon a musket, and upon examination were found to have been pierced in fifty places.

It is with deep sorrow and profound regret that I have to report the death of First Lieutenant Napoleon D. Price, commanding Company D, who fell shot through the bowels while gallantly charging in advance of his company, calling on them to follow him. He was a generous, heightened, honorable, Christian gentleman, and I doubt not is now enjoying peace and heavenly rest.

All the officers of the regiment behaved with great gallantry, charging in every instance in advance of their respective commands. Such was the conduct of all the officers that I feel that it would be doing injustice to mention one above another, and I feel sure all they desire is the consciousness of having done their duty, which I man sure all should feel. Colonel Edmonds and Colonel Whittle may have some such to report. If so, they will attend to it at some future day.

The number reported among the non-commissioned officers and privates for individual gallantry is so large that I cannot give it with this. If, however, the general desires it I will have a list of their names made out and forwarded to him.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH R. CABELL,

Major, Commanding Thirty-eighth Virginia Regiment.

Captain, J. D. DARDEN,

A. A. A. G., Fourth Brigade, Hunger's Division.
