evidently of their won volition, though citizens participated with them. Certainly there is no testimony whatever showing that citizens incited them to violence. Sergeant Henderson further affirms that he does know of men belonging to his regiment who did participated in the riot by throwing stones, but declines at present to give their names. There is abundance of testimony going to show that a majority at least of the soldiers engaged in the affair of the Lindell Hotel belonged to the Sixth Missouri Cavalry. There were other soldiers there present mingled with them, but they constituted the main body. The public prints have given currency to the statement that the rioters were chiefly from the Tenth Kansas; but the testimony does not show this to be true. But three men of the Tenth Kansas were present.

Their affidavits* will be found with the inclosed documents. Attention is respectfully invited to the accompanying statement* of Private Harris, of Company B, Tenth Kansas, who affirms that he was standing among the soldiers opposite the Lindell Hotel, and that the first stones cast came from the crowd which hurrahed for McClellan. This statement is corroborated by that of Lieutenant F. W. Becker, who is on duty with the chief of ordnance of the Department of the Missouri. Though this is doubtless true, yet it is equally true that the soldiers standing thereabouts had stones in their hands before this, evidently awaiting a favorable moment in which to throw them. It has been alleged that soldiers of the Tenth Kansas openly and defiantly carried the flags taken from the speaker's stand to their own quarters. The flags were so taken, but by members of the guard who had rescued them from the rioters under the direction of Lieutenant Thorpe and Captain Hills. These flags have since been returned to the committee. It has been charged that an officer of the army was personally engaged in the emeute, aiding and inciting the soldiers. Lieutenant F. W. Becker, assistant to the chief of ordnance, has been designated as the officer. His statement* is herewith inclosed. Until successfully contradicted it is entitled to credence. He has been confronted with Messrs. Creveling and Marsh, citizens, who thought they could recognize the officer, but failed to identify him as the one. After the main difficulty at the front of the Lindell Hotel another occurred within their building, in which Captain J. M. Adams, of the First Missouri Cavalry, temporarily here under orders from Major-General Steele, was the principal character. His statement,* supported by that of Mr. N. H. Clark, a well-known citizen, is herewith submitted. He was evidently more "sinned against than sinning," and may rejoice at his narrow escape. From the great mass of testimony taken from men who were upon the ground, it is extraordinary that the guilty parties cannot be identified. It can only be accounted for on the supposition before stated that soldiers make it a point of honor to shield each other in matters of this kind. It is evident that Sergeant Henderson knows sufficient to give a clew to the whole affair. But in what manner he is to be compelled to give the information is for my superior officers to direct. The major-general commanding may rest assured that the most diligent and persistent efforts have been made to ascertain the guilty, over ninety men having been arrested and examined and every clue faithfully followed. I desire here to remark that the evidence clearly shows that citizens as well as soldiers participated in the outrages. So far as the throwing of stones was concerned there were evidently as many citizens so engaged as soldiers. The number of soldiers actually taking part as stated in the
