I regret to inform you that I have none. But it will be satisfactory for you to know that there are now two gun-boats at Gunpowder bridge and one at Bush River bridge, besides one at Havre de Grace; they were seen thus posted this morning by a naval officer who reached here to-day.

Very respectfully,

THOS. A. DORNIN,

Commodore.
