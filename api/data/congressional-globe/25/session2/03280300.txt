CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jackson. Accoidtngly, he went to work upon this
list, instead of that which had been transmitted to
him by the Secretary of State, and furnished for
mal answers m some ten or fifteen of the cases, in
a majority of which no demand had been made by
Mi. Forsyth upon the Mexican Government Of
course, these answers w ere triumphant m such cases
as had been abandoned by our own Government
[Mr Clay here observed that some of the claims
had been admitted.]
Mr B resumed. In one or two of the other
cases presented in the official list, the justice of the
claims was admitted, but no rational prospect of
payment was presented At the rate of progres-
sion with which the Mexican Secretary had hitherto
proceeded, it would be year  before he could go
through this old printed list, and from anj thing
which appeared, the claimants would be as far
from obtaining actual indemnification at the end of
this process as they were in the beginning
He would be as far from censuring the Commit-
tee Qn Foreign Relations of the House for remiss-
ness, as he was confident they were from deserving
it. They best knew when and how to act tor
themselves. He had no desire to hurry their ac-
tion, or interfere with it in any mannei He hal
no doubt they would do their duty If the Senator
from Mississippi [Mr Walker] still lemamed un-
satisfied with our conduct, let him introduce a reso-
lution instructing the Committee on Toreigii Rela
tions to act promptly and report a war measure
From the spirit he had evinced,he apDears anxious
to go to war at once For his own part, Mr B
said, he had no disposition to act in so hasty a man-
ner If he moved slowly towards his object, he
trusted he should move surely
Mr PRESTON, after making some remark"; on
the strong measures recommended by the Executive
in relation to the affairs with Mexico, was glad that
the Committee on Foreign Relations hid not
responded to the bellgerent featuies recommended
in the communication to Congieas, for so long as
there was ihe slightest hope that we could have our
claims on that power settled without proceeding to
ulterior means, he was willing to wait Wai wis
always to be avoided, if possible, and, most oí all
was it incumbent on us not to engage in it (rom pe-
cuniary or sordid motives, so long as there existed
the slightest chance of a proper settlement without
it But with regard to the insult ((fined u cui
flag, that was anotlur mattei If the facts weie
as stated by gentlemen, why had they not been
commun cated by tie Executive? Lither the re-
presentat ons weic exaggerated In rumor, or the
Executive had failul to do his duty II, ho«
ever, it was true that our 11 ig had bepn insulted
m our own sea, (the Gull of Mexico) man
nostrum, as the Romans said of their own Medí
terranean, he wou'd be as íeady and willing as
any man to preserve unsullied that flag and
whether the insult was offered by a proud and
haughty nation, or from a weak and impotent
power, like that of Mexico, it should not pass
with impuniiv
Mr BENTON said that the question is to how
the debate originated, was easily answered It
commenced with an inquiry \ery prepeiy mide
by the Senator from Mississippi ot th„ ehairm in
ot the Committee on Foreign Relation's wh ch led
to an explanation which all heard He was one
of those who saw and read in the New Orleans
papers, the statement mide by the passengers m
the steamboat Columbia That vessel was brought
toby two Mexican vessels of war, fired into, and
compelled to he to, till by the noise occasioned by
the engineer letting off Ins steam, the Mexicans
were frightened away, and the steamboat escaped
We see in this, sa d Mr L that the flag of the
United States was no protection to its citizens It
was the escape pipe letting off the sieam t lat
saved the passengers, and not the flag of tre Uni-
ted States Since then, he had read in the New
Orleans papers 'lut the passengers in the same
steamboat about tailing from New Oneans,
placing no íeliance on the flag of the United States,
had armed themselves, as if agí nst p rates, -ml it
was further stated jn the same papers, that when
the vessel left the wharf, a vast number of pcison 
crowded down to take leave of their friends going
m a peulous enterprise Now the point he wished
to call the attention of the Senate to, was that the
flag of the United States, m our own sea, mmc
nostrtm, was no piotection to the American citizen
—he must trust to his arms With respect to that
rashness and precipation, ill temper and want
of dignity, with which this Government was
charged by the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr.
Ciay,] for bieakmg of? the negotiations to obtain
redress foi our injuries inflicted by Mexico, it was
w ithin his knowledge, and not from any informa-
tion derived from Mexico, that the charge had no
foundation One of the cases was derived from
Missouri Tno of its citizens, Julius De Mun,
and Auguste Choteau, engaged in trade on the Ar-
kansas; n\ er, under the license of the Governor of
Missouri, and with a capital of $30,000, trading
with our own Indians, and in our own territory,
these citizens were seized upon bj 200 Mexican
dragoons from Panta Fe, one of them compelled to
go up and down the river, under an escon of Mexi
can dtagoons, to show a fort that they alleged was
building to gimson 20,000 men for the purpose of
invading Mexico, and when he could show no fori,
he and his companion were carried to Santa Fe
and thrown into a dungeon for firty days This
was not all They weie brought to tual, and De
Mun, understanding the Spanish language, repeat-
edly heard the Governoi say to Ins officers, "thew
men must be shot " But they were not shot, though
their property, ¿30,000 worth, was taken from
them, and they, with their followers, fony tn num-
ber, without arms, and without subsistence of any
kind, were turned loosp to make their way back,
900 miles, through a wilderness infected b> tribes
of savages of the w orst desci iption They arnvd
safe at St Louis, and, immediately on their arm al,
made known their grievances to our Government,
and from that day to this they have not recen cd
one particle of redress AH this took place twenty
years ago, and although the claim'' of these mjuicd
citi/ens have been frequently pressed upon the
Mexican Government, supported by the most in-
dubitable testimony, they have not íeceived íemu-
neiation for then property to the value of one cent
After all this, said Mr B we are told of precipita-
tion, and the Administration is to be accused of
rashness for breaking ofi the negotiation*, when
every man believe0 that if we ware to negotiate till
doomsday we should be as far off from redress as
evei No, sir, --aid Mr B our citi/ens ha e been
plundered, our coil invaded, and our flag in ulted,
and we have not received, noi aie we II pit to re-
ce vc, from that Government, one word of apology
or atonement
Mr KING thought the dt bate exceedingly ill
timed, and he regretted ihe mannei in which it had
been brought up Being a member e f ihe comm t-
tee, he had concu red with them that utuh r all the
circumstances of the ca e, it would be better for
the Senate to «ait for the action of the House of
Representatives, and he still cntprtamrd that opi-
n on He was a httl snipnsed at the rem irks rf
the Senator fr< i K< ntueky, censuring the Admi
nistiation as having acted lashly and with prooipi
tation in teimimling the negotiation where they did
Suely no one would look into the document'  com-
municated by the Go/emment, without seeing that
the greatest forbearance had been exercised fot
tears towards Mexico, and that this Government
had acted towards thit power with a leniency that
it would not have shown to the most powerful
Government of I urope, in f ict, that it had for-
borne till forbearance ceased tobe a vutue Afur
all this, they w ere now told by the Senator from
Kentucky that the President had acted with unne
cessary heat and precipitation in suspending all
ftuther demands for redress, and submitting the
whole affair to the action of Congress The Ad-
ministration, said Mr K was very tin ortunately
situated The Senator from South Caro'ma com-
plained that the Presi lent had been remiss in his
duty in not co nmumcatmg the fact of the late out
rage on the itcmboit Columbia to Ccngress, while
thn Senatoi from lOntu ky on the (ther han I,
charged the Goverimpnt with being too rash "nl
pr eipitate Why, s r, the information as to the
outrage on the f olumbia had been receivfd here
only two or three days past,  and that, too,  by a
slip cut from a New Orleans paper and forwarded
by the Express mail, and there was no reason to
believe that the Government had as yet received
any authentic or official account of the affair,
though there was no doubt as to the truth of the
circumstances connected with it He himself knew
the names of several of the persons signed to the f
statement m the newspapers, and he would take
the occasion to say that they were gentlemen of
respectability and veracity Bat would the Sena-
lor from South Carolina have the President make a
newspaper statement the subject of a grave com-
munication to Congress? This would, indeed, be
acting with a degree of rasnness and precipitation,
of which the Senator from Kentucky would well
have a light to complain.
He was fully aware that his friend from Missis-
sippi had strong feelings on the subject He knew
his high and chivalrous devotion to the honor of
his country But while he was so regardful of the
honor and interests of his own country, would he
incur the nsk of violating the rights of others' Let
him, Mi K said, wait a reasonable time, and if
atonement is not made, then let him recommend
the course of action which honor requires The
course of the Mexican Government could be de-
fended by no one Still it was not necessary for
the Senate to be hurried into any hasty action with
regard to her Bat when the time arrived when 11
should become necessary to act, he for one would be
prepared togoanylengthsnscessaiy tojvindicate our
nationalhonor, and protect our citizens from outrage
o* injury He knew (hat many of the cases of
complaint against Mexico would not bear scrutiny,
and this was the case of the one brought up by his
friend from Missouri, [Mr Bínton,] for the inju-
ry there complained of was not committed under
the present Government of Mexico, but by the offi-
cei s of Spam
That, however, was not now the question.
All that he lose to say was to rescue the Govern-
ment of the United Stales from ihe charges of the
Senator from Kentucky, and to maintain that it
had manifested the gre ile^t forbearance and con-
ciliation towards a Government that had been for
yfiit insulting our flag, and j>lundering our citi-
zens, and ev ading, by the most flimsy pretexts, our
demands tor redress The Senator from Kentucky
asks, why is not our Minister to Mexico at his
post? The Senator knew, or should know, that
the state of things had not arisen under which the
Minister, appointed during the last session, was to
go to Mexico For what purpose make it a cause
of complaint? Mr Ellis was nominated for that
mission when u wasltnown that all diplomatic m-
leicoursewith Mexico had terminated, and would
not be resumed until a favorable answei should be
returned to the final demand for redress, about to
be sent by a special messenger Our Minister had
withdrawn from that country, and their Minister
had left here, scattering his calumnies behind him
In this state of things the President, in a spirit of
conciliation highly ctediiable to him, nominated
Mr Filis as Minister to Mexico, in the following
woids, "to be sent whenever circurrstaiiees will
peimit a renewal of diplomatic inteicourse hono-
rably with that power" Would t, he would ask
o( the Senator from Kentucky, be consistent with
our high sense of honor to serd a Minister to that
Republic while eur final and solemn appeal to
them for justice was unanswered? He knew that
'he Senator from Kentucky w ould not be of opi-
nion that we should send a Mmiser there while
Ihe Outrages ^nd injurips of which we have so often
complained, remained unatoned for He had no
intention in rising (said Mi K) to protract this
unnecessary d ba e All ne lose for was, first to
vmlicate the Administration from the charge of
precipi'arcy and want of foibearance, secondly,
lor net having communicated the circumstances of
the late oujrage to Congrev-i, and lastly, to explain
«hy it woi (1 hot be proper for oc,r Minister to go
to Mexico in the present state of eur affairs with
that countrj.
Mr CLAY still maintained that there had been
i piecipitanej shivn in the matter, unbecoming
the Exei utive of a great nation Many of the
claims set up against Mexico were not based on
justice, a-nd, as such, were rejected     Of this cha-
