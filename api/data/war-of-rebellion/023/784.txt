SIR: It is possible that General Breckinridge's division will be sent up to Knoxville, thence to re-enforce this army. General Smith directs that you keep yourself advised by telegraph of General Breckinridge's progress, and use every exertion in preparing the necessary transportation and supplies to expedite his arrival at these headquarters and forward with him every disposable man you can.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUGUST 27, 1862.

Captain [W. H.] McMAIN:

You will take measures to establish a depot of ordnance and ordnance stores at Dalton, Ga., where will be deposited those required for the army. You may make arrangements with company for part of railroad depot, as mentioned in your letter, by paying monthly rent if required. The general commanding wishes never to force or seize any private property unless in most urgent cases. I will advise Captain [M. H.] Wright, at Atlanta, to send the supplies to you, and you will please to make requisition on him whenever there will be any necessity for new supplies. I wish you to advise me from time to time of any change. The adjutant-general's office will remain at Chattanooga. We are going to-night, so you will not hear from me for some time. I send you Anderson and other men, whom you will retain at your post. Mr. Cammack is a clerk, and can be retained in office until I will require him. Take care of my things. I have some papers which should not be lost.

Respectfully,

H. OLADOWSKI.

P. S.-Advise Captain W. D. Humphries what kind and quantity of stores you may have and receive at your depot, that he may draw them as required.
