First Lieutenant, Ninth Infantry, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HUMBOLDT MILITARY DISTRICT,Fort Humboldt, July 17, 1862.

Captain H. FLYNN,

Second Infantry California Volunteers, Fort Lyon:

CAPTAIN: Yesterday Lieutenant Staples' scouting party of four Indians and one squaw, sent from this post, encountered a band of forty or fifty well armed Indians about three miles from Reed's in the direction of the Iaqua Ranch. The squaw they carried off. The four bucks escaped, though fired upon, and long before this Lieutenant Staples is no doubt after them with his small detachment at Eel River House. The colonel commanding desires you immediately on the receipt of this to take or send as many men as you can spare directly to Iaqua Ranch, and from thence by the shortest route straight through to Reed's, where you will probably get further information as to the course they have taken, which is supposed to be toward Hydesville. You are at liberty to take any other route, if the information you may obtain should make it advisable.

By order of Colonel Lippitt.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN HANNA, JR.,

First Lieutenant and Adjutant Second Infantry California Vols.,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Humboldt Military District.
