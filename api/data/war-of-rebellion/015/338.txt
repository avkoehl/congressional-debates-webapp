I hasten to make a correction. Investigation this day has satisfied me that the Pennsylvania regiments behaved as bravely as any on the field. Through the eyes of others I was momentarily misled by misstatements. It affords me infinite gratification to be able to correct them, and to do full justice to a body of brave troops who have suffered dreadfully. You will please expunge that portion of my communication which makes them an exception, as I do in a copy I retain.

Dispatch this moment from General Banks. He pursued the enemy as far as Woodstock. He thinks they are uniting Jackson's and Longstreet's forces at Luray and Washington, for operations on this side of mountains. Our advance has taken strong position 4 miles beyond Strasburg. Rest of my division occupies strong position near Strasburg. Two brigades (Williams') are 2 miles from Strasburg toward Front Royal. Telegraph line will be completed to Strasburg, to-morrow. Can we get any information of General Rosecrans' position or movements?

Our victory at Winchester has been more fatal to the rebels than at first supposed. It has struck the Shenandoah Valley with terror. Union prisoners escaped from Mount Jackson prison just arrived. Saw eight wagons loaded with dead and wounded enter Mount Jackson on Monday, 10 p.m., 44 miles from the field of battle, in thirty hours. The rebels admitted they had 11,000 in the field; also that they lost between 1,000 and 1,500 in killed and wounded. We are finding their graves some distance from each side of the road. The blow has struck terror to this country.

HEADQUARTERS SHIELDS' DIVISION, Winchester, Va., March 29, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report that during my reconnaissance of the 18th and 19th instant in the direction of Mount Jackson I ascertained that the enemy under Jackson was strongly posted near that place, and in direct communication with a force at Luray and another at Washington. It became important, therefore, to draw him from his
