LA GRANGE, January 3, 1863.

General GRANT:

Is it not probable that Van Dorn is preparing to go to Forrest's aid rather than to make another attack on the railroad? There is no point now where he can cross Wolf River. If he goes to Forrest he must go by Chewalla, and Dodge may head him on the Tuscumbia.

HAMILTON.

HOLLY SPRINGS, January 3, 1863.

General DODGE:

The enemy's cavalry and mounted infantry have been crossing at Pontotoc with design no doubt of getting into our rear or possibly to re-enforce Forrest. Keep a sharp lookout for him and don't let him get across the Tuscumbia if it can be helped.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
