HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 1, 1865-11 p. m.

General D. H. MAURY,

Mobile, Ala.:

I felt it to be my duty to call my brigade commanders to a council of war and to ask their opinion as to the possibility of holding this position after the withdrawal of Ector's brigade. Colonel Campbell, Colonel Jones, Colonel Patton, and General Holtzclaw are present. They have expressed their opinions, beginning with the junior officer, in view of the present aspect of affairs here, that the position cannot be held with the reduced force, and that the troops, guns, and stores will fall into the hands of the enemy should he attack. I fully concur in this opinion. Let me assure you of one thing, whatever force is left here shall make a defense that will reflect no discredit upon our army. Every officer and man will do his whole duty.

General GIBSON,

Spanish Fort:

I regret very much the withdrawal of such a number of troops from your command, but greater credit will be due General Holtzclaw and yourself by holding out gallantry with your small force, and no one will more readily accord this credit to you, General Holtzclaw, and your garrison than myself.

ST. JNO. R. LIDDELL,

General HOLTZCLAW,

Spanish Fort:

The order to withdraw troops emanates from General Maury, not myself. I have no desire to withdraw the troops. I have referred the matter to General Maury again.

General D. H. MAURY:

General Liddell telegraphs General Holtzclaw that the regrets the withdrawal of troops from this position, and that he has desire to do so. Please answer if you have received my three telegrams relative to this matter. Answer my dispatches.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.
