Dxtlrict Banks—Mr. Vanderpoeh
H. of Repg.
If one hundred Minare miles requires six banks,
what will one million square milts require?
I think the answer will be 60,000.
Yes, sir, the Whigs would establish 60,000 banks
in this country.
How much bank capital? That can be tried by
the «ame rule.
If forty thousand people (the population of the
District of Columbia) require three millions of
bank capital (the amount in the Distric of Colum-
bia,) what amount of bank capital will fifteen mil-
lions of people (the amount of population of the
United Sute*) require?
The answer will be $1,135,000,000.
Yes, sir; by the Whig policy we would have
eleven hundred and twenty-five millions of bank
capital in this country. But how much paper cur-
rency would we have? Why. of course tSree.
times the areoun* of bank capital: that would be
fS.375,000,000. Yes, sir, the amount of rag cur-
rency we would have in the United States and the
Territories thereof would be three billions three
handled and seventy-five millions. What a happy
people we would be under Whig bank reign' How
rich, too, we would be!
Let us see what our annual income would be at
six per cent, on the whole amount of currency.
The answer is, #202,500,000.
Yes, sir, our annual income would be two hun-
dred and two millions five hundred thousand dol-
lars. What a rich people we would be! Who
would be such a fool or an ass as to work or toil in
this country? What glorious times we will have
when this thick-headed, stupid Administration is
put down, and Whig Bank Federalism comes into
power! And strange as it may appear, we would
accumulate this vast wealth of! of each other. I
once heard of a celebrated gambler who taught his
four sons the art of gambling so adroitly that they
could each make off of each other ten dollars every
night. I thought that was a v range kind of leger-
demain. That man and his sons were fools, when
compared with the Bank Whig  of this day: our
gamblers could give them six in the game, and beat
them in "seven up."
The Carihagenians were a trading people. They
lived by trading. They became a wealthy nation
and a rich people; but it was not by trading and
speculating off of each other. Their wealth was
acquired by commercial trade. By their superi-
oii>y in commerce, the wealth of all nations fl >wed
into their coffers. But the policy of our bank Whigs
has the superiority of dispensing wealth and afflu-
ence among 'hose from whom it is collected.
I deny the second proposition of the gentleman
from Georgia, v z: "The whole population of ihe
District of Columbia are praying for a renewal of
the bank charters," «fee. What evidence have we
that the people want the banks continued at all? A
petition has been paraded here wi.h two hundred
and forty-four names, all told, who a*k for a con-
tinuation of. the bank charter*. We have a right
to presume that all the rest of the citizens are either
indifferent or are opposed to the recharter.
We have been told, if we don't recharter the
District banks, we will destroy the people of the
adjoining counties in Virginia and Maryland.
That is no argument at all. We have nothing to
do with the people or their cirenmstances of Virgi-
nia and Maryland when we are kg ¡slating for toe
District of Columbia. The people of Virginia and
Maryland have Legislatures of their own perfectly
competent to legislate for them. And besides, we
have no power to establish banks in the District of
Columbia for the people of Virginia or Maryland,
or of any other State. Oar powers of incorpora-
tion are limited to this District, and for the benefit
of the people of the District; and even that power
is seriously dif puled by many eminent and talented
statesmen.
It has been said, in opposition to the amendment
to require the banks to resume specie payment,
that they ought not to be compellel to resume un-
til the banks of Virginia and Maryland resume. If
that argument is good, the banks in this country
never will resume-
When the banks of Virginia and Maryland ap-
ply for recharter when under suspension of spec e
payment, it will be urged that the resumption of
payment oug'it not to be made a condition of their
recharter, because the banks of the District of Co-
lumbia are not paying specie. So with the banks
of Pennsylvania; when they apply for recharter,
resumption with them ought not to be a condition,
because the banks of Virginia and Maryland are
under suspen-ion; and so it will so throughout the
twenty-six States, and the Territories will also
catch the miserable excuse to perpetuate their
miserable frauds. Such an argument is "felo it
st;" it destroys itself. Such an argument is worthy
of the corrupt and fraudulent institutions which it
is used to support. They and the argument are
alike rotten—both will tumble together.
The member from Maryland [Mr. Jenifer] de-
nounces the ungenerous course pursued toward
the unfortunate people of the District, who have
no Representative on this floor. The fact that they
have no immediate Representative here, is a strong
argument in favor of a liberal course on the
part of Congress toward them. Now, sir, let us
examine the records, and see what Congress has
done for "this poor, neglected, and unfortunate
people!" In order to measure my duty toward
the District of Columbia, and to be able to judge
more correctly how far I might be at liberty to ap-
propriate the proceeds of my constituents' toil and
sweat to the people of this District, on whom Con-
gress is bound to bestow nothing more than upon
any other district, county, or State in the Union,
nor are they at liberty to do so; I say, in order to
measure my duty, I gave my attention to the col-
lection of some figures and facts. I like figuren and
facts; they look a man in the face; but, what is
better, the people understand them; schoolboys can
read them to their parents on a rainy day, or in a
long night, by the light of the shellbark. So, sir,
I found the following:

Tha principal of the canal loans is included in the above,
amounting to «1,600,000, which has not yet bean paid.
Yes, sir, three millions two hunired and three
thousand and sixty-one dollars and thirty-nine cent*
has been drawn from the publie crib, and bren
given to the "poor, abused, and neglected people"
of the District of Columbia, over whose misfor-
tunes we have heard such piteous ho wlins; and be it
remembered, too, that the above appropriations bare
been made for the benefit of the District and itscni-
zens—for the improvement of their property and
advancement of its value, every dollar of which
has been spent among them, and every dollar of
which they have received, over and above the ma-
ny millions which have been expended within the
District for public improvements and public build-
ings. Sir,I have no hesitation in saying that the above
appropriations were made, if not in direct violation
: of the Constitution, by usurpation unwarranted by
the Constitution, in violation of the people's rights,
and contrary to every principle of common justice
that should secure to them the proceeds of their
industry and toil. Congress is as much at liberty
and as much bound to appropriate the same pro-
portion of money to every other inhabited district
of ten miles square within the the United Stares, or
to appropriate in proportion to every other popula-
tion of forty thousand.
Let us see what the amount of appropriations
would be if Congress mete out the same liberality
to the American people generally which has been
fraudulently donated to the "poor people of the
District of Columbia"—fraudulent I say, for every
dollar which Congress appropriates to be expended
in the District of Columbia not necessary for pub-
lic and Government improvements, is fraudulently-
taken from the people; it is swindling them, and a
robbery of their Treasury. But now for the calcu-
1 lalion. The District of Columbia contains one
hundred square miles; the inhabited part of the
United States and Territoiies contain, in round
numbers, one million square miles. If the District
of Columbia, which contains one hundred ¡>quare
miles, has received three millions of dollars in gra-
tuitous donations out of the public Treasury, what
should the Territory of the United States receive,
which contains one million square miles. The an-
swer is the number of territories would be, when
divided, ten thousand, and ten thousand territories
multiplied by three millions (the amount given to
the District of Columbia) will show the enormous
sum of $30,000,000,000.
Yes, sir, if Congress had extended their appro-
priations to every inhabited territory of one hun-
dred square miles in the United States and Territo-
ries that are equally entitled, the amount wouid be
thirty billions of dollars. Or if you prefer a pro-
í i rata appropriation by population, I will give you
that. I have stated the population of the District to
be forty thousand. I believe the population of the
United Slates and Territories to be fifteen millions.
The question will then be, if forty thousand people
in this District have received three millions of dol-
lars of the publie money by gratuitous appropria-
tions, what should fifteen millions of people re-
ceive, who are equally entitled? The answer is,
$11,250,006,000. The pro rata appropriation, if
justice were done to the people, would be eleven
billions two hundred and fifty millions of dollars-
1 hear the answer: A gentleman says there are no
funds. Then, I say, cease to plunder the public
Treasury of the proceeds of honest labor Cease
to swindle the community by appropriating mil-
lions of their money to those who have no claims
upon either them or you. I have presented this
calculation by round numbers. I ha7e made it on
three millions of dollars. The actual amount ap-
propriated to the people of this District exceeds
that sum by two hundred and three thousand and
sixty-cne dollars. This I have dene to prevent ca-
villing about any portions of the appropriations
which it might be said were made for public pur-
poses.
Mr. Speaker, I have not made this expose for
the mere purpose of meeting the charge of ungene-
rous and contracted legislation toward the Dis-
trict of Columbia. I have made it for the pub-
lic eye, and the public rise. I have made it
with a hope that the people will hereafter call
their representatives to account, when, in viola-
tion of their rights, th«ir money is drawn annually
