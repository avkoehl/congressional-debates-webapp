Commanding West Gulf Squadron, Mobile Harbor:

By direction of the general-in-chief I have the honor to send you under guard two sailors, Frank Richmond and Mark Requesine, who were employed until lately in laying down torpedoes, mainly in the vicinity of Spanish Fort. They can probably be of some use to you by removing these obstructions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLONEL: Please order two of the very best pilots, who are well acquainted with the Alabama and Mobile Rivers and for some distance up the Tombigbee River, to report with as little delay as possible to Commodore Palmer, aboard steamer Glasgow, at the foot of Saint Francis street. The movements of army transports in the Alabama River depend on the early compliance with this order.

Yours, respectfully,
