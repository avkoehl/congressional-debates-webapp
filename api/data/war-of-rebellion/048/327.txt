HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, THIRD CORPS,OFFICE ASSISTANT COMMISSARY OF MUSTERS,

October 24, 1863

Major CHARLES HAMLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that about 8 a.m. on the 10th day of October, 1863, while near James City, Va., I was ordered by General Prince to carry the following message to the headquarters Third Army Corps:

The enemy have crossed the Robertson's River, and are advancing in three columns, and have made an attack on the pickets, compelling them to retire. General Prince has taken a position in which he intends to maintain himself, and desires to know if there are any further instructions for him.

This message was delivered by me to Major-General French, about 9 a.m. on the above date. I at the same time informed him, by Gener al Prince's direction, of a rumor that the One hundred and twentieth Regiment New York Volunteers was captured said regiment being at that time detached with cavalry in our front, at the request of Brigadier-General Kilpatrick. Major-General French directed me to say that he (General Prince) had his written instructions, by which he would be governed, and that in case the enemy advanced in superior numbers he would fall back to his original position, as it was not intended that General Prince should fight a battle.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN WILLIAN,

Captain, and Assistant Commissary of Musters.
