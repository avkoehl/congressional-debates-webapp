THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 31,
haps I ought to remember that an open confes-
sion is good for the soul, as well as it is for the
heart and head, and make some reference to the
remarks made yesterday by the gentleman from
Alabama, [Mi'/Houston.] I acknowledge that I
was in error in the statement which I then made,
as the gentleman was in error in the statement
which he then made. * I stated that the whole
amount of printing ordered Uy the House was
$29,699 19. The error I committed was when
tooting up the column, in not turning over the
page. I find that the aggregate amount of the
printing which the House has ordered tu be
printed, is $40,904 46. I make the correction
freely and frankly, with the statement that thegen-
tleman from Alabama was in error when he.said
that no portion of that work was to be paid for
to the Senate Printer, Mr. Bowman.
Mr. HOUSTON. The gentleman is too accom-
modating. He is disposed to confess for mo. I
will excuse him from doing that. I will make
my own corrections. The document was in my
hands only a few minutes when I sought to use
it, and 1 had not, of course, the opportunity to
examine it thoroughly. Ah soon as 1 had an op-
portunity of examining the document, I made the
correction. The difference between the gentleman
and myself is a very marked one. The gentle-
man has been sleeping over that document, in all
likelihood, for months. He has had it in his pos-
session all the while. His error, therefore, is
more grave in its character than mine. 1 am will-
ing, however, to receive the gentleman's confes-
sion. If he will make explanation of one or two
other crroM perhaps I will let him off.
Mr. HASIvlN. X reciprocate the good feeling
evinced by the gentleman from Alabama. The
gentleman referred, yesterday, to a small family
quarrel on this side of the House, and in the same
spirit I refer him to the small family quarrel on
his, the other side, to-day.
Mr. HOUSTON. I am glad the gentleman
from New York has classed himself at last. To
judge by his expression now, I presume that he
is no longer an ally, but that he is one of the othSr
side.
Mr. HASKIN. I am still an ally. Now, Mr.
Speaker, the gentleman from Alabama [Mr.
Clopton] argued yesterday against the estab-
lishment of a national printing office,and in favor
of the present system, modified by the introduc-
tion, to a certain exent, of the contract system
with it. One reason of his opposition to a na-
tional printing office was, that it would increase
patronage in the President of the United States.
He asserted that from four to five hundred men
would be employed in this Government printing
office, and therefore he had to object to it.
Well, sir, the.fact is, as the evidence before the
committee moves, that not more than one hun-
dred to one hundred and twenty-live men are ever
employed there as printers. But the proposition
which has been made by the gentleman from
Ohio, for the establishment of a Government
printing office, will not increase in the fVesident
of the United States one particle of patronage.
At this time, the President appoints the Superin-
tendent of the Public Printing. That Superin-
tendent is now a distinguished gentleman from
South Carolina, Mr. Heart, a practical printer,
who, I am glad to bear testimony, has performed
his duties well since I have known him. The
Superintendent of Public Printing in confirmed by
the Senate; and when the President makes that
appointment, under the bill proposed by my col-
league upon the Committee on Printing, [Mr.
Gurley,] all his patronage in connection with it
is spent. Then the Superintendent appoints two
foremen, and the foremen, who are practical
printers, employ men—practical printers—in the
office.
Mr, CLOPTON. The gentleman from New
York takes issue with me as to the number of
men who will be employed in a Government
printing office. He says the testimony shows
that not more than from one hundred to one hun-
dred and twenty-five will be employed. Mr.
Moore, who had charge of the public printing
under Duff Green, testified that there were about
one hundred hands employed; but Mr. Wendell,
who has done the public printing for six years,
testified, in answer to a question, that as many as
over four hundred hands were on the pay roll at
the height of the public printing.
Mr. HASKIN. " Hands" includes girls, boys,
and all who are not printers. That is the differ-
ence between us.
Now, sir, the answer to the gentleman's argu-
ment upon that head is contained in the fact that
printers have their typographical societies, in
which tho rates of their wages are fixed, and those
rates are as irrepcalable, so far as the employers
are concerned, as the laws of the Medes and the
Persians were. They are the most independent
class of operatives upon the face of the earth.
They can demand wages, and they get the wages
they demand. In this city they get fourteen dol-
lars per week for ten hours' work a day, when
they work by the week. Where they work by the
piece they get so much per thousand ems. The
einploymentof these men at fixed rates—fixedby
themselves—precludes the possibility that these
two foremen in the public printing office will not
do their duty, and that this Government printing
office will over be converted into a political hos-
pital, as has been said by some. There can be
no danger—not as much as under the present
system—of the Government not receiving a proper
quid pro quo for services which may be rendered
by the printers, under the system which is pro-
posed by my colleague upon the Printing Com-
mittee, [Mr. Gurley.]
The gentleman from Alabama referred to the
fact that public works were always more costly
than those done by private individuals. That is
true, to some extent; but I can say, upon this sub-
ject of the public pnnting, there is no other work
of the artisan which can be done so safely for the
interest of the Government as this. You have
your bureau of construction, your bureau of re-
pairs and supplies in the Navy Department; you
have, in the various navy-yards of this country,
your blacksmith shops; you have caulker and
cooper shops; you have ship-carpenter shops;
you have carpenter shops; and, indeed, shops for
nearly all branches of mechanical manufacture are
represented in some way under one or the other
Departments of this Government. So much for
that argument. Now, sir, the gentleman from
Alabama asserted that, under the contract sys-
tem, a saving would accrue to this Government.
That statement is refuted by the evidence adduced
before our committee, by which it appears that,
under the contract system, which existed from
lti46 to 1852, the work was done in a poorer man-
ner, and at a greater cost, including the bonuses
which were subsequently given to Congress, than
it cost under the old system. The contract sys-
tem has been tried, and it has proved a failure.
The system remaining yet to be tried is the sys-
tem proposed by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Gurley J We have tried the system with a tariff
of prices; and the exposition before the committee
of the Senate, and the Committee on Public Ex-
penditures of this House, proves that there has
been more extravagance and corruption under
that system, in this one department of the public
service, than in any other under the Government
since its formation.
The gentleman referred to the fact that the law
of 1852 was passed under the administration of
Mr. Fillmore. That law was cnacted on the 26th
of August, 1852, about the time of the adjourn-
ment of that session of Congress, nnd it went into
operation first at the short session under Mr.
Fillmore's administration. But the abuses which
we seek to remedy by the proposition of the
Committee on Public Expenditure have all been
introduced by the gross extravagance and corrup-
tion which existed in the public printing during
tho administration of Mr. Pierce, and especially
during the administration of Mr. Buchanan.
Now, sir, as a disparaging reference has been
made to the administration of Taylor and Fill-
more, I desire here to present some figures, show-
ing the expenses of this Government for the three
years under that Administration, and contrast
that with the expenditures during the three years
under the present Administration.

Showing a total of $80,445,204 91 of increase in
the expenses of the Government in the above four
Departments alone, during three years of this
Buchanan administration, over the expenses of
the same Departments, for three years in Taylor
and Fillmore's.
The table I have exhibited presents a statement
of the expenses of the four permanent Depart-
ments of War, of the Interior, of the Navy, and
of the Post Office Department; and the result of
the comparison shows that, under this Adminis-
tration, the expenditures of these four Depart-
ments, amounted to $80,445,204 91 more than they
were during the three years of the administration
of Taylor and Fillmore.
The following figures show the expenditures
under this Administration for the past three years,
in comparison with three years of the adminis-
tration of President Polk, inclusive of the year of
the Mexican war:

By this statement it will be found that, under
this Administration, there has been an increase in
the expenditures of more than twenty-five million
dollars a year over the expenditures under the
