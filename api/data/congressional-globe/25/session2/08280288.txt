issued, and the whole business to be pei formed, by
any other agent Nor w ould it change the prin-
ciple, to say «e had only pledged our resources
to a part, instead ol the «hole amount of liability,
or of our resource to discharge it
Now, said Mr C Congiess passed the law cie-
atmg the late Bank ol the United States. By the
same law this Government became a stockholder
and paitner with individual stockholders m that
bank We called it the Bank ( f the United Slates,
and authonzed ceitam agents, appointed under our
authority, to issue notes and bills, resting on the
joint ciedit, capitel, and gooJ faith of the stock-
holders (the United States included) for their re-
demption We also undeilook to participate in
the management of this joint capital Do not the
bills so issued at least puiport to involve the le-
sponsibihty of this Government1 and could we have
divested ourselves of that responsibility, moral as
well as legal, merelj by the payment ol our part of
the capital? I think, sir doubts may well be entei-
lained whether we could The Iw eieatmg the
bank, as veil as the form of its bills, gave them
currency and credit, as well upon the supposed
responsibility of the Government, to a certain
extent, as upon the capital invested The bills so
i sued, under our authoiiu, by agents appointed
by our duection, have retuimd, or mav return, is
this bill contemplólo, t > ih ir 1 uul-, oi to those of
sub agents constituted bj ihcm, when all sem-
blance oflifcht to thiott then ísain into circulation
has ceased Can it be supposed tint we va so
powerless th tue <an neuhei re--tiai or eonliol

volve a mamtest absuultty No sir, it cannot be,
and if we can restrain our igents from acting in
the manner alluded tj pciscnaltj and dircet'v, it
follows, necess ui',, that w c can restrain them from
so acting bv oi thiojgh the mstrumcntahi) if
others
The power to cintnl oi restrain, our agents,
from a violation of the tiust teposed in them, be
mg admitted or estal liJied, the m inner and means
we shall employ to accomplish that object aie mere
incidents A jurisdiction, or power cannot exist,
or be conferred, without attachm * all the mean-, el
its exeicise, or eairjing it into execution Give
a court jurisdiction and it unpin s that it sin 11
have all the pious , and ciher int i 'entil lowci ,
to give it complete cflcct bo when Gensrrc , oi
any other legislative bod), are, vested with powei
to pas.s laws, compelling or íes'nmuí" individu-
als, the manner in which they shall do it, whether
by mild or severe puialtiev—by the s"aflold or the
peiiitentnrj—is mere naüci  of sound discretion
But, sir, gentlemen say we aie not oound 1/
these bills ot the late bank, an 1 theiefe re we can-
not, and ought not, to pass ihe contemplated lau
Suppose we are not bound, neither would we be
bound by forged notes, nor any othei ec unierfeit
securities, purporting to involve the liibilit} o! the
United States, yet no person could deny our power,
or duly, to restrain a id pum h the making, ( r th
issuing, ol such iorged or counterfeit paper Ivor
can there be anj clifteipiiee in pnnctilf as leW
intimated, wnelher such spinous papT puiport-,
to be on this Gove nm< nt wholly or in part
But, sir, whatever d nVulty those who usualiv
support the Administration may feel in legislating
in the tnannei prope sed, how can the Opposition
lefuse to vote for the bill, unless they are willing
to sanction the reissue oí s ch extinct paper They
certainly can hav e no scrup'ei abou<. the exercise
of the power. They maintain that we not
enly have the powei, but tint it is our ¿i ty to male a
paper curt ency, and, if we hav e the pw er to create,
no one can doubt \ e have the pev er to tegiifa'e
such a currency AeccdiP? to meir doctrine, as
oteen avowed on this ltoor,we rave heretofore con-
stitutionally o-e-Uc i such i curenc), t irotigh the
agency of ¡he lite United States B nk—constituting,
as they and their lrienda aflin i, "the best curren
cy m the world " In exercising the power of re
gulatmg it, we authorized its circulation for twen y
yeais, after which, we provided it should cease
and the affairs of the m titution be woun 1 up Had
we the power to do all thi<—to create this "best
currency," for a limited period, at the same time
declaring it should not continue beyond that period
—and yet have no power to carry this regulation
into effect' No power to enforce a compliance
with a law, or to punish infractions of a law,
which, at least, according to Ihe doctrines of our
opponents, we had ample power to enact* Why,
sir, certainly no one should be foun 1 to maintain
propositions so ob\ íonsly inconsistent
If we do not possess, and do not also exercise,
this power, what will he the consequences?   Why,
sir, one result is, that we have conferíed a tempo-
rary authority, evpievdy  limited to a certain pe-
nod m the grant, and jet oui creature, in defiance
of the veiy law of its cieation, is bejond our con-
trol, and maj com.nue its most important functions

the community a spurious papei cunency, to the
amount of as many millions as have been manu-
factured by the late United Slates Bank, and may
now be in existence as long as it may suit the will

RKMARKS OF MR  CALHOUN,
Oi   Sol hi  Cm oi^a
In Senate, Jlpnt 2J, 181b—U¡ on die bill t > pr<-v cnl
the issuing and  circulatioi  of  the bills, notes,
and secunbps 01  corp irations created bj   Con-
g >ss which have expired
Mr C \LHOUN said, that as the question was
about to be put on the engrossment, he rose not to
discuss the subject at large, but simplv to state the
reasons which would govern his vote.   Th? hour
was late, and the Senate impatient to adjourn, and
he would promise to detain them but a íew mi-
nutes
When the bill was taken up jesterday, he had
never turned his attention seriously to the subject,
and he listened attentively, in erder to make up his
mind, both as to oui power, and the expediency of
passing the bill The result was, that he found
himseli m precisely the same state of uncertainty
which the Senator from Virginia described himself
to be, and was leheved when he (the Senator)
moved an adjournment, with a view to obtain time
lor farther deliberation Had he been forced to
vote then, it would have been against the bill, as
it was an invariable 1 ule with him, when he doubt-
ed on constitutional questions, to vote m the nega-
tive Since then, he had calmly and deliberately
investigated the subject, and the result was a tho-
lough conviction that we possessed the power, and
ought to exeicise it, and he proposed now to assign
his reasons
He held that the right proposed to be exercised
in this case rested on the general powei of legisla-
tion conferred on Congress, which embraces not
onlj the power oí making, but that ol repcaln g
hws It was. m fact a portion oí the repealing
powei No one could doubt the existence oí the
n,ht to lo cither, and that the right oí íepeahng
ev mis is well to unconstitutional as constitutional
ltws 'Ihe case as lo the former was in fact
stt onger than the Utter, (or, vvhethci a constitu-
tional law should be repealed or not, was <i ques-
tn 11 of ccpedienej, which left us iree to act ac-
coiding to our discretion, while in the case of an
unconstitutional law, it was a matter of obligation
and duty, leaving no option, and the more uncon-
stitutional, the moie imperious the obligation ard
duty finis far there could be no doubt nor diver
si ty of opinion
Hut there are many laws, the eflVetsof which do
not cc.tsi wnh then repeal or expiration, and which
re juire some additional act on our part to arrest or
nil lo them Such, for instance, is the one in ques-
non rIhe charter of the late bmk expnecl some
tune ago, but its notes are still m existence, ireely
ciKula'mg iiom hand to hand, and reissued and
Ivnked on by a bank chartered by the State of
Pennsylvania, into whose possession the notes of
the old bank have passed In a word, onr name
and authority are used almost as freely for banking
purpose as they were before ths expiration of the
charter of the late bank Now he held that the
rij'ht of arresting or undoing these aftci-effects
rested on the same principle as the right of repeal-
ing a law, and, like that, embraces u icon--tilu-
tional as well as constitutional acts, supeiaddmg-, m
the case oí the fonner, obligation and duly to
right We have an '"t stration oí the truth ot
this principle in the case of the alien and sedi-
tion acts, which are now conceded on ail sides
to has e been unconstitutional t tke the act incorpo-
rating the late bank, thev expired by iheir own
limitation, and like it, also, their effects continued
after tht peno I of tneir expiration Individual,
had been tued, convicted, fined, and imprisoned
under thern, but so lar was their unconstitutionali-
ty from being regarded as an impediment to the
n< ht ot arresting or undoing these effects, thaf Mr
Teilerson felt himself compelled on that very ac-
count to pardon those who had been fined and con-
victed under their provisions, and we have at this
scsM >n passed, on the same ground, an act to rc-
íune1 the money paidbj one-' of the sufferers under
tl em The punciple is too clear to require Inrthei
il'uslrnt on, and the difficulty which some have felt
in voting lor this bill, because they believe that 'Iip
chirter ol the 1 ite bank was unconstitutional, and
rprchended th<-t die passage of the bill would m-
cir civ lecogmse it constitutionality, woanl, !•
tiusic 1, be enm ly removed by what he had said
Sif 1 i therwise, it imposed a duty on vis to act as
f u is w e may hav e the power, and this brings up
the question how fai we have the rjght, m this
case, to arrest or undo the consequences, still re-
sulting from the charter of the late bank, notwith-
standing its expiration
