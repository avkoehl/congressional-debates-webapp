DEMOPOLIS, February 19, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

In the existing emergency it is of the utmost importance that arms should be had immediately for commands that are legitimately raised, when arms are not always on hand, and delays are highly detrimental. I ask that I may be permitted to use the arms of the Trans-Mississippi Department, now within reach, with a view to their being replaced hereafter.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.]

FEBRUARY 19, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War, with a copy of telegram sent to General Polk's chief of ordnance.

J. GORGAS,

Colonel.

[Inclosure.]

FEBRUARY 19, 1864.

Colonel J. M. KENNARD,

Demopolis:

You can take arms of Trans-Mississippi Department if absolutely required for unarmed men, not otherwise.

J. GORGAS,

Colonel.

DEMOPOLIS, February 19, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

I am much in want of troops. Should like to have all I can get up in my department, and ask that Colonel Preston designate the companies which he requires for supporting force to his work of conscription. I understand he wants certain number only, and let the rest be turned over for organization.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

MOBILE, February 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

By very hard work we saved all stores at Meridian; all at Enterprise, including all Government cotton in shipping order, except corn in the shuck. Everything below Enterprise will be saved. Our shop tools at Enterprise and all our rolling-stock except eight or ten cars have been saved. The whole movement was conducted with the utmost coolness and deliberation, and was entirely successful. The Government is indebted in a great measure for these results to Major George Whitfield, who remained with me and rendered the most valuable assistance. I shall communicate these facts to President Davis, and will thank you to indorse them.

L. J. FLEMING,

Chief Engr. and General Supt. Mobile and Ohio Railroad.
