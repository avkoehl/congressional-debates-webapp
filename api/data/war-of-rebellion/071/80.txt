WASHINGTON, July 6, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Augur is of opinion that one regiment of heavy artillery should be returned to Washington, to be distributed among the 100-days' militia in the forts, as the latter are not sufficiently instructed in the use of heavy batteries.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., July 6, 1864.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding, &amp;c.:

The troops going to Washington need not take teams, ambulances, or ammunition, except what they carry in boxes. I expect them back here so soon that there is no necessity for transporting the teams back and forth. Besides there is now in Washington about 600 teams ready for issue, if necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 6, 1864.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding, &c.:

I have no doubt but that the force you have sent to Washington will prove sufficient, and not only that, but that they will speedily return the cavalry fully mounted and equipped. Hunter has got a portion of his force up to the enemy, and is concentrating the balance as rapidly as possible. If they succeed in nearly annihilating Ewell, Breckinridge, &c., Hunter will be able to move through to Charlottesville and utterly destroy the railroad and canals without the help of the troops sent from here.
