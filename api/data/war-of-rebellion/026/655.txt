Several regiments are here whose terms expire in few days. What shall I do with them?

SUFFOLK, VA., April 25, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

It only goes to show that they have no idea of leaving. The impression is that new troops are arriving. One brigade is certainly here from North Carolina. Several bands of music were playing last evening on the high ground. When will the other 10-pounder Parrotts be up? We need more in the field-works in order to release the horse batteries. Not less than twenty pieces are requisite for General Getty's line, which reduces our stock.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

[APRIL, 25, 1863.]

General HOOKER:

One brigade has just joined Longstreet from Carolina. He is bringing very heavy artillery. He means to take his time.
