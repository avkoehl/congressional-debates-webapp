HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 24, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN BUFORD,

Commanding Reserve Brigade of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am directed by Brigadier-General Pleasonton to state you will take post with your command near Dumfries, keeping the country in that vicinity and south of it clear of bushwhackers, guerrillas, and rebel scouts. General Gregg's command protects the Rappahannock and the Orange Railroad, and we ought not to be much annoyed by the enemy within that country. If they should be troublesome, it can only proceed from the residents, and they will be made to understand that, unless they preserve order, they and theirs will be treated as enemies in arms, and that the most prompt and summary punishment will be inflicted on them. The residents must be made responsible for the preservation of good order in the districts in which they live. The general desires you will use exertion to place your command in a high state of efficiency at the earliest practicable moment, and keep your command in readiness at all times for any sudden emergency that may arise. The general assures you of his confidence and ernest desire to assist you be all the means in his power. Report fully and frequently by letter, and telegraph anything of importance that occurs.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. COHEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
