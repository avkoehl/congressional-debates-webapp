[CHAP. XXXI.

Halleck informs me that he considers it inexpedient to remove the regiment from the works in front of Washington at the present time. I will send you Whipple's division to-morrow. Heavy firing was reported this morning in the direction of Bolivar Heights and Charlestown.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,October 16, 1862-7.15 p.m.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN, Arlington:

Let Whipple's division be ready to take the cars to-morrow morning at an early hour, of which I will give you precise notice as soon as receive reply from president Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

RICH'D B. IRWIN,

Captain, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 16, 1862.

Major General JACOB D. COX, Gallipolis, Ohio:

Your dispatch received. I had already telegraphed to you in regard to wagons, which it will be difficult to procure from here without delaying your movements. Ascertain at once whether you can get them in the neighborhood, as well as the tools you require. I should be glad to exchange new regiments for the Tennessee troops, but experience shows that the former cannot be counted upon in time for your operations. There has been some unaccountable delay in supplying Morgan's command. The fault is here, I believe. Can the force sent to the Sandy Valley operate on both sides of that river? A regiment or two on this side seems to be called for. Quartermaster's supplies for 30,000 men, including Morgan's command, have been sent to Western Virginia.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 16, 1862.

Major General JACOB D. COX, Gallipolis, Ohio:

Can you spare a regiment from your forces for service in Eastern Kentucky, and, if not, can you send me a good officer, Colonel Cranor for instance, who has experience and knows the country, to command a force to be sent there? Answer at once. This must not interfere with your operations.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 16, 1862.

Gov. ANDREW G. CURTIN, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Any regiments which may have been detained by you, or which are at Harrisburg, ready for the field, will be sent to this place.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
