GREENEVILLE, TENN., May 15, 1865.

Major G. M. BASCOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Knoxville:

The troops of Generals Palmer and Govan are infantry. The field officers are mounted on private horses. The cavalrymen are with General Palmer. He has ten wagons (mule teams), same number of ambulances, and a small supply train. I have no means of knowing the amount of transportation with General Govan's brigade, only that he has the usual field transportation. General Palmer's command was with Johnston and Hood in the Atlanta and Nashville campaigns. It is not the Palmer who commanded Confederate forces in this section.

Secretary of War:

I see it stated in the telegraphic dispatches that I have been removed from command on account of sympathy with traitors, and failing to protect Union men, &amp;c. I withdraw my letter asking to be mustered out, and ask a rigid investigation into all my official acts.
