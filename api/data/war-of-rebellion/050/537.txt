for me to mention each member of the division by name in this report.

To my staff, Captains Barlett, Wells, Metzner, Taft; Lieutenants A. S. Smith, J. J. Kessler, Edward Davis, I owe my thanks for their efficiency and gallantry on the battle-field. Captains Barlett and Wells were with me all the time, and were frequently sent to points of danger; their duties were faithfully and fearlessly performed.

Lieutenant F. N. Sheets, of my staff, was killed, He was a brave and gallant young gallant young man, and died as heroes wish to die.

My thanks are due to Captain Simonson, my chief of artillery, and all the artillery officers, for good and gallant service. My thanks are due to my medical director, Surg. Charles Schussler, and the other medical officers of the division. They were untiring in their exertions to alleviate the pain of the suffering.

My escort and orderlies performed their duties well. Among them I mention Sergeant Miles, Third Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry, and Private Robert Hays, Thirtieth Indiana.

The country must mourn the loss of gallant spirits who offered their lives upon her altar. For a list, reference is made to sub-reports.

The first Brigade captured five pieces of artillery, and the Third Brigade two pieces. About 600 prisoners were captured by the division and sent to the rear.

It is a source of great pleasure to me to know that the Second Division did not yield an inch; that it defeated every force, whether attacked or attacking.

The list of casualties shows that it did hard fighting.

Respectfully submitted.

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.

Lieutenant Colonel G. P. THRUSTON,

Chief of Staff, Twentieth Army Corps.
