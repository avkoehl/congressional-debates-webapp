lot of horses and mules. Colonel Wolford, who was in command here, told the gentleman with whom he boarded this morning that General Burnside, with his whole army, left Knoxville on yesterday for Loudon. The story is not credited. We are lying in line of battle to-night, and except to advance early to-morrow. Prisoners, stock, &amp;c., have been sent forward toward Charleston. It is confidently hoped you will move up your forces immediately.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY BRIGADE,2 1/2 Miles from Sweet Water, October 21, 1863-2 p.m.

The colonel commanding directs me to say the enemy is advancing on us with infantry and cavalry. Their cavalry is threatening our left and rear. We have a strong position here, and can hold it unless flanked. Colonel Morrison is protecting our left. We skirmished with them before retiring from Philadelphia, and sent one regiment toward their rear, near up to Loudon, which we suppose has checked the advance of their infantry, as it has not developed itself in our front here. All the captured property has already been sent forward. Two regiments are still holding Philadelphia, with instructions to fall back here if hard pressed.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY BRIGADE,2 1/2 Miles from Philadelphia, October 21, 1863-6 p.m.

The enemy failing to advance upon us this side of Philadelphia, I ordered forward our skirmishers, who drove them back through the town. Our advance vedettes stand just out this side of Philadelphia. I think their main force has fallen back to Loudon. In the Federal mail captured yesterday one letter states that there was a division of infantry at Loudon to fall back on when pressed too hard. Another, dated yesterday, that Burnside was advancing with his whole force to Loudon; that it was impossible for them to subsist in East Tennessee unless they held the line of the railroad through this end of the State. Our best information is, there were only three regiments of Federal infantry out from Loudon to-day. We this evening forwarded to your commissary about 75 head fine Kentucky captured beef cattle. If possible, we will be obliged if a few can be reserved for us. I have just heard from Colonel Morrison that he is encamped to-night to my rear, between this and Sweet Water. All the roads are well picketed.

By order of Colonel G. G. Dibrell, commanding brigade:

DIXON A. ALLISON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
