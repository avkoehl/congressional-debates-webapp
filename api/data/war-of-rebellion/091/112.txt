Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that nothing has occurred in this vicinity for the past twenty-four hours worthy of mention. Information considered very reliable has reached here to-day that in the skirmish with the Thirteenth New York Cavalry on the last scout of that regiment Colonel Mosby was seriously wounded, a pistol-bullet striking the handle of the pistol in his belt and glancing off in his groin. He was able, however, to ride off, but soon failed, and was carried in a wagon to a place of safety. Heavy artillery firing was heard this morning in the direction of Ashby's Gap.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. S. GANSEVOORT,

Colonel Thirteenth New York Cavalry, Commanding.
