CAMP WARREN, March 22, 1864.

Major-General McCLERNAND:

I have the honor to say to you that the enemy, about 40 in number, reconnoitered the reefs to-day about 10 a.m., approaching our pickets on the reef, while a body appeared on the mainland so far off as not to be very distinctly seen by the pickets as to number; after staying, viewing our position, about one and a half hours, disappeared.

Very respectfully,

JAMES ARMSTRONG,

Captain Texas Scouts.
