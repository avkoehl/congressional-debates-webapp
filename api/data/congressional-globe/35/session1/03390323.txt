tion of any o ^. But this disavowal is not import-
ant. The amcizing fact m reference to this
calumny is, I hat no such article as the one indicated
by the honorable gentleman from Virginia has ever,
at any time, appeared in the columns of the Chicago
'Times. This fact, at least, if it existed could be
easily proven, and I defy the gentleman to pro-
duce the evidence. If he fails, which he most as-
suredly will, the charge is not only shown to be
false, but utterly destitute of foundation or plaus-
ibility from the beginning.
I do not, Mr. Chairman, charge the honorable
gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Smith] with willful
falsehood or misrepresentation. Frti be that from
me. I have too high an appreciation of what is
due to this body, and to the position of the hon-
orable gentleman, even to insmnnto such a charge
for a moment. I would not believe for a moment
that any gentleman occupying a seat on this floor,
nnv.'h less one so distinguished as the honorable
member, would be guilty of so base a fabrication,
or of giving it currency, knowing it to be false.
But what I complain of, what the friends of Judge
Docc.las have a right to complain of, is that the
gentleman should, without investigation, pick up
from the purlieus and streets of Washington anon-
ymous slanders against a distinguished statesman,
fabricated by plunder-gorged parasites, and the
miserable„ leprous, hungry pack who are ready to
baric at the heels of any one who they may think is
under the ban of power—slanders which have been
floating around the streets of Washington all win- '
ter, but which the friends of judge Dotgi.as
deemed wholly unwotthy of their notice. We
have a right to complain that so distinguished a
grntiL'ui.m should lend his name to give ctuiencv
to chorees winch before? weie unworthy of notice,
a.id allow himself to become the conduit through
which i hi*? miserable spn wn of malice and defama-
tmnshould be pouird forth upon the House,and
sent out to infect the moral atmosphere of the
whole country.
Mr. Cit urman, 1 shall append to my remarks,
when printed [see appendix] the article winch
Mr. Calhoun lias indicated as the one which he
supposed i e flee tea l!t" vie Wo of ,T udgc 1 lurc.LAs Oil

be fi anied at Lecomplon. Calhoun first saw it in
a Kansas paper, copied f'-om the Chicago Times.

October, JSou. I have evidence, satisfaetorv to I
my sell, that .1 nd Douglas knew nothing of this j
ar:iele at the time it appeared , and probably never j
saw it until 1 tune-died into, a few day.; ago, n \
copy of the Tinier in v.hi'h it appaif d. But,
be ihis ;is it may, n vol be seen thai, the {i  f,ieie,

and I l ave no he: 'intern in <aying, that if the

The following is the articic which appeared in
j the Chicago Times, October 14th, 1856, which has
| been indicated by Mr, Calhoun as the one which
! he supposed reflected the views of Mr. Douglas
j in regard to the mode in which the constitution
; framed at Lecompton should be submitted to the
i people of Kansas for their ratification or rejection:
i {£Kansas—Tin: Constitutional Convention.—The
; convention which wa< elected 111 Kansas to fiame a State
constitution for that Terutorv, will soon meet ajiain. They
cannot (ail to lia\o ob^ei ved, what all the rest of the vvoild
has nbsetvod, that the voice nt' thy people of Kansas i-s m
favoi of a fice State. We know not \\ hat may be the pur-
pose or the foehn^ of the delegates upon the question of
slavery, but the leeent election ha«, demonstrated that noth-
ing else than a coiis.fittmon luoli shall exclude and pro-
hibit slavery, will be accepted by the, people of the Terri-
tory. That tUct is patent, thai no man can shut his eyes
to it.
" It is saul that the convention, when elected, wan unani-
mously pro-slavery; that we know to be untiue ; we know
that thete were many deleft,\\ liu weie in lnvor of obev-
I intf Ihe wi^he<; of the people, and a m.vjonty in t:i\or of
submitting then action, no nrUter wb.u it w.^,to popular
| appcoval or rejection at the poiK What that convention
, will do, or what it will not do, we have not the moans of
' knowing. But we know th.it any attempt to force a pio-

ip'i, ajraiii, uii'- the mtenijon to do so was not re-
vived until the verv ev:traoiuuipry sp-'cch of the
gentleinan Aoin m \!:.~achnseUs, delivered this
eveninu. I ha ,7 i< f- .v lommcnts to niaive upon
that spf rch. I h we already addressed the House
' uoon this suhjtM-t, and hove given the prominent
reasonr- which will contiol my vote. in
I speaking upon it, ] have not spoken as a northern
! man, nor os a southern man, nor as a man reflect-
ing the views of any section of this country; and
I hope the day may never come when, in making
my record as one of the legislators of this nation,
I shall give utterance to sentiments confincd to any
section. I addressed myself to the question in its
bearings upon flie whole country, both North and
South; and m what I have to say this evening", I
shall not forget, I trust, that this is one branch of
the Congress of the United States.
I do propose, however, for a very short time, to
bring before the committee a subject that, in my
humble opinion, is exceedingly small. I mean the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Marshall,] and
the speech which he has just delivered. The gen-
tleman was pieascd, in the course of his remarks,
when I put a question to him that was pertinent
to the subject under discussion, and which legit-
imately grew out of the positions which he as-
sumed and the arguments he advanced, to make
an allusion to my record. I am a humble man,
yet my record is, to me, of as much importance
as the record of any other gentleman is to him.
And, sir, this is not the first time that this insin-
uation has been made upon the floor of this Hou^e.
Sir, I owe no allegiance to southern men, or to
northern men, or to any other men, except the
constituency who ^.ent me here. When I vote I
shall vote the eonv;cuons of my judgment, and
bid defiance to evcty .section.
I have to say simply, that the man, be he rep-
resentative or sovereign, prince or peasant, leader
or follower, who, in this Hall or elsewhere, mi-
pnies fo me, at the pre^enttime or in the past,any
sympathy wh'i the eVce-Soil party, the Aboli-
tion paity, or any other one-idea patty that 1ms
ever dietur'v d tiifk peace of this country, is a li-
heh-r, Mid m tkvs a charge which lie cannot sua-
ten* I v eil nndeirfni'd that gentlemen living out-
side of my district and State (I, humble as I am,
have had my enemies) may gather up worn-out,
refuted, and repudiated charges of the Republican
paify, and reproduce them upon this iloor. I
{jejune mat they amount to this: that on certain
occasions I have seen proper to bolt the Dcmo-
ciatic, nominations, hut not v/lv n involving any
question of T^ree-ooihrun, or any other question
of principle, nor when I was in any way bound
by them, b'ir, ( plend crnd'y to the charge; ,jirl
twice ]imo diiie'ent consiituencies, one le-je1:-:--;
from tiie center of the Suite to her western bo: d' r,
and the other from the center of the Ste.te b- In-r
casern border, acquitted me of all blame anting
out of that chaise of bolting the regular Demo-
eiRtic nomination. W'k never I am not m bone.-

any other Lection of tins (,'onloder.cy.
The genii'nnaji liorn Illinois wan |ileesed, io
the form of an insinuation, to reproduce this
charge, r-nd then abandon it under the idea that
it Ytvs a,-i exceedingly email matter. A matter

hl:e iiiiii who decs tlie act of the coward, " who
n ise« his arm to r.tuke, end lies not the courage
to rv/c the bloTv."

comnntn w<th a long and rambling disconrs-,
p. cedmo'ly bitu r in its character and far below tlio

ber, s,r. that at the beginning of tins session, that
insidious and treacherous doctrine wh.ch the gen-
tle mnu now is piocieimirii;, f.r^t manifested itself
upon the surface of the politics of the country.
The public pre-'s attributed to him alone, of the
Illinois delegation, the position of standing aloof
fiom it. Tnat gentleman then felt himself celled
upon to come out ma card in the Union newspa-
per— that same debased and despised organ, ps he
