PULASKI, TENN., January 26, 1864.

Colonel MIZNER, Columbia:

We are still holding Athens, and with troops now there I think we will succeed. The first report form there was party wrong. The trains only left. The troops stopped and were still fighting when last heard from. All my mounted men went to Florence and Colbert Reserve to attack Johnson. I except them to fall upon the rear of the force that crossed at Brown's ferry. A small detachment of the Ninth still hold Athens, but now are are-enforced by Kemper's pioneer corps and the bridge-builders near there. I can hold all my points, but have nothing to follow up with unless troops at Florence get after them.
