General BOYLE:

Rebel force [1,500 strong] reported at Orleans. They were reported south of Paoli this morning. I am not satisfied as to the whereabouts of the men to-day. Should they cross Grassy Flats, have you anything to intercept them? They feel confident at Madison. The Jeffersonville [train] came through safe this evening. Governor Morton wishes to know whether troops can be sent down to Grassy Flats by land, or can be landed near there, with good position for artillery. Are there gunboats sufficient?

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The following dispatches just received:

FIRST DISPATCH.

Have just examined a reliable employe of the Jeffersonville Railroad, who left Vienna at 6 o'clock this morning. He says it was agreed in Vienna that Morgan himself, with 11,000 men and from sixth to twelve pieces of artillery, passed through Vienna, toward Lexington, this morning. From this I judge Morgan's whole force [say 4,000 are trying to cross the river.

SECOND DISPATCH.

A prisoner from Duke's regiment left Morgan at Vienna this morning; deserted. He says the rebels were in great haste, and says all he could gather of the intention of the raid it was to pass through Indiana and Ohio and join Lee in the East; that the programme was carried out up to his leaving. I have no doubt they are hurrying to cross the river.

JOHN LOVE,

Five of my scouts have just returned from near Salem. They report that about 1,000 rebels have taken the road for Brownstown. This is reliable. Have not heard anything about Morgan's main force since noon.
