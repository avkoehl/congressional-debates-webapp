the line of battle exactly, on account of the lack of water. The fighting ground in front being good, it will not be necessary that they should be on it.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, September 21, 1863-10 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding,&amp;c., Rossville:

The general commanding directs me to say, it the opinion is well founded that the enemy only made to-day a reconnaissance in force, and that they did not advance their infantry and are still encamped where there is water, it would be well to hold our ground with the rear guard, using the picket line as skirmishers, directing them to retire under cover, taking new positions and keeping the artillery well in the distance. He also directs that a staff officer be sent well in advance of your columns to meet the officer sent from these headquarters to indicate the position to be taken by the command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK S. BOND,

Major, and Aide-de-Camp.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

GENERAL: The general commanding directs you to make details to be ready to commence work at 6 a.m. to-morrow on rifle-pits which will be laid out by engineer officers to connect the work. Rude breastworks must be constructed with all possible speed. Each corps will pickets its own front, throwing out grand guards at least a mile to the front, and farther if practicable. The picket line must be a strong skirmish line. Abatis must be constructed in front of the breastworks whenever possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Major-General Crittenden, McCook,* and Stanley.)
