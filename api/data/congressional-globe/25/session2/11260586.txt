was a Government, and now, for the first time to turn round
and declare that Government is not bound in any way to c^n
cern itself about the currency! That it is not «a province to
take any measures to regulate and equalize the exchanges?
What one mteiest comes nearer home to the people, to the
whole people, to eveiy man m the community, than that of the
cunency m which we are to pay oui debts, to collect our dues,
to realize out laboi, and, in a weid, to conduct our whole busi
maul If the Government has no concern in an interest like
this, it has no concern with the ptospenty or happiness of the
nation
Such was the mes age of SeptPinbet, and what is that with
which the piesent session h ts been opened? Does it suund a
different note? Does it recommend a difleient policy? Does it
evince that wisdom wh ch is the fruit of experience, that mag
nanimity which is prompt to acknowledge a di covered orror?
Iso, «ir1 No, sir' with unyielding, unielemmg, unpityng stern*
nes«,K adhere  to the course already pmsued lo lelioe the
Government, to sustain the Government, to accommodate the
Gove iiment this, and thi? alone ísussc^pe and aim With
this sole view, Us measures are recommended, to this hour not
one solitary measure has been proposed to us by the President
ior the relief of the conntiy
I shall keiebe remm led that the message lecommends the
Sub Treasury scheme That measure has, indeed, for tli° pre
s ent, been ¡.offered to «dumber, but I apprehend that it is bat
held in reserve,and that the people are jet to enjoy the fulness
oí its blessings And what, sir, is theSub Tieatoiry scheme bat
another experiment An experiment not meiety on the hnan
cial policy of the Government, but an expeumenton the peo
pie, and one more bold and daring than has yet been attemp ed
by any Administration It is put foi win! ma h d, just as the
phy&iuan extends Ins learned finger, an 1 ihus feels the pulse of
the patient on wh «m he is, to opeia e With cagaci ma touch,
he watches every vibrition, that he may judae from this tet,t the
state of the system subjected to his skill Just so i* it now at-
tempted to foci the pulae of the American people, and cautious
ly to try how far they will submit to innovation on their esta
blished institutions,and to what extent they will peimit ei
uoachment oti their lights Sir, I will ventuie to&ay that the
indications thus far are not encouraging Tin*, darling mea
sure of the Admini tration has mat from the American nation
such a greeting as rr ight have been expected from a tree and
intelligent people Su, the medicine will not betaken The
patient hai too much will, he must b** further reduced, he
rou>t be brought lower and madesickei before he will swallow
the do c Such seems to be th« policy íosoíved upen, but he
wno experta thit it will he submitted to vaiy much mistake?, m
my apptehension, the Amencan chatacter Sir are there no
symptoms of resistance* lias no voice come up from the va!
ley no sound reveibetat^d iiom the lull? Is o entire states
gone off m solid column? Mi, the muueimg thunriei mayal
icady be heard, it comes with every breeze it jolts at once
around the entire horizon It peals in the Nor'b, and is an
sweredand re echoed by yet louder peals horn the South and
the West Willgentltmen cloi>e their eais? Shall public opi
nion, expies&ul with so much clearness and so much unani
mity, be disi"garded by tho&e who are every day professing that
the wishes of the people are their súpleme law? Sir, this Sub
Treasury bill has been figunng largely in another part of
this building, and Us discussion has called forth much splendid
talent and many profound and masterly views of national
policy But thelittle¡ the very little ceremony with which u
has been tieated by this ijfouse, mighv one would thu k re id i
lesion to its friends as to the degree of its estimation m this
branch of theLegisla'me No si oner did u '-how its lice in
this House, than it was promptly laid upon fit tab e, noi was
this the fii st gieetmg of the kind which thit pi "position le
ce i ved from the assembled Repres ntatives oí the Amercan
people At ihe special session it recaived a similar fate, and
it was generally hoped that the vo e which then placed it on
your table had consigned it to the peaceful shades of eternal
repose
But no, sir, the President or at least his oigan ht* e thechair
man of the Com mi tee of Ways and Means has disturben i 3
slumbering ashes the vaultsha^e been thrown open, the bais
and the strong boxes have given way, and its ghost stalks
through this House a portent ms ''hide, threatening the hvinp
with all the horrors oí its prison house {have, been at a loss to
imagine what can be the motive of the Admimstiation in thus
deteimining to urge ti b passage of tins bill against the known
will of the people They canuo pretend ignorance If they
have any doubt", let them inquire of the Connec icut delegation
]s.o, sir, they have no doubt*, about the matter 1 hat plea can
avail theii no longer Why then insist so dopeiately on tin
measure? Is it t'i<u hey hope to build a fonre«e where they
m^y set public sentiment at defiance? Do they hope lo erecta
bul walk wh ch shall sepdiate the Government from the people,
and against which the thundeis of public indignation may be
hurled in vain? I* it to pro\ id* them elves wth aiefugc where
they may in safety share the "spoils of victoty" wung from
the hands of a vanquished people, vanquished in then own
stronghold, this Hull of their chosen lepresen atives'* If that is
the hope I trust, sir it will be effectually Idighted
What is this Sub Tieasmy scheme! Let us look at it fir a
moment If I comprehend it, the plan piopo=Rs¡ t* place the en
tire levemteef this Government for distribution ?nd safe keep
mg in the band? of individual receivers holding their appoint
ment fiom the Pre idem's recommendation, at d subject to re
mo val at his pleasure The money is to be put unreservedly in
their hands, professedly to be kept, and practically and in fee
to be used by them, under no otliei restraint than the dread of
detection an 1 exposui e ííut, allowing them to be ever so ho
neetj it wili, umlei such a system, be ni"the power of the Exf cu
tive to favor ©r to oppress any portion of die country at hie v\ 11
He can plaee the public funds at any piint and to any amount
that may «int his own purposes He can thus, p aoish or reward
at wilt He can dram the Wee' and fill the Sout n or East when
soever he will, he can t*A * engeance on obnoxious State*, and
can reward obedient ©t-Uesin a mannar v nch can^flt be ift
eisted or injured into 'i he opeia ion cai t on, and the pcoj 'e
know nothing abodt the matter til] they rrrtit through t ^
effects These offices, while their afficto will be eo great, will
themselves be little other than mere sinecure —Government
et-rawbernts—rewards for favorites, a retirement for fcrrken
{lows party hacks, worn out in character and propeity "Who
«hall limit their number? Judging from the experience of fo
reign Governments where the system l^a*been adop'ed,we ftmv
expect them to multiply like the locusts m Egypt, and, like
thee  locusts, they will eat out our substance In the hands cf
these men, the entire treasure of the country is to be deposited
Indepentdenl Treasury—Mr. Goode.
Seme of them will hold under their lock and key millions of the
public raonfj. It will be drawn from the hande of the hard
working man, to be poured, at the President's beck and plea
sure, into the pocketsof this army of meiccnanes, thejamzaries
of the ihrone Sir, we have heaid much of the dangei of uniting
t he purse and the sword let that bill become a law, and the thing
is done The President will have at his disposal not only the
military, but the moneyed power of ue Republic And think
you a power like thi  will be suffered to sleep? Wtfi such an
instrument rust foi want of using? Never, sir, never In the
good old times of genuine Democracy—I mean the days ol 1 ho
mas JfefJeison—had an officer of this General Government at
tempted, m the slightest ds^vee, to influence theftee election? of
the people, he would have been instantly dismissed from ofhee
But how is it n wí The vuy reverse is true That office
holder who lefu^ts to exeit his wholeindustiy and miluenre at
the biilfot boxes, may count upon being turned out as soon as
Ihe election is over Ir^ is no longer worihv to be trusted He
has betrayed his tiust, filled m hie fiistand highest duty Such
is the state of things with euch powei astheE^ecu'ive now pos
sesses Give him this Sub Treasuiy bill, and how long will it
be till State oifims and Congressional represen aíives will be
chosen by a rescript iiom the throne? Such is the measure pro
posed by the Executive tw meet and to relieve the distresses of
« suffering piople Flue n the Admini&uation's physic for all
the ills of the Republic
But sir, they prepaitd for ws another do«ie and though we
would not swallow tht first, we were compilled to take the
second This was the bill to postpone the piyment of the
fouith instalment of the df tubution act By this the people
weie dtmjvtd of mi e mi'hons of dollaisto which they were
entrled, bothm law and equity The money was a surpjus,
collected Aom the people, over and above the wants of the Go
vemment Three othfi instalments had (though with infinite
reiucunce, and in the woist possible w iy)been already return
ed to them they were equally entitled t<t ti e residue, but no,
they could not have it, tht, PrrM tent had need of it The Tiea
bury ta'led lor it an 1 we gave it at their earnest entreaty, but
not with my vote Was thisali? Iso, sir, we had heard agreat
uuise «iboui ¿cold, we weie told of the-va^t amount of it which
had flowed m under the wi e mi asures of this hard money Ail
ministration, but when matters came to the point, the gold
wa3 rot to be I iund No, nr, b r the silver either The Tiea-
sury wis m astiait, the nntioral money box was full of empti
nest-, and these haid money, gold boasting, gold importing,
gold promising rulers came to Congress for the issue often
millions of Government papei Ay, sir, ten millions of paper
money—Treasury promise* This was the Administration
gild that was to shine through the silken purses of our faimeis'
wives an J daughters Well, Mr, we gave them what they
asked They w°re \eiy huuabie, veiy ttankful, and mido
many piomipes that they would tiever ask for anv move &ix
months havee'apsed, and here they axe at our doer, begging,
in humble tone for just ¡en millions more '
But let us look at the bill What is its tule? "A hill to carry
into effect the act of October, )t-37 " Now, sir, heie is decep
tion on the very face of the bill The hrst feature of the mta
sure is falveh od A bill to cany into effect the act nf October '
Why, sir, what wis the act of Octebei? It was a bill to autho
nze the is ue of ten m [lions of Ire-isury notes Well, sir
were not the notes 1 sued? "Ve?, sit evvry dollar, and wds not
that liw fulfilled? 1 \\i& comphte m itself, it proposed to do
a cert tin thing, which hi tig it did Ami now the^ put forth to
u^ a bill puiforiirg to Ci n v into effect ti e law of October'
It is deceptive in anothei íesppct It professrR to provide for
the i!"si e oí ly of notes 0 he a medium of paying and reemmg
the Government dues, wheieis its real f urpose ib to iuinish
to this nation a paper utculition—a paper currency ^ir, I
do not pjetendtobe much skilled in these matters lam no
financiei, I never, in my life, could rrake something ouj of no
thing, but this hard iru nay Administration propo&ea to pay us
debt** and supply acurre ey to the people, by engraving pro
mises in Line and red ink Instead of nithonzmg a loan of
money, ard with that moi-ey paying its rreduois, 11 proposes
to pay them m promis  s to pay Why this device'' Why not
boriow, as has been donebctoie? Can it oe that these wise and
able horneéis ai e ashamed of the condition into which they
\ ave brought us? Do they blush t  think that so soon aftn
their own boasting anl the puhhc joy over tne payment of the
national debt the peeple should discover that a new debt has
been created? That is the /art Disguise it at> ihey please,
there is a deficit in the Treasury, and a mw national debt must
bi'Cieatedtomeetit Sir, no portion of this responsibility rests
it rrty door I have opposed this whole course of measures
irom their inception It ¡i ti ue I did not inflict any speeches on
this House, beciuse 1 perceived that the subject was in «rood
hands, anl heaid 1 ably 11 d convjmmgfy debated by others
more nm peten t to do it jUa 1 c than I ctnpieiend tobe I con
t-mtfd myseli with voting But I ran di so no longer It has
become a duty to mvselfto place my own position fairly before
my constituents and the countr)
The act of October has n t only been can led info full off ct
the gnef is tint it h?s been too fully accomplished The ten
millions, which were to be received in piyment of the public
dues, have come back too soon The revenue pours m too

Admmistruion, with their rel and b'ue uniforms, will r ot

alas, tl eydie 1 \ei sir, not one of them ever returrs to tie

feelings of the friends of the \dinnisiraticn, and to put u for

which are to be realized, but these exposes of the expected re-
sources of the Government dffer so much from each other that
my tiust is greatly weakened m any óf them    Sir, what ("oes
the Treasury actually need-?   Must we grant them the whole of
these ten millions to relieve their necessity?   If so, let them say
so plainly, and I am ready to give ir, m any proper mode- and
form    Let them piesent us such a bill as I can consistently
and conscientiously vote for, and it shall have my prompt sup

the embaí rasamente of my Government   Let who will adimnie-
tit it, when it ¡s m need it shall hat e any and all the help I Caa
t-oufcistently lendei it    Sir, what is the reliance of the honora-
ble chairman, and his friend, the Sp^retary of the Treasury, for
the payment of these Treasury notes?   Their trust is on Wien
pet banks    Their reliance is on the twenty eight millions wh ch
have gone back t« the people of the S1 ate     Ah  sir, if that i&
then hope, they may look long for its coming    I strongly ens-
pect they will never behold that money coming into the Ti edsui y
to pay ihe^e Ireasuiy pioimaes    Sit  His one thins to give a
note and another thing to rmet it-    They have promised e n

they go on much longer increasing the national debt, the day is
not iar distant w hen ¡ ui faimerswil! have to p'oughonc furrow
Í01 themselves, and anothei foi the Government    I am opposed
to this indirect course of legislation    Let diem hono-ily ted us
how much they are behind hand, and I am ready to vote them
a loan for the amount      But, sir, 110 moie Treisury sotes     I
never vote fort kern, unless m an emerger cy, I nevei have vo e t
for them    The practice is unwarrantedand dangerous Whdf,
sir,iesort to Tteisury notes in a time of profound peare!    It
has never beep done     I know that, during a war, and HMoedi
ately after it in a great national crisis, this mt asure has been
ventured on, but only for the ehorte&t possible term, snd wren
that expned, the notes have been recalled with all ^peed    But
heie dre two emissions m less than a year     Sir, is it possihe
the Government is matuimg for us a new plan of currency,
which is to be carried whether we pass the bub Treasury biJi or
not?   Time will show    For myself, I am so utterly opposed to
the scheme, that I cannot vote even for the grant 01 two rmlliois
of Treasury notes, and a loan for the 1 a lanre      I am ready *br
a loan of the whole ten millions, and 1 am insured, on <.  j 1 au
thority, that the money can be obtained w 1 h éaí#, end m time
to meet the tmergency    I wdl \o efor that    I am re"dy to re-
lieve the Tieasury, that is  my desne , thatis ihedeeire of 'I e
people of my district   When the Government ism serif usd fh
culty, all party distinctions vanish, and the genuine A ireiu an.
feeling comes forth with piompf and efficient aíú    But they are
against this paper money.     You said that without 11 fe.esi it
would beat par with specie, you have put six per cen  infeiett
upon it, and it is depreciated notwithstanding    It is even below
th< | apei of non specie paying hanks      Yes   sir,   below that
isg money which ts here cried down in such terms of vitupe
íaiion    A iccent paper fiom the great money mart-et efiui

Yet you aie going to throw ten millions more of this sort of
money into the market I object to it It is not nececsai 1, the
(Government can obtain a sound currency wnh«m it, and why
l&otie a tra^h which is sure to depiecia'e and which cannot de
