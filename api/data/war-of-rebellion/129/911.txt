tion, equally honest, capable, and faithful - if I claim for the legislative and executive departments the same right to judge of their own powers that is exercised by the judiciary as to theirs. This is indispensable to preserve the equilibrium of the several departments - a matter of the last importance, as upon it depends the preservation of constitutional liberty, according to all writers upon free government.

My conclusions, then, are that the several departments have no right to define the political powers of each other; that political power is not of a judicial nature; that there is no authority in the Constitution or the laws which gives to the judiciary the right to define its own boundaries and those of the other branches of the Government; that whatever may be the necessity of having a tribunal clothed with such powers, none has been provided and cannot be provided by judicial construction; that the right on the part of the several departments to refuse to co-operate in the unconstitutional measures of each other, of which each has a equal right to judge, is eminently proper, healthful in action, and well calculated to preserve intact that division of powers guaranteed in the second article of the Constitution. That the Constitution contains no exception, confers no privilege, except "in consideration of public services; " that election to office does not protect any man against other duties, except so far as they may be in conflict with those to which he was elected; that, in the language of the court of appeals, "the obligation of the citizen to render military service is a paramount, social, and political duty," from which no man can be discharged, except on account of his civil duties, and only to the extent required by such duties; that military service "is a matter in which the whole body politic is interested; " that "the citizens have a right, collectively and individually, to the service of each other to avert any danger which may be menaced," of which they cannot lawfully and ought not to be deprived by any authority whatever. And I here, in the name of patriotism, of our manhood, of our dear old State, rent and torn by a vandal foe, and of our bleeding country, protest firmly, but respectfully, against the entire doctrine which would give to able-bodied men the legal right to walk aborad untouched amid the general suffering and desolation.

I have uniformly acted upon the principle that the State government had an inherent right of self-preservation, which involved the right to all the officers and employes of every description necessary thereto. I have never hesitated to claim all such persons, and to assert a right to judge for myself as to the necessity of such persons as against the Confederate Government. I understand this principle to have been broadly conceded by the act of Congress of the 17th of February, 1864. This act did not undertake to grant power to the Governors of the States, who could not accept power from such a source, even had such been the design of the act. But I repeat, I do not understand it to have had any such purpose in view. the certificate spoken of in the act was merely designed to obtain information of the Governors of the States of the persons claimed by the States as their officers and employes, and such certificates are very properly conceded by that act to be conclusive upon the Confederate authorities. Recognizing in the Confederate Government the right to the whole military power of the States, except to the extent of such persons as are necessary to the preservation of the State government and the execution of her laws, I have uniformly confined my certificates of exemption or claim to such persons as I regarded necessary therefor. In the case of justices of the peace I did not and do
