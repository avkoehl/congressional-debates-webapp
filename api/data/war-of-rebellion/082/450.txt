Commanding Second Brigade:

COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you detail two regiments of your brigade to relieve two regiments of General Gregg's command, now on picket duty. One of the above regiments is at Prince George Court-House, the other at McCann's place. The regiments detailed will march at once; they will be provided with three days' rations and forage, which may be sent after the regiments to save time.

I am, very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

The following dispatch has just been received from General Foster at Deep Bottom:

Two prisoners just captured from Humphreys' (Mississippi) brigade, of Kershaw's, formerly McLaws', division, report their division came to this place Saturday night. It consists of two Georgia brigades, one South Carolina brigade, and one Mississippi brigade, thus making seven brigades in my front. I have stirred them up, if nothing more. They came from Petersburg, they say, A. P. Hill having relieved Kershaw to-day of command of all the forces here.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Our signal officers report that the enemy in some force has just encamped on a hill three miles northwest of the Walthall house. This is beyond all doubt a force established as a reserve midway between our line here and Petersburg, and indicates that they are expecting an attack here.

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Foster reports an appearance of activity by the enemy in his front, not before noticed, slashing, &c. The slashing would show that the enemy was preparing for an attack there.
