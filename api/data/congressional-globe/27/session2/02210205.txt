CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr SSVTER did not believe that there was a necessity for a 1
Clerk, and he would oppose the motion Every time he came
here, he was followed by five or six applicants for clerkships,
who wanted something to live on During this session they
Jjad been importuvied morning after morning, to appoint a clerk
0& the Pension Committee, but ti e com Tint ee refused to ireet
the application, and if this matter should be investigated i no
doubt would be ascertained that the Senator had been annoyed
by some starving applieaiit foi a cleikship on the Committee on
Manufactures He would not consent to employ a cleik lo
write circulars to persone on one ííideonly ofth<* tariffque-uon,
attd he was sorry that the feeuatois fiom Mis«-ouu and Perm
eylvama (Messi* Linn and Rucha van) were eoing to vote for
a clerk out of courtesy He won! 1 not do it¡ and in raj mg thib
he meont no di^iesppct to his ñ if nd from Rhode Island
Mi HUNTINGTON was douy that the Senatoi fiomAr
kansis hadsa dthat tin tbject inarms foi a clerk was toena
blethe Committee on Manufacture  to prc&ent a one sided ob
ject, and he hoped that tne Senatoi did not attubute such an un
Worthy motivo to h s fi lend from Rho le lslar 1 \\ hen the ta
nfFquestion should come up ie would expíen his opinions
upon the subject, but, on the motion a«king fur a cteii, he
though' that the discuss on was unnecessary The simple
question i ow was not whethei tley would ahei onepunuple
connected With tariff, but merely to employ assistance toe able
the committee to ascertain a uniform home valuation on lo
reign goods He believed thai a clerk wa* wanted, ard
therefore he would sustain the motion of the Seimtai from
Khode Island
Mr S.LVÍER was \ety much astonished to hear t'ie
Senator from Connecticut speak about his impuMng im
proper motives to the committee, if he had done so, the
chairman would have responded to it He would not ask the
Senator to be a voiunteei irt this matter, as he had made no
allubion to unworhy motives, but he had opposed the ap
pomtment of a clerk, because he thought it to bo unneces
eary he committee had never hada clerk from detune
of itü origin, to the present time The chairman had as
much physical stiength and as much skill as anybody Lit
he would a&k Senatoiswhe her they un'erstood nun asimpu
ting unworthy motives to tii° chairman of the commit ee' fv jt
one would say that he did \\ uert he listened to the spe ch ot
the Senator, he attempted to analyse i , but he could not, and
all he could learn from h & reniuiks was that h hadaddies cd
an lnterrogatoiy to him as to the imputation of i nt ropei no-
Mr IIUNTINGTON observed (bat when he delivered his
few remarks he put no mterr^atoiy to the senator but had
merely said that he was son y that die Senator had spoken of a
one ¡bided object in asking for Jit appointment oí a cleii and
hoped that the Sena liirpmedno impropei motives O the
chairman of the comniHke Hi  íemarks weie befoiethe "se

(Mr Huntington) was not íespoi sible ioi that
Mr SEVIDit did not suppose that the Senator was, noi was
he(VIr Sjevier) respensible foi them, but if the benaiordid
not intend to discuss the tariff, why did he torture his (Mr Se
tier's) remarks
Mr HUNTINGTON said that he had done no such thing
' Mi MANGUM continued the debate He ro^e foi the pur
pose of replying toa remark made by the Senator fiom Mis
souri, [Mi LiMiil and the ¡senatoi from Arkansas, [Mi Sf
viER,]bothoi whom had named the Senator from Noith Cai
linaastheauthoi oí advoca eol a measuie which had increased
the clerks in the sei vice of the Government Mi M had ongi
nated no such object, and his support of it had passed almost
entirely from his memory He did, howevei, lemember of
having voted for abill to add some clerks to one of the Depart
menta And why was it doneí For what puipose? Hevoed
to raise the Department to a state of activity and uselulne ^,
which the negligence and extiavagance of the late Administra
tion had swamped
Mr M briefly commented upon the remarks which Sena
toia upon all sides of the Senate had made in refeience to
economy and extiavagance To iave hea\d these lemarls
one would suppose that senators m the oppositior hal had
no opportunity to retienen the e\peuditJies oí the Guvein
ment V  hy had they now moved foi the fir&t time m this
matter, and manifested no such ¿eal m leg^rd to economy
when they had the powei to do so in reality foi yeir* when
administering the affairs of the Gjveinmemi Gtitlemen
had hitheito stood by ard folded their aims, and thf>\ no\ ío&e
and talked of estimates, and accused him of extrav ^arce
when he had only a bored to lift the Post Office Department cut
of difficulties into which it had been plunged by the Adminis
tration Mi M then pledge 1 him elf it no uthei Senator
would move m this mattei to make an earnest of hi  ¡n entices
in íegard to economy by biingms m a bill to i educe the ex

Piesident dU not live tojgive them an opportunity of
showing the country how their discordant elements were to

one of their own^election He (Mr I i\n) had seen recently,
in the public papers, that the Tennessee Wln^s 1 ad deputed
