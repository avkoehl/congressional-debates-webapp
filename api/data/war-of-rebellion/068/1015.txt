General L. MCLAWS,

Burkeville Junction:

It is just reported the enemy's cavalry are making up beyond Big Nottoway River, toward Lunenburg Court-House, about 12 miles from Blacks and Whites when reported. This looks as if they were aiming at the bridge across the Staunton River, which must be protected, if possible, with any forces at command. Cavalry are said to be coming on. Perhaps a detachment might be stopped at or near that bridge until further orders. Notify, too, all local reserves to rally to it. The value of the bridge you will appreciate.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

LEWIS E. HARVIE,

Burkeville Junction:

Information of return of raiders toward Mattoax was a mistake communicated to Mr. Talcott by J. J. Reeves. They are really proceeding as if toward Staunton bridge. I have just had confirmation of this from Mr. Talcott. Be active and vigilant to prevent.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

LEWIS E. HARVIE,

Burkeville Junction:

I have just telegraphed General McLaws that report has been received of probable advance of enemy's cavalry from Blacks and Whites toward Staunton River. See my telegram to him. I recommend you to proceed at once to the river and take every measure in your power to protect the bridge.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE, May 17, 1864.

(Via Guiney's. Received 3.15 a. m. 18th.)

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

The enemy has made no demonstration against our position to-day. His army still lies in the valley of the Ny, extending across the road from this place to Fredericksburg. For some reason there seems to be a pause in his movements. The army received with joy the news of General Beauregard's success south of James River, as reported in the papers of to-day.

R. E. LEE.
