entiiely mistaken m these statements, and to allow
them to remain uncorrected would only continue to
obssure and mystify the subject
Por the better understanding of the subject, he
would read the passages alluded to. Mr K then
read the passages which follow
" However unwilling any oí our citizens may
heretofore have been to assign to these causes the
ch¿ef instrumentality in producing the present state
of things, the developments subsequently made,
and the actual condition of other commercial coun-
tries, must, as it seems to me, dispel all remaim lg
doubts upon the subject It has since appeared
that evils, similar to those sufTeied by ourselves,
have been experienced m Great Britain, on 'he
Continent, and, mdeed, throughout the commercial
world, and that m other counir es, as well as m our
own, they have been uniformly produced by an
undue enlargement of the boundaries of trade,
prompted, as with us, by unprecedented expansions
of the systems of credit 1 reference to the amount
of banking capital, and the issues of paper credits
put in circulation m Great Britain, by banks, and
in other ways, during the years 1834, 1835, and
1836, will show an augmentation of tne papei cur-
rency there, as much dispioportioned tc the rtal
wants of trade, as in the United States With this
redundancy of the papei cuirency, there arose ¡n
that country aho a spirit oí adventurous specula-
tion, embracing the whole range of human enter-
pnse Aid was profusely given to pi ejected im-
provements, large investments werem?de in fo-
reign stocks and loans, <redns for goods were
granted, with unbounded Jibeialilv, to merchants,
m foreign countries, and all the means oí acquir-
ing and emplo}ing credit weie put in active opera-
tion, and extended, in their effects, to every depart-
ment of business, and to every quarter of the globe
The reaction was proportioned in its violence to
the exlraordinaiy ch irarter of the even's which
preceded it Tin. coinmeK i il communny of Great
Britain were subjected tu the greatest diffic nllies,
and their debiois in this couniiy were not only
suddenly deprived of accusttmed and expected cre-
dits, but called upon for payments, which, m the
actual posture oí things heie, could only be made
through a general piessure, and at die met ruin-
ous sacrifices
" In view of these facts, i( w ould s^eiti impossi-
ble for sincere inquirers after truth to resist the
conviction, thit the causes of the revulsion in both
countries have been substantially the same Two
nations, the most commercial in the world, enjoy-
ing but recently the highest degi^e oí appaitnt
prosperity, and mamtainingwith each other the clos
est relations, are suddenly, in a time of profound
peace, and without any greit national disaster,
arrested m their caree), and plunged into a state ol
embairassment and distiess In both comitncswe
have witnessed the same redundancy of panel
money, and o her facilities of credit, the same spi-
rit of speculation, the same par tial successes, the
same difficulties and reverses, and, at length, neaily
the same overwhelming catastiophe The most
matenal difference betv een the itsults in the two
countries has only been, that, with us, there has
also occurred an extensive derangement in the fis-
cal affairs of the Federal and State Gov ímnents,
occasioned by the suspension of specie payments
by the banks "
Now, that ovcr-banl ing, overissuing &c as
mentioned bv the President, have been operating
causes, is only a common 1 elief But where did
they originals, and who produced them'' lint is
the fiist question And here Mr K stited tcvt
the Presideat was mistaken m eieiyfact assunud by
him to excu'pat? oui oion Governm ill fiom the chaige

United States " Nor has theie been in Lngland any
geneial ii*e of puce*, noi  do we witness  "m both
countries the spine redundancy of pa¡ =r money,
and otner facilities of credit," or the ' li.e same
spirit of speculat.on " These positions of the Pre-
sident are entirely eironeous, and the facts he sup-
poses have not a shadow of existence
He said he did not, of courst, make these contra-
dictions in an offensive sense, or ua way disre-
spectful to the President He had been in favor
oí his e'ection, and did not íegret it He more-
over bel eved him to be a man oí patriotism and
integrity, as well ?s intelligence, and he hoped to
be able to support his admmis ration But if he
was (as he was doubtless) a "sincere inquirer after
truth," he vvou'd be glad to be corrected in views
calculated to deceive the people, and divert their
minds from the true agency by which they have
been overnnelmed The Piesident's "difference,"
in fact, ought to have shown Inm where the fault
lay Ho states that one nation has become bank-
lupt The other sustained itself, and is now near-
ly recoveied Why this " difference'" Why,
simply because ouns is the dishes of the debtor un-
able to fay ihe debt, thi irs is the distress of the CRB-
ditoh tor want of the money due him The cre-
ditor of a bankiupt is frequently much imuied for
want of hismmey, but it docs not necessarily follow
that he al'-o fails A.nd in no case is he also charge-
ablewith the follies andextiavagances that brought
f bout the disastei He may have been too confiding,
but there his fault ends The injudicious prodigal,
with b-td advisers, may contract debt3, multiply
obligations, make experiments, and become em-
bairassed and baikrupt The confiding neighbor
who trusted him ton far, may feel s nsib'y the
want of his debt, be obliged to curtail his expenses,
or otherwise economize lor a wmle, but, being the
creditor, and therefore most likely the ricner of the
two, he is not so likely to te ruined [Here Mr
K read an extract oí a letter fiom a gentleman oi
Liverpool, stating th it "dure is no distress in Png-
land except that which grows out ot American con-
nections, and that is passing off though much of
the debt remains unpaid "] England, we are to'd
from all quarters, is now easy, and, with an abun-
dance of capital, prepared to make investments,
and engage m new enterprises Yet a mere check to
the lavish accommodations of the capitalist, by the em-
baí rasi ¡lent of his debtoi, is analogized u. ith the ut-
most conipfacenai to thepioshatc and helpless condition
of his bunkiupt debtor himself"
Those, he said, who insisted that the national
distreis could nrt have beui occasioned by the acts
of oui own Iveetilive, beciuse theie had been
some dis'itss in those conimeicial nations with
whom we track, put him in inud of that great
philosopher who stiii iped his toe in the darkness
of midnight, and railed out against the sun for not
shining m the night instead of the day, alleging, as
the result of his most profound observation, that
there vv as light enough in the day without htm
They confounded cause and consequence, aad lost
all connection betw een them, It nev cr occurred
to the philosopher that the sun might itselt be the
cause oí lisht, and these gentlemen cannot sec our
own agency in producing this embirrassment
ibto->d, though tic enc agency is just about as
plain as the othei
Mr K said he would try and remove the difti-
cul y i 1 those who felt so much embarrassment on
this si bject by proving—.
1    Tnat there had been no redundancy of the
cuirency n England bea/een 1834 and 1837, but
on the contraiy, the lalue of money dunng this peiio I
had gieally increased, by the mciease of national
■wealth whi'sl cunency lemained aboutstalionaiy
2   That there had been in England no niaonul
ove.-tiadmg, and that her exchanges had beei de-
pi ectated by icceiiiiig oui cied t in exchange for her
cash and commodities
3   That our extraordinaiy, but sjeculative de
nnnd for the products of Lnghsh labor had created
some acti/ity, especullv to the manulactun ■¡j, m
terests Our increased demand lor the p¡ educís of
the r labor, counteracting our unnatural ciedit de-
mand foi their money also, and, thereby only
maintaining p> ices which ouiern ise (so fai from a specu-
lative i ise) would have been d'pi ecialedby an apprecia-
tion ef money
These propositi! ns, Mr K   said, would rather
astonish those who had taken it for granted, without
inquiry, that, by some magical fatality the whole
world had been guilty of folly similar to our own,
and visited with similar punishment But if they
would take leave of mere assumptions, stump
speeches, party presses, and <agrant conjectures,
and be content with the plain evidence of their
senses, he thought he would maintain eveiv propo-
sition to the satisfaction of all who would hsten to
him
On the first proposition, let us see whether "a re-
ference to the amount of banking capital, &c m
Great Britain, during the years 1834, 1835, and
1836, will show an augmentation of papei currency
there as much disproportioned to the wants of trade
as -n the United Stales "
Mr K then read the following table, (prepared
from official statements)

pwate banks

The foregoing table is made from 'he February
manthly returns of the Bank of England, and the
December to March quarterly returns of the joint
stock and private banks, as being the most likely
way to approximate to tha aggregate for the month
of January The original official returns were
bef re him, Mr Kim- said, and were at the service
of any gentleman, and the monthly and tn-
monthly variation in the entirp circulation was so
trifling that it was scarcely worth naming It
would be seen, fiom the above table, that the entire
" augrae tation of paper currency" in England
during the vears 1834, 1835, and 1836, the period
mentioned by the President, was only ¿£323,000,
or about one-third of one per cent on the currency,
cstimatttK the whole currency of England at
¿f300,000,000, and the entire "augmentation"
uuring 1833 to 1836 inclusive, (commencing one
year earlier,) was only ¿£412,000, or ot quite one-
half of one pei cent on the whole currency, and
about one and a halt per cent on the paper circu-
lation Now let us see whether this increase is
" similar to our own," during the same period
Mr Ki\g then presented a statement, which he
believed to be as accurate as it could be made by a
collection and continuation of the íeturns of local
b~nks up to 1st January, 1837 It was more likely
to be an undei than an over estimate, fiom the
great d fliculty of finding new banks and getting
statements of their issues The following is the
statement
On ihe 1st of January m the follow mg y ears, the

By the above table, it will be seen that, when
we add the estimated amount of specie m 1834 and
1836 respectively, we find an augmentat on of the
entire currency of neaily nmctv foui per cent
and an augmentation of paper circulation of nearly
ninety-six per cent Our own entire currency,
then, "dunng the years 1834, 1835, and 1836,"
has increased nearlv ninety-four per cent and our
paper circulation, dunng the same period, nearly
ninety-six per ctnt, whilst the entire cunency of
England has mcieased about one-third ol one per
cent and her paper circulation, dmmg that period,
having fluctuated a mere trifle at any time, and
sometimes even contacted, is found, ?t the end of the
per od ment oned, to have increased only about
one and a half pei cent He had not given him-
self the tiouble to be very minute in the calcula-
