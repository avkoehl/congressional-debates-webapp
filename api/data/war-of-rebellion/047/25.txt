HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 22, 1863.

Brigadier General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding U. S. Forces, S. C., July 23, 1863.

GENERAL: Your letter of the 20th, in reply to mine of the 4th instant, has been received, and it only remains to add, in connection with the subject-matter of the correspondence, that I am quite at a loss to perceive the necessity for your remark that you "will expect from the commanding general opposed" to you "full compliance with the same rules and maxims in their unterstricted application to all the forces under my (your) command," inasmuch as I am wholly unaware that there has ever been alleged any departure on my part, or by any of my troops, from the established laws and usages of war between civilized people. I therefore submit that you should specify precisely to what you have referred.

As to the channel of communication resorted to in the transmission of my letter of the 4th instant, it need not have caused the surprise you express. Indeed, until made aware of your views, I had believed as it was clearly the one least calculated to interrupt your operations for the reduction of Battery Wagner, and I am quite unable to understand the grounds either of your surprise or of your objections. So far as I am concerned, be assured I shall avoid all provocation either of cavil or complaint, and do what I may to conduct the war upon principles recognized by other nations.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 22, 1863.

Brigadier General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Morris Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: On the morning of the 19th of July, while there was a suspension of hostilities under a flag of truce, on Morris Island, for the purpose of burying your dead, Private Thomas Green, Company H, First Regiment South Carolina [Regular] Infantry, deserted and entered your lines. To harbor and retain such a deserter is believed to clearly contrary to settled usages of war, and therefore I have to ask that he may be delivered up at your earliest convenience to the commanding officer of the Confederate States forces on Morris Island.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
