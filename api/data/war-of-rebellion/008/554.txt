battery and a train of supplies arrived yesterday. General Van Dorn was expected, but had not yet arrived, and I do not therefore believe his force is very near, for I think at such a time he would most likely come a few days before his force .

I send you abstract of my effective force here, which foots up a follows:

Cavalry........................................... 2,510

12,095

Artillery (including four mountain howitzers), fifty pieces.

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,

Major General D. HUNTER,

Commanding Dept. of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

GENERAL: Your very kind letter of the 8th is this moment received.* I must write you a very hasty answer to-day. You are entirely mistaken about my having received any information, official or unofficial, from Washington about the "great jayhawking expedition." Not a word or hint has been communicated to me.
