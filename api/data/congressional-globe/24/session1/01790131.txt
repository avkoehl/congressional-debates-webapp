bihty to the wrongs w hich our country was en-
durirsr from France, and if upon those Journals
such a trace can be found, it must be by clearer
ard more searching eyes than mine.
Then why are we told, that nobody knew any-
thing of the reasons of the House for ndoptingthat
amendment to the fortification bill' Nothing
passed in the House but what was known in the
other poition of the Capitol, Nothing was to be
found on the Journals of the other body, that
would go to sustain the Executive and the coun-
try In anotherbody there were resolutions passed
veiy explicitly declaring that they would not do
what the Executive recommended, but no resolu-
tions were passed saying what they would do, A
different course of policy was pursued by the
House It adopted unanimous resolutions, and
■showed that, although the measures recommended
by the President did not entirely meet their appro-
bation v et, that the rights of the country and the
"execution of the treaty were to be insisted on In
another branch of the Capitol, at the same time, it
was not known what the House were doing, yet
Í17 names answering "yea," stood recorded on
the Journals of this House These were the facts,
and an impartial history of that bill would show,
that there was sufficient and ample cause for the
■appropriation of three millions. But the three
million appropriation was received by the Senate
in a most unfortunate temper, and as proof of this
i' became absolutely necessary for him to refer to
their p.oceedings. In the first place, the motion
for the three million section was submitted in the
House, and little objection was made to it. It was
perfectly understood by gentlemen on both sides
of the House, that it was founded on the vote of
the night preceding, and no one, so far as he
recollected, objected to it because there was no
recommendation from the Executive, The votes
were taken on it by yeas and nays, and it was
adopted. One hundred and nine names, (said Mr.
Adams,) the first of which in alphabetical order
was my own, are recorded upon the Journals in
favor of that amendment, and of those names,
seventy-two belong to members of this House,
seventy-seven names appear on the Journal re-
rorded against the amendment, forty-five of which
lire of members of this House. The proportion
Df relected members is rather larger of the names
in the affirmative, than of those in the negative
8ut, 1 have said the amendment was received by
the Senate in a bad temper, and now for the proof
The resolution as recorded on the Journals of the
House w as as follows ;
" And be it Í, c , T.iat the -.11111 of $3,000,000 be, and the

Observe what were the puiposes of the appro-
puat on Was the House wasting and squan-
dering the public money, when it made that ap-
propriation   No, sir Shall it be said that the
appropriation, if made, must have been wasted >
When an enemy is at the walls of the Capitol,
it w ill be but a son y objection to make, that you
have no confidence in the man at the head of the
Government, He hoped that the matter might
be fully exposed and whatever might bo his ri la-
tions wuh the head of the Government, he did
not think that that v oto would }ye cliargi d to man-
\v 01 ship Upon that resolution, one hundn d anil
nine names were recorded 11 the sfni motive, and
v ere the.e one hundred and nine members ti be
■charged with be ng man-worshipers and cou-
sp ratois against the Const tution of their coun-
try > Among these names were several, if they
vwrc capable of anything like man worship',
(whu ¡1 he did not believe,) the object of whose
worship would b some other than the present
tenant of the White House evinth veiym nwho
no* made these charges agenist them He said,
that tin -ec'ion was íeccived 111 bad temper by the
Smate They immediately disagi^ed to the amend
m-mt, it was said, with little tie bate, and sent then
disasreement dow n to the House Ho recollected
thai the present Speaker, who was thfn chairman
of t 1 Committei of Ways and Means, did him
th< 'íonor to ask him what w e should do, and h
(Mr. A.) said he should vote to recede from the
appropriation, because fiom the temper of the
Senate it was evident,if that couise was not pur-
sued, the whole bill would be lost Mi A said
he did, accordmsly, vote to recede, but it was
not to recall the vote he had before given, it was
solely because he believed that, if the House did
not recede, the whole bill would be lost. As the
object of the bill was for the ordinary appropri-
ations for fortifications, he was unwilling to lose
it, and therefore gave up the three million appro-
priation to save the remainder of the bill But it
was not the sense of the House to recede, and the
vote to recede stood 87 to 110. The sense of the
House was strong; it was earnest, but it was re-
spectful How was it with the Senate > The next
communication which the House received from it
was, that the Senate had adhered to their disagree-
ment. In the intercourse between the tw o Houses
every person knew that adhering was the very last
resoit—that it scaiccly ever was íecuired to ex-
cept as a challenge cf defiance to the other House
What are its consequences' They are always
to hazard the loss of the whole bill; if the other
House adhere, the bill is lost The Senate said,
'' Take back y our appropriation ,or lose your bill,"
and that at the earliest stage at w hich they could
pass such a vote. It was well known to every
man that the vote to adhere never passes between
the two Houses in good temper It was always
considered as a challenge, " Lose your bill, or
agree to whit we think will we right." Mr A.
here read the following extract from Jefferson's
Manual, in support of his views:
" When either House send  a bill to the o'her, the other
may pa  it with amendment    'I he regular progres-ioii in
this case 1 , the Common* disagree to the intendment, th„
Lord  insist upon it   the Common, in-i,ton tl  ir i!i i;rree
ment, the Lords adhere to their aui"ml-nent, the Com
moo  adhere to their disagreement    The term ot insisting
may be repeated as olten as they choose, to keep the (]ues
tion open     But the first adherence  bv either render  u
necessary for the other sid ■ to recede or adhere al o, u litn
the matter is usually suffered to fall    The term 01 insisting
was certainly (in 1679) a happy innovation, as u multiplies
the opportunities ot trying modification* which may bring
the Houses to a concurrence     Either House, however, is I
free to pass over the term of insisting and to adhere n the
fir&t instance, ut T it is not respectfdi to thf othf r " ¡
Mr A said he doubted w hether, in the whole
intercourse between the twoHouses of Congress,
an adherence was ever befoie resorted to at so
early a stage of a difference between them. He
I was sure there never had been such an instance
unless at a time of badtemperbetween the Houses.
It was a special disposition to cast odium upon I
the House, a special bravado that induced the
Senate thus to draw the sword and throw away I
the scibbard,and they adhered. Notwithstand-
ing, the natural feeling was, when the bill came to I
the House, to adheie on then p irt, and that mo-
tion was nc'ually mide, y<,t so anxious was the
House to save the bill tint they did not adhere,
neither did they reced" they insisted again, and
asked of the Senate a conference, to which the 1
Senate agreed, although at that time the houi was j
twelve in real time That clock, (pouting to
the clock in the Hall,) to be sure, so far as a clock
could show, said it was not twelve, but it was not
possessed of the power of Joshua of old, who
commanded the sun and moon to stand still, old
Time submitted to no such power, but moved
along regardless of w nat was doing here The
comniitu < of confuenre of the House wentout,
and that committee f< It themselves constiamed to
const nt to a reduction of the $3,000,000 down
to s,8-J0,t)00
Thus, sn, this horrible conspiracy against the
Constitution melted down to a mere question of
dolhrs and cents—vvhctln r the appropriation
should be $3,000,000 or $SJ0,000 The appro-
priation was midi pos tive instead of being con-
tinent upon a ivctfesity not certain to come, and
it w es confined to two objects of permanent 01 di-
n 11 v appropriation, still 1 av ng th( possible con-
tinent danger unprovidi d for He hid said,
and belli v<d, that the ronfei es on the p,<it of
the Hoe se had been constipmcd to accept this
compromise fe r the purpose of saving the bill,
but it w as too late when the conferees on the
part of the House letuncd, that House was no
more—it w s a hfi less 1 o--pse A fuend and col-
1 igue of his, now 111 his eye, had indei d said it
was the noisust dead bodv that he had evei seen
orliPTil ot     That  vas true, vet it was, never-
theless, true the House was de facto dead    The
Journal shows that from that time it was impossible
to make a quorum    It was a few minutes before
that a large quorum was found.   He said this
because, 111 the National Intelligencer, the exem-
plary assiduity of the members of the Senate, in
the discharge of their duties, was invidiously con-
trasted with the insinuated neglect of the members
of the House, where it was insinuated that busi-
ness could not be done for want of a quorum.
But why was the House found without a quorum •
Because sixty or seventy membei s, conscientious-
ly believing that they were no longei the Rep-
íesentatives of the people, refused or forboie to
answer to their names    Your Journals will show
that motion after motion was made to that effect.
Many  members  declined   answering   on  these
grounds, and no motion was made to eomtelthem
to vote as by the rules of the House, had it still
existed, there would have been     He was not one
of those w ho believed that the ¡session ended at
midnight     In his opinion the two years' duration
of Congress was from the time of day at which
the House commenced its session—say to the
hour of noon on the 4th of March     He bcliev ed
that to be the tiue construetion of the constitu-
tional term of two years, but it was a constitu-
tional question, and it was not for him to judge
of the motives of men who conscientiously be-
lieved that the period of their political existence
had expired.     When the Cumberland road bill
passed, the question was taken by yeas and nays,
and the vote was 94 to 80, making 174 votes   Here
was a quoiura voting, which showed that the
House, at twelve o'clock, was doing business,
but in ten minutes  after no quorum could   be
found—not in consequence of there not  being
members piesent, but in consequence of their
conscientious scruples      He lecollected the in-
stance of a gentleman from Geoigia, [Mr   Gil-
mer,] a man as conscientious and as intelligent as
any member of that oi the piesent House who,
upon being called, íefused to answer, and gave
as his reason, that he was no longer a Represent-
ative of the people, and immediately after the
vote was taken went out of the House at that
door and never returned     It was not, therefore,
the w ant of a sufficient number of members pres-
ent, but from the conscientious conviction of ro
large a number of the members as reduced the
remainder to less than a quorum, that they had
no right to vote on anything m the House     After
that took place, the committee of conference re-
turned to the House, but no report was made,
and what was the reason J   Because there was no
House     The roll was called, and no quorum was
to be found
He said that he did not consider the constitu-
tional tcim of two years, assigned to the members
of the House of Representatives, and the tenn of
four years, during which the President of the
United States ho'ds his ofTce, commences or ex-
pires at midnight The services of two, and o."
four years commenced running from the time w hen
the members of the first Congress assembled to
commence the operations of this Government
under the Constitution of the United States, w hich
was on the 4th of March, 1189, at noon The two
years from that time expired, not on the 3d of
March, 1791, at midnight, but on the 4th of March,
at noon The expnation of a yen is not from
noon to midnight, but from noon to noon It is
so, astronomically, by the law of nature The
time at which a day snail commence and tei mín-
ate is a matter altogether aibitrary and conven-
tional. Some nations have in their civil compu-
tation commenced the day at sunnse, and some
at sunset—some at midnight, and some at noon.
Astronomers and navigators always reckon the
day fiom noon to noon, and why should not the
constitutional computationof time follow thesame
law, which is tbe law of nature' The piuiciplc
once established could be attended with no s<,it
of inconvenience, whereas the computation fiom
noon to midnight must be subject once eve  y two
years to asolu ion of continuity for twelve hours
by the non-existence of a House of Representa-
tives, and once in every four jears, to an inter-
regnum or vacancy in the office of President of
the United States Emergencies mia;ht easily be
fore;secn, perhaps even precontuved, in which
either of those events wpuld be attended wi'h ve-y
