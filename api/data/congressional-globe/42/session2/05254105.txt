MESSAGE FROM TIIE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Represent-
atives, by Mr. McPherson, its Clerk, an-
nounced that the House had non-concurred in
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.

Lake Michigan Railroad Company the lands
heretofore granted to the State of Michigan to
aid in the construction of a railroad from
Grand Haven to Flint, and thence to Port
Huron, and providing for the manner of issu-
ing patents therefor, and for other purposes,
asked a conference on the disagreeing votes
of the two Houses thereon, and had appointed

R. McCormice, of Missouri managers at the
same on its part.
EN ROLLED BILLS SIGNED.

of the House had signed the following enrolled
bills ; and they were thereupon signed by the
Vice President:
A bill (H. R. No. 2192) to establish a west-
ern judicial district of North Carolina; and
A bill (H. R. No. 2938) granting right of

PORT HURON AND LAKE MICHIGAN RAILWAY.
The Senate proceeded to consider its amend-

State of Michigan to aid in the construction
of a railroad from Grand Haven to Flint, and
thence to Port Huron, and providing for the
manner of issuing patents therefor, and for
other purposes, disagreed to by the House of
Representatives.
On motion by Mr. FERRY, of Michigan, it
was
Revolved, That the Senate insist upon its amend-
ments to the said bill disagreed to by the House of
Repiesentatives, and agree to the conference asked
by the House on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses thereon.
Ordered, That the conferees on the part of the

BRITISH CASE AT GENEVA.
Mr. ANTHONY. I am instructed by the
Committee on Printing to report back two
resolutions with amendments. These are
the same that my colleague [Mr. Sprague]
objected to the other morning. Is the objec-
tion withdrawn?
Mr. SPRAGUE. I simply desired to record
my objection.
Mr. ANTHONY. Then I report with an
amendment the House resolution relative to
printing the British case.
The amendment of the Committee on Print-
ing was to strike out all after the words " that
there be printed" in the House resolution and
insert:
Three thousand copies of the case presented on
the partof theGovernment of her Britannic Majesty
to the tribunal of arbitration constituted under
article one of the treaty concluded at Washington
on the 8th of May, 1871. between her Britannic
Majesty and the United States of America! one
thousand copies of which shall be for the use of the
Senate, and two thousand copies for the use of the
House.
Tkeamendmentwas agreed to; and the reso-
lution, as amended, was concurred in.
BRITISH COUNTER CASE.
Mr. ANTHONY. I am also instructed by
the Committee on Printing to report the
House resolution as to the British counter
case, with an amendment.
The amendment was to strike out all after
the words "that there be printed," in the
first and second lines of the resolution of the
House, and insert:
Three thousand copies of the message of the
President of April 26. 1872, transmitting, in answer
to a resolutioti of the House of Representatives, the
British counter case under the treaty of Washing-
ton, with an accompanying appendix, onethousand
copies of which shall be for the use of the Senate,
and two thousand copies for the use of the House of
Representatives.
The amendment was agreed to ; and the
resolution, as amended, was concurred in.
KU KLUX ACT.
Mr. ANTHONY. I reported a resolution
the other day, that was objected to by some
Senator, for printing additional copies of the
President's message in regard to the employ-
ment of authority under the so-called Ku
Klux law. I should like to have that
now if there is no objection.
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to that resolution being acted on now 1
Mr. SAULSBURY. I do not see the
necessity of publishing so many copies of that
document. I do not see the object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Delaware objects.
Mr. ANTHONY. Will not the Senator
from Delaware allow it to be disposed of, and
let us print a less number of copies than the
House proposed ?
Mr. SAULSBURY. I think the whole thing
is wrong. Everybody knows that there is no
necessity for it. The reports of the Ku Klux
committee have been printed and published,
and what is the use now of publishing the
President's message in reference to the same
subject?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair must
ask the Senator from Delaware to suspend.
The matter is not before the Senate, and is
not debatable.
Mr. ANTHONY. I give notice that when
the proper time comes I will move to take up
that resolution.
SURGICAL HISTORY OF TIIE WAR.
Mr. ANTHONY, from the Committee on
Printing, reported a bill (S. No. 1182) for the
completion and publication of the Medical and
Surgical History of the Rebellion.
Mr. ANTHONY. This bill was explained
a few days ago when I first presented it, but
it was then withdrawn. I ask that it be now
acted on.
By unanimous consent, the bill was read
three times, and passed. It directs the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to have completed the
Medical and Surgical History of the War by
the preparation in the office of the Surgeon
General of two volumes of eighteen hundred
pages, in addition to the first volume already
compiled and printed under authority of Con-
gress ; and he is authorized to have executed
as he may deem advisable and necessary
engraving and lithographing therefor at an
expense not exceeding $00,000. Five thou-
sand copies each of the second and third vol-
umes are to be printed and bound by the Con-
gressional Printer, to be distributed with the
first volume already printed as may be here-
after directed by Congress.
SALES OF ARMS.
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe the Senator
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Sumner.,] and the
Senator from Maine, [Mr. Hamlijt,] who I
understand has been called home on a very
sad errand, wished to be present when the
report was made on printing extra copies of
the arms and sales report. I wish to accom-
modate the Senators.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator can make
the report, and then it will be for the Senate
to determine.
Mr. ANTHONY. I would not like to ask
for its present consideration.
Mr. SUMNER. No, I should not wish its
present consideration, except with a view to
assigning a time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from Rhode Island will suspend for a few
minutes, there are some reports to be made,
one a conference report on the postal code
bill, which bill it will take some time to enroll.
Mr. ANTHONY. Very well.
WITHDRAWAL OF PAPERS.
On motion of Mr. HILL, it was
Ordered, That G. W. Lyons, of Georgia, have leave
to withdraw from the Committee on Claims all
papers appertaining to his claim for cotton seized
after June 30,18G5, and that the said committee be
discharged from the further consideration of the
subject.
