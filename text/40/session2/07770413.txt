1S68.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

the 1st of January, 1868. I am seeking light. |
I desire simply to be informed, fori have been :
misled by the statement from the Department
it' I am not correct. Do I understand the Sena-
tor to say that in this statement of " United
States notes $35(1,159,127" and "amount in
the Treasury, currency, $25,770,349 71'' the
$25,770,349 must be deducted from the
$856,159,127, or that it must be added to it,
to show the entire greenback circulation now
outstanding ?
Mr. EDMUNDS. I intend to say that, if I
understand this statement, the §350,000,000
does not embrace the $25,000,000 which are
stated below.
Mr. HENDERSON. The Senator is simply
mistaken. His correction of me certainly
will not stand good, because there are but
$35(3,000,000 of United States notes now out-
standing, whether in the United States Treas-
ury or anybody else's treasury.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That remains to be
determined. It appears in the way in which
the statement is made up, as this statement
appears on the face of it, the amount of cur-
rency in the Treasury is treated as cash repre-
senting just so much money, to diminish the
amount of actual liabilities of the Government
over and above its resources. It may be that
my suggested explanation is an error, because
it may be the actual fact in the Treasury is the
other way; but speaking from these papers
that would appear so to me.
Mr. HENDERSON. I should like to ask
the Senator, then, of what this currency item
consists. Is it greenbacks, or what is it?
Mr. EDMUNDS. I suppose It is everything
which is lawful money, which the Treasurer of
the United States or any receiving officer is
entitled to receive.
Mr. HENDERSON. Then, of course, it
destroys the Senator's correction of myself,
because if there are $356,000,000 outstanding
it will neither do to add or subtract the
$25,000,000, because it may consist of some-
thing else than greenbacks.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The amount authorized
to be issued by law is $400,000,000, which
may be outstanding. That is the limit. Now,
then, I understand this statement to mean that
the Secretary of the Treasury has outstanding
out of the Treasury so much; he has in the
Treasury so much, making the total amount
of United States currency which may not be
used passing in and out of the Treasury
$356,000,000 plus the $25,000,000, making
$381,000,000.
Mr. HENDERSON. I may be mistaken.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I may be; but that is
the way it occurs to me.
Mr. HENDERSON. This $25,000,000 may
consist of national bank notes.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Certainly, and part of it
does, undoubtedly.
Mr. HENDERSON*. Then there can be
but $356,000,000 of greenbacks uncanceled on
the 1st of January, 1868.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I do not see the conse-
quence stated by the Senator.
Mr. HENDERSON. That must be so ; or
else how is the Senator to arrive at anything'
like a correct statement as to the amount of
greenback circulation outstanding at any par-
ticular time? It means simply that it is that
amount of United States notes uncanceled,
and it may be in the Treasury of the United
States. There may be a large quantity of it
in the sub-Treasury, at New York ; there may
be a large quantity of it in the sub-Treasury at
St. Louis ; it may be at Burlington ; it may be
at different parts of the United States: but it is
not for the Secretary of the Treasury to deter-
mine where it is or where it is not. It is easy
for him to determine the amount of United
States notes uncanceled, and that is what he
reports to us.
Mr. EDM UNDS. The object of these state-
ments is to show the public from month to
month how we stand, just as a banker or busi-
ness man'would want to know how he stood ;
and in order to do that the Secretary shows us
how much he owes, and how much money,
that is, lawful money, coin and currency, he
has to diminish the apparent amount of the
debit side of his balance-sheet ledger with, and
therefore he states all that is outstanding that
he is liable to pay, and gives us all he has got
in the Treasury that he is lawfully author-
ized to pay with. Therefore, although this
$25,000,000 is undoubtedly composed in part
of national bank notes and whatever else is
lawful currency, he may state it in that way in
order to show what his resources are.
Mr. HENDERSON. The Senate, I sup-
pose, will understand the position assumed by
us both. I think the Senator is mistaken.
However, I may be.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It is very possible I am.
Mr. HENDERSON. But suppose I am
mistaken in regard to the greenback or United
States note circulation: 1 next come to the
proposition that the contraction of the cur-
rency does not come from this point. The
great contraction of the currency comes from
another point of view entirely, and that is the
funding or the payment of the compound-
interest notes, if I understand" it properly. If
gentlemen will tnrn to this statement they will
find that on the 1st day of March, 1867—the day
before the passage of the act of March 2,1867,
which I have re%d—there was $141,000,000
of compound-interest notes outstanding ; April
1, 1867,$)39,000.000—I use round numbers—
May 1, 1867, $134,000,000, a contraction of
$5,000,000; Junel, 1867, $130,000,000, a con-
traction of $4,000,000; July 1, 1867, $122,-
000,000, a contraction of $8,000,000 more ;
August 1, 1867, $114,000,000, a contraction
of $8,000,000 more; September 1, 1867,
$91,000,000, a contraction of $23,000,000 in
one single month. I say " a contraction."
It ia a contraction simply becaHse it renders
the national banks less able to keep out their
own circulation and forces them to the neces-
sity of calling in their discount line and col-
lecting from their customers that amount of
money. It forces them, of course, to put
themselves in line, as bankers term it. There-
fore the mere withdrawal oi the compound-
interest notes, with nothing else outstanding to
be held as a reserve, forces a contraction upon
the national banks, just as a loss of coin in a
bank forces the bank to a contraction in order
to get into line. Now, here is a contraction
of $23,000,000 from the 1st day of August to
the 1st day of September, 1867. Up to the
1st of October there is another contraction
of $5,000,000, the amount having been reduced
to $86,000,000. On the lst of November there
is a contraction of $15,000,000 on this line
again, leaving the amount $71,000,000; and
on the 1st of December, 1807, there was a fur-
ther contraction of $2,000,000, leaving the
amount $69,000,000.
Now, Mr. President, what was there to
relieve that thing? On the 2d of March, 1867,
the provision was passed allowing the three
per cent, certificates to be substituted and held
by the banks as a reserve. Did the Secretary
nse that authority? He certainly did not until
November 1, 1867, because no three per cents,
were issued until during the month of October.
There .were never any reported until Novem-
ber IT 1867, and then he reported $11,560,000.
Notwithstanding all this contraction at the
rate of from fifteen million to twenty-three
million dollars a month in compound-interest
notes, which enabled the banks, of course, to
keep their circulation out, none of the three
per cents, were issued until the month of
October, because on the 1st of November,
1867, we have $11,560,000 reported, and De-
cember 1, 1867, $12,855,000. My friend from
Ohio says there are $23,000,000 out. I did
not look at the last statement. The statement
for January 1, 1808, has been handed me, and
I see the Senator from Ohio is correct, because
between December 1, 1867, and January 1,
18C8, there has been an issue of nearly eleven
million dollars more. 'Uhere is $23,266,000
out now, and on the 1st of December, 1867,
there was $12,855,000. It is that contraction
of which the people, in my section of the conn--
try, at any rate, complain. That is really the
contraction.
One word more, Mr. President, and I have
done. Our public debt was created with a
circulating medium rising one thousand mil-
lion dollars. A large portion of the bonds
were floated and sold at par. We did not want
to sell them beneath par, but we floated them
on a circulation of from one thousand million
to twelve thousand million dollars. We passed
laws declaring that we would not carry on the
war with gold or the representative of gold,
but we would adopt what we called a legal
tender, and compel the creditors of the Gov-
ernment to take it. The soldier was paid in
it. We had agreed to pay the soldier in coin,
I suppose, if we agreed to pay anybody in coin.
We agreed to pay him in what was known as
the dollar prior to 1862. We paid him off,
however, in the dollar fixed by the acts of
1862, 1863, and 1864. In order to keep our
bonds at par we floated them up just as we
would put a canal-boat through locks. We
run into the first lock, and we must have water
enough to raise it to the second lock. We
found a difficulty in floating our bonds. We
wanted to get up into the second lock. We
first issued $150,000,000 of greenbacks. That
was not satisfactory. We issued $150,000,000
more, and then $100,000,000, making $400,-
000,000, or rather authorized it, and issued
very nearly that amount. We were not satis-
fied with that. We issued hundreds of mil-
lions of six percent, compound-interestnotes.
We were not satisfied with that. We issaed
what we called, not United States notes, be-
cause those are the greenbacks, but we issued
what were called Treasury notes, bearing in-
terest. All these went into the circulation. A
great many of our bonds were bought by indi-
viduals at from forty to fifty cents on the dollar
in gold, and we all know it. There is not a
man in the country anywhere who does not
know it. The debt was contracted with this
bloated state of affairs. .
Now, the very moment the war is over every-
body looks to a resumption of specie payments.
I want to come to it, too. We have now tft
bring our canal-boat down the locks, and gen-
tlemen will not permit us to let the water in
the lock, but we must butt it down and destroy
the boat. Sir, we went up by taking time and
letting the water into the lock. Now let us
come down in the same way, and thereby pre-
serve the boat. If we undertake to come down
otherwise we shall destroy the vessel.
Mr. EDMUNDS. We shall not come down
by letting water into the lock. We must pour
it out.
Mr. HENDERSON. I may not understand
canal-boating as well as my friend. I believe
we have no canals in my State; but I under-
take to say it would be well to leave the water
in the lock and not draw it out before the boat
comes upon it.
I may be allowed, perhaps, another illustra-
tion. However, 1 cannot speak personally on
that subject any more than I can in reference
to locks and canals. I have but little experi-
ence on either of these subjects. It seems to
me that to undertake to drive the country in
this state of affairs to a resumption of specie
payments by contraction is about as reasonable
as it would be for a physician who should call
upon a poor patient who had been laboring for
some considerable length of time under delirium
tremens to recommend that his liquor be stopped
instantly. The man has kept himself excited,
perhaps, for three or four months with spirituous
liquors. The country, recollect, was excited
during the whole period of the war. We kept
pouring in this stimulant of paper money ; and
why? To float the bonds. We did not want
to sell them below par. We refused to sell our
bonds at forty cents on the dollar in gold and
carry the war on in money, as Napoleon did
when he got rid of the paper money of France ;
but we resolved to keep our bonds at par, and
to issue paper money enough to drive them up
to par. Hence it was that the country laborea
