Lieutenant-Colonel Read, chief of artillery, lost left arm. Southerland's battery: 1 man slightly wounded.

a Captured at Battery Anderson.

No. 29. Report of Lieutenant Colonel John P. W. Read, C. S. Artillery, commanding Light Artillery.

WAY HOSPITAL, NO.5, Wilmington, N. C., December 29, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward to you the report of the action taken with the light artillery of this department ordered to the neighborhood of Sugar Loaf on the morning of the 25th instant. One 32-pounder gun was stationed in Battery Gatlin with a detachment of men who were ordered to annoy the enemy should he attempt a landing and then fall back across the ford and rejoin their command. This was done because I believed Battery Gatlin to be a trap, and it was impossible for me to remove this heavy gun. I had previously requested its removal. One section of Captain Southerland's battery was placed in position in work that had been thrown up some months ago to prevent a landing and the crossing of the sound of the ford. One section of Captain Southerland's battery was placed in position to prevent a landing at or near an unfinished work called Ramseur. One section of Captain Southerland's battery and one Whitworth gun of Captain Paris' battery were held in reserve at Sugar Loaf.

About 11 o'clock on the morning of the 25th instant the enemy commenced a heavy shelling from their gun-boats upon a neck of land extending from Battery Ramseur some distance above Sugar Loaf. About 1 o'clock I saw indications that led me to believe that a landing was about to take place near Fort Gatlin. I placed the guns which I had in reserve in an excellent position almost entirely protected from the enemy's shot and ordered a 6 and 12-pounder Whitworth to open upon
