objection.
Mr. MORTON. I am unanimously instructed [
by the Committee on Foreign Relations to re-
port back the bill (S. No. 8(38) making it a mis-

district, or colony who are in a state of armed
insurrection against such foreign prince or

sage of an act for the payment of his salary
while discharging the duties of the office, have
had the same under consideration and directed
ine to report it back with a recommendation
that it be indefinitely postponed, and I ask to
have the question taken now.

dissent it will be indefinitely postponed ; and
it is so ordered.

taxation certain legacies to the Taylor Orphan
A?ylum, in Wisconsin, asked to be discharged
from their further consideration.
Mr. BAYARD. I am likewise instructed
by the same committee to report a bill for the
relief of public charities from taxation, in the
nature of a substitute by way of a general law
for these bills.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The two bills
first reported will be indefinitely postponed;
and the new bill reported will be read by its
title.
The bill (S. No. 637) to relieve public chari-
ties from taxation was read, and passed to a
second reading.
Mr. TRUMBULL, from the Committee on
the Judiciary, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. 491) relating to the supreme court of
tlie District of Columbia, reported it without
amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I am directed by the
same committee, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. 522) supplementary to an act to reor-
ganize the courts of the District of Columbia,
a d for other purposes, approved March 8,
1S03, to report it back and recommend its
indefinite postponement, the matter being cov-
ered by the other bill.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. ANTHONY. I am instructed by the
selectCommittee on the Revision of the Rules,
to whom was referred a resolution offered by
the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Pomeroy] for
tlxeameudment of the rules, toreportan amend-
ment to it; and I ask to have it printed.
Mr. POMEROY. I should like to have that

hope to get action on it to morrow.

: printed. .
Mr. RAMSEY. Some days since I intro-
duced a bill (S. No. 573) for the relief of Joseph
D. Smith, receiver of public moneys, which
; was erroneously referred to the Committee on
Claims. I think it ought to be referred to the
Committee on Public Lands. I move that the
first committee be discharged from its further
consideration, and that it be referred to the
Committee on Public Lands.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WILLEY asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to-introduce a bill (S. No.
042) granting a pension to Riley H. Smith;
which was read twice by its title, referred to
the Committee on Pensions, and ordered to be

purpose of subdividing the public domain in
certain States into forty-acre tracts for home-
stead purposes for the colored race; which was
read twice by its title, referred to the Commit-
tee on Public Lands, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. WILLIAMS asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint
resolution (S. R. No. 147) to provide for the
redemption of the legal-tender notes of the
United States; which was read twice by its
title.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I ask that the joint reso-
lution be read at length.
The Secretary read as follows :
Resolved, &c.% That from and after the passage of
this resolution all payments to the United States on
account of duties for imports maybe made, to tho
amount of one half of oach payment, in the legal-
tender notes of the United States.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I move that the joint
resolution be referred to the Committee on
Finance and printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a joint reso-
lution (S. R. No. 148) for the relief of David
T. Jackson ; which was read twice by its title;
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs,
and ordered to be printed.
He also asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a joint resolu-
tion (S. 11. No. 149) for the temporary relief
of the poor of the District of Columbia; which
was read twice by its title; referred to the
Committee on the District of Columbia;and

Mr. ANTHONY asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a joint
resolution (S. R. No. 150) to transfer an appro-
priation for the public printing: which was read
j twice by its title.
Mr. ANTHONY. As the resolution is very
short I ask to have it read at length.
The Secretary read the joint resolution, as
follows:
Resolved, &câ€ž That tho Secretary of the Treasury
bo authorized and directed to transfer from the paper
land "underappropriationsforpriuting and binding
for tho year 1839," as follows: for public printing,
890,000; for public binding, $60,000.
Air. ANTHONY. This resolution makes
no appropriation, but transfers appropriations
from one branch of the same service to another;
and as the fund of the branches to which the
transfer is proposed to be made is exhausted
it is necessary for the public service that it
should be done at once. X presume there can
be no objection to it, and I ask for the present
consideration of the joint resolution.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think it had better go
over until to-morrow.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think it had better go
over. These transfers of appropriations are
only another name for taking money out of
the Treasury.
Mr. ANTHONY. Of course I do not wish
to call up the resolution now against the wish
of any Senator; but I will state that unless
this resolution or something like it passes the
public printing cannot go on. The Congres-
sional Printer is not able to pay the expenses
from his own pocket, nor is the Committee on
Printing. We are constantly ordering print-
ing, and it will be a very great detriment to the
public service unless the work can go on.
Mr. SHERMAN. Why not make a direct
appropriation ?
Mr. FOWLER. Is it in order to consider
the resolution now?
Mr. ANTHONY. I do not wish to press it
against the wish of any Senator.
