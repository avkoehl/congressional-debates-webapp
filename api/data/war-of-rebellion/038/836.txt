BOVINA, May 5, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I have ordered General Featherston to send a force to support Colonel Orr at Edwards Depot, and General Tilghman will be en route in the shortest possible time. If 2,000 infantry are advancing, they must have a large force, otherwise it is incredible.
