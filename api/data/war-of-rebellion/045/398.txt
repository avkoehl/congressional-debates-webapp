HEADQUARTERS TWELFTH CORPS, Woodsborough,

June 29, 1863-6. 20 p. m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Owing to the very serious delay I have met with to-day from trains which I think do not belong on this road, I shall not be able to get beyond Double Pipe Creek to-night with my command. When I left Frederick, there were a great number of men form every corps in the army lying about the streets, beastly drunk. I think it important that a cavalry force should be sent back to bring them up.

Yours, respectfully,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully, &c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
