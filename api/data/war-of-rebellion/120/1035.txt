COLONEL: I have the honor to report the condition of prison and prison hospital for the week ending to-day, as follows:

The buildings, interior and exterior, present a clean and tidy appearance. The streets and avenues, by constant policing, are free from all filth and smell. The kitchens of both departments are in good order. The clothing and bedding of the prisoners is clean and comfortable. No change of importance since last report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. CARAHER,

Lieutenant Colonel Fourth Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps,

Approved and respectfully forwarded to Colonel William Hoffman, U. S. Army, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

The One hundred and ninety-seventh Pennsylvania left on Friday. This leaves us short of garrison. We have 951 enlisted men for duty. Application has been made to General Hooker for six companies more. We are fully prepared for the arrival of any prisoners.

Colonel, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,October 25, 1864.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

Mr. Robinson, of the New York Tribune, has been in a Confederate prison about sixteen months. There have been many unsuccessful attempts by his friends to get him released. E. A. Pollard, of the Richmond Examiner, the New York World of the Confederacy, is a captive in our hands on his parole at Brooklyn. I am assured that if he can be permitted togo on his parole to Richmond we can obtain Mr. Richardson. If there is no reason why not, please and Pollard to me.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, October 25, 1864-12 m.

Major-General BUTLER:

All the invalid prisoners at Eastern stations have been assembled at Point Lookout. Please see my letter of October 9. About 2,000 invalid prisoners at Western stations are ready for transfer when the place is designated. Please see my telegram of October 13. If there are any remaining at Eastern stations I will have them collected at Point Lookout.

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.
