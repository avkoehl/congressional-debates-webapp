infantry, supported by Kirby Smith, was en route to Glasgow. I have no doubt there is some foundation for these reports, and the troops should be got ready at once to move.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Have instructed Granger to keep his force ready and keep in communication with you, and have also asked Governor Morton to send any troops he can spare on your requisition. Don't know that he has any, but don't make the call unless necessary to do so.

Yours, truly,

WRIGHT.

Brig. General J. T. BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Morton will send troops on your call, and Granger has been instructed to move most of his force toward Munfordville, via Lebanon. I do not believe the rebels will come into Kentucky with any large force, but it may be so. More likely it is a demonstration to draw attention from the raid on Grant's communication, but we must be prepared. Where is Gilbert? His force at Columbia is not strong enough to resist the force you report, and should fall back on Munfordville or Lebanon, if that report is correct, or, if strong enough after collecting what he can, he should attack and whip them. Rosecrans will telegraph to follow up any move in force the enemy may make. A merry Christmas.

WRIGHT.

NASHVILLE, December 24, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Cincinnati:

Boyle reported last evening, from Gallatin, over 7,000 of enemy within 4 miles of Bledsoe's Creek; expects to be attacked this morning. Has just reported that scout who left Rome yesterday reported Morgan
