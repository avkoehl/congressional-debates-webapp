APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August, ÍU1I
27th Cong — 1st Sess.
Repeal of Independent 7reasury—Mr. Pearce.
H. of Reps,
Sty colleague is reported to have said, l that at the late elec
¿fori, and during the contest, rut one word had been said about
the Sub Treasury, or the cardinal principle involved m it,
which was a separation of the Government from banks," and
that "the mam principle of the measure had, m no single m
stance, been assailed dunngthelast Presidential canvass ' To
this aseeition I must be allowed in all good humor, to oppose a
positive and peremptory contradiction Sir^my colleague ten
tured to make some pi ediction  about th" President ai election
which were not verified by the result I do not mean to charge
him with a want of sincerity, but 1 think I can show that, as he
was a false prophet, so a'eo is he a bad historian, and that I can
convince even him that he is as much mistaken after the fact
as he was before the fact The Sub Treasury was discussed
more, 1 thmk, than any othei single topic during the Presiden
«al contest—-at all events m Maiyland I wa  the theme oí
many orators at the National Con mention m Baltimore on the
4th ofMay, lb40 It furnished mottoes and devices for the nu
meroue dags and banners carried in the pioces&ion on that occa
eion, and in the numerous processions between that period and
the election Every one recollects the banner whose device re
presented Mr Van Buren as crushed to the earth by a ¡sub
Treasury screw while he exclaimed, "this is a pressure winch
do honest man ought to regret,J
In my own district, in Ju y, IS40, a convention was held m
Bastón, where several thousand oeople were addies ed by seve
ral gentlemen, some of whom are now on this floor—by the gen
tiernan from Geotgia (Mr King } by my colleague fiom Balti
more, [Mr Kennedy,] and by others, who divided the subjects
ofdiseussion among them Í recollect that a gentleman from
Kentucky, not now in the House [Mr Graves 1 spoke to the
people fiom 7 o'clock till 10 m the evening, and that he con
fined himself exclusively to the subject of the sub Treasury,
whieh he examined in every one of its known phas*1-. He dis-
cussed its principles, cardinal and aubordmate—its operations
upon credit, currency, and commerce Of course he Jid not
examine the scheme which my colleague now, I believe foi the
first time, suggests, of giving the appointment of the Sub
Treasurers, once in every four yeats, to the Presidential elec
tors He took it in the shape m which it had passed Congiess
and received the President's sanction which ¡sanction, 1 venture
to think, it never would have obtained if one of its cardinal
principles had been to divest Mr Van Buren of so much of hi--
patronage During the Presidential canvass thsSuo Treasury
question was discussed m the heart of my colleague's own dis
trict, in the city oí Frederick—among others, by the gentleman
/rom Indiana, (Mr Pko^fit,] who examined it m all its pnnci
pies and details, and dissected and developed every part and
parcel of it My colleague before me, [Mr Johnson,} who was
always in the field, laboring in the cau^e of the peo¡ le made,
perhaps, íorty speeches on the subject The^c are only a few
of the many instances which I cou'd name in reply to my col
league s challenge
I was a member of the Cungre¡>s m which Mr \an Buren
fir  piessed hi3 SubTreasmy plan "so was my colleague
from Baltimore [Mr Ke^nbdv. ] who, dimng that term de
Iivered in this House a very able speech against the measme
and who, even as late as May íaot, ) tot before his election,
in a publication addiessed to the people deciaiel his cm
turned hostility to it, and invoked their sufLages on that very
account Both of us had rerordedour votes agamst it more
than once, and I had repeatedly aigued it before the people of
my district
If it was not discussad m ray colleague's [Sir Mason's]
district during the late canvass for Congress, I apprehend
that it was his own fault, for, though he is very able to de
fend his opinions, I have been informed that it was not his po-
licy to meet his opponent in the discussions to which iie was
invited
[Here Mr MASONsaidhe hi! met Mr Lynch two o- th   e
times, and that the canvass was a.very shoit one ]
You will recollect, air, that it was not until several mon hs
after the r ommation oí Geneial Harrison that the bub Treasury
finally passed both Houses of Congress Thrice had it been
rejected by the Repreoentatnes of the people and it was no
until this House had been organized by t! e violatnn of t e
mostsacred rights ot a sovereign State and of the univer ally
recognised forms of legaíative oigan zation that it was im
posed upon the peopie by a email and spurious majority
During the very height of the Presidenti I canvass this mea
sure was underdiscussion m Congiess The debate was pro
tracted through thirty uavs of the session, and was distm
guished tor the ardor and ahüi y of the Opposition to the nif a
sure It received the signature of Mr Van Buren on the 4th
of July, 1840, and was therefore berated to the people as a
second Declaration of Independence AH this was den ng the
Piesidential canvass, in the com e of which b th General
Harrison and Mr Tyler announced theit determined opposi
tion to it How then can it be said that this was abandoned as a
testqustion, unless it be admitted that it was abandoned by the
party which passed it"* How can it besupposed that it did not
materially influence the result of the elections when every one
knows that the currency question has mainly divided parties in
this country for the last ten years-, and that the abuses of the
banking system and the empmcal expenments of the two last
Administrations have only riveted th * com nued interest of!he
people to the subject? To suppose otherwise would be to think
the people ignorant of then own welfare, and regardless of the
subjects most important to their mtetests I admit that the
friends of Mr Van Bui en made up othcrand mmori sues bur
this only snows their anxiety to strengthen themselves and
their unwi hngness to risk the result upon thegieat questions
of currency and fioance
Í am not surprise 1 that mv colleague should consi ler the
arguments employed agamst the SubTieasury m re dema
gegue's slang,' wh ch did not touch the "cardinal principle '
tif the measure Buthu 9 only matter of opinion I think
that the people ate not aiich ab i actionize as to con&id>n a

of onediv ice—the separation oí the Federal Government from
the bank of theirown cieation, and thecstabli hmentofan un
happy financial polygamy ins ead of this legi ¡mate alliance,
which only pioduced disaster to the currency and commerceof
the country When fíen fackson had destroyed his hated
monster, the Bank of the TTmted States, Mr Van Buren swoie
uncompromising hostility to it, and when (he pet bank system
dissolved m its own weakness m ÍS37, nothing was left for the
party then in power but to adopt an expedient which so late as
1335 they 1 ad utterly repudiated So the Sub Treasui v écheme
waa not original with Mr Vau Buren It wa<* first in tod uceó*
into the Hou<ss of Repiesenlatives in 1^35 by Mi G irrion of
Vngin a, who submitted it as an amendment to the tuiliegulai
mg the deposites ot the Uii ed Pta es in cei a' i lout haul *
Tin*amendment ¡ r >pos 1 that the c llecms ot the public íe
venue, where the amount  were small  hould be the agents of
the Treasti y o ktcr and di burse the same, that at places
whete the amount collected should te 1 irge, nxeners" should
be appo-nttd ' to be agents ef tt p Treasury" to keep and dis
buise the public moneys—that they should be paid an annual
compensation for their services, and that the pubic lcvenue
should b* paid m the curren  com of th  United States Heie,
sir, wis the first legislative attempt,  o fai as I am nformed,
tosepaialethe Government horn the bai k*, by refusing then
ageticy and discrediting tneirno es
What lavoi did th s "cardinal principle' meet with it the
hands of the Treasury lords and cxchequei chancellors of that
day? In his íeport on the orient system o keeping and dis
biasing the public mono male at the same session of Con
ere 8, Mi Woodbuiy anticipated this plan, and gave his views
upon it He conceded that it would be practicable, butdid n t
rec^mme id it, because, though a cardinal pr nciple" now, he
then thought that it would render our system "les* tesponsib'e,
safe, convenient, and economical "
In the II use it received Us deaJi blow from the leader of
the Van Buien party, Mr Polk, who,s how (quantummuta
tus ab Wo) the^ub Treasury candidate foi the office of Gover
noi oí I ennessee It i  true that he did not argue it veiy ela
borately, but seemed to treat it with contemptuous noncha
lance as the slight and flimsy project of an abstractionist, and
deserving, therefore no very serious notice Nevertheless in
hisspeeüi on the Deposite bill Mr Polknot only endowed Mr
Wooibury's doc tune, but gave additional reasons why tin 
cardinal principle should not be adopted He thought a coi
poiation ' sarer than an individual atfent howevei responsible
hemaj be, because jt consists of an association of in lividual«,
who have thrown together their aggieeated wealth, and who
aie bound m their corporate character to the extent of their
whole capital stock for the deposite " He said that "colla'e
ral security mi?ht be required ul the bank*, thus increasing the
safety of tht;dep s tp whilettmight well be questioned vvhetl er
t' e heaviest security an individual could givecould makethe
deposites safe at the point of large collection " "Tiiat eev ei al
milhons plight be m the hands of a receiverat one time, and
if he weie corrupt or engaged in trade or speculation and met
with a reverse of fortune, the los* sustained by Government
would be inevitable * Jle m&tanced the tea cases, m which
the Government lost a million or more a few years be/ore, and
concluded that the pet bank sy tern was tobe preferred to pub
licieceiveis, upon the groundof safetv tothepjbhc
This wat. h s fii t objection to the divorce principle His
second was that banks possessed "an inirea°ed facility over
indiv áual collectors or receivers m makin°" transfers of
public Jnon«y to disiat t points of isbdisement without ci ar,e
t > the pubi c ' and he pronounced this to be a service wh ot
i üividualb, to the extent,of our laige rev^rue  could not
perform "
The 'uiidmal principle ' was still more dntxtly a tacked by
his third objeción viz that it would ab&tract money from trade
and circulation, and injuriously affect the value of every aiticle
of merchandise and property Mr Polk said mat, as the
amount of revenue and eacpendituies fluctuated, ' the-e will be
atoóme times a considerable surplus n the Treasury which
though it maybe temporal y, if itbe withdrawn from circula
tion, and placed in the strong box of a receiver the amount of
Circulation will be injuriously disturbed by hoarding the de
posife, by which the value of eveiy article of merchandise and
property would be adected " That it would be very mconve
m^nt o abstract from trade and circulation the e\cess of rcve
nue not warned for immediate disbursement Whilst onde
posite m bank "die bank may use it, keepirg itself at the
titne ready to [ ay when demanded ard it is % t withdravn

My object, however, is not «o much to debate the Sub-Trea
sury pi in as t) examine the argument of my colleague He
announced in the outset that he would not present to the House
those ti ite ideas which have ceneral y been employed upon the
subject of a National Bank fie did not piopose to illuminate

abti-i) who shall undertake to iollow them
My colleague says there are lnfeiences to he drawn from
featuies of the Constitution which would positively prohibit the
establishment of a National Ban , and that the most lmpor-
tant of these features is? that which forb d  the cieation of any
monopoly m this country Now,  ir, I have lead the Constitu-
tion more than once, and if the woid monopolv occuis in it
from the alpha to the omega, or any clause piohlbi mg a mo
nopoly they aie not to be found in the common eduiors The
gentleman yays that no one can denv that a National Bank is a
monopoly Sir, at the peril of exposing myself to his philio
logical cutici^m I must vtntuie to make thi denial Political
deciaimers are generally loo e in their language, and to what
evei they desire to make odious they apply od'ous terms, with
refeience potto their accuracy and fitness, but only to their
effect
In the Intelligencer's report he [Mr Macon] is made to eay
that the bill which passed the House ye°teiday allowed seven
percent to be charged en discounts, while the Ie^al mteieetof
the country was only six percent thus confbtnng a special
pimiege on the Bank This is a mistake, perhaps it may be
the Reporter's error It is true that the dividends are limited
to «even per cent in order to prevent overtrading by the Bank
But how is this a special privilege conferred on the institution,
and making it a monopoly Without this provsion the Bank
might have divided twenty pei cent ií it could have made so
much, so that m truth the provision, instead of bestowing a
pi ívilege, is a restriction upon the Bank—an abndgement of
what would otherwise have been a common and undoubted
right, to make the moot oi tof then money My colleague says
that it is a monopoly because it confers upon a few exclusive
privileges and without any equivalent Here, again, is a mis
take of íác, foi the bill passed yesterday incorporates
a Bank as the fiscal agent of the Government, giving
it no unusual corpoiate powers, and requirng in return
for what it does give the performance of many useful «er
vices to the Government, in the safekeeping, transfer, and
di-hursement of the public revenue —for which services the
Government must otherwise employ salaried agente Exclu-
sive privileges do not of themselves constitute a monopoly,
m the stiict sense of the word A monopoly is definen ty all
good legal wnteis to be "a license or privilege allowed to any
person or persons for the sole buyin^, selling, roakng, work
mg, or uoing of any thing, by which otheis are restiamed of
any freedom or liberty that they had before, or hmde ed m
their lawful trade "* Now, a charter may be so drawn as to
grant a monopoly but what is there in the charter of any Na
tional Bank, hitherto known or now proposed, which hinders
anyone m his lawful tiade oi restiams any one of any free
dom oM berty that he 1 adbefon? Is it the powei of discount-
ing'' sir, any man who has money to discount another's note,
ol buy his b 11 of exchange may still do so without let or hin-
drance from the National Bank Is it the authority to receive
deposites? Any man is at liberty to build his vaults, and fill
them with the money of those who are willing to trust tfe
morsel of mammon to his keeping Is it the power to wsi*
notes? Why, sir, there is not, in the bill to incorporate the
subscribers to the Fiscal Bank, any thing restrictive of this
right, and every merchant in the country may still issue his
shinplasters to all who choo=e to take them Is it in the sttpu*
lauon to receive the notes of the bank in payment of the public
revenue? This only en arges the liberty of every debtoi of the
Government—it i  a contract the bent-fit of w* ich m^res, not
to the bai k on'y but to every tax p-iyer in the cr un ry who
i re ea ed bv it f ora the i eceas¡ y u ¡.avii _, the Gover i ent
in gold and sdvei
Is it a mm optly because it is provide 1 that the publi<* rroj
ncys shall be deported m the Bark ana i  branche , o ¡e
«ately Kept, transferí ed, afddaoui ed without thdree to the
Government? This is nothing mn^ than the exern e by tía
Government off n ird visual light commen to every one
I ans u i íy colleague s questi m then * If a Bank !  not. i
monopilv what i*. ífí" by saying that k isa enrpo at ion which

where priva tt >ankmg i  iegulat"d or re^tiam^d by s ati/e, a

tKeprivate n«ht is les-amed for wise munKi al purposes,
and by genial íeeisla ion and a charter grartcd though it
may conf r an exclusive rrmipge, ian.es avay no light or
freedom whic i any one had before
My co league seems to have misapprel e^dedthe princ pie of
the amendment introduced into the Sena e bill The power of
Congress to e«tab ish a Bank as a national instituí i o, and to
place branches m the different States, is not yielded by that
amendment as I understand it It is a compr muse, the effect
of wh ch ¡s to deny to the Bank as such, the right to extend its
branchps into the Sta es which declare tbeir dissent, but the
powei of Gongre°s is expíen / asserted, I think jn the provi&o,
and w thout doubt it voul 3 be exei ed upon a proper occa-
sion
Neither i  it to be supposed because the citv of Wa«<hmg'on
13 to be the s^at of the Bank that i is only as the local Legisla
ture of the Di&tnc of t olumbia hat we claim ti e right to in
empmate it Those who think it expedient to establish a
National Bank entertan no such pueuliues They believe
that Gcnsiess legislates for the Via net not by the authority
denv ed fiom Maryland an 1 "V irsi na as y colleague says, but
in virtue of that clause of the Constitution which gives them
the r ght "to exercise exclusive legislation over such District,
natex ceding ten raikc^u ie as may by cession of particular
S/ates and the acreptaur f t igrps*1 become the ^eat of Go-
vernment ot the I rated State  But my colleague maintains
that the Legislature of Vai viand h„s no power to incorporate
b i ika, because the Constitution of he í?t ite doe¡s not in express
teims gran* such power Now, I assert that the I egi lature of
the State is absolute and uncontrolled except by the restric-
tions and limitations presented by the bill of rights and form
of Government and by the Constitution of the Ihu ed States
Though the Federal Government and that of Maryland rest
upon the same basis, the will and the poner of the people,
yet they differ in this—that  the former is a Gov ei nmentof
