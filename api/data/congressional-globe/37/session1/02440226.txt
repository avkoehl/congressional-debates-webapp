Commerce, reported back, without amendment,
a bill (H. 11. No. 55) supplementary to an act to
protect the commerce of the United States and
punish the crime of piracy.
The bill was read.
Mr. SHEFFIELD. This bill simply applies
the principle now applicable to the slave trade to
piracy, as recognized by the law of nations.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. One question in
that connection. If I heard the bill aright,it con-
fines the punishment to the crime* of piracy as'
that ciime is defined by the law of nations. Am
1 coirect?
Mr, SHEFFIELD. It simply provides for
proceedings in rem, and docs not at all ailectany
pu nishmont.
Mr. VALLANDTGHAM. Does it alter the
definition of the crime of piracy?
Mr. SHEFFIELD. Not at all.
Mr. VALLAN LMLUI AM. There is only one
objection, th'un, and that is,that itis rather hasty
legislation.
Mr. SHEFFIELD. I demand the previous
question.
The piovioux question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put.
1 lie bill was then ordered to be engrossed, and

the President, of the United States relative to the
appointment of a joint commission for the pro-
tection of the fisheries adjacent to the northeast-
ern coast and tiio islands of North America, have
had the same under consideration, and have in-
structed me to report it bock, with a recommend-
ation that this whole subject be postponed until
the first Monday of the next session of Congress.
The motion was agreed to.
WORLD'S FAIR.
Mr. SUMNER. The same committee, to whom
was referred a message from the President of the
United States, communicating the correspondence
with the British minister relative to an exhibition
of the products of industry of all nations, which
is to take place at London during the year 1862,
and to whom, also, was referred a joint resolution
(S. No. 8) in relation to the world's fair, to be held
in London, in the spring of 1862, introduced by
the Senator from Ohio, [Mr. Wade,] have had the
same under consideration, and have instructed me
to reporta jointresolution, of which I ask for the
consideration now.
The joint resolution (S. No. 9) relative to the
exhibition of the industry of all nations, to be
holden in London in the year 1862, was read the
first time by its title.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous conscnt to consider it now.
Mr. BROWNING, Mr. TRUMBULL, and
others. Let it be read.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
Be it resolved, $c , That thePiesident be, and he hereby
is, authorized to take such moasuies as shall to lum seem
best to facilitate apioper representation of the industrial
interests of the United States at the exhibition of industry
of nil nations, to ho holden at London, in the year 18t32;
and the sum of $2,01)0 is hereby appropriated tor the inci-
dental expenses thereof.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think perhaps the reso-
lution had better lie over. I somewhat question
the propriety of Government embarking in an en-
terprise of this kind. I do not know that I shall
oppose it; but let it go on the Calendar.
Mr. SUMNER. If the Senator requests it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Yes, sir; I prefer that it
should go over.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will go on
the Calendar.
DISTRICT AND CIRCUIT COURTS.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom Was referred a bill (S. No.
39) to provide for holding the district and circuit
courts in judicial districts, during a  temporary
vacancy in the judgeship, have instructed me to
report it back, with a recommendation that it pass.
Mr. POLK. I think that had better he over.
It has not been printed, I behove. I have not
seen it. *
Mr. TRUMBULL. It has not been printed.
I have no objection to its going on the Calendar.
I will state to the Senator from Missouri that
there is only one provision in it, which is simply
to authorize, in States where there are two judicial
districts, the judge in one district to hold the court
in tfie other, in case of a temporary vacancy.
Mr. POLK. I will say to the Senator that 1
think there is likely to be no objection to the bill,
but I wish lo examine it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have no objection to its
lying over.
The bill was placed on the Calendar.
GOVERNMljNX CONTRACTS.
Mr. COWAN. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary, to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 22)
for I he piotection of CJovennmnt contracts, have
directed mo to report, as a substitute for that, a
bill (S. No. 43) to prevent and punish fraud on
the part of ollieers intrusted Willi the making of
contracts for the Government. 1 ask that it be
read twice, and printed.
Mr. "WADE. It is only an amendment of the
former bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
understands that it is reported buck as an original
bill from the committee.
Mr. COWAN. Yes, sir.
The PRESIDENT tempore. It will be so
treated.
The bill was read twice by its title, and ordered

AJ15IS TO LOYAL CITIZENS.
Mr. "WILSON. I am directed by the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs and the Militia to report
back, with a recommendation that it pass, the bill
(S. No. 38) making an appropriation to pay the
expenses of transporting and delivering arms and
munitions of war to the loyal citizens of the States
now in rebellion against the Government of the
United States, and io provide for the expense of
organizing them into companies, battalions, regi-
ments, or otherwise, for their own protection
against domestic violence, insurrection, invasion,
or rebellion. I ask that the bill be now considered.
The PR ESI DENT pro tempore. It requires the
unanimous consent of the Senate. If no objection
be made, the bill will be considered at the present
time. The Chair hears no objection; and the bill
is before the Senate as in Committee of the Whole.
The bill proposes to appropriate dollars
for the objects indicated in its title,
Mr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee, I move to Ml
the blank with $2,000,0(^0 as a beginning.
Mr. WILSON. The committee did not fill the
blank, wishing to leave that matter to the Senate.
The Senator from Tennessee moves to fill the
blank with ยง2,000,000; and I am assuied by the-
members of the committee, that, so far as they are
concerned, that will be entirely satisfactory to
them.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment was concurred in. The bill
was ordered to be engrossed, and read a third time.
It was read the third time, and passed.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee, subsequently
asked unanimous conscnt to allow the bill to be
amended; but objection was made.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Tennessee, I move tore-
consider the vote by which the bill was passed.
The motion was agreed to; and the vote order-
ing the engrossment and third reading of the bill
was also reconsidered.
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee. I move to
amend the bill by inserting the words " or m which
rebellion is or may be threatened;" so as to make
it lead:
The loyal citizens residing many of the States which are
in rebellion against the Government of the United States,
or m which rebellion is or may be threatened.
The amendment was agreed to,
Mr. COLLAMER. I was not m the Senate
when the bill passed this morning, I do not like
the phraseology of the bill. It seems to me that
a State cannot be in rebellion against the United
States. The inhabitants of the State may bo, but .
not the State. I move to amend so as to make is
read:
The States of which the inhabitants now arc or hereafter
may be in rebellion, &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed fora third
reading,nnd was read the third time^and passed.
Its title was amendedso as to read: "A bill mak-
ing an appropriation to pay the expenses of trans-
posing and delivering arms and munitions of war
to the loyal citizens of the States, the inhabitants
of which now are or hereafter majr be in rebellion
against the Government of the United States^and
to provide for the expense of organizing them into
companies, battalions, regiments, or otherwise,
for their own protection against domestic violence,
insurieetion, invasion, or rebellion."
Mr. THOMSON. I was not in my scat when
the bill was passed at first. I desire, by unani-
mous consent, to have my vote recorded in the
aificmafivo.
The PRESIDENT jiro tempore. There was no
division on the passage of the bill.
ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEERS.
Mr. WILSON. I move to take up the bill
which [ introduced yesterday, being the bill (S,
No. 42) in addition to the " Act to authorize the
employment of volunteers to aid in enforcing the
laws and protecting public property,"approved
July 22, 1861.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That bill is
first m order on the Calendar, and is now before
the Senate as in Committee of the Whole for con-
sideration; and it wdl be read at length.
The bill was read. It authorizes the President
to accept the services of volunteers, either as cav-
alry, infantry, or artillery, in such numbers as the
exigencies of the public service may, in his opin-
ion, demand, to be organized asauthorized by the
act of the 22d July, 1861. These volunteers are
to be armed as the President may direct, to be
subject to the rules and articles of war, and to be
upon the footing in all respects with similar corps
of the United States Army, and to be mustered
into the service for "during the war."
Mr. WILSON. I move to amend the first sec-
tion by adding these words:
Pi ovideS, That the number of troop5? hereby authorized
shall not exceed five hundted thousand.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON. I now move to add an addi-
tional section to the bill:
Jlnd be it further enacted, That the President shall bo
