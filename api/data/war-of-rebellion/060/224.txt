HDQRS. LEE'S DIV., CAV. CORPS, ARMY OF N. VA.,March 31, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose to you Colonel Dahlgren's note-book,* just sent to me by Colonel Beale, commanding Ninth Virginia Cavalry. Had I known of its existence it would have been forwarded with the papers.

His name and rank is written on the first page, with the date (probably) of his purchasing it. The book, amongst other memoranda, contains a rough pencil sketch of his address to his troops, differing somewhat from his pen-and-ink copy. I embrace this occasion to add, the original papers bore no marks of alteration, nor could they have possibly been changed except by the courier who brought them to me, which is in the highest degree improbable, and the publication of them in the Richmond papers were exact copies in every respect of the originals.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,April 3, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the papers pertaining to Dahlgren's expedition against Richmond, forwarded yesterday. Lieutenant Davis, of General Winder's staff, delivered them in person.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,April 10, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General:

GENERAL: On the receipt of your letter inclosing the documents found on the body of Colonel Dahlgren, in accordance with the instructions of the Department, I wrote a letter to General Meade upon the subject, under the date of April 1, and sent it to General Stuart, to be forwarded by flag of truce. In consequence, however, of the late heavy rains it has been impossible to cross the Robertson River at the point where flags of truce have usually been received by the Federal commanders, and I fear the same cause will prevent any communication for some time.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
