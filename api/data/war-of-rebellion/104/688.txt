ATLANTA, May 9, 1865.

Major-General WILSON:

If you send negroes to work on the railroad you had better send 700 spades and shovels and as many axes sent with [them]. There are many ties to be got out. I think 3,000 men can put this railroad in running order in two weeks. Shall send out parties northwest to-day. Will write you and send to-morrow morning a short statement of the condition of the railroad to Dalton.

Your obedient servant,

E. F. WINSLOW,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

Major General J. B. STEEDMAN,

Commanding District of the Etowah, Kingston, Ga.:

GENERAL: This will be handed you by John W. Glenn, whom I have sent up to take charge of the railroad repairs northward from Atlanta. He will explain his views and the means at his disposal, as well as what assistance he will need from you. Funds and tools will be the most essential means necessary at this end. It would be well to arrange for disbursement through your own quartermaster, as I have no money
