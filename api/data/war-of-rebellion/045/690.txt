S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JULY 14, 1863-1 p. m.

Brig. General G. K. WARREN:

SANDY HOOK, July 14, 1863-1. 20 p. m.

GENERAL WARREN,

Chief Engineer, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

If the canal is serviceable from here to Shepherdstown, I could be there by daylight to-morrow, and probably have the bridge completed by 11 a. m. How wide is the river there? In order to get material for more than 620 feet of bridge, I must dismantle the land train your ordered made up. After receiving your order to build the bridge here, I could not spare men to work on the canal. The canal superintendent has gone down to do the work, but I don't think he has fairly commenced the work yet. It will take him two days to repair the break, with plenty of wheelbarrows, which he has not on hand.

I. SPAULDING,

Lieutenant-Colonel of Volunteer Engineers.
