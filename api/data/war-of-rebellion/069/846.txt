They have appeared between Taliaferro's and Price's, beyond Hanover Court-House, and have also appeared at Wickham's. Infantry is reported as also cavalry. Be prepared to move in any direction.

Major-General ANDERSON,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Rodes directs me to inform you that the enemy is reported advancing infantry skirmishers up the south side of Totopotomoy Creek, and he has thrown out skirmishers to meet them. As matters now stand, in event of any engagement this corps will be required, it is supposed, to watch the right and rear, and one division will be on the left of Early's, which is on the road to Pole Green Church, and the other on the right of it. Major-General Rodes requests that you will keep a few vedettes to watch between him and General Breckinridge, and if you move please notify him.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,
