my pickets there connect with the cavalry. From an examination of a few prisoners I find they belong to the Seventh Confederate Cavalry, to Heth's division, and to Hoke's brigade, of Beauregard. Prisoners are not very willing to communicate, but they say there are troops of Beauregard's in reserve in Petersburg all the time. I have directed the prisoners to be sent up to you.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 18, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: By laying the inclosed sketch* on your two inch map you can see exactly our present position. My artillery is so disposed that it of itself will be able to hold considerable portions of my line. You must excuse my hasty and disjointed dispatches to-day, for I had to write with all the interruptions of severe battle and movements.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

As soon as Mott's division, of Hancock's corps, can be got over from Deep Bottom he will relieve some 5,000 or 6,000 of Parke's troops that will be sent at once to your support. Mott is moving now. Parke will also send you in the course of the night or toward morning some 1,500 men. They will move as soon as they can be relieved by some of Ord's troops.
