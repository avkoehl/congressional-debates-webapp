AUGUST 30, 1861.

Brigadier-General COX,

Gauley:

The general thinks that Major Casement with his command had better go up the Elk to about the mouth of the Big Sanday and look out for and stop straggling parties coming from the enemy's column, and also intercept some guerrillas about to be driven from Spencer Court-House. It is believed they will take that direction to the main column.

Brigadier-General COX,

Your two dispatches of yesterday received to-day. Please number yours; acknowledge receipt of mine by numbers. Watch south side by scouts and spies. Reconnoiter Floyd closely in some force, if necessary. We will try to be down to Sutton by Sunday. Loomis, assistant quartermaster, has been ordered to relieve Treat. Presume he will be up to-morrow.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg:

A spy brought me information from south side of river last evening. He says 500 rebel troops are encamped twelve miles up Loop Creek, connecting with 2,000more near Fayette; that they have no artillery, and a large portion of them are inrregular; that Wise is not there and it is not his command, but Colonel Beckley's, of Raleigh County. Colonel Guthrie sends word from Charleston that 500 of the enemy are at peytona, also under Colonel Beckley. These last he had arranged for Lieutenant-Colonel Enyart, First Kentucky, to attack. I write this morning to Enyart to make himself sure of both position and force before crossing the river. Enyart is at Witcher's Creek. Major Hines, of the Twelfth, with two companies, went forward yesterday to reconnoiter Floyd, who has nothing but a few mounted scouts this side of Peters Creek. He has not reported yet. Colonel Frizell, of the eleventh, will also reconnoiter toward Wise to-day. Your Numbers 1, of 30th of August, received this morning.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Major Hines reports that on sifting information he is satisfied the force with Floyd cannot be over 2,500, of which, say, 200 is cavalry; that a little more than half of this si at Cross-Lanes and the rest in detachments at Summersville, Carnifix Ferry, Peters Creek, and on a path leading toward Elk. He could learn nothing new of the artillery.
