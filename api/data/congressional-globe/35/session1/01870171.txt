Senate.
stead of having to feed cattle on a thousand hills, you have
to chase the stump-tailed steer through the sedge-patches
to procure a tough beef-steak."
Mr. G. S. Sullivan, of Lincoln county, North
Carolina, says, in the Patent Office report for 1851:
"We raise no stock of any kind, except for home con-
sumption, and not half enough for that; for we have now
worn out our lands so much that we do not grow food
enough to maintain them."
Mr. N. B. Powell, of Alabama, in the Patent
Office report for the same year, says:
" We are the most dependent people in the Union, rely-
ing mainly, as we do, upon our neighbors of tlie West for
nearly all of our supplies."
The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Clay] has de-
scribed, in sad accents, the desolation of portions
of his own native State. In traversing his own
native county of Madison, the Senator says:
" One will discover numerous farm-houses, once the
abodes of industrious and intelligent freemen, now occu-
pied by slaves, or tenantless, deserted, and dilapidated; he
will observe fields once fertile, now unfenced, abandoned,
and covered with those evil harbingers, fox-tail and brooin-
sedge; he will see the moss growing on the moldermg walls
of once thrifty villages; and will find ' one only master
grasps the whole domain' that once furnished happy homes
for a dozen white families. Indeed, a county in its infancy,
wliere, fifty years ago, scarce a forest tree had been felled
by the ax of the pioneer, is already exhibiting the painful
signs of senility and decay apparent m Virginia and the Car-
olinas: the freshness of its agricultural glory is gone; the
vigor of its youth is extinct, and tile spirit of desolation
seems brooding over it."
The Senator from Alabama is devoted to his
native State, of whose condition he thus sorrow-
fully speaks. Yesterday, he went even to the
verge of disunion, in favor of the expansion of
slavery to " virgin lands," which it will "despoil"
and impoverish, as it has despoiled and impover-
ished the State he represents.
" ' The lands of South Carolina,1 (we are told by' A Caro-
linian' in De Bow's Review,) 4 have remained stationaiym
price for the last thirty years, and in many instances they
have actually declined.' ' Our old fields,' (says the South
Carolina Agricultural Society in 1855,) ' are enlarging; our
homesteads are decreasing fearfully.' "
Judge Longstreet, a native of Georgia, refers to
a classic dwelling which occupied a lovely spot in
one of the most fertile regions of his native State.
It was overshadowed by majestic hickories, tow-
ering poplars, and strong-armed oaks. Forty-two
years afterwards, he visited this spot once so
lovely:
" The sun poured his whole strength upon the bold hill
which once supported the sequestered school-house: a dy-
ing willow rose from the soil which had nourished the ven-
erable beech ; flocks wandered among dwarf pines, and
cropped a scanty meal from the vale where the rich eane
had bowed and rustled to every breeze; and all around was
barren, dreary, and cheerless."
De Bow's "Resources of the South," from
Fenno's Southern Medical Reports, speaks of
"decaying old tenements;" in Georgia, "red old
hills, stripped of their native growth and viigin
soil, and washed into deep gullies, with here and
there patches of Bermuda grass and stunted pine
shrubs struggling for subsistence on what was
once the richest soil of America." Millions of
acres of the richest soil of the western world have
been converted into barrenness and desolation
by the untutored, unpaid, and thriftless labor of
slaves. This exhaustion of southern soil, tilled
by bondmen—this deterioration, decay, and des-
olation, now visible in what was once-the fairest
portion of the continent—stands confessed by the
most eminent writers of the South. These de-
scriptions of the decay and desolation of some of
the fairest portions of the sunny South, remind us
of the desolating effects of slavery upon the rich
fields of classic Italy, in the days of Tiberius
Gracchus, as described by the brilliant and philo-
sophic pen of our Bancroft, in his masterly article
on Roman slavery.
Turning, Mr. President, from this contempla-
tion of the desolations of slavery to the rugged
soil and still more rugged clime of the free North,
we shall see that the farms tilled by free, educated
men, are annually blooming with a fresher and
richer verdure; that they annually wave with
larger harvests of the varied products which find
markets in the cities and the villages, which com-
merce, manufactures,and the mechanic arts, cre-
ate, beautify, and adorn. While the plantations
of the South echo the sound of the lash by which
unpaid toil is impelled on in the blighting process
of exhausting the richest soils, the farms of the
free States are increasing in value, fertility, and
beauty; they are nursing a race of noble and in-
dependent men, where
—" the lowliest ftrm-house hearth is graced
With manlv hearts, in piety sincere;
Faithful in Tove; in honor stem and cliaste;
III friendship warm and true; in danger brave;
Beloved in life, and sainted in the grave."
There were, Mr. President, in 1850, in the free
States, 877,000 farms, containing 108,000,000
acres, valued at $2,143,000,000; being about $20
per acre. The products of these farms amounted
to more than $860,000,000. There were, in the
slave States,564,000 farms, containing 180,000,000
acres, valued at $1,117,000,000, being about $6
per acre; and the products of these plantations
amounted to about $G30,000,000. The farms of
the free States averaged 120 acres; the slave-Slate
plantations averaged more than 300 acres. The
34,000 farms of cold, sterile Massachusetts, aver-
aging 99 acres each, embrace 3,500,000 acres, val-
ued at $32 50 per acre,amounting to $112,000,000;
the 30,000 plantations ofSou th Carolina, averaging
540 acres each, embrace 16,000,000 of acres, val-
ued at $5 08 per acre, amounting to $82,000,000.
The farms of the free States are cultivated by
2,500,000 persons, and yield a production of
nearly $8 per acre, and more than $300 per head
to each person; the plantations of the slave States
are tilled by more than 3,250,000 persons, and
they yield a production of less than $4 per acre,
and less than $200 per head to each person.
Turning, Mr. President, from the agriculture
of the two sections, let us glance at the manufac-
tures. Here the superiority of the North stands
confessed. In 1850, the North had 94,000 es-
tablishments; $430,000,000 of capital invested;
$465,000,000 of raw material were used; 780,000
persons were employed; $196,000,000 were paid
for labor; and §842,000,000 were produced. The
South had only 27,OOOestablishments; $95,000,000
of capital; used $86,000,000 of raw material; em-
ployed 161,000 persons; paid $33,000,000 for labor;
and produced $165,000,000. Massachusetts had
8,300 establishments; $83,000,000 of capital; used
$86,000,000 of raw material; employed 165,000
persons; paid $40,000,000 for labor; and produced
$151,000,000. South Carolina had only l,400es-
tablishments; $7,000,000 capital; used $4,900,000
of raw material; employed 12,000 persons; paid
$2,300,000 for labor; and produced $9,700,000.
The wages of women are higher in the cotton-
mills of Massachusetts than the wages of men in
the iron works of South Carolina. The product-
ive industry of Massachusetts, in manufactures
and the mechanic arts, have increased immensely
since 1850. It now averages $280 per head; the
productive industry of South Carolina, according
to De Bow, is $62 per head.
De Bow estimates, Mr. President, that one half
of the agricultural products, and all of the man-
ufactures, are subjects of commerce. If this be
so, the value of the products which enter into the
commerce of the North is about fourteen hundred
million of dollars; value of products of the South,
$480,000,000. The value of the domestic com-
merce of the country is estimated to be six times
larger than the value of the foreign commerce.
The imports and exports of the North amounted
in 1855 to $400,000,000; the exports and imports
of the South to $132,000,000. The imports and
| exports of the city of New York amounted to
$278,000,000—more than twice the value of the
imports and exports of the South. Massachusetts
exported and imported in 1855, $73,000,000; South
Carolina, $14,000,000. The North had in 1850
188,000persons engaged in commerce; the South,
70,000.
Glancing at the means of transportation, we find
that the North had, in 1855, 4,250,000 tons of ship-
ping, valued at $212,000,000; the South, 855,000
tons of shipping, valued at $42,000,000. The
North built 528,000 tons in 1855; the South built
52,000. Massachusetts had, in that year, 970,000
tons of shipping, valued at $48,000,000; South Car-
olina had 60,000 tons, valued at $3,000,000. Mas-
sachusetts built 80,000 tons, valued at $4,000,000;
South Carolina built 60 tons, valued at $3,000. The
North has 18,000 miles of railroads, costing
$560,000,000; the South 7,000, costing $125,000,-:
000. Poor Massachusetts, that produces no rice,
makes up no part of'kirig" cotton, has $55,000,000 i
invested in railroads within her own borders, to
say nothing of the many millions she Eas invested
in other States. She has $60,000,000 of bank cap-
ital, and her poor "white slaves,"hey "mud-
sills," have $35,000,000 deposited in her savings
banks. Rich South Carolina, with her rice and
her cotton, has invested $12,000,000 in'railroads;
she has $17,000,000 of bank capital; but,Unhap-
pily, we have no statements of how many mtl-
lions her " well-compensated," "unaspiring"la-
borers have on deposit. Perhaps the Senator froto
South Carolina can furnish us with those statis-
tics.
From this contrast of the productive industry
and material resources of the two sections, which
the Senator from South Carolina put "face to
face," I pass to a brief consideration of their in-e
stitutions and means ofintellectualculture. In the
slave States, laws forbid the education of nearly
four millions of her people; in. the free States,
laws encourage the education of the people, and
public opinion upholds and enforces those laws.
In 1850, there wore 62,000 schools, 72,000 teach-
ers, 2,800,000 scholars in the public schools of the
free Slates; in the slave States, there'were 18,000
schools, 19,000 teachers, and 580,000 scholars.
Massachusettshasnearly 300,000 scholars in her
public schools, at a cost of $1,300,000; South Caro-
lina has 17,000 scholars in her public schools;
$75,000 is paid by the State, and the Governor in
1853, said that " under the present mode of ap-
plying it, it was the profusion of the prodigal
rather than the judicious generosity which con-
fers real benefits." New York has more schol-
ars in her public schools than all the slave States
together. Ohio has 502,000 scholars in her public
schools, supported at an expense of $2,250,000.
Kentucky has 76,000 scholars, supported at an
expense of $146,000.
The free States had, in 1850, more than 15,000
libraries, containing 4,000,000 volumes; the slave
States had 700 libraries, containing 650,000 vol-
umes. Massachusetts, the land of " hireling op-
eratives," has 1,800 libraries, which contain not
less than 750,000 volumes—more libraries and
volumes than all the slave States combined. The
little State of Rhode Island, a mere patch of 1,300
square miles on the surface of New England, has
more volumes in her libraries than have the five
great States of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, and Louisiana. De Bow, good southern
authority, says, that in every country the press
must be regarded as a great educational agency.
The free States had, in 1850, 1,800 newspapers,
with a circulation of 335,000,000; the slave States
had, at that time, 700 newspapers, with a circula-
tion of 81,000,000. The free States have seven
times as many religious papers, and twelve times
as many scientific papers as the South. Massa-
chusetts has more religious papers than all the
slaveholding States of the Union. She has a cir-
culation of 2,000,000 for her scientific papers; the
South has but372,000. The " hireling operatives,
mechanics, and laborers;" the very " mud-sills"
of society, read five times as many copies of sci-
entific papers as the entire South, including that
class which the Senator tells us leads " progress,
civilization, and refinement." Nine tenths of the
book publishers of the United States are in the
free States. The Charleston Standard, good au-
thority with the Senator, tells us " that their pic-
tures are painted at the North, their books pub-
lished at the North, their periodicals printed at the
North; that should a man rise with the genius of
Shakspeare, or Dickens, or Fielding, or of all
three combined, and speak from the South, he
would not receive enough to pay the cost of pub-
lication." That class, that favored class, which
leads, as the Senator tells us, " progress, civili-
zation, and refinement," force the literary talent
to the North, the home of " hireling operatives,"
to find not only publishers, but readers also.
Of the authors mentioned in Duyckinck's "Cy-
clopedia of American Literature," eighty.-seven
were natives of slave States, and four hundred
and three were natives of the free North—the land
of the " hireling laborers." Of the poets men-
tioned in Griswold's •' Poets and Poetry of Amer-
ica," seventeen were natives of the land where
they have that other class which leads " progress,
civilization, and refinement;" and one hundred
and twentv-three were natives of the land of hire-
