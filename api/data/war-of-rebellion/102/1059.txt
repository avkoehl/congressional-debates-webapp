WASHINGTON, D. C., July 7, 1865.

The inclosed dispatches just received from General Dodge and Connor in relation to the condition of Indian affair on the plains are respectfully transmitted for the information of the General-in-Chief of the Army.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,July 6, 1865-11. 45 a. m.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR, Fort Laramie:

Your dispatch received. You must do the best You can about rations. I don't think Government will interfere to make peace; they appear to [be] disposed to leave it with us. I have sent Your dispatch relating to it to General Grant. When Stag's brigade arrives will You be able to relieve the Eleventh Kansas and send them in to be mustered out? What time will You leave Fort Laramie? The wagon-road expedition up Nebraska is well on its way, and You will probably run across them.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE PLAINS,Fort Laramie, Dak. Ter., July 6, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I can relieve Eleventh Kansas when Stagg's brigade arrives. Colonel Moonlight is on way to Kearny, suspended from command. I have ordered him mustered out. His administration here was series of blunders. Colonel Cole passed Columbus yesterday; is getting along finely. He will probably meet surveyors. Colonel Kidd's regiment (Sixth Michigan) arrived at Kearny yesterday. Have ordered him here. Stagg is two days east of Kearny. Cannot possibly move without rations. Have sent an officer to hurry them up. Have also ordered rations from Kearny and Cottonwood and all subsistence trains bound for Denver and Julesburg to this post. I may be able to get away in ten days. The mail stages west of Denver have again been stopped by Indians. I leave for Camp Collins in the morning to see about it. I have six companies of cavalry at Collins and Halleck, and Utah troops are guarding line on Bitter Creek. Will start the stages again immediately.

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,July 6, 1865-3 p. m.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR, Fort Laramie:

General Mitchell says he has to guard trains from Marysville and Big Blue to Fort Kearny without any relief. Desires to have a post established by You midway between Rock Creek and Fort Kearny to relieve his escorts. Can You do it?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
