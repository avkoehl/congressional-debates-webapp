THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 20,
and a sound Democrat to require any indorsement
from me.
Affain, I read from the letter of the Hon. John
A. McClernand, to the people of Illinois. He says:
4<TbeTopekaand Lecompton constitutions alike deserve
the condemnation of all just men—the first as a rebellion
against the authority and Jaws of the United States; the
latter as a fraud and usurpation upon the rights of the peo-
ple of Kansas. One was an act of moral treason against the
Government; thu other is an act of moral treason against the
people. Nor does the submission of the slavery clause to
the vote of the people of Kansas extenuate the enormity of
the Lecompton outrage ; on the contraiy, it aggravates it—
aggiavatesit by adding insult to injury. Why not submit
the whole constitution ? It is answeied, because it would
have been voted down i If so, is not this the very reason
why jt should have been submitted, and should not be forced
upon the people of Kansas?"
The South never had a firmer or truer friend.
Many of the members of this House will recollect
liis coarse when a member, and his uniform sup-
port of the constitutional rights of the South.
Mr. Chairman, the Lecompton constitution, not
having received the ratification of the people, and
not fulfilling the requirements of the Kansas act,
and disregarding the Democratic principle of pop-
ular sovereignty, should be treated by the Presi-
dent and Congress as a nullity until it receives
such ratification. It is passing strange that certain
public journals and individuals, who were loud and
bitter against the Lecompton constitution before
the commencement of this session of Congress,
are now its warm and zealous advocates. I would
call upon an enlightened and honest community
to judge in regard to the means and influences
which have produced this sudden and marvelous
change in their opinions and actions. The Le-
compton constitution is the same now as when it
was framed by the convention; and, sir, I can see
no reason for such sudden conversions of gentle-
men, unless it be to enable them to bask m the
smiles of the Administration, and participate in
the favors it has to bestow.
Let me call the attention of the committee to
ccrtain articles from the New York Herald before
the commencement of this session of Congress:

Little did I think, Mr. Chairman, duiin^ the
late presidential campaign, when contending
against the Republican party, led by Colonel Fre-
mont, and backed by the New York Herald, that
this same Herald would read me out of the Dem-
ocratic party the first year of Mr. Buchanan's
administration; and that many politicians who
have been as vacillating in their politics as the
Herald, would join in the hue and cry of reading
Democrats out of the party, who never gave a
vote for President to any one but the regular nom-
inee of the party. The Herald, when writing
the above, was the warm friend of the Adminis-
tration, and it is fair to presume that he expressed
its views at that time.
The Union, I believe, has been the organ of
the Administration since it came into power. I
quote from an article of that paper, of the 7th
July, to show the opinions of the Administration
at that time on Kansas affairs:
" We repeat, that the constitution of Kansas must come
fiom the people of Kansas. Other povvei to make such an
instrument theie i* not under heaven.
" We do most devoutly believe that unless the constitu-
tion of Kansas be submitted to the direct vote ot the people,
the unhappy controversy which has hoietofore raged in that
Temtoiy will be piolon^ed for an indefinite time to come.
We are equally well convinced that the will of the major-
ity, whether it, he foi oi a^anis>t shiveiy, will lin illy ti luntpli,
though it may he after veam of stiife,'di--a-iioiw to the b"-t
interest-* of the countiy, and dangerous, it may he, to the
peace and safety of the whoie Union.
•'A^ain • thi-i movement of the tcmtorial authorities to
form a constitution is made, not m the ro«ulai way, in pur-
suance oi an enabling and author!zinc; act ot Confess, but
m the meie motion ol the Tentorial Le^ti-latuie itself.
Nay, it has been heyim and earned on in the teeth ot a ic-
fusal by Congress to pass such an act. Thi.s inedibility is
not fatal. There are other ca^es in which it wa? ovei looked.
Hut it can be waivrd only m c otiMdeiation ot' the (act that
the people h.ive expiessed their will in unmistakable lan-
guage. 1 f we dispense with the legal fornix of pioeeeduigs

T am not unaware of the mear.s and in^.tsures
resorted to to alfi-et public opinion. Already
prominent Democrats ore beini^ removed from
ollice, and, as 1 believe, for no other reason than
that they aie against the admission of Kansas
under a constitution to which three fourths of the
people are opposed, and because they rigidly ad-
here to the true pi inciples of (he Kansas-Nobiaskci
bill, w1hc.1i guaranties to the people the ri^htto
form and regulate their domestic institutions in
theii own way, sulijei^t only to t'ie Constitution
of the TImted States. 1 look, Mr. Ohanman,
with feaiful forebodings to the future, if opinions
are to be changed for offices or patronage in the
gift of the President: if the principle of popular
sovereignty is to he set aside, and the rights of
the people of o Territory disregarded, because the
President, on tb', ground of expediency, recom-
mends it, while he admits that the opposite course
is just, are we not on the road which, if pur-
sued, wili lead to despotism or dissolution?
'I he President, m his annual message, says:

tion^, uiid saye, in ins letter to the Indiana De-
mocracy, m spooking of iiis pledges that the con-
stirutiou should he submitted to a vote of the

Governor Yv"a'kvr jiroeeeds to arr^ue the case.
He grows indignantand eloquent as he considers
how this case is treated by the Executive;
" Where are we, and in what direction are we drifting*
Are we upon the banks of the Bospoi us or Danube, or upon
soil consecrated to popular sovereignty by the blood of the
Revolution ? Is it Executive edicts or sovereign nghtsthat
constitute the liberties of our country? Aie we Yicemen
I 4 who know our rights, and knowing dare maintain.' or are
we vassais, serfs, or slaves, palace slaves, that will cringe
or change at the stamp of the foot of a master t lb it the
people and the Stales, as represented io the Senate and
House of Representatives, who are to record their votes as
indicated bv their unbiased judgment; or are they merely
to icgister Executive cdicts, under penalties for refusal, of
denunciation and prosci>pnon ? Is the President the master
or seivant of the people, that he should iha.s dictate to them
oi then Representatives, under threats ofexclu^on from the
party of their choice 5 is Demociacy a name and shadow,
oi a substance? Jt means the power of the people. This
is its vital e^enee. Or has it ):ost il< nue signification, or
are we moving fiom n whit vu wlcss but rapid studes to
wauU despotic powei, to make and uim>ake the rules of
political faith under pains and penalties abhoient to the
ton Is ot fieetnen ? Ic tins the eij?lHy--second year of our In

It is clear, by his instructions to Governor
Walker, that the President designed to have the
constitution which should be framed by the con-
vention, submitted to the people for theii' decision,
and that they should be protected m the expres-
sion of their wishes at tlu* ballot box, for or
against the constitution, lii'sptesent opinion is,
that Kansas should be admitted under the Le-
compton constitution, on the ground of expedi-
ency. Re regrets fh.it it was not submitted to
the people for their action, but thinks if will be
sufficient to satisfy justice, to submitto them one
clause of that instt umcnt. We differ from him
in this opinion. The convention migla "jeiter
have refused the whole, thun to select one clause
and say that was the only pai t upon which the
people should vote. The course pursued by the
convention is an arbitraly a.ssutnption of power,
not warranted by the act, railing a convention,
nor by the principles of the Kansas-Nebraska act,
and is m violation of fhe spirit and genius of our
institutions; and is such a course as might be ex-
pected only from a despot who dared not trust
his subjects to express their wishes m relation to
a matter m which their dearest rights and inter-
ests were involved.
I ask, Mr. Chairman, are those of us who are
opposed to the Lecompton constitution to be de-
nounced as renegades and traitors to the party,
while we stand upon the principle which the
President himself says is ri^ht; and because we
' are unwilling to viekl that principle on the ground
j of expediency ?
Talk, Mr. Chairman, about reading the anti-
Leeompton men out of the Demociatic party!
When you read out such men as Governor Wise,
Governor Walker, Stanton, Bancroft, Senator
Douglas, and other prominent Democrats op-
pohed to this constitution, when you expel the
; Detnoctac.y of Illinois, with the iank and file
i throughout the country, the Democratic party
; will be as powerless as was Samson when shorn
j of his locks.

I read from a letter of an old editor, addressed
to the editor of the States, to show the position of
the German papers in the Union on the Lecomp-
