as stated by him. It was taken by Sergeant-Major Clark and Privates Wilcox and Parker, of the Fourth Michigan, about 1 1/2 miles beyond the camps. They at the same time captures a wagon and took 3 prisoners.

I beg to make special mention of Lieutenant O'Connell, of the Fourth U. S. Cavalry, for the very gallant manner in which he led his squadron, driving the enemy out of both their camps with his small force, and I regret exceedingly that one of those mistakes which will sometimes occur in the best-regulated families prevented his being properly supported.

I have also to mention Sergeant Owens, Corpl. J. Bartlett, Privates C. E. Smith and S. Riggin, of Company K, and Corpl. J. Miller, of Company E, Fourth U. S. Cavalry, and Private J. W. Royce, of Company G, Third Indiana Cavalry, as the small squad who distinguished themselves by capturing the piece of artillery. All of these men were taken prisoners, except Riggin and Royce.

There were some 300 or 400 horses in the camps when the Fourth Regulars and Fourth Michigan passed through them, but they were taken possession of by the regiments which followed.

The brigade captured 70 prisoners, 3 of whom are commissioned officers.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
