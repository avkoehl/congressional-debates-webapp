General Wright says he has placed seven Illinois regiments at your command. A large body of new levies will be collected as soon as possible at Memphis. General McPherson is promoted. Report others who deserve it.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

BOLIVAR, [TENN., October 8, 1862].

Major-General GRANT:

Order for Ross' movement received. Two companies Illinois cavalry, one regiment, and one section will move, flying light, to seize and hold Davis' Mill Bridge; the rest of the column will follow rapidly. I think Mack's regiment (Seventy-sixth Illinois) had better remain here, and perhaps the Twelfth Wisconsin. Mack has no haversacks for provisions.

A. S. HURLBUT.

BOLIVAR, [TENN., October] 8, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I have just heard from Holly Springs. There are no forces there; all left on Sunday. There is about one company of cavalry at Davis' Mill to destroy the railroad bridge, if no more. Everything in shape of force above Wolf River has moved south. I am of opinion that the rout of Van Dorn's army is complete, and that Pillow's force, late at Holly, has caught the panic. Ross moves to-night and will await further orders at La Grange and Grand Junction, which he is ordered to occupy by morning.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,October 8, 1862.

Brigadier-General McARTHUR:

If Hurlbut's division is pushing for Ripley you may follow McPherson by Nolin's toward Hatchie, where there is water, and pushing to Blackland.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

[H. G. KENNETT,]

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

CAIRO, ILL., October 8, 1862-10.35 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

General Grant telegraphs me that he wants at least twenty regiments as soon as they can possibly be got. Governor Yates has not got them ready to move. Cannot General Curtis or the Governor of Iowa send some? I have telegraphed General Wright.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
