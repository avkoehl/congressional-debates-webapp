General LORING,

Canton:

Lee will cover Canton with a brigade. He will not cross Pearl River, but move to take the rear of the enemy as soon as assured of your crossing. Will send some cavalry to cover rear should enemy cross after you. Lee will be on the Jackson road for your orders, and he will then give to the left. I am across the river and shall move toward Brandon.

General LORING:

Telegraphed General Polk of our intended movements. Told him horses for the artillery and the wagons had not arrived. General Lee answered it would be useless to give battle against such odds.

Major-General LORING,

Canton:

Detain the enemy as long as possible from getting into Jackson. I will send 6,000 infantry as soon as they can reach you; they will be concentrated in Brandon. The advance left yesterday evening; the greater part of the residue leave this morning. I leave on my return this evening and will be at the front with you. Say nothing of this re-enforcement. Send this by special courier to General Lee.

Your dispatch received. It is impossible to comply. The enemy, 25,000 strong, entered Clinton this morning at 10.30. Loring will cross above and I am across on this side. Lee will swing to the left and harass the enemy in flank and rear. Loring's force left Canton this morning for Madison Station.
