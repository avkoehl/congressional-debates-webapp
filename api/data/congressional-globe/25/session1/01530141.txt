would, with alacnty, smieni'ei my ovvn opinion at
the feet of my constituents.
Sir, there ic no pressing necessity for the imme-
diate passage of this bill The Government is now
going on receiving and disbursing its revenue in
the same mannei as provided m the bill Should
it now pass, it will pioduce no change Since the
suspension of spec e payments, the Government
has met with no difficulty in the management of
its fiscal operations, neither can it foi six short
weeks, at which time the bill can be acted on, un-
der the influence oí a well infonneil and plainly
expressed public op.mon It has been my mis-
fortune not to have enjoyed an mierchatige of sen-
timent with my consumen s, as have n ost of the
gentlemen of this House Business ot a private,
but pressing nature, has entirely separated me from
them since April last I wish to obey their will,
and for this purpose I should be glad, bv a perso-
nal interview, to asceitam that will, and «hen as-
certained, 1 shall not fail to execute tt
Mr Clark then, according to the pledge he had
given, renewed the mo l ion to lay the billon the
table
Mi CONNOR then moved a call of the House,
and upon the motion asked for the y eas and nays,
which were ordered, and were—veis  186, navs 5
The call bem; ordered, w as proceeded in, through
several stages, till 222 members h\4 icspnnded to
their names, when, on mot) n of Mr CHAM-
BCRS of Kentucky , it w >s suspended—171 to 30
The quest c n ihen íecui ling to bv the bi 1 theon
table, thereupon,
Mr. GRF.NNCLL asked fcr the jcas and najs,
which weie oulercd
Mi LEWIS asked the gentleman w ho mad< the
trotion, to withdraw it, so as to permit an im nd-
ment to be submitted,uInch vvou d put the bill m i
foim less object onable to a numbei of members
Mr WILIIAM8 shou'd like, he said, very much
to iccommodate the gentlpn n, but there wcie a
dozen others w ho would also w ish to be accommo-
dated in the same way, and he, therefoie, could
not assent to the request
Several gentlemen wishe i to have the amend-
ment read, but it was ruled to be out of order pend-
ing the motion to lay on the table
The question was then taken, and decided in the
affirmative—)eas 120, nays 107, as fillows

He then alluded to an item, m the bill then before
the committee, in which $10 000 was appropriated
for expenses attending the foreign agencv at Lon-
don m rc'ation to lha Smithsonian bequest. He
contended that there was no necessity for Di Rush
to remain at London at such an extravagant out-
Hy, and moved to strike out that item ftom the bill
He adverted to the present distress ol the eountry,
and asked how the Committee of Wajsand Means
could think of smuggling in such an item at this
time He considered it a most piodigal expendi-
ture
Mr CAMBRELENG said the gentleman had
applied the wotd "humbuggery" to the athnmistia-
lion, and had chaiged them with attempting to
smuggle the item in question thiough the House.
But he would tell the gentleman he was m staken,
and it vv as not the first tune he had m ssed his mark
A pipei had been 1\ ing on their 'ables for more

cettiiuly showed anj thing but a desire to -.mnggie
