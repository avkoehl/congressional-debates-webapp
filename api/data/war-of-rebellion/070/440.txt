Captain BURLEIGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My cavalry is out and has not reported, but I don't think that there is any force near us. General Kelley telegraphed to me for coffee for 1,250 veterans going east.

Colonel, Commanding.

MARTINSBURG, May 12, 1864.

Captain BURLEIGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have no further reason to think there is any force near us. Part of the men mentioned in my telegram turned out to be our own cavalry from Kearneysville, searching for arms and out of uniform. I still think there may be some of Mosby's men about. My cavalry has not yet returned; will report when they do. Shall be glad to have the re-enforcements, but the general need not be anxious. I have barricades at all streets not absolutely necessary.

R. S. RODGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
