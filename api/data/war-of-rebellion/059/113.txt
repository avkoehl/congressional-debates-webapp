ATHENS, March 22, 1864.

Brigadier General T. W. SWEENY,

Pulaski:

Forrest has a pontoon bridge and will cross and attack north of here, at the same time that Decatur is attacked. Order all forces on railroad to hold their position under my and all circumstances. If they stick to their stockades, nothing can defeat them. We must be very watchful and hold our works. I will take care of Decatur.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, March 22, 1864.

Colonel AUGUST MERSY,

Pulaski:

Phillips yesterday had a running fight for 14 miles with Clanton. He lost 4 men killed and 8 wounded and taken prisoners; Sergeant Hartman, Company B, among the killed. The rebels were too strong for him, and forced him to fall back. He brought in some 20 prisoners.

Respectfully,

J. W. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ATHENS, March 22, 1864.

Major-General LOGAN,

Huntsville:

Major-General Clanton's advance is at Somerville-two brigades, fifteen pieces artillery; General Roddey's, tow brigades, advance at Summit. General Forrest trying to cross at or above Eastport. General Jackson, with brigade, on Moulton road. This brigade is part of the force that was at Mount Hope. Scouts with them report to-night that they attack Decatur, while Forrest, if he succeeds in crossing, attacks railroad; they evidently mean mischief.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, March 22, 1864.

Brigadier General W. SOOY SMITH,

Chief of Cavalry, Nashville:

I have pushed my mounted force down both sides of the Tennessee River. On south side enemy is very strong. Nothing as yet on north side to stop us. There is no doubt but that they are preparing for some kind of raid. I captured some of Roddey's officers this morning, but they are mum. My mounted force is very small, but will keep it at work. I cannot tell whether Forrest has got all his force in the valley or not. See dispatches to Sawyer for what is south and southeast. If you make any move with cavalry please advise me so far as it will tend to keep me posted, that I may act understandingly.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
