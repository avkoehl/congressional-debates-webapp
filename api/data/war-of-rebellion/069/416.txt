General S. WILLIAMS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

I have just had sent to me by Lieutenant-Colonel Biggs, quartermaster at this post, an order of General Halleck to him that all pontoon bridging that arrives here shall be sent to General Butler. I, therefore, propose when the pontoons arrive, as is not the case as yet, to send some 150 to 200 men with them to General Butler, and retain here the balance of the brigade, with the special material, trains, &c., for your further orders. This I presume to be what you would desire.

General Benham, with the Engineer Brigade of the Army of the Potomac, is here awaiting orders from General Grant or Meade.
