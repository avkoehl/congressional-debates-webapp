Reconstruction—Mr. Harris.
Ho. op Reps.
they are to be elected*, and as to the rules and
regulations under which such persons are to be
elected, so the people of these States may be in
accordance with this bill, and in the discretion of
the Presidentreduced to and held under the power
pf a Governor alone-, so long as the President and
Governor may desire, and more, to that of such
Governor, with or without such other officers as
the President may determine, so long as such
(Governor may wish, without regard to the desire
oraction ofthe President or any other person or
power, which, in the one event would be the most
perfect of despotisms, the government of one man;
and in the other, the next, that of the government
of one man and such others as another man may
appoint; and in eithercase to endure with the will
of the Governor; in the choice of none of whom
could the people, so degradedand tortured,exer-
cise any preference, not being permitted to vote,
nor represented in any legislative body.
Why do 1 assert that such people may be so
governed? Because the President would not be
bound by the bill to appoint for any of such States
any other officer than a Governor, and such other
officers provided for by the laws of the State,
when its government, as is therein stated, was
overthrown, as he might find necessary for the
civil administration of the State, of which he
Would be the only judge, and therefore would not
be compelled to appoint any other than a Gov-
ernor. And as the bill provides that so soon as
the military resistance to the United States shall
have been suppressed in any State, and the people
thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their
obedience to the Constitution and laws of tthe
United States, the Governor shall cause an enroll-
ment to be taken preparatory to the election of
delegates to a constitutional convention, of which
suppression and obedience he is the sole judge,
and consequently not bound ever to have such
enrollment taken, without which there can be no
election or convention, although such resistance
may have ceased and such obedience be ever so
perfect, and every man in the world might desire
that he should. If to this it should be replied
that *he President can discharge the man acting
as Governor and appoint his successor, I would
reply that he, no more than his predecessor,
would umlerany circumstances be bound to cause
such enrollment to bo taken. But suppose the
Governor does, and a constitution is framed in
"conformity with the bill, and Congress refuses to
recognize their government as republican in
form, a Governor, under the provisions of the bill,
would have to govern it as if no such constitution
Jhad been framed, as the bill requires that the gov-
ernment of each of such States is to be ad ministered
•by a Governor, with such other officers as I have
named, as the President might find necessary for
the purpose, until it has, as therein provided, es-
tablished a government which the United States
shall have recognized as republican in form. And
should a bill be passed by Congress so recognizing
such government, and the President veto it, such
Slate would, under the provisions of this bill, be
so governed, unless the bill should be passed by a
majotity of two thn ds of each House of Congress,
•which would no£ be probable unless there were
such or near such a majority in each House op-
posed to the Administration, as such question
■would ordinarily be a party one under such an
Administration as this.
If to tins it issaid that no State can be admitted
into the Union without the passage of a bill by
Congress and its approval by the President, or pas-
sage by a vote of two thirds of each House thereof,
in case he vetoes it, I should say that the admis-
sion of a State into the Union piesented no such
question, in which I would be sustained by this
biil, which recognizes them as States in the Union.
And if further said that no bill can become a law
of Con'gress without such approval, or being so
passed, I wou'ld reply that Congress has no power
go to legislate with regard to any State of the
Union, and that therefore the probability of such
contingencies may be properly urged against its so
doing, while it should not be against legitimate
legislation; and I believe, from my knowledge of
the machinations of those who control the admin-
istration of this Government, that most of them
would embrace the opportunity which the pas-
Bage and executive approval of this bill would
give them of so tyrannizing over the people of such
States, for the gratification of the hatred of them-
selves sfad adherents to the people of such States,
not only on account of some of their institutions,
but of their detestation of the reserved rights of
the States, both which,until the incoming of this
Administration, have ever been sanctioned not
only by all the departments of this Government
and all its statesmen, but professedly by this Ad-
ministration, through the legislative and executive
departments of the Government,as from the action
of the Executive further appears from an extract
from a dispatch of the Secretary of State of April
10, 1861, to our minister to Great Britain , written
by the direction ofthe President, and which is as
follows:
"You will not be allowed, however, even if you were
disposed, as the Pje&ident is sure you will not be, to rest
your opposition to tho application of the confederate States
on the ground of any favor this Administration or the paity
which chiefly called it into existence [referring,doubtless,
to the abolition party] pioposos to show to Gieat Britain
or claims that Great Britain ought to show to them ; you
will not consent to draw into debate before the British Gov-
ernment any opposing moial piineiples which may be sup-
posed to lie at the foundation of the controversy between
those States and the Federal Union; yon will indulge m
no expressions of harshness, or disrespect, or even impa-
tience, concerning the seceding States, their agents, or
their people ; but you will, on the continry, all the while
remember that these States aie now, as they always here-
tofore have been, and, notwithstanding their temporary
seif-delusion, they must always continue to be, equal and
honored members of tins Federal Union, and that their citi-
zens, throughout all political misunderstanding and alien-
ation^, still are and always must be our kindred and coun-
tiymen. In short, all your arguments must belong to one
of three classes, namely: first, arguments diawn from the
principles of public law and natural justice winch regulate
the intercourse of equal St.ues; secondly,arguments which
concern equally the honor, welfare, and happiness of the
discontented States and the honor, welfare", and happiness
ofthe whole Union; thirdly, aigumeuts which are equally
conservative of the lights and interests and even hcntt-
ments of the United Stale*, and just in their bearing upon
the rightsj interest*, and sentiments of Gieat Britain and
all other nations."
The bill declares that all persons declared free
by any proclamation of the President shall be for-
ever free; am) if restrained of liberty under pre-
tense of claim to their service or labor, the courts
of the United States shall on habeas corpus dis-
charge them. Such courts compose one of the three
departments of this Government—the judicial;
and while they are termed coordinate, the decis-
ions of the Supreme Court of the United States
are the highest national authority on all questions
of which it has cognizance, and no act or enact-
ment of Congress, or act of the Executive—the
other two departments of the Government—or
cither is, if m contravention of such a decision,
valid. Yet this bill, by providing that such courts
shall on habeas corpus discharge such person, com-
mands them to, although it is one of the preroga-
tives of such courts to determine whether any
enactment of Congress is a law, and their oath-
bound duty to, if they believe it unconstitutional,
to declare it a nullity. And the judgment of the
Supreme Court of the United States is final and
conclusive thereof. Were it not, our Constitu-
tion would be inoperative upon the other two
departments of the Government, and the people
would be subjected to their unrestrained will, and
consequently not free, nor the Government re-
publican. Would not such a command be most
audacious, even did such slave become free by
the provisions of this bill, should it receive the
sanctions necessary to make laws, or had they by
any proclamation of the President? Because it is
an attempt to deprive those courts of a right in-
herent with every court, which is the exercise of
judgment, without which there can be really no
decision, as the decision of a court is but the de-
termination of the judgment of the judge, or ofthe
necessary concurring number of them where the
court is composed of more than one, expressed in
proper form; and if so audacious in such case,
how inexpressibly so, if they did not nor would
so become free. The Representatives in this
House of the then called Republican, now Admin-
istration party, on 11th February, A. D. 1861,
when they were in the majority, voted nearly
unanimously for the following resolutions, which
were passed with few dissenting votes:
"Resolved, That neitherthe Fedeial Government nor the
people or governments of the non-slavehoidmg States have
a purpose or a constitutional right to legislate upon or in-
terfere with slaveiy m any ofthe Stages ofthe Union.
u Resolved, That those persons in the North who do not
subscribe to the foregoing proposition are too insignificant
in number and influence to excite the serious attention or
alarm of any portion of the IlepuDlic, and that the increase
of their numbers and influence does not keep pace with the
increase ofthe aggregate population ofthe Union."
And on the 3d of March, 1863, passed abill au-
thorizing the President, whenever in his judg-
ment the public safety might require it* to sus-
pend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in
any case throughout the United Stales, or any
part thereof, during the present rebellion, in vio-
lation ofthe Constitution, which'authorizes Con-
gress to only when in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety may require it, but not to con-
fer such right on the Presidentorany one. That
Congress may, on believing such necessity to ex-
ist, suspend such privilege is, I suppose, scarcely
if at all questioned. If so, how can it be main-
tained that in the power so to determine with re-
gard to and so suspend a writ of such vast im-
portance, is included thatofdelegating such power
to any, and yet it is not even assumed that the
power so to determine or suspend, or to empower
another to, is conferred in any other part of the
Constitution?
So, though by that resolution the representa-
tives of that party nearly unanimously held that
they m the North who thought that the Federal
Government had the constitutional right to in-
terfere with slavery in any of the States of the
Union were insignificant in number and influ-
ence; and if the Federal Government cannot con-
stitutionally so interfere how can Congress by
legislation or the President by proclamation? And
such representatives so provided for the suspen-
sion of the writ of habeas eoi~pus by their Presi-
dent for which he issued such proclamation, and
most of the leaders of that party are through it
and this bill and like means endeavoring to abol-
ish slavery and establish for the negro superi-
ority of civil rights by requiring such judges to
discharge any of them on writ of habeas corpus
for their freedom, while imprisoning white men
opposed to such designs without informing them,
though beseeched to, of the cause thereof, and
denying,to them such writ and therefore the privi-
lege through a trial and the judgment of a court of
securing their,freedom from the confines of felons'
cells, though extending to the negro an immunity
thereupon neverasked norenjoyed by white men,
who consider the privilege of such writ, which
only entitles any one to a trial on which he may or
may not be discharged, one of the greatest of polit-
ical lights and only guarantee ofthe freedom of
persons; and of which all are in certain cases
deprived by those endeavoring to secure for the
uegto such discharge and fieedom in violation of
the Constitution and lawsas previously construed
by themselves, the courts, and all juiists and
statesmen, in disregard of the judgment of the
court required to order such discharge, and conse-
quently through perjury of any judge who should
order such a discharge believing this act and the
proclamation of emancipation to be unconstitu-
tional. And in all cases without trial, as a trial
by a court implies the nghtof the judge to decide,
which in such a case would result in a xemand or
discharge.
And although the President, after the com-
mencement of the war, instructed his Secretary
of State to say in a dispatch to our minister to
France, 22d April, 1861, that any efFoit on hia
part to so interfere with slavery, as existing un-
der the Constitution and laws, would be uncon-
stitutional, and all his acts in that direction would
be prevented by the judicial authority, even
though they were assented to by Congress and
the people, and in one thereafter, I think to our
minister to Great Britain, the date of which I do
not lemember, that
" Tt seeing as if the extreme advocate? of slavery and its
most vehement opponents were acting in concert together
to precipitate a st rvile war, the former by making the most
desperate attempts to overthrow the Fedeial Union, the
latter by demanding an edict of universal emancipation as
a lawkilaud net-es^uy, if not, as they say, the only iegtti>
mate way of saving the Union."
And in resisting a pressure made upon himfor^
the issuing of such an one, but a short time be-
fore he proclaimed it, said that it would be inop-
erative, and has repeatedly, and I suppose always
when expressing ^determination to adhere to it,
or requiring oaths to support or obey it, so qual-
ified such determination, support, and obedience*
