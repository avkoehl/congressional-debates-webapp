HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS, May 8, 1864-7 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: So smoky this morning we can see nothing. Shall I make a reconnaissance with a regiment or less, in front of Ross, to see if we can find out whether the enemy are still there in front of his right.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS, Mrs. Reed's House, Ga., May 8, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of yesterday, directing a reconnaissance to be made at 6 o'clock this morning, only reached me this moment. Directions will be instantly given for a brigade to threaten Buzzard Roost to develop the enemy's strength and position, without becoming engaged with him unless he comes out from behind his defenses.

In consequence of the dense smoke in this valley, I trust the delay in receiving your dispatch will prove no serious disappointment to the major-general commanding. Small scouting parties have been out all the morning. The cavalry and one brigade of infantry left for Villanow at sunrise. Have received no report from them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-Colonel Asmussen will accompany you.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. PERKINS,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
