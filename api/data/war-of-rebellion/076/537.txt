Lieutenant Colonel R. R. TOWNES,

Assistant Adjutant- General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that nothing unusual occurred in my front to- day. The enemy seems to have had a new set of men on his skirmish line to- day, who were inclined to fire more than yesterday, and were less careful about exposing themselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
