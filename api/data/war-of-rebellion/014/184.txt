WASHINGTON CITY, May 21, 1862.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

Your long dispatch of yesterday [to-day] just received.* You will have just such control of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate. McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats, if the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be resisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at Richmond. By land he can reach you in two weeks, judging by past experience. Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days after I ordered it.

A. LINCOLN,

President United States.

McCLELLAN'S, May 21, 1862 - 12.10 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Notwithstanding rain of last night, everything has advanced except headquarters camp. Franklin is at Cold Harbor, 3 miles from New Bridge; Porter a few miles behind him. Our light troops have crossed at Bottom's Bridge, and reconnaissance now being pushed beyond to ascertain position of enemy. All goes well. Weather is again cloudy. I am starting for Bottom's Bridge and Cold Harbor, returning to this camp to night.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
