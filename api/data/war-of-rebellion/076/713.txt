HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,August 30, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

SIR: I am now (1.15 p. m.) at the forks of the East Point road and the road crossing the railroad and leading to Widow Long's. the Fourth Corps is just ahead of me, and going on the latter road. I am going in position. The ground is not very good, and the connections with the Newnan road make the left especially weak. I shall keep as much reserve as I can consistently with covering the railroad and the little commanding ground on the left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

I find the Fourth Corps is not all out yet, and have overtaken them less than half a mile from my former position. I was misinformed when I sent my message by your orderly, and hasten to correct it. I will send you word they really get off.

Yours, &c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Please report to the commanding general as soon as possible whether it is possible for you to march by the road above indicated, and, if you find it cannot be done, move as directed last night, in the rear of the infantry.
