Answer. I had no immediate command of Harper's Ferry at the time of its surrender. Previous to that my command extended from the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia to Wheeling.

Question. At what time did Harper's Ferry cease to be a part of your command?

Answer. About the 12th of September.

Question. Three days before the surrender?

Answer. Yes, sir; I immediately answered that order, and wrote to General Halleck that he or General McClellan could take all the troops from the Relay House up to Martinsburg, or even beyond that - to Martinsburg, at all events. I stated the number of troops at that time. When I wrote that letter I did not know that General White had fallen back or retreated, and joined Colonel Miles' command; which I had previously directed him to do in case he should be attacked by an overwhelming force.

Question. Will you state to the Commission what measures, if any, were taken under your directions, or were suggested by you, looking to the preparation of Harper's Ferry for defense against the enemy?

Answer. I have orders here and telegrams from Colonel Miles and my answers to them. They are as follows:
