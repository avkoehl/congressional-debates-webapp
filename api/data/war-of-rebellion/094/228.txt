In our rejoicing at the defeat of the enemy thanks are due to the Almighty for his protection to our gallant officers and soldiers in the great conflict they have passed through. The report of General Thomas, and also an unofficial report* containing interesting details, are subjoined.

Nothing has been heard from General Thomas to-day. Unofficial dispatches state that the provost-marshal at Nashville reports 5,000 prisoners and 49 pieces of artillery as being already secured. It is ascertained that in transmitting General Thomas' report last night a telegraphic mistake was made at Louisville or Nashville in the estimated number of our casualties. The dispatch written by General Thomas stated that his whole loss would not exceed 3,000, and very few were killed.

Our loss not over 300.+ Sherman took Fort McAllister Wednesday. If you start soon there is yet time for your report to be made as promised. Details will be sent you soon as possible, but the telegraph works badly. Dispatches from Foster are being received, and a messenger with sealed dispatches from Sherman has reached Fortress Monroe on his way up.
