Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

At dark ten vessels in all, were at Battery Island, landing troops from some of them. I do not know if any came up afterward. Thus far no news that any have landed at Grimball's, or higher up the river. I have it well watched. My dispositions are made, but I want infantry terribly on west lines.

C. H. SIMONTON,

Colonel, Commanding.
