some horses and arms, together with the roster and records of Colonel Coffee's regiment, but that the enemy appearing in overwhelming force he was compelled to evacuate the town, and while falling back kept up a running fight, during which Surgeon Reynolds was taken prisoner by the enemy.

There are all kinds of reports, and from the best information I can get there are about 1,500 rebels in and about Montevallo, and they will march for this place if they think themselves strong enough. They may or may not come. I am fully prepared, and can hold our position against any force they can bring against us if they have no artillery; and, will do it anyway. My present force is as follows:

Ohio cavalry, under Major Miner:

Mounted ......................................... 120

Dismounted ...................................... 532

-----

652

Captain Shorter's [First Lieutenant Schaurte?]

company, Sixth Kansas ................................ 62

Captain Van Sickle's company, Sixth Kansas ........... 50

Third Regiment Wisconsin Cavalry ..................... 220

-----

984

These not including Captain Conkey's company, lately at Carthage, who have not reported here yet, and are supposed to be doing good work among the rebels in Bourbon County.

I have sent word to Colonel Salomon that it will be impossible to forward supply trains to him at present without he sends sufficient escort to protect the trains. They (the Indian Fourth) are rationed up full to the 14th of this month.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. S. HENNING,

Major Third Wisconsin Cavalry, Commanding Post.
