HEADQUARTERS Cavalry BRIGADE, Hagerstown, Md., July 14, 1863.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders from Brigadier-General Gregg, commanding Second Division, Cavalry Corps, I proceeded to Chambersburg, Pa., for the purpose of assuming command of the First New York and Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry, doing duty in that vicinity, and removing them to the headquarters of the Second Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac. While at Chambersburg, and on the evening of the 12th instant, at 10 o'clock, I received orders from Major-General Couch, whose headquarters are at that place, to take command of that portion of Major-General Milroy's division that were in Pennsylvania, at and about Chambersburg, Loudon, and Greencastle, and march the same to the Army of the Potomac. In obedience therewith, I had said force concentrated and moved to this place, where I arrived this evening. Finding the position of the Army of the Potomac changed, I deemed it advisable to await at his point further orders as to my advance, which I now respectfully ask. With this object in view, I have taken the liberty of dispatching to your headquarters Lieutenant Watkins, of the First New York Cavalry. I beg to submit the following statement, exhibiting the character and strength of the command, viz:
