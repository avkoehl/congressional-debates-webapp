HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 16, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report one rebel deserter just received -name, Emil Leath. He belongs to Graham's four-gun battery of horse artillery; has been stationed at Stony Creek, but is now on the march to Roney's Mill, where it is to go into camp. Three brigades of Lee's cavalry are with the battery; all going into camp between Roney's Mill and Dinwiddie Court-House. This deserter thinks the rebel troops more demoralized than ever before. They will fight, but not so well as heretofore. He knows of no movement of troops except as above; has heard nothing definite of Sherman; rumors very contradictory.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 16, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Three deserters have just arrived-one Forty ninth Virginia Infantry, and two Fifty-eight Virginia Infantry, all of Colonel Kasey's brigade, Walker's division, Gordon's corps. They report that Gordon's corps has been moved to the front of Petersburg ant its place supplied by Bushrod Johnson's division. They report the rebel soldiers as very disconsolate, and many of the officers have lost confidence. A guard is now kept in the rear of the rebel troops to prevent desertions to the rear. These men will be forwarded immediately to army headquarters.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
