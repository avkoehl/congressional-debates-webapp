HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,Camp Milton, April 15, 1864.

Colonel TABB, Commanding, &amp;c., Waldo:

COLONEL: The movements of the enemy at Jacksonville indicate a purpose on his part to make a raid upon some of our communications or depots of supply. It is believed that his designs are upon the Florida Railroad and the depots in Marion, Sumter, and Alachua Counties, which he supposes to contain a considerable amount of stores. It will be your province to defeat him in this object in every manner possible with the means at your control. For this purpose, in addition to the regiment and battalion of infantry and the section of artillery with the Fourth Georgia Cavalry, now with you, the major-general commanding has ordered to yo another section of Gamble's artillery, 250 cavalry, and two battalions of infantry. The artillery and cavalry are now en route for your headquarters, and the infantry will be sent by rail to Waldo, as soon as the transportation for that purpose can be obtained. With this force it is believed you cannot only foil the enemy in his purposes, but by activity, energy, and skill, can punish him severely for his temerity, if not capture or destroy the most of his party. His plans and purposes not having been fully developed it is not deemed advisable to give you specific instructions as to your movements and disposition of forces. It is supposed that you will keep yourself fully advised of the enemy's movements in your front and one your flanks. To do this your vedettes, pickets, and scouts must be vigilant and active. Your good judgment will enable you to act intelligently upon information thus obtained, keeping constantly in view the main object, viz, to defeat the rail and punish as severely as possible its projectors. it is possible that the force at Palatka may move out in your front with a view of holding your forces in position, while the raiders do their work on your flanks and rear. Should this opportunity present itself, and you feel yourself able to accomplish it by a vigorous attack of this main force with all your strength, you may defeat it completely and then the raiders will be at your mercy.

The raiding party which left Jacksonville is believed to consist of about 400 or 500 mounted infantry, under Colonel Guy V. Henry; he perhaps has a light battery also with him. Some of the men are provided with picks, crowbars, &c., for the purpose of destroying the railroad. The major-general commanding has entire confidence in your skill, energy, and courage in this important work intrusted to you, and believes that your success will be qual to his hopes.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
