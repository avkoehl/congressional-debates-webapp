Invention of Steamboats—Mr. Rumsey.
Ho. or Reps.
cu cumstances, he succeeded, in the autumn of
1784, in making a private, but very imperfect ex-
periment, in order to test some of the principles
of his invention And, notwithstanding much of
his machinery was so utterly defective as quickly
to fail in many parts, and to leqiure renewal
and reconstruction throughout, yet so well con-
vinced was he of ultimate success from this ex-
periment, that, at the October session of the Vir-
ginia Legislatuie for that year, he applied for,
and obtained, an act guarantying to him the
exclusive use of his invention in navigating the
waters of that State This will be seen by refer-
ence to the statutes of that Commonwealth. About
the same time, also, he communicated his inven-
tion to General Washington, as appears by a let-
ter of that personage, the original of which was
before the committee, dated November, 1787, to
the late Governor Johnson, of Maryland. It
seems that he did not earlier make this commu-
nication to Washington because he had not ma-
tured and digested his plan, or tested its truth by
any, even partial, experiments. And when he
did make it, so new,so bold,so original and un-
heal d of was it, that Washington declares in that
letter that he considered it " rather as an ebulli
tion of his genius" than as anything likely to be
available.
In the beginning of the next year, (January,
1785,) he obtained a patent fiom the Geneial
Assembly of Maryland for navigating by steam
the bays and rivers of that State, and immedi-
ately aftei wards commenced preparations for an
experiment on alargerscale Through the whole
of this year he was deeply engaged in building a
boat, and procuring, improving, adapting, and
testing the several paits of his machinery He
did not, however, from the causes which I have
before mentioned, get readv for a public tual
until the year following, (1786,) which, all things
considered, was eminently successful     This ex-
Eeriment was made on the Potomac, near Shep-
erdstown, Virginia, in the presence ofhundieds
of spectators     It is proven by various witnesses
It is des< nbed in the letter of Mr  Bedmger, and
certified   by  Dr   Alexander, of  Balumoie,  for
whose high respectability I refer to such of the
delegation ftom Maryland as are acquainted with
him     The  gentleman  near me  [Mr   Jenifer]
says there is no one more worthy of full confi
dence.    In thi3 trial, he succeeded, notwithst nd
ing the unavoidable imperfection   of his  ma
chinery, in propelling las boat against tne cunent
by steam alone four or Jive miles an hour    There
was long m possession of one of his family an
ancient pamphlet, with high evidences of authen
ticity upon its face, which I have often read, and
the general contents of which, I know, ate rcc
ollected by many persons in Kentucky, contain-
ing the approbatory certificates of numeious gen-
tlemen who witnessed this exhibition, amongst
them, that of General  Gates, as mentioned by
Mi   Bedinger    This pamphlet has been lost or
mislaid, and those interested have been unable to
repossess themselves of it, or to obtain another
copy
But, independent of this mass of testimony, the
proof before the committee as to this expenment
i$ so clear, so ample and conclusive, that no one
can read it and doubt The results of this trial
weie by no means discouraging So far fiom it,
that, says Doctor Alexandei, who was on boaid,
"every person present believed that Mr Rumsey
had accomplished all his wishes " The first ef-
foi ts of Fulton in America, more than twenty
yeais after, were but little more successful It
was not until after repeated trials—gieat and ex-
tensive modifications and impiovements, requir-
ing much time and money, and testing to the ut-
most the liberal patronage of Livingston—that he
succeeded in obtaining a velocity reasonably use
ful And even the utmost rapidity with which
he navigated his boats was far, infinitely far, be-
hind that which subsequent improvement has
achieved I speak not this in dispaiagement of
Fu'ton It cannot be so understood Great in-
ventions, íequiring complicate machinery, are
ne\ti peifLcted and seldom made eminently use-
ful at once High excellence is íarely attained
until the mechanical woild has tendered us offer-
ings—poured in its contributions through a long
series of years    Time) labor, money, repeated
modifications and experiments—the conjoint sug-
gestions of practical and theoretical mechanics,
are all prerequisite and auxiliary to the perfec
tion of a great invention Take, for instance,
the printing press of our day, throwing off thou-
sands of aecuiate impiessions in an hour Fiom
its wondrous celenty in multiplying copies,and,
through the agency of steam on the land and the
water, scattering them far and near, it may almost
be compared, in its capacity for the diffusion of
intellectual light, to the sun in the heavens, in his
capacity for shedding physical warmth and radi-
ance upon the world And yet the press of our
day—all admirable as it is—is but the i ude wooden
type and clumsy apparatus of the great German
inventor, in a beautiful, improved and perfected
form
The spinning machine, which has so highly en
couraged one important branch of agriculture, and
so greatly advanced the civilization and happiness
of mankind, by clothing millions m comfort and
decency, who would otherwise have remained in
ragged, squalid degradation—the spinning ma-
chine of our day, all perfect as it is, would scarce
be íecognized as his own by the inventor, Ark
wright, if it were not that the same principle—the
idea of making many threads at once by machine-
ry—is preserved
Gieat, though not equally so, for the same time
has not elapsed, has been the improvement in the
steamboat A hundied minds and a thousand
hands have each contnbuted something to thesim-
plification of its machinery and theextension of its
powbis This is strikingly illustrated on the
western waters, where the early boats of Fulton
were neatly a month m making the tup from New
Orleans to Louisv lie, which is now not unfie-
quently peifotmcd in less than a week It is
equally apparent in the increased speed of the
boats upon the Hudson, as appears from the re-
port of the Secietary of the Treasury on the steam-
engine, laid a few days ago upon our tables
It is piobable, nay, cei tain, that ultimate excel-
lence is not yet attained, and that the steamboats
of the piesent time will bear the same relation to
tho<ie of fifty years hence which the first boats of
Pulton in 1807, or the original boat of Rumsey on
the Potomac in 1786, bear to those of the present
day But this progressive improvement detracts
nothing from the merits either of him who first
drew the attention of mechanical men to the sub-
ject by actual and successful experiment, though
he left it incomplete in consequence of premature
death, noi of him who afterwaids improved upon
and bi ought it into general operation They laid
the foundation, they created the basis of all sub
sequent action There is glory enough m so great
an invention for both—for Rumsey, who origina-
ted the steamboat, and by actual trial proved its
capability, and for Fulton, who subsequently
carried out the grand design, and introduced it
into common use
They—I speak it not lightly or arrogantly, but
from a deep conviction of its sober truth—deserve
to be ranked among the highest benefactois of
their species, higher, far, than nine tenths of the
warriors and statesmen whose achievements blaze
upon the page of history, and occupy so large a
portion of the world's regard and admiration
To say nothing of other nations, ¡/wii-labors have
contnbuted immeasurably to the advancement of
all the great interests of their country, their la-
bors have added hundreds of millions to its
wealth Sir, vou have no arithmetic of powers
vast enough by which to estimate the benefits of
the steamboat in a pecuniary point of view alone
Their labors have rendered the whole Republic
more prosperous in peace, more powerful and de
fensible in war Their labors, too, have tended,
in no small degree, to the preservation of human
life. I am aware that the truth of this last asser-
tion may not be universally admitted, but it will
scarcely be questioned, at least by a western or
southwestern man who recollects the old mode
of conducting our commerce Small as that com-
merce was befóte the intioduction of the steam-
boat, it drew off a larger portion of population
than is now necessary to transact it, although
so immensely extended Even then more died
in the long and exposed and laborious voyages
m keels and baiges, or the exhausting return by
land under a vertical sun, than now peush from
steamboat explosions But they dropped off one
by one, they sank obscurely into the grave by
the wayside, or, after reaching their homes, fell
victims to disease incurred by a long sojourn and
travel in southern climes The consumption of
life, though known to be great in the aggregate,
happening so much in detail made no impression.
But now every steamboat disaster creates a sen-
sation, and is pioclaimed in the universal press
of the country If the mighty commerce now in
progress on the western waters had to be con-
ducted in the old way, it would require the agency
of so many individuals that it would not be long
before the sides of the public roads, from New
Oilcans to the upper States, and the banks of
that great river which pours into the Gulf the
congregated waters of nearly half a continent,
would be almost continued graveyards
But to return from this digression, in which, as
I promised brevity, I ought not to have indulged.
After his experiment—successful experiment—
upon the Potomac, in 1786, to which I have ad-
verted, Rumsey, being under the strong convic-
tion that skillful workmen and perfect machinery
were alone wanting to the most complete success,
and sensible that such could not then be procured
in America, resolved to go to England With
slender means of his own, and aided—no, not
aided—but mocked and deluded by some timid
and unsteady patronage, he there resumed, with
untiring energy, his great undertaking He pro-
ceeded to procure patents fiom the British Gov-
ernment for steam navigation, and various inven-
tions embracing improved steam-engines and
boilers, those of Watt, and all preceding ones,
being extremely inartificial and imperfect These
patents bear date in the beginning of 1788 Many
of his inventions, in one modified form or an-
other, are now in geneial use As, for instance,
the cylinder-boiler, so superior to the old tub or
still boilers, in the presentation of fire surface,
and capacity for holding highly ranfied steam,
is described, both single and combined, in his
specifications, and is identical in principle with
the tub-boiler which he used in his Potomac ex-
periment
Difficulties and embarrassments of a pecuniary
nature, and others such as invariably obstruct
the progress of a new invention, attended him
in England He was often compelled to abandon,
temporarily, his main object, and turn hisjHten-
tion to something else, in order to raise means to
resume it He undertook, with the same power,
but by its more judicious application, to pro-
duce higher results in several water works, mall
which he succeeded, realizing thereby some rep-
utation, and some funds to apply to his favorite
project
At another time, as mentioned by the commit-
tee in their report, in order to avoid a " London
jail," and the delay, if not defeat, of all his high
hopes, he was compelled to transfer, at what he
considered a ruinous sacrifice, a large interest in
his inventions—a contract which entangled and
embarrassed him during the remainder of hi3
short life Still, however, he struggled on, un-
dismayed, had constructed a boat of about one
hundred tons burden, and pushed forward his
machinery so near to the point of completion as
to be able to indicate a day not very distant for a
public exhibition, when his sudden death ensued
from apoplexy, while discussing the principles of
one of his inventions before a philosophical so-
ciety of London A very interesting account of
the manner of his death is given in the letter of
R C Wakefield, amongst the papers before the
select committee With his life, the whole pro-
ject ceasetí, there was no one present to admin-
ister, there was no one interested in his under-
taking possessed of skill and ability to carry it out.
Most men looked upon it as wild and visionary.
Few would have been willing to incur the ndicule
of attempting to complete it All that he left—
his very boat and machinery—barely sufficed to
satisfy anxious and greedy creditors
With the sudden death of Fiesco, of Genoa, that
most extraordinary revolution which, in a single
night, with admuable ability, he had nearly
effected, ceased, rolled back, became abortive So
did the sudden death of this humbler, but mote
useful man arrest all further piosecution, at the
t.me, of the great object to which he had bo m-
