MOUND CITY, October 25, 1864.

General DAVIES:

Reached here at daylight this morning after a forced and rapid march from Paola. This town had a narrow escape. Enemy's flankers in plan view on the heights around the town when battle opened six miles distant. This has been a crushing day for Price, and his retreat is in great disorder. He is abandoning everything and is so closely pressed I don't think he will be able to molest Fort Scott much. Moonlight moved on enemy's flank for that place at the same moment the battle was fairly begun. I just hear that another battery, and his last, has been taken from the enemy.
