legally entitled to vote for mayor, nor then even longer than necessary for him to vote. These officers and soldiers thus entitled to vote will have passes given them from the headquarters of the post, prior to Saturday night, April 2, except in extraordinary cases when passes will be issued up to the closing of the polls. No officer or soldier shall use his authority as such to interfere in any way with said election or remain at the polls longer than is necessary to vote, when he will return immediately to his command. This order will be read at the head of every company and detachment within the limits of the post of Fort Leavenworth and any violation of it will be noted. The commanding officer of the post will furnish to these headquarters a list of officers and soldiers thus passed to the city for the purpose of voting.

By order of Brigadier-General Davies:

D. J. CRAIGIE,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

On the 3rd of April I received from the mayor of Leavenworth in person, all at the same time, the following communications at my private quarters at the fort:

MAYOR'S OFFICE, LEAVENWORTH, KANS., April 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Commanding District of North Kansas:

DEAR SIR: Sixty or more men are parading our streets armed with knives and revolvers in disregard of the ordinance regarding the carrying of fire-arms. They have assaulted several peaceable citizens, knocking them down. They have brutally beaten the city marshal. I met the rioters and asked them by what authority they carried arms. One of them showed me an appointment from J. L. McDowell, as deputy U. S. marshal; others had no such or any authority. I requested the police force to arrest them. They drew their knives and revolvers and resisted. I ask force to be placed under my orders (say 50 men) at once, sufficient to make the arrest and preserve the peace.

Respectfully, yours,

D. R. ANTHONY,

Mayor.

MAYOR'S OFFICE, LEAVENWORTH, KANS., April 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Commanding District of North Kansas, Fort Leavenworth:

DEAR SIR: I notice by your Orders, Numbers 6, that officers and soldiers are to be passed to this city to vote on the 4th April at our municipal election. No officer or soldier has a right to vote at this election; so the judges also decide, under the constitution of this State. You will confer a favor by retaining all officers and soldiers at Fort Leavenworth on that day.

I remain, sir, your obedient servant,

D. R. ANTHONY,

Mayor.

MAYOR'S OFFICE, LEAVENWORTH, April 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Commanding District of North Kansas.

DEAR SIR: Threats have been made by parties in this city to meet at the polls on the 4th instant, remove the judges of election, legally appointed, and substitute others in their place. This they propose to do by violence. Armed bands of men are now parading the streets; some of them have threatened to shoot the judges of election unless they comply with their demands. I would respectfully request that a force sufficiently strong be sent to each poll, say at 7 a. m. on that day, to protect the judges, clerks, and the legal voters.

I remain, your most obedient servant,

D. R. ANTHONY,

Mayor.

I informed the mayor that I could not place any troop under his command, but that I would send 100 men, under the command of a competent officer, to aid in quelling the riot, if any existed. The mayor left for the city, and I immediately sent Major Hunt, Fifteenth
