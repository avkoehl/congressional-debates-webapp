ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., February 1, 1861.

Major T. H. HOLMES,

Eighth Infantry, Commanding Fort Columbus,

Governor's Island, N. Y.:

SIR: About twenty women and children from Major Anderson's command at Fort Sumter are on their way to New York, and application will probably be made to receive them at Fort Columbus. Should this be the case you will please make them as comfortable as circumstances will permit, and give rations to such as are properly laundresses of companies. If better quarters can be thus secured to them they can be sent to Fort Wood.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I received a letter yesterday from Mr. Gourdin, in which he says: "I saw his excellency this evening, and he makes no objection to your groceries being sent you." The South Carolinians were, we thought, occupied nearly all last night on the works at Cummings Point. One of them is now probably twelve or fifteen feet high, and appears to be bomb-proof, and may be intended to defilade a battery pointing on the channel from our fire. From the energy with which their operations are carried on it is evident that they regard them as very necessary, and that they consider that they are also important, and that they shall be pushed as rapidly as possible. The women and children are on board the steamer, but the wind is blowing so heavily that it is doubtful whether they will attempt to cross the bar with this tied.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Yesterday and last night, in consequence of the continuance of a storm of wind and rain, very little work was done, as far as we could observe, around us. The rain is still [11 a.m.] continuing. The steamer has not yet left the harbor with the women and children.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
