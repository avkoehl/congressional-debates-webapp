of many duties, are not otherwise called on to bear arms in this war. I an my staff will glad to afford them instruction at such times and places as may be most convenient. They will be called on when the enemy in at our doors. I am confident, from my long and intimate association with the men of Wilmington and vicinity, than they are not only willing but eager to fight the invader, and am sure they will do their utmost to the last.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., November 29, 1862.

Major General S. G. FRENCH,

Commanding Department of North Carolina, Petersburg, Va.:

GENERAL: For your information I herewith forward you copy of a letter just received from Brigadier-General Whiting, dated Wilmington, November 18. I request that General Evans be ordered to support General Whiting at Wilmington with his whole force if necessary whenever called upon by General Whiting, provided the support can be given without endangering too much the points guarded by General Evans. You will please send to General Whiting a copy of your instructions to General Evans. I will write to General Whiting instructing him to give to General Evans all the support within his power consistent with his defense of Wilmington in case General Evans should be pressed by the enemy. I fear, however, that until General Whiting shall be re-enforced he will not be able to render much assistance to General Evans now that the fever has bated in Wilmington. The object of this is that in case of an attack by the enemy upon either command there will be perfect co-operation between the commanders.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

G. W. SMITH,

Major-General.
