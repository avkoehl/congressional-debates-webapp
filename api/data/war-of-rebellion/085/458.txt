can be promptly sent from your county? We must give their friends a severe lesson. The crisis is upon us. Either loyalty or disloyalty must prevail in Missouri. Let us sweep the enemies of the Union from the State.

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE W. ANDERSON,

Louisiana:

Raise all the force you can and march across the country toward Mexico to aid us in exterminating the increasing horde of villains who are spreading death and desolation in their bloody pathway. Major Johnston, of the Thirty-ninth Missouri Volunteers, is reported killed by Anderson at Centralia yesterday. The bushwhackers are increasing every hour. We must give them a severe blow without delay. Compel co-operation of citizens. I have requested General Rosecrans to send you 500 stand of arms and ammunition. Hot times are upon us.

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Colonel D. P. DYER,

Warrenton:

Push every man possible to Mexico. Organize the loyal citizens, with their private arms and horses, and set them at work. I have requested General Rosecrans to send you 500 extra stand of arms and ammunition therefor. Who will move the loyalists at Saint Charles?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Major F. D. EVANS,

Mexico:

Collect and give me all the facts touching the disaster to Major Johnston at Centralia yesterday. Do you hear from General Douglass, and in what direction are the guerrillas now in greatest force? Tell the politicians in convention at Mexico to-day that they had better shoulder their muskets and shotguns and help us to kill the bushwhackers instead of denouncing the Government and the military authorities.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Colonel DENNY,

Huntsville:

I cannot send other troops to Jacksonville, and see no good reason for holding that point. We cannot station troops at railway stations except where we have a telegraph office. Huntsville and Allen are the two points to guard in your country.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
