General R. E LEE:

General Baker reports a strong raid moving on Weldon railroad at Rocky Mount and continued preparations for the move on Goldsborough and this place. Little or no assistance can be had from the State Exemptions and reorganization under late law here disbanded the State force, and they will not be ready for some time. I go to Goldsborough to-night.
