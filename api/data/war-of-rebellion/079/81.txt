The enemy is reported 1,000 strong, nine miles north or Larkinsville. If true, they may have designs on some of our bridges. Keep a sharp lookout; make every preparation for them, and, if they come, whip them. Send notice to Company E at Pait Rock Station.

WM. P. LYON,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, October 4, 1864-11. 50 [a. m.].

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Pulaski:

General Washburn will have 3,000 cavalry this side of the Tennessee River to-day, and I have directed him to join you as soon as possible at Pulaski. With yours, his, and General Croxton's forces I want you to push Forrest to the death, holding your troops well in hand and snugly to the work. Forrest cannot cross the river now unless he has the crossing at Bainbridge moving upon that place yesterday. I learned from General Granter last night that Forrest's forces, threatening Huntsville, and retired toward Elk River, but the did not say whether he took the Elkton or Florence road. That simple omission has embarrassed me considerably, and I would like to have all reports made as definite and concise as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, October 4, 1864-3. 30 p. m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Columbia:

General Croxton suggest a good road for you to take by Mount Pleasant, as you find more forage on that road than is to be found on the old military road. I desire you to take the road referred to, it being by far the best.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

COLUMBIA, October 4, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Your dispatch, directing me to go by Mount Pleasant, just received. It has rained very hard to-day and the roads are very heavy and bad. Railroad between Columbia and Pulaski is not indjured, and but four or five miles between Columbia and Nashville destroyed.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
