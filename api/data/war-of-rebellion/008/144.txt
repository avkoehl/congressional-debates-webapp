NOTE.- Thirty-five of the above guns have been placed in position in batteries since March 1 by the Engineer Corps, including the Sappers and Miners. The three 8-inch columbiads in Battery Numbers 1 are guns I procured from the naval floating battery at Columbus, and mounted them as they now stand January 20 last, by order of Major-General Polk. The platforms had been built by me some six months previous, when I located and constructed the redan at Island Numbers 10. These three columbiads were the only guns fired by Captain Rucker during the engagement of March 17. The three smooth-bore 32-pounders were not fired. One other similar 8-inch columbiad I placed at the same time in Battery Numbers 5, where it now is. The floating battery New Orleans was placed on the north side of the island, to command the right channel of the river, which it effectually does. In all, at the present date, there are fifty -guns in position for the defense of Island Numbers 10.
