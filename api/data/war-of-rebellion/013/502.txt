nearly all the necessary operations were performed in the field infirmaries and the wounded rapidly conveyed to the general hospital. I cannot commend too highly the zeal and efficiency of the medical corps as a body in the performance of theirs arduous and responsible duties during the late bloody battles.

I also inclose an inventory* of captured medical and hospital supplies, which have been secured by Surg. James T. Johnson, medical purveyor. I regret to report to you that much hospital property has been secreted and retained without authority by medical officers, and even by officers of the line and private soldiers. To Surgeon Johnson is due great credit for the energy and efficiency he displayed in collecting and securing the captured hospital property we now hold in our possession. For further information in this particular I respectfully refer you to his inclosed report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. GUILD,

Surgeon and Medical Director, Army of Northern Virginia.
