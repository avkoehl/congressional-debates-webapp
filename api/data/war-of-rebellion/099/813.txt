DEAR COLONEL: Yours of this date with cipher dispatches of General Terry is just received by the officer and detachment sent by you. A tug-boat came up yesterday from Wilmington, and has returned. Another boat is here to go down to-night, and by her I send instructions to General Terry to send a boat with rations and forage for you, and to ferry you across to the east bank of Cape Fear, when I wish you to strike northeast for the railroad, and to join me somewhere about Faison's Station. Such orders should reach you by the 15th. I will move from here on that day-the 15th-for Goldsborough, striking the Wilmington roadd about Faison's, south of the Neuse River.

I am, truly, yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,
