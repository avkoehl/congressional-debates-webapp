Captain G. W. BOOTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Salisbury, N. C.:

CAPTAIN: Your telegram from Salisbury announcing that General B. T. Johnson has been assigned to command of the prisons in South Carolina has been received and answered by telegraph. I would desire to state that under the direction of the Secretary of War a prison is being constructed at Killian's Mills, eleven miles from here, on the Charlotte Railroad. The work is being urged forward as rapidly as possible, and the prison will be ready for the reception of over 15,000 prisoners in ten days.

I am endeavoring to remove the prisoners from Florence to this point, but cannot at present do so for want of troops to guard them in transitu. There are 7,000 enlisted men there under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Iverson, and nearly 1,200 officers here under command of Major E. Griswold. I am at present exercising command over both.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. FORNO,

Colonel, Commanding.
