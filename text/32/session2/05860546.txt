THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 8,
Nelson Barrere. No excuse offered.
James M. H. Beale.
Mr. AVERETT. My colleague [Mr. Beale]
has not been well for several days, and I move
that he be excused.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. FULLER, of Maine. Would it be in
order to move to adjourn?
The SPEAKER. It will be in order after the
doors are opened, so that members may get out.
[Laughter.]
William H. Bissell.
Mr. RICHARDSON. My colleague [Mr. Bis-
sell] has been detained from the House in con-
sequence of severe indisposition during the entire
session. I move that he be excused.
The motion was agreed to.
Thomas H. Bocock. No excuse offered.
Mr. DIMM1CK. Is it in order to move that
all further proceeding under the call be dispensed
with ?
The SPEAKER. It is in order.
Mr. DIMMICK. Then I submit that motion.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. Is that mo-
tion debatable?
The SPEAKER. It is not debatable. .
The question was then taken, and there were—
ayes 22, noes not counted.
So the House refused to suspend the call.
John H. Botd.
Mr. GOODENOW. Mr. Botd has been ab-
sent from his seat for several weeks. I move that
he be excused.
The motion was not agreed to.
John Bragg.
Mr. HOUSTON. Judge Bragg's health is
very delicate, and it is as much as he can do to re-
main in his seat during the session of the day.
Every gentleman knows it who sees him, and
therefore I move that he be excused.
The motion was agreed to.
John C. Breckinridge. No excuse offered.
George H. Brown. No excuse offered.
Lorenzo Burrows. No excuse offered.
Mr. GOODENOW. I move to reconsider the
yote by which the House refused to excuse Mr.
Appleton, of Massachusetts.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. I would in-
quire if that motion is debatable?
The SPEAKER. It is debatable to the extent
of making an excuse. That is all the rules recog-
nize.
Mr. STANTON. I wish to assume the privi-
lege of debating it to that extent. I think every
one is excusable for not being here to-night and
at any time during the session. The Speaker has
announced the principle that he has the right at
all times to recognize anybody he pleases.
Mr. ORR. I call the gentleman to order.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would like to
hear what the gentleman is about to say before he
is called to order.
Mr. SKELTON. I rise to a question of order.
Mr. ORR. It may be gratifying to the Chair,
but 1 do not think it proper under the circum-
stances.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands the
gentleman from Tennessee at least to indicate an
assault upon the Speaker, and the Chair thinks
that he ought to hear him.
[Cries of " Hear him !" " Hear him !"]
Mr. STANTON. I would like to say what I
have to say in order. I do not mean to say any-
thing out of order.
Mr. SWEETSER. I must call the gentleman
from Tennessee to order.
Mr. STANTON. If I am in order I desire to
proceed.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will hear some-
thing more in the line of remark which the gentle-
man from Tennessee desires to make.
Mr. STANTON. 1 have this to say 
Mr. STANLY. I object to the gentleman
going on with that line of remark, unless we have
a full hearing.
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not know
what the gentleman from Tennessee had in view.
Mr. STANLY. I object to anything further.
Mr. NABERS. I think it is due to the Speak-
ers? well as to the gentleman £rom Tennessee
himself, that he be allowed to proceed. If it be
in order, I move, by unanimous consent, that the
gentleman be allowed to proceed.
Mr. SWEETSER. My point of order is,
George T. Davis.
John L. Dawson.
David T. Disney.
Alfred Dockery.
Cyrcs L. Dunham.
Alfred P. Edgerton.
Henry A. Edmundson.
Presley Ewing. No excuse offered.

occasionally.

James M. Gaylord. No excuse offered.
Alfred Gilmore. No excuse offered.
John Z. Goodrich. No excuse offered.

John G. Floyd.
Mr. MURRAY. Mr. Floyd has an affection
of the knee, and is at home. I move that he be
excused.
The motion was not agreed to.
William T. Hamilton.
Mr. VENABLE. I move that Mr. Hamilton
be excused. His health is exceedingly delicate,
and he ought not to be here even in the daytime.
The motion was agreed to.
Edward Hammond.
BOWIE. Mr. Hammond has also been in
that the gentleman from Tennessee has already
indicated his purpose, and that purpose is an as-
sault upon the Speaker of this House. He says
that the Speaker has assumed the right to recog-
nize at his pleasure members from the State of !
Pennsylvania, and he has charged it upon him
that he has been guilty of a misapplication of the
rules, and that he has committed an outrage 
[Cries of " Order!" "Order!" "Order!"]
Mr. STANTON. I do not intend to say any-
thing disrespectful to the Speaker or this House.
1 mean to say this, the Speaker has announced
the p inciple that he has the right to recognize any-
body he pleases, whether he is the first to rise or
not; and I say the Speaker has acted upon the
principle he has announced 
Mr. PHELPS. I call the gentleman to order.
Mr. STANTON. I have had important busi-
ness of a public character upon which I have en-
deavored to get the floor on every Monday during
this session, when it ought to have been in my
power to move to suspend the rules; and I believe
upon many occasions 1 was entitled to the floor, [
but the Speaker has not recognized me. I
The SPEAKER. The Chair calls the gentle- !
man from Tennessee to order; and if the Chair
had a right to respond, he could give reasons why
the gentleman is something more than out of or-
der.
Mr. STANTON. Very well, sir 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is out of order,
and will take his seat.
The Clerk then proceeded with the call of the
roll.
Armistead Burt.
Mr. ORR. My colleague [Mr. Burt] has been
