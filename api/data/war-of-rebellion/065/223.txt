Forty shots fired during night; 9 missed. Three guns in Wagner, all firing to-day; also the 200-pounders at Gregg and middle battery. The 100-pounder at middle battery I have reason to believe was burst this morning.

Two hundred and thirty-four shots fired a fort to-day 32 missed. Most of their shells this afternoon were loaded with incendiary composition, which was has done no damage, however. The firing has been from both Gregg and Wagner, and chiefly from 8-inch rifles; very little assistance given us by Sullivan's Island; none by Fort Johnson.
