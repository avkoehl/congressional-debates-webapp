HEADQUARTERS EAST TENNESSEE BRIGADE,Camp Calvert, November 24, 1861.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding, &amp;c., Danville, Ky.

GENERAL: * * * We have arrivals every day from East Tennessee. The condition of affairs there is sad beyond description and if the loyal people who love and cling to the Government are not soon relieved they will be lost.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. CARTER,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, ADJT. General 'S OFFICE,Washington, D. C., November 25, 1861.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL,

Commanding Department of the Ohio.

GENERAL: * * * I am still convinced that political and strategical considerations render a prompt movement in force on Eastern Tennessee imperative. The object to ge gained is to cut the communication between the Mississippi Valley and Eastern Virginia; to protect our Union friends in Tennessee and re-establish the Government of the Union in the eastern portion of that State. Of course Louisville must be defended but I think you will be able to do that while you move into Eastern Tennessee. If there are cuases which render this course impossible we must submit to the necessity but I still feel sure that a movement on Knoxville is absolutely necessary if it is possible to effect it. Please write to me very fully.

Very truly, yours,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EAST TENNESSEE BRIGADE,Campt Calvert, November 25, 1861.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS, U. S. Army,

Commanding, &c., Danville, Ky.

GENERAL: * * * The rebel force at Cumberland Gap is from the best information I can obtain so small that I think we will meet with but little opposition in case it is determined to advance by that pass. Our desires are to get to East Tennessee as soon as possible in order that our loyal friends there may be relieved. Many of them have been lying out in the woods to escapte their enemies but as the season advances they will be driven to their houses and be forced into the rebel ranks or carried to prison. Let us up and help them now when it will require so little to accomplish this desirable and necessary end.

I am, general, respectfully and truly, yours,

S. P. CARTER,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding.
