THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

No"/, Mr. President, I have hut a few words
to a<\y in reply to the Shmnloi ftom
Tie the* i arrr^nrd the P". id<n:, ri ray
tpet::h other day, for l'<<- ve> y elf- o-- < f which
I was guilty two y<\>i j sine:1, in mf very debute
of two years a;io, which \% no Ar befcv mc, ami
from which he Las taken the garbled extract, I
arraigned the policy ofcond uctin^ our armies then
in severer language than I did in my recent speech.
It was when the confiscation law was threatened
with defeat by a veto, when our armies were used
to return slaves to rebel masters. I find in the
debate now lying before me the very sam° con-
demnation of<£ conservatism" that 1 medein my
recent spot ch. But the Senator says I h 3 vc-changed
my mind in regard to emancipating slaves for
military service. Why,sir, I said on that point,
in the very debate from which he read, what I
will now tend, and I would test ray position even
by the advanced opinion of the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Sumker.]
Mr. WILKINSON. TheSenatorismistaken;
I did not say so.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senator does not know
what he says when he gets excited. This is what
I said on that point:
u Ilnw <: r emancipation should hp extended to those
slave5 who sender I'.iuhtul seme" to thecoumrv is a more
difficult question—but upon a few propoMtjnn^ we oei-
tatriSy can ;i ico. Who would fiirrender to hi- ici « 1 mas-
ter I ho lit-roic *iuve pilot who. hv iuy eoun.-ie .mil -:iii<icity,
added a ve> to om >\.uy? Who vi ould ^ui rend. i to a
ri'bel mih-ti-r the -l.ive \\ lio. amid hc;it and -foi ta and liat-
t!e, led .in.I e.ticfi tor and wailed on our oiri^^r^ pud *o!-
diei-s? Who would give up to petpetu.il shivery the very
many n<'^ine>, who,dmnm the war, have ri-Ked their uvea
10 eunvey a- luipoitant intelligence? 5u, whaie\er vd«f;i-
rie-, and p!e)udi''t- may cling to n^. I tiu-t no one anionrr
us would con-cut to rewaid th^servee^ ofloyal slave* l>y
perpetual and hopeless bondage to refK' ma-ters. Sucli a
policy would h ; i«u* irwro iiU«\raou  than tin ieb« I lion U-e! i.
Without t'urtuer defining my vi<>\v< upon tins >uhjeet at tins
time, F am willing to olfiini torni) sell that nevei will 1 con-
sent to fUiremler a Mave wlio has tendered any service,
however menial, to our Army to the custody of a ithel mai-
ler; nor will I deprive a lo> <it ma-tei ol'In- intere.-t in the
^eiviee.s of hi-? ,slave without mil compensation.*'—Cun-
gre\<tioru<l Glul/e^ Thutij-Seicnth Co/i^jcsaj z>enjntl iCiSum,

And I now affirm that the only difference be-
tween the Senator from Minnesota and myself io
this whole matter is this: that he would rob the
loyal master of what by the local law is properly
with.nit compensation, in violation of an express
provision of the Constitution, while I would u -t.
That is just the dsiference between us, the length
and the breadth of it, and the whole debate shows
it. The debate between the Senator from Kansas
and mvself shows that 1 would have exumdid
cm«.ncipatioo to all those shtv< s actually • mployed
io tb" mill!,!!1'' Vice 5:! lilir Army, but beCnut-1 u
n< i^ro in K'-.rueky *vas omp!<>y< d to carry an "s-
sa^e or v. is hired fo drive a t^• nii:, I would not
exit ml the provision for compiusatiou '■  [lis
ca^e. In that debate I said fhat w!k ue •/> r a no-
gro, whether slave or fi ee, wore the uinl'm. n"of
the Army of the United St \U s ami s. i **i d in our
ranks, I iiev* r would mart rib r hon to eitin r a
loyal or rebel master, but that J would m t ex-
tend emancipation further than the law a of war
justified, nod I wouUl not rob a !o val ma a of w!tc t
by his local law is property wUhout giving h;m
just compensation; n<*r would 1 iii iLc.m 'mm:-, of
trouble, whop we want all the money ihar ue eat)
hu::banu' and gather, extend this enumeration t«>
every tj.t\e simply because he wes emp'-'Vid m
casut-1 service not necessarily connected with the
Army, and omy for tlie time heino1, and to
vivo "for him compensation out ot the Treasury of
the Uaiu d Sietes.
Now, Mr. Piesident, I have answered these
two i!,dr.ts. I have shown that J have j-a-d muse
a'jcu s'-t t'lie policy tin n ^oio^ on, by which oiu*

will give him the praise due to his position. I
leave that point, however, to those who have
seen our mutual efforts to advance the cause of
our country; not to him,
I say ag-ain, in conclusion, this attack, made in
my abscnee, not simply upon me but upon all the
Senatois who agreed with n\e on those questions
gf constitutional law, wis unjustifiable and un-
patriotic, tending to divide and distract those who
must stand to^efher shoulder to shoulder, and it
ought to be and f bebc-ve has be>m lebuked.
3Mr, WILKINSON. The Senator insists that
he holds the same view he did before 
Mr. SHERMAN, if the Senator will allow
me before he proceeds, 1 wish to say a word fur-
ther. The Senator referred to the Senator from
Kansas, [Mr. Pomeuoy.] He is here to speak
for himself. The Senator from Kansas is one of
those radical men who voted with him. He is
not one of those 44 timid men" who put consti-
tutional blocks .in the way. The Senator from
Minnesota says, or seems to intimate by insinu-
ation, that I am a member of the committee of
which the Senator fr  m Kansas is chairman.
Why did he not hav - the manliness, since he talks
about *' manliness," to j>o mid ask the Senator or
me was that 11 ue oj not?
Mr. WILKINSON. I said no such thing,
made no such intonation.
Mr 311ERM \N. The Senator did say that
he behoved I was eomvc.tid with the committee,
or suim'thiujr of that kind.
Mr. WiLKJNSON. I did not say any such
thing.
Mr. SEIEPcMAN. I simply wanted to make
thisstatement in correction, lfthe Senator wanted
any information on that subject he could have
go! it either from t he Senator trom Kansas or me,
by an emphatic denial.
Mr. WILKINSON. I did not say any such
th:n<>. I said that 1! was well understood here and
thi oui(h<mt tin count t y that ih< re was a coiimut-
teo oi^anized, of which the honorable Senator
f oni Kansas [Mi. Po.v;i ROy] w.«s < hairman, the
purpose of which was to (h uat Mr. Lincoln for
;he nomin.uion for the neX' Piesidency. I did not
know ol* whom th" common e is composed exreot !(

gerous, and which wfli add veiy much to our already ac-
cumulati d (Ufficulties."
I assumed from this, in connection with the
other extracts which I read and which were pub-
lished in my speech, that the honorable Senator
was not m favor of paying for the slaves of loyal
masters; but while they would be received in our
service, he was for returning them back again to
slavery and paying the masters their wages, be-
cause lie .said so in direct terms.
the death op slavery is the life op the
nation.
Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, "our coun-
try," said that illustrious statesman, John Q,oincy
Adams, " be^-an its existence by the umvtr&al
emancipation of man from the thralldom of man."
Amidst the darkling storms of revolution it pro-
claimed as its living faith the sublime creed of
human equably. From out the roiling clouds of
battle the new Republic, as it took its position in
the family of mo ions, proclaimed in the<ar of all
hnmanity that the poor, the humelo, the sons of
toil, who,hands wer< hardened by honest !abor}
whose limbs wvr" chilled bv the blasts of winter,
whose cheeks wt re scorched by ihe sons of sum-
mer, wen- the peers, the equ.d., before the law,
of kimrs and princes and nobles, of ihe mob-t fa-
vored of the sons of men. When its splendid
edifice of constitutional government rose in grand-
eur and beauty upon the vision of mankind the
champions of popular rights in the Old World,
and the people, in whose heatts still lingered, the
dimly-itmemhered acc< nts of hb<-ity, as they
turned their gaze hithei ward, hailed and wel-
comed thy advent of the new-born lit public. In
after years, amid the throes of rewshuiont, they
turned ever to the nsmg Republic beyond the
s'-as for the inspiration of fnith and hope in the
final tiiumph of s-ruu^lin^ humanity. And the
tepublics of the New World, as they emerged
from colonial dependence, through the fire and
blood of evolutions, to narional life, turmd to-
wai d uruled A merica as the ^qeat exoniphtr whose
steady lights would lilumo their daikftied path-
way to uati< nel uiis'y and power,and liberty reg-
ulao d by law.
