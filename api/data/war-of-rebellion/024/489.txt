GENERAL: We have pursued the enemy 4 miles below this city, killing and capturing. I have taken prisoner a captain and commissary of subsistence on Van Dorn's staff. He says Van Dorn is not in arrest. I find a hospital 1 1/2 miles from town with a number of convalescents. In all I have about 100 prisoners, and the work is going on.

Very respectfully,

GENERAL: I have been skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry all day.

They have and up five regiments. We have just ended an affair in some force, and they are now advancing on us openly with artillery. General Sullivan is here, but thinks he may have exceeded orders, and feels delicate about engaging in any fight now to hold this place. If you will allow me to express my opinion, we should be immediately re-enforced or not expected to hold the place. I believe their infantry is mainly, if not quite, the other side of Tallahatchie, some may be this side. I have been nearly to Lumpkin's Mill, and their strong force of cavalry followed me back. Have captured a lieutenant and several men. Please send instructions to me immediately and to the infantry behind me. General Sullivan decides to fall back to Coldwater, fearing an engagement. I continue to occupy the place, and shall do so until further orders.

A. L. LEE,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Division.

GENERAL: An officer I sent this afternoon to examine the railroad bridges over Coldwater has already reported to General Quinby that the two bridges were sound and the rails in order. He rode over the two bridges on a hand-car and went within 2 miles of Lamar. From what my men have seen and the statement of the laborers on the road.
