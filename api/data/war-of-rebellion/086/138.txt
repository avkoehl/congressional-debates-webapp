me. They acknowledge that I am too well prepared for cavalry, and are only waiting for their artillery and a part of the men whose forces left this section in 1861 and have been out ever since. If we get artillery, we will ship them; if not, we will do the best we can.

Captain FRANK ENO,

I have a report of a force of 150 men at Martinsburg. They burned the water-tank there. No artillery reported. Have sent a scout out west from there.

MEXICO, October 20, 1864-5.12 p. m.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

I have not heard of large bodies of rebels on the North Missouri Railroad, and do not believe they have artillery. Numerous small bands are all over the country destroying property and robbing citizens.

Brigadier-General.

MEXICO, MO., October 20, 1864.

Lieutenant HANNAHS:

I propose to move to-morrow night from Renick to Fayette with 700 infantry and 3,000 cavalry of Colonel Forbes, and thence operate eastward. Is there any objection to this, on account of things south of the river or at Glasgow?

Colonel Fortieth Missouri Infantry.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 20, 1864.

Colonel SAMUEL A. HOLMES,

Mexico, Mo.:

You will send at once to Perruque bridge 300 men, being about what will be left of the troops I sent up the road, after you take out the 700 for your expedition to Fayette. Send them under an excellent officer, with orders to stand fast under all circumstances. Answer, saying when the men will be sent. Your dispatch reads that you will take 3,000 cavalry. I suppose it should read 300. I think well of the expedition to Fayette if there is an enemy there. Have telegraphed to General Rosecrans and suppose he will approve. Go unless you hear further.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
