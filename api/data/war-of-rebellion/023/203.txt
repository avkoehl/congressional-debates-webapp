Colonel J. B. FRY:

Have telegraphed to the powers at Corinth asking if rations can be sent to Decatur for us; will report answer. General Thomas has not transportation under his command to do so, and the heavy locomotive cannot cross Bear Creek Bridge; it is too weak. Lady Jackson off the rocks and gone down the river.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

General Halleck's chief commissary telegraphs me to that he cannot send a pound, as his troops are living from hand to month. The reason is limited means of transportation. This would prevent us from using Eastport as a base also. I will return to-morrow.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have the honor to report that I have just now been informed by Mr. Douglas, a respectable and reliable citizen of this neighborhood, that there is a force of 4,000 rebels with artillery on the south bank of the Tennessee River in the vicinity of Gunter's Ferry and Ford, and their intention is to take possession of and destroy the railroad east of Huntsville. He believes they will cross the river this day for that purpose. I am informed by Major McMynn, Tenth Wisconsin Infantry, that Mr. Douglas is a person in whose word confidence can be placed.

Very respectfully, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
