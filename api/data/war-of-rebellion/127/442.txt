their claim to lands in the Territory of Florida, and for all improvements on the lands so ceded, the sum of $15,400, to be divided among the chiefs and warriors of the several towns in a ration proportioned to their population; and they further agreed to take the cattle belonging to the Seminoles at the valuation of some person to be appointed by the President, and to pay the valuation in money to the respective owners or give them other cattle; and the expenses of removal were to be paid by the United States and subsistence for twelve months to all emigrants furnished by them;

And that no compensation has ever been made any of the said Apalachicola band for the lands or improvements so abandoned by them, or for the horses, mules, cattle, and other property abandoned by them; nor have they ever received any part of the annuities paid the Seminole or Creek Nation since their removal west, or been recognized as an integral part of the Seminole Nation, as it was provided they should be;

And inasmuch as the forced emigration of the said band, and their surrender and abandonment of their lands, improvements, horses, cattle, and other property in consequence thereof, was equivalent, as against the United States, to an election by them to surrender the rights and privileges secured by the treaties of the eighteenth of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, and to claim the rights and privileges thereby vesting in them, as parties to the treaty of Payne's Landing, of the ninth of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two:

Therefore, it is hereby agreed by the Confederate States of America, by Albert Pike, its commissioner with full powers, with the members and survivors of the Apalachicola band of Florida Indians, that upon and after the restoration of peace the said claims of the members of that band to compensation for the loss of the lands, improvements, horses, cattle, mules, and other property shall be fairly investigated, in a generous and liberal spirit, by an officer or commissioners, to whom that duty shall be assigned by the Confederate States; and that whatever shall appear upon such investigation to be justly or equitably owing to members of the said band on account of such losses as aforesaid shall be paid to the persons originally entitled to the same, or to the legal representatives of such of them as may be deceased.

And it is also further agreed that the foregoing provisions of this article shall extend to and include the claims for losses of the same kind by members of Black Dirt's band of friendly Seminoles, who lost property in like manner in consequence of their hurried removal west, as the same is contained in the schedule thereof, marked B,* annexed to this article.

And it is also agreed that the claims to money, in lieu of bounty-land warrants, of the persons whose names and those of their heirs are contained in the schedule marked C,* annexed to this article, shall, in like manner and at the same period, be investigated, and so far as they shall be found to be well founded shall be paid by the Confederate States.

In perpetual testimony whereof the said Albert Pike, commissioner with full powers of the Confederate States of America, doth hereunto set his hand and affix the seal of his arms.
