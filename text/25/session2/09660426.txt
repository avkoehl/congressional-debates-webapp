member would n.vet on the Government, and pro-
long such a state of things
The member has spoken of the neglect, by the
Government, of the industry of the countiy, mean-
ing, I présame, those in the employ of his favorite
baúles—broker , stockjobbeis, constables, sheriffs,
&c He knows well that it is for the protection oí
the industry and labor of the country that every
energy of the Government has been put forth, for
which n n?s been so virulently denounced bythose
who neith-i live by labor nor industry He, then,
is at fault igain m this respect, and must try ano-
ther gtiü imp to catch Innocence and ignorance
He said the surplus ol co'ton, lie expected, w ould
be thrown o\eiboard and burnt by the Secretary,
idtner th?p have it paid ''or in any thing other than
gold and silver Does the gentleman senously
think so? or « as tins one of h s hy perboles' or did
he nt nd it as grave argument for this dehoeialive
bod}? llevidently sho>(s the means which men in
high places may be induced to emp'.oj under des-
psrate Circumstances, when moie laudable and ho-
i i rah'e ones are not exactly at hand
The member has sa d, many had rode into office
upoi the war horse oF anti-binkism, and denounc
ing corporations, but he did not tell us how many
lode into ofhee on the shoulders of the banks, nor
what facilities were used to get members here, nor
how many it held b/ the hand after getting them
here
Bt t the hono able membei is again contradicted,
f om an unfoituna e quarter for him He has said
inat the B nkoi the United States was unpopular,
ana ipo.i its unpopulamy many nde m'o oflre
Here, «gam, is a different language, held at the
same time, by brethren of the same church, blowing
hot mid cold to suit the appetites of those whom they
would use The honoiable member from Rhode
Island [Mr Tiui\ghast] has just told us thit the
Bank ot the United States was a popular institution,
that it had ever been wnh the people, and that he
had boldly met the question before them, and had
put his offp nienis to the rout upon that subject
Now, without deciding which of the honorable
members of the ciaft is m the right, I shall leave
then consistency and political sincerity and accu-
rary to be judged of by others They are of the
sane chnich, bat dvocate veiy diffuent doctrines

the honorable Representative ol the palace in
Chestnut s'ie t \t ore moment playing the lugh-
pneU and expounder of constitutional law, stnctiy,
as spoken and deli/e^ed by the oracles of the tem-
pie, and the nut moment swelling his voice, and
trying aloud—'he people—the people—their voice
should be beard, with an appeal to the worst and
lowest oi pass t,ns law, Constitution, ancient m-
s ltutuns and all, all are to be disregarded when
the people speak Sir, aie not such human mcon-
sistenc es omnons oí something more monstrous'
No, sit it i ti e wontee1 means by which the craft
lias ever «on rd their way into poner, and letam-
ed in ill gotten ascendancy over the sturdy sons
of labor and toil
Ine gentleman's repugnance to tne sight of gold
and siner, feives him the hydrophobia The «hole
id a of such a currency is ridiculed and denounced
by h in is imp-av-ticabie, and a udiculous expen-
ment, notwn islanding the evidence of all ancient
and modern htsloiy to the contrary The same
paity denouiiceu in t te same way, the whole theory
ol this iree Democratic Republican form of Go
vernment in its origin undci which we now live,
as an impracticable and dangerous experiment, be-
cause the enlightened jnmcipte of freedom, justice,
and eqjali'y, upon which it is founded, were sub-
versive and des ructixe to tne gnniiiiig and erloi-
lionate runciplcs ot aristocracy, by which their
hiera ch ml cnrts can alone be sus'ained They
foresaw this m the origin of oi r free Government,
and tney foresee now the enlightened principles
that aie, eie long, to sap the very loundations of
their jstem o. ot tl ciaft and extortions, to sustain
which member of the '■ame family, advocates of
the same abomina! ons, are driven to advocate
different principles and hold different language at
the ¿ame and diffeient times    Such are the politi-
cal effects of a dilemma so torturing and inextrica-
ble
But I do not propose to dwell much longer upon
the remarks of the memher from Philadelphia I
think I have already shown a sufficient "leaven to
leaven the whole."
The honorable member, however, has informed
us that Treasury notes were money, because, says
he, you can pay your debts with them, and he was
opposad to them for that reason. Now what do
the people pay their debts at this time in, if not in
bank noies of different kinds' What did they pay
their debts in before the Revolution' Do we not
then know that tobacco, and other articles, were
made receivable for debts in many of the States,
and particulaily in Virginia' Let him ask the
honorable gentleman on his left [Mr James Gar-
land ]
Vanous articles at different times, in different
state , as well as nations, have been taken in li-
quidation of debis, yet, none ever thought of their
buing considered money Such an objection is too
shallow for senous argument. The gentleman
seems disposed to think that nothing should be
taken in payment of debts, but United States Bank
notes, and whether money or rags, dependa upon
the nod of one man He als-o brought up
the old bugbear, which was used with but
little effect at the last session by any hon-
orable Senator [Mr Webster] from Massa-
chusetts, of continental money, and declared in
the true oracular language, that Treasury notes
would be in a short time what Continental money
was, they had as well told us that every other
bank note would in time have been the same, for
there was just as much resemblance in the one as
the other The same objections were made to the
issue of Treasury notes, by the same party, under
another name, during or immediately after the last
war, and the same identical piedictions made,
and with what truth the history of the Govern-
mentshows Such arguments are mere bugbears
and bugaboos, intended solely for panics, but
which should alarm only children under their teens
Such, sir, is me character of the most of the argu-
ments used by the honorable member from Penn-
sylvania [Mr Serci am] and in his minority re-
port is the most feedle atten'pt lo sustain h s cor-
rupt and rotten institutions by catchwords, sophis-
tic arguments, and demogogueism that I have ever
w itnessed in this oi any other deliberative body,
and I hazard nothing in asserting it, that the in-
telligent practical people will decide it so upona
candid impartial view of them, and here will take
leave of the honorable member and his remarks on
this subject
I will now «ay a word or two to a few ob-
servations that fell from the gentleman from Rhode
Island, [Mi Tillinghast ] This gentleman has
enlisted as one of the new macks and prophets
oí the craft Th s gentleman, in doleful sounds
and lugubrious vaticinations, tells us that all is
wrong, and all must end in wreck and ruin, unless
the Government will listen to the melody of his
voice The House is wrong, the committee are
wrong, they have not given the bill the right name,
it is intended for another purpose than that for
which it purports to be Now will the gentleman
be so kind as to christen it properly, as it may
belong more particularly to those from the high
temple to do such things, which may be, however
properly, unecciesiastically done by others, who
may not have been vested w ith those high func
lions This gentleman, too, leaving the subject,
seems to have thought of little else than the United
States Bank and its interest Poor people1 little
does the honoiable member seem to have thought
of th"m or their interest, and scarcely gives them a
passing notice, so eager is he m defence of the
gieat Bank He too has renewed the old cry of
" war against the banks " I had thought that thi-c
had become too stale longer to answer the purpose
of deception, even If it is intended for home con-
sumption, let me tell the gentleman that the people
whom he represents must be much behind the
times, and weighed down by superstition and impo-
sitions of the craft, for it to have much effect with
them What, s r' War against the banks' how
absurd' how ridiculous' how insulting to the in-
jured people of this nation' What war? For the
Government to beg to be separated from the banks,
and to tie let alone by them? Is this your war?
Has not the Government done every thing in its
power to accommodate and appease them? Is it
not at this very time doing it'
Or, is it war against the banks for the Govern-
ment to resolve no longer to be preyed upon at the
mercy of these Shylock institutions? Is it war
against the banks for Government to endeavor to
stay their grinding extortions and exactions from
the industry and labor of the country' Is this bill
a part of that war now, which is to wait with them
and to indulge them, to enable them with conve-
nience to pay what they justly owe to this Govern-
ment, and wrongfully detain from its use' What
shameful ingratitude towards the most indulgent of
Governments' How audacious and insulting to
the people, whom they have robbed and put at
defiance'
Sir in human impudence and arrogance they
stand without a parallel It there is a war, it is
emphatically a war of the banks against the Go-
vernment and the labor and industry of the coun-
try, which has been earned on for years in dis-
guise. It is an effort on the part of the banks to
subj ugale this proud and once freest Government
on earth, and make it nod in servile submission to
the mercenary will and interest of a single pam-
pered and arrogant institution, which has entered
and besieged your verv Capitol, and made battle
with you for the power of the Government on
both floors of your Congress.
The gentleman has spoken of the dangers of
popular commotion Well may he and his clique
have an eye to that. The proud spirit of indepen-
dence and generous iove for freedom is- not yet
subdued in all sections of this country, nor is it in
the power of priestcraft, kingcraft, or bankcraft, to
place this yoke of ignominy and corruption around
their necks, without exciting popular indignation
as well as commotion, pregnant with revenge, it
not with death
Sir, let me tell him the people have been tam-
pered with already too much by these hypocritical,
cunning, crafty, institutions. Much have they
borne of long suffering and patience They have
not only been supporting with food and raiment
your unproductive drones jn society, but have been
turned on by them, and insulted as ignoble, vgnaiant
herds, that should be driven ft om your Capitol and
the high places ihey dishonor
Gentlemen should not presume too much upon
the ox-like forbearance of a high spirited noble
minded people, and let me invoke them not to op-
press them too far, nor to rely too much upon their
systems of cunning and craft, to keep up the de-
lusion, and to hold them m bondage
Mr Speaker, I will now notice some of the re-
marks of the amiable, modest, and forbearing gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania, who sets nearest to me
on my left [Mr Biddle,] whose mild and amiable
disposition never permits him <o speak of one
that he hates, "unkind things "
He too has had but little to say on the subject
of the bill before the House, but has launched off
into a discursive electioneering harangue intended,
no doubt, to operate on the good people of Penn-
sylvania He has performed but the usual duties
of his since, and anathematized, and piepared, no
doubt, as he thought the Secretary of your Treasury
for the guillotine,ofpopularindignation. Heinforms
us that the Secretary, with others of his pari v, must
go dow n to posterity, as the most miserable and
wicked mercenaries, and entertained us with an
amusing dialogue between the Secretary and the
laborers m the service of the Government The
fiction has been drawn with great exactness, to suit
the taste of those reckless squads of idlers, who
would delight most m the reality of the scene, and
give pleasure alone to those bank myrmidons, who
rejoice at such a state of things; and none, sir, none
more than the particulars and intimates of the
honorable member, whose tastes he so well under-
stands, and seems so carefully to have consulted m
the pictures he has drawn to fancy.
The starving laborer, he tells us, goes to Mr.
Woodbury, and demands his pay, and receives for
answer that he has no monej—the Gowenunent is
