RICHMOND, VA., February 22, 1865.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Chester, S. C.:

Your telegram of yesterday received, and a copy of it sent to General Lee. Your request for large re-enforcements from the Army of Virginia will best be judted of General Lee. I am sorry to see that youdo not expect a junction to be made by Stewart and Cheatham in time for the pressing emergency. I had hoped that by moving on the left of the enemy, if he were obstructed in his advance, they would reach you before any junction could be made by Sherman with Shchofield or Grant. The position of the enemy near Wilmington endangers the continued use of the railroads on the east of your line of retreat.

JEFF'N DAVIS.
