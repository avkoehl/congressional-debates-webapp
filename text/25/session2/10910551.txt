Duel Reports—Mr. Foster.
W pfReps*
no cou .tenance bhould be given, by refusal oi delay, to an im
pressi mi that in this particular matter, the mehibers of this
Hoube would notbe as willing, or did not fiud themselves as
cornet, ent, as m any other to provide for an ín&íjlíy mto the
citcunmtances, with a new ultimately to decide wifot might be
due to tu moral sense of the nation, as well asJib their own
dignity and regard foi the laws I am satisfied wfth the votes
Ithenga\e, and should give the same again under the same
eircumatances I may, thereiore, feel relieved fiom embaí
rassmentani from liability to misconstiuction In taking the
only course winch, m the presert posture of this proceeding, I
find inybeif permitted to take Feeling that thereslsons for this
course are ímpeíativt and extremely clear, I desire that they
should be distinctly and clearly understood by others
Ihe decision upon the question now laised will form a signal
piecedent in all futuie proceedings of a similar character It
la, therefore, important that the precise nature and extent of
thisquestion, and of the reasons which constrain the votes of
members upon it, should be carefully made known I trust
ttils will be done
When the lamented and most melancholy event which has
•xcited so keen an mterestshall have been presented to us up
on us naked and unqualified facts, (as I believe was the znten
tion of the House) and presented accoidmg to those laws of
proceeding m such cases which are as binding upon us as any
const1 tutiunal principle or law undei which we act in any case,
we «shall be in a situation to do our whole duty to the subject,
and I indulge the behefthat, whatever that duty may appe.u
to be, we are piepaied to do it to the full extent of our obliga
tions      We shall meet the occasion and the cal, whatevei it
may be, with firmness with dignity, and with a proptu íegard
fot those high and paiamount principles to which civil society
owes its existe¡ ce and its security      In such cases, we are em
pTiatually lemmded that the legislator should distinguish be
tween hi  iegislattveandhismdividual capacity    1 allow my
selftsfeel peisuaded thateveiy membei of thisXIouseis able
ánd wilhngeo to distinguí h, that each will forget himself as a
person, aad remember himself only as a legislator, charged
with the welfaie of the whole peop e, exercising his high im
perse ml functions under the most solemn and immediate re
sp msibihty to the Supreme Fountain of all law, and right, and
powei,as well as to that community whose pieseut agent he is,
and that ptrnemy who will feeland judge his acts     We have
been told, more than o ice, that we may, in our own ptusons,
become the suujects or the victims ol  the decisions we may
make in this ca&e      ¡Sir, this is true, and this is also right
El^eiy legislator is bound to devote, and mint, ei necessity, de
voté him "'fto this hazaid      The infirmities of winch all and
etch muct be conscious, may, in tne unfoiesecn course of

So much I have deemed itne^e&sary to say in reference to the
su gesiu n t tat the investigation ought not to be suppresse 1 I
do not pf-iceive what argument upon the present question is
contained m that suggestion I am, as I was fiom the begin
mng, in favor of the investigation To all that is proper to bf
done for icpdt ring it thorough and completelam ready to con
tribute my °hare But I am also in favor of the Constitution
and the laws The investigation ceitamly can be, and certain
ly should be, conducted accoiding to thelaws and rules of pro
ceedmg established foi cases of investigation, and whatever, in
such ca<-e, the House íefers to a committee, whether resolu
tton oi trtmoiial,isrefeired to be dealt with according U> and
unn>i taooc taws and i ule
Sir I ca mot persuade myself that the point now raised fo
our con&ideiation is light mdUmal It is said that uis a mere
question of ioim But, when that is said, nothing is said which
neceseaniy determines it to be of Utile importance I can see
that, so lai as it is matter of foi m, it is of a form that might have
been and may be easily complied with But that ignota leason
foi ovei lot ling or overleaping ir It certainly struck me, at
the commencement, as heme a question re pec nis form But
it must be lemembered that, m proceedings of which ticie
suit may h" penalty forms aie substance and, the mote high
and stiioi <* the subject mattprof the mquir> the more material
and subs antial lb the form E\eiy civilized country, ut which
the principles of civil libetty are regaided, recognises the nc
cessity of forms and fixed ru'es of procet ding in such case",
wmch, when established and while m force, shall be inviolable
Fir th«> p irpose of meeting the aigumeot, then, upon the
grojnd assumed by it, let thi  be thoughtof andrcllectel upon
as a question of form Tustice ana piopnety rt quire that we
shtu'd decide it separately and distinctly by itself, %vi hout being
influenced by any impressions whatever upon the propriety of
thd investigation oi upon the sulsjeet mattei to be investigated
Whatevei, if any, opinion I may have on that subject matter, it
isnotneces aiy, uoi would it be i roper, that I should letei to it,
dis^u <* it, or all >w my judgment t be in the slightest degree af
fected by it, m settling this question which involves solely the
method ofpioctcding in oil such cases, and not the meuts oi
dcn>uts orihis part culai ctse
I do not a'iow mvseli to suppose that this House m deciding
upon the existence ci a pliuibihty of a form or rule of pioceed
in?, will be influenced by opinions upon the merits of the matter
involved n the proceeding Yet the difficulty of avor ling- such
an influence is the °aeat danger to which forms and rules, esta
b ished foi the protection of the most important rights, are not
unfiequently exposed In many cases it happen* that men
know, or believe they know, m anticipation, ají the material
(acts they have an opunon or a feeling in regard to them which
they conscientiously, and, it may be supposed, jitotly believe to
Jb^rrghtj^nd. thus behermg* thele is danger ¿hat they will look
wan ijnfríénMly eyeuponVftát seem, is the* particular case,
t6 oenterely tedious arfa fastidious fbtms, and regard them as
■ubélavíeisTri th  way^ of tufth %hd Justice, iftfrf posed by cau-
tiousness, or tending only to delay But to dispense with a rule
upon such grounds, is to ovei throw at once all rules and all the
reasonson wh ch they are founded The rule of one case must
be the ruleot all cases of the same soil, otherwise, theie is, in
truth, no rule fot any case Ereiy case would be subject to the
arbitrary discietion of the tribunal, which would decid* in each
whether it was oi was not, upon us particular merits, a case for
dispensing with the iu!e Thus, as the rule could always be
dispensed with, each individual case would be subjected to a
mode of trial peculiar to itself It is not sufficient to say that
there may be cases m tfhich there may be a captious use, or an
abuse of the rule The power which piovides the rule consi
dpjs, at the proper time, the possibility of abuse as well as the
use It weighs the one against the other Fmding the use, the
utility, and necessity to preponderate, probably with immense
dispioportion, it establishes the rule When established, it is
the law of the land It must be obseived and administered by
the tribunal, even where the party is ignorant of its existence, or
docs not expressly claim it taeuerally, (as in forms of proceed
ing befoie arraignment,) it is not at his option to waive it It is
not merely the right of the man who is to be ti led, it ^ the right
of the community, the right ot all men whoaienot on trial, that
the fixed and established rules of proceeding should be ob
served
If, before my eyes, one man slays another—I see and know
the fact and all its cucurnstanc s—can I execute upon him the
las t sentence of the law? Can I call on twelve by standeis,
equally Witnesses of the fact, to proceed and try him? Can a
court then in session, being witnesses also of the fact commuted
in their prest-nce, put him at once upon trial before the i ury m
the box? If he consents to this node of trial and form of pro
ceeding, can it be done? What prevent^ The rules and forms
of proceeding established for scch cases, and in existence at
the time of the offence commute 1 The laws prescribe the
same inflexible forms of pioeeeding, whether the fact be fla
grant oi doubtful, tney require i foim ol presentment upon a
procese, strictly according to form, by a grandjur>, and, in
coastituung that grand jury, as well as in their proceedings, ¿nd
in all subsequent proceedings, every prescubed form must be
complied with, howevei unimportant it m ty, at tin, moment,
sepm Even if the lacking half hour of time elap°ed at mid-
night, when he was asleep, and could make no use of it, it may
yet avoid (he whole proceeding It is not left to the tribunal to
say how much may be dispensed with and how much re
t dined
In regard to \ules regulating proceedings upon inquiries in
stituted by tins House, the ngnt to the rule i1; not the individual
right, oi privilege of the member as an indiv dual It is the
right of his consumen s It is the right oí the constituents of
a1! the memo* is, of my const tuents, su, and of yoms Hy the
Constitution, the House is to establish i ules for its proceed
logs Wh«n established, and while in force, the) aie constitu
tunal law
I can only regiet as unfortunate that the comm up© it thfii
first meeting, did not loo* into th* tpnt of the Mai ml, and es
pecially nuo that chaptei upon proceedings in con mitteee,
which contains the rule now in question, with a view to apply
mgitto the proceedings they were about to commf nee and thus
recognise and theieupon take the plain couisewh eh it seems to
me lay befoie them They would then, probab y, after their
first sitting aftei the examination of the first witnesses, or at
such other time in the session as they deemed expedient, have
repoited a state oí facts embraced m the rule, a&asceitamed
upon sworn evidence, which would have placed the House, for
the fust time, officnlly and constitutionally in possession of
matter upon which all subsequent proceedings must be founded
The House would then, piobably, without delay, either have
come to a resolution to proceed here or else would have given
at once to the committee the specie authority stated in the
rule Very piobably the latter would have been the course, as
more convenient to the parties and to the House
But flus has not been done The rulo has been overlooked or
disregarded I think it an om ssion In this Mate of things,
the responsibility is uiged upon the House to declare that the
rule does not exist, or that it is not applicable
If it casts as a rule of the House, there can he no question
that it is applicable I applies, by its terms, to all cased of in
quines before committees
It maid that it is to be found only in Jefferson's Manual—
not in the numbered rules This may be the itahon that it wis
overlooked in the committee, but it is no reason that we ehnnl 1
disregard it now that it is pressed upon our attention At (he
last ses ion, the rules of proceeding, as comprised in Jeffer
son's Manual, were expiesslyand constitutionally adóptelas
rules of this House It is therefore, as much a rule of this
Iloube as any other, and stands on the same f lonng and autho
my as every other liut it is said that it is Mi Teff ison s
"marginal note" of the case m Grev'^Dphates " which íelatrtl
to the execution of Armstrong, and the motion for his execution
m-ulefts attorney General by Sir RobeitSawyei a member of
t'e Hous- of Commons But surely the authonty of a rule of
thid House cannot be thus avoided A marginal note una
adotpted by the House, w uld have no authority as law The
queotiuu upon it would be whether it was*1 conect statement of
that case But it i* not important that a iu'e a J >pted an 1 en
acted by the Hou=<e for its government «houUlbefnumedupnii,
or in conformity with, any pre existing case It is not Oiey b
Ptrliamentaiy Dehatcs that is adopted but the )ati"n f oi
this rule and, by i sown language and terms, according to hen
obvious and kn >wn meaning, it must be intepretei and applied
It is the power of the House which gives u life and iu ho
ntv, an 1 creates ita nneof the House Call it a marginal n n,
oi Mr Jeffeison's note, or Mi Tefierson's invention irbyany
other name, the thing is still the same If its principle I^d
e\en be^n mcotreetly deduced fiftm rase1* 11 which the author
of the Mmual supposed he found it still tht Hou^e has adopted

wholesome and light in that f rim It is v* holi> immater il in
this lespect whett er its ong "i wi m Li g'and oi"\irsmia,

It has heen suggested that (he rule m the Manual comes m
collision "with the resolution tpferr ng the ficts aidmemoiuls
formvestigation, and that these may, tnerefore, be supposed to
oven ule and supersede the rule I cannot so undet<Hand the
matter The resolutions aie in the ordinary general term* of
resolutions for inquiry by committees, and tf ihis doctt ne
were correct, then every resolution might supersede those exist
ing rules which govern «he proceeding dnected hy the ieeolu
tion But ihe rules cannat be so repealed I cannot perceive
that the rule does, in the «lightest degree, come in collision
-ftitlt any resolution passed on this subject    But, if it did, H is
the resolution that must yieldtothe rule, nolthefule ColKe
resolution It is the provine* of the rules" to (vgoverii" the
action of the House until, m the proper manner, they aie-re-
pealed By H8th rule, adopted at the last set-eion, on gmt
consideration, the rules in the JSianual are to govern, unless m
consistent with the standing noes of the House and the joint
rules of the House and Senate As it has not "fcfeen lead? l^ill
give ns words                                                                  '
"118 The Rules of Parliamentary Practice, comprised in
Jeffwson's Manual, shall govern the House in all cases to/which
they are applicable, andm which they arenot inconsistent with
the Standing Mules and Orders oi the House, and the Joint
Rutes of the ¿-enate and House of Represan tati ves "
Now, it is clear that the rule in question is not inconsistent
with the Standing and Joint Rules, or any of ttiem By its
express terms, it is applicable to the proceedings of this* com-
mittee, because this committee is ' charged with an inquiry "
Its Woids are these
" When a committee is charged with an inquiry, if a member
piove to be involved, they cannot proceed against him, but
must make a special report  to the House, whereupon, the
member is heard m his place, or at ihe bar, oi d special autho
nty is given to the committee to inquire concerning him. "
Tins piovmgto be involved^ it will be seen, takes place in
the committee chargStí with the inquiry 'I hey take evidence
as to who is involved, and thereupon it proves that a member
is involved When that is established, the rule is imperative
upon them as to the form and method of further pioceeding
They cannot go on to the end of their commission, onutung
entuely the requisition of the rule, but must then make a
special report to the House, which will thereupon ei hei giv 
them a special authouty to inquire concerning the member
thus proved to be involved oi wdl order the iu ther investi-
gation and heaunff to be before itscff
Sn,this view oi the dictate of this rule has not been answer-
ed I think it cannot be answered It is certainly no answer to
say that, when the committee wasappointed.it was expected
tint menúes would prove to be involved When, m the
course of regular investigation, that docs appear, Wiiieh was
expected to apptat, then, and not before, the rule attache 
It is said that when the resolutions we^e passed, most, if not
ail, of the membeis of the House believed, nay, knew to a mo
ral certainty, that some of its members would bo affected by
the investigation Weil, sir in the instances inch I put be
í*ue, oí u man slam openly in a crowd, ot m í e j re^ei ee of a
eeuit, theieisa belief, there is a moral ccruinn m the minds
ot all as to the natureof thp fa t, andas'i fi#-n udual who
will be charged and be the subject of the trial ¡< is e&pec ed
that he will be th mdit'dudl who will b* named in the indict
ment Still the laws of proceeding cannot lor that cause be
dispensed with Every form and rule of proceeding must be
observed, as if there was no such belief oi expectation ihe
rule foi one is the rule for all The word3 of ihe i ule expressly
exclude all idea of an tmphed authority It must be "special
authouty," it cannot, therefore be implied fiom any belief or
supposed knowledge on the part of the members of the. House
And it may be observed that no si*ch bel ef or knowledge ap
pears many recoit1 oi prociedi lg ot the House nor could re
gulaily appeal, except upon a special report oí the committee
according to the rule, or upon an investigation conducted in the
House
In regard to this it must be perceive 1 that the comse taken
by the commutes would deprive the Hou^e of the option re
served to it by the rule It is the light of an accused meinbei
to be heardupon the charge somewhere It is at the option ol
the Hou^e after he is personally charged befoie them, and as
soon as they have official possession of that fact ei iiei to hear
him and pursue the whole investigation and trial in the House,
ortogivetotheircommittsespecialauthonty Mo inquire con
ceining him," and report the evidence in which case be may
be present, and heard in the taking of the evidencebefoie the
committee It is also tl e right of the merrberthaf this opt1 on
phuul'i be ixercfeed by the House, and he may give reasons foi
oragam^teithei course But by the method pursued by the
committee, this option would betaken away from the House
Mi bpeakei my single object in the6e remarks has'"ten to
explain the reasons ol my vote When that is dene, I shall
have acquitted myself of all I deemed it necessary or desirable

the motives of anyone, crin any manner to wander fiom the
question to be now taken 1 wish that my own action should

and certiml) m this House no[ familnr question, it is neces
¡eary that we should examine carefully the ground on winch we
are advancing, and see that every part of it on which we am
about to plant sur feet is solid and nun The People have a
right to demand that their legislators should m such a | roceed
ing, íegard all the established landmarks, and adhere to ihe
fixed laws and lu'es of proceeding m existence at the time
lney have a right ts this as a portion of ihe standing laws of
the land I fpel hound, in honor and in conscience, o a strict
observance of this rule of the House by the same obligation
and under the «¡ame sanction of the oath I have h* re taHen to
