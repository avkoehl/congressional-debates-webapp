SIR: I have the honor to report that the engagement to my left is still going on, supposed to be General Brannan's division, and distant about 2 miles north of this point. Colonel Grose, so far as I learn, is not engaged, but I have ordered General Palmer to move up with the balance of his division, and to aid General Thomas with the whole.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

General GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

SIR: Your note of 12.20 is this moment received. Before its receipt I did not understand the movement, and feared that my troops were being driven back. I now understand it. General Van Cleve is just going in with two brigades where he will perhaps take the enemy on left or rear and enable General Thomas' right (refused) to act as reserve. I have sent General Wood word. Lodor and McKibbin have just returned.

Very respectfully,

T. L. CRITTENDEN.

Very respectfully,
