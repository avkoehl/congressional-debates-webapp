tween the Court-House and the Church, expecting thereby to distract our attention and so get an opportunity to press forward his infantry for assault. Most likely his chief effort will be made near the corner where the road from the Court-House toward Massaponax Church crosses our line. That region of our line is deemed less strong than some others. It has been examined, and its defense arranged by General Smith, engineer, Colonel Walker, whose proper command is there, General Long, and myself, but we wish your judgment exercised also upon it. Besides, a few more guns near there in reserve, or in position on the line, may be valuable, and we shall have to depend on your reserve for them, as all Walker's and Long's are exhausted. Will you be so good as to visit the locality in the morning as soon as you can see at all, and have up near there in some safe place say an additional battery - any additions you deem important. Please confer with Colonel Walker about it, if you can find him; he is at the Frazier house, on the left hand, as you go from your headquarters to the Court-House. If you cannot see him, arrange for what you deem best with Lieutenant-Colonel Richardson, commanding the guns near there.

Very truly, your obedient servant,

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.

Shells are pretty lively all about the Court-House, and between there and the Frazier house.
