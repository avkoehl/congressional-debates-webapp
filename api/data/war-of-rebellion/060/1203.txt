d Not heretofore reported.

Major-General Breckinridge is now absent in Monroe County and will not return for several days. As this report had already been delayed, and as General B. was not in command during the period it covers, I have thought it best, in the absence of the commanding general, to forward it at once.

C. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
