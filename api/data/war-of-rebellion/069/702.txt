I shall have all my guns in position by dark. I think I have a position that can't be taken or turned unless the other divisions give way, and which I don't much think will be attacked. I am going to burn a house near my right about dusk, which is too far out for my pickets to hold, and from which they annoy us much.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
