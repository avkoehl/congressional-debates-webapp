Ho. of Bess.
the people of each, and those of such asmightbe-
come States of it, anil their posterity, such attrib-
utes, the principles of which were Uy Jefferson and
Madison embodied in a party creed, and soably
defended by them, Jackson, and Douglas, arid
to-day, as ever, maintained by the Democratic
party, and upon which only can thisGrovernment
be successfully administered, which 1 shall show
that the now Administration party held but for the
purpose of obtaining the power that it is now
wielding for its destruction, in which, its masses
are necessarily, by force of its organization,
though unconsciously, participating. Our Gov-
ernment, by reason of the unprecedented freedom,
integrity, devotion, happiness, and prosperity of
her citizens, consequent upon its having been ad-
ministered so long, as the Administration party
promised that they would, that is, "on the prin-
ciples of our fathers," had become the most pow-
erful and renowned of earth's empires, and so
loved and venerated by her own, and feared and
envied by most, and admired by all others, as to
have been invincible by foreign foes. Having
become too dear to her own to have fallen in a
conflict with all others that could have been com-
bined against her, but never so mighty that it may
not from its maladministration, the fabric of
which, though as equitable, strong, and durable
as human wisdom and integrity could have de-
vised, is equally delicate and wholly dependent
upon it£ being administered in good faith and
strict conformity to the law of its organization,
which will secure for it an allegiance of our peo-
ple so tenacious, and a respect of all others so
profound as to perpetuate it with man's proba-
tionary time without any compromise whatever,
as its founders in its formation so conceded to,
and provided for sections and conflicting interests
and its institutions, as to have rendered any un-
necessary to such perpetuation, unless in conse-
quence of usurpationsor violations of constitu-
tional rights.
The formation of governments involves the
most vital questions of a temporal nature. They
are based on the volition of the people or that of
tyrants. The former is sustained by the appre-
ciation of the people. The latter, in disregard for
and contempt thereof, and by withholding from
them the right of self-government with the purse
and sword, through which monopolies and ex-
clusive privileges are established and maintained.
Of what avail to the people are the reserved
rights of the States if that of retaining oraltering
their governments are not of them, and held in-
violable? As only through such governments
can they exercise any of such rights, of which
the original States have no more or different than
the new, which by the provisions of the Consti-
tution were admitted on an equality with them.
The leaders of the people of the States in rebel-
lion having become rebels, and established the
so-called confederacy for the purpose of obtaining,
as they supposed they might, better security for
their State governments, certainly would not, if
they could, have destroyed governments for
which they have exercised a criminal attachment.
Nor would the masses of them, then, so gener-
ally, as ever before attached to the Union, have,
if they could. The so-called confederate govern-
ment, not being one dejure, never had the poli-
tical power to abolish those State governments
which are; and were it such an one,it could not,
for the right to preserve, administer and alter such
governments, are of the rights reserved by each
of such States of the so-called confederacy. No
one would, I think, be so presumptuous as to assert
that those governments, or any of them, have
been overthrown, unless by the action—I use
the word action, as it and overthrowed are cor-
relative terms—of some of the powers or so-called
powers of which I have spoken in that connection,
nor foolish or devoid of self-respect as to insist
tiiat they, or any of them, have thus been. Nor
do any who are attached to free institutions, and
are uncontaminated with the anti-republican here-
sies which alone constitute the creed of most of
the leaders of this Administration, desire that
they should be, much less would any such as-
sume that they were, believing as do all patriots,
that upon their existence and exercise in and
with all the dignity, individuality, equality, in-
dependence, majesty, and supremacy, emanat-
ing from their inherent and reserved lights, as
inviolable by Federal intervention as foreign in-
vasion, depends the personal liberty and rights
ofthe people of every State, the permanency of
our Government, and the progress of free institu-
tions on earth. Yet the advocates of this bill,
who fully understand it, do so desire, because of
their purpose thereby manifested, of inflicting.on
humanity that devastation and despair which I
have stated would result from such overthrow,
as I think I have shown and expect further to
when 1 refer to the provisions of the bill, or so
many thereof as time will admit, every section
of which so fully bears the impress of such pur-
pose as to induce the resistless, and yet morti-
fying, humiliating, and fearful conviction that
should it receive the formal sanction required to
make laws, though unconstitutional^ it will then
be for the want of that cognizance of the subject-
matter of its provisions by any of the depart-
ments of this Government necessary to giveitthe
force of law. It would nevertheless by the sword
and treasure of the people, degraded and defied
by its passage, be unscrupulously and cruelly
enforced against their common will, sentiment,
and vested rights, as a means of producing such
consequences, and thereby rendering restoration
impossible, and revolution, in accordance with
their despotic desires,successful, permanent,and
supreme.
Admitting—which I do only to show the absurd-
ity of the title of the bill—that those States exist
with their governments overthrown, yet govern-
ments which have been overthrown have no exist-
ence ; so this bill proposes to guaranty that which it
asserts has no existence, though the word-imports,
and any act, agreement, or contract that constitutes
a guarantee implies the existence of something to
which the guarantee relates as secondary thereto,
and intended to secure to the guarantee. The pro-
visions of the Constitution claimed in the title to
the bill as a sanction for its provisions, require the
United States to guaranty to every State in the
Uniona republican form ofgovevnment, and there-
fore can operate under such provision only upon
governments and in the relation of a guarantor of
republican forms of government for the States,
and not in that of a founder of governments of
any kind, however republican in form, nor in that
of intermeddling with any such governments by
legislating upon matters legislation on which is
reserved to the States respectively or to the peo-
ple, or changing or suspending the operation of
such governments or the laws thereof, or lim-
iting their powers, and consequently is wholly
inapplicable to States whose governments have
been overthrown, (admitting that there are such,)
and was inserted and intended to secure to them
the enjoyment of such governments, republican
in form, as they may have made for themselves.
Why this absurdity in the title of a bill, framed
by men of such legislative and legal experience
and acquirements and distinguished ability ? Be-
cause, as I think, of their inordinate desire, under
the guise of some constitutional provision, to pass
a bill subversive of the reserved rights of the peo-
ple of such States, that this Administration may,
(in the name of the Constitution and under pre-
tense of devotion to the Union,) usurp powers,
of which that instrument recognizes each of the
States sovereign, and of which they would be
without such recognition, which is merely de-
claratory, and was dictated by unnecessary cau-
tion, arising from unabating attachment to such
rights and restless fears of their interdiction, and
of their inability to select any other provision of
that instrument which they could, as they sup-
pose, more successfully prostitute to their mon-
strous designs against these States, and the Union
of all the States, and, as an inevitable consequence,
against the people of ail the States.
That gentlemen, who never could have become
members of this body without having taken the
oath prescribed to and required of them by that
instrument to support it, and can exercise no
power not therein authorized, should attempt by
a willful perversion of that instrument to usurp
powers coveted by tyrants only would be incred-
ible to one ignorant of the provisions of this bill
and the history of this Administration, and espe-
cially as they, as members of this House, are
chosen more directly and frequently by the peo-
ple than any other inourjbente of any of the. de-
partments of the Government; and are supposed
to,and should, more than any others, reflect their
folitical sentiments and. appreciate their wa:n,ts.
'his House is, under the theory of our Govern-
ment, one of the important divisions of a depart-
ment, without which it would not be republican:;
is more democratic and closely allied to the peo-
ple of the States than any other division of the de-
partments of the Government or department there-
of, and was organized as the mosit powerful and
reliable barrier of the people of the States, as such,
against any attempted usurpations of the United
States; I need not add centralization of powjer,
as all such usurpations inevitabiy tend to it, The
political relations between the members of this
body and the United States and States being so
sacred, important, delicate, and confidential, and
being so fixed by the Constitution, does not the
claim of constitutionality for this bill render its
authors guilty of the moral and political crime of
not only ingratitude to the memories oftheframers
of the Constitution but of slander thereof, and
infidelity and treachery to the .people? To the
extent that powers were delegatedsto the United
States by the States, through the Constitution of
the United States, and were by it prohibited to the
States. The United States are sovereign, and will
so remain as to those so delegated and prohibited,
as far as not modified or withdrawn, in conformity
with that instrument, until they shall become ex-
tinct, if ever, by reason of the destruction of that
instrument when they will revert to the people of
each State, who retain the reversion thereof,
as are and will be those, which each of those
States possessed when independent sovereign-
ties,and not thus delegated by,nor prohibited to>,
them in such instrument so long as their govern-
ments exist. And yet there was no division of
power, for the reason that the whole so delegated
to the United States and prohibited to the States,
was an emanation of the separate and voluntary
act of nine of the thirteen States that composed
the Confederation, in a Convention called for the
amendment of the Articles thereof, which act was
a violation of such Articles, which declared that
the Union under it should be perpetual. Yet by
such act alone the Union was created, and the
nine States thereof became foreign to the other
four; two of which, Rhode Island and North
Carolina, were so treated by acts of Congress,
under the Administration of the immortal Wash-
ington; and was, therefore, not a partition of
powers, but delegation thereof wholly, though
ordinarily designated as delegated and prohibited
powers, as a partition of powers can be made only
between two or more governments or parties
jointly possessing them, which relationship is re-
quisite to the division of political or other powers,
and did not exist between the United States and the
nine States, nor any of them; for that the United
States, and the Government thereof, having been
created only by the delegation and prohibition of
powers by the States, could not have existed until
the consummation of such act of delegation and
prohibition; which was the adoption of the Con-
stitution, which isacompact between all the States
of the Union only, entered into originally by such
nine of them acting through their respective ma-
jorities and State organizations, for the establish-
ment for themselves and posterity of this their
General Government for specifically named and
clearly limited common purposes.
Though this Administration obtained power, and
most if not all ofthe supporters of this bill their
places in this House, by such professions of devo-
tion to the rights of each State of the Union as were
incorporated in its party platform of 1860, which
are " that the maintenance inviolate of the rights
of the States, and especially the right of each
State to order and control its own domestic insti-
tutions according to its own judgment exclu-
sively, is essential to that balance of power upon
which the perfection and endurance of our politi-
cal fabric depend," thus asserting not only as
fully and positively as language can the rights of
the States, and especially of each State, so to
govern exclusively itself, but holding that upon
the maintenance inviolate of the exclusive exer-
cise of such rights by the people of each State
depends the existence of our Government. Yet
that party, which includes the friends of this bill,
