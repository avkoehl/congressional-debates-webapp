SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864.

General MEADE:

A battery of the enemy on my extreme left so enfilades my lines as to prevent my formation for another attack until it can be silenced. I am trying to get artillery in position now to effect this, and will then try another assault on General Barlow's front. He thinks if the battery is silenced be may be able to carry their line.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 3, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you send General Birney with his division immediately to report to General Warren. General Birney should move to General Warren by way of Woody's. A guide is sent to conduct him.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 3, 1864-10.30 [a. m.]

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: A prisoner reports that Breckinridge's command lost the pits in my front, and it was part of Hill's corps (troops recently assigned) which retook them. I am engaged in cutting roads to and putting batteries in positions with the hope of silencing the guns that have so destructive a fire on my left. I will let you know very soon whether I will make another attack. As yet I do not get much encouragement from commanders to hope for a successful issue to an attack.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 3, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: There are some indications that the enemy are arranging to retire form that part of their line in my front. They are seen at work about 1,200 yards distant, constructing apparently a redoubt and throwing up rifle-pits. If they retire to a new line on my left they would uncover the Dispatch Station road. They are certainly busily engaged at work some distance in rear of the line they now hold. I hope so to command their position to-morrow morning as to force them back if they still hold their present line.

Your obedient servant,WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

I send you a flag captured by the First Division.
