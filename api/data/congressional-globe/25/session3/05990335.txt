River and Harbor huprawments—Mr, Marvvtu
Ho. of'Reps.
very great, and must m a short time be still greater Tor,
along the whole southern coast of Lake Ontario runs the
trie canal, south lrom Rochester, extending across the
Stile of New York, will be the (ípne«ee valley eanaJ,
stretching from Big Sodus bay to the Sti^quehnnnab river,
another communication, from Cfcwego to the trie canal n
another, fiom the same pi ice to foyracuse or Ltica will foe
a railroad, parallel to the Erie canal, the Great Western
railway, beginning it the Atlantic, and terminating at the
lakes, and through the southern part of the State bull an
other, intersecting the two transverse communications "
Sir, we might here stop and pause in admira^
tion at the wondeiful change which has been
wrought on that frontier Since the war of 1812,
and in that noble State whose shoies are washed
by the billows of the Atlantic, and the waves of
Erie and Ontario The question might be asked,
and it would be peitment, to what power, to
whose enterpuse, is the United States—yes, sir,
the United States—indebted for these works of
intercommunication, which enable them to trans-
port troops and munitions of war with a celerity
and at an expense unknown in any other part of
the world' But, sir, I will continue to descube
things as they exist, and for the present leave gen-
tlemen to make the application, begging them to
bear in mind that my proposition is, that this
Government is bound to defend the country, and
that these harbors are necessary for the defense
of one of its most impoitant frontieis.
In the extract which I have just given fiom
Mr Smith's report, mention is made of Big Sodus
bay, and it is said to be large enough to contain
a fleet of any size. In the lepoit made last year
by the local superintendent, Mr Swift, I find this
description of Big Sodus bay
" This bay extends to the south five miles from its en
trance into Lake Ontario and two and a hall nulei in
width which formal s,heelnf waterof tv\ elvp sauarp mills
affording an anchorage to any number of vessels of the in
creasing navigation ol the lake in water ot lrom twelve to
forty feet m depth "
He adds that " it is now connecting with Lakes
Cayuga and Seneca and the river Susquehannah
by a canal and a railroad "
Now, sir, this harboi or bay was inaccessible
from the lake by reason of a sand bar at its en-
tranceorcommumcation with the lake At a mod-
erate expense the obstruction maybe removed,
and vessels in time of war may take shekel here,
where they will be perfectly safe, as the entrance
to the bay may be easily defended
Sir, I nave not been thus particular in calling
the attention of the House to a particular descrip-
tion of some of these haibors on Lake Ontauo
because they are more important, in a military
point of view, than others, for such is not the
fact     They are all important, and aie all inti-
mately connected with the interior by means of
roads, canals, rivers, and railways, and most of
them have a large commerce with Canada, and
with remote parts of the United States   The tiade
between Oswego and the uppei lakes is very great
And are these mere woiks of local interest, con-
structed for the sole benefit of the towns or vil-
lages near them ? This is a nairow, limited, and
illiberal view of the whole matter, unworthy of
the spirit of the age in which we live     I have
already remarked that thete are no natural har-
bors on the southern shore of Lake Erie, and per-
haps there is no more dangerous navigation in
the world than upon this lake     If, m case of a
war between this country and Gieat Britain, we
are to have the command of this lake, we must
complete the haibors on our coast, and keep them
in a safe condition     Without them, it wou d be
impossible  to maintain a navy upon the lake
Your ships might be destroyed by the elements
in a much less time than was consumed in their
construction     If hostilities shall ever break out
on that frontier, the battle must be fought on the
water.   The enemy must never be allowed to set
foot upon our soil   Our cities and villages are now
scattered all along upon the border, and if an ene-
my were allowed to land upon our shoies, the
destruction to property would now be far greater
than in the late war  The íeportof the committee
speaks of " steam batteries" for the defense of
harbors, and suggests the piopnety, instead of
authorizing any further expenditures for fortifi-
cations, that, for the present, we confine our ex-
penditures to the armament of the fortifications
we have finished, and await the result of future
experiments, which will become necessary to as-
certain whether floating steam batteries are not
superior to stationaiy fortifications in guarding
the entrance into, and in defending haibors
I am inclined, myself, to the opinion, that our
system of harbor defense along the coast will, in
a short time, undergo an entire revolution, and,
instead of depending upon fortifications on the
land, our fortifications will be built upon the water,
and will be floated by the power of steam from
place to place in our large bays and harbors    But
if this mode of defense is to be resorted to, will
it dispense with the necessity of harbors'   Most
assuiedly not    Perhaps the gentleman, while
writing this part of his report, had no thoughts
of these inland seas which divide us fro m a foreign
country,and over which, in case of war, we must
have the command, over which we must be só-
pleme, cost what it may, for we have no fortifi-
cations along their shores to defend our numerous
cities and villages    I am of the opinion, sit, that
our supremacy upon these waters is to be secured
and maintained by armed steamboats, which, in
stead of being subject to the instability of the
winds, will be, under ordinary circumstances,
propelled by steam, and move tiom one end of
the lake to the other    A very few of them will,
in all probability, be sufficient to defend oui com-
merce on the lakes and the country boidering on
them   But you can neither have steam batteries,
steam ships, or boats, or vessels, oi navy of any
kind upon these lakes without haibors     Why,
sir, I have been, and still am, astonished at the
peisevenng opposition which is made to all ap-
propriations having for their object the improve-
ment of the country    On the score of economy,
there never weie, in myjudgment, any $2,000,000
more ]udiciously expended, if we look simply to
the placing of the country in a proper state of
defense, than the $2,000,000 expended upon these j
harbors     I have been looking into the expendi-
tui es of this Govern ment, and I find that, previous
to 1812, the expend nuies for what is called " mil
itary sen ices, including fortifications, aiseoals,
armories,ordnance, internal improvements, "óV ,
varied fiom #632,807 to (in 1809) #3,335,772   In
1811 they were $3,032,828   The aveiage to 1812
is between one and two millions annually    In
18-12 these expenditures rose to $11,817,798, in
1813 to $19,652,013, in 1814 to «20,350,806, in
1815 they were $14,794,294   in 1816 they were
#16,012,096, thus showing the expendituies under
this head in five years to amount to $82,627,007
This, su, was a pari of the cost of the second war
of independence, and I have called the attention
of the House to these items for the purpose of
remarking that wars aie very expensive at all
times, and that their expense is very greally en-
hanced in the absence of all facilities for cairying
them on     A large portion of this amount was
expended in the defense of the northern fiontier
I maintain that at the present time, in the pres-
ent improved condition of the country, with our
extensive works of internal impiovemcnt con-
necting all sections of the interior with the fron
tier, with our numerous harbors on the lakes,
and with the great resources of the country in the
immediate neighborhood of the seat of war, all
the military operations which were  then per-
formed could now be performed at an expense to
the United States not exceeding fifty per cent of
the amount which was then actually and neces-
sarily expended     How immensely important,
then, in a military point of view, do all these
improvements become    Our documents show us
that the war in Florida with a few Indians, which
has been going on for two or three years, and
which is not yet terminated, has cost us about
|20,000,000   And why has it been so expensive 
One reason is that you had to create and bring
into existence there nearlyeverythmg which was
l necessary for the prosecution of the war    Large
1 ¡sums have been expended in making roads and
constructing bridges for the army—your wagons
were to be imported—from five to ten thousand
dollars a month have been paid for the use ot
steamboats—nothing could be done without great
expense, owing to the condition of the country,
and the want on the spot of all the facilities for
conducting the war     I do not mean to say that
, there has not been great extravagance there, a
wasteful and prodigal expenditure of the public
I money    frbeliere that there has been, but in the
unimproved condition in which that portion of the
country was at the time that the war broke out—
Í mean, sir,destitute of all the resources, the aids
upon which an army relies—the expenditures at
best must have been great Would it not have
been good policy, if this war could have been
foreseen, to have expended a million or two of
dolíais in cieating in that country the necessary
facilities for the army'
Su, there have been expended since the organ-
ization of the Government under the presen t Con-
stitution, up to 1837, inclusive, forwhat is called
the " military service," including fortifications,
&c , $234,549,966 The "naval establishment"
has cost us, for the same period, $134,881,122.
Out of the foimer sum about two millions have
been expended in the construction of haibora
upon the noithern and northwestern lakes, upon
a coast of about two thousand miles in extent,
for one -of the most impoi tant and exposed fron-
tieis, and which expenditure, I venture to say,
has been moie pioductive in developing the re-
souiees of the country, in strengthening and in-
creasing its power, in binding together in the
strong bonds of interest distant and remote sec-
tions of this great country, than double the like
expenditure anywhere else, and yet, notwith-
standing all these beneficial effects, these great
national icsults fiom so small an outlay, the cry
of denunciation, from a certain quarter, is con-
stantly heard upon this floor, and now the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means come in, and, with
all the powei which their position gives them,
unite with the enemies of these works
But it is time, sir, that I proceed to consider
the impoitance of these works m their relation to
commerce, and here I greatly deceive myself, if
I shall not be able to vindicate the national char-
acter of and general interest in them I lay down
ihe proposition, in the beginning, that it is the
duty of this General Government to afford pro-
tection to the commerce of the country. It is a
national obligation, and arises out of the very
nature and objects of the Union This Govern-
ment possesses the exclusive power to regulate
| commerce with foreign nations, and among the
several States It possesses the exclusive power
' of levying imposts, and collecting duties. One
gieat object in the formation of the present Con-
stitution was the protection of our commerce,
and that there should be a system of commerce
for the whole countiy—a umloimity in commer-
cial laws and regulations The proposition which
I lay down will not be disputed as long as we
expend annually so many millions in supporting
our Navy upon the high seas for the protection
of our commerce in all parts of the world, and
m constructing harbors along the sea-coast for
the safety of the meichantman.
Well, sir, I contend that the commerce on the
lakes is equally entitled to protection with that
upon the high seas The internal commerce of
any country is as important to it as Us txUrnalj
indeed, it will have little foreign commerce if its
internal commerce be limited and obstructed Fa-
cilities must be afforded for the transportation of
the productions of the mteiior, and for the intro-
duction of foieign articles for consumption m ex-
If gentlemen will turn their attention to the
actual state of things m this country, I apprehend
that they will find that the internal, the domesfic
trade of this country, far exceeds its foreign trade.
I mean, that the commerce, in the productions of
the country, among the several States of this
Union, and the people of those States, far trans-
cends all the foreign commerce of this country.
Much of this commerce is carried on between
States separated many hundred or a thousand
miles from each other, and the channels of com-
munication are the great lakes upon your north-
ern border, your mighty riveis which penetrate
the inteiiorfor thousands of miles from the ocean.
Now, sir, it is idle to say that you will spend
millions annually for the protection of foieign
trade, and that you aie under no obligation to ex-
pend a dollai to facilitate and piotect the internal
tiade of the country Allow me, sir, for a few
moments, to call the attention of the House to
I some of the data, showing something of the ex-
tent of this internal commeice, and every Ameu-
ean citizen may well be pioud of his country, as
