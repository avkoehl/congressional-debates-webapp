The international tolegraph system is subject to
the regulations of the convention concluded at Paris
in 1865, which adopted uniform rules, not only upon
all the principal subjects, but also for the minor
details of the service.
This document, which was prepared with the con-
currence of the directors general of all the telegraphic
administrations of Europe, and which a periodical
revision will keep constantly on a par with the dis-
coveries of science and the progress of improve-
ment, has been successively adopted by nearly all
the Governments which had not participated in its
formation; and going outside of European bound-
aries it seeks to extend its provisions over the whole
of the Old World.
Russia and Turkey have adopted it for their Euro-
pean and Asiatic possessions, and Tunis and Algiers,
united to Europe through the Italian system, have
accepted it. The Indian company desires also to
adopt it.
In the Old "World Persia and Egypt alone still
maintain theirspecialregulafcions, but there is every
reason to believe that these two States will not long
remain isolated exceptions, but will submit very
soon to the system in operation all about them.
At this moment the harmonious system attained
by the Paris confcrence would be complete if circum-
stances permitted the New World to apply its rules
in its relations with the old.
In order to render your information the morecom-
plete I herewith inclose copies of the following doc-
uments, an examination of which will enable you to
gain an idea of the details of the organization of a
service of which I have only been ablethus far to set
forth the principles:
1. Organic law of November 29,1850.
2. Decree of administration of May 8, 1867.
3. Explanatory circulars of Juno 30 and Septem-
ber 23,1867, Nos. 419 and 421.
4. Instructions upon semaphoric service.
5. Table of proceeds of bureaus of the empire in
1866.
6. Nomenclature of the system.
7. Convention of Paris.
Accept, sir, theassurance of my high consideration.

Description of a pneumatic tube employed in Paris for
•the transmission of dispatches between the central
telegraph station and the various stations in the city.
[Translation.]
About a year or fifteen months ago a largo ditch
was dug in the boulevards, at the bottom of which
was laid a subterranean tube for the transmission of
telegraphic dispatches. This tube describes a vast
and nearly regular ellipse, which starts from the
interior department (Rue Grennclle, Saint Germain)
and returns, passing by the Rue des Saints Peres,
the Caroussel, the post office, (Rue J. J. Rousseau,)
the Bourse, the Grand hotel, the Rue Boissy d'Ang-
lais, and the Place do la Concorde; making eight
stations in all.
Since the establishment of the telegraph the oflico
of the minister of the interior, in the Rue Grennclle,
has been the central point for the arrival and de-
parture of all dispatches to and from the provinces.
The rapid increase of the number of dispatches,
however, gave rise to considerable difficulty as
regards their distribution. Now, the rapidity of the
telegraph loses all its advantages when the distance
to be traversed becomes too small; there would never
be a sufficient number of carriers. Hcnce a certain
number of special telegraph offices were created,
communicating by wires with the central station in
the RueGreimelle. These offices of distribution, how-
ever, were soon overloaded with dispatches, and it
became necessary to deliver them from the Rue
Grennelle to thedilferentdistributing stations, not by
the wires, which had become inadequate, but by
means of carriage. This was no longer telegraphy,
and a better method was successfully sought. An
engineer of the telegraphic administration conceived
theidea^ of applying the atmospheric system, with
appropriate modifications, to the transmission of
dispatches in Paris. This was not easy to bo accom-
plished in view of the dislike felt toward inventions
which are not in accordance with the 44 aristocratic
system." However, M. Lecomte—that, I believe, is
the name of the engineer—accomplished his purpose;
his system was adopted and is still in operation.
An iron pipe, six centimeters, two and a third
inches, in diameter was laid beneath the pavements
of certain streets, forming a complete circuit, upon
the route above indicated. In each of the stations
was placed an engine whioh compresses air and
forces a small metal box through the pipe. This box
in the course of two or three minutes reaches the next
station. Every fifteen minutes n, number of these
little boxes leave the office in the Rue Grennelle, and
passes through all the stations in the circuit, stop-
ping at each. The boxes are opened, the dispatches
taken out, others placed in, and they continue their
circular course, returning finally to the pointof their
departure. The actual timo of transit is, I believe,
twenty minutes, and including the six stoppages
nearly forty.

Paris, or any point in France  7 80

Lisbon, or any point in Portugal  9 10
Brussels, or any point in Belgium  8 66

These rates are for ten words or less, count-
ing address and signature, but not date if writ-
ten by th e party sending the dispatch. Beyond
Great Britain and France the continental
tariff, as of $1 19 to Madrid, is for twenty
words or less. The rates of cable dispatches
have been reduced step by step from $100 to
the present rates; and it is worthy of remark
that every reduction has been followed by
increase of receipts. When the rates were
reduced from £5 to £3 17s. Gd. the receipts
jumped from £495 to £525 per day.
