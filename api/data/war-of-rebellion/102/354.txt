HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI,Warrensburg, Mo., May 8, 1865.

Major J. W. BARNES,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Missouri:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that my communications by telegraph, addressed to the general commanding the department, did not state the whole case respecting the present raid in this district. There are more rebels who claim to be Confederate soldiers, and there are more bushwhackers proper who are at work than I believed to be on my hands. I have all my men at work. I doubt if I have not weakened this post too much, as I find call for troops every day. The telegram announcing that another regiment is to be sent to me relieves me of some anxiety. I am going myself to look at matters beyond my immediate supervision, and hope to have them in good condition in every part of the district as they are in the Fourth Sub-District. Captain Laurant, assistant adjutant-general, will attend to all business in my absence.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A citizen has just reported to me of a gang of guerrillas, supposed to be about 100, passing north; thinks they crossed the railroad at the tank west of Dresden, going in the direction of Dunksburg; passed his house about 3 o'clock last night.

Have sent a messenger to Captain Donohue. From what I can learn the guerrillas are making in the direction of Pisgah. Have sent in that direction, with orders to pursue as long as possible.

Colonel HARDING:

Jim Anderson and Bill Pool with forty men are beyond doubt in Greenton Valley. They reconnoitered Le Clair's camp this morning, and discussed the possibility of attacking. His men are absent but about twenty. I have sent troops to take care of the devils.
