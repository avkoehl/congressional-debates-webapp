favorable recommendation. Shall I write a separate letter? I think the case worthy of the President clemency. Smith desires to resume his Etowah business. Will he be permitted to do so, having taken the oath? I don't think a more desirable state of affairs could prevail than now obtains over all of Georgia, west and south of the Ogeechee and Altamaha. All that is needed to protect the Government is an ample force for the Treasury Department and proper representatives of the Freedmen's Bureay. The district about Atlanta is in a starving condition. Too vigorous measures to prevent suffering cannot be inaugurated. I have reported by telegraph to General Steedman, though don't yet know where he is.

MACON, July 2, 1865.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Joseph E. Brown has returned from Washington and issued an address to the people of Georgia resigning his office of Governor, and counseling them what course to follow. Unless he had done this by direction and permission of the President, I think he should be arrested and removed to a Northern prison. I will forward to General Steedman a copy of his address and his parole.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

General Wilson need not send any more cavalry to South Carolina than General Gillmore thinks he will require.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

General Woods can take his staff with him. There is no need of sending more troops to Alabama, at least not until he (Woods) gets there and finds he will need them. We want now to discharge all troops that can be dispensed with. All the troops now in Alabama Woods will assume command of on his arrival.
