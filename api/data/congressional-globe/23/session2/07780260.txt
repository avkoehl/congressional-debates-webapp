THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 18,
Mississippi, that the lemarks he nad just made,
sod the course he had indica'ed as the most xppio
Dnate one to be pursued in tins case, were not
ex.t emely regular If the pioposuion (said he)
contains matter derogatory to the dignity of
this body, and mdecoious in itself, then it may
with propriety be airested in its incipient state
But it is not said that this resolution is indecorous
or derogatory to the Senate The honoiabie gen-
tleman says it is unconstitutional to alter a Jour-
nal But is it not most ma.ufest that the gentleman
anticipates the decision of the case, which would
be much moie piopei at another timef The exact
question to be decided is, whether the lesolution
is constitu tonal or not But there is another
question intimately connected with this matter
which mey well audiess itself to the consideration
of the ¡Senate Several of the State Legislatures
have pas„ed íesolutions expiessive of their opin-
ions upon the very point to which this proposition
distinctly app'ies, and wilt the Sei ate, represent
mg the soveieignties of the several Spates, refuse
Jo listen to this pioposuion expressed by the regu-
lar constitutional oigan of the States' If it be so,
howevei honorable gentlemen may profess to rev-
erence State lights, certim it is that such a course
is much better calculated to bring contempt upon
the rights of the States than any other course that
could be pursued Yes, sn, the case is presented
of the Senate's lefusiig to eriteuain a proposition |
upon which the States themselves have expressed
it solemn and deliberate opinion If tins doctrine
be tiue, the 'estimate consequence is that ail
legislation must be ot fled Whenever an impoit-
antqueoLion ispiesemed which involves a question
ofcoiisiuutiomlity—and the eaie many which are
(supposed to do so at the thieshold—the honoiabie
gentleman mi ¿In use in his place md move that it
be notcOnsidued The practice is caLulited to
suppress inquiry, and ought not to be admitted
¡suppose an aibitruiy majority of the Senate should
leiuse to enteitam a pioposition which was upon
its face manifestly prope , but which did not ex
aetly quadiate with then own notions, would
the Senate suppress or deny inquiry by refusing
to receive it' It was so clearly inadmissible that
I e could not assent to the honorable gentleman's
motion
Mi   I CKrll expressed a wish that the gentle-
man from Mississippi would withdiawhis motion
not to leceive the pioposuion     For it must be
evident to every gentleman that the debate must
come up upon his motion,if it was notwithdrawn

On motion of Mr POINDEXTER, the Senate
resumed, as in Committee of the Whole, the bill
suoplementary to the act granting a township of
land to certain exiles from Poland
After adopting an amendment submitted by Mr
ROBINSON, confining the Poles to such lands as
have not been settled, and which have been sur-
veyed,

engrossment of the hill, which were oidered, and

THE FOUR YEARS*' LAW.
The Senate then resu vied the consideration of
the bill to iepeal the act limiting the teim of cer
tain offi ers, commonly called the foui yeais' law, ¡

Mr CLAY said, the std ject under considera
lion was one on which he hid felt extiemely
anxious, and one lnvohm ' the sime pnnciples as
those on which he had he bonoi at the last ses-
sion to oiFei a resolution to 'he Senile These
punciiles were the lesults of lmg and mature
reflection, and from then bein^ mcoi porated in the
bill, he felt called upon to defend it He would
say, that he differed wnh the gentleman fiom New
Y< rk, [Mi Wrioh-i ] m his (ompatisoii of the
dangers las! wintti ai a this. lie knew that the
scenes alluded to, arose Aon one of the most
extiaoidinaiy measuies ever witnessed in a free
Government He saw no congruiiy between those
measmes and the preset t leport That was no
less than the a"sum| dor of all power by one pei-
son as was shown by tl.eiemovalof the deposites, i
by tne piotest, and by the lepoit of the becretary ,
of the Tieasury B it he icgietted tliatany lefer
ence had oeen made to the bank iNoilung moie (
could be hopeü lot in fivt r of that i stituti n It
was gone, and no one could evei expectjt rechai I
ter, espec ally if he looked to the disp isit un of the
othei House, and to diffeient sections of the coun
try fie believed its affuis had been jusily and
properly adinims'ered B it he was not disposed
t) look too mu< h on the bright side of the ques-
tion 1 he bank was gone ano the cui rency of (lie
cmiitiy deianged On its ruins a multitude of locil
banks would spung up in every pait of these
twenty foui vove.egi Staes M )ney would be
p'*nty, property would muease ,n nominal value,
and the country be flooded with spuiious bdls It
was the misfortune of this country that the srreat
principles of reform should be connected wi*h an
unpcpulur uistiti tion lie had warned his friends
not to connect the su ¡ect of pi eventing the in 1
crease of executn e po a er with the fortunes of the '
bank He considered the bill before the Senate
totally divested of any connexion with the bank,
and separated from a'l the política! questions that
distracted the coun ry
There were duties (said Mr C ) transeerdent
duties, far paramount to party purposes—dudes
we owe our country It had been well said, that
in the perpetual tuin of the political wheel, those
who are up to day may be down to-morrow, but
if we adhered to principles, to manly, independent
pinciples, it was no matter whether we were uo
oi dowm
Mr C said, in regard to the question under
consideration that the paiticipation of the Senate
in the power of appointment was merely nominal,
if it acted without the reasons of the President
For if they sanctioned an appointment, the Presi-
dent could eject the officer from his place the next
day, if he pieased If the office was once vacant,
it was bej ond the control of ihe Senate Should
they reject one nomination, the Piesident might
nominate another and another of his cieatures,
until the Senate would be forced to yield,oi leave
the office vacant
The power of removal, as now exercised, was
entirely despotic in its aophcation In the i ecesses
of theexecutivemansion, thequestion wasdecided,
while the officer remained unseen md unheard
The Piesident was sole judge, juiois, and execu-
tioner And further, it was an irresponsible pow-
ei, as, without his reasons were given, no one
could call him to an account for his actions He
was beyond the power of impeachment, if such a
thing was capable ol being piactically cairied out
in such agovernmentasours Responsibility was
as essential an ingredient of a fiee government, as
the vital air which sunounds us was necessa v
for animal life Every officei was responsible to
the people, all were public servants, and if one
servant íemoved another, he ought to render an
account, to give his reasons to the nation There
would be a day of reckoning to all, and he would
appeal to the Senate, if ihei e had not been abuse >
Mr C then referred to the íemoval of a marshal
m Maryland, and to a fnend of his in Kentucky,
who had been dismissed fiom office
The gentleman from New York [Mr Weight]
had ingeniously analyzed the mass over which
executive powei had its influence, and upon each
division asked the question, Was theie any dan-
ger in that' He (Mr C ) perfectly understood
the nature of such appeals, they were better suited
for the stump than the Senate of the United States
We had not yet felt the weight of executive in-
fluence, the power of íemoval was still in its in-
fancy scaicely six years old It had not yet been
applied to the army and navy, and coulcínot be
btought to bear on the pensioners
Suppose (said Mr C ) it should be applied to
the aimy, if an oflicer stood in the way of the
Piesident's designs, and he refused to yield, the
Piesident would remove him, and put another in
his place In this wav, the army and navy might
soon be filled with the sunple tools of executive
power Whoever would take a just view of these
principles, let him look to the nature of man
Ti e veiy tendency of these things was to pro-
duce servility There were several stages in the
descent Tirst, silence If an officei happened to
d ffei with the President on m me political points,
he would be leserved, his friends and relauoos
would advise him to be prudent, and say nothing
But the pLce admits of no neutrality, hungry px-
pectarts are ciowdmg around, and the officer
must become warm and active, or he is dismissed
Wlw a multitude of officers so situated did the
Post Office Dej artment, the custom houses, and
the land offices, furnish Tney were a well
regulated body, a corps d'armee, a rallying pom*
foi political action, forming committees of corre-
soondenee all over the country It was a revival
of the institutions of feudal times , fil'ing the land
with barons and feudatories The Scnatoi fiom
New Yoik had used the term " inherent powei "
This was a new source of power He was igno-
rant of what ti e ¡senator meant by inherent power
He had only known implied and expressed power
[Mi WriGHT here lose to explain Fiemeart
no other power than what was derived from the
C< nstitution ]
Mr CLAY then proceeded The Senator from
Pennsylvania had spoken of "sovereiDn power "
