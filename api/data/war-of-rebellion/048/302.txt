the left of the road and again formed in line of battle on the left of the brigade, and in this manner advanced about a mile, when, no enemy appearing, the column resumed its march by the flank to Catlett's Station. In this engagement the regiment met with no casualty.

At Catlett's Station the regiment was detailed to guard a road leading to the right, and from that point, when the column resumed its march, was deployed as flankers on the right and left of the brigade. On arriving near Bristoe Station, our artillery were found engaging a force of the enemy which advanced to attack the column from the hills on the left of the railroad. The men were suffering much from the fatigue of a rapid march through the underbrush and thick wood which extended along the route, but at the command assembled on the right group and formed in line of battle on the left center of the brigade. At this point one of our batteries, advancing to take position, broke through the line and caused some confusion on the left, but the regiment speedily reformed and advanced on the run, under a severe fire of musketry, to secure the embankment of the railroad, which the regiment reached simultaneously with the Thirty-ninth and One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Volunteers, which were on the right of the brigade. The regiment maintained this position behind the railroad, and assisted in the repulse and defeat of the enemy, who charged down the hill with the intention of carrying the position.

The loss of the regiment in this engagement was 2 enlisted men killed, 2 commissioned officers and 21 enlisted men wounded, and 2 enlisted men missing. Details from the regiment brought into our lines about 100 prisoners, and assisted in securing 4 guns captured by the brigade.

Both officers and men conducted themselves most gallantly through the entire action.
