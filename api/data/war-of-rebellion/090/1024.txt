Depot, then by Jordan Springs to the mouth of Abraham's Creek, where Breckinridge encamped. Ramseur marched to Winchester to meet a reported advance of the enemy from Romney. Rodes encamped at Stephenson's. The enemy made demonstrations on the Martinsburg, Berryville, and Millwood roads in the p. m., but were easily repulsed (see plate ---*). On the morning of the 11th we formed a line of battle covering the approaches to Winchester from the east and southeast, Breckinridge covering the Berryville and Millwood roads, Ramseur the Front Royal road, and Rodes the one to Martinsburg. There was some skirmishing and cannonading on the Millwood road (see plate ---*), but it was ascertained that the enemy was endeavoring to reach the Valley pike, in our rear, so Gordon was moved to the vicinity of Newtown and put in position to cover the approaches (see plate ---+); the rest of the army followed. After a brisk skirmish, about dark, on the road to the Double Toll-Gate, in which the enemy was repulsed (see plate ---+), we encamped in the vicinity of Newtown (see plate ---*). On the morning of the 12th we fell back across Cedar Creek and formed a line of battle there, the enemy forming on the north side, and some skirmishing ensued (see plate ---*). In the evening we fell back to Fisher's Hill, posting the cavalry on the flanks and in front, McCausland on the right (see plate ---*). August 13, a line of defense was selected at Fisher's Hill and occupied by troops as in plate ---+). On the 14th the enemy sent a few skirmishers across Cedar Creek and our engaged them. The enemy drove our signal men from the end of the Three-Top Mountain, but a company of sharpshooters drove them off in turn with loss (see plate ---+). August 15, we drove the enemy's pickets across Cedar Creek and reconnoitered their position.

On thee 16th General Anderson, advancing to re-enforce General Early, had his pickets attacked by the enemy at Guard Hill, near Front Royal, and suffered some loss (see plate ---#). On the morning of the 17th the enemy retreated, burning barns and hay and grain ricks as they went. We followed after them, McCausland's cavalry brigade in front, on the Valley pike, followed by Gordon, Jackson's brigade on the Middle and Johnson's on the Back road. We did not overtake the enemy until we reached Kernstown; then drove their skirmishers in and found their cavalry, supported by a brigade of infantry, posted on Bowers' Hill. Forsberg's brigade, of Wharton's division, was thrown out on the left and skirmished with the enemy; then Wharton was formed in line, with Ramseur's sharpshooters on the right, and advanced under a heavy musketry and artillery fire and drove the enemy from the hill about dark (see plate ---*). McCausland moved round to the right of Winchester and by the Berryville road. General Anderson, with Kershaw's division of infantry and Fitz Lee's cavalry, advanced to the Opequon (see plate ---*). On the 18th Rodes went a short distance on the Berryville road, Ramseur on the Martinsburg road, and Anderson encamped on the Front Royal and Millwood roads; Gordon and Wharton on Abraham's Creek; McCausland went to Stephenson's. August 19, the army marched to Bunker Hill and encamped near there, Anderson and Fitz Lee remaining at Winchester. Lomax's division of cavalry went to Martinsburg and Shepherdstown. On the 20th the cavalry had some skirmishing along the Opequon.
