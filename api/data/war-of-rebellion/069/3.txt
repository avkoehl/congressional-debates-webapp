Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The attempt to turn our right last evening was by Ewell's corps wholly. They were promptly repulsed by Birney's and Tyler's divisions and some of Warren's troops that were on the extreme right. About 300 prisoners fell into our hands, besides many killed and wounded. Our loss foots up little over 600 wounded and about 150 killed and missing. This is as near an accurate report as can be given at this time. Probably the killed and missing is overstated.

It is evident that he can move south, covering the road he has to guard, with a larger force than he can spare to be removed to re-enforce armies elsewhere. Then, too, under the instructions of General Sigel, Crook was to get through to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, cut New River bridge, and move eastward to Lynchburg, if he could; if not, to Fincastle, Staunton, and down
