26th Cong. • ••2nd Sess.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Vanderpoel.
H. of Reps.
Indian claims as presented to us by the Secretary
of the Treasury, for the coming year, amounted to
about eight hundred thousand dollar This, he
had b°en assured, would be stfficient to answer all
the purposes for the year, and as the gentleman had
already been shown 'o be so wide of the mark in
relation to other items, he wordd plac  n<^ own ina-
bility to ascertain any legitimate foundation for •
this charge, and the estimates and assurances of
the Depar'ment w ithm whose province the subject
legally came, agamsi ihe a serlion of his colleague,
that such a charge "piobably" existed
Before he dismissed the consideration of th s hat
of "ascertained an! certain" liabilities, he mist siy
a few words upon ano her most material item—one
whose amount surely entitled it to not ce He al-
laded to the sum of five millions set down by his
colleague [Mr Barnard] as the "value" of annui-
ties to Indians, pa} <iole part m perpetuity, and part
for terms of yearo How had this large amount
been attained1 The process by which it was ar-
rived at was a most extraordinary one, and well
entitled his colleague to the distinction of being a
very prodigy in cyphering out liabilities against
that "wealthy old gentlemm," (the Government)
whom he so lelicitously alluded to "i tne eoutse of
his speech The Government of the United State 
was bound by treaty stipulations to pay certain
sums annually a* annuities to certain tribes of In
dians It had not stipulated to pay them ultima e-
ly any large sum by way of principal, but *o pay
them fixed sums yearly, to some of the tribes fjr
Stipulated terms of years, and to others in perpe-
tuity The amount required to be thus annuahy
paid to these Indian tribes was about
More than this under past annuity stipula-
tions could not be annually charged upon the
Treasury But his colleague, being a little of a
lawyer, as well as poet and arithmetician, had learn
ed, no doubt, that there was such a tnmg as the
Northampton table, used by courts of cquiiy to
ascertain the value of annuities, and by way of
increasing the immediate charges upon the Trea-
sury, he sees fit to apply tms table to these annul íes
in order to ascertain thur immediate gross market
value, thus substituting for f^e inquiry, what will
the Goven ment be obliged, for four or ten years
to come, to pay on account of Indian annuities,
fhatso írrrelevant to the qaestion now befor  us,
what gro>s sum could capitalists afford to pay
immediately to the Indians for their inteiest
in these annuities1 Now, was not this mode
of fabncatirg form dable "ascertained and cer-
tain liabilities" against the Government saange,
"passing strapge1" Follow out this princi-
ple as to other fixed and annual charges, m the
form of sa'ancs, on the Treasury, in favor of
officers, some for life, and others for terms of years
He would bring h's colleague, with his new princi-
ple in its nakedness, befora the mirror which he
would now suspend, and see whether even paternal
affection would blind him to the weakness and de-
formity of his bantling Your judges hold their
offices for life, or during good behaviour, which
amounts, practically, to a life tenuie Would it
not be just as proper to apply to the salaries of all
your judges the same rule which his colleague had
applied to the Indian annuities—to ascertain then
gross and immediate value, according to the North-
ampton table, and thus swell the immediate charges
npon the Government He was very sure that his
colleague would pronounce such a process of as
certainmg the extent of the liabilities of the Go
vernment "certain" or "probable," most prepos-
terous—yes, nearly allied to madness. And yet,
for the life cf h m, he (Mr V ) ctuid not see why
the principle was not as applicable m the one case
as in the other. This was only another illustration
of the danger of staitmg with an mfltxible deter-
mination to attain a fixed result, without bemg
well assured that the means at command would 'e-
gitimately lead to it. He had too much respect for
the intellect of his colleague, not to believe that, ¡f
unclouded by political b'as, it would have avoided
the palpable heresies into which it had, on this oc-
casion, permitted itselt to lun
Another item tmt forth by gentlemen as "ascer-
tained and certam," was $1,200,000 "amount re-
quired by law to make good the deficit in the navy
pension fund " He did not see how this could be
regarded as a "positivi and certain charge" on the
Treasury The navy pension fund had been ex
hausted under the former legislation of Congress He
d d not know tnat there was any positive obligation
on the part of th  Government to replace it At
all events, Congress would, rather as matter of
gratuity, than of positive obligation, have to pro-
vide by law for replacing this fund, b fore it could
be íegarded as a cnarge on the Treasury It was
very easy to swell the "probab'e" wants of the
Treasury n one hnndrel m I ions of dollar., if
soms gentlemen v ere permitted to make their opi-
nion of whit Congress ough' to do, the basis of
"probable" or "certam" charges Tnat such opi-
nions oftentimes coitempl ited a reckless and most
prodigal system of expenditure, from which tne
econo n st and str ct con.tructionist woulu shrink
baci appalled, he need only refer to the peroration
of h s colleague's speech, in w>nch he strung to-
gether a series of fond hopes as to wnat this Admi
nistration would do, and do, too,' wiih many cow-
ardly apprehension t iat they ra gnt not be popular"
His colleague eemad to have no idea that the action
of the representative should be pplsitcl by the ft ill
of his constituent, that the approbation or d sap-
probation of th" people, shou d be a cons deration,
much to be hee ¡ed in the d scharge ot our high
dut es here
Mr V world now inquire what had become ot
th'S formidable, account of " ascertame I and cei
tain liabhti's" amounting in the aggregate to
$IG 515 0001 It would be well enough now to
make anew statement of it, with such deductions
as the views he had submitted called for. It was
curious to ^ee how little remained of it

or two now, Mr Cnairman, about them
He would not detain the committee by going
<jhrough all thes  items, a-nountmg to the modes'
sum of §19,500 000, bat woald adveit to only two,
amounmgto §14,000,000, and from such spec-
mens, the c imtmttce wou d be ab'e to form some
judgment as to the character of thns* which con-
stituted the remaining bal?nc ef j.,5 510 000 Tie
committee v.ou d be predisposed to beu«ve that th-1
gentleman's ' piobabihaes" were ro' halt as plau  -
ble as his "ce> fatnttei"—- questionable and un,ouna
as they had been shown to be The modesty of
the caption which introduced ths items upon whicn
he was about to comment, coming from one s()
bold m figares, was, of itself, a sufficient adraom-
üon to receive them wi*h much caution    The firs 
<3jO0O
item to which he would call the attention of the
committee, was the sum of "$9,000,000 for the
fourth instalment under the deposite act of 1836,
claimed by the S ates " Sir, does it not require a
bo d spirit, inde d, to dare even to intimate the pro-
bability that the people of this country will ever
consent that this Government shall increase their
tax s and burdens to ra se money for the purpose
of deposite with, or distribution among, the States?
A most opportune period, indeed, now, to raise
nine millions of dollars for thi  purpose' Now,
when >ou are telling u , almost in the same breath
in «h ch you pat forth this strange claim in favor
of the S dies, that, without additional taxation, you
w 11 not have reverue enough, for years to come,
to keep the whee s of Go\ ernment in motion. This
charge is scarcely deserving of a moment's atten-
t on He (Mr V ) would like to see how many
sentlemen up n tbi-s floor w<uld dire to vote lo
tax their tons ituento §9,000 000 tor the purpose of
deposite w th th.e Statis Low as was the estima-
tion in which he knew his colleague to hold the
\utue of Grvernmcntal economy, he did not be-
lieve that even he would deem it exped ent to vote
for a di.ect propo mon to impose new taxes on the
people, solely «i h a vie v to ouch deposite or dis-
tiionuon Ihe States have no equitable claim to
it They were to be made the mere depos taries of
the funds of this Government, not professedly for
th° benefit of the States, but for the mere convex
venience of the dppos tor The supervenient wants
of the latter had induced it to withhold a portion of
the fund which it originally intended to deposite It
had a perfect right to do so, and now no equity
whatever has been created in behalf of the States
against this Government for the sum so withheld
This i em needed no fuither comment merely to
state it, was sufficient to prove its absurdity
But the next item was equal to its yokefellow.
It was "for claims of Amerxan citiz ns for French
spol at ons on oui commerce prevuus to 1800,
(quite likely to be allowed by Congres*,) $5,000,-
000'" Mr V said he did not know whence his
cólica'ue inferred a likelihood that these claims
would be allowed, except what resulted from the
kno xn prod galitv of ihe paity to which the Go-
vernment was now so soon to be commuted Was
<-u"h pr babili y d nvable, from the fact that for
ei ht jears this claim had been unsuccessfully
pres ed upon C mgres , and that scarcely a voice
had ever bt on heard here in its favor, except the
e oqjent ard meiodioas oi e of the pertleman from
Massachusetts, [%lr Clshim, ] Wnen the leading
grille men of the dominant party inform us that
sf ccisl Congresses must be called lo provide means
to mee sU h claims, Inve we not reason to think
that oar most ex ravagart feus in relation to the
fiuits of the la e Federal Whig victory are soon to
be realized—that extravaganc , taxation, a formi-
dable nat i nal debt, ¿nd a consequent restoration of
tbe H«milli.m?n ftnamonger and B?nk reign, are
the bltssinss wmch are to be showered down upon
the people? It th  c'aimanf- for spoliations before
1800 are now lo be provided for are we, from this
c rcumstance, an^1 f ri m the denunciations con-
«Unil> l-visb d i pon the outgoing Administration
for its r egret of pnva e clai ns, to infer that the
r°Tt four yea s u to be the tme of jubdee to pri-
vate ckim-ints? that millions of ul -rejected claims
are now to receive from C ngress a favorable re-
spors i that the Meade claim, and the countless
cual^gue of other oh cens dered and as often re-
jee'ed claims, are ro * t > be allowed? that by car-
rying into execution your magnificent and extrava-
gant schemes, yoa p>-e not only to invite the people
rt large, by >ei7 rg upon tneir own effects through
tne medium of i out taxing power, but are to pour
wealth pnd bount/ into the lap of thousands of in-
dividuals Yvhora your more cautions and parsimo-
nious p edece son adjudged to have no just claims
upon Government' Mr V said he would now put
n t3 a 1 fiu and unorcjudiecd minds whether state-
nen s sUCa as he h-id reviewed, furmshed the
sli 'h est groun' fur impeaching the accuracy ot the
Secretary of the Tressur), or the shadow of a pre-
text for call ng an cxira eosion, for the purpose of
providing for chdigc^ agamst the Treasury, which
the Secretary had neglected to make known? Did
it not turn out that the statements and allegations
