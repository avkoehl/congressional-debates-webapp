1858.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2419
hours, and give to the public business that sort of
consideration which has been given to the bills
that have been before us this evening. I there-
fore move that the committee rise.
The motion was not agreed to.
The Clerk then proceeded to read the bill by
sections, for amendment.
Mr. LETCHER. I move to amend the sec-
ond section of the bill by striking out the words
" that if the revenues of the Post Office Depart-
ment shall be insufficient to meet the appropria-
tions of this act," and inserting "in lieu thereof:
That aa the revenue of the Post Office Department will
be insufficient to meet the appropuations of this act, the
thiee-cent rate of postage is hereby increased to five cents,
to take effect on the 1st day of August next, and in case
there shall be a deficiency."
So that it will read:
Slc.2. Jlnd be it further en acted, Til at as the revenue of
the Post Office Department will be insufficient to meet the
appropriations of tins act, the three-cent rate of po-tage is
hereby mcicased to five cent?, to take effect on the fust day
of August next, and in cane there shall be a deficiency, then
the sum of §3,500.000, or so much theieof as may be neces-
sary, be, and the same is hereby, appiopnated, to be paid
out of any money in the Tieasury not otherwise appropri-
ated, to supply deficiencies in the revenue of the Post Office
Department for the year ending the 30th of June, 1859.
Mr. ENGLISH. I raise a question of orderon
that; it proposes to change the existing law.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks that the
amendment is not in order.
Mr. LETCHER. I hope the Chair will allow
rne to state why I think it is m order.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will be very
happy to hear the gentleman.
Mr. LETCHER. This bill is to provide the
means for defraying the expenses of the Post
Office Department; and my amendment is strictly
within the meaning of the object of the bill as ex-
pressed in the title. My amendment is to provide
the means for that purpose; and it strikes me it is
strictly in order.
Mr. LOVEJOY. Will the gentleman allow me
to oiler an amendment to his amendment?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is compelled
to rule the amendment out of orderon the ground
that it proposes to change existing laws.
Mr. LETCHER. Does not this other proposi-
tion for borrowing money for defraying the ex-
penses of that Department propose to chango ex-
isting laws? The Post Office Department was
organized to be a self-sustaining machine.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is of opinion
that the amendment of the gentleman is in con-
flict with the 81st rule, which provides that no
amendment shall be in order to a general appro-
priation bill, which is not in accordance with ex-
isting laws. The propriety of the original pro-
visions in the bill is not a question which is now
before the Chair for decision.
Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. This debate is not
in order; and I object to it unless the gentleman
takes an appeal.
Mr. LETCHER. I do take an appeal if the
Chair decides that an amendment for raising rev-
enue to meet the expenses of the Post Oilice De-
partment is not in order.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair decides that
the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia
changes the existing law; and, therefore, is not in
order under the 81st rule.
Mr. LETCHER. From that decision I appeal.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will state the
ground of his decision. He regards this as a bill
appropriating the revenue of the Post Office De-
partment as now provided by law. The amend-
ment of the gentleman from Virginia proposes to
change the law for raising revenue, and is there-
fore clearly in conflict with the 81st rule.
Mr. LETCHER. The Chair will pardon me.
He does not state the fact correctly.
Mr. J". GLANCY JONES. Is the appeal de-
batable ?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks not.
Mr. LETCHER. I do not mean to debate it.
I only want to correct the statement of the Chair.
The Chair stated that this was a bill appropriat-
ing the revenues of the Post Office Department.
This section docs not appropriate the revenues
of the Post Office Department, but is to supply
revenue from other sources.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. Does not the
amendment of the gentleman change the law es-
tablishing the rates of postage *
Mr. LETCHER. Yes, sir: and so does every
1 deficiency bill, which you have passed, change
| the law.
! Mr. COBB. Will the gentleman permit me to
insert another provision in his amendment, abol-
ishing the franking privilege?
Mr. LETCHER. I have no objection to that.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will simply
read the title of the bill, which indicates its char-
acter. It is "A bill making appropriations for
the service of the Post Office Department for the
year ending the 30th of June, 1859." The effect
of the amendment is to change the law establish-
ingexisting rates of postage, and upon that ground
the Chair decides it to be in conflict with the
rule, and out of order.
Mr. LETCHER. Well, sir, I withdraw my
appeal; and now I will give my views upon the
proposition, as there is no means of stopping de-
bate here now.
The CHAIRMAN. If there be no amendment
offered the bill will be laid aside.
Mr. LETCHER. No, sir; I have the flo:
upon this bill, and I desire to explain the leasons
why I have submitted this proposition. We have
heard here, for weeks past, about the War De-
partment and the Navy Department of the Gov-
ernment swallowing up the entire revenue of the
country for purposes that are unnecessary. Now,
sir, here comes this Post Office Department, about
which little or nothing has been said, for which
we last year made an appropriation of $2,500,000
to supply a deficiency for the year ending 30th of
June, 1853, and during the present session wc
appropriated $1,469,000 for supplying a still fui-
ther deficiency for the same year. Then, so far as
this present year is concerned, the revenues of
the Post Office Department, which way intended
as a self-sustaining machine, falls short, by the
amount of $3,969,000, of paying its current ex-
penses.
Now, sir, for the next fiscal year the expenses
of the Post Office Department are estimated at a
little upwards of fifteen million dollars; and in
this very section which I propose to amend, is an
appropriation of §3,500,000, for the purpose of
meeting anticipated deficiencies in the revenues of
that Department. I have said that the intention
was, in establishing this Department, to make it
support itself. This bill proposes to provide other
means, derived from other sourccs, to apply to
the service of that Department, to the exclusion
of other legitimate objects; and it does seem to me
that, if ever there was a proposition coming within
the limits prescribed by the rules of the House,
which it would be in order to consider in connec-
tion with this bill, it is this very proposition,
ent ./ I have no idea whether this increase of letter-
postage rates that I have proposed would make up
)5r the amount necessary to cover the entire estimated
deficiency for the year ending 30th June, 1859.
But I have no doubt it would go a very consider-
able extent towards accomplishing that result;
and instead of having to supply such a sum as is
here named, or such a sum as has been supplied
during the present year, we may reduce it down
to one third or one fourth the sum here asked for.
Now, sir, having given my reasons for the
course I have pursued, I am content.
Mr. J. GLANCY JONES. I do not intend to
make a speech, because I do not think it worth
while; but, sir, I have in my hands statistics
which I would like to send to the Clerk's desk and
have road, to go along with the speech of my
friend from Virginia. They are the following:
