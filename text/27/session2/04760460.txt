w$h as much satisfaction as ha ever felt m giving a vote upon
Mr. WRIGHT observed that the Senator from Pennsylvania
bad made an explanation which was properly due from hira
(Mr W ) He had never heard the question raised until about
a year ago, of granting sa'atiea 10 consulsas consuls He would
reiatealutleof oigexpetieni-e When he was a member of the
Committee 01 Foreign Affairs, he a-certamed tha . they were
paying salaries to two ol their consuls at the most important
placet, while not a dollar in. the way of salary waa paid to any
other, a large portion of whom were literally starving He sug
gested the propriety of the two salaries being withdrawn, but
was told that it cpuld not be done, especially as regarded the
one at Pans, because, at that time, the claims under the treaty
negotiated by the ¡senator from Virginia were not closed
From that time the raatter had bpen peimitted to ies$—at least
he had heard nothing upon the subject, and he believed the
Senate had neverbeen called upon until new to declare whether
a consul should, as consul, receive a salary
Mr. WOODBURY showed that in 11*35 and '36 the ap-
Í>ropriations and estimates were ail "for agents for claims," and
t was not till 1837 the change was made to the present
wording, because the claims requiring the agencies had
ceased
Mr KING explained how the change had taken place with
regard to the consul at London, who had shown that the office
could not be sustained without the allowance
Mr RIVES observed, that in 1837 the question wiasolemnlv
decided that these consuls should receive this salary as con
sul$, and nolonger as agents for claims It was well known
then, that ihey had no agency in le^aid to tht, prosecution ol
claims All of that branch of business for the last twen y
years had gone into the hand^ of the political diplomatic body
representing this Government at those places

So the amendment was rejected
The next amendment was—page £9, line 682, to stiike out
"thirty five," and insert f<í¡ty," being an inn ease of $ 15,000
to the sum appropriated by the House fur the relief and pruttc
uon of \meiican seamen in foreign countries
Mr EVANS cxp'amed the object of this amendment, which
was. to provide a sufficiency to pievent the protest of consulate
drafts in future
The amendment was adopted
The amendments pr>po=?ed by the Committep on Fmarce hav-
ing all been disposed of,
Mr EVAN  moved an additional amen lment in come in
after the 6tlth tin*', being an appiopmtion oj SI 000 for ihe
expe se of removing hesatueol Washington m the rotundo
The amendmen' was adopted
Also, anjther amendment aftei sime line, being $2000 for
expenses incident to tht. issuing of Tieasmy notes here ofore

shall be applied, and no compensation shall ba mad> to my of
ficerof (he Unittd States whose sdaiy is established by law,
for piep inn.;, signing or retting, Tteasury notes
Mr KING wished to know how tina expenso was incurred
for the issuing of fteasuiy notes'?
Mr. EVANSexplained, tl at on the first bill for the issue of
Treasury notej, the <xp rise of prepmng engraving, and
feigning note was provide I lor Ho lid not IHieve there was
any expenst-ofwignvingnow, but he baI eved the allowance
originally was for l prepon ig, engiivinj, and aig vug Ticas
ury notes," in the eai ly r triod of this Government The pne
tice had been to allow %l ¿Z fir «?i'mng 10) Tn o«ury n >tes
The words; rmng he conceiv ed hid been ma Ivertently draught
ed into the bill of 1837 out of the bills piuhor zing 'heboid
Tteasury no > 9 Ha did not think ihue should have teen iny
such allowance He believed the money alieady paid on that
account hid betn butweiii thr e and fotti thousand dollar
Mr SLV1CR. was glid to heir the -tmi 01 disappiove of the
practice He hoped he would fnlow üp this good dispo mm
witha proposition to stop the three or four thon=md dollars
thus paid, out of the salaries of theofficeis who had made the
chaige
Mr EVVN3 would not himself make that proposition, batit
was open to any other gi ntlcman
After a few more icmarks, chiefly m explanation from
Mesare EVa*^, SEVIER, and WOODBTJRV, the amend
meiK was ulopted
Mi KING would ref r the Senator fiom Mime to the 653d
line of the bill, "ft 1 c mpleting th  dike, (irom Goit Island,

Mr. EVANfe said there waenotüme to make the innronrt-
9Uoft then, as aU the appropriation bills had been passed, and
the books were not ordered till the very last day of the last ses-
sion of the twenty sixth Congress
Mr WOOIMiURY said the object of his proviso was to pre-
vent such a thing happemng again He did not now bring U
forward for the puipose of censuring the other House, but
merely to p) event heieafter any deficiency to be appropriated
for without authority of law    Heieadthe proviso to that ef-
Mr WRIGHT lemar^ed that it appeared, ftom what had
fallen from the chairman of the Finite Committee, [Mi
Evans ] that 117 sets of books, or thereabouts, were purchased
under the simple resolution passed a* the last hour of the last
session of the last Consreos, ior which an ex* ense was incurred
ofsomeébOOOO as neai as he (Mr W ) could compute the
amount Thib gave to each membei, (if the number were equal
to the sets charged for,) at the expense of the Government,
books which cost $500, rather over thaa under thatanount
He recollected and recapitulated the circumstances attending
the refusal by the Senate at past Congresses, and particularly
at the last session of the last Congress, to sanction the dit>trtbu
tion of books t> members at the expense of the people At the
last Congress the proposition, aftei the pnctice had been dis-
continued, was luiewed and 1 piuposmon came horn the
House, in the civil and diplomatic bill, forcing upon the Senite
books as a condition for appropriating them to that House We
refused to e^feitam the piopoMtion The bill went back,
and the House adhered We came to a committee
of confoience, and the íesult was, a compromise on
the part oí the Senate cheerfully to pay for the
books foi th^House, and reí using that any poition of them
should b ám fed to the foenate Iht, understands: was then
distinct between the two bodies t1 at that was to end the prsc
tice. He had nov understood, m the dchbeiitions of the last
Congress, tudt (hepracice woul 1 occur again But it setras
the iiousp rover ly Mimed lie nra"tire, ind mcurted a neavy
expenditure He believed it wa" the duty of the Senate toie
fuse to put an appiopna'ion in thh. bill tocove^it and make
tht. legislation upon the oiibj^ctdiatinctjand independent, and as
an independent law, and let the people see that this large
amount called for was to give to memberoof the other branch
of Congie&f, in bo >k$ to each costing $503 He was willing to
let the House take the books themselves, and the responsibiiK?
attending the act but he wi'i unwilling to have the necessity
forced on the ¡senate of making provision to pay forthem,and
thus shatc the responsibility of the act He, therefore, made
the motion to stnke out the sppiopuation, with the view of
having it provided for in an independent act

Mr WRIGHT saiá, if the motion to go into executive session
was intended to be pressed, before taking the question he d«-
sJred to submit an amendment, for the purpose of having it
printed, which he intended to offer aftet the bill was reported to
the Senate The amendment was of a complicated character,
and authorized the distuct attorneys, and clerks of district
courts, and clerks of circuit courts, and marshals ol the United
Sutes, to make to the Secietary of the Treasury periodical re-
turns, m wri'ing, of all fees and emoluments of their respective
offices, distinguishing those payable on (he bankrupt law It
also prescribes the allowance to those officers for certain ser-
vices, &e                                  „  ,               ,                      ,     _

The question was then put on the motion lo go into executive
session, and disagreed to, bj—ayes 13, noes 16
Mr TAPPAN made some remarks condemnatory of the prac-
tice of voting money for books, and particularly of the course
ot the House, on ifs own responsibility, of incurring an enor-
mous expense for Dookd to be divided among themselves, and
then calling upon the Senate to make anappropnat on covermg
the expense
Mr BUCHANAN would vo e m favor of the motion to

A bill foi the relief of Hazard Knowles, also, a bill forthe re-

Mr ADAMS asked the general consent of the House to pre-

othei residents of M?esachusetrs, m relation 10 a protective
tar fF The memorial was signed, amongst otheis, by a late
Representative in this House, and perhaps, by some persons
who were connected with manufactures at Lowell He asked

p inted with the names of me petitioners,—[Mr Hopkins I
object]—and refened to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, to whom tha report of th  chairman of the
Committee on Manufacturtahad already been refeired, and, m
making this motion, he wished '0 state a few reasons for ask-
ing this permission of the House
Mt HOPKINS was understood again to object, because this
was private bill day
Mi AD\Maiaidhe asked this permisión, fiist, from per-
sonal considerations next, for considerations relating to his
colleagues on this floo), and, fuither, 'bi considerations affect

one of the commissioners appointed to investigate the concerns
of the New York custom hou^e He lepeated that he isked
this permission because his own personal character was in
volv d in it, and the tnaiac'ei c f eveiy one of his colleagues
on this floor, of whom he regretted so small a poruon were then
under hs eve, he regretted it because he wished to call their
attention, as well as the attent on of the Hou«e ind of the na-

Mr HOPKINS- said he withdrew the obiection which he had
made
Mr WBE remarked that it wis proper the ge-itleman from
Massachusetts shou'd explain, because the report to which he

Mr ADAMS admitted that he yesterday voted against a re-
ror-ideiation because ht hoped tne rer rt would be printed

of the debate j esterd iy on that subject, certain remarks were
made by the ffentlrman *iom Vjrgima, [Mi Wise ] which he

it called not only on him and on his cüMen ups hut ateo on the

política'engine not only an anti ariffeigme, but to blot the
character of many of the mo«t re«pec'ab)e citizens of this
Union from the fctate of Massachusetts, dX\d he hoped such of
hiscolleaguesasmahtnotbe present then would see the sub-
stance of that charge, as it was reported in the papers of this
morning It waj to be an ant 1 tariff* engine, it was to put down
every thing in this Hius- and elsewhere, m favor of a protec-
tive tariff, and it was to call upon the State of South Cajolma
