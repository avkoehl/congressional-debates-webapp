Comrmuee on í manee
Mr WEBSlERsaidit was not to besupposed
that t.ns sutiect had escaped the attention of that

coins This subject was before theotner House,

Yoik in that body Mr W hopeu ti e honorable
membei from New York [Mi Wpight] would
use wnat exertions he could to indace a speedy
action on the bill in the House oí Re[ lesentatives
Mi WRIGHT said he was awaie that the
sulject was before the other House Tríese
memorialists had connected distinct piopositions
in reference to the gold and silvei coin, and tl ey
had done so because tney were appienensive that
the measure befoie the House m ght not pass, and
they believed their propositions were presented in
a more simple form Mr W said tins, that the

leceive, the respectful attention of the Committee

Mr HENDRICKS presented a memorial from
citizens of Swiizeiland county, State of Indiana,
piaying that the depositps may be restoied to the
Bank of the United States, and that that institution
may be rechaitered
Mi. U said th"t the memorial wasnumeiously
signed by all political parties, and by men of
every puisuitand occupation in life, that this was
'a "ounty in which the friends of the present Chief
Mag strate were numeious an 1 'he party strong,
bat that ip this n stance all othei considerations
hed been buried in oblivion, and this bubject taken
up because the people felt what they said, that
this memorial was not to be viewed as apaity
pioduct on, but as the expiession of an honest,
inteh gent people, truly lepiesenting the condition
of then county, the causes which had produced
it, and the remedy in their opinion, propel to be
adopted This county (said Mr II.) is situated
on the Ohio river above the falls It is of the
second class of counties in size and population,
but in the peaceful industry, die vntue, and mtel
ligence of its population, it is second to none It
is a mixed population, giouped together from
every quaitei of the Union, and from almost eveiy
quartei of the world,chiefly, however, from Ken-
tucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania,New York, and New
England I his county, too, contains the Swiss
settlement emig ants fiom the cantons of Switzer-
land,m Euiope, who,atan early period, sett'ed on
the Ohn nvei, wheie they sti'l live, and where
they have long been successfully engaged in tht
cu'tuie of the vine
Mi Ii said th_t the parsuits of this people
weie mainly agncultuial, that they were the
exportéis as well as the gtovus of their pioduce,
their market was New O leans, to which they
carried a heavy expoit tiade every yeei They
had as little duect n teiest in the BanK of the Jni-
ted States as any people of the Union, they dealt
not in stocks or m banks, they seek not accom-
modations in banks, but in the piospeiuy of the
Bank of the United States th y had a deep interest,
for having no State banks as yet in operation, the
paper of that bank had laigely entered into the
enculating medium of that section of thecountiy
The present state of things had withdrawn rapidly
from circulation the paper of that bank, and its
place was but pai'ially supphed with the paper of
otbei bal k¡>, in which the people had less confi-
dence than in the Bank of the United States
The people of Swuzei'and county (said Mi
II ) tell you that past experience demonstrates the
convenience and necessity of a papei cnculatmg
med uni, conveitib'e imo sptcie, to supply the
wint of suffi i nt metallic cunemy 1 hey be
heve tnat a s 'fhcient quanti'v of go,d and silver
does not e*i«t to foi m a cuculiting medium, and
that a sudden change, ci aaemot et change,cou'd
not fail to Jiostrate the b°s' interests of the coun-
try They believe that the country cannot get
alongwithout a national bank of some kind, that
without such institution, the curiency cannot have
either soundness or stability, nor can the exchanges
of the country be equalized or regulated And in
these opinions Mr H entirely concurred He
believed we could rotget a'ong witnout a national
bank, oi a national curiency He said he was no
advocate foi the present bank, and believed it had
no paramount claim for a recharter, he would prefer
a new bank, one located in the city of Washing-
ton He knew there weiemany objections to this
lo ation, but they were not msuimountable By
this location, the constitutional difficulty would be
done away, for ah admit the power of Congiess to
charter a bank help He would not chartei so
large a cap tal as ^35,000,000, foi if, as so often
alleged, the present bank had exercised too much
powei, and become dangerous, it was on account
of l's great capital He would dis'ribute tne bonus
among the States, and would permit it to locate
blanches in the States, only by peimission of the
State Legis'atures, nor would he depuve Congiess
of the power, at a future day, if the public inter-
ests should i equire, of modifying such chartei, or
of chartering another bank Such bank,although
it could not go into operation till the expiration of
the present i hartei, would give prospective sta-
bility to the cuirency, would at once insane tonfi
dence, and4hat was all tnat was wanting
Mi H said that no one regretted the removal
of the deposites more than himself It was an
unfoitunate measure foi the countiy He had
never doubted the power to íemove them, nor the
correctness of the motive whi<-h had induced the
removal, but he had always "regretted the measure
as deleteuous and irjudic ous He had said by
his vote, that the leasons of the Secretary were
unsatisfactory and insufficient, but he had care-
fully avoided any vote, or any act, hav <vg a tend-
ency to increase excitement, whicn, lnhisopinion,
was but increasing the distress complained of
He had voted against every measuie having a tend-
ency to prolong or embitter the deep agitation of
the country His ooject was the tranquillity of
the country, at this time too much disturbed, the
prosperity of the  countiy, which could  not be
restoied unless the excitement be allayed
Mr H moved that the memorial be read, print-
ed, and lefened to the Committee on Finance.
Mr B ENTON said he would add his testimony,
if necessaiy, to that of the Senator fiom Indiana,
[Ml Hendkicks,] m favor of the respectability of
the population which furnished the subscribers to
the memoual just presented He knew their
industry, enterprise, and sincere devotion to their
countiy, and had no doubt but that they fully-
believed in all the distresses which they mentioned;
but then petitions only recited what had been al-
leged on this floor for the last four or five months-,
and the i eason why petitions were so late in coming
fiom thatd.stance must be because the petitioners
were so fa off from the source of alai m, so faroff
from this Chamber, where the cry of distiess was
first íaisedfoui orfive months ago The petition-
ee speak of the scarcity of money in consequence
of the disappearance of the! United States Bank
notes Now, (said Mr B ,) the petitioners doubt-
jl less thought there had been a great diminution of
this kind of currency, because they heard it pro-
claimed from all quarters But he (Mr. B ) would
ask the Senator from Indiana himself, [Mr Hen-
dricks,] what was the real amount of these notes
wnhdiawn from circulation'
Mr HEN DRICKS said, that he had not before
him any statistical tables, showing him the con-
dition of the Bank of the United States, neither
monthly íeports nor those of any other period, and
h s recollection did notfuinish him with an answer
to the question p-opounded He presumed the
Senator from Missouri was much more familiar
with that subject than himself Nor did.it go to
the point in question, whatevei the facts might be.
He piesented the memorial of a portion of his con-
stituents, men of intelligence, who well understood
the fact which they stated to the Senate What
was that fact? The want of an adequate circulating
medium, and the rapid disappearing of the United
States Bank paper in that section of the country
This is a' fact intimately connected with their
business—a fact which they see and feel They
make no statement of this kind for any other por-
tion of the country, but undertake to represent the
condition of their own. Now, to them it makes
little difference how much or how little may be
tne amount of notes withdrawn from circulation
by the Bank of the United States It is the effect
of the existing derangement of the currency upon
themselves of which they complain
Mi BENTON resumed It was right to be a
littfc statistical in this case The statistics would
shpw that, ir point of fact, there was veiy little
diminution of the Circulation of the United States
Btnk notes There was about sixteen or seven-
teen millions of those notes now out, and that
lacked but little of the quantity outlast year before
the deposites weie removed, and which was usu-
ally about seventeen or eighteen millions. Still
the petitioners were no doubt right in thefactthat
these notes were scarce m tne pait ofHhe countiy
in which they lived, for the law of bank circula-
tion, which he (Mi B ) explained on another
occasion, earned them off to the Northeast
Mi B spoke of the prices of produce in New
Oi leans, and quoted from Benjamin Levy's Price
Current, of tne most recent date Trom this, it
appealed that western pioduce bore a good price;
citton highei than it was at this time last year;
poik, beel, bacon, flour, corn,&c , about as high as
u?ual, and in good demand He also read aletter
from Cincinnati, showing that steamboat business,
both freight and passage, was better than it had.
been for three yeaisonst, that money was as plen-
tiful as usual, prices as good as usual, people con-
tented as usual, and panic makers only outofbusi-
ness Mi B then took up a New York paper,
the Times, just received, and which gave the value
of different bank notes at the broker's board in
that city, and showed that the southern banks had
neany recoveied ihetr ancient rates in that market.
The Carolina banks only about three per cent.
