THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 11,
yet the bank would not be bound to take upon
itself that duty, unless it was required of it by act
of Congress Por it is not enough that new pen
sions are created—there must also be some law
directing the bank to act as agent m paying them,
otherwise the bank can be nothing more than a
voluntary agent, and at liberty, therefore, to sur-
render their Must whenever they think proper
But there is no pretence that the law or resolu
tion of 1832 contains any direction that the bank
should act as agent in paying these claims There
is no reference in the law to any foimer act of
Congress from which such an intention can be in-
ferred, even by the most strained and forced con-
struction, and, therefore, if these payments be
considered pensions, in the legal sense in which
the word is used in the acts of Congress, yet the
duty of paying them has not been imposed on the
bank, and they were not bound to perform the
duty, unless they supposed it to be then interest
to do so.
There is another point of view in which the sub-
ject presents itself, and which it is believed is still
more important, and that is the attitude assumed
by the bank They do not claim the books, pa-
pers, and funds, as belonging to them These are
confessedly the property of the Government
But they claim the right to retain the possession
of them, not from an y interest winch they have in
them, foi this is disavowed, but merely that they
may take care that thelaws be faithfully executed
This is certainly a novel ptetension, ard it is be-
lieved is now for the fiist time asseited by a coi
poration, at least in the United S'ates By the
Constitution, the execution of the laws is confided
to the Executive
The allegation of the bank, as contained in the
letter of the president of the bank of January 23,
1834, that" it is no justification to the bank to
obey any othei authority," (than Congiess,) "for
' if it pays money oi transfrrs money, without the
' authority of Congress, its accounts may be dis
' allowed by the accounting officers," does not, in
the opinion of the committee, deserve to be ser -
ously considered oi refuted. His impossible to
conceive upon what grounds such an apprehension
as is hete pretended could besenously entertained,
ioi whatever authority the bank had to disburse
the annuities undei the act of June 7th, 1832, was
derived, not from Congie^s, foi the act dntcis the
payment  to be made "inula the diectwnij the
Seeictanj," butftom their appointment as paying
agent, by the Secret iry of Whi , and if he g tve
the authority, it would be strange, indeed, if he
could not revoke it The public money had been
placed in the hands of the bank, by oidei of the
Secretary of Wai, and if he ¡evokes that oider,
and dnects the money to be returned to the tieas,
ury, or transfeired to othei agents, it is absurd to
Buppose that the bank, by obeying, should be in
any way embairassed in the settlement of their
accounts There was not theslightestgiound for
such a belief, and it cannot, therefore, be uiged
ns any extenuation or apology for the course of
the bank
In no view of the subject can tbe bank, m the
opinion of the committee, rightfully retain posses-
sion of the money and propeity of the Govern-
ment If the law of 1832 had constituted the bank
(which the committee do not concede, but, on the
contraiy, maintain u did not) the paymgagent of
the Government, it would not necessarily follow
that they must keep possession of these books,
papéis, and funda Many cases might be con-
ceived in which it would be not only j toper, but
the duty, of the Government to resume tne pos
tension of them The books and papéis mignt be
wan eil for copying, examination, or corree ion,
or other conceivable purposes The money appro-
priated foi these payments might be accumulated
in an unnecessaiy degree a* a given point, and
might be wanted elsewhere, m consequence of a
diminished supply at other "places " designated
by the Secretaiy foi the payments But the
ground taken by the bank excludes all possibility
of the ex°icise of this supeivisory regulation of
the head of the depiitmen , wnose duty the law
makes it to see that the "pay " allowed by the act
shall be mad  under his "duectwn " and at such
" times " and "places " as he may designate The
1 a ik, in effect, sayc w  have decided that we are
tae proper agents to make the payments, and thti e-
fore the Government shall in no tase have any
power to withdraw thepioperty which it has here-
tofore placed in our possession Such a principle,
if applied to all other cases of disbursing officers
who may assume the ground that they have been 
illegally dealt with, would lead to consequences
which do not requne to be stated, and could not,
for a moment, be tolerated.
If the bank when the demand was made for the
books, papers, and money of the Government in
its possession had "protested," if they thought
the demand illegal, and bad then delivered them
up, and had afterwards appealed to Congress or
the judicial tribunals for such redress or decision
as the nature of the case might call for, then
position would have been far different from what
it is now Assuming to decide the law for them-
selves, and auogating the power to see that the
laws be faithfully executed, they assume a power
heretofore unknown to our laws and institutions
Claiming to define their own legal rights, they
have so tar forgotten the rights of the public as to
withhold vouchers and funda to which they can
have no title.
It further appears to the committee that the
change directed to be made by the Secretary of
Wai was called for by the circumstances. It is
understood that the change has been confined toa
substitution of the local banks of deposite for the
Bank of the United S'ates and its branches at those
places wheie local banks or deposites have been
selected Where the public funds are yet depos
ited in the branches of the United States Bank,
these blanches are yet the agents foi malting the
payments, by appointment of the Secretary of
Wai, undei the act of June 7, 1832 Where the
change has been made, the business is to be done
by the new agency without any charge whatever
to the Government
The reason and propriety, therefore, of the
measure, are obvious The.object is to direct the
banks holding the public money to pay out this
money to persons claiming it under the act of
Tune 7, 1832, instead of having the funds diawn
fiom these banks and placed in the United States
Bank and its branches, for the mere purpose of
doing what the foimeP may do as well To have
continued the agency of the Bank of the United
States in making these payments, when the pub-
lic moneys weie in other banks, would have
been unnecessarily to put it in the power of the
Bank of the United States, by means of the public
funds, to draw large amounts of specie fiom time
to time fiom the selected banks, to hoard in its
own vaults, theieby to increase for its own pui-
poses, a needless and unjustifiable pressure on the
people
It remains to be considered what effect this un-
wanantable act of the bank may have upon the
futuie payments to be made to the officers and sol-
diei s emu'ed to tbe benefits of the provisions of the
act of 1332 The committee called upon the Secre-
tary of War for in formation on this point, and her e-
with submit the answer which has been received.
It appeals that on the 1st of January last, the bank,
as disbursing agent for the payment of claims
under the act of June 7th, 1832, held of public
moneys diawn fiom the Treasury for this object,
the sum of $470,540 98 Since then, other pay
ments, to acompaiatively small amount, may have
been made, and it is possible that subsequent set
dements may fui th r reduce this balance This sum
had been regulaily diawn fiom the Treasury by
wai rants in the usual way, and placed in the pos
ses ion of the bank to be disbursed The act of
18P makes a standing appropriation of the amount
necessary to cirry its provisions into effect The
bmk, by withholding the sum which it has in
possess'on, stands in the situation of any other
defaulting disbursingagent, and a sum equal to that
which it thus wiongfully retains, must be drawn
fiom the Tieasury and applied to the pavments
until the amount withheld by it shall berecóveied
The detention of the books and papers by the
bank, will not necessarily postpone the payments
until the possession of such books and papers may
be recovered from the bank, but it will render it
necessiry for the Department of War to make
out new lists of th >se entitled to pay, and there is
ro piobabihty that this can be done sufficiently
eai ly to enable the pnyments under the act of June
7, 1832, to be made on the 4th of Match next,
especially at the distant agencies, agreeably to the
established usage. The labor of preparing new
lists and papers is understood to be great, and
with all the care that can be taker, there will be
a liability to error, in many cases, until the present
agents settle their account, resulting from the
uncertainty of the periods to which the payments
may have been made But as no surviving claim-
ants have been paid to a period later than the 4th
of September last, all who are now living may be
paid on the 4th of March for the half year ending
at that time.
If any inconvenience should be felt by any of
those veterans of the Revolution, as the committee
believe it will be by all, by the delay which will
take place in the payment of the next annuity due
to them, it is to be attributed to the unjustifiable
conduct of the bank in interposing to thwart the
views of the Government, in withholding from the
officers of Government the public money and pub-
lic property, to which they do not pretend to have
any claim The committee cannot condemn, in
terms too strong, the conduct of the bank in this
transaction The bank withholds fiom the pub-
lic service the large sum of four hundred and sev-
enty thousand five hundred and forty-six dollars
and ninety-eight cents, and thus puts the Govern-
ment to the inconvenience of applying other funds
to the objects for which the sum they retain was
appropnated and drawn from the Tieasury.
So far as respects thedehvery ofthe public prop-
erty m their possession, they refuse to obey the
instructions issued, but so far as respects the ter-
mination of the duty of making payments, they
yield a ready acquiescence, and yet there is the
same authority for the one order as for the other.
Bunn the former case, they have a duect pecu-
niary inteiest in the couise they pursue. In the
latter, their interest is not at stake, and no one
suffers but the Government, which must advance
other funds to supply the place of those illegally
retained by the bank, and the veterans of the Rev-
olution, who must wait for the amount due them
until the necessary documents can be prepared to
justify the payment.
The existing laws are, in the opinion of the com-
mittee, adequate to enable the Goveinment to
effect a recovery from the bank of its money and
property, and therefore they propose no measure
of legisla'ion in this respect. Neither is any fur-
ther appropriation required to supply the place of
the sum thus retained by the bank, foi, as has
been aheady remarked, the act of June 7, 1832,
makes a standing appropnation of the sums ne-
cessary to carry its provisions into effect If the
bank, or any other disbursing agent for the pay-
ment of theije claims, become defaulters, and re-
fuse to pay ovei the public moneys placed in their
hands to make such payments, the mentoiious
class of citizens provided for by the act, cannot,
on thataccount,be deprived of theirnghts, though
some of them may experience delay in receiving
the sums due to them, as in this case they probably
will, in consequence of the conduct of the bank,
in withholding the public books and papers, by
which the exact amount of their claims is to be
ascertained
The committee deem the course of the bank
such in this case as to justify the repeal of the
several provisions constituting them pension
agents, under the invalid acts and the acts of 1818
and 1821) Theie seems to be no propriety in the
separation of these duties, but as one may be con-
veniently performed by the agents selected by the
Seci etary of War, so may the other. Thei e seems
to be a propriety, too, m confiding to a responsible
officer of the Government the duty of making
these payments, tather than leave it in the hands
of an íriesponsiole corporation They th refore
recommend this course, and report a bill accord-
ingly.
On motion of Mr POLK, the bill and report
were ordeied to be printed
Mr BLAIR, of South Carolina, said that the
subject was one of high interest to the public, and
he moved a suspension of the rule, to allow him
to move the printing of an extra number of copies
The motion was agreed to, and Mr BLAIR
moved that 10,000 copies of the report and accom-
panying documents be printed
The SPEAKER stated the motion must heone
day before it could be considered
