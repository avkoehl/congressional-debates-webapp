We have possession of New Kent Court-House, Cumberland, and White House. My troops are closing well up to-day and drawing supplies from Eltham. Reconnaissances are being pushed. One of our parties of cavalry was within six miles of Bottom's Bridge yesterday. I am very glad to hear that we have Norfolk. Nothing from [the] Galena except that she is again afloat and has gone up the river.

Honorable P. H. WATSON:

Your glorious news has been received. As I predicted, Virginia is to be abandoned. I start to-morrow at 6 a. m. with a division of 10,000 men, equal to any in the United States, by Luray to Front Royal through Chester Gap to Warrenton. I get no reply to my telegraphs from General McDowell. I delayed thus long according to orders until the other division could take position at Strasburg.

I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from General McDowell, through General Wadsworth, I have extended my lines to Manasass, having detachments at that place. Thoroughfare Gap, Hay market, and the Plains there adjoining my already established line to Front Royal. Nothing has occurred to interrupt the quietness of the lines to-day.

Very respectfully,
