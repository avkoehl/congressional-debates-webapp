GENERAL: I have the honor to send you herewith a few of the letters captured in a rebel mail by our expedition to Tunica Bend.* There is little of importance in any of them. The following is a summary of what I have found in reading them, viz: From letter directed to Simsport, October 31, reported that articles are smuggled out of New Orleans; that negroes are dying fast, and coming back from the yanks as fast as they went. Mobile, November 2: Prepared for attack, but no prospect of one at present. Northern elections overwhelmingly Abolition. News encouraging. Mobile, October 19, 1863: Families cannot live at less than $40 to $50 per day on the plainest food; are going to Lumpkin, Ga., where they can live for one-fourth of what it costs at Mobile. Bragg whipped Rosecrans, taking 7,000 and killing and wounding 20,000 to 25,000 more; rebel loss, 1,700 to 1,800 killed, and 12,000 to 15,000 wounded and missing. Reported that Lee cleaned out the Yankees again in Virginia last Thursday. Mobile, October 19, 1863; Glory over Taylor, Kirby Smith &amp; Co. Everything is confident, hopeful, &c. Addressed to commander of C. S. steamer Cotton, at Shreveport. Richmond, October 31: Things awful high. (See price current inclosed. Boots, $250 per pair, &c.)

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,
