Your dispatch of to-day is received.

As soon as they relieve veterans, these will be assigned to the brigades that are smallest in the field.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I have yours and Mr. Spaulding's letters. Instead of ordering the commissaries to sell rations to lasses of plantations and negroes except as laborers and soldiers of the United States, I cannot do it, but on the contrary want that order absolutely and vigorously enforced. If we feed a mouth except soldiers on active duty we are lost. Refugees and negroes of all sorts and kinds not in military use must move to the rear of Nashville, or provide food in some way independent of the railroad.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel SAWYER,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Thomas is now at Ringgold; Schofield is near his left. Dodge's two divisions are here, and the Fifteenth Corps at Whiteside's. All will be up to-morrow. The cavalry is behindhand, but I hope I will be in time. It will not be long now till we all move on the enemy's works. The commissary here, Colonel Beckwith, needs a small negro force of say 250 to guard cattle. Ask Rousseau if he knows of any such that can be had. If so, order them here to report to Colonel Beckwith.

General THOMAS,

Ringgold, Ga.:

Would it not be well for me to order Garrard to march, after crossing the Tennessee at Bridgeport, across to La Fayette, via Trenton road Dug Gap, sending his wagons and artillery along with McPherson's train? What does cavalry operating with infantry want with artillery and wagons?

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
