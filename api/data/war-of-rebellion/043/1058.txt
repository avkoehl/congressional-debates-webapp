REPORT OF Major M. HENRY AVERY, TENTH NEW YORK CAVALRY.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH NEW YORK CAVALRY

ON PICKET, AUGUST 3, 1863.

SIR: I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REPORT THAT THE DETACHMENT, UNDER COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT SCEVA, HAS RETURNED, HAVING ENCOUNTERED A RECONNOITERING PARTY OF THE ENEMY, ABOUT 20 STRONG, THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILE THIS SIDE OF LITTLE WASHINGTON, WHO FIRED ON HIS ADVANCE GUARD, BUT WERE IMMEDIATELY CHARGED BY LIEUTENANT SCEVA, AND PURSUED ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES BEYOND W. [LITTLE WASHINGTON], TOWARD SPERRYVILLE, WHEN, HAVING CAPTURED 3 OF THEIR NUMBER, AND HIS HORSES BEING VERY MUCH JADED, HE HALTED, THREW OUT PICKETS, AND FELL BACK TO LITTLE WASHINGTON, REMAINING THERE ABOUT AN HOUR, WHEN HE RETURNED. LIEUTENANT SCEVA ALSO TOOK A PRISONER THIS SIDE OF LITTLE WASHINGTON, WHO REPRESENTS HIMSELF AS BEING A CONSCRIPT, MAKING HIS WAY INSIDE OF OUR LINES. THE NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER IN COMMAND OF THE PICKET PLACED BY LIEUTENANT SCEVA BEYOND THE TOWN REPORTS SEEING A DETACHMENT ABOUT 20 STRONG GOING FROM THE DIRECTION OF FLINT HILL TOWARD SPERRYVILLE. I SHALL SEND AN OFFICER AND 20 MEN A FEW MILES BEYOND GAINES' CROSS-ROADS, TOWARD EVENING, FOR THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING IN THE GOVERNMENT WAGONS AND MULES REPORTED TO BE THERE, AND ALSO TO PROCURE INFORMATION. THE PRISONERS REPORT FITZ. LEE IN COMMAND OF HIS OWN AND JENKINS' BRIGADE, AND THAT A RUMOR WAS CURRENT AMONG THEIR MEN THAT THEY WERE TO ATTACK US TO-MORROW OR NEXT DAY. FROM THEIR STATEMENTS IT APPEARS THAT THEIR PICKET LINE WAS ADVANCED IN THIS DIRECTION YESTERDAY, AS THE SEVENTEENTH VIRGINIA, TO WHICH THE PRISONERS BELONG, DID NOT RELIEVE ANY PICKETS, BUT MADE NEW POSTS NEAR LITTLE WASHINGTON. I HAVE MADE NO NEW DEPARTURE OF MY LINE.

I AM, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,M. HENRY AVERY,

MAJOR, COMMANDING.

Lieutenant JOHN B. MAITLAND,

ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL.
