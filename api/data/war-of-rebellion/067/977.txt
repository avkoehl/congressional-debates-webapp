May 9, we took the road at about 4 a.m., the Sixtieth Ohio preceding, and the Fiftieth Pennsylvania, First Michigan Sharpshooters, and Seventy-ninth New York following. At about 10 a.m. arrived in sight of the River Ny. Detached 30 men as skirmishers on the right of the road under Captain McCollum, while the Sixtieth Ohio advanced skirmishers on the left, the main body of the Twentieth Michigan supported the skirmishers at a distance of 150 yards; the skirmishers forced their way across the Ny, and we moved up nearly to the crest of the hill with slight opposition. This regiment was in reserve across the road in an old roadway and gully, the Fiftieth Pennsylvania, Sixtieth Ohio, and First Michigan Sharpshooters forming the first line, when the Sixtieth Ohio was forced back and the First Michigan Sharpshooters gave way. The Twentieth checked the advance of the enemy, and these regiments rallied upon our left. The Seventeenth Michigan dashed up the road, passing through our lines. We were ordered not to move forward, and assisted in driving back the enemy. The line being partly restored, the Twentieth went on the double-quick to the support of the Fiftieth Pennsylvania, forming upon their right. I should have stated that before the balance of the brigade came up I had sent Company I, Lieutenant C. A. Lounsberry, commanding, to occupy the position afterward occupied by the First Michigan Sharpshooters. When the First Sharpshooters resumed their position in line Lieutenant Lounsberry reported back to his regiment. Being upon the extreme right of the line, I deployed skirmishers 300 yards to my right, and occupied a large house in my front with a company of sharpshooters. The balance of the day was occupied in constructing breast-works.

May 10, the morning was occupied in strengthening our works. A strong and vigilant skirmish line was kept out. About 3 p.m. received orders to be ready to attack at 5 p.m.; made a preparations accordingly. At about 6 p.m., having thrown forward a strong skirmish line, supported by a second, the line advanced. Being the right, which was the pivot, this regiment did not move far. In this advance the undersigned received a wound, which kept him from the command until the early part of July. The command then devolved upon Major George C. Barnes, who fell mortally wounded in the charge of June 18 near this place. The following report is made by Major C. B. Grant, his successor:

May 12, the regiment participated in the attack upon the enemy's works at Spotsylvania Court-House, advancing over an open space between the belts of timber. The enemy getting upon our flank and in our rear under cover of the wood on our left-the troops on our left having given way-Major George C. Barnes, then commanding, moved the regiment by the left flank into the woods. Here we were met by a rebel brigade, returning from an ineffectual charge upon our batteries, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensued, by which we fought our way out of the woods and brought off our colors in safety and captured a few prisoners.

May 19, moved 2 miles to the left and constructed heavy breast-works, which we occupied until the 21st.

The following is a list* of casualties during the second epoch, among whom are several brave, intelligent, and valuable officers. During this period our losses amounted to about one-half our effective strength.
