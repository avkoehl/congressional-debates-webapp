Near Middletown, Va., June 29, 1862-8 a. m.

Major General JOHN POPE:

Some days ago I obtained permission from General Fremont to send an officer for the division I commanded to collect our knapsacks, tents, and baggage left at Petersburg; also to bring up the men left behind there and elsewhere, sick or broken down by hard marching. All will arrive to-day, adding much comfort and about 500 effective men to the command.
