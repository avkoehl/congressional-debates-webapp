had been mocking her decrepitude, "maybe
they'll be better for it."
Mr. Speaker, as the millions of people visit
the tomb and monument of Abraham Lincoln
in the years that are to come, and pause at that
sacred ahrine, may we not hope that they and
the world may be the better for it ? In ancient
days the fond mother pointed to the life and
deeds of Alexander, and said, "Son, be like
him." We need not go back to ancient days
to find bright examples to awaken noble aspir-
ations in the breasts of our children. We
have brighter examples in our own land and
age. Washington and Lincoln are more glo-
rious examples of all that is good and great
than can be found in any other age or nation.
Mr. Speaker, I hope the resolution may be
adopted.
The amendment was adopted.
Thejointresolution, as amended, wasordered

contested election.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I desire to call up the
report of the Committee of Elections 011 the
contested-election case from the seventh con-
gressional district of Virginia, of Whittlesey vs.
AIcKenzie.
The SPEAKER. For consideration at the
present time?
Mr. CHURCHILL. Yes, sir.
The SPEAKER. It cannot be done; the
House being now under the pressure ot the
previous question on a bill which comes over
from yesterday. What is now going on is by
unanimous consent.
Mr. BURR. I tlihik there will be no dis-
cussion. The report is a unanimous one.
The SPEAKER. In that event the House
will 110 doubt entertain it.
The resolutions reported by the Committee
of Elections were read, as follows:
Remised. That Charles Whittlesey is not entitled
to a seat as a mem ber of the Eorty^l'irst Congress
from the seventh congressional district or Virginia.
Resolved, That Lewis MeKenzie is entitled to a
seat as a member of the Forty-First Congress from
the seventh congressional district ot Virginia.
The question was taken on the first resolu-
tion ; and it was agreed to.
The question was next taken 011 the second
resolution ; and it was agreed to.
Mr. CHURCHILL moved to reconsider the
vote by which the resolutions were agreed to;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. CHURCIirLL. I also send to the desk
a resolution in regard to the compensation to
be made to the contestant.
Mr. IIOLMAN. I desire to make a parlia-
mentary inanirv. Is this a privileged report?
The SPEAKER. The Chair could not
regard a resolution as to compensation as a
privileged report.
Mr. CIIURC1IILL. This resolution is re-
ported as part of the report of the committee.
It was not a part of the original report, but it
has been considered by the committee, and
received their unanimous approval.
Mr. F AI v N S W 0 KT IT. I wish to inquire
whether in the judgment of the committee
there was the slightest probable cause for the
contest on the part of Mr. Whittlesey ?
Mr. BENJAMIN. I object to the considera-
tion of the resolution at the present time.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state to
the gentleman from New York [Mr. CnnRCH-
ii.l] that, although the first two resolutions
were privileged, the unqualified privilege of
the Committee of Elections in regard to a re-
port as to the right to a seat does not carry
with it as privileged a resolution as to compen-
sation. The objection, therefore, of the gen-
tleman from Missouri [Mr. Benjamin] must
prevent its consideration. The gentleman from
New York can present it on Monday after the
morning hour, by a suspension of the rules, or
during the call of States.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I do not desire to con-
test the decision of the Chair; but I have
always understood that a resolution with refer-
ence to compensation when brought up in con-
nection with the resolutions in regard to the
right to the seat was treated as part of the
same privileged report.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would be com-
pelled to rule otherwise. Such a resolution is
not privileged.
equalization of bounties.
Mr. COBB., of Wisconsin. I ask unanimous
consent to report back from the Committee
on Military Affairs, for consideration at this
t-ime, the bill (II. R. No. 1910) to equalize
bounties of soldiers who served in the late war
for the Union.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection?
Mr. HOLMAN. I ask that the bill be read
before objections are called for.
The SPEAKER. If it gives rise to debate
it cannot be considered. The bill will be
reported for information.
The bill was read in part, and is as follows:
