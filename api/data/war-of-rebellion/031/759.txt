Roache's House, Near Fort Albany, November 15, 1862.

General WOODBURY,

Commanding Engineer Brigade:

Respectfully,

STEPHEN CHESTER,

Captain, Commanding Detachment.

P. S.-I find that the requisition for rations, which I prepared this morning, has already gone in, and but a portion of the same been issued. The remainder will be drawn at the earliest possible hour in the morning, which, of course, will render it extremely difficult for my command to report in regimental camp to-night.
