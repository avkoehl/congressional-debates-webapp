whether you or the proper State authority shall command these State reserves, and the Legislature with great unanimity determined to leave them under the command of the proper State authority. If you are not the 'solitary exception on the other side" who find fault with the action of the Legislature, I would submit whether modesty may not suggest the propriety of your acquiescence in the decision of the General Assembly of your State upon this point. I do most respectfully insist that while engaged in the command of reserves, who you must admit are a very useful organization, you should have a little more fellow-feeling for those who are engaged in the Honorable and useful employment, which occupies all your own time which you cannot spare to the important political duties of your office. In your letter appears a reiteration of your former statement that from your knowledge of the members of the Legislature they never intended to exempt all State officers, though they have solemnly declared on their official oaths that they did so intend. And you go further, and in effect say that neither congress nor our supreme court nor anybody else but myself ever conceived the idea that the justices of the peace, constables, and militia officers (for whom you seem to have a great aversion) were to be exempt.

I am aware that you, while your fellow-generals were in front of the enemy in the field, spent days and nights in Milledgeville lobbying and lecturing the members of the Legislature at its late session for the purpose of convincing them that it was their duty to sanction the late act of Congress suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; but as neither your knowledge of them nor their knowledge of your influenced them to sustain your views, I am still at a loss to know, and you have not been pleased to say, how you are able to determine from your knowledge of the members that they did not understand the meaning of plain English words, and when they said all civil and military officers should be exempt, they did not mean justices of the peace, constables, and militia officers; and how it was that the supreme court, when they said State officers and agents, did not mean justices of the supreme court are sworn to support, expressly makes justices of the peace as much State officers as judges of the supreme court. As this new rule, which you have the honor of discovering, of interpreting the meaning of the language used by the Legislature by your simple knowledge of the members, which proves that the English word "all" means only part, is unknown to the authorities on the rules of construction, and as you have not thought proper to explain or elaborate it I presume the world must remain in ignorance of it till such time as you may think proper to enlighten the judges and other luminaries of the law. I suppose you were guided by this new secret rule of construction when you, while referring to my certificate, use this language:

The Legislature had declared that all civil and military officers should be exempt; still, you did not say that the Legislature demanded the exemption; your language is, "I claim, as exempt," &amp;c.

To say that the Legislature has declared that all civil and military officers shall be exempt, but the Legislature does not demand their exemption when it says they shall be exempt, is to draw a d, I presume, would be rather refined for the comprehension of the supreme court.
