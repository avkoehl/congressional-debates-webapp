CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr ARNOLP proceeded. The gentleman from Louisiana
observed, "I understand you are a great hand at keeping order,
sir" I answered him I try to do so, to which he answered
that I was the most disorderly member of the House. He saw
at once, Mr A continued, that the gentleman wanted to have a
difficulty with him, and h* was determined to have none, and I
admonish gentlemen that 1 belong to the peace party, and if
these fighting gentlemen become íampant and want to fight,
there are a few Seminóles 1 eftand they had bet ei go and fignt
them
[Here there was so much noise and confusion that the Report-
er couid not hear what followed j
Mr A when heard again, went on to say, that the gentleman
from Louisiana canaehisseat, and told him "he was a d-----d
coward 'and 'ad-—-j blackguard," and that, if he did not be
have bettei, "he would cut his. throat ft- m ear to ear " If the
Democracy employe 1 peisons to buily members here, he
hoped that if any of ttiem came to cut his throat he would
make a mistake and cm his own, which would be a great deal
better    [A laugh ]
[Mr Hhett heie rose to call Mr A to oider for irrele-
vancy ]
Mr A said he was speaking of the disorder of this House,
and if there ceuld be a case mote daectly relevant to that sub
ject on the fact, oí God Almighty s globe, he should be glad to
hear it If the Democracy chose to laugh at these things, let
them, he thought they weie bettei calculated to make a man's
blood to curdle in his veins Was a man's Ufe to be threatened
because he endeavored t_  support the Chan jn enforcing the
ordei of a legislative body? But let gentlemen take their
course, neither pistols nor bowie knives shall ever avail to m
duee theui to sweive a hair's breadth fiom the path of his duty
If they chose for this to muider him, let them tiyit "a cowaid
died many deaths, a brave man could die but once" These
frequent scenes of uproar and disorder had operated as impedí
ments, as ckevaux de fj ises m the channel oi legislation, and
the people observed and complained of it
Mr A said he had a word oi two to the aged gentleman
from Massachusetts and the young gentleman from Vnpinia
In offering them he meant no offence The gentleman's locks
were now b'eached by the snows of neaily four scoice years,
his palsied hand might daily be witnessed by ever/ gentleman
who observedhimm his seat, oi when addtessmg the House, his
feeble step in the streets admonished all who looked upnn him
that he was near that bourne fiom which no üavllerietmns
He could say nothing willingly to wound the feeling ot Micha
man And he confessed that it g ive hrni pa n to see him beaided
and assailed, again and again, from day to day, by those who
were, in compauaon, butbeirdiebs boy, noi did itcau«ehim
less regret to see that venerable man, when thu& piovoked,
viving vent to his, passions in the manrei that was too often
witnessed heie Tiue, it was very natural, hut yet it was

was perfectly known to those who vevtd him, arlihatroip

supposed himself to be in the right, and he there ore the moie
regretted to soe these buys getting up and rasping ami chaiiug
and bullying htm Yes, boys—who weie but ofyesfeiday m
comparison to him, and who were not out of then swaddling
c othes when that gentleman wa« seivmghis country m the
lushest stations Mr A had lon« known the character of the
gentleman as a politician, he was among the boldest and most
fearless, he never long! tundei aftl&eilag but "wore his heart
upon the sleeve foreveiy daw to pick at " Mi A advcited to
the days in which the gentleman from M s-arhnsrts the

very much like the lemuant of a i oU st imp speech [ilatt ]
prepared for some ohscure ne ¡ihbnihood where the people lid
not read much, an 1 it put Mi A m mind oi a speech he had
once heard delivered with gre it vehemence bv a sfump oiator
m the West before an election, who, when he got down from the
stump, said to Mr A witha laueh l Did I not putit into them
about British party'5 I know they hate Adams, and I thought
that more likely to go down with themttnn any thing else 1
could say' Mi A had seen the same farce played off more than
once, but it was now most untimely
Mr A next proceeded to notice some very extraordinary
points of coincidence between the aged and venerable gentle
man from Massachusetts and the young gentleman from Vir
gmia The young gentleman had charged Mi A with being
a Federalist, and a descendant of the Federal aristocracy,
and then made a great flourish about his own descent from
the old Federalists of Virginia, and of his family being
associated with the Marshalls Nay, he had not a relative,
living or dead, on the ground or under it who was not a
Federalist, and he did not intend to hear them abused heie
Here, *then, were a couple of Federalists, whose apparent
conflict so completely tended one way, 'hat a bystander might
suppose it a sham fight—that they were, in reality, kith
and kin, and allien, leagued together to help up the cause, of
ahohtion
[Here some explanations passed, in which Mr Wise denied
Ins having ever admitted that he wasorevei had been himself a
Federalist ]
Mr A admitted this, but his family were and what was bred
in the bone was hard to get out of the flesh [A laugh ] All
his fathers had lived and died Federalist* he, alone, was a De
mocrat That circumstance alone, was enough to subjecthim
to suspicion He and the gentleman ftom Massachusetts very
often voted together on great national questions, and he believed
they were both what were called "Tyler WhjgV'andsuppoit-
erb of the present Administration Mi A undei^tood such to
he the sentiments of the gentlpman from Massachusetts, and
that he was opposed to restricting the veto, at. proposed by a
distinguished Senator in theothei House
Tbegentleman from Virginia was a Tylei Whig, of course,
but Mr A must say he thought that he had observed of late
that the gentleman was shifting his sails a httle Piobably he
perceived that Captain Tyler was likely to get nothing more
than a corporal's guard, and that at the same time he noticed
with satisfaction the very loving attachment and loyalty mam
fested toward himself bylhat modern "Democracy" which no
body living had so excoriated for vt.ars as that very genth man
Oh, if any thing was calculated to nil a man s soul with dis
gust, it was to see these men on whom he had oncp heaped the
most vi upeiative epithets that the languageafforded now con
suiting him on all occasions, and ready to fawn and lick his
very feet' But a whipped cut wat, e\er the most fawning
do£j
Accoidmg to  appearances,  Mr   A  rathe)  suspected that
I Captan Tylei ' would before \eiy long be left even without
sn much as the corporal's guard which now adheiedto him
The country it would seem, was to be divided between a great
Whig party on the one hand, and on the other the old I ocoFoco
party headed tv the gen lern^an fiom Virginia [A laugh ]
Coming events weie said to cast their slndow--before and it
ceemed likely that the redoubtable Captain iyier in tttempting
o Mt upon two stools, *\uu'd uhno liat on the Oiounl—a fate
he well deseived  as eveiy irai or ih 1
Suchbnns the coincidences between thpse two biofherFede
iahs*s, Mr A thought that they ought fo make up and meet
ab friends Indeed, they «seemed ma le foi each other, they were
so nearlv alike m their tempeit, and pa=smns Both weie of the
genuine redera! stock- both v^eieopposed to limiting the veto
—both piofetbcd to be opposed to Abolition—and they weie,
