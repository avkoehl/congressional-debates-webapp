It would not establish castes and distinctions m so-
ciety, and of "om-e v ould not suit the taste of
those who behove that one class of men will

ing system, as now contended for, would not ac-
complish all this, n would have, I fear, but few
friends among (hose it ho now advocate it.
We a-e told, however, that the object which the
Administration and its friends have in view, is, to
break down all the State banks, in order to secute

them up, if I can undei stand concctly what I am
doing I disappiove of general denunciations
against them on this floor, and all I have said
íespectmg them has been with the view of showing
the propriety and necessity of separating from, and
leaving them entirely uninfluenced by, anv action
of Cona^ess Their friends, however, contend

our constituents ever dreamed, that in clothing us

absolu'e control, for t ie time being, ov er h s ent re
estate Yet to this lat tud nanan construction of
the Constitution are gentlemen compelled to come
to sustain the pi sition they assume, that Con-
gress is bound to furiiish a currency for thecounlry
Í am, mvself, clearly of opinion, that  this last po-
sition is the most indefensible and dangerous part
of the a hols system. Give to Congress the power
to make at its pleasure acurrency ioi the people, and
you vest m and confer upon that body, the highest
preiogative claimed by a crown, and one that is in
the very face of the Constitution itself When I
cease to oppose doctrine , ot this kind, I shall do
so because I have more convincing arguments in
its favor than I have heard on the present occasion,
and this I believe no one need expect to hear I
am fully convinced, that, m our Government, the
taxing powei is to be exercised for specific pur-
poses, and taxes tan only be paid in money I
am not entirely without authority on this last
point. I find that the Supieme Court ot the State
New Yotk, in a case repotted m bib. Johnson, de
culed, that the vvotd taxes meant a contnbution by
the people m money, not labor or other articles, and
I contend that this is the tme and only meaning of
tht word, as used in the Constitution of the United
States But gentlemen attempt to get over this
palpable truth, by asserting that whatever Congicss
receives as money, is mono. In thtir imagina-
tions die touch of Congress, like the touch of
Midas, turns every thingwith which itcomcsmcon-
tact into gold If vi e can make ihe Ameiu an peo-
pk believe such liblis as th' si, it is nowutidei
that they look to Congiess for bread
Gut gentlemen, m then hostilitv to the Vlmmis-
tiation, clungi even then love for the papei system
They shuddei with a kind ot political horroi at the
sight of a Tieasnry note, and etcn m tins debatí
haie held them up befoie our eyes in derision of
the Government    The Government has done no-
thing in this case to merit censure irom the most
fattuhous    It has done that which an honest man
would do under like circumstances    Permit me,
sir, to illustrate my ideas by a lamillat and snven
case     I agice to pay myhonoiable < olicigue, who
sits on my right, a certain sum of monev tor sei-
i lees which he is to render     1 have tht  money  on
hand, and, wishing to keep  it  safely for that pur
pose, l deposite it with my honorable friend fiom
Pennsylvania, who sits befoie me, as one in whom
1 have entne confidence     My colleague peilornn
the   erviee, In applies to me foi piymenl  I call on
my lnend foi the money I deposited with him, he
k fuses to lelurn it,  and, like the banks, infnims
mi   bo has stopped specie payment     Sit, I have
been deceived, and all 1 can do is to lermmetate, as
lai   as possible, my colleague foi his disappoint-
ment    I still have credit left, though no mot  y
I give him my note payable at a given penod,
I earing such interest a¡  will enable him to omivert
it into monev if be should wish to do so     Have I
done wrong!   No bull have suffered wrong, and
what difference, I pray }ou, exists betvvei n tin act
of the Government in tht issue of Treasury ni tes
and the case I have put?    ( ongress made appro-
pnations  of the public   money on  baud, and, in
older to keep it safely, and have it ready  to  meet
those appropriations win n tin object foi winch they
were madi  was accomplished, deposited the monc)
in tnc State banks, wnh Ihe mo t s lemn assuiinee
en   the part of the binks to ltfund it when called
for      Pbe af pre pr itie ns be ing needed, application
was mule to the binks   foi   the  monev, who very
niictri monionslv   inlermed   tin   Oineimneiil that
they   had stopped specie pay mi nts    The Govern
nient  being thus  dcenvid an I imposed upon by
thesi corporations over wh un it couid even ise no
li gal control, imorm d its c reditois that they should
hate the notes of the Government, bearing such
interest as would ma1 c  then, equal   to   rm ney,
making those notes pavable m a short lime    This
is "the whole head and ii<' * < f the offence" winch
gentlemen chaise   upon   the Government in tin
affair     It is no more     The ctunliy will soon con-
sider this qu stion, i il I have no doubt r ghtlully
decide i\   I rejoice" m the th iij-hl th it I live under
a  Government where gent eren  opposed  to its
admaiistiation, of such gieal ability and  untirn g
industry, have not been able to produce a charge
aBamst it of a more serious character than this,
and one which can be no belter sustained     The
shafts which they hurl mos,t assuredly rebound upon
themselves
I fear Mr Piesident that I am wearying the pa-
tience of the Senate, and my own state of health
admonishes mé to bring my remarks to a close.
What I have satd, brings me to the details of the
bill under consideration, and my peculiar situation
requires of me an explanation on this point The
bill contains two distinct and" separate principle?.
The first provides for the safe-keeping of the pub-
lic money; for which it is not only the right, but
the duty of Congress to provide. The second un-
dertakes to describe the funds to be ieeetved in
payment oí revenue. It contains, in my opinion,
this contradictory and unconstitutional provision.
That the resolution of 181b, (so far as it authorizes
the receipt in payment of taxes, duties, salís of the
public lands, debts or sums of money accruing or
becoming due to ihe united States, to be collected
and paid m the notes of .specie paying banks, shall
be so modified as that one-sixth part of such sums
becoming due the United Stales, shall upon the
1st day of December next, be paid in the legal cur-
rency of the United States, and thus rateably in-
creasing in the same proportion, for the term of six
years.
For this provision I cannot vote, because it is
contrary to all the settled doctrines and opinions
that I have advanced during the whole course of
my political life, and because it, also, is at war
with the opinions I have expressed, and concedes
the whole ground to the Opposition, that whatever
Congicss calls money and receives as such, is mo-
nev , and above all, it establishes and gives up the
principle that Congress may, under certain circum-
stances, connect this Government with the banking
institutions oi the States, If we admit the principle,
we give up the whole ground for which we have
been contending It is true, that, at the late session
ol Congicss, I voted for a somewhat similar provi-
sion in the bill then befoie the Senate, on the same
subject, but I did so undei a kind of duress, and re-
flectiim has satisfied me that my vote then was
wiong I voted m a nnnoiity of only six at the
pitcetling session on an amendment ofleieel by the
Senator fiom Vngmia, containing the same ptmci-
ple as the substitute he has now offered. I gave
that v ote without consultation with any human be-
ing, and I was much gra'ified to find myself in the
majority when called on to give a like vote at the
extra session, I then hoped that this question was
settled, and that bank paper would not again be
named as a proper receipt into the Treasury, but m
this it seems I am mistaken.
My first objection to the constitutionality of the
act incorporating the Bank of the United Slates,
was that it permitted the notes of that institution lo
be received in payment of the public dues That
opinion I have nevei changed I am constrained,
ihtrt lore, by every constdeiation, to vote against
this b.ll, should this provision be continued m it.
It is true, sir, theie are other expressions and de-
tails in the bill, which, though involving no impor-
tant punciple, I would gladly see altered. I dis-
like the parade of bars, bolts, sales, and iron chests,
and rr< eivers general, which it contemplates, all
which are matters of show, more than necessity
They have alieady here been used as strong objec-
tions, and should the bill so pass, we must under-
value the s igacily of our opponents, if they do not
use them with mote success m the country The
liontsl, unsuspecting citizen will be taught to be-
lieve that those m office are attempting to seize on
the public money for then own use and that all
this device is for that purpose, that as sc on as these
coders are filled, the Government will declare itself
independent of the people.
¡i is true there is nothing m all this argument,
jet, if one election tan be gained by it, a valuable
purptw, no doubt, to some gentlemen, will be an-
w ered In re fusing 'o promise by law the receiv-
ing of bank notes inpayment of public dues, nis not
intended, m the least degiee, to discredit those in-
stitution j, which belong exclusively to the States,
and subject alone lo State power, and State contiol.
That ihe policy oí the country is now, in some de-
gree, connected with the banking system, I readily
admit, but this is a domestic policy, operating dif-
ferently m the soveraf States, not brought upon lha
people by an act of Congress, nor does Congress
nghtfully possess the power to regulate it. The
condition of the country, brought upon it by the
action of the State Governments, nevei ought to
