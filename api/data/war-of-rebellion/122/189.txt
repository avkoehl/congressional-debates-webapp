service at the place and dates specified below under the first requisition of the War Department:

New York City.-First Regiment, Colonel Allen, May 9, 1861; Fifth Regiment, Colonel Duryee, May 8, 1861; Seventh Regiment, Colonel Bendix, May 10, 1861; Fourth Regiment, Colonel Hudson, May 10, 1861.

Albany.-Second Regiment, Colonel Carr, May 10, 1861; Third Regiment, Colonel Townsend, May 8, 1861; Fourteenth Regiment, Colonel McQuade, May 10, 1861; Sixteenth Regiment, Colonel Davies, May 10, 1861.

Elmira.-Twelfth Regiment, Colonel Walrath, May 8, 1861; Thirteenth Regiment, Colonel Quinby, May 8, 1861.

Colonel Ellsworth, Eleventh Regiment [New York Firemen], is already in the field, where, it is presumed, it was mustered into the U. S.service. The irregularity of its leaving the State before the requirements of the law and regulations were complied with is not chargeable to this office.

These regiments will be clothed and armed and equipped forthwith, and will be subject to the orders of the War Department, which I have to request may be communicated for the information of the commander-in-chief. At the same time it is desirable to be instructed as to the subsistence of these regiments after they shall have been mustered into the U. S. service.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. MEREDITH READ, JR.,

Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 11, 1861.
