HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-6 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Warren is directed to main thin his hold and intrench himself. When may we look for Hancock?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 18, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I think it will be advisable to hold Hancock where he is until to-morrow night. I will direct him if he can hold his position to send one division to-night.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-7.15 p. m.

General GRANT:

Warren can hold his own, I think, and may perhaps yet push the enemy. I ought to have mentioned that, when he spoke of Ayres' division, he referred to the Maryland Brigade, which he had previously reported as giving way.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
