Brigadier-General LYTLE,

Commanding Post:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that I have to-day thrown a pontoon-bridge from the island to the south bank of the Tennessee River near your post. To protect the bridge I would suggest that at least two regiments of infantry be thrown across at once, encamping on the opposite bank. The regiments can cross from the north bank to the island, in pontoon-boats, and, marching over the island and the bridge, will experience no difficulty, I cannot too strongly present to you the importance of this step, nor mention the danger of delay. Please acknowledge the receipt of this.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE BURROUGHS,

Lieutenant of Engineers.
