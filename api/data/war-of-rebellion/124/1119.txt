From which there is to be made a

further deduction of the amount of

disbursements, as ascertained from

accounts for periods prior to and

in the fiscal year ending June 30,

1863, which have been received and

registered, but of which the required

administrative examination has not

been made, viz:

Prior to the fiscal year......... $14,460,388.14

In the first quarter............ 17,356,069.88

In the second quarter............ 53,336,583.84

In the third quarter............. 54,034, 182.58

In the fourth quarter............ 54,102,022.58

193,289,247.14

Less amount shown to have been

received from sales of property,

rent of buildings, &amp;c............ 4,193,824.75

Which is made up as follows, viz:

1. Amount of requisitions drawn in favor of officers,

the accounts for disbursements of which have not bee

received at this office............................. 46,537,380.43

Of this amount, $2,349,192.33 was drawn in the

fiscal year ending, June 30, 1862.

The balance, $44, 188, 188.10, was drawn in the fiscal

year ending June 30, 1863, and should have been

accounted for as follows, viz:

In the first quarter............. $1,744,778.10

In the second quarter............ 9,173,090.00

In the third quarter............. 15,724,713.00

In the fourth quarter............ 17,545,607.00

--------------

44, 188, 188.10

A large portion of this, although remitted during

the fiscal year, could not have been received

before its termination, and will be accounted

for hereafter. The greater portion has doubtless

been accounted for direct to the proper accounting

officer of the Treasury Department, as required by

the act of Congress approved July 17, 1862.

2. Amount in the hands of officers unaccounted for

(as ascertained from balances found due the Govern-

ment, upon examination of the last accounts received

and from receipts for advances made to officers or

disbursement) by officers whose accounts have been

rendered.......................................... 6,571,300.49

Of this amount the sum of $2,735,338.05 was due

prior to and in the fiscal year ending June 30,

1862.

The balance, $2,835,962.44, was due in the fiscal

year ending June 30, 1863, and should have been

accounted for as follows, viz:

In the fist quarter............. $668,625.15

In the second quarter........... 434,763.58

In the third quarter............ 807,383.34

In the fourth quarter...........1,925,190.44

--------------

3,835,962.44

The greater portion of this has probably been

accounted for direct to the proper accounting

officer of the Treasury Department, as required

by the act of Congress before referred to.

3. The remainder is distributed among the officers

disbursing at the various posts and stations and

in the field, and is applicable to the payment

of debts contracted during the year, by which

it will undoubtedly be absorbed. It is........... 14,428,866.93

--------------

Total balance as before.......................... 67,537,547.85
