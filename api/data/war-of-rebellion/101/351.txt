FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 31, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

All returns of troops in this command are in Saint Louis; none here. I telegraphed Captain Bell to send me copy outside of Utah. I am sending supplies on plains for northern route for 12,000 men for one year from 1st of May; on southern route six months for 7,000 men. I do not see how I can reduce the force on the plains before fall. Several regiments go out of service then. With the Indians all hostile, over 3,500 miles of overland route and every stage and train to be guarded, it takes a large force. We are putting supplies into Utah for 4,500 men. General Connor calls for supplies for 5,000 men, but I have reduced it to 4,000, and I understand this meet the approval of Government. When I spoke to you about it you approved it. We have got to put more troops in Utah this winter or we will have trouble. Last spring I could do nothing for want of supplies on the plains, and I think we should now provide sufficient for every contingency. If so directed I can reduce the supplies sufficient for every contingency. If so directed I can reduce the supplies in Utah to 2,500 men. These men, you are aware, have to come from the 12,000 I put supplies east of the mountains for. I have concluded upon settling the matter on the southern route and withdrawing most of the troops, and therefore have only provided and withdrawing most of the troops, and therefore have only provided supplies for six months for them from May 1. No requisitions go to Washington that I know of. The depot quartermaster and commissary send their requisitions to Colonels Haines and Myers. The stores for northern route have mostly gone forward. I cut down many of these requisition one-third, and have telegraphed about it. But when officers on the plains send in requisitions the officers here fill then. Commissary supplies, expect for Utah, have gone forward for northern route. If you say I shall reduce Utah to supplies for 2,500 men, telegraph me, as the stores have not yet left.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Major-General DODGE:

Supplies for 2,500 men in Utah will be sufficient.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., August 2, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

Have written to you fully to-day my views and wishes. Soon as expedition returns military arrangements must be reduced to simple protection of overland routes. I have fixed upon 4,500 infantry and 2,500 cavalry as the force necessary in your command for that purpose. All other troops are to be mustered out as soon as expeditions now in progress are over, however they may end. Regulate sending out supplies on this basis. I have sent you very full instructions on the subject. What is wanted of military posts at Lawrence, Olathe, and elsewhere in Kansas? Dispense with them if possible, reducing everything to the lowest standard possible.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
