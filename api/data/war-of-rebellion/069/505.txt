HEADQUARTERS, June 2, 1864. (Received 1.20 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that I think my line perfectly indefensible without more troops. I have been obliged to take the only brigade in reserve to fill up a gap in my lines.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 2, 1864. (Received 2.20 a. m.)

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 2, 1864.*

Major-General MEADE,Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Your order for an attack in the morning is received. I have endeavored to represent to you my condition. In the present condition of my line an attack by me would be simply preposterous; not only that, but an attack on the part of the enemy of any vigor would probably carry my lines more than half their length. I have called on General Wright for about 100,000 rounds of ammunition, and have asked it to-night. Deserters report the enemy massing on my right for an attack early in the morning.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 2, 1864-2.30 a. m. (Received 2.40 a. m.)

Major General W. F. SMITH,Commanding Corps

(Through General Wright's headquarters):

Your dispatch of 2.20 a. m. received. The major-general commanding directs me to reply that he has done everything in his power to have a supply of ammunition sent to you at the earliest possible moment.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
