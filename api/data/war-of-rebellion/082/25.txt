JONES' NECK, July 5, 1864.

General G. WEITZEL;

On the receipt of your dispatch last evening I caused all preparations to be made to meet the enemy should he make his appearance this morning, but up to this time the usual quiet has prevailed.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 5, 1864.

General R. S. FOSTER:

Dispatch received; the general thinks that attack is coming, but supposes they did not get ready by this morning. He believes that the attack on you will be a feint to cover a heavy attack on Meade's left.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.

JULY 5, 1864. (Sent 9 a.m.)

Brigadier-General FOSTER:

The commanding general directs that you destroy all forage and grain you can reach in your vicinity by fire or otherwise.

LUDLOW,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
