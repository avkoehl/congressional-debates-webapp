HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1863-5 a. m.

Brigadier General WILLIAM F. SMITH:

Major-General Meade desires me to say you can continue the pursuit of the enemy; that he only needs one regiment to guard the property and wounded at Gettysburg, for which he has sent to General Couch, supposing you were on the way to Chambersburg.

The army is concentrating at Middletown. You can join it there, after pushing the enemy to the best advantage.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Acting Chief of Staff.

Major-General COUCH:

An order was sent this morning to General Smith to continue the pursuit of the enemy to the best advantage, and not to go to Gettysburg. The Potomac River is now bank full at Williamsport, and there is no bridge.

General Buford attempted to take Williamsport yesterday. The enemy's infantry compelled him to retire. There are a good many wagons at Williamsport. Troops and wagons are being ferried over very slowly in two flat-boats. The main army of the enemy has not crossed, and must fight us before he can cross.

By order of the general commanding:

G. K. WARREN,Brigadier General Vols., Chief Engineer, Actg. Chief of Staff.
