chicago relief.
Mr. FINKBLNBURG. I ask unanimous
consent to present a memorial of the St. Louis
Board of Trade, for reference to the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means. I desire to have the
memorial read.
The memorial was read, as follows :
st. louis, missouri., February 1,1st2.
Hon. A. finklenbukg and Hon. eb^stus wells :
Please have the following preamble and resolu-
tions presented to both Houses of Congress at the
earliest practicable moment.
By order of theSt. Louis Board of Trade :
B. K. BONNER, President.
"Whereas a hill is now pending in the Congress
of the United States which provides for the import-
ation into the port of Chicago certain goods, wares,
and merchandise free of duty, for the purpose of
extending aid to the sufferers in the burnt district
in said city: Therefore,
"Be it resolved, That the merchants, manufac-
turers, and importers of St. Louis, through their
Board of Trade, respectfully represent that the pro-
posed mode of relief is impracticable and unjust in
this, that it would unsettle values, complicate the
collection of the revenue, open the way to traud,
and place the burden of relief upon a few classes
that should be borne equitably and alike by all.
" 2. Itceohcd, That any aid that Congress m its
wisdom may deem proper to extend, should be by
direct appropriation from the national Treasury, by
which process Congress and the whole country will
know the exact amount contributed, and every
interest will bear its proportion of a national tax to
rebuild Chicago.
