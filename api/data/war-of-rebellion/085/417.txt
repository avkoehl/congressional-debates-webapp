Major-General ROSECRANS:

Major-General ROSECRANS:

My stores are now in Jefferson City, except an ox train that left here to-day for that post, and a mule train loaded with subsistence stores that are here and needed for the troops. The artillery and mounted troops can be marched form here to Jefferson City in twenty hours. Seven companies now acting as outpost at Warrensburg and other points will require forty-eight hours. The infantry can be moved there in five hours by having a railway train ready to start at any time when it is needed.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SEDALIA, September 27, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

Ten companies of First Missouri State Militia and seven companies of the Seventh, and eight pieces light artillery, are concentrated here. The Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia are scouting east of this between the railroad and Missouri River. I am in camp with my command, and am having it inspected and fitted to move. If possible, the First Missouri State Militia should be rearmed. The report of the inspection has not been made out, but the usual reports show that that regiment's arms are very poor and of every possible kind and pattern. One company has Burnside carbines, old patters, nearly worthless; sixteen different patterns of breech-loading, nine of muzzle-loading, some double-barreled guns, and some men have nothing but revolvers. If arms can be obtained of a suitable character for mounted troops I respectfully ask that Captain B. F. Williams, acting ordnance officer for this district, be ordered to inspect the regiment, as required in Circular, Numbers 17, Ordnance Office, War Department, series 1863.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
