HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF CHIEF QUARTERMASTER,

Camp near Cold Harbor, Va., June 10, 1864.,

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report for the information of the general commanding that probably most of the transports employed in transporting the Eighteenth Army Corps to White House have been unloaded and used to send away wounded and unserviceable property. Some are still at White House with stores which belong to the corps. Captain Pitkin had positive orders to detain no transports at that depot, but to keep all actively employed. In order, therefore, to insure the prompt movement of General Smith's command from the Chickahominy to Bermuda Hundred on his arrival at Cole's Ferry, I would respectfully recommend that Lieutenant Colonel H. Biggs, chief quartermaster at Fort Monroe, or other competent officer be ordered to assemble suitable transports, and to be at the time and place designated, in person, to superintend the transportation. Colonel Biggs, for instance, will have it in his power to call in all the boats that may be available in the Potomac, Pamunkey, and James Rivers. If the means of embarkation are not good in the Chickahominy, time will be gained by sending the corps direct from White House.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier General and Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
