Senate,
Havmg had occasion Mr IVsident, to speak of Nuilifica
tion and the ^ ulhfiera, I beg leave to sayT that I have not done
go for any parpo e ofieprtach Certainly, sir, I see no possr
ble connection, myself, between their principies or opinions,
and thesuppoitof this measure Ihey, however, muotspeak
for themselves 1 ley may have intru*-tetl the beating; of their
standard for aught I know, to the hand** of the honorable mem
her from South Carolina, and I peiceived last session what I
perceive now, that in his opinion there is a connection between
these piojects of Government and the doctrines of Nullifica
tion I can on'y-ny, sir th it it will be marvellous to me if that
banner, though it be satd to be tatterel and torn shall yet be
lowered in obeisance, and [aid at tí p footbtool of Executive
power To the sustaining of that power the passive of this
bill is of the utmost importance The Admmistiation will íe
gard its success as beingto th°m, what Cromwell said the bat

In thifc leiter,Mi President thewruereay* m substance that

Jong   and aiduous druggie, against the encroichments  and
abuse^oi t'e Genual Govt nmei t, "t lo-   the fnuteofa1! their
labors
At that time he s lys, Sta e mterpo u on (\ iz Nullification)
had ovei thrown the protet «ng tariff, and the American system,
and puta stop to Congtessional usutpation, that he had pre
vioLsIybeenum ed with the National Republicans, andihat
then joint attacks had biought down the power of the Execu
Uve, but that, m joining such allies, he was nof insensible to
the embarnssment of his posmon that, with them, victory it
self wa dangerois, and that, therefore, he had been waiting
for events that^ow (that is to Bay, m September last) the
joint attacks of the allies had brought down Eiecntive power,
that the Admi'ftf ration had become diverted of power and m
fluence and that it had become cteai that ihe coTibmed attacks
of the allied fotces would utterly overthrow and demohsh it
Allthishesaw But he taw,too,as be say« that in that case
the victory wou d enure, not to h m or hi  cause, but to hi  al
lies and th°u cause I do not viean to «ay that he ^pokeof pei
sonal vicf >nes, or alluded topeisonal object, at ail He spoke
oí his cause
It pioceed^ to say, tl en, thai never was there befue and ne

■¡whey and to reap the fruits of then long and arduous stmg
glrt lliese pnn^jples and this policy,sir,be it remeinbeud, he
represents ail along as identified with thf pimciplecand po icy
of nullification And he makes use of this glorious opportum
ty, by lefusing to join his late allies in any futther attack on
tho&e in puwei, rallying anew the old State Kuhts parh to hold
in check then old opponents the Natini al Ke[ ub'ican party
Thi ho says would enable him to pi event the comple'e aseen

cases, and a very    roper exercise of its j ower, to de osite
money, even wnh individuals, in such manner as that it is ight
be advantageous to the depositary    Tins incidental or con
sequential advantage results,  often, from the nature of the
transaction, and is inseparable from i     It may slway3 be
enjoyed,  more or less,  by any one, who holds  public mo
ney for disburemenf      In order io the necessary exercise of
any of its powers, Government doubtless iiiay make contraeca
wtthbjnks or other coiporations as well as with individuals
If it has occasion to buy bills of exchange, it may buy them
of banks    If it has stock or Treasury notes to sell, it may sell
to banks as the Secretaiy of the Treasury has lately pioposed
It may employ banks  therefore, at its diseretion, for the keep
ins. of the public moneys, as those moneys must be kept some
where    It can no more need a specific grant of power in the
Constitution for such a purpose, than one merchant, beiommg
agent for another to receive any pay o it money, wouM need a
particular clause in his authority, enabling him to u e banks
for thete pin poses as other pexsons use them    No question has
e^er been rnsed in this Government about the power of Con
gres* to authorize sach deposites     Mr Madison, in opposing
the fast bank chariei in 1791, argued, strenuously, that a Bank
of the United States was not necessary to Government as a de
pository oí the public moneys, because, he insisted, i(s n^
could be supplied by othei banks     This sufficiently showi his
opm on    And in 1800, C ongiess made it die duty oi the collec
tors of customs to deposite bonds for duties m the bank and Us
branches for collection
When the chartei of the fii&tbank expired, in 1811, almost
every gentleman who oppose fu«ienewal contended thatit was
not neces ary for the purpose of holding deposites of revenue,
because tetate Banks could answer all suchpuipOt.es equally
well     A •! ron* and pievaihng tone of argument runs  hrough
all the speeches on that occasion, tending to this conclusion,
viz that Govei  mem may derive from S ate banks a 1 the bene
fit which a Bank of the  United States could render     In 1816,
when the chartei of the last bar k was «ranie 1, it contained, así
ongmady presented no provi ion foi m king the pi liedepo
sues m the Bank    The bill was  probably dtawn mt is parti
oulai    ironi the model of the fiiet charter, in wi ch no euch
clause was contained, without adverting to the law of 1Q00, but
a action was mtro luced, on my motion, making if tne duty of
collectors to de¡ osiie the  pu  he rnonevt. in tlieB nk and its
branches    It was th s section of the law wuch «orne of us
thought was violated by the lemoval of the depopte"-    The
rvam object ofihe deposite hid of 1^36 a-> we kr *w, was to ic
guíate deposites of th   i ubhc money w   h the totate binks    <*o
that, fiom he commencement or the Go^ernmDnt to the pre
=¡ent time ncbuly hai thought of making any ques ion oí ire

The gentlem in s other piopo&ition, and which he lay odowi

aril il we make then money then we a abound to untiol and
regulate that money Vfo«¡tn itamly, air, I a^ieewith the bono
rabie meinhei that wh n bulk netes bpcome money we aie
bouno to control and resu'ate 'hem I than1 him ft r this ad
minion since it-ot-^a gitat way to support that proposition,
fo which I liave been corten ling Th it bank notes have be
come money in fact, that they a iswer i he uses of mo ey that,
in many respects, the law treats them as morev, iá certa n
Why then, are we notalready bound to control and regula e
them? The g^ntl^man will say, because we have not ourselves
made them money But is that any answer? It they have be-
come money in fait, they requ re the same regulation, and we
have the «amp authority to bestow it, as if they had acquued
that chaiac erby any acts ofot rown, because oin powei isge
neral it is to take care oí the money of the coun ry, ai i to ie
guíate all thegieat concerns of conmerce
But let  us s^e how this opinion of the honorable m-  i bet
stands upon the authoiitics in ourownhi^tory
When thefiit>t bantc was established, theuehtof Congiess to
create such a corporation was as we all know veiy much dis
puted I ar?e majon íes however, m bith Houses weie of
opinion that the right existed and they therefore giaued the
chsiter, and in thte charter theie ivasan expías*: piovi^ion that
the bills of the Bulk hould be receivable m all pay men's o
Government fho^e who opposed the Bmk did rot object to
this clause on the contrary, they went even much farther and
Mr Madison expie«sly insisted that Cungie** miQht giant ci
refuse to State tanks the privilege of na>mg their noes r<.
chived m revenue In 1791 therefore, men of ail paitie sup
po ed that Congiess, ir ita disc etion, might auii onze the r
ceipt ot bank notes The game principle was incorporated
