| Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I would suggest,
in reference to the bill which has just been referred,
that it has not been usual to order the printing of
a bill until it has been reported back from the com-
mittee.

customary course.

The SPEAKER. The resolution goes to that

Mr. TAYLOR. I move the following resolu-
tion, and ask the previous question:
Resolve?!, Tl*af flie Committee on Military Affairs! be in-
structed to inquire into th * expediency of changing the Mte
of the military asylum, near the city of Washington, riorn
its present location, to the estate of Mount Vernon, or a
part thereof, if the same can be purchased at a reasonable
price; and that ihe said committee al>o inquire and report
to thi< House the original cost of the present site of said
asvlum, the quantity of land contained therein, and the
amount expended in improvements up to this date; and
that they report to tins House, by bill or otherwise.
The question was put, and the resolution was
adopted,
Mr. SAPP, in pursuance of previous notice,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill; which
was read a first and second time by its title, as fol-
lows, and referred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary:
"A bill declaratory of the second section of the

tled 'An act t# continue half pay to certain widows
and orphans.'"
Mr. GREY, in pursuance of previous notice,
asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill; which
was read a first and second time by its title, as fol-
lows, and referred to the Committee on Public
Lands:
" A bill granting, to the State of Kentucky pub-
lic lands to aid in the construction of certain rail-
roads in that State."
Mr. PRESTON. I beg to offer the following
resolution, and 1 ask the indulgence of the House
for one second to make a statement. Under recent
decisions of the courts forgeries of land warrants
have not been deemed to have been provided for;
and persons who have committed such forgeries
have escaped punishment. I hold in my hand
some land warrants, the assignments to which
have been forged, and f am advised, by the appro-
priate Department, that the United States iaws at
present afford no remedy by which new warrants
can be issued to persons who have been deprived
of their rights under these warrants. It strikes
me, Mr. Speaker, that the United States should be
in the same position as a bank on which foigeries
are committed, and which is still responsible. I
therefore ask to refer to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary the resolution which I now introduce,
together with papers which I hold in my hand,
containing evidence of the fact in the cases of Lewis
Pelden and Frederick Walzinger, with a view
that the committee may report a bill to supply the
deficiency in the law.
The Clerk read theresolution,as follows :
Refolded, That the Committee on the Judiciary be in-
structed to inquire into the propriety of providing by law
for the proper punishment of persons who may forge as-
signments of land warrants, or other instruments of writing
affecting the rights of peisons entitled to bounty lands
under various laws of the United Slates in relation there-
to; and also to ptovule foi the is<-ue of new warrant- vvhne
the warfants have been wrongfully issued to persons not
entitled to lands, or whete land-* have been located or pat-
ent, d to persons not entitled thereto, and without the neg-
ligence or wrongful act of the persons justly entitled to
such bounty lands.
The question was put, and the resolution was
adopted.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ken-
tucky also moves that certain papers be referred
to that committee. Shall it be so ordered ?
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
Mr. STANTON, of Kentucky, offered the fol-
lowing lesolution:
Resolved. That a special committee of seven members
be appointed by the Speaker to inquire and report to this
Houm- whethei the appointment of military officer* to sn-
peimtend the manufacture of fnearms at the national ar-
mones, the construction of light houses, woiksof n'verand
| harbor impiovement, the building of custom-houses arid
: po^t offices, the construction of water woiKs for the cities
| ot Washington and Georgetown, the extension of the United
â€¢ States Capitol, and the survey and management of works
] ot internal improvement by the States, is compatible with
1 the public interest, and consistent -\vitb the nature; and
j chaiaeterof our civil government; that said committee also
j inquire and report to tiu'c Mouse how many of the^p mii
! itary officeis, in civil emplovment, are, mtiWted with the
' disbursement of the puhhc funds without bond and securifv
and to what extent they have been allowed to make tun-
tiacts and purchase materials for the public u-e without the
usual advertisement, and how their accounts are -settled nt
the public Treasuiy; that s.iid committee ftnihP} inquire
whether the present embarrassment of the Engineer De
partment, for want of officers, complained of m the annual
repoit of the colonel of the eoips, not occn-jon.'d bj the
withdrawal of s,nd officii from then proper duties, and
their employment in civil services ; and whether it i<* expe-
dient, under the circnnist nces, to grant an increase of said
corps; and that said committee have power to send for per-
sons and papers.
