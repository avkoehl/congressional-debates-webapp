FORT SUMTER, March 10, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that no correct observation have been made this morning. Two tugs are lying at the picket station and two monitors abreast of the 2,500-yard buoy. At 8 o'clock two large barges floated up the channel in the direction of Mount Pleasant, where they will probably be recovered. The wind was too high to attempt it from this post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. ELLIOTT, JR.,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, March 12, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that one monitor has just gone to the southward, leaving four. Some of the wooden vessels are provided with projecting beams and chairs for defense against torpedoes. A mortar or the re-enforce of a burst gun has just been carried away from Gregg.
