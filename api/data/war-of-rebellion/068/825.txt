General BURNSIDE:

I have official notice that up to yesterday 24, 700 men had sailed and were ready to sail from Washington to re-enforce this army. This number is exclusive of about 3,000 for the garrison of Belle Plain. Butler had carried the outer works at Fort Darling. Sheridan has cut both railroads leading from Richmond; had whipped Stuart's cavalry, and had carried the outer works at Richmond, besides whipping the infantry sent out the drive him away; thinks he cold have gone into the city, but not knowing our operations, nor those of Butler, did not know that he could stay; therefore went on in pursuance of his orders. Crook has cut the New River bridge, and destroyed all the stores at Dublin. I am in hopes he is now in Lynchburg. Sherman flanked the enemy, and drove him ut of Dalton. He was south and southwest of Johnston at 8 p. m. the 14th, and intended to attack him at all pints yesterday.
