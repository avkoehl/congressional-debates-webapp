COLONEL: I respectfully report that at 4. 30 this a. m. my division left its camp on Fishing Creek and moved out in a northerly direction, toward my present camp, crossing the Gaston railroad about midway between Macon Depot and Littleton Post-Office, and striking the main Warrenton road four miles from the river at noon to-day. There I halted until the passage of General Corse's column, when I moved forward in rear, camping at 3 p. m. on the ground assigned me to the left of Major-General Hazen's position. My headquarters are near the road, not far from those of the Fifteenth Army Corps. My troops have marched twenty-one miles since leaving this morning, and they give me no cause to complain on account of straggling or disorderly conduct.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
