Captain HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

The militia abandoned the railroad without giving me any notice. I at once sent Captain Weber with authority to distribute Lieutenant Harrison's company, of the Fiftieth, on the road. Lieutenant Harrison informs me that he has his men at South Big River and Saint Francis, and guarding Government property at Mineral Point and Hopewell. Have ordered troops to re-enforce him and to guard all points on the road. Will reach there to-day or to-morrow. Will communicate by special messenger more fully. Will forward rebel prisoners and send companies of the Fiftieth to De Soto.
