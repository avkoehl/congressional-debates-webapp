
battery to reconnoiter the country toward the Half-way House and toward Grove Wharf. The brigadier from Casey's division will take charge of the whole force. I wish them to act with caution as well as vigor, and to send word back to Lee's Mill for me often. A regiment of cavalry will be sent also, and I wish that to be ordered to look out for the enemy in the direction of Grove Wharf, and the artillery and infantry pushed forward to Half-way House if possible. Strong working parties must repair roads and bridges as far as the troops advance.

A regiment of cavalry will be sent toward Grove Wharf, and you will send also two batteries of artillery with the brigade which is to go forward. Graham being sick, I would prefer you should send Naglee,who will take direction of the whole reconnoitering force, and send word back often to me. Send strong working parties to repair the roads as far as the troops advance and occupy Lee's Mill strongly.
