COLONEL: A person just from Helena informs me that the following officers and soldiers are closely confined under charges of being guerrillas and that an effort will be made by the authorities there to execute them:

Lieutenant Thomas Casteel, Lieutenant John H. Yerby, adjutant, Private Thomas [A.] Quarles, Private Thomas Stoneham, of Dobbin's regiment, Lieutenant Thomas, adjutant White's regiment (Missouri) infantry.

The latter was wounded at Helena, July 4, 1863, and was arrested in Desha County. The others were captured near Laconia, in Phillips County. They-of Dobbin's regiment-represent that they were under orders at the time to collect men improperly absent from their commands, and all ask that the Government interpose in their behalf.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
