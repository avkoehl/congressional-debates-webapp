Major-General U. S. GRANT,Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: There is every indication that the enemy will attack our left this morning, as troops have been moving in that direction for some time.

It will be well to make preparation to send as many of the reserves as can be spared of the right wing in that direction as soon as an attack is made in force. At any rate, be prepared for an order to that effect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Captain KELTON,

Headquarters:

Please explain to me as early as possible the explosions at Corinth. The whole is now enveloped in dense smoke, yet the rebels are in my front. Cars ran all night with long trains. I have ordered Rosecrans forward and to my right.

Major-General.

CAMP NEAR CORINTH, May 30, 1862.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I cannot explain. General Pope telegraphed me about 1 o'clock this morning that the enemy opposite his left were receiving large re-enforcements, each train load as it landed being received with cheers. It is the impression that Corinth is to be given up, and a stand made in the angle between the two railroads.

Advance your forces and feel the enemy strongly if still in your front.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
