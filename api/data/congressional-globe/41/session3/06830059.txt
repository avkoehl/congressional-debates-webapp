tion of the poor. The precise effect of that
act can only be tested by time. It is not yet
in full force. And now we are met, in season
and out of season, with a demand that the only
tax on property, estimated to yield $13,000,000,
shall be repealed. No new facts are given us ;
no petitions are presented ; no official state-
ment is made; no other tax is complained of;
but we are urged to repeal the only tax that
bears hardly upon each of us. I submit whether
it is not better to leave well enough'alone, and
bear as well as we may our share of taxes; to
stand by the measures so lately adopted by us,
and turn our attention to the measures before
us that affect the great mass of our people.
Now, Mr. President, after these preliminary
observations, I come to test this question by
sober facts and figures; and I shall not rely
upon mere cursory estimates made as the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania made his, but upon
official documents, each one of which is printed
and laid on our tables. Now, for the first time
for many years, we are able to present exact
estimates of our expenditures. On account,
in the old mode of keeping the books in the
Treasury Department, of lapping and transfer-
ring appropriations, we were not enabled to
state specifically what sum was needed for the
expenditures of the Government within a given
year; but now fortunately the law of the last
session is in full operation, by which all the
old balances are transferred to the general
funds in the Treasury. The Secretary of the
Treasury now gives us a statement by depart-
ments of the probable expenditures of the
Government for the next fiscal year, ending
the 30t.h of June, 1872: and I ask the Secretary
to read that brief statement.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Legislative establishment  S3,263,966 34
Executive establishment  17,'238,165 50
Judicial establishment  2,348,750 00
Military establishment  28.488,194 00
Naval establishment  20,045,-*17 7/
Indian affairs  5 021,;j69 03
Pensions       30,000,000 00
Public works 
Postal service  -if onHto ™
Miscellaneous 
Permanent appropriations  132,028,234 00
Sinking fund    24.o00,000 00
Interest upon the capital of the sink-
ing fund  4.806,933 00
Total  $309,639,319 61
Mr. SHERMAN. Thus thestatement of total
estimates of expenditure is $309,039,319 01;
but it must be remembered that of these esti-
mates the greater part, nearly two thirds of
them, are beyond our control or limit. There
is provided in the nature of permanent and
fixed appropriations, for the payment of inter-
est on the public debt and the expenses of col-
lecting the customs, $132,528,234. There is
provided for the sinking fund and interest on
it, under the act of February 25, 1862, and the
act of the last session, $29,366,933. There
is also provided for pensions, $30,000,000,
making an aggregate of $191,865,167 that is
beyond our leach or power. These sums are
either required to pay the interest on the pub-
lic debt, to meet the expenses of collecting
the customs, to pay our pensions, or to pay the
sinking fund, just as much a part of the loan
as the interest itself; so that $192,000,000 is
demanded by laws which we cannot change
or alter, leaving a balance of $117,714,152 to
cover all the expenses of the^ Government,
That, includes the Army, the Navy, the legis-
lative establishment, and the judicial establish-
ment. All the departments of the Govern-
ment must be paid out of the $117,000,000.
It must be remembered that the Secretary
of the Treasury expects us to carry out our
pledges of economy to reduce the expenses
of the Government. If the Government
can be conducted upon ail expenditure of
$117,000,000, it will be an economical admin-
istration ; it will be no more per head than in
the time of James Buchanan. If you make a
due allowance for the difference between gold
and paper, it will reduce the expenses of onr
Government to less than they were before the
war. But in order to maintain these estimates
we have to keep our expenditures within the
Ihnit allowed us of $117,000,000. I ask you,
sir, with your familiarity with the course of
legislation this winter, whether this is likely to
be done? We cannot reduce this amount in any
item except one. This $117,000,000 includes
appropriations for public works amounting to
$22,338,000. That may be diminished by the
action of Congress ; but is there much prob-
ability of it? That covers all the class of
expenditures called public works, filling some
thirty pages of your annual estimates, includ-
ing the harbor and river improvements, forti-
fications, arsenals, navy-yards, custom houses,
court-houses, and an infinite variety of expend-
itures.
If this item is reduced to a considerable
extent, it will more than be made up by other
causes of expenditure. Already the session
has developed a tendency to embark in new
enterprises, or rather to carry on old schemes
now renewed. It has been proposed to in-
crease the pension list by $6,000,000, and the
bill for that purpose passed the Senate with
scarcely any debate. We have also passed a
bill increasing the expenses of t.he mints
$150,000, or throwing away, as I think cause-
lessly, about one hundred thousand dollars.
This does not include any amount for claims
that may be allowed by the Committee on
Claims and the various committees of Con-
gress. My honorable friend from Indiana
[Mr. Mouton] has a bill for the payment of
interest to the States, which cannot cost less
than $7,000,000 if it should pass. My friend
from Nevada [Mr. Nye] rather objected to
my postponing the Sutro tunnel bill until a
more favorable opportunity. He wanted to
bore through the mountains under the Coin-
stock lode at an expense of $3,000,000. We
have subsidies proposed for every conceivable
object in the world—building telegraphs and
railroads, and assisting steamships—almost
every conceivable project, now pending on
the Calendar. We have San Domingo, which
at any rate, if it is acquired, will take from
fifteen hundred thousand to two Million dol-
lars, perhaps more.
Mr. SCOTT. That is to make us rich,
though!
Mr. SHERMAN. I know, but that is m
the future. We have to pay the principal out,
and get the interest back, 1 suppose. We have
innumerable plans for the increase of salaries.
We have propositions to add to the expenses
of the Government as multifarious as the
plagues of Egypt, but not a single proposi-
tion, so far as 1 know, to reduce the estimates
made by the Secretary of the Treasury.
If, therefore, I assume that this Congress
will not increase the estimates" proposed by
the Secretary, I assume a very doubtful prop-
osition. I should be very glad indeed to com-
promise on a moderate increase upon his esti-
mates of expenditure. Here is, therefore, the
sum of $309,000,000 that must be raised. How
can you do it? How is this money to be col-
lected from the people but by taxes? Let us
look at our sources of revenue and see where
they stand. In the same report I find the
receipts estimated by the Secretary of the
Treasury. I ask the Secretary to read that
estimate.
The Chief Clerk read as follows;
Estimated receipts for the year ending June 30,1872.
From customs  ^fi'418'uuO
From internal revenue..  lJ>,41t>,0JU
From sales ol public lands, 
From miscellaneous sources  16.uw.wu
Total  8320,418,000
Mr. SHERMAN. Including the income tax,
which is a part of this aggregate, the Secretary
estimates that we may receive from all sources
$320,418,000. Now, let us look at that for a
moment. How are these estimates made up?
The estimates from customs are made up first
by taking the receipts of the last fiscal year,
allowing for a reasonable increase, about three
or four per cent., which experience sho«vs the'
gradual growth of our country would authorize
to be added to the former returns, then deduct-
ing from that aggregate the amount of duties
that have been repealed, and that gives you
the basis of the estimate, $175,000,000.
It must be remembered that this estimate
was made on the basis of receipts in a very
fortunate and happy year, under circumstances
which favored the increase of our commerce
and trade. Any fluctuation in that trade will
at once reduce those estimates. I remember
that we were legislating in 1857 in the House
of Representatives to scatter the money' in tha~
Treasury, and the very next year there came
a revulsion which swept away our surplus, and
we were compelled to borrow money, before
we got through with it, at the rate of ten per
cent, perannum. I take the estimate from cus-,
toms to be practically true. This month the
receipts are largely in excess of the estimate
simply because large numbers of vessels and
large numbers of cargoes were landed, and
goods put in warehouse and retained there till
the new law took effect, in order to avail them-
selves of the benefit of lower duties. The
receipts for this month, therefore, are very
large ; but the most sanguine cannot expect
that the estimate of the Secretary can be in-
creased, and I doubt very much whether now,
in the present stringent state of the money
market, his estimate would be maintained by
any officer of the Government.
In regard to the internal revenue, I have
here a statement showing the items, and we
will see how they are likely to be affected'by
the present condition of trade. I will ask the
Secretary to read this official statement, show-
ing the items which make up the estimate, and
I should like to call the attention of my friend
from Pennsylvania and ask him to add to this
list it" he-can. This is'the official statement,
made within a day or two, of the probable
receipts of the next, fiscal year:

Mr. SCOTT.. Will the Senator from Ohio
permit me to state that that is the same esti-
mate we had in the annual report.
Mr. SHERMAN. The same estimate, but
it has been revised within a short time.
Mr. SCOTT. There is no percentage added
to the receipts last year in that estimate,
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senator is mistaken
about that. These items are all increased.
For instance, last year we did not collect so
much on any one item, except the income tax,
as is now contained in this list.
Mr. SCOT 1'. But on spirits, tobacco, and
fermented liquors, is the_ percentage of in-
crease we had in the previous year added for
this year?
Mr. SHERMAN. I understand it so.
Mr. SCO'J'l'. Twenty-three, thirty-four, and
four per cent., respectively?
Mr. SHERMAN. Eifty-hve million dollars
are now estimated on spirits, $31,000,000 on
