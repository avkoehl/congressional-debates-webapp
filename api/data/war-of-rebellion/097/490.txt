Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have sent a force to Ford's Station (between here and Lynchburg), and will advance along the railroad toward Ford's road, where the Fifth Corps is going in. I am destroying the railroad from Ford's Station up toward Petersburg (Ford's Station, marked "A. Ford's on map, and depot is four miles toward Burkeville). I have ordered Custer to push to his front from Seymour's house and strike the railroad. Gregg has not come up yet. Will push him in with Custer. Look out for my force on your left.
