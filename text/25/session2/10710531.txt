tlement as a colony more than a century and a hal f ago, while
other btates, only born as it were but yesterday, already sur
pass what South Carolina was, or ever has been, m fie happiest
and proud st days oí iier prosperity To v-ha* cause can these
astonishing resale )e attributed, other h<m to the unju&t and
unwise kgWat on ol Oongiess, by winch the sectional interest
of one portion of out common country his been fos ered at the.
expense of another? I consider the pnvilege eiij >yed by ti e
pincha, ers f the puolic lands, m bung exeinp ed nora a land
tax foi five yeais af er the purchase, to be orte of these canoes
To this may it ad led the liberal stipu'a ions, tn the part of
Congi ess, m i & agreement wnh the new States, on their admis
sin i mo  the Union, besides many acts of partial legislation not
embraced m that agreement such as a reduction m the mini
mum price of the public lands and the large donations of iai'ds
and appropriations of money, iron time to time, for their
seminaries of learning and objects of internal improvements
It is evidently to such causes operating as the most powerful
inducements to emigration from the old States to the new, that
t lera id die no of the ope, and the unrivalled j.ro'-peiity of
the othei, are wholly to be ascribed
Ifl am cor e"t in the views I tave taken of this subject, the
conclusion follows irresistibly that this Government has not
only exceeded us powei*, in tsbaigam with the several fetales
of the West but that the effect of i s geneial pul cy, with re
gard to the pubhe lands, his proved in the highest o>giee pre
judicial to the common welfare of im- I ruled S ates and also
to the spo<na! ínteres of the old States and ftomconsidf ations
of expediency if from no ether ought n be immediately
changedj so as to be moie in accoid met with the sound pnnci
pies of common honesty and rqoa' j uticc
But admi ti \g to*3 fact, that this Government had the power
to make the bauain it ltd with the Western Mates, and that
tach of ihe p iti a was solemnly bound toj fu fii itb engage
me <- wbitiev r might be the con«eqi enct« sil! con tn i that
no Author a-v-opuuirtiio ioi t! e Cumbeiland r< udcau be de
mantled u )on the faith of that compact ihe only giountl
upon which this demand could be piediratel is die s ipul turn
of Congress to appiy th*. two per cent fund name 4 m the com
pact to the purposes of Ia>mg oat and making roads leading to
the Western Stale*  Thi<* is the full extent of the undertake
on the part of Confess with regaid to roada, the obligations to
perform which have long since been d scharged, and again and
again ledisthaiged ebpeually so far as Ohio, Indiana, and
Illinois, aip con"orned
We have be«n told by the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mi
Underwood 1 who has taken the pains to make the calculation,
that thQ Cumberland r">ad has already cost tne Government
over £7 000,000 The first one hundred and thuty two miles of
this road, before it^ cessi n to the ¡Sutes thiough which it
passes had co=t the Government according to a statement of
dip present civil engineer, $2So30?4 which is mire thin

of the 23d í oocrre=s under tli" head of Cumberland Road I
f n 1 it stated by a gentleman frnn Alabama, (Mr McKinl^y )
then a membei of the House, w wt to t! is day sun Isuncontra
dieted, that the whole amount of the two per cent fund an mg
fiom landssoid within the limits or Ohio was only ©371,251
If this be true wi'h regard to OMo, it is leasonable to conclude
that the whole amount of the two percent fund in the States of
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, can never exceed S2 000 000, yet this 
is the only fund to which the Goverrment can look foi a íeim
bursempnt of the $450 000 now asked foi m the 111, at, well as
the $7,0   000 already expended
Mr Speaker I feel too much exhat «*ted, owing to the feeble
state of ray health, to say what I had intended and must, theie

pTprc <i giant of power "to pnvide for the common delinee
and genetdl welfere ,J Thus wis a powerful pauv foimed
based up m iltt pimnples of plundei and a division of thf1
spoils    This unholy alliance of sectional interests was soon
organized into a system, and called by the imposing name of
"America's "   One of the impertant features of this system
wa^ an act of Cordless, passed in 1324, authorizing the Presi
d*mf to appoint a coips of xiivil engineers to oe exclusively em
pi >yeü m making surveys, plans, and estimates, of the routes of
such roa s and canal* as may be deemed of national im-
portance, in a commercial and military point ol v lew, or neces
saiy for the transpoi tatiou of the mail, and report the same to
Congress    To give stahihty to this sys em, th.s corps of civil
engineers was mcoip rated by the act of its creation into the
very frame of our Government, by its attachment to the War
department,  with an appiopnation of $30,000 to defray its
expenses
llow thi-5 system worked, and to what extent n was carried
dunng the f>ui years of Mi Adamb a administration, is too ie
cent and well kt own to be foigotten With an increase of the
taiifF, there was a corresponding inci ease of expenditures upon
works of internal improvements, until, in 1S28, they both reach
ed a pnmt of extravagance and oppiession that could n   longer
be t.n lured by tl it poition of the country tha- paid an -equal
shaie of the taxes, and received nothing m teturn either in the
shipe of a bounty or by the way ofdi'-buisetnents
To reform the«e crying ab^se% and brine back the Govern
ment to the onlv safe and good old Republican standard of strict
consti notion ai d economy, General Jackson was elected to the
Presidency At the time of his Uertun, the rage for internal
improvements had run so high under the auspices of the civ 1
engineer coipsand die general welfare doctrn eof Ml Adorns,
thaL theie were then bills reponed by the Committees on In

are at the same time to be aide I the e= imatt d expenses of
such improvements as had already been -uiveved by the corps
of civil engineers, and repoited to Congress, amounting to
$4G 000 000 [Here Mr C wa& interrupted by the gen ieman
trom Virginia, (Mr Mmccr ) who saidhefe't himself bound to
coi recta i error into which the Fe i leman from South Caroli
na had fal en, an 1 which he had heard be ore repeated As
chairman of the Corymittee on Internal Improvements he
would undeitake to say that at no time have bills lor internal
impiovement been leported contairmg appropriations any
thing like the amount is stated 1
Mr V remai ^ed Ido not vouch foi the tiuth of the state
ment I have jist made ui t n tht high authority of President
J ck=oi, n some uf hi ofhcial communications to Congress
That I have «etn such a statement m «ome one of his annual or

having male a memonnVum oi it at ihe time, which I still
have m mv pas ess on Hu whe her the s a etnent be strictly
correct oi not, it i  no i oie than what mis'h have been lea
sonablv expected fr i the pievailing dicuircs of that day,
when the idea of any con^ti u innal lt^trunt upon the power
of Congress to rai^e and approptiat*1 monev v\as utterly repu
dialed, while he who daitd to deny oi even qm^uou the right
of a majonty to do whatever might be deemed for the comm in
defence and general welfare, was esteemed and pronounced
"ineffably stupid " We may safely venture to assert, with
out the iear of contradiction, that, under an Administration
acting upon the^e pimciplts, as much was done in the way of
mtet nal impi ovement* and exoi hitant taxation as the condition
of the countiy and the ¡state of the finance* would allow
Although I cannot congratulate t p country  upon the work
of tetienchment and reform undci the late Administra n n, yet
I am disponed to conclude that some good hao been effected by
the late JLxecutne, thiough the exeicipe of his veto power, in

He commenced by saying that his col league [Mi UseKRWOooJ
and himselfdiSered widely on many queetion      That on tfeie
subject his colleague was for some general and equal system,
w hile he was «tte ly opposed to any general sye em as unjust,

t cular system,  and he went so far as to eay he would be  n fe.
v ir of another which might bepropo°ejto connect theSouthem
seaports with the interior West      Now, Mr P said, he would
prefer the vote of his colleague [Mr Unu^rwood] to Jitsspeech
The one is with usinweory, but against us lu practice, whik-
the other gives «3 the reverse     The one gives us a theory

in part for thppatttcutar welfare, thus  turntngthe Constitution
upside down      If his practice weie as good as h-s sentiments,
he would have nothing to complain ol      The gentleman [Mi
Calhoon] has also verv pi uden ly thought proper to? declare
h s sentiments on the tariff— he is utterly opposed jo anv pio
tective tariff, upon principle, as unjust to others and injurious
to Kentucky, and that this is the sentiment of his State      Mr
P returned the gentleman his thanks for these manly sentí'
mentó, and hoped that he should not hcrearter find him appl>
ins the same theory to th t subject ihat he hal done to internal
impiovenents, tlaihe would not be found pgaiu&t. all general
tariffs, but for any paiticulai one that might be proposed, he
hoped he would notie'am his theory and then go for any judi
cioui= tariff      The gentbman h id also alluded to anothei deli-
cate subject, on which he uttered some high sentiments in rela-
tion to Kentucky beins a border ¡state, ard that she might again
be re chn tened the dark and bloody land    He defined his posi-
tion nobly upon this point   but Mr  1* was at a loss to un ler

South to rady and defend
Butthe^entiemvaCMi P continued) had given o reason foi
suppoiting this bill, which was a iont"l ng ne «aid that true,
no paitoithe road would 11m through Kentuckv, yet it un
along, not far fiom her bolder, turougb three States, and it
was well known that retail stores would have to be erected to
supply the workmen and contractors, and that these would be
supplied in part fiom Kentucky and thus she wonld icceive
the dnppings Now, Mr P said he had heard, under the old
Constitution, in North Carolina, when hei negroes were allow
ed to vote, that they could be bought wnh diams, hut tin* was
the first time that he had ever heard of a whole State, and such
a State, too, witn as In ave and heroic a ppople as evei v,ent
to battle and to victoty in any age or n any co muy, being
dngaed up befoie the shambles of grog shop , and her gallant
sons upon Jua floor actms Oo auctu neeiej where whole States
and sections were to be bought android This was doing m
justice to his *?tite
[Here Mr  Calhoon explained, and aid he had denied that
this motive was to influence Kentucky in her vote, but he had
meiely mtioduced this view to "how that she was actually m
teresied in the appropriation as supplies would have to be fui
nished from Louisville and < her towns, «fee
I Mr Pickens continued and-aid ptrhap«hehad u&edstronger
lar guage than the gentleman had used but that he had expiess
ed his idea    Now upon this pe ml tie (Mr P ] wa^e'al tohear
the excellent speech of the Repletentauve fiom Louisville,
{Mr Gpaves,] who certainly ought to know the interests ofhi^
constituents    He returned his than1 « to Mr Ci  foi hi  well
expieseed sentiments, and alpo for his ^ ote upon thi** bill    Up
hoped it indicated a new state of dungs      But the gentleman
iMr  Calhoon] had veted, andwts against the appropu aoñ
lot this road last y eai, and now gives a¡s his reason for that op
position, amongst othei jeasons, that there was then a majority
ofsome thirty vote  in mi* Hou^efoi Mr Van Buren, and lie
then f.ared that'he maney would beumuptlv spent to pvu
