HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MILL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., May 17, 1865. (Via Montgomery.)

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

There are three or four good boats on the Apalachicola capable of carrying, between them 350 tons, of freight all the year round. If you can deliver that amount of freight every six days at Apalachicola, I can therefore get it to my command. I shall be greatly obliged to you if you will make arrangements to send me hay and oats by that line.

My command must suffer, unless this can be done, till the Chattanooga and Atlanta Railroad is open.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
