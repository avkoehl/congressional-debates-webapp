THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
of Managers, on the 13th of March, after hav-
ing heard Burleigh's testimony read, whether
it was not true, and did you not say it was all
true ?
Answer. Yes, sir; I did. I said that both
his and Wilkeson's was true, because what
they testified to I said I had no doubt was the
fact.
Question. Now, why do you say Burleigh's
testimony is not true when he says that you
tokl him that the arrest was the cause of your
change ?
Answer. That I do not think I told him.
Question. And the only reason you have for
thinking you did not tell him is that you think
you must have come to the conclusion before
you were arrested?
Answer. I did ; certainly.
Question. But you cannot tell us when you
did come to that conclusion from any act of
memory of yours?
Answer. Not the particular moment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. If the parties
are willing to pause here, as it is now five
o'clock 
Several Senators. Get through with this
witness.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I would move
an adjournment, not otherwise.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. We shall be wholly
under the direction of the Senate. We have
no objection on our part.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from
Maine moves 
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I do not make
the motion unless it suits the convenience of
parties.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I will go on. [To
the witness.] Now, then, General Thomas,
when you came to the solemn conclusion to
use force after solemnly thinking of the matter,
did you believe in your own mind you were
carrying out the President's orders?
Answer. No ; quite the reverse.
Question. Then when you came to that con-
clusion you believed you were going to do it
against his orders, did you ?
Answer. Not in accordance with them, cer-
tainly.
Question. Then, although you had told him
the day before that you would obey his orders,
you came to a determination to do quite the
reverse, did you ?
' Mr. STANBERY. lie has not said that.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I am asking him
if he did.
The Witness. Repeat that question.
By Mr. Manager Butler:
Question. You say that you came to the sol-
emn determination to use force, and you meant
to do it, quite in reverse of the President's
orders ?
Answer. I said no such thing.
Question. Hear the question. The day be-
fore when you received your appointment you
told him you would obey his orders?
Answer. I did.
Question. The first act that you came to a
solemn conclusion about was that you pro-
posed to act the very reverse of his orders?
Answer. I did not say that was in reverse of
his orders. I said that was my idea; if I was
resisted I could resist in turn.
Question. Did you mean to do that act in
obedience to the President's orders or against
them ?
Answer. Not in obedience to the President's
orders, for he gave me no orders.
Question. You mean to say that you had
come to a solemn resolution on your own re-
sponsibility to initiate bloodshed?
Answer. I said that I would, if I found the
doors locked, break them down, and I after-
ward said that when I came to think of the
matter I found that a difficulty might occur,
and I would not be the means of bringing
about bloodshed. That is what I say._

in doing what you came to the conclusion to
do by the President's order?

own act.

fied by the President's order?

possession of that office.
Question. By force?

Question. At your pleasure, by force. Now,
did you ever ask the President what you should
do?
