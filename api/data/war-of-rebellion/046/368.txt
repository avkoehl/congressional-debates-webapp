Captain W. F. NANCE:

FORT SUMTER, July 10, 1863.

GENERAL: Firing from Morris Island and Sumter at enemy's troops on Morris Island. Will endeavor to arrange the torpedoes.

R. S. RIPLEY.

General THOMAS JORDAN:

SUMTER, July 19, 1863.

Our troops have been driven back to Battery Wagner. Cumming's Point Battery has opened on the pursuers. Fort Sumter just opening. Monitors are shelling Battery Wagner. I do not think it well to send more troops to Morris Island immediately, as there are enough there to crowd the works we hold. Has General Hagood arrived? Should any guns arrive, they had best be put in position in first White Point battery.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

July 10, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy opened heavily on the southern batteries of Morris Island at 8 minutes past 5 o'clock this morning, with heavy and light guns. Our batteries replied slowly. I am without information as to the result of this attack. Colonel Rhett telegraphs that the monitors are in motion, looking as if they were about to cross the bar to take part in the action. Nelson's battalion is on its way down to the island. Other troops as they arrive are to report to Colonel Simonton.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff, &amp; c.

FORT SUMTER,

July 11, 1863 - 1.35 a. m.

Have visited Battery Wagner. Its guns are all in order.

Olmstead's battalion in position, but troops jaded, which regret, as the enemy, I am satisfied, do not intend to hold island in force.
