time, I have kept Colonel Spear waiting their arrival. General Gregg's cavalry are now at the Gurley house, and report themselves very tired from marching all night. The working party has not come yet to destroy the railroad. I have sent for Colonel Spear and will see what cavalry he can send with the others and will let all go that I can. Do you wish the cavalry to wait for the working force?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

The major-general commanding desires as soon as the railroad party come up that they be put to destroying the road, commencing where you are and working southward; that Colonel Stedman's brigade of cavalry be used to protect them during the operation, and that you send Colonel Spear to feel toward the left as you proposed, he cooperating in the protection of the railroad party when necessary.
