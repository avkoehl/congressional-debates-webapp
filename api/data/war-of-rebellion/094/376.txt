department. This is the eleventh day since we left Nashville. On account of the limited transportation allowed us, we had but six pounds per day-all that we could draw. To-morrow morning we will be entirely out of forage. We are in a very poor country indeed-sterile soil and limited cultivation, one which promises to yield very little forage. After this has been stripped by the cavalry, which proceeds us, I do not believe we will be able to get a pound for our animals, certainly not enough. If any can be gotten for the batteries, and if the movement is to be continued to the Tennessee River on this route, in my judgment it will have to be done without artillery and ambulances. Even if we are able to get there, there is no assurance that we can get forage upon our arrival unless it is sent up the Tennessee River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The information received from General Wilson, from his reconnaissance to-day, induces the opinion that the whole of the rebel army is not yet across the Tennessee River. He writes me that he will push on at 5 a.m. in the morning, taking the road to Bainbridge. I will follow him as closely as possible for the purpose of supporting him and making pursuit as vigorously as the condition of the road will allow. I beg again to call attention of the commanding general to our condition and the necessity of pushing forward subsistence and forage as rapidly as possible. I also request full instructions for the guidance of our movements when we reach the Tennessee River, should we get so far.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
