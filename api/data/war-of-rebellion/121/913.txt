[Inclosure.]

FORT MONROE, VA., May 23, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding Military District of Fort Monroe:

SIR: I report that state prisoner Jefferson Davis has been troubled since my last report with considerable neuralgic derangement of the head. Judging from its peculiarity of attack and somewhat of a periodicity I am of opinion that it is somewhat of a malarial origin. He gives indications of febrile action, though this is but slight. He has less muscular strength than heretofore and is evidently weaker. His appetite is poor, though his food is good. He sleeps better since the noise produced by the tramp of the sentinels has been diminished.

Respectfully,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., May 25, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis remains the same as at last report, and to inclose his parole of honor. He desires it be extended so he may have the liberty of the fort at night as well as in the day.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
