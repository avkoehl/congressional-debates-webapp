JULY 4, 1864.

Major DUANE:

I wish to construct a strong redoubt on the left of Griffin's line and begin to-night, and would like to have some regular engineer workmen to begin it, as it is close to the enemy and under fire. If we can make this point secure it will restrain the enemy's whole line for a long distance right and left.
