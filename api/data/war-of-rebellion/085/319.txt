I have positive information that Colonel Glenn, who was captured at Long View, about the 1st of last April, and who by passing himself off as a citizen, was afterward released, was at the time of his capture commissioned as an officer on the staff of General Cleburne and was on his way to join him. I understand he is still, or lately, at Little Rock. I recommend that he be arrested at once.
