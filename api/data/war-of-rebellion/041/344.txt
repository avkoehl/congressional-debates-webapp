mounted men, infantry and cavalry, and one brigade of Walker's-say 2,000. It was a discreditable surprise on our part. Yesterday a flag of truce went out at the invitation of the enemy, to bring in our wounded in their hands and return theirs in ours. I judge from the officers' information who went out with it that there is not yet a large force in our front, but one is gathering. I have brought all my force to this place, and will give them a fight here if they will accept, which I do not believe.

New Iberia is exposed to a raid from Opelousas, and a mounted force has been sent up the Teche 20 miles to examine that matter. The road between here and Carrion Crow has become exceedingly unsafe for small parties.

General Lee went out 18 miles toward the Mermenton yesterday. He captured 1 lieutenant and 4 men of Texas regiment that I had not heard of before. They are just from Niblett's Bluff. They report four blockade-runners, just unloaded, direct from New Orleans in the Mermenton. The names of two are Antelope and Derby. The lieutenant says that he lately saw the Harriet Lane fully equipped for sea.

I think that the force of the enemy is increasing in our front. The guerrillas are in our rear between here and Iberia. They captured a signal officer yesterday.

The blockade runners were loaded with flour and slat meat.

P. S.-General Lee was attacked by about 300 of the enemy, but he drove them off easily.

I have heard from General Lee. He went to Carrion Crow Bayou, and there found the enemy, as he reports, in line of battle, with all three arms, in force greatly exceeding his. He has, therefore, fallen back. there has been a good deal of cannonading, but not much else. All are coming in now. I have a brigade and battery about 1 mile in front of the town to protect Lee, should he have to fall back in a hurry. The result shows that the enemy is in some force, and is waiting for something-what, I cannot tell. Will it be proper for me to send a non-commissioned officer from each regiment for the men's overcoats?
