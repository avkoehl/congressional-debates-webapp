anxiously its lifting, in order to open fire on the enemy our batteries. At 6 a. m. the evacuation of the place was reported, as stated in my report of the 14th instant,* as general of the trenches.

Under very considerable privations and hardships, under the severe ordeal of long exposure to the shot and shell of the enemy without power to reply, all the various regiments, both officers and men, who have been under my orders, have deserved commendation.

Transports having reached us through a channel cut with enormous labor under the direction of Colonel Bissell, on a suggestion advanced by the subscriber, March 17, 1862, the Second Division embarked on them April 7, to cross the Mississippi, which was accomplished in gallant style, but without opposition, the gunboats Carondelet and Pittsburgh, under Captain Walker, having in dashing style silenced the enemy's shore batteries. The division marched 4 miles in the direction of Tiptonville and bivouacked, lying upon their arms. At dawn, April 8, 1862, we pushed forward, and learned as we advanced of the evacuation of Island Numbers 10, and subsequently of the surrender of the whole force of the enemy. Arrived at Tiptonville, the Second Division was detailed as guard for the prisoners of war. The deportment of the officers and men towards them was worthy of the highest praise. It was that of brave and generous men toward a discomfited enemy, and produced upon the minds of the prisoners of war a market effect. After exposure of no ordinary kind, without tents nab only partial rations, having accomplished the service assigned to the Second Division, it returned to New Madrid.

Colonel G. W. Cumming, Fifty-first Illinois, and the troops under his command, deserve marked commendation for the energy and devotion exhibited in caring for the prisoners of war and securing the captured property. Colonel William H. Worthington, Fifth Iowa, commanding First Brigade, and Colonel Nicholas Perczel, Tenth Iowa, commanding Second Brigade, showed on all occasions so much promptitude, so much attention to the health and welfare as well as instruction of the brigades under their respective commands-the camp of the Second Division exciting the emulation of the wooly army-as to prove them well fitted for their responsible positions, and inspiring the men and officers under their orders with a confidence which could not fail to prove of the highest value in an engagement.

April 12 the division embarked on transports and proceeded down the Mississippi River toward Fort Pillow, reaching a point 5 miles above it Sunday, April 13. Here reconnaissances on the Arkansas shore were pushed by Lieutenant William B. Gaw, Volunteer Engineers, with great boldness and entire success, during the 14th, 15th, and 16th, when orders were received to proceed to Pittsburg Landing, Tenn.

The general commanding will have himself observed the creditable and zealous devotion and unflinching readiness in discharge of duty evinced by the officers composing my staff, especially First Lieutenant William C. Russell, Eighth Missouri Volunteers, aide-de-camp and acting assistant adjutant-general, who to close attention to his office duties added coolness and gallantry under fire; Lieutenant William B. Gaw, Volunteer Engineers; Brigade Surg. William Varian, who, in addition to his medical duties, intelligently and efficiently performed, has at all times cheerfully volunteered his services as an aide-de-camp; First Lieutenant H. Seymour Burt, Sixty-third Ohio, acting aide-de-camp, has distinguished himself by his promptitude and gallantry; First Lieutenant Charles A
