I desire to have immediately, to be put at the work by 4 o'clock this day, 1, 000 men, who, when ready, will report to Lieutenant [John R.] Meigs, of the Engineer Corps, on my staff, for the service. If you have any difficulty in furnishing the labor, an find it necessary to obtain it or any part of it by some equitable system of impressment, give me notice to that effect at any time, and I will furnish you the military power to enforce such impressment. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BLOODY RUN, June 20, 1863.

General COUCH, Harrisburg:

Arrived here to-day. It is a better point for concentration than Bedford. It is at the terminus of the railroad, 9 miles east of Bedford. Find about 2, 500 of my troops here and at Bedford. Will have them all her to-night. Two-thirds have arrived. All badly supplied with ammunition, and no rations. It is reported that the enemy are at McConnellsburg, advancing on this place. Answer to Hopewell.
