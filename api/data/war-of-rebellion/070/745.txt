Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

Finished the bridge to-day. Another flag of truce from Sigel with supplies for his wounded to-day. He is still at Cedar Creek. His cavalry was at Woodstock last night. No demonstration to-day. I will feel him cautiously very soon. I answered his flag in such terms that he might infer that you were still in command.
