UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA, Off Newport News, Va., April 20, 1863-noon.

Major-General DIX,

Commanding Seventh Army Corps, Fortress Monroe, Va.:

SIR: A report from Lieutenant Cushing, dated at 8 a. m. to-day, informs me that the enemy has unmasked a new battery, containing some heavy pieces, by which and some infantry the Barney was sharply attacked yesterday. Supposing that the enemy is not in great force on the left bank of the Nansemond, I respectfully suggest to you the propriety of capturing this battery, as it commands the Lower Nansemond and cannot be materially affected by the firing from the flotilla.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

S. P. LEE,

Actg. Rear-Admiral, Commanding N. Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 20, 1863.

Major-General PECK,

Suffolk, Va.:

The following just received from Admiral Lee, dated 2.40 p. m.:

Lieutenant Cushing reports that the enemy is retreating as fast as possible, and that the army, by a rapid movement, may cut off one of their brigades.

S. P. LEE,

Admiral.

Respectfully,

LOUIS H. PELOUZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 20, 1863.

General DIX:

From all that can be gleaned Longstreet has asked for more troops Unless Lee wants them all he will get them. What is the total from Hooker?

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, April 20, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

An examination shows that there is great suffering here for the necessaries of life. Traders must be allowed to bring flour, meat, and kindred articles. They will buy. Report of the provost has just reached me-since your departure. Will your order a change?

PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 20, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Major Stratton reports his visit to Elizabeth City. It had been abandoned on 18th, and the gunboats were shelling the banks as they moved down the river. Country full of guerrillas.
