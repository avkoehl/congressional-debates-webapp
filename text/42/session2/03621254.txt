petitions and memorials.
Mr. CAMERON. I am requested to pre-
sent a petition signed very largely by merchants
of the city of Philadelphia, dealers in tea and
coffee, who ask that the Senate Committee on
Finance may speedily decide upon the bill
passed the other day by the House of Repre-
sentatives in relation to the duties on those
articles. They say that the trade is suffering
great losses in consequence of the inaction of
the Senate on that subject. The petition states
that there are about ten million dollars' worth
of these articles now in the hands of dealers,
which are entirely deprived of sale in conse-
quence of the impression that there may be a
change in the duties. These merchants do not
care whether the duties be continued or taken
off, but they desire that there may be speedy
and immediate action on the subject. 1 move
the reference of the petition to the Committee
on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
