Interference of Federal Officers in Elections—Mr. Wall,
SENJUE.
' center of the United States, and opposing their |
' veto to the doings of the President, to the laws
' of the Union, and to the will of the whole people "
Ata dinnei given in old Faneuil Hall, President
Adams chained the people with possessing such
" a spirit of falsehood and malignity, as to bear a
' threatening aspect upon the union of the States
'ard their constitution of Government " The
United States Gazette was of the opinion "that
Democrats weie no republicans " It therefote
says "Let the party be styled Democrats, for
1 two reasons, first, it descube^ the sort of politics
' they would introduce, and secondly, it is a name
' already disgraced, and fits the wearers " The
language of the gentleman is that of the Tories of
England when the people propose to shorten the
duiation of Parliament, simplify the qualification
of voters, abridge the expenses of elections, abolish
the small borough constituencies, abrogate the
corn laws, reform the coiporations, and reduce
the temporalities of the cleigy The same lan-
guage is used by the aristocrats of every age,
when the people awake to a sense of their danger,
and put forth their strength for the pieservation
of their liberties
The next assault m order is upon the Depart-
ment of the Post Office, It is said that there were
" no abuses in this Department until the party in
power began reform " You, sir, know that this
statement needs great qualification You well
recollect the confusion that prevailed in every
branch of this Department when it was under the
charge of Mr Meigs In 1818 there was due the
Treasury from this office the sum of £,539,844 In
1817, when the Fifth Auditoi 's office was estab-
lished, the Post Office accounts were only ad-
justed to the thud quaitcr of the year 1810, and
the accounts of postmasters were in arreáis for
thirty years In many instances pnncipals and
sureties had become bankrupt But at that time
a bankiuptcy of half a million of dollars, unsettled
accounts at the Tieasury for seven years, and
with the postmasters of the country for thnty
years, were not a very serious offense to the pub
lie morals, or " dangerous attack upon the public
liberties " They gave rise to a short report, oc
casioned a few speeches, and the whole matter
was adjusted without prejudice to Mr Monroe,
or to you, sir, as a member of his Cabinet It
was not the fashion then to bring a whole party
before " this grand inquest of the nation" for the
errors and faults of one man Let the same thing
happen now, and a long session of Congress would
not give sufficient time for the Opposition to ex
press their feelings of indignation The welkin
would ring with the cry of corruption and pecu-
lation
I do not deny the existence of abuses in this
Department when under the administration of
Major Barry He was imposed upon by those in
whom he had a right to place confidence, and that
which enriched them made him poor indeed The
West, however, have occasion to remember him
favorably for increased mail facilities, and foi
giving to the Departmentammpulsewhichsilenced
murmurs,and put at i est the question ofa branch
office beyond the Alleghames It is also to he
remembered that Congress have authorized the
settlement and payment of many of those contracts
which were pronounced corrupt by the Post Office
investigating committee The mandamus case
grew out of the refusal of the present Postmaster
General to pay th° amount of the award made on
those contracts But whatever may have been the
faults of the past management of the office, it must
be admitted that the present Postmaster General
executes his trust with distinguished ability His
errors are on the side of economy, not of lavish
expenditure
Mr Chairman, the gentleman from Tennessee
thinks there are many abuses in the public service,
but he has a grand panacea for them all It is to
operate on the political system a3 some of the late
patented medicines are said to operate on the
human system We have only to apply it, and
the whole political body assumes new life and
vigor It immediately puts on the innocent face
of youthful existence I never had much faith m
the healing qualities of many of these medicines,
and Í have still less m the gentleman s bill " to
secure the freedom of elections " it looks too
much like the old sedition ¡aw    it is a bill to cir-
cumscribe freedom of speech and of action it
makes lnteimeddlmg in elections, ¡n any wav, by
an officer of this Go^ein-nent, except to vote, "an
attack upon the puul c liberties," a high ra&de
meanor, and punishes the offender by a fine of
§1 000, íemovü from office, and perpetual diaabi'ty
to hold office fo.ever afte" But this gag is not
suffici nt The "giving office on a<*ie mentwi h
the appointee to rendei po'itical or othei service 11
elections, or otheiuisc," is punishable by a fine of
$5,000, removal from office, ind the same perpetual
disability When this, bill becomes a lav/ by con
sent of the people, they will have taken one gland
step on the high load to despotism The founders
of our liberties consideied "civil subjection as
either necessary or voluntary " These restraints
are not necessary, and it is ever to be remembeied
that the declarations of positive law are always
weak when in opposition to the will of the people
Instead of being a measure " to secure the fieedom
of elections," it grossly attacks that freedom, ay,
more, it violates the Constitution It is no part
of the duty of Congress to regulate the elective
franchise If the conduct of the officers of this
Government at elections is odious in any of the
States, let those States pass laws to prevent the
evil They have the power, and on them let theie
be devolved the responsibility of exercising it
The gentleman ought to take his bill to his own
Legislature When he does so, I have no doubt
the ywill say of it as a Colonial Governor of the
Old Dominion once said of schools and printing—
*' God keep us from both "
We have heard much of late about the " spoils
punciple " It has been most bitterly condemned
by the Opposition here, and yet they have prac-
ticed upon it in every State where they have ob
tamed the power Tney first established the prin-
ciple, and yet the gentleman says he has often
" foretold its bad effects " This may be, sir, but
it only shows that he stands alone with his party
Even in his own State, they have rewarded fi ¡ends
by giving them office, and punished enemies by
turning them out
Mr BELL said they did not remove from of
fice, and only appointed their friends to the higher
offices
Mr CRARY I speak from newspaper report,
and may be in error But I know no difference
between a high and a low office If it is an attack
upon the public liberties to remove a political op-
ponent from an inferior office, it must be an attack
upon the same liberties to remove one from a
superior station The principle is the same in
either case This principle might prove injurious,
if all our contests for power were of a personal
character As the Opposition rally more in sup-
port of men tnan measures, they ought, peihaps,
to condemn it, and not only so, but never to piac
tice it The contests of the Democratic party are
ofa different character Their motto is, and ever
has been, principles first, and men afterwards,
and they never rally around men until their pnn-
ciples are personified m them In support of these
principles they have endured buffetings and re-
proaches and btripes without number They have
submitted to be called by the most opprobrious
epithets, and all for the belief that was in them,
that they weie promoting the true doctrines of
liberty, and the real interests of mankind When
pnnciplesaremade to prevail at such a price, they
ought not to be represented and personified through
out the country by men who hate them, and labor
by night and by day, in season and out of season
to bring them into disrepute No man or set of
men can long be at the head of the Democratic
party of this country, who will allow the sentinels
upon the watch towers to burn blue lights as sig-
nals to the enemy General Washington was
light on this subject, when he said " I ¡shall not,
' whilst I have the honor to administer the Gov-
' ernment, bring a man into ary office of conse-
' quence, knowingly, whose political tenets are ad-
* verse to the measures which the Gen eral Govern
' ment is pursuing, fox this, in my opinion, would
' be a soi t of political suicide That it would em
' barrass its movements is certain " The example
of Washington was followed by his successors—
by your venerable father, and by Madison I
will say nothing as to the course of Mr Monroe,
for he came into power, and defaced the old land-
marks of party; and warriors came together, and
shook hands upon their old battle fields When
you assumed the reins rf Government, it was a
subject of frequent complaint with your friends
that you tried to buy up your enemies by offers
of politic? station It was an unfortunate move-
ment For th o and other causes, you very soon
found yoi rself " with a barren scepter in your
grisp, no son of youis succeeding " Sir, it will
evci Le found difh ult for any administiation to
manag" the sfi\.irs of Government to the latisfac
tion of tneir pait/,with the powerof political sta
tion in the hands of opponents If it does not
prove "political suicide," it will "always em-
barrass its movements "
Mr Chairman, the speech of the gentleman from
Tennessee is remarkable throughout forthepecu-
lianty of its argument It contains many a Jesuit-
ical statement—many an illogical deduction But
I will not trouble the committee with their further
consideration I leave the rest of lis fallacies to
be commented upon by those who are more capa-
ble of doing them justice
INTERFERENCE OF FEDERAL OFFICERS IN
ELECTIONS
REPOKT IN THE SENATE,
Jawumy 31, 1839.
Mr WALL submitted the following report:
The Committee on the Judiciary, to which was
referred " A bill to prevent the interference of
certain Federal officers in elections/'report*
That they have examined the bill referred to
them with the care and attention which the im-
portance of the subject demands The object of
the bill proposed in the title and preamble, is to
prevent the great powers given to the officers of tha
Federal Government, and other persons employed
in its service, from being used for the influencing
of elections which ought to be free and uncorrupt,
and us scope is very broad and comprehensive If
proposes to enact that, after the first day of April
next, no marshal or deputy marshal, no post
master or deputy postmastei, no receiver or regis-
ter of a land office, or any of their deputies oi
clerks, no surveyor gen eral of public lands, or any
of his deputies or assistants, no collector, surveyor,
naval officer, weigher, gauger, appraiser, or othel
officer, or person, whatsoever, concerned or em-
ployed in the charging, collecting,levymg, or man-
aging the customs, or any part or bianch thereof
no engineer, officer or agent employed or concerned
in the execution or superintendence of any of tb,€
public works, shall, by word, message, or writing,
or in any other manner whatsoever, endeavor to
persuade any elector to give, or dissuade any elect-
or from giving, his vote for the choice of any per-
sons to be electors of President or Vice President
of the United States, or for the choice of any per-
son to be a Senator or Representative in the Con-
gress of the United States, or for the choice of any
person to be Governor or Lieutenant Governor of
any State, or of any person to be a Representative
or member of the Legislative Department of any
State of this Union, or for the choice of any per-
son to serve in any public office established by the
law of any of the said States, nor shall any such
officer or person intermeddle in any of the elections
abo\e-mentioned, or use any means with intent to
influence or control the same, otherwise than by
giving his own vote, under the penalty of five hun-
dred dollars, one moiety thereof to the informer,
and the other moiety thereof to the United States,
to be recovered, wuh costs of suit, by any peison
that shall sue for the same, by action of debt, bill,
or plaint, in any of the district or circuit courts of
the United States, and every person convicted of
such offense, shall thereby become disabled and
incapable of ever bearing or executing any place
or office of trust whatsoever under the United
States
It is a wise and salutary rule, as well for the
expounders as the makers of a law, to consider
the old law, the mischief and the remedy The
committee believe that it is beyond all question,
that under the Constitution and the existing laws
of the United States, every citizen has " the right
of freely examining public characters and meas-
ures, and of free communion among the people
thereon," " by word, messagejOr writing," or in.
