acre to the pre emption settler Was it not, then, clearly an
appropriation bill, coming under the rule of the House, which
requites that "All proceedings touching appropriations of mo-
ney shall be first discussed in a committee of the whole
House?''
Why, the rery idea of an appropriation presupposed an ac
tion upon the revenue Did not this right of pre emption af-
fect the revenue of the country? Did the Governnent not
draw a great amount of money from the sales ot the public
lands! and if tho«e lands were sold at a price much below their
market value, would not that diminish the revenue from that
source"! If the lands were thus given up, then the bill was an
appropriation of public lands for the benefit of the pre emp
uon settlers, and therefore came within the rule lie challenged
gentlemen to show a single instance when a bill ot this charac
tar had not been first considered in committee Such was the
proper and regular course—a course dictated, not only by rea-
son, but by the rules and the invariable usage of the House,
from the time of its legislative existence down to the present pe-
no*.
Gentlemen spoke of questions of expediency; but, for his
part, he had no idea of deviating from the old safe course He
had no idea of thus disposing ol the public domain, and of leav-
ing it to the chance of having all debate cut off by the previous
question This was a bill of great importance to every section
of the country, and ought, therefore, to have a full and fair dis-
cussion in committee and in the House; and he, for one, would
not consent to a deviation from the proper course. He repeated
that a reference to a Committee of the Whole was demanded
by the rules and former practice of the House; and that to dis-
pose of it in any other way, would be manifest injustice
Mr CHAPMAN of Alabama said that he hoped the House
would not commit the bill He felt confident that neither the
rule  nor the practice of the House required that it should be
committed. The rule requires that all bills making appro-
pnatton  of money shall be commiUed,and he was wilting to ad-
mit that the rule also embraced appropriations of lands, but
this bill proposes no appropriation whatever, either of land or
money. The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Lincoln]
says that the passage of this bill is urged on the ground that the
lands are worth more than, under the provisions of the bill, the
settlers are required to pav Mr C said it was no
time to debite the merits of the bill, nor did he design
doing so at this time, but be denied, as one of its ad
vocates, that ground for its supoort, and would take issue
with the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Lincoln,] on the .
fact that the public lands were sold to pre emptors cheaper
than to purchasers at auction Mr C. said if gentlemen would !
examine the history of the sale of the public lands, they would
find Uat it «old for within a fraction as much under the several
pre-emption laws as it had on an average a', public auc
two, and that fraction above the Government price was
less than the increased cost of the auction sales,
so that \a a financial view of the question, the policy
was to allow pre-emptions to settlers. Mr. C said, that so
far from providing for an appropriation, if the bill were to
pass, much more money would be brought into the Treasury
than would be without u. He said that, instead of placing the
mettle of this measure on the ground stated by the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, the li lends of the policy had
always, contended, that as the auction siles brought
but little or no more than the Government price for the public
lands, those who had made valuable improvements thereon
at their own labor and expense, and thereby increased and
facilitated the sale of other public lands, had, according to equi
ty and common justice, a better right to buy from the Govern-
ment at the same price than the speculators at the auction
sales, who, by combinations, scarcely ever give more than 91 25
per acre.
Mr C said that hecouldnotseethe necessity for commuting
the bill He had shown thai it involved no appropriation, and
thought M was equally clear that it proposed no new principle
It proposed to revive the pre emption law of 1838 with some
amendments, not, however, altering materially any principle
then for the third or feurth time recognized by Congress It
had been discussed over and over again in both Houses
of Congress and before the people, until every one was
perfectly familiar with it. Mr S contended that it was
perfecty clear to every member, that in the present state of the
business of the session, the measure could not be acted on, if
it were refund. Besides this bill, we have many other impor
tant measures before the Douse, of general and direct interest
with a majority, which would always ride over tins, that while
he trusted the bill was favorably considered by a majority, yet
it was merely local, and directly interesting to the new States
onlv
Mr. C. said that as he considered it would be fatal to the hill
to commit it under the circumstances he had stated, he hoped
no friend of the measure would vote for the motion For his
own part he would consider the vote about to be taken as a test
vote as to its strength in the House, and hoped every member
would so consider it in giving his vote—that it was not to pre-
vent free and full discussion that he opposed commitment, far
he did not fear any debate or examination into its merits, but
to insure action at this session, which he knew would not be
had if it went to the committee
Mr. WHITE of Kentucky said this was a mere question of
reference, and the debate ought to be confined to the point. In
the first place he contended that the bill ought to go to a
Committee of the Whole, because such a course was in con-
formity to former usage of the House, as the history of every
pre-emption bill would show. But if gentlemen meant to
cast ande all former usage and precedent, and strike out into
a new path; if they intended to lose sight of all former principles
by which they had been governed, why it was hizh time that
the country! and that posterity should know it If such was
their course, it was time the people should know that the old
elements of legislation had been broken up, and that a new
light had burst fourth, and that nothing but novelty andchange
had come upon all.
The former usage precedent, and practice of the Hsuse de
manded that the bill should be referred to a Committee of the
Whole. He did not wish gentlemen to rely on my statement
of his to prove that thiscourse hal always been taken, but he
would refer to the journal of the House, and cállense any one
to produce a single instance, when a bill of this character had
not take a thai direction He appealed to facts and he was
sure these tacts would bear him out in what he had said. Was
the old'stoctnrw that the public lands were not the property
of thsGeaend Government to be revived again?
He contended that this bill did contain an appropriation, and
«ONGftESSIONAL GLOBE.
as such, ought to be referred to a Committee of the Whole, in
conformity with the former usage of the House The diffe-
rence between the Government price, and the price the land
might bring, when exposed to public sale, would be in effect
an appropriation, and a loan to the person benefited by the
pre emption If it were not so, why then the necessity of pass-
ing the bill at all He could hardly have thought it possible
that gentlemen should have asked the House to pursue such an
unprecedented course in relation to this bill
The gentleman from Alabama says this is an "old subject,
well understood, and that there is no necessity for any discus-
sion " He advances that as a reason why it bhould not be re
ferred to a Committee of the Whole But when the gentleman
says it is an old bill, I ask him if he has read it Has he ex-
amined the bill which he Bays there is no need of discussing?
If he has, does he not see that the bill la based on three new
grounds, and that it involves principles which swallow up the
quintessence of all former billsl Does he not see that it opens
the door wide, and invites every kind of abuse to walk in?
Mr R GARLAND said, in substance, that he was friendly to
the passage of the bill, and always had been in favor of pre
emption acts; and dated his support of the measure farther
back than those who were so anxious to override the rules of
the House to come to action upon it He contended that, by
the rule, it should be committed It was a proposition to dis-
pose of the public lands, through the pre emption right, at a
much less rate than they might be sold for at public auction It
was a measure, therefore, which, to that extent, affected the re-
venue. He was not, however, friendly to the bill in favor of
doing away with the former practices of the House on similar
bills
Mr WELLER said he did not believe that the merits of a
bill should be discussed on a question of reference; and for the
purpose of bringing the House to a vote, he moved the pre-
vious question
Mr CASEY inquired of the Chair what would be the ope-
ration of the previous question; whether it would bring the
House to a vote on the motion to commit the bill, or on order-
ins it to be engrossed
The CHAIR said that would entirely depend on the qaestiou
whether the bill contained an appropriation, and whetherit re-
quired by the rule to be com muted He said he had been in
formed by the Chief Clerk, that although it had been customa-
ry tocommitthe bill ts the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, in one instance the House had decided other-
wise, and the Clerk was now looking foi the precedent, but if
the bill was one which ought not to goto a Committee of the
Whole, the previous question would be on the engrossment.
If he was now called upon to decide, he must decide that the
previousquestion, if sustained, would bring the House to a vote
on the motion to commit
Mr CASEY said if the Speaker so decided that this bill
must go toCommittee of the Whole, under the rule, he should
deem it his duty to take an appeal He was aware that a for-
mer Speaker had decided that a bill making an appropriation
of land must be so referred, but this bill made no such appro
priation He hoped the Speaker would look to former deci
sions on this subiect
The SPEAKER had hoped some gen'leman would appeal
The point had been referred to him as a question of order, and
bis decision was that ii the bill proposed to give to settlers all
over the price of one dollar and twenty five cents an acre, then
it must be an appropriation bill, but if it proposed only to sell
the lands for what they would fetch, it was not an appropriation
bill.
The question being on the appeal,
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi demanded the yeas and
nays; which were ordered
Mr HOPKINS moved to lay the whole subject en the table
Mr CASEY demanded the yeas and nays, which were or
dered
Mr J AMES GARI AND moved a call of the House, and, on
that motion,
Mr WISE demanded the yeas and nays, which, having been
ordered, were—yeas 60, nays 113
So a call was refused
On motion of Mr ATHERTON, the morning hour having
expired, the House then passed to the orders of the day
Senate bills on the Speaker's table were then taken up, read
twice, and appropriately committed
The SPEAKER announced that the business next in order
was the bill to secure the freedom of el°c ions, and to provide
for the faithful administration of the Executive patronage
The question being, "Shall the bill be rejected?"
Mr BROWN, who was entitled to 'he floor, analyzed the vari-
ous provisions of the bill, and argued that it was the same in spi
nt as the bill introduced into the other end of the Capitol, by the
Senator from Kentucky, [Mr Crittendb ] and which was
rejected by that body, there being but 8 votes in favor of
its passage And the same spirit, he said, ran through
that bill and the bill, now-before the House, as ran thlough the
old sedition law The bill while it professed to be in favor of
full liberty, its object in fact was slavery in its most
odious form He appealed to his colleague [Mr Bell] whe-
ther he was willing to advance the most worthy and mest pro-
minent of his iellow citizens toa position where they would be
disfranchised—where they dared not as freemen speak out and
act out then principles He a«kcd, was that freedom which
thus tied up a portion of his fellow citizens'! Mr*B said he
would strenuously oppose this bill if it disfranchised one of the
citizens of his State, as if it proposed to disfranchise the whole
Mr B showed the effect the bill would have had, if it had be-
come a law when heretofore introduced    He said it would
have cut right and left amongst the political friends of his col
league, (Mr Bell,) in proof of which, he adverted to the fact,
that a majority of the Federal officers in Tennessee belonged to
the Whig  party,   out    of   the   postmasteis    in   the   five
county  towns   in  his  district,  three   were   furiously   and
actively   opposed   to   Mr   Van   Buren      Instead   of   the
passage of the bill being an injury to the present Adminis
tration, he  believed it would have  been  a   benefit      Mr
B   adverted to the fir«t gag bill brought before   Congre«s,
which   was  introduced   in   1791   by    way  of   amendment
to  the  first exci->e,  or  custom  house bill     He examined
the provisions and principles of that, and compared with the
provisions and principles of the bill before the House, and ar
gued that the latter, in both particulars, was more odious than
the former    That measure was reiected in that early  day of
the Republic by a vote of 21 to 37    Mr   Madison and, Mr
Giles both voting against it    He further showed the identyof
this bill, both in principle, and its provisions, with the old sedi-
tion law.   The hour of half past two having arrived, the House
took a recess
EVENING SESSION
Mr BROWN resumed his remarks, and, in the
course of his speech, referred to the political course of Mr
Bell, more particularly on the subject of Abolition He
showed, by a reference to the records, that previous to the Har-
risburg nomination, that gentleman was ultra in his opposition
to Abolition petitions, but that subsequently he had changed
his course, and gone so far as to recommend a reference of
such petitions to a committee, with instructions to report
thereon
Mr DAVIS of Pennsylvania obtained the floor He said he
did not wish to make a speech, but to save the time of the
House, and the money of the nation, and moved the previous
question, which was seconded, and,
On the question, "Shall the mam question be now put?"

So the bill was lejected.
Mr ATHERTON moved that the House resolve itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr STANLY demanded the yeas and nays, which were or-
dered, but Mr S withdrew his motion
The motion of Mr Atherton was agreed to; and the House
resolved itself into Committee of the Whole on the state of the ■
Union, Mr Banks in the chair.
Mr. ATHERTON moved to take up the Sub-Treasury bill.
Mr. WISE moved to take up the Naval appropriation bill.
The question being put on the motion of Mr Atherton.
On motion of Mr STANLY, the question was taken by tel-
lers, (Messrs Underwood and Ramsey acting as such) and re-
sulted, ayes 101, nays 64
Mr CUSHING moved to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill, but, before proceeding with his remarks, he wished to
make a suggestion to the gentleman fiom New Hampshire, (Mr
Atherton,) under whi se immediate custody the bill appeared
to be, he having made every motion for taking it up This bill
was a very important measure—indeed, it was the measure of
the Administration, and yet it had come before the House from
the Committee of Ways and Means, without any report or ex
position of their views, to show why this projet of law should
be adopted And if the gentleman fn m New Hampshire de
sired to make any explanations or expositions, he (Mr C ) was
very ready to yield the floor, to give him that opportunity.
Nay, he waB not only ready to yield the floor, but he proffered
it to him, and invited an exposition of the bill
Mr ATHERTON said he duly appreciated the courtesy of
the gentleman from Massachusetts in ihus politely offering to
yield the floor All he had to say, however, wss, that this was
not a new measure, euher to members of the House or to the
country It had been seveial times recommended by the Presi-
dent in his annual messase anil there lad been tv.o reports in
, each branch of Consress on the general merits of t e bill
I Not only so hut he would lefer to ren arks made by a senile-
manofthe 0| position the oiherday, "tlat every rrember of
this House w«« tent I ere by his con'-tuuf nte, either for or

lieved a majority of the Houte,) had now determined to tsksup
