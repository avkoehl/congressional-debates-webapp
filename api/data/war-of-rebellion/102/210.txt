Lieutenant P. McRAE,

Fredericktown:

How many men has Thompson? Has he any artillery? Colonel Hynes will start this evening with 400 men and one section of artillery. He will go by way of Dallas. Get all the information you can of the force, and you act in conjunction with Colonel Malone's forces.

Brigadier General J. L. BEVERIDGE,

Commanding Second Sub-District, cape Girardeau:

Some of my scouts are in and report Jeff. Thompson at Harrisburg with about 100 armed men and conscripting citizens; part of Bolin's men on West Prairie laying in supplies; Kitchen at home; Clark on Grand Prairie with about fifty men. Saint Francis River impossible to cross except in dug-outs; overflows the banks for half a mile, but falling. It might be crossed in five or six days.

BLOOMFIELD, MO., April 26, 1865.

Brigadier General J. L. BEVERIDGE,

Commanding Second Sub-District, Cape Girardeau:

Harrisburg is a small town of about twenty inhabitants about twenty miles from Jonesborough, and I learn this evening that Jeff. Thompson intends to make a speech to all the different gangs at or near Jonesborough on the 1st of May. I will try and have some scouts there to hear what he had to say.

Captain, Commanding Post.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, April 26, 1865.

Captain COLBERT,

Bloomfield:

A rebel force is moving northward toward Fredericktown, within fifteen miles of that place. Jeff. Thompson is reported in command. We are after them. Direct Lieutenant Grosvenor to come in the morning. You must take care of Bloomfield.

JOHN L. BEVERIDGE,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

BLOOMFIELD, April 26, 1865.

General BEVERIDGE:

Do you wish me to send Lieutenant Grosvenor by the Fredericktown road? If they contemplate an attack on this place I think it would be a good plan. I will patrol the Greenville, Fredericktown, and Cape roads to-night.

ED. COLBERT,

Captain, Commanding Post.
