in double column on the center, move rapidly to the foot of the hill, cut roads through the wood for my artillery, and there hold myself in readiness for any emergency.

Immediately after taking this position, I was ordered by you to move forward and engage the enemy wherever I should find an open space in our front lines. After passing the strip of timber in my front, my lines were deployed, and coming upon General Wood's command in line of battle, they were ordered to lie down. I was now ordered to move rapidly to the left to the support of General Thomas. The Second Brigade being in the rear and near at hand, soon received the order and moved off at double-quick. Before the First Brigade could execute the order, its right was uncovered. General Wood having moved to the left, and a brigade of infantry with a battery of artillery, driven in confusion by the enemy, [having] passed diagonally across my line, throwing my men into confusion-some of whom were crippled and otherwise injured by horses and gun carriages-caused this brigade to fall back toward Rossville. The Second Brigade moving to the left, joined General Thomas' command, as ordered, when it soon became engaged with the enemy, and after a short action, being overwhelmed by superior numbers, it was compelled to retire in some confusion. After rallying, a portion of this brigade, under Colonel Dick, for a time supported a battery, and afterward General Brannan, whom he found hard pressed. Being again overpowered by superior numbers, Colonel Dick fell back to the Chattanooga road toward Rossville.

Colonel Barnes, as ordered, joined General Wood in the morning, and was actively engaged with the enemy on the field at various points several times in the course of the day till evening, when he retired fighting. The First and Second Brigades bivouacked on the night of the 20th about a mile south of Rossville; on the morning of the 21st, marching into Chattanooga. The batteries of my command, the Seventh Indiana, Captain Swallow; the Third Wisconsin [Captain Drury's], commanded by Lieutenant Livingston, and Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania, Captain Stevens, were very active, did effective service, and suffered heavy loss both in men and materiel. Captain Stevens was killed on the 20th while bringing off his guns.

I would respectfully invite your attention to the reports of commanders of brigades, regiments, and batteries, which are herewith inclosed. My loss is 57 killed, 601 wounded, and 295 missing. I inclose lists of casualties of the separate commands.

I cannot close this report without commending to your especial notice the conduct of my brigade commanders, General Samuel Beatty, Colonel Sid. M. Barnes, and Colonel George F. Dick. Colones Barness, cool, intrepid, and judicious, has proved himself on all occasions an able commander, and has well earned promotion. To Colonel P. T. Swaine, Ninety-ninth Ohio, I gave command of two additional regiments on the 18th, to take a commanding position on our front. In posting his troops, he displayed, as I have noticed on other occasions, much judgment and skill. His conduct on the field received the commendations of his brigade commander. I commend him to your notice. In this last action I was deprived of the valuable services of my chief of artillery, Captain L. H. Drury, he having been wounded in battle on the 13th. The commanders of my batteries, Captains
