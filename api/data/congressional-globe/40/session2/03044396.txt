Secretary of the Navy of the claims of all the

steam machinery, and that pursuant to that
act the Secretary of the Navy appointed a na-

in question, and that it appears that the pro-

formed to in the findings of the board ; and
Congress having neither the time nor means
for the careful legal investigation which the
importance of the subject demands, to relieve
it from the further consideration of the sub-

the contractors, the resolution provides the
claims for building vessels of war and steam

approved March 2, 1867, be referred to the
Court of Claims, which is hereby vested with
jurisdiction under that act, whose duty it shall
be to investigate and determine the claims of
the several petitioners upon the principles of
that act, and its finding is to have tlie same
force and effect as any other judgment of the
Court of Claims, provided that no claim shall
be so referred under this act in favor of Secor
&Co.; Perrine, Secor & Co.; Harrison Loring;
the Atlantic Works, of Boston; AquillaAdams;
M. F. Merritt; Tomlinson, Hartupee &Co.; or
