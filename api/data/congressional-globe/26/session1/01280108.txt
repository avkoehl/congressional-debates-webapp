HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Wednesday, January 8,1840.
Mr. BRIGGS said it was stated on the journal
of yesterday, that after the suspension of the rules,
on ihe motion of the gentleman from South Caro-
lina to introduce his resolutions referring the tes-
timony relative to the New Jersey contest to the
Committee of Elections, he subsequently moved to
modify the same, to which the gentleman from
Virginia [Mr. Rives] is made to object. It is a
mistake of the Clerk in making up the journal.
Certainly every gentleman has the right to modify
his own ref olution. Mr. B. moved to strike out
that part of the journal.
Mr. RIVES said he found he was misunder-
stood in making the objection, and hoped he would
be excused by ihe House in making an explana-
tion. He was of the opinion that the gentleman
from South Carolina had net the right to amend his
resolution in any one respect whatever. He is re-
ported as having objected to the amendment of the
gentleman from Tennessee. It was not the fact.
He objected to the modification cf the gentleman
from South Carolina, because the rules had been
suspended for a particular resolution. Mr. R.
moved to amend the amendment of the gentleman
from Ma<wachusetts, as follows:
"After the suspension of the rule, Mr. Campbell
proposed to modify his resolution so as to enlarge
the powers of the committee. To this motion Mr.
Rites objected as being out of order, the mies
having been suspended foi a particular object, em-
braced in the words of the resolution. Action had
taken place relative to the resolution as soon as the
Speaker declared the rules suspended for its recep-
tion; and that it could not then be altered, excupt
by general consent, or by vote of the House; for
the mover of the resolution had no more control
over it, at that particular stage of the proceeding,
than any other member who had voted w.th a view
to its adoption.''
The CHAIR stated that the question on the
amendment to the amendment would be first
taken.
Mr. BRIGGS said he had made the suggestion
to amend the journal because he thought it did not
state the fac's; and that the motion to spread on the
journal rhe declaration of members was irregular
and unusual. He was understood to be opposed
to the amendment.
The CHAIR aga:n stated the question.
Mr. RIVES said he had refrained from taking
up any of the time of the House, and did not wish
to do so now; he merely wanted te place himself
tight on that subject, and had presented the amend-
ment for that purpose. To save time and discus-
sion, however, he would withdraw his amendment,
and consent to that of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts.
The question was then taken on Mr. Briggj's
amendment, and carried.
Mr. COOPER of Pennsylvania submitted a
resolution, which was read as follows, for the in-
formation of the House:
Ruo'.ved, That the Postmaster General be di-
rected to communicate to this Hou e the late ar-
rangement made for the transportation of the mail
between Philadelphia and Washington city; over
what route the same is carried; whether ihe dis-
tance by said route is greater or less than under the
former arrangement; whether the time required for
its transportation, between the said places, has
bÂ«en increased or diminished by the change; whe-
ther the communication between New York and
Boston, and the South and Southwest, has been
facilitated or retarded thereby, and whether the
price paid for the transportation of the same has
been increased or diminished, and what is the
amount of the difference.
And whereas it is alleged, to the great discredit
of the Government, that the Eastern mail has been
clandestinely and fraudulently transmitted by the
agents of the Pos' Office Department, from Phila-
delphia to Baltimore, by the cars of the Philadel-
phia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Compa-
ny, notwithstanding the Postmaster General has
discontinued his contract with the said company
for carrying the said mail: Therefore,
Re$olved, That the Postmaster General be re-
quired to communicate to this House whether it is
true, as alleged, that such fraud has been commit-
ted upon the said comrany by any officer or agent,
person or persons, connected with, or in the em-
ployment of, the Post Office Departount; and if so,
whether such officer or agent, person or persons,
have been removed or discharged; and that a full
statement of the facts relating to the transaction be
communicated to this House.
Objection being made to the reception of the
resolution at this time,
Mr. C. moved to suspend the rules to enable
him to offer it; but before the question was put,
Mr. DUNCAN asked if the resolution was in
order, or could be moved, when another member
was entitled to the floor, upon another subject.
The CHAIR understood the gentleman to have
yielded the floor for the purpose; to which
Mr. DUNCAN, however, dissented and claimed
the floer.
The resolutions of Mr. Campbell of South
Carolina, to refer all the testimony in relation to
the New Jersey disputants to the Committee of
Elections, and Mr. Bell's substitute for said reso-
lutions, declaring that the Democratic claimants
have not the right to be sworn, <fcc. being the ques-
j tion before the House,
Mr. DUNCAN, who was entitled to the floor
I upon said question, concluded his very able speech
in review of the whole subject. He adduced many
facts, including statements of the polls, and the
message of the Governor of New Jersey, in proof
of the fraud which had been commit ed to deprive
the people of that State of their legitimate represen-
tation, and in justification of the course the House
of Representatives had pursued in setting aside the
claimants who held the certificates. [His remarks
will be published at length hereafer.]
Mr. BOTTS having obtained the floor, at the
solicitation of several members, moved that the
House adjourn; bnt withdrew it at the request of
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee, to enable him to
make a motion to refer so much of the report of
the Secretary of War as relates to Military Affairs
to the committee on that subject; and subsequently
to Mr. Sergeant, to make a motion to refer cer-
tain Senate bills, on the Speaker's table, to appro-
priate committees; but both motions having elicited
debate, and objection having been made to said
references, before the same was disposed of,
Mr. BOTTS renewed his motion for adjourn-
ment; which was put, and carried, and
The House adjourned till to-morrow, 12 o'clock.

tains of steamboats, was referred to the Committee

Mr. CLAY of Kentucky presented two peti-
tions__one from a number of the citizens  of the
city and county of Philadelphia, and the other
from citizens of Bridgeport, Connecticut, all of
whom are engaged in the coach-lace making busi-
ness. They say that the duty on worsted coach
lace is sufficient to enable them to manufacture it
cheaper than it can be imported; but that silk lace,
by a recent judicial decision, is permitted to be im-
ported duty free, contrary, as they say, to the spirit
of the law. They therefore pray a modification of
the law. The petitions were referred to the Com-
mittee on Manufactures.
Mr. CALHOUN presented a petition from the
vestry of St. Philip's Church of the city of Charles-
ton, praying a remission of duty on an organ, im-

Mr. BUCHANAN presmted a memorial of a
number of American citizens residing in Malaga,
in the Kingdom of Spain, representing that Ameri-

in the places for burial there, but are compelled to
j be carried to Ihe shore of the Mediterranean,
| where ihey are suffered to remain. They pray that
Congress may make an appropriation which will
enable them to procure a place of burial for their
dead. The memorial was referred to the Commit-
tee on Commerce.

S. Roulett; which was referred to the Committee on
