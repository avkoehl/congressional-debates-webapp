ciency to depend upon the circumstances of space
in our own vessels, and the distance of an enemy
m case of action, which, b"ing variable in ihem-
selves, then relative efficiency would probably be
e&timated differently by different individuals.
A copy of the report of the board is hereto an-
nexed.
Commodore T. A Catesby Jones having pre-
sented to the board his individual views m a letter,
an extract of such parts ot me same as relates to
the subject of the resolution, is also annexed.
Upon a late report that an atrocious piracy had
been committed near our coast upon the packet
Susquehannah, our officers and seamen, with great
alacriiy, volunteered their service  to go in pursuit
of tho supposed puate.
jn performing mi  duly they encountered unusual
haidships and privations, foi which their usual pay
and emoluments form no adequate < ompensation
I would respectfully suggest the propnety of making
provision by law for giving suitable iewds in
th'S case, as well as m like cases, wh ch may here-
after occui.
In my annual report of Dpcmber, 1835, I took
the liberty of suggesting the necessity of establish-
ing a national foundry, for the purpose o'" casting
cannon, shot and shells, as well tor (he Army as
Navy. This subject I beg leave to bring to your
notice as one of great importance.
An establishment tor the manufacture of powder
for the Army and Navy is one of nearly equal im-
portance. It is believed that under a joint board of
officers of the Army and Navy, these objects
mav be effected with great advantage to the
country.
It is my duty to state that the building occupied
as offices of the Navv Department, is not such as
to affoid the pioo i and convenient ?ccommoda-
tioiis to ¡h" orbe is an I clei'vs employe I T e
want oí rooms tor the documents and voucher  of
the Department has made it necessary to crowd the
halls and passages of the building with wooden
boxes filled with paper .
This a is much to the danger from fire, to which
the building, with its valuable content ,, is daily
exposed. It is hoped measures may be adopted
for extending the building, and for the safe-
keeping of the valuable records and papers it
contain :
Ey the statement marked TJ, hereto annexed, it
will appear that ot the appropriations heretofore
made for the suppression of the slave tiade, there
remained in the Treasury on the 23d of November
last, #10*763 74.
The necessary references to papers and docu-
ments connected with this report, will be found in
a schedule hereunto annexed
All which is respectfully submitted.

Post Office Department,    ~)
December 4, 1837. j
Sir: On the 1st of July last the post routes of
the United States in operation were, as nearly as
can be ascertained, 141,242 miles in extent, and
the annual transportation of the mails upon them
32,597,006 miles, viz
On horses and m suIkcvs    -   -   -    11,999,282
In stages and coaches     -   -   -   -    18,804,700
In steamboats and railroad cars    -      1,793,024
The increase  of routes in operation duung the
preceding year was 22,978 miles, and of the annual
transportation 5,018,620
from the 1st of January next, the post routes
covered by con lacts will be at least 142,877 miles
in length, and the rafe of annual transportation
upon them 36,228,962 miles.
The number of post offices in the United States
on the 1st of July last was 11,767, ,h wing an in-
crease of 676 within the preceding year
The nambeV of post offices established wiihir>
the year was 956, the number discontinued 280,
and the changes of postmasters 2,235 
, The namber of post offices on the 1st tmstant
was 12,099.
The postmasters generally perform their dunes
with admirable fidelity and precision.
The number of contiactors in the mail service
during thelast yearwa  1,682 Of these, 430have
been fined more or Jess for various delinquencies,
and the aggregate of unes imposed, and deductions
made, during the year, is $41,705 95.
Most oí the contractor  have always been ener-
getic and lauhful, and, among the rest, iheie has
been, w,thm tne last }ear, a very sensible improve-
ment.
The revenue of the Depattment foi the last vear,
including an estímale foi deficient
returns, was             -           -           $4,137,056 59
The expenditures, including an esti-
mate of demands not adjusted, was 3,380,847 75
Excessoí íevenueover expenditure     $756,208 84
The mciease of the whole year was 20i per cent
o\er the revenue of the preceding year, producing
$228,834 53 more than was estimated.
Duailed statements with estimates for the com-
ing \ear will be la.d before Congress m obedience
to the act of 1836

Total funds on hand

In consequence of the failuie of Congress to re-
duce the postases at the last annual session, ar"

Of course the whole intermediate, adjacent, and
more remote legions of the Union, are benefited by
this increase of expedition.
The advancement of the Department in other
respects is equally satisfactory

Revenue                 -           $3,993,576 $4,137,056
In 1835, the Department was laboring under an
extraordinary debt of $600,000, m 1837, it has asur-
plus of $300,000.
Efforts have been made to organize a great mail
hnefiom New York, through Philadelphia, Balti-
more, Wheeling, Columbus, and Cincinnati, by
land, and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, by
Louisville, Memphis, Helena, Vicksburg, Nat-
chez, &c to New Orleans Between Cincinnati
and Louisville a steamboat mail now runs daily;
from Louisville to New Orleans it now runs thrice
a week undei a recent contract, and will run daily
after the first year, from Baltimore to Cincinnati
the mail has been greatly expedited, and nothing is
wanting to complete the plan but a contract wilh
the railroad eompimes between Philadelphia and
Baltimore, of which there is a fair piospett. It is
anticipated, that when ihi  line shall be m full ope-
ration, it will be expedient to discontinue the Ex-
pies^ mails between Philadelphia and Cincinnati,
at least, as little can be gamed by fhem, and the
great mail n ill go from New York to New Or'eans,
by this route in about eleven days.
It is hoped the b 11 relative to the transportation
of the mail upon railroads, which passed the Senate
at the last annual session, may become a law. It
is liberal to the railroad companies, and would
probably lemove all obstacles to making contracts
with them
Por some time to come the mad transportation
will be near/y stationary. The post offices will
gieatly increase The revenue «ill rapidly ad-
vance as sooi as the geneial embarrassments are
at an end That of the last quarter was at least
nine p°r cent ov¡ r the corresponding quarter of

and for the quarter ending 30th September last over
225,000 The average may be put down at 900,000
annually At J24 cents each, their estimated ave-
rage postage, the loss to the Department on these
letters is $112 500 a ^eai
Estunatng the letter  delivered out at the same
avetase rate, it will appear that the whole number

Uiiiicl States (.'Míos- the last uii mis 29,360,992

The convenience ol the public bus.ness, and the
s°cunty of the books "ml paoers, require that a
fire-pioof building he provided fur this Deoartment
It is necessirj lh?t the clerks provided form the
appropriations of the last annual session be made
permanent
The great mciease of the number of post offices,
and m the magn tude of acct unt  fiom the old of-
fices, togetner witn the multiplicaron of contractors,
render it absolutely necess?rs to augment the force
of the Auditor's office
I take gieat pleasure in saymgr, tint more faith-
ful, devoted and efficient pubic officers than my
three assistants cannot be found, and that the
clerks generally partake of their spirit.
Some id«a m?y be formed of the amount of busi-
ness done in this Department fiom ihe ¡act, thnt
the coirmumcations of all sorts received m the
different offices, excluding the Auditor's office,
amount to a daily average of about 8G0 for the
working days, equal to 269,180 a year, the com-
munications sent, to ahcut 470 daily, equal to
147,110 a iear, and the cases actual!'- decided by
the Postmaster General to 48 daily, equal to
15,024 a year
The magnitude of the work done by the Auditor
and his c'erl-s m=iy be estimated from the f^t, that
thev examine and adjust the four quarterly ac-
counts of each postmaster, making near 48,000
accounts a year, and the accounts of each con-
tractor quarterly or oftener, making about 7,000
a year; keeping the mass of books reouired m
this service , closing  each vear the accounts of
