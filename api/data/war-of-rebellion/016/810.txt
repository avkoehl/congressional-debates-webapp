Just as they were put in position I heard, away to our left, a rushing of men. I rode down to the left of our skirmishers, and found that General Hatch's brigade was hurrying forward, not in the place where it seemed they should, but far to the left, directly over our brigade, and in rear of the left of our skirmishers.

First came the Twenty-fourth and Thirtieth Regiments, then the Fourteenth Brooklyn. As soon as the Fourteenth had arrived at a position some 15 or 20 places in rear of our skirmishers, they received the flanking fire that head annoyed our skirmishers. They immediately broke, but were rallied again. They advanced nearly to our skirmishers, when they broke and fled, and were not rallied again. At this moment my horse was shot under me, and by the time that I had disengaged myself from him the advanced regiments were falling back. I immediately ordered our skirmishers to rally on the reserve, which they did as well as possible in the confusion. We fell back and joined our regiment, which was in a few paces of us, and then followed General Hatch's brigade from the woods. It seemed to me that a great mistake had been made, that General Hatch's brigade had been ordered to enter at our right, and, making an error in the direction, passed over us instead of passing to our right.
