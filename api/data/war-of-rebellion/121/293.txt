RICHMOND, February 22, 1865.

General B. BRAGG, Burgaw:

Do the U. S. authorities still refuse to receive the prisoners, not officers, at Wilmington? If so, should they not be taken off the cars at some interior point, that the trains may be used for other transportation?

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RICHMOND, February 22, 1865.

General BRAGG, Burgaw, N. C.:

Secretary of War informs me that General Grant is being urged to require a compliance with agreement on part of Federal authorities to exchange at Wilmington. He directs me to confer with you and not to bring them here unless it is impossible to receive them at Wilmington.

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General.

General BRAGG:

Will it be possible to deliver the Federal prisoners through your lines, or shall I return at once to Richmond? Please answer.
