When the historian shall write the records of these eventful days in August, 1862, no prouder record can be erected to the honor and memory of a free people than a plain, full narrative of actual realities.

The records of this office corroborate the foregoing statement, and show that 58,689 men were put into service by the State of Illinois under these two calls.

Under the call for 100-days" troops in April. 1864, preparatory to the opening campaigns of that year, the Governor of Ohio offered 30,000 men for active service "for 100 days, unless some discharged."

He ordered his troops to rendezvous in the most eligible places in their respective counties on the 2nd day of May, and to report by telegraph at 4 o"clock of the same day the number present for duty.

Reports were received the same day at 7.30 o"clock that 38,000 men were in camp, and clamorous to be sent forward. Then came the labor of consolidation, organization, muster, and equipment. by the 16th of May the regiments were ready to be forwarded.

Between the 5th and 16th of May, a period of twelve days, forty- one regiments and one battalion of seven companies, in all 36,254 men, were consolidated, organized, mustered, clothed, armed, equipped, and presented for transportation to the field.

On the 24th of May, twenty-two days from the time this Ohio force rendezvoused, all the regiments had left the State for active service.

The greatest number of three-years" men put into service in any one month under the call of October 17, 1863, was in the month of February, 1864, viz, 69,533.

The greatest number of three-years" men raised in any one month under the call of July 18, 1864, was in the month of September following, when 115,000 men were put into service.

In the months of February, 1865, pending the draft under the call of December 19, 1864, 69,000 men were put into service for one, two, and three years, of which the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin furnished 41,012, viz:

Ohio........................................... 10,984

Indiana........................................ 11,317

Illinois....................................... 13,696

Wisconsin...................................... 5,015

--------

Total.......................................... 41,012

or 60 per cent. of the entire number raised by all the States.

During the months of February and March, 1865, 136,000 men were put into service, of which the above-named States furnished 66,934, viz:

Ohio........................................... 18,783

Indiana........................................ 17,993

Illinois....................................... 22,016

Wisconsin...................................... 8,142

------

Total.......................................... 66,934

or 49 per cent. of the entire number raised by all the States during these two months.

It is proper to remark that no troops were required from Connecticut, Iowa, and Kansas under the call of December 19, 1864, for the reason that they had a large excess of credits in advance of the call, while the quotas which would ordinarily have been assigned to the States of New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island were reduced by reason of a proportionate excess of credits over former calls.
