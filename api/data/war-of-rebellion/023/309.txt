Gov. DAVID TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 11, 1862-10.10 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

GENERAL: I have just received dispatch from Governor Tod that he is ordered not to send troops into Kentucky without your special order. General Buell telegraphed Governor Morton and Governor Tod to send me troops. General Morgan asked me to re-enforce Richmond and London to protect his rear and his trains.

General Nelson, at McMinnville, through General Wood, telegraphs that the rebel Morgan left Sparta on the 9th instant with 1,800 cavalry and four pieces of artillery for Kentucky. I have no adequate force to whip or catch the rascal until the new cavalry are mounted and armed. Governor Morton promised to send four regiments this week. I have no doubt [J.

If the rebels have the 15,000 in front of General [George W.] Morgan and the 60,000 at Knoxville, as stated in his dispatch to the Secretary of War, many troops would be needed in Kentucky.
