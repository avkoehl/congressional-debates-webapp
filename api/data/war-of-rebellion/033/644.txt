HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, October 13, 1863-11 p.m.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

It is of no use for Cole to be following Brown's trail. Brown has plenty of troops. Cole should move to Sedalia, or some point where he can get information readily, and fall upon the enemy with fresh troops at a favorable opportunity.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 13, [1863.]

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis:

The Isabella left Boonville about 3 p.m. yesterday. The captain reports the rebels went westward to Arrow Rock, skirmishing at the time the boat left. Reported that rebels intended taking road to Choteau Springs. I shall send 20,000 rations on Isabella up the river, and endeavor to relieve our people. Our forces must all be up with rebels; I mean Brown, Lazear, Kelly, Cole, Crittenden, and Leonard.

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 13, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

An engine with guard were at La Mine Bridge yesterday. Reported road all right, but heard nothing of rebels. Gentleman who was in Tipton while rebels were there, reports their officers said they would be joined by another force which had gone another route. He supposed they meant the party who attacked General Blunt. They also told him Quantrill and Jackman would join them, and they would go through to Iowa. Can you furnish Major Brown, at La Mine, a company of cavalry from Sedalia? He should have some for scouting, &amp;c.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.
