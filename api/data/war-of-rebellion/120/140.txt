Bureau of Exchange, June 24, 1864.

The Federal authorities contend that it is the duty of the captors to keen a prisoner in actual custody and deliver him at either City Point or Vicksburg, and that if a prisoner is released on parole in any other way, or delivered elsewhere, the parole "is null and void" and not "binding. " As long as this is the Federal doctrine, self-defense compels us to adopt a like rule. This parole clearly comes within this rule. It is therefore declared null and void, and this officer is free to return at once to duty with his command.

By order:

W. H. HATCH,

Captain and Asst. Adjutant-General, Asst. Agent of Exchange.

There can be no doubt, on the principles and practice of the Federal authorities, that this parole can have no validity or obligation. It is null and of no effect, binding neither in law nor honor.

Secretary of War.

Order this officer to return to duty.
