guns that could be saved were taken off the field, when they were ordered off by Colonel John McCausland, who remained with them and covered the retreat, repulsing the enemy's cavalry several times, thereby saving many of our men from capture. Too much praise cannot be awarded Captain Burford and his men for their coolness and gallant conduct.

I herewith append a report of the killed and wounded of the regiment-as will be seen is very heavy, taking into consideration the time it was under fire. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith was wounded early in the action on the 9th, and as I had no information of the fact for some time after, the men were without orders for some time.

In bringing this report to a close I would call attention to the distance marched, the endurance and cheerfulness of the men, who were without blankets or clothing, some of them entirely barefooted. On the 13th instant we marched over thirty miles on miserable roads, and were expecting to meet the enemy in force. yet these men kept up and bore all without a murmur, showing a devotion worthy of the cause in which we are engaged.

I would, in conclusion, mention the valuable services rendered the wounded on the field by Asst. Surg. A. H. Stearns, who was exposed to a very severe fire while attending to their wants; also, Lieutenant Thomas G. Jarrell, Company B, of this regiment, for gallant and distinguished conduct, bringing off the colors when the color bearer and guard were all shot down.

It would make this already lengthy report too long to mention all. I will state, with few exceptions, officers and men did their whole duty.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. E. FIFE,

Major, Commanding, &amp;c.
