Colonel MURRAY,

Woodville:

Reports are made to me of the most disgraceful outrages on the part of troops along the road within 10 or 12 miles of your station. Not only is properly taken without vouchers, as required by law and my repeated orders, but property is wantonly destroyed, negro women are debauched, and ladies insulted. Such acts are said to have been committed at Mr. Clay's place, 10 miles west of you, yesterday or the day before.

If you had a party at that place at the time stated you will arrest the officer and send him to these headquarters. Such conduct is disgracing the army and is destructive of public interests.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

Colonel STANLEY,

Manchester:

Leave one company of infantry as a bridge guard. Every bridge which if destroyed could not be repaired in a few hours must have a stockade and a guard of from a half to one company.

General THOMAS,

Decherd:

Order the two brigades of Wood's division at Decherd and Tullahoma to McMinnville, starting to-morrow morning. They will stop momentarily at points along the railroad to give is security until it is repaired and guarded. Push Wagner's brigade forward promptly to within 8 miles of McMinnville for that purpose. He ought perhaps to have a battery with him.

D. C. BUELL.

DECHERD, August 12, 1862.

General BUELL:

Have any of the Mechanics and Engineers been ordered to Manchester to repair the railroad bridge to McMinnville? Colonel Wagner will march early to-morrow morning; General Wood next day. He will have to remain here to-morrow to complete the repairs to his wagons and draw rations. He will march direct to Manchester, and thence along the railroad to McMinnville.

GEO. H. THOMAS.
