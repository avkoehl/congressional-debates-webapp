Washington, at Yorktown, on the march, and on the Chickahominy, I doubt if the issue of such orders would do much good. We want a different system of accountability before want axes, and in my judgment the surest way to have them when they are wanted is to buy them in abundance and send them here. Certainly the cost of 20,000 or 30,000 axes is a very small matter to be weighed against the retardation of this army even for one day, particularly when we have water or railroad transportation to the center of our camps.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. S. ALEXANDER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

I have to-day had all the men General Hooker could furnish employed in strengthening the profile of Numbers 3 and Numbers 4., placing abatis around them, constructing magazines, and extending infantry parapet to connect with Kearny's line. The water in the ditch of Numbers 4. is about one and a half feet deep. I have also had small detail at work revetting interior slope and embrasues of Numbers 5. with sand-bangs.
