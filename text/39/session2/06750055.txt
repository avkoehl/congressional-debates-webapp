line; and secondly, the practicability of secu-
ring that objt-ct without waking the ships so
large as to preclude, by their heavy draught,
the possibility of entering the harbor of Hono-
lulu, which has a depth of water, under favor-
able circumstances, of barely twenty-one feet.
These two conditions, they allege, were found
to be inconsistent, and they therefore assumed
the responsibility of so constructing the ships
as to attain the more important objects of the
subsidy, while necessarily placing a practical
difficulty in the way of the accomplishment of
the lesser, believing this to be the only course
open to them without disregarding the main
ends of their contract, as well as the wisest
for the public interests to be promoted by the
establishment of the line. They are, conse-
quently, building ships of much greater cost, by
reason of increased size, and proportionally
more expensive to keep in service, than was
necessary to meet the minimum requirements
of the law.
Although the law, and the contract executed
in pursuance thereof, name Honolulu as an
intermediate port, the fact appears to be well
established by reliable official information,
that the laws which govern the navigation of
the Pacific ocean render it unwise, if not in-
compatible with the complete success of the
enterprise, to require the steamships to touch
at the Sandwich Islands on their passage be-
tween San Francisco, Japan, and China. This
is conclusively shown by the report of my pred-
ecessor to the Senate Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads, dated June 11, 18(56,
in which are embodied explanations furnished
by Rear Admiral Charles H. Davis, Superin-
tendent of the United States Naval Observa-
tory, respecting the proper routes to be pursued
by steam vessels navigating the Pacific ocean
between San Francisco, Kanagawa, and Hong
Kong. Admiral Davis, referring to the advan-
tages of the great circle or direct route between
China and San Francisco, so clearly defined
by natural laws, uses the following explicit
language: '"It is impossible, in establishing a
route between two continents for the improve-
ment of intercourse and trade, to overlook or
neglect such advantages as these. It is hardly
too much to say that it would amount to an
absurdity to select the models of our ships
with special reference to speed; and to propel
them through the water with engines of enor-
mous power, and then to pretermit those aids
and advantages which nature offers to us as
her own means of cooperation. At any rate, if
we are prepared to do so, we must also be pre-
pared to leave this field of enterprise at no
distant day to those who will obey the laws
governing the navigation of the great seas.
These considerations with regard to the eastern
voyage appear to dispose of the whole ques-
tion. They show that touching %t the Sand-
wich Islands on the return from China would
prolong the voyage so many days unnecessarily;
that an additional line of steamers must soon
he established, provided the intercourse be-
tween China ana America is to acquire that
importance which is confidently expected."
A careful consideration of the subject has
satisfied me of the correctness of the views
expressed by my predecessor in that report.
That the steamships of the main line between
San Francisco, Japan, and China should not
be required to touch at the Sandwich Islands
does not, in my judgment, admit of reasonable
doubt; but the conditions upon which such
release should be granted is a question exclu-
sively for the determination of Congress. A
wise and liberal policy toward a national
enterprise of this magnitude would seem to
justify the release without imposing onerous
conditions, in consideration of the increased
expenses incurred in building ships for the
service of great size and augmented speed, as
well as of the important public interests in-
volved in the success of the line.

The free delivery system is in operation in
forty-six of the principal cities. The number
of carriers employed was 863, at an aggregate
compensation of $589,236 41.
This mode of delivery has steadily grown in
favor with the public, and in several of the
large cities, where its progress has been most
marked, the local postage shows a gratifying
increase. Experience has shown its superiority
over the old system of box delivery, and the
results of the last two years commend it to
Congress as a permanent branch of the postal
service. Its effects in saving time to the public ;
in insuring the correct delivery by inducing
the habit of directing letters to street and
number ; in reducing the great number of ad-
vertised and dead letters; in facilitating cor-
respondence, especially local; in obviating
the necessity of the many fruitless calls at the
post office, are relied on to prove its advan-
tages over the old system of office delivery.
DEAD LETTERS.
The whole number of dead letters received,
examined, and disposed of during the year
was about four and a half millions, upward
of forty per cent, of which were from forty-
seven of the larger post offices. About six
hundred thousand other letters were received,
being unmailable for want of prepayment of
postage, or on account of misdirection or
illegible address.
During the year there were registered and
remailed to the respective owners, as inclos-
ing money in sums of one dollar and upward,
32,814 letters, containing an aggregate of
$244,589 99, of which number 27,948, contain-
ing $221,066 19, were delivered, being ninety
per cent. The number of letters inclosing
sums of money less than one dollar, remailed
to the respective owners, was 13,834, contain-
ing an aggregate amount of $3,052 55. Of
these, 11,175, containing $3,001 23, were de-
livered.
The number of letters containing papers of
value other than money, as deeds, bills of
exchange, drafts, checks, &c., received, regis-
tered, and returned for delivery to the owners,
was 26,610, and the nominal value of the in-
closures therein was $7,826,881 68. The num-
ber of these letters delivered was 24,053, being
eighty-five per cen.t.
The number of letters and packages contain-
ing photographs, daguerreotypes, and articles
of jewelry, was 67,016, of which 53,572 were
sent out, (containing, for the most part, photo-
graphs and daguerreotypes,) and 42,745, or
eighty per cent., delivered.
A large number of packages containing mis-
cellaneous articles, for which no owners could
be found, were sold at public auction, the pro-
ceeds amounting to $3,543 14.
I The number of letters returned, unopened,
to foreign countries during the year was 193,-
754, the amount of unpaid postage on which
was $9,879 40. The number received from
foreign countries in the same condition during
the same period was 72,440, and the amount
of unpaid postage thereon $2,039 26.
The number of congressional and official
papers returned to the proper Departments
â–  was 17,806.
The number of letters inclosing soldiers'
discharges and other military papers sent to
' the Adjutant General's Office, &c., was 8,918.
| The number of ordinary letters remailed to
! the writers was 1,746,156, being an increase
of 583,472 over the number of the same char-
j actor returned the year previous. Of these
! 1,275,845 were delivered.
j The whole number of letters of all descrip-
i tions sent out during the year was 2,093,444,
| of which 1,602,224 were delivered, being sev-
| enty-seven per cent.
j Of the number of ordinary letters sent out
; for delivery since the 1st July last, from which
time, in accordance with the law, they have
been returned free, eighty-three per cent, were
delivered, being an increase of seventeen per
cent, over the percentage delivered during the
same period of the year previous.
About 2,500,000 dead letters have been de-
stroyed during the year. Of these upward of
sixty per cent, were ordinary business circu-
lars, advertisements of lottery and gift enter-
prises, notices of corporate societies, and
tradesmen's bills; the remainder being com-
posed of letters not signed, or so written as to
be unintelligible.
An investigation into the cause of the non-
delivery of letters confirms the statement made
in the last report, that three fourths of the whole
number fail to reach the parties addressed
through faults of the writers, and it has been
ascertained that the proportion of letters fully
addressed returned from offices where the free
delivery is established is less than three per
cent. From some of these offices returns have
been received, in which not a single letter so
addressed appears without a satisfactory reason
for the non-delivery. From forty to fifty per
cent, of dead letters are returned from these
offices, and it thus appears that a more careful
attention to the details of address on the part
of writers, together with a more extensive use
of request envelopes, would materially promote
the certainty of delivery and greatly diminish
the number of dead letters.
POSTAL MONIY-ORDEB SYSTEM.
The number of money-order offices now in
operation is 766, being 347 more than at the
date of the last annual report, and measures
have recently been taken to establish 67 addi-
tional offices in the Pacific States and Territo-
ries.
The number of orders issued during the year was
243,609, of tho value of. $3,977,259 23
Tho number paid was 233,124, of the
value of    83,851,839 49
To which is to be added
amount of orders repaid
to purchasers  52,050 73
  3,903,890 22
Excess of issues over payments  $73,309 06
From the establishment of the system on
November 1, 1864, to July 1, 1865, a period
of eight months, the orders issued amounted
to $1,360,122 52, arid the orders paid and re-
paid to $1,313,577 08. On comparing these
amounts with the corresponding transactions
of the last fiscal year, it appears that the busi-
ness has,been almost trebled.
The average amount of each order issued
during the year was $16 32.
The whole number of duplicates was 1,432,
