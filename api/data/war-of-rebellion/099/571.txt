GENERAL: Pursuant to orders from headquarters Fifteenth Army Corps, I broke camp at daybreak this a.m. and marched to this place, at which I arrived at 9 a.m., meeting with no opposition and finding the bridge safe. We captured 10 guns, 7 kegs of powder, and 20 prisoners. There is another bridge four miles below. The road is good to both bridges on this side. On the opposite side the roads are swampy for about a quarter of a mile. I have picketed the road at both bridges and await orders. My vedettes have just brought in a company of State militia, seventeen strong.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
