General KELLEY:

After a hard day's work we have got here. Had to make poles and get wire east of here to make it reach. All quiet. General Averell's command has just arrived. Please let me know how long I am to remain here, so I can send up to Back Creek for our rations, as we run out to-morrow.

MARTINSBURG,

August 14, 1864.

General KELLEY:

I have no reliable news from below. Several of our scouts here say they cannot get through to Sheridan, Mosby having driven them back. They are working on the road; commenced yesterday; it is destroyed eight miles east of here. Mr. Willard can probably make an estimate at to when trains can pass over; think the line will probably be up by Tuesday evening.
