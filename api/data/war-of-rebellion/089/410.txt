CAPTAIN: I regret to inform you of the loss of three of Lieutenant Capron's cavalry by capture on our picket-line last night. One of the number made his escape and is now with his command at City Point. My field officer of the day will report more fully to-morrow. Major Tucker, commanding cavalry depot, has sent to me altogether 330 dismounted cavalry 58 mounted, who are now encamped temporarily in rear of our lines. What disposition does the general wish me to make of these men? Lieutenant Barre, who reports these men to me from Major Tucker, is of opinion that they are to remain here for any emergency that may arise. The work of revetment along our line is progressing rapidly, but I am entirely out of timber for this purpose. Can I have ten teams early in the morning?

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
