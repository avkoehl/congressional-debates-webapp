Provost-Marshal-General, Department of Arkansas:

MAJOR: Brigadier General Alex. Shaler, commanding at Devall's Bluff, reports that the rebel captain Raibon has agreed to surrender on Wednesday next, the 24th instant. The major-general commanding directs that you send an officer to Devall's Bluff at that time to parole this company and discharge them. The officer sent will report to General Shaler on arrival.

Very respectfully, &c.,

JOHN LEAVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

PINE BLUFF, ARK., May 20, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Mayberry with one lieutenant and ten men have surrendered from the opposite [side] of the river. Some twelve or fifteen of his men, he informs me, have surrendered with Captain Reynolds at Hick's Station, and Lieutenant Some with seven men are still out, but will come in as soon as Lieutenant Some, who is sick, becomes sufficiently able to do so. Captain Mayberry and six men want to take the oath of allegiance here; the balance wish to be paroled and go to their homes in Louisiana. Can I administer the oath to Captain Maybery and the six men without sending them to Little Rock?
