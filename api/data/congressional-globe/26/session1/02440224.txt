bridge was recently removed and carried off by the ice and
freshet
Objection was made to its introduction   whereupon
Mr GRAHAM moved a suspension of the rules
Mr TURNEY called for the yeas and nays on that motion,
which wers ordered, and were—yeas 67, nays 91
So the House refused to suspend the rules
Mr RUSSELL said the character of the House wns suffer
inein the opinion of the community, in consequence ol the tai
dlness with which the business ot the nation wasnanvarted   At
least one hundred claims have been matured by the committees,
and an opportunity has not been afforded them to report     Too
much time was taken up in debate, and it was highly proper
that the House should now proceed to business    Mr R th< n
moved a resolution, setting apart a portion ol the day for the
recep'ion of the reports of committees
Omection was, however, made to its reception
The SPEAKER suggested to the House that the business of
the nation could be got along with moie facility if Ihe rules
and order of business were strictly adhered to    A great deal
ot time was consumed in motions to suspend the rules, all to
no purpose
Mr RUSSELL said he was compelled, from the necessity of
the case, to more a suspension of the lu'es, butlhe motion was
not admissible
Mr TILLINGHA9T having claimed his right to the floor on
the appeal, he addressed the House at some length in opposi
tionto the decision of the Chair
Mr VANDERPOEL said if his colleague l_\lr Tillmore]
had been permitted Ui proceed, he wou'd have been delivered
of his speech long before this, and with much less injurv to the
public business He appealed to Ihe gentleman from Penn«yl
vania [Mr Petriki-j] to withdraw his objection and peimit his
colleague to proceed, and thereby save the time of the House
Mr PETRIKIN declining to withdraw his objection,
Mr VANDERPOEL moved the previous question on the ap
peal, which was seconded, and the main question ordered,
which mam question was, "Shall the decision of the Chaik
stand aa the judgment of the House "
The yeas tnd nays having been previously ordered on this
question, they were tatter, and were—yeas 96, nays 91
So the decision of the Chair was ,i(turned, and the gentle
man from New York was not permitted to proceed in his re
marks
Mr STUART moved that the House proced to the orders of
the day
Mr VANDERPOEL demanded the yets and nays on that
motion
Mr CaVE JOHNSON inquire 1 of the Chair what would
be the business bel ore the House, in else they i edited to go to
the orders of the day, and whether the subject ol the morning
hour would not go on
The CHAIR replied in the affirmative, and said that the ques
tion would be the motion of the gentleman lrom New York,
[Mr Hand,l that his col'eigue [Mr Fillmore] have leave to
proceed.
Mr GARLAND of Lou siana hoped the Speaker would not
give his opinion to gentlemen in advance, lor when the question
■ho ltd Come up he would appeal trem that decision
Mr STEWART then withdrew his motion to piocced to the
orders of the day.
Mr K GARLAND renewed it
The question was then taken by yeas and nays, and resulted
as follows—yeas 91, nays 110
So the House rel used to pioceed to the oiders of the day
The SPE\KER said the question now beiore the House was
the motion of the gentleman from New York, [Mr Hand } that
his colleague [Mr Fillwore] have leave to proced in his re-
marks on the subject beiore the House,
Mr R GARLAND DjI understand the cpsaker to decide
that the refusal of the Ho ise to proceed to the< rders of the day,
thereby continues the question before the House when the call
for the orders of the day was madel
The SPEAKER That is the decision of the Chair
<* Mr R. GiRLAND Then I appeal rom that decision on
the following grounds, viz that tlie House having, by a majo
nty only, refused to proceed to dispose ol the business on the
Speaker's table, and to the orders of the day, the rules setting
apart one hour for the consideration of reports lrom committees
and resolutions previous to proceeding to said business and or
ders, and giving said reports and resolutions prece lence during
that time, are not thereby suspended, that can only be done by a
vote of two 'birds, that number being necessary to Rive ihe re
solution, reported by the Committee of Elections, priority over
all other business, as it produces a change in ihe order of busi
ness asestiblished by the rules
Mr PETRIKIN moved the previous question on the appeal,
which was seconded, and the main question ordered
The mam question was, "Shall the decision of the Chair
stand as the judgment of the House1'
Mr R GART i\V demanded ihe yea? and nays on that
question, which were ordered, and were—yeas 152, nays 1 J.
So the decision of the Chair was sur-amed
Mr HAND then modified his motion, so as to leave it simply
that h s colleague he permuted to proceed—his former motion
having been, "to proceed in order '
\The question on granting leave was taken and agreed to
*|r CAVE JOHNSON moved the following a  a m idifica
Hon of his substitute for the ordinal proposition of the com
rartte*
Heatíved, Thit the Committee of Elections be anthonz-d to
report to this House such papers, and such ol their proieedinss
aa tbey may desire'o have printed by order of the Hon e, and
that they be instructed also to report lonhwith which five of the
ten mdividu lis claiming seats from the State of New fpney, re
ceived the greatest number of votes from the who eh ate lor
Representatives in the Congress of the United Slates at theeler
tion of 1839 in said State, with all the evidence of tint lait in
their possession Provided, That nothing herein contained «hall
be so construed as lo prevent or delay the action of said com
mittee m taking testimony, and dei iduig the said case upon llie-
mentaof the election
Mr FILLMORE ihen said he returned his thanks to the
House, buthewould not avail himeelfof thepeimiaston to
speak, inasmuch as he could never submit that important rieht
to the will of a majority He would seek some other opportu
nity to give his views, when he could exercise the right to do
so m virtue of the Constitution, and not by tire oermisuon of
a majority He would, however, so far avail hnnseil of the
opportunity affordel him to speak, as to amend the resolution
Pi Mr, JoiraaoN of Tennessee, by inserting the word 'legal"
before the word "votes, ' and to strike out the word "forth
with "
Mr   FISHER spoke at some length on the merits of the
question before the House, and, in ihe course of his remarks,
alluded to the course the committee had pursued, in delaying
the report    It had frequently undone at night all which it had
done during ihe day    He adverted, also, to the course of the
Opposition m staving off the question as to who were entitled to
seats and the great unwillingness they evinced to give light u]i
on ihe subjict which was new covered up m the committee
I  Mr F adverted to the fact that ihe gentlemen claiming seats in
I   virtue of the Governor's ceitificates had ne>er pretended that
I  they had a majority of the votes ol the people of New Jer
I   ^ev, but placed it on the ground thai they held the certificate
I   lleai ued at some length to show that the vote of the people was
I   bettei evidence to entitle to a seat on that floor than the certifi
cate of the Governor ol a Slate, which might be fraudulently
obtained.    He   viewed  the  subject in all its constitutional
bearings, m reply to the arguments heretofore advanced to sus
tain the rights of the certificate members   The certificate of the
Governor had been given in this case on a one sided view of the
poll, as was fully established by the testimony which had been
referred bv the House to the Committee of Elections    Mr  F
also wished to disabuse the public mind of another thing whilst
he was up    The certificate members, after the decision of the
House against the certificates, raised the question that they
were al«o entit'ed to seats, Decante those which the Governor
refused to accredit had received two hundred and  forty three
illegal v otes, a list of which th v handed in to the House and
had referred to the committee, accompanied by a mass of lesti
mony in the form of depositions taken by them to establish tho
fact
Now, said Mr F there was not a shadow of proof in the testi
mony to sustain the charge above, but, on the contrary, it was
proved thattheie were only twelve illegal votes, and that these
had been given te the gentlemen who claimed seats on the cer-
tificates Another allegatien had been made by the same gen-
tlemen, thatthejudges of election at Siddle river had robbed
the hil lot boxes of eight votes This too, has been proved to
be without a shadow of foundation This would lie an offence
lnvolvn g 1 high penally In lhat Sítate, and the party accused
havecha'lenged their accusers to prest nt them to the grand
jury to be tried for this penal offence But, said Mr F t be
lleve the accusers never will present the ludgts of election as
wis threaten  I, because the chirge was equally unfounded as
the other as tothe illegal votes
He presented many other strong points, which went to show
tint the H 'use bhon'daet on (his subject vw'hout deli) a full
report of which will be published hereifter
Mr SMITH of C mnecticut resretted that the gentleman who
had pieeeded him bid been interrupted, and that a wider
scope had not been allowed, to enable ihe members of the com
mittee to state all the facts He commented at large on the
manner in which the subject had been broug t before the
House It had been usual to isle ol the chairmen of commit
tees whether they were ready to report, or at what time it v. as
thought the committees could report but in this case, without
any consultation with the chairman of the Commutes of Elec
tions, the gen'lemin from Tennessep hart thought proper to in
troduce a proposition of an extraordinary character, to compel
tne committee to report without regard to the condition of the
busstness before if
Mr SMITH yielded to the suggts^ions of several members,
and moved an adiournment.
Mr TURN FY demanded the yeas and nays on that motion;
which were ordered, and were—yeas 91, nays 94, as f dlows

So the House refused toad|ourn.
' Mr SMITH resumed his lemarl , ind after (lnracterizmg
the pi.-reeding in relation to thi-siibiect as ola most novel cha-
racter, he thoueht it would have been more courteous to the
committee to have consulted it whether it wis prepaie-l (o
niake a report, beiore abruptly thrilling forvvaid a resolution
directing it to report foilhwitli lie denounced it as unprece
denied in legislation and involved .in attack on the committee
The resolution in effct s id thit the committee was incompe-
tent to form an opinitn on the testimony beiore it, and
there/ore, it must be reported to the House, to enable
it to do so It was an implied censure—it was as
much as to say that Ihe H uise had no confidence in
the committee He disapproved the decision ol the House
that the members of the committee should rot íeler to the con
di'ionof the tm me« b( foi" it to show not on y that it was im
possible to mike a íeport, Lut that it would d >great nqusticeto

Mr HQFrjIAN, who moved that the House adjourn
Mr CAVE JOHNSON demanded the yeas and nays on that
motion, which were ordered, and were—yeas 91, nays 80.

Mr WEBSTER ' as of opn on that Congress, under the
Csnstitution, already pojfes^ed lull and pleniiy powers over
the currency, and it ojkly/ieeded a dispo mon lo exercise them
Even if we voted in iivprof a proposition based upon this ie
solution, there was no|Srobabilily that a sufficient imiiiuri of
Stiles would accede to i , and by tuknig (Inm for ihis power,
we admit that we do not jo ^ess it at piesent, which would
place us m a worse position thin formeilv He, foi one, was
not disposid to assist in placing ( on',is  in sucha situation
Its only elleitwouH be to coun'enantc the idea that the cur-
rency must remain in its present deploiahle condition until we
can improve it by this roundabout process of anappl.raiion to
the States for an amendment of the Constitution Ifthis was
really so, our situation was moie de¡ loiable than he had yet

should detain the Senate with but a very brief exposition of his

be made

truth of the proposition, thai His desirable to infuse into the
