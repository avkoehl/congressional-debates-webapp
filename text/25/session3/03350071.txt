25th Cong....3d Sess.
The President's Annual Message—Mr. Cuskman,
Ho. of Reps.
Mr Ch-uiman/h  gentlemen from Virginia and
Mi-aissippi, [Mi Wist and Mr Prentiss,] as
well is others, have made the report, which we
hav e just been co isidering, the foundation of mucn
invective against the Executive of the United
S'ates, as welt ¿s the whole Democratic party
S l, it may be that the Chief Magistrate of the
United Sta es is otten maltreated oy this depart-
ment of the Government from the want of consid-
eration K would be well for us, piobably, to
be more oiien reminded, that our Government is
divided into three impoitant branches, the Legis
lative, the Executive, and the Judicial, and that
these several branches of the Government aie en-
titled to gieat respect and decorum, one from the
other We ought to remember that thePiesident
of the United States stands m as near a ¡elation
to the people as ourselvts, si've that he is elected
foi four yeais, and we foi two years only But
while each of us stand hce as the representative
of fifty thousand l ihabitants, the Chief Magistrate
is the representative of moie than fifteen millions
Al hough this House is the grand inquest of the
nation, and as such, is bound to inquiie into the
misconduct of public officers, yet 1 tmnk we ougnt
not to be reduced to such a date of degradation
as to mouse about the Executive Departments, to
see whether there be anything or not woithy of
reprehension In a community like ours, so intel-
ligent and watchful, and at the same time pos-
sessed ot so many sources of information, fraud,
in a public servant, cannot, for any great length oí
time, he concealed And although I will not yield
up my right as a Repiesentative, to ferretout baud
wheievti mil whenever i> may exisi, yet I will
nevei de^iade myself by bestowing unmented
abuse upo i a coo dmate branch of the Govern-
ment
Sir, the sime pimcipks and the same motives
winch elevated a Jeffe-son, a Madism, and a
Momoe to the Chief Magistracy, raised up the
present enlightened and distinguished Chief Mag
istiateof the Lfinted States, as well as his lllus
tnous piedecessoi And, sn, although honest
pi nciples are an indispensable requisite for men
who fill this exalted station, yet this is not enough
We must have men of talents, men of uncompro-
mising integrity, men of high intellectual and
moml cultuie Such must be the qualifications of
those who would wish to pieside over the desti-
nies of the Amencan people In my humble
judgment, such are the men who have, for the
iast ten yeais, and who do now, compose the
Amu loan Cibinet Men who have been so edu-
cated that tiey would not, foi a moment, tolerate
anything which was wrong, eithei m themselves
or in otheis ovei whom they possessed contiol
Men whose feelings, motives, and conduct, are in
pel feet accordance with the puie principles of the
whole Demociatic party, of which they aie mem
bers, that eveiything appeitammg to the affairsof
the people, should be done opemy, as in the clear
light of the meridian sun I will sustain no man,
or body of men, who wou'd conceal a single act
in the admin stration of ¡he Government, from
the sovereignty of the nation—'he people
That was the character of the past, and is the
ctaracer of the piesent Admims^iat on Then
desne is th it eveiy p lbhe act should be pro
chimed, as it were, upon the house top, so as to
keep themselves, continually uefore the tribunal of
an enlightened, virtuous, and magnanimous peo
pie When ¡ ut'er these sentiments, Í feel we 1
persuaded that I uttei the sentiments of the whole
Democratic party of the country And, air, could
the voice of the people of tins w,de spiead coun-
try be united as the voice of one man, and as it
will be united in the * ear eighteen hundred and
forty, in the reelection of the ruesent enlightened
and patuotie statesman who is now so ably,
wisely, and judiciously administering the Govei n
ment, that voice would utter, in the honest pude
of a grateful people, that the Executive of the
United States, for talents, for fidelity, and for high
moral mil intellectual cultuie, is not surpassed by
any cabi let council unon the face of the earln
Can a iy ore believe, for a moment, thai such
men can tnemselves f rartice tiaud, or tolera e
si ch a oase and infamous crime 11 t t*>ers > IN i,
sr m ch a *hn g ,s impossible Eveí y act of t1 e
Admimstiation has repelled, and is continuing to
repel, every supposition of that chaiacter.
Sir, notwithstanding the purity of intention in
which the Government is administered, we are,at
times, obliged to sit here, day after day, and hear
the character of those public servants, who have
been elevated to office, in part, through the instru-
mentality of my constituents, assailed in language
highly unbecoming, as I think, to any gentleman
who has been honored with a seat in an Ameri-
can Congress. A day or two since, thegentleman
from Mississippi [Mr Prentiss] observed, "that
the twolast Administrations were conceived in sm,
and biought forth in miqaity " That their whole
course " had been marked by corruption, extrav-
agance, and piofligacy " These are bold charges
upon the people who elect, as well as upon those
who are elected to office Sir, I repel those
chaiges i'hey are unfounded Extravagance or
profligacy is an unnecessary expenditure of money
Nei'her the Administration of General Jackson,
or Mr Van Buren, can with any propriety be
charged with such expenditures It is very true,
that the question has repeatedly been asked by
gentlemen upon this floor, why it was that the
expenditures of the Government should have in-
creased from $13,000 000, as they were under
Mr Adams's admimstiation, up to §35,000,000
or §40,000,000.
1 well remember that a question of this kind
was asked at the early part of the last session of
Congress, by a gentleman fiom Massachusetts,
[Mr CubHiNtr ] I remember, too, that that ques-
tion was published in all the Federal papers in
New Hampshire, previous to the last annual elec
tion, m glaring capitals, so that the wayfaung
man might read and understand Read and un-
derstand what, sn ' The truth' No, su , but
read and undeistand that which would best sub- i
serve the inteiests of the demagogue This is de- '
ception, for a more unfounded insinuation was
never made There was no year of Mr Adams's
administration in which the whole expendi-
tures did not exceed §22 000,000, instead of only
$13,000,000, as was asseited by implication, or
directly, by that gentleman And, sir, in order
to place this subject in its true light before the
people, that they may have the whole tiuth, and
nothing but the truth, I have prepared the fol-
lowing table, tuking the first four years of Mi I
Monroe's administration, the four years of Mr
Adams's administration, and the first foui years
of General Jackson's administration, by which it
appears that, in                                                             '

Since the period last mentioned, the ordinary
expenses of the Government have been increased,
and, together with the extraordinary expenditures,
have made the whole amount of the disburse-
ments of the Government, for a few years past,
what they were m 1817, nearly forty millions
But in all this there is no mystery, excepting to
him who has no desne to understand the truth
Let us take into consideration the permanent
increase which has been made to the army of the
United States—the extraoidinary increase of the
pension roll—the building of light houses, custom-
houses, and improvement of harbors—the rebuild-
ing of the 'ñeasmy Department and the Patent
Office—the payment of Indian annuities, and the
extinguishment of titles to Indian lands—the re-
mov al of the Indians ncsi of the Mississippi—to all
which aie to be added the large appropiiations
which have been made in coi sequence of the
Black H<uo7*uar, the Seminole, and other Indian
hostilities Here is the plain and mcontroveitible
answer to the question, not why the whole ex-
penditures oe the Government have increased from
thnteen millions to thirty five millions or forty
millions, but why they have been increased from
twen'y four millions, as they were under Mi
Adams's administration, to thnty nine millions,
as they v. ere under Mr Monroe's administration
The Federalists have seized upon the gieat
amount of the public expendituies as a fruitful
theme of detraction, and of wanton attack upon
the whole Democratic party We often hear it
said that we came into povvei in 1329, bearing
upon oui lips thepiomiseof retrenchment anil
reform, but that we have been entirely faithless
to that promise But bold assertions can deceive
no one, unless he is very much predisposed to
selr deception I could show, had I time so to
do, that the above mentioned piomise has been
kept, so lar as the Executive of the United (states
or l's friends had the power, to the very letter I
shall stop heie, however, to give only one lllus-
tra ion of this tiu h, that is, the lefoini which
ought never to be forgotten, a reform in the sys-
tem of menial impiovtmerts by the Geneial
Government, whe-ebv more than one hundíed and
swty millions of thepeople's money has been saved
by a timely and jndici jus interposition of the veto
power Other lefoims could be mentioned, but
that is enough to answei for all the ciamoi unou
that submit The causes of the extiaordiniry
exnenditures of the Government have ah been
spiead befoie the American people, anu they have
seen, with deep regret, the large but unavoidable
appropriations which have been made to meet the
expenses of the Indian wars But the°e expend-
ituies have baen, and will contn ue to be, met by
the Democnry of the country with as much cheer
fulness as weie the expenses of the viai by which
oui independence wis achieved, or those attend-
ant upon the wai of 1812, to preserve and pei-
petiate that independence
X he residue of these extraordinary expenditures
have been foi o'jects in which the people have felt
avtrj deeo inteiest Theiefore, ail the appiopna-
ti ni for tnose o jects have met with their toidial
approbat on We hiv , to be sure, mid out !¡>r£e
sums ot monev foi tne extinguishment of tit cs to
Inoinn lands, but thaf money is not lost Ihere
we hav sou rani ey % wor'h in lards And I feel
perfectly persuaded that all the expenses which
have heietofoie attended, oi which may hereafter
