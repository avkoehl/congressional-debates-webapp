MORGANZA, LA., November 24, 1864. (Received 10.20 a. m.)

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy's cavalry are hovering around all my lines. General Lawler drew in what few cavalry pickets there were and yesterday before sundown the enemy attempted to cut off my up-river outposts, killing the officer in command and several men. Last night they attacked my left, killing some and driving off the cattle. It is represented that a force, large or small, is crossing the Atchafalaya. It will not be possible to prevent the capturing of outposts without cavalry. Colonel Chrysler, Second New York [Veteran] Cavalry, is here to take away the thirty or more cavalry left and all the ineffective men. I earnestly ask that Colonel Chrysler, with his regiment, now at Baton Rouge, be ordered back, as they are all familiar with every bridle-path in this section. It is desirable that I should have an answer this morning before Colonel Chrysler leaves.
