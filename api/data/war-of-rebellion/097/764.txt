General Ord wishes me to inform you that Fort Darling and other works at Drewry's Bluff are not to be dismounted, at least for the present. He also mentioned the works on the north side of the river, but I suppose they are already dismounted.

Major-General HALLECK,Chief of Staff:

I understand that most of the forces in the Valley will surrender, and have made arrangements to meet them Wednesday next at New Market for this purpose. The commandeer surrender their detachments and battalions without regard to higher organizations. I do not know what effect the intelligence of the murder of the President will have on their determination.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 15, 1865. (Received 12. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I would respectfully inquire whether your dispatch* directing the arrest of all persons coming into the lines is intended to make any paroles. They have just commenced coming in, and I expect a regiment of Imboden's command in this morning. I am particular in asking, as the disposition made of those who come in first will effect the conduct of those now hesitating about giving themselves up.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
