brigade to General Whiting and the two siege guns (30-pounder Parrotts) to General French for the Blackwater. All is reported quiet in the direction of New Berne. Your letter of the 23rd is just received.

G. W. SMITH,

Major-General.

BURWELL'S BAY, December 29, 1862.

Brigadier General HENRY A. WISE:

GENERAL: Yesterday was the first time I could get a view of Newport News since my note of the 20th instant; it has been hazy all the time. Found only two vessels in sight to-day. A small sloop passed down from Mulberry Island; she had the United States flag flying.

On the night of Christmas eve a party of negroes came over from the other side and robbed a gentleman by the name of Branch of meat and other things to the value of over a thousand dollars. Branch lives 6 miles above my station. This is the second time they have come over since I came here. These negroes are said to be camped in nearly every vacant farm house from Jamestown Island to Newport News. If I had 30 men and a sufficient number of boats I believe I could capture a number of these negroes.

WILLIAM HARMAN.

CLAREMONT, December 30, [1862].

GENERAL: I received two dispatches to-day, one indirect; the other has been delayed several days.

Yours, respectfully,

WM. DICKINSON.
