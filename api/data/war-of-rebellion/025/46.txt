Memphis, Columbus, and Decatur have been opened. Rebel guerrillas cut the repaired road in two placed, through carelessness in guarding it, but damage very slight. Some skirmishing at outpost, but loss inconsiderable. Enemy has been making demonstrations against us for several days, but I think intends no serious attack. The advance of General Buell's army will reach Huntsville to-day. It is believed that the enemy is already evacuating East Tennessee.

(By telegraph from Corinth.)

Major General U. S. GRANT:

The part of Wallace's division at Bolivar was ordered to Grand Junction. There is no danger of an attack in force on Memphis. It is a mere stampede. The great object now is to protect the railroad against marauders. There was culpable neglect in sending out the train from Memphis till the road was properly guarded. You will report by whose neglect the accident and the capture of telegraph repaired occurred.

Why not send out strong reconnaissance and ascertain the facts? It looks very much like a mere stampede. Floating rumors must never be received as facts. Order an investigation of the loss of the train and capture of our men by a force of the enemy and report the facts. I mean to make somebody responsible for so gross a negligence.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Corinth, Miss.:

I did not say 30,000 troops at Shelbyville, but at Abbeville, which is south of Holly Springs, on the road to Grenada. I made a report of all I knew of the capture of the train, and sent by way of Columbus,
