FLAG-SHIP MONONGAHELA,

Off Port Hudson, May 30, 1863.

Major-General BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf:

DEAR GENERAL: I send you Lieutenant-Commander Terry, for the purpose of arranging the affair of the navy battery of 9-inch guns. Captain Alden very promptly said he would furnish the officers and men to work the guns. Lay the platforms with a slight inclination, so as to make it easy to run the battery and check the recoil. Separate the guns, so as not to expose too much to chance shot. Lieutenant-Commander Terry is an intelligent officer, and will do justice to the country and all concerned.

Respectfully and truly,

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE GULF, NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS,Before Port Hudson, May 30, 1863.

Major General D. HUNTER,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: I have just received your letter of the 2nd instant, asking that the troops at Key West may be ordered to join you. In reply, I have the honor to state that these troops nominally a part of the Tenth Army Corps, actually formed the garrisons of Key West and the Tortugas. Those posts having been transferred to the Department of the Gulf, it is impossible, especially in view of the present exigencies of the service in this department, to relieve the garrisons.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.
