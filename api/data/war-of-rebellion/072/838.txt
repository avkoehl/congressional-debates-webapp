Commanding officers of the battery have, without an exception, and the hearty co-operation of the subordinate officers, who merit equal honor with themselves for the fortitude and endurance of the commanding during the longest and most arduous campaign of the war.

JOSEPH McKNIGHT,

Senior First Lieutenant, Commanding Fifth Wisconsin Battery.

Major CHARLES HOUGHTALING,

Chief of Artillery, Fourteenth Army Corps.
