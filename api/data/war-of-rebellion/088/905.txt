Colonel HENRY L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy have fired all day, wounding two men in the canal. Am of the opinion that the quickest and best way to stop their firing altogether is to send fifty men across and capture their pieces. Think it could be done.
