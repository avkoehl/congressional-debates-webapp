FORT MONROE ARSENAL, VA., July 25, 1865.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN, U. S. Army,

Commanding Mil. Div. of the Mississippi, Saint Louis, Mo.:

SIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of ordnance and ordnance stores surrendered by the Confederate Army commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, C. S. Army, at Greensborough, N. C., May, 1865, to Major General W. T. Sherman, commanding the U. S. forces. Lieutenant Myers, chief of ordnance, Department of North Carolina, who was charged with the reception of these stores, reports as follows:

The number of small arms turned in is exceedingly small. This is accounted for by the utterly disorganized condition in which the troops were found. The arms are scattered throughout the country between Danville, Greensborough, Salisbury, and Charlotte, and some of them are to be found in almost every house. Orders have been given to have them collected as rapidly as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. G. BAYLOR,

Captain of Ordnance and Bvt. Colonel, U. S. Army, Commanding.
