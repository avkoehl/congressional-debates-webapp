THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 23,
should I be much short of an idiot, much short
of a fool, if I were not to invite them away? The
loyal States of this nation are now engaged in a
contest for its very,existence. On the one side
we have arrayed the loyal old men, and middle-
aged-men, and young men of the country. On
the other side we have the rebel owners of slaves
arraying their young men and their slaves on the
other. There are some hundreds of thousands of
colored people native born on the soil on which
they live who will leave their rebel masters the
very moment they have an intimation that they
will receive the protection of the Constitution and
laws of the United States; and yet we insanely
continue this controversy, not permitting these
strong-armed men to aid us and save the lives of
our brothers and our sons.
But the Senator from Kentucky said that he
thought on this subject with horror when he re-
flected that massacies had occurrcd of white peo-
ple in some of the West Indialslands. Mr. Presi-
dent, oppressed people in every age, in asserting
their right to themselves, have committed acts of
'atrocity that civilized communities could never
justify. It is no more common to the African race
than to the Anglo-Saxon, or the Caucasian, of
whatever country. I will ask him, with his per-
fect knowledge of history, to compare the scenes
of carnage and blood enactcd there with those en-
acted butafewyeaissincein the streets of Parisâ€”
the capital of one of the most enlightened and re-
fined nations that have existed, and which at this
time stands at the very head of the civilized nations
of the world.
The proposition which was made, to which I
was speaking, was a proposition to allow the com-
mander of this division of the Army to muster into
the service of the United States such Joyai per-
sons as might present themselves irrespective of
color. What does that imply ? That they shall
be organized, that they shall be officered, that they
shall be commanded, that they shall be controlled
by the laws of the United States and by I lie arti-
cles of war. 1 took some pnina to state on that
occasion that I would not advocate a proposition
to arm indiscriminately the mass of the servile pop-
ulation even in the rebel Stales; but that, if arms
were placed in their hands, they should be organ-
ized, disciplined, and placed under the ordinary
restraints of military rule.
1 have no ciiticism to make in relation to the
Senator's eulogium of the peaceable condition of
his own slaves, other than this: if they arc of the
character which he has described, and have been
ever ready to stand by him and their masters in
time of pestilence and danger; if that statement of
the character of his own slave household be cor-
rect, I dniw the conclusion that the alarm of the
Senator is totally without foundation. If they are
thus Christianized, aie thus enlightened, and will
stand by their masters through every kind of ca-
lamity that ran arise, what will be the danger of
placing them in an attitude not only to defend
themselves, but their masters and their country?
But, sir, all this eulogium of the character of the
houses and clothing of the slaves, if it weie a le-
gitimate'subject of discussion at this time, li take
it, might be said with equal truth of the Senator's
horses and cattle, and oxen and mules. 1 would
ask him if he treats his slaves as men? I would
ask him if ho treats the mas men possessing spirits
immortal that are to live parallel with hisown spn-
ltual existence, and if he gives them the means of
mental cultivation and of moral development; or
if it be not in his own State, with his sanction, a
penitentiary offense to teach these slaves to read
the Word of God. They are well housed, so are
his hoiHcs; they are well eloihcd,so would be his
cattle if necessary to their health and vigor; they
are tenderly treated, so is every other species of
jive property thatisunder his control. The ques-
tion, however, with me is not how this Christian
gentleman or the other may happen to treat those
over whom he may exercise absolute control, but
what is the system'* How may he with impunity
treat those human cattle, if he chose to treat them
with severity?
1 will venture here to throw in the remark, and
risk its b-ung successfully contradicted, that there
is not now in existence, and has not been in ex-
istence since the dawning of civilization, a system
of slavery so bad as the one now in existence in
the United States. There never has existed, and
docs not now exist, a system of human bondage
oh this whole earth so loathsome as the one that
now exists in the bosom of this Christian nation,
and I defy successful contradiction. I do not say
that Christian gentlemen may not, regardless of
the law and regardless of the system, treat their
slaves humanely. They do. I know they do.
I am proud to say that I know they do; but it is
a tribute to humanity and to the influence of Chris-
tianity on the minds of men, and not a tribute to
the system of slavery itself.
I unite very cordially with the Senator in his
expression of the hope that these collateral, out-
side questions may not be discussed, and that we
may unite harmoniously for the purpose of put-
ting down this rebellion; and I trust that he may
be willing, out of the abundance of his patriotism,
even to give his slaves to the cause of the Union
if it becomes necessary, and not be giving the
weight of his influence and of his talent, (which
is by no means small,) unintentionally on his part,
to the cause of the rebellion. If any speech de-
livered during this session of the Congress of the
United States shall see the light in the rebel States,
it will be the speech which the Senator from Ken-
tucky has just concluded; and thus has he, very
unintentionally on his part, neutralized much that
he has said of the policy and bearing of the Sen-
ator from Indiana during the earlier jjart of this
rebellion, which he has so severely criticized.
1 had intended, Mr. President, after making
these explanations, to say a few words in relation
to the legitimate subject of discussion before the
Senate; but, on account of the lateness of the
hour, I will not claim the further indulgence of
the Senate.
Mr. CLARK obtained the floor.
Mr. WILSON". Will the Senator give way
for an executive session ?
Mr. CLARK. Certainly.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
On motion of Mr. WILSON, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of executive business;
and, after some time spent therein, the doors were
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.

Mr. ELIOT. I am directed by the Committee
on Commerce to report to the House a bill pro-

ors, and to ask that it be put upon its passage.
The bill was read a first and second time by its

serve as light-house inspector of any light-house
district on the coast of the United States; and pro-
vides that the person so appointed shall rcceive"

main question ordered; and under the operation
thereof the bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and, being engrossed, it was
