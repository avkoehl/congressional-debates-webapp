stances may make proper for you to attack him. Of this you must judge. Use all possible endeavors to get information. Our latest intelligence, partly through Pleasonton's fight and partly through other sources, developed the intention of the enemy to commence a raid with his cavalry on the morning of the 10th. Whether his infantry were to accompany him or not, we have not ascertained. General Lee's headquarters are said to be in the vicinity of Culpeper. Longstreet's and Ewell's corps (infantry) and Stuart's corps (cavalry) are reported in that vicinity. Please call for information, as reported from all sources, that you may be informed of and transmit the same to the general. The general expects to be able to leave here to-morrow. He desires that you will cause particular attention to be paid to Beverly and Rappahannock Fords. A communication in the shape of a circular in inclosed, which you will issue or not, at your discretion.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Camp near Falmouth, Va.,June 12, 1863.

Commanding Officer Third Corps:

I am directed by the major- general commanding to request you to take possession of the fords assigned you to hold to-night, and that you at once make use of all artificial means within your reach to enable you to make a determined resistance to any attempt made by the enemy to cross at them. Your especial attention and care is called to those fords which admit of the passage of artillery and cavalry with infantry. Fell trees, make abattis, dig rifle-pits, or anything else that will add to the strength of your position. Be careful to have your reserves posted within easy supporting distance, keeping them out of sight of the enemy, and hold all your troops well in hand. It will be advisable for yourself and staff to precede the head of the corps as far as prudent, that you may the more readily have your corps in position.

Very respectfully,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
