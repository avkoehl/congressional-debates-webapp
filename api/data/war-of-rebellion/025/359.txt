Assistant Adjutant-General.

LA GRANGE, TENN., November 24, 1862.

Brigadier General C. S. HAMILTON,

Commanding Left Wing:

Your instructions for the move on Friday will be sent over in a short time. Lee need not go, as he could not ascertain if the enemy are evacuating Tallahatchie in time for an earlier move than we expect to make in any event.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

BOLIVAR, TENN., November 25, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

Colonel Haynie sends two couriers from Bethel. Henderson Station was taken by a large body of rebel cavalry this morning. His communication with Jackson cut off. He wants a regiment sent down from Jackson; says that General Dodge will send up a regiment from Corinth. He has sent a company to McNairy Station, and will send the Forty-eighth when General Dodge's regiment arrives. I think the rebels will try to strike this road near Medon to-night. I will strengthen our guards on railroad and be ready here.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
