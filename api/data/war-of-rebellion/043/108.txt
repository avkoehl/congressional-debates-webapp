Major-General MEADE,

Warrenton, Va.:

The troops to be sent east should number from 1, 500 to 2, 000. This detachment is all that it is proposed at present to take from your army; but under no circumstances can we now give you any re-enforcements. Every place has been stripped to the bare poles. Keep up a threatening attitude, but do not advance.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

In compliance with your instructions of yesterday, the following regiments have been ordered to New York Harbor, to report to Brigadier-General Canby: First and Thirty-seventh Massachusetts, Fifth Wisconsin, and Twentieth Indiana; aggregate present for duty, 1, 643. The regiments left here early this morning for Warrenton Junction, there to take railroad transportation to Washington. Owing to the large number of trains now run over the road, I presume the regiments will not reach Washington before tonight. Colonel Oliver Edwards, Thirty-seventh Massachusetts Regiment, commands the troops, and he has been instructed to acquaint the Quartermaster-General, by telegraph, with the strength of his command.
