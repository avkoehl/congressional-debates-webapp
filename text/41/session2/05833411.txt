And, if we accept the assertion of an emi-
nent European engineer, that any stream having
a volume of water nineteen feet wide and eight-
een inches deep may be made navigable, and
is considered a commercial stream in Europe,
theu there are still as many miles in addition
of navigable water in the great basin ; making
a total navigation of fifty thousand miles for
purposes of commerce.
These rivers convey the commerce of six-
teen sovereign States, and are most important
M crossing different latitudes, thus conveying
and effecting an interchange of the products
of different climates. I will not pause here to
institute a comparison of the population and
taxable wealth of these sixteen States with the
Population and wealth of the Atlantic, States
since population in this connection is second-
ary to the extent and variety of the commerce
created and maintained by the industry of that
population.
The country drained by these navigable riv-
ers contains 1,775,000 square mites, or over
700,000,000 square acres of fertile land, and
the returns of the census of I860 show that of
the 808,000,000 bushels of corn raised in the
United States, 634,000,000 were grown in four-
teen States of the Mississippi valley ; that of
the 173,000,000 bushels of wheat, 126,000,000
bushels, and of t he 172,000,000 bushels of oats,
103,000.000bushels; of the434,000,000pounds
of tobacco, 345,000,000 pounds, and of the
2,154,000,000 pounds of cotton, 1,097,000,000
pounds were produced in the same States; an ]
official report in estimating the value of the j
entire agricultural products of the nation in i
1S60 at $1,900,000,000, or five times the total
value of our exports for the same year, show- j
ing that four fifths were interchanged between
the States, indicating the value of the com- i
merce of these great producing States. j
But this is far below the actual value of this
commerce at the present time. Statistics show-
ing that the interchange of the wheat, corn,
oats, pork, &c., of the north western States for
the manufactures of Pennsylvania, the petro-
leum and salt of West Virginia, the manufac-
tures and products of Ohio, the tobacco of
Kentucky and Tennessee, the lead and iron
ores of Missouri, the cotton of Arkansas and
Mississippi, and the sugar and rice of Louisi-
ana gave to the cities of Louisville, Ciucinnati,
and St. Louis, and two or three minor points
on the Mississippi river, not including New
Orleans, Memphis, and Dubuque, in 1865, an
import commerce of over seven hundred mil-
lions ; and as the exports from these cities were
fully equal to the imports, these added to the
imports, and the estimated value of the com-
merce of the ports not included, evince that
the aggregate trade of the Mississippi valley
at that time exceeded $2,000,000,000, a sum
treble the value of the entire foreign commerce
of the whole United States in 1860. It may not
be out of place to state that the total arrivals
of steamers at the port of St. Louis alone for
the year ending December 31,1869, were 2,?89,
and the departures 2,786.
Nor, sir, has this internal commerce yet
reached its maturity. The Mississippi valley,
as yet but sparsely populated, presents so in
viting a prospect to immigrants that each year
its producing lands are so increased and mul-
tiplied that the Agricultural Bureau, an author-
ity least given to exaggeration, estimates the
breadstuff product alone of the northern por-
tion of the basin will in 1900 reach the enorm-
ous aggregate of over 3,000,000,000 bushels.
To transport this commerce the fourteen pro-
ducing States of the Mississippi valley owned
in 1860, as returned in the census of that year,
steam vessels having an aggregate carrying
capacity of 996,266 tons. Tne closing of the
Mississippi river by the war and the attendant
destruction of that period necessarily reduced
this aggregate, and the high price of reproduc-
tion has delayed its replacement, so necessary
to a full development of our internal resources.
The extent of the ship-building interests and
the loss to the agricultural interests by the high
import duties upon articles entering into con-
sumption by such building may, however, be
fairly computed from the returns of the cus-
toms officers for the year 1868. In that year I
find enrolled as comprising the tonnage of
twelve States, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennes-
see, Kentucky, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Illi-
nois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, and Penn-
sylvania, (and in this only river tonnage,) an
aggregate of 2,195 steam vessels, with a carry-
ing capacity of 481,217 tons. The cost of con-
struction of these vessels in 1860 was $70 per
ton, and is now $100.
This, sir, is a suggestive statement, as affect-
ing not alone the agriculturist of the West, but
the mechanic and the manufacturer in every
section of the country. The cost of produce,
especially of breadstuffs, is influenced to a
very great extent by the cost of carriage to
market, and high price in the cost of vessels
used upon our interior waters necessarily lends
to expensive freight tariffs which absorb a
large portion of the profits of th^ farmer, and
at the same time, by increasing the cost ofl'ivm;:,
necessarily enhance the cost of labor, render-
ing nugatory the energy and skill of the em-
ploying manufacturers. In making this state-
ment comparative of ship-building, which is
thus affecting our national prosperity, I have
avoided taking the high price per ton in 1864—
$1 40 j)er ton—so as to avoid even the appear-
ance of exaggeration, as that cost represented
rather an embarrassed and hampered industry
than an increase occasioned by enhanced cost
of materials from duties, &c.
But, sir, the mere statement of enhanced
cost of construction now over that of 1800
does not fully exhibit the increased import
upon the products carried by these western
steamers. It must be remembered that the
peculiar perils of river navigation and the use
of increased power to overcome strong currents,
render the duration of vessels employed in such
trade much less than of vessels plying on the
deep waters of the ocean, and therefore to the
original cost must be added that of frequent
replacement. Experienced masters and build-
ers of vessels on our western waters estimate
the average duration of the present wooden
boats at only six years. If iron could be used
in hulls, and it would be so used were it not
for the excessive import duties upon iron plates
and other material entering into the construc-
tion of steam vessels, being not less than from
twenty-five to thirty per cent, added to the
cost of such vessels, this period of duration
would be increased nearly fourfold, besides the
greater saving effected through greater carrying
capacity upon equal depth of water, by reason
of less displacement, a most important item
upon water of changeable volume.
I will refer to the fact that at this time there
is being constructed on the Ohio river an iron
steamboat—and if it was not for the great
additional cost of this class of vessels, from the
causes which have been referred to, they would
take the place of the wooden ones on the west-
ern waters, as it is being done on the ocean—
and would call the attention of the House to
some of the advantages claimed by the enter-
prising builders that she will have over those
possessed by wooden boats of her size. In the
first place the vessel is divided into many com-
partments, and should a hole be knocked in
her only one of the compartments would fill
with water; or should a fire occur no damage
could be done to the freight in the compart-
ment in which the fire originated, as she is
so constructed that she can be flooded with
water in a very few seconds. Is it not the
duty of Congress to encourage and foster the
construction of this class of vessels by the re-
moval of all obstructions within their jurisdic-
tion, and encourage an enterprise wherein the
lives and property of a large majority of the
people are more or less interested ? But, sir,
I am now considering only the present western
marine interests. The most competent author-
ities estimate the period of duration of our
present western steamers, as I have stated, at
only six years.
Thus is established the fact that at the pres-
ent high price of construction and over and
beyond a fair compensation for running ex-
penses, &c., the people of the Mississippi val-
ley pay out of the returns of their produce,
and as a tax the most nearly direct of any tax
upon the farmers of the West, over eight mil-
lion dollars per annum. Of this sum at least
two millions may be assumed as added cost by
reason of custom duties upon materials enter-
ing into construction, and the residue being
the actual cost of the replacement of the ves-
sels that float from one State to another, and
from all to the ocean. Any measure which
would reduce the cost of carriage would not
