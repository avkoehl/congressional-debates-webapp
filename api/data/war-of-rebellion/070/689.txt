CITY POINT, VA., June 29, 1864-9 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Please send General Hunter here immediately on his arrival in Washington. Probably on consultation I can better direct future movements for him after such consultation.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

June 29, 1864-1.50 p.m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Hdqrs. Dept. of West Virginia, Loup Creek:

At the present juncture, and without knowing the state of your command, I do not think it right to order you to Washington, although desiring much to see you and express in person the great satisfaction your operations have given, and also to learn more details than can be communicated in writing; but if you can without any risk to the service be absent for twelve hours your visit here would be very acceptable. A longer absence, if desired by you, would not be objected to by the Department. You can best judge as to whether you can leave your command, and for how long a period.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Loup Creek, June 29, 1864. (Received 12 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Have received your dispatch of this date granting me permission to visit Washington for twelve hours. I did not wish to go to Washington unless you wished to see me. I shall, therefore, await your further orders in this department.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, June 29, 1864.

Major-General HUNTER,

West Virginia:

General Grant telegraphs that, as soon as your command is rested and supplied, he wishes you to effectually destroy the railroad at Charlottesville, and if possible, also the canal. It would be well, while reorganizing your forces for you to communicate with him directly by telegram in regard to the enemy, and the routes best to be followed.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
