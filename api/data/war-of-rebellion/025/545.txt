Brigadier General J. B. McPHERSON, Holly Springs, Miss.:

As soon as all public store, sic, &amp;c., are removed from Holly Springs fall back with the troops now occupying the place to the vicinity of La Grange, Grand Junction, or Davis' Mill.

When you arrive there, examine the railroad to the east and ascertain the practicability of supplying troops to Pocahontas by rail and teams. If practicable and you think it advisable, Denver's division may be moved to that place.

The Twenty-fifth Iowa and Ninetieth Illinois, now doing railroad duty, will be added to General Denver's division, giving him twelve regiments. By taking two regiments from the old brigade a new one can be formed.
