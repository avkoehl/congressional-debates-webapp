Brigadier General H. H. LOCKWOOD,

Commanding, Eastern Shore:

GENERAL: I shall send the revenue steamer Hercules to Pocomoke Sound to drive oiff depredators on the oyster beds. I have directed the lieutenant commanding to communicate with you if possible. The vessel has been placed at my disposal by the Secretary of the Treasury. Captain Duvall's company of cavalry, of the Purnell Legion, will, I hope, go to you next week. Please prepare shelter for the men and horses. I have been unable to procure arms for them, but expect to have revolvers for them by the end of this week. I think you have done right in taking inventories of the personal effects of persons in the service or under the protection of the Confederate Government, in order to prevent the transfer of such property to State in insurrection
