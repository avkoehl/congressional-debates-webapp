JEFFERSON CITY, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General VAUGHAN, Lexington:

Do not hesitate to use every man and all facilities to make Lexington safe. No enemy west of the Gasconade, and none heard of west of Washington. I will fully protect the capital. The citizens are turning out nobly; large bodies of militia are collecting. You must take horses from the people to mount your command. The Pacific Railroad has not been disturbed in my district, and the heavy rains will raise the rivers and be a great protection.

Yours, &amp;c.,
