Mr Taney is selected' He is the one pitched
upon, as if nobody but him had arraigned the
illegal acts of this committee, and then he is made
toairaign the existence of the committee, and
not its misconduct' Is this light' Is it fan ' Is it
just thus to puisue that gen Lit man, and to pursue
him unjustly > Can the vengeance of the bank
never be appeased while he lives and moves on
earth >
Mr B had perfoimed a duty, which ought not
to be delayed an hour, in defending himself, the
Piesident, and Mi Taney, from the sad injustice
of that íepoit The lepoit itself, with all its elab-
orate pleadings foi the bank—its enors of omis-
sion and commission—would come up for aigu-
ment after it was punted, and then, with God's
blessing, and the help of better hands, he would
hope to show that it was the duty of the Senate
to lecommit it, with m&tiuctions to examine wit-
nesses upon oath, and to bung out that secret
history of the institution which seems to have
been a sealed book to the committee. For the
piesent, he would bring to light two facts, de-
tected in the mtneate mazes of the monthly state-
ments, which would fix: at once both the chaiactei
ot the bank and the charactei of the leport, the
bank, foi its audacity, wickedness, and false-
hood, the lepoit, for its blindness, fatuity, and
paitiality
The bank, as all America knows, (said Mi
B ,) filled the whole country with the endless cry
winch had been echoed and íeechoed fiom this
Chamber, that the removal of the dtposits had
1 ud hei undei the necessity of curtailing her
debts, had compelled hu to call in her loans, to
fill the vacuum in hei cofteis produced by this
íemoval, and thus to enable heiself to stand the
ptessuic \\ hioh the "hostility" of the Government I
was bringing upon hei This was the asseition
for six long months, and now let facts confiont
this assertion, and leveal the tiuth to an out-
lawed and insulted community
The first ftct (said Mi B ) is the transfer of
the moneys to London, to he there idle, while
squeezed out of the people here duimgthe panic
and piessu-e
The cry of distiess was raised m December,at
the meeting of Congress, anddunng that month
the sum of $129,704 was transfened, by the
ban! , to its agents the Baungs This ciy waxed
str )ngi_i till July, and until that time the monthly
transicis were

Miking the sum of neatly tlvee millions and a
half transfened to London, to he idle in the hands
of an agent, while tint \eiy money was squeezed
out of a few cita s here, and the whole countiy,
and the Hall  oí Congress, weie filled with the
deafening din of the ciythat the bank was foiccd
to cuitad, to supply the loss in hti own colleis
from the removal ot the deposits' And worse
ytt' The bank had. m the hinds of the same
a°ents, i higc sum whin the tianfeis of these
panic collections began making m the whole the
sum ot >4,%1,201, on the 1st day of July hst,
which was lj uig idl< m hei agents' hands in Lon-
don, diawmg little oi no interest theie, while
squtized out of the hands of those who were
paying bank i itcrtst heie, near seven pel cent ,
and had afteiwaids to go into brokeis' hands to
boi iow atom oi two per cent a month Even
now, at the list letuins on the fiist da\ of this
month, about two nu'hons and a half of this mo
ney (§2,687,000) weie still lying idle in the hands
of the Banngs, waiting till foreign exchange can
be put ip again to eight oi ten pti cent ' The
enoimity of this conduct (Mi. B said) was ag-
gia\ated by the notorious fact, that the tiansfeis
4
of this money were made by sinking the pnce of
exchange as low as five per cent below par when
shippeis aad planters had bills to sell, and íaisuig
it eight per cent above pai when merchants and
importers had to buy, thus double taxing the
commeice of the countiy, double taxing the pio-
ducei and consumer, and making a fluctuation of
thirteen per cent in foreign exchange in thebnef
space of six months. And all this to make money
scarce at home, while charging that scarcity upon
the President'—thus combining calumny and
stock jobbing with the diabolical attempt to rum
the country oi to rule it
The next fact (Mi B said) was the abduction
of an immense amount of specie fiom New Oi-
leans, at the moment the western pioduce was
arriving theie, and thus disabling the merchants
fiom buying that pioduce, and thereby sinking
Us mice nearly one half, and all undei the false
pretext ot supplying the loss in its coffers, occa-
sioned by the íemoval of the deposits
The falsehood and wickedness of this conduct
will appeal from the fact, that at the time of the
íemoval of the deposits, m Octobei.the public
deposits in the New Oi leans branch, were far
less than the amount afteiwaids cuitailed and
sent off, and that these deposits were not entnely
diawn out foi many months aftei the cuitailment
and abduction of the money Thus, the public
deposits in October weie
In  the  name  of the  Treasurer  of the United
States.................$294,228 62
In the name of public officers......173,7b4 64
$467,993 26
In all, less than half a million of dollars
In Maich, there was still on hand
In the name of the Tieasuier......$40,266 28
In the name of publjc officers.......    63,671 80
f 103,938 08
In all, upwaids of one hundred thousand do!
lais, and making the actual withdiawal of depos-
its, at that branch, but 4360,000, and that paid
out giadually, in the dischaige of Government
demands
Now, what was the actual cuitailment dining
the same peliod? It is shown fiom the monthly
statements, that these cuitailments, on local loans,
were $788 904—being upwirds of double the
amount of deposits miscalled lemoueii, loi they
weie not temoied, but only paid out in the reg
ular piogiess oi Government disbure ment, and
actually i dimming m the mass of cnculation,
and much of it m the bank itself But the specie
lemoved duiing the sime time' that was the
fiet, the damning fict, upon which he ltlitd
This abduction was
In the month of November, $334,647, at the least
In the month of Maich,        808,084, at the least
$1,142,731
Making near a million and aquaiter of dolíais,
at the least Mr B íepeated, at the least, for a
monthly statement does not show the accumul i
Uon of the month, which might also be sent off
and the statement could only be relied on foi so
mm h as appealed a month befoie the abduction
was made. Piobably the sum was upwaids of a
million and a quar'ei of haid dolíais, thus taken
away fiom New Orle-ins last winter, by stopping
accommodations, c illmg m loans, bicaking up
domestic exchange, creat ng panic and piessurc,
and sinking the pi ice ot all pioduce, that the
inothei bink might tiansfer fundb to LonJon,
gamble in  foieign exchinge, spread desolation
1 and tenor through the land, and then chaige the
I whole upon the President of tne United Slates,
and end with the giand consummation of bung-
I mg a new political party into power, and peipet-
uating its own charter
These (said Mr B ) are two, and only two,
I out of multitudes of the astounding iniquities
which have escaped the eyes of the committee,
while they have been so successful in their anti-
quanan íeseaidics into Andrew Jackson's and
Fthx Grundy's letters ten oi twenty yeais ago,
and into Maitm Van Bmen's and Thomas H.
Benton's six oi eight yeais ago—lettcis which
eveiy public man is called upon to give to hia
neighbois or constituents, which no public man
ought to refuse, or, in all probability, evei did
refuse, and which aie so ostentatiously paraded
in the repoit, and so emphatically lead in this
chamber with pause and gesture, and with such
a sympathetic look foi the expected smile fiom
the fnends of the bank, letters which, so fai as
he was concerned, had been used to make the
committee the oigan of a falsehood And now,
Mi B would be glad to know who put the com-
mittee upon the scent of those old musty letters;
for there was nothing in the resolution under
which they acted to conduct their footsteps to the
silent coveit of that small game
But Mr B was done foi the piesent. He was
done ("or the pn sent,butnotforthefuture Justice
cannot be done upon thisiepoitof the committee
until it is punted The only object which he now
had m view was to vindicate some gentlemen, in-
cluding himself, who were most unjustly treated,
and to show the tiue chaiaoter of the tntne lepoit,
by exhibiting the minute diligence and mnaeuloua
success of tht committee in hunting out things of
nothing, to be turned to the account of the bank,
and to the pr judice of its ad\cisanes, while stone
blind to such íecent and such enoimous miscon-
duct of the bank as he had just detailed to the
Senate, and which came within the precise letter
of the Ksolutions under which they aottd
Mr TYLER said he was peifectly willing that
the ícport should go back to the committee, and
that the honoiablc gentleman [Mi Blnton]
should be plxeid upon the committee Theie was
not a single asseition in the repoit which did not
stand upon  proof, upon documentary pi oof,
which could not he, and he mvitid the honoi-
able gentleman's attention to it Time was sur-
ficient in the íepoit to satisfy the people upon the
subject of the cuitailment bv the bank—whether
it was neccssaiy oi not Htie were then oideis,
and they weie submitted to 'he Senate to say
whethei there was necessity foi it o. otherwise
If the gentleman fiom Missounhad look  d to both
the statements in the lepoit, he surelv would not
have piouounced it an ex paite íepoit Mi T.
said his delibeiate opinion was, and he should de-
cíale it befoie the con utij, that the bank was light
in its contiovcisv with the Government, and that
its advusaiy was wrong In ugaid to the ex-
change committee, no ftlse issue 1 ad bten made
The lepoit txmessly leii ncd to the argument of
Mi TancVjwho contended that the exchange
committee \v\s m itself i positive violation of the
chai ei of tin bank With i gaidt the lettei of
G( neial Cadwaludi l, he km w nothing of it, noi
did he think it of any const qui nee Tne biancb,
howi vei, w as established at St Louis—whether
it came theie by means of the honoiablc gentle^
man s influence or his blows He knew that the
bank had undeigone fuquent reviews by that
gentleman, and that tin y had bten sent into all
pirts of the countiy,pnd no doubt thi j had then
due influence But hi declined adding anything
moie, and eoiielued by moving that the íepoitand
documents be prmti d, which wasagieed to, and
then
Tire Senate adjourned o\er to Monday next
