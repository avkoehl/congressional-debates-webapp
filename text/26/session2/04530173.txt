APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLGfcE.

26th Cong-•••2nd Sess.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Thompson.
JH. of Reps.
now found upon every sea, and (he stars and
the stripes have sufficient power to protect our
commerce, wherever it may be found It cer ainly
i  not the policy of this Govdrnment to keep up a
large and sp'endid navy id a lime of peace
But, said Mr W my colleague [Mr Mason}
has told the committee tint our navy was in a "rn
inous and dilapidated condition,' that the present
and preceding Administrations hid most shameful-
ly neglected it S r, said Mr W my colleague is
mistaken, he ouzht 10 have examined into the facts
before he made thi^ sweeping declatalioa. I bave
evidence before me which I trust will satisfy even
n.y colleague that his assertions are unfounded m
truth. In 1823, vhen General Jackson came in o
power, our naval force in cum.nis5ion consisted
of—
One ship of the lme     -           -           - 74 guns
Three fnga'es, firs* class           -           -44 guns
Nine sloops, second class           -           - 18 guns.
The whole number of men in active service at
this period was 3 875 Now, let us see how it
stands in 1841, am' then we can readily determine
with how much truth the charse has been made
against the present and precedías; Administrations,
of neglecting this impor ant branch of the public
service, and suffering it to fall into "mm and di-
lapidation " The wnole navl force in commis-
sion at this time is as follow 
One ship of the line,                           74 guns
Three fnga e , first cla«s,                   44    "
Two frigates, second class,                36   "
Eight sloops, first class,                      20   "
Five sloops of Ihe third class,             16   "
Three brigs,                                        10   "
Six schooners.
The whole number of men in actaal service in
1841, is *et down at 6 000, or nearly double the
number employed in 1829 In addition to this,
the marine corps was, in 1834, ncreased from 1 ">0
to 1,000 Liberal appropriation-- have been made
every year to the improvement oí navy yards,
the construction of dry docks,whatves ship houses,
the purchase of ordnance, nival stores, &e &c.
Besides all this, the report of the Secretary cnows
that arrangements have been nude, whuh tvill
enable the Government, at a very short nonce,
should the situation of the country demand i', to
put in commission—
15 Ships of the line
18 Frigates
15 Sloops of war
9 Steamers.
9 Brigs and Schooners
The materials for these vessels  ere being pre-
pared, and whenever a war is apprehended, they
can, in a very snort time, be put upon the ocean
In a few months a naval force coald be set in mo-
tion, amply sufficient to defend the American fljg,
wherever it may be assailed     In the face of the
facts which have been given, gentlemen of the o her
party ask too much, when they  require us lo be-
lieve that the navy is in a "ruinous and dilapida-
ted condition "    Ño, sir, the charge is untrue  T le
navy has not been neg'ect d, but, on the contrary,
has been gradually mereastae, and gentlemen wnl
set , if we are involved in a war, another exhibiuon
of that daring intiepidity and unflimhing courage,
which characterized the Am-ncan  tars m 1312
Your navy has yet many a gallan' hero who would
willingly throw hi nself in as  a s¡ ed between his
country and dishonor.   Trie "rum an 1 dilapida
tion" about which we heird so rn icno'i vest r l¿y,
will be found to ettst no whe,e, but in the treated
imag nations of vindictive f anisáis
I will not (said Mr W) unde take to ?--
cube motives to gentlemen of the Whig par-
ty, for the c urse they are nov pur^u'Dg,
but this much I sav, that their constant cffoits to
extend tie appropriations beyond the psnnaes
sboi? conclusively that they have f bardo i d al
their notions ab nt econony and (hit so far from
reducing the expendimos ot tve Qovermien , (^s
they prom sed before the election,) they intend to
increase them Prior to the late Presidential dec
tion, yen harangued the people about the expenses
of the Government, and no dojb , induced many
honest men, who did not understand your p op'n
sUy, to believe that the present Administration had
squandered the public money Now, it is said we
have been "parstmMiiotts" and "mean," that we
have Deg ected the navy and suffered it te fa 1 into
a "dilapidated condition " Ihese charges are now
made for the purpose of justifying you, if possible,
in the large apprapnations you intend to make
You say )ou do not ask a tariff for protection, bat
you will take care to extend tne appropriations to
an amount suffic ent to make it necessary to keep
up a high tariff in order to defray ¡he expensas of
the Government When a Urge national debt is
«addled upon the peop e, er when tbey are op-
pressed ard crushed to the earth by an onerous
tariff, the impolicy of the course you are
no*- pur uing will be made manifest—then
your constituents will ask whether this is
the reform you promised tb/m before they en-
trusted you with power. When you shall hive
increased the expenditures to forty millions the
friends of economy wdl find how much they have
made by placing jour party at the head of tne Go
vern-nent. Two years will be amply suffic ent to
expose your shallow trickery Bat (said Mi W )
I do nor wish to iay any thing to provoke farther
discussion My only object in n  ng was to cor
rcxt the gross errors < f some of the gentlemen who
preceded me in relation to th  present condition of
tne navy, and to mvrke all patties Jo suffer the
debate to close, and the vo'e to be taken The party
discuss oni which interfere si muc wi h the busi-
ness of this House, ought to be dropped lor the
lemainderof the session In oilier words, let us
quit talking, and spend the balance of oar timem
voting.

Mr Chakman I have contented my«e'f,>,hereio-

on all Inequations Tvlmh have been brought up
for the consideration ot this House, nor vtoull I,
on tne present occasion, devt-'e 'rom that line ol

discission deeply affecting the interests and wel
fare of my const tuenls 1 know well the paity
organization of th s Hcuv—the blmdnes , dtat-
ness, anl stubbornness it engenders, I know the
impotence of argument a-d the futility of reason
and prmcip'e here, but my cons ltnenls do n I, ami
tbey expect me, franily and openly, tj miel these
various questions an 1 maintain their imprests I
yield not with the view of ethibi ing my poor
powers, nor with the h pe of winning pro elytes to
my view  here, but that they may know whit
course duty required me to take on thtsc qu°s

The authorizing t' e issu of ii re million^ of
Treasury n trs has now become a subject, com-
paratively, of mioor trapor ice Otbei great and

Tne Ct airman ot the C mmiltee of Wijs and
Means [Vír I nf^] s a ed ta¿>t the revenue t f the
Govermmn' v s leceived \biy megilarly, that,
owing to the credit allows 1 on ci turns during th*
fi ot quarter tf th<- year th  receipts of the Gove n-
ment were v <\<\\y trie tmahest, -nil, during the
same tttnr, its i ubu-sementj wvre the luge t
This fact rendered i nece^ary, when th^ annual
income of the Government was about equal to lis
annual expenditure, as was now the case, to make
some provision to enable the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, on an emergency, when the current reve-
nue was not sufficient to me t the demands against
tne Government, to raí e money to fave «he
honor and credit of the United States. That ihts
is the case during the first quarter of this year, s
a fact admitted on all sides Tne Secretary of the
Treasury has repeatedly asked for a permanent
law, to give full an 1 free ac ton to his department,
but this has not been granted, and hence the nece -
sity of this bill as a temporary law. But the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr Barnard] proposes
a plan to obv ite this difficulty, lo wkw.ii 1 dissent
altoge her, and that is, to keep five millions of
dodetrv a'ways in th  Treasury, and lhat the honor
ol the Government is not safe without it Sir, I
would be willing ( aid Mr T ) if it were at all
practicable, thit trie Treasurer of the United
Sta es, at the clove of each day, should strike a
balance between the debits and credits upon hts
books. I prefer for him to strain a point to make
th  ends m=et, rsther than to luxuriate in plenty,
and ne\er apprehend want I feel unwilling for
any set of public officeis to hold the money oí this
Government when there is no probability that, at
any eaily day, it will b dem*n"ed Tnat feeling
alon will constitute then strongest temptation to
mismanagement and corruption
The necessity of íaising monev to meet the«xi
genctesof this quarter heng admitted, whjt is the
proper mode of affording reliei' By a loan, or in
the manner proposed?
A 1 who have addressed Ihe committee on either
side admit the power of C ingress, under the Cos
stuution, to au hor f ih° í^sae of bonds, scrip, or
promissory notes, as a means of raising monsy, ex-
c pt tha h morable gentleman from S uth Caioh
na, [M- lnsMPsoN ] Anl he, with a mgular air
of tuurnph, asserts that his argument as to the
constitu lonelily of Treasury notes, deliveied dur-
ing a precedng Congress, has never been success-
fully answered.
bir, (said Ir T ) it is not my object, to answer
the argument of the gentleman, but it is my inten-
tion to examine this quest on to a sufficient extent
foaatisfy my own mind The Constitution be ngt
j^powetot attorney under which we act, and a*
Atrict an(l uniform a^heren e lo its provision's being

ments, me i, md e I, a e the days of the R pubhc

No provi ion in ihj Constitution is more exp'ieit
than this power to borrnv monej, yet, to exerci e
thi^ grant when the income of th3 Government
was amply suffieiejt to me°t its demands, would
be agro? anl palpable infraction of t'-e genius
