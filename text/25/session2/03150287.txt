himself, his country, and his God, because it had
been suggested by honorable Senators that jnrors
would not convict, and the Executive would par-
don where convictions should be had He had
resolved in his own mind to be governed by no such
considerations He would do his duty, and let the
responsibility re&t with those were charged with the
execution of the laws With them and the people
be it. He would satisfy his own conscience, and
represent what be believed to be the opinion of his
State on this subject. Let others do the same, and
the law1 will not only be passed, but he fully be-
lieved it would be executed should xts provisions be
violated
The common law will still be left in full force
The bill doe* not contemplate interfering with the
common law offence, or the common law punish-
ment. It steers clear of the common law, and cre-
ates and punishes, with imprisonment in the peni-
tentiary, the offence of challenging, accepting or
carrying a challenge, or aiding, or abetting in it,
or posting, or publishing any person who may have
refused to accept a challenge or fight a duel In a
word, the bill punishes all the preliminary steps to
the final duel It meets the offender at the thresh-
hold, and says to him, stop in your mad, in your un-
lawful, jour unholy career You are treading on
ground covered with ignominy and penalties You
must surrender your code of honor, and submit to
the laws of that society under which you enjoy all the
blessings that surround you Take not vengeance
into your own hands You shall not assail the life ef
a fellow-being Nor shajl you wantonly put your
own life at hazard All the States had laws similar
to the bill before the Senate The people had dt-
manded these laws The District of Columbia
alone remained unprotected And shall this Dis-
trict be left the only spot m the nation in which this
work of destruction, this waste of human life, this
violation of the laws of God and man, shall be to-
lerated and suffered to be earned on with impunity?
It was already said that this was an asylum for all
manner of wickedness and crime, that members of
Congress, when here, were removed fiom those le-
gal restraints under which they act in the States
lrom which they came Shall Congress give coun-
tenance to this statement, by refusing to come up
to this mark, at least to the extent that the States
have gone' He hoped not It was here that much
nwght be done to aid public opinion He had lit-
tle doubt but that the effect of the opinion of Con-
gress on this subject will be greater on the public
mind than even the penal enactments of the bill
Shall Congress not, then, set the example''shall its
members not throw their influence into the scale of
morality and religion, and do all m their power to
arrest this bloody, this inhuman custom5
It has been contended that if we pass this law,
the freedom of debate will degenerate into licen-
tiousness and personal abuse , tint if Senators and
Representatives in Congress are not to be held per-
sonally responsible to the injured party for woids
spoken here of a personal character, the debates
will become personal, vindictive, and insufferable
Mi S could not come to that oono'usion He
thought the passage of the bill would have a salu-
tary effect on the debates Fie was, howevei, not
willing, in the first place, to presume that any
member of Congress would be will ng to hazard
his reputation so far as to viólale that decorum
which is due to himself and the body of which he
is a member, in a manner to require personal satis-
faction, and in the next place he thought it would
be so obvious to every one that attempted such a
course, that the aggressor would be the sufferer in
the opinion ol the body to which he belonged,
that the unruly tongue would be sufficiently
bridled without a resoit to that misnamed code
ot honor under which the duellist seeks <a'is-
faction for his real or supposed wrongs No
man of respectability would venture his repu-
tation bj attacking, with calumm, a mem-
ber thus situated But again Was there no
other way of meeting the tongue of the slanderer
than by a resort to deadly weapon ? Was there
no othci remedy but to take the life of the de-
famer, or suffer your own to be taken by him,
to satisfy the bloody requirements of this fanoied
code'?   Surely there was   oppose truth  to false-

hood decorum to indecorum, and public opinion
will always prove a more salutary and efficient
protection to the chaiacler ot the assailed than all
the duels in the world hive ever done
It had been suggested m debate, that members
who vote for this bill may be charged with asking
a protection for their persons and characters, which
they have not the moral courage to defend He
thought there was nothing m this The moral
courage of members of Congress was not so much
doubted as was their prudent forbearance to bring
that courage to the test on trivial occasions Few
men lack courage certainly more lack prudence
It had been wisely said, that true courage is not
always found in i ash adventures, nor does it follow
that there is a defect of moral courage, where indi-
viduals refuse to recognise that sanguinary and in-
human custom, that elites its origin in the dark and
barbarous ages, and which must, sooner or later, be
entirely driven, by the force of morality, religion,
law, and public opinion, from the shores of this
enlightened nation, to hide its hideous face in the
darker portions of the pagan world
Senators who concur m the opinion that the cus-
tom of duelling was wholly indefensible, and ought
to be arrested, still insisted that Congress cannot,
by its action, effect a remedy They contend that
the common law, punishing the crime with death,
cannot be enforced, tint public opinion is against
it To this it may be answered that the public
mind seems naturally lo recoil from capital punish-
ment, and all manner of excuses and doubts are
throw n into the scale of the defendant on the trial,
and every pretext is sought by the Executive to
justify the exercise of his clemency The exemp-
tion from punishment not unfrequently arises from
the awful nature of the punishment inflicted Hu-
manity shudders at the punishment of death, and
mercy, the darling attribute of Deity, exercises, in
those cases where that punishment is inflicted a
powerful influence over the human mind Ad-
mitting, then, all that his been slated as to the
difficulty of enfoicmg the common law, it does
not follow that Congress should not do all
m its power to prevent ihe final catastrophe
by punishing the preparatory acts, by providing a
punishment piopomoned to the enormity of ihe
offence, by making the whole transaction mlamous,
from its inc pient stiges to the last act in tnc tra-
gedy, by presenting a legal code, miking that mla-
mous which this false code of honor makes honora-
ble It is highly piobable tint cases would occur,
in despite of all the laws there could be enacted
Such was the case with evtiy other crime, and
why should it not be so with this'! There were mo-
ments in the lives of men, when, owing lo some
great exciting cinsc, they became alike reckless of
human and divine laws, and íashly set both at
elefimee But this admission is no argument
against this bill that will not hold against all crimi-
nal laws with equal torce We are notified of the
cases that do occur, and they make an impression
on our minds, while ihe thousands that aie pie
vented by oui laws are unknown and unobserved
In the casi- rf duelling, Congress may not be
able to prevent the commission ol the offence m ill
cases Desperate men, it is to be feared, will div-
resardall law, humin and divine, and madl) rnsn
on to their mm destruction But it is he duty of
Congress, within i s constitutional powers, to throw
every obstacle in the w aj or these eieeds of despe-
ration If one victim can be saveel, if one innocent
family can be rescued, 1/a widow's tears and her
orphans' cries can be turned into joy and blessings
on >our head, you will have received a high re-
ward in the approbation   of your own consciences
After some remarks from Mr PRESTON,
Mr SEVIER sud that a thou°h 1 e w «s no ft ierd

it to the other He belieied it was a bill wholly
for the protection of members cf Congre* , who

be the consequence'! Why, something like the
affair of Houston and Stansbury, the injured
man will take the lawinto his own hands chastise
the triducer, and then he will be brought up to
the bar of the House, fiom whence, after five or
six weeks are unprofitably consumad in the exami-
nation, he will be dismissed with a reprimand.
This bill was avowedly made to protect members
of Congress, and to protect them from what? Why
to protect them in abusing their masters—the peo*
pie who sent them here It amounted to this, and
no more Individuals coming to this city, or re-
siding here, may go out and fight, and be killed
too, and nething is said of it, but let a member of
Congress be killed in a duel, or be whipped m the
streets, or kicked out of a boarding house, and the
business of the nation must be set aside to legislate
on it If the object was solely to suppress duelling
and not for the protection of the members, why
not pass a law to prevent it in our other Territories
as well as m the District of Columbia? Why not
include Wisconsin and Flewida, and our forts and
arsenals' He thought this District was already
sufficiently disfranchised, and he would not add
any more to its disabilities Members of Congress
might talk of Tom, Dick, or Harry, as they pleased,
and could not be sued for slander, and now they
would take away from the injured individual the
only remedy lait him I am opposed, continued
Mr S to passing laws for our own protection, be-
cause if you pass one, the same reasons will ope-
rate m passing another, and the next time Mr.
Stansberry, or Mr any-body-else, is whipped by
Houston, every member of Congress must have a
corporal's guaid to protect him m passing from his
boarding house to the Capitol Now he would ask
if the people of the United Slates would be willing
to be taxed for any such pmpose, for it would take
at least three thousand men to furnish a corporal's
guard to each member, and they must therefore
have an additional army, or leave the frontiers ex-
posed He was satisfied that more impoitance was
attached to this subject than it deserved, and he
believed out of one thousand duels, nine out of
eveiy ten of them were fought for causes that
could not be got over any other way He knew
that duels were frequently fought for trivial causes,
but he was convinced that it was otherwise in a,
va>t majority of cases He held himself responsi-
ble for every thing He said on that floor, and he
would not give a vote to take away that responsi-
bility He did not by this, mean to say that he
would fight every body or nobody, that he would
think of when the occasion leqmreel, but this he
did say, that he was not going to shield himself by
his vote on this bill from the consequences that
might be brought on him by his own language-
After some further remarks from Mr S —
The question was taken on Mr Cl.avton's
amendment, and it was lost—yeas 12, nays 20, as
follows
YEAS—Messrs Clay of Alabama, Clayton,
Pulton, Grundy, Linn, Nicholas, Norvell, Robin-
son, Strange, Trotter, Walker, and VVhite—12

The question then recurring on the amendment
of the Committee on the Juuiciarv, which substi-
tutes for the punishment of death, as in the bill,
imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term not
le«s than ten, nor more than twenty, years
Mr SMITH of Indiana moved to amend by
making the imprisonment not less than five, nor
more than twent;, j tirs, w hit h  vas agreed to
Mr NORVELL moved furthei to amend by
striking out ♦ \entj jcars and inserting ten, which
was also carried
Mr NILES moved fmther to amerd the bill, by
pro\ idmg that the persons offending under this act
shall be for ever incapable of holding any office or
Appointment under the authority of the United
States
Mr NORVELL thought they had carried the
matter far enough They subjected the man guilty
of duelling to a punishment of not less than five,
nor more than  ten, yean' imprisonment m the
