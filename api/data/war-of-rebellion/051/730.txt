Generals Wheeler and Lee since starting back from Winchester and Salem.

I went to see General Wheeler last night, and proposed if he would give me one Kentucky regiment or battalion I would undertake to so destroy the enemy's communications that if I lose my brigade I will have sold out at a good price. He declined. If, however, you will trust me thus far, I will undertake it at short warming, and feel confident will damage him greatly, thereby assist in compelling him to fall back from Chattanooga.

Hoping I have answered your communication satisfactorily, I remain, as ever, yours, truly,

P. D. RODDEY,

Brigadier-General.

General BRAGG.
