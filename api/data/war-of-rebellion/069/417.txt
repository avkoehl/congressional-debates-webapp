WASHINGTON, D. C., May 31, 1864-3 p. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER AT FORT MONROE:

The steamer Victor was to leave New York on the 25th, and the steamer Sentinel on the 30th, for this city. They have on board sixty pontoons. If you can intercept these vessels, their bridge equipage will be sent, as before ordered, up the James River.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

FORT MONROE, May 31, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

This* came from Grant via Yourktown this evening. Our building party is now 17 miles beyond Gloucester Point. They have seen some rebel pickets, and I fear the line will be cut unless well picketed. We hope to reach White House and beyond in two days more.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

I have this moment received your dispatch of 8.20 last evening, inclosing dispatch from Admiral Lee and your reply, and will give the matter my immediate attention.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-8.15 a. m.

General BUTLER,

Commanding:

We cannot afford efficient help to the navy with our guns on the bluff. The position is too high for effective fire. It is possible that a battery can be placed at the mouth of the ravine on my right, by constructing a road down the ravine, but a battery there would be of no assistance against a land attack. Would you be willing to put a battery down there, if it can be done? I have ordered the 20-pounder battery to Curtis' house.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

POINT OF ROCKS, May 31, 1864-12 m.

General GILLMORE:

I am no engineer, but still must insist that the bluff near Curtis', which is about 50 feet high, is the place for the 20-pounders to aid the navy. At 5 degrees their range is 2,100 yards. To attack Admiral Lee, the rebels must come around Dutch Gap and Farrar's
