FALMOUTH, June 11, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

As near as I can find out, General Hobson's command was very hard pushed, if not captured entire. It is reported that Garis, One hundred and sixty-eighth Ohio, and Colonel Berry, of the militia, were both killed. * The Canton operator was among them some time, but heard nothing of General Hobson. A man of One hundred and sixty-eighth Regiment, dressed in citizen's clothing, was also among them, and they told him they had caught Hobson and 800 men.
