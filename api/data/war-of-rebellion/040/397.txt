captured from the enemy this morning in front of and in Fredericksburg to be brought to this side of the river.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAY 3, 1863-4.05 p.m.

General HOOKER:

Gibbon's division still in and around Fredericksburg. Shall it be pushed after Sedgwick or remain here?

BUTTERFIELD.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-5.40 p.m.

General JOHN GIBBON:

The orders of the commanding general stated that you were to cross and occupy Fredericksburg last night. I presume he left you to the disposition of General Sedgwick. I have telegraphed him concerning it. How many guns and prisoners did Sedgwick get? Make strong exertions with a view to to-morrow's operations.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 3, 1863-6.20 p.m.

General GIBBON:

General Hooker wishes you kept at Fredericksburg.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA., May 3, 1863.

Brigadier-General GIBBON:

Reports of signal officers make a cavalry force opposite to Reynolds' crossing a battery near Captain Hamilton's crossing, and two regiments of infantry supporting it. At 1 p.m. a brigade of infantry that were out as skirmishers retired, going back over the hill, and no trains in (to rebel railroad station, I suppose) since 1 p.m. Is this a force of about a brigade and a battery cut off by Sedgwick's assault and separated from his prisoners, or is it a force probably left to guard their supply depot? I have been so busy every moment with matters of detail that I have hardly had time to think of it. Keep a watch on this force and its movements. Their main army was all in front of General Hooker at noon to-day. To-night Sedgwick has some portion, I know not what, in front of him. Keep your orderlies on hand to post me quickly, so that the general may be informed of all that transpires.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
