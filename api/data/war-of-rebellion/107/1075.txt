HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS,July 12, 1863.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I notice that a brigade of new troops has re-enforced the First Corps this morning. I think mine now is the only corps that has not been strenghtened, but however that may be it will increase the efficiency of this corps move than proportionally to the number of troops sent. If I could have only one regiment to a division it would do me much good, so that if is possible for me to be re-enforced I entreat this for the benefit of the service. I have one regiment whose time is out on the 14th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.
