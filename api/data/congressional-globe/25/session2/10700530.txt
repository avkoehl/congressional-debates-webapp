St lie* united caa do nothing which it is not expressly autho
i i/ed by the bond of uaion between the States to do It is by
these 1 rmciples of constitutional law I propose to test the sti
pnlauons of the compact with the Western States
We wit'now proceed to notice the provisions of that compact
By an act of Congress m ISO9, authonzing Ohio to foim a
S ite Constitution, and entei the Union on an equal footing with
¡ e original S a es the following piopoaitions waesubmittedto
the oeo 'e oí Ohi > lor their acceptance or reaction, which, if
arcepteJ were tobe obligatory upon the United States 1st To
si anoto the inhabitants of each township, foi the use oí schools,

acres oi Und in J being the one thirty sixth part of all public
lauds within the limit*, of the tetate, mclulmg the reservations
by Virginia a¿id the United States tor military bounties, and
1 -to the 'Connecticut reserve," as well as the lands belonging

t* the State fox the uoe of the people thereof all the salt spi mgs

smu the opnngs to be subject to the control of the Legislature
1 the "state -vith a prohibition to sell or lea&e the s me foi a
Jrn"ei pern 1 than ten years 3d To reserve and apply five
y ^r cent (which is equalto one twentieth part) of the nett pio
cpcIs of the public lands lying within the State, and sold by
Con^res , to the laying out and making public loads leading
Í > n the navigable waters of the Atlantic to the State of Ohio
sue1) loads tobe laid out under the authority of Congress, witn
tie eansent of the several States through which the roa is shall
pa=*R This last proposition was subsequently modified, and
ren iered more beneficial to Ohio, by an act of Congress, m 1803,
ihrectmg the Secretary of the Treasury to pay over to the State
«,!iree per ce it of the f)ve pei cent, fund to be expended under
&e authority of the State m making roade m the State, Con
gie sstillíeseiYingtwo per cent of that fund, to beapplied,
under itsamhoiity, it laying out and making roads leading to
the state auch were the pi «positions submitted by Conferee
to the people of Ohio foi their acceptance, and since then to all
the other Mates oi the West that have been admitted mto the
Union, which piopositions have been actepted by the people
ot those ¡states on the condition** proposed, by virtue of which it
ib now contended that Congress 1  still bound to make appro
pria ion  foi tht Cumbeiland road
It 1** manifest that thebe stipulations, on the put of Con
grps-j, operite e\clusively for the benefit oi the new States of
ihe West, unless the States enjoying these advantages have 11
lieu thereof, rendered to this Government some equivalent in
which all the othei S'a'es have paiticipated I contend that,
wi hout an equivalent, the value of these benefits besides ithei
laige donations of land^, amounting mall to millions of dol'ais
to each of the new States, may be proptily regaideei (lie vuy
same ab so much money drawn miectíy from he Treasury <f
the United feutes and bestowed as a meie gntuiiv upon a few
fivmed Statps Ihe public lands and the money hi the Tiet
sur> raided by taxation aie alike the funds of the (i<_ vern iient,
in which all the States are equally mteiested, and are subject
to the same consti utional restnetmns in disbursements 'lhis
is appa'cntfi im the very natureof the transaction, with legard
to all the lands belonging to the Uni ed states that have hppn
acquned by punhise and paid for out of the common fund of
the States And it is ais > no less apparent, fiom ihe language
enip oyed in the seveial deed-> of transfers, with regaid to all
tht lands that hive been acquired by cession from the oiismal
S ales In the one 01 the other of these two ways, the t jtted
States have acquired all the right they possess to the public
tbmain As a proof of the fact that the lands acquired hy c* s
sion weie conveyed m tuir-t for the common benefit ai d m p'
poit of all the States of the Union, and so received by the ex
piess s ipubtions nf Co igress, we need only refer to the deed*,
themselves Jn the deed of cession from Virginia of ail the
¡an lb within hei chatteied limits lying northwest of the nvei
Ohio and now embraced in the States of Ohio Indiana, Ilhno ,
and Michigan, the fo lowing strong "nd unequivocal language
is use 1, tier I irative of her intentions
That dll iht* lands, within the tuniory so ceded to the Uni
ted Skips, and no'reserved f>i or tppropnaterl to any oí ihe
before menu ned pui poses, (reservation of hounty land" etc >
shall be considered as a common fund for the ?/se and benefit
of b«/7/ of the United State** as have becon< ,01 shall become,
member-* ofthe Conkderauon, or Tederal alliance of ihe said
States, \ irginta inclusive, a"coi hrg to their usual respective
pi ipoitions in the et neial charge of expenditure, and shiij be
faithfully and bona fide disposed of for thaf purpose anil for
«9 othei utp oxpurpotp whatsoever "
It is true this dee was executed m ihe yeai 1784, and his
reference nits prov ions to the then state of things, when fon
giess under the old articles of confederation, not pus->essii)g f he
power to raise levenue by taxation, each State had to contri
bote its quota todehay the expenses of the Confederation But
njtwithstanhng this Government has since then undeigvme, 11
many respects, a matenal change, yet the claims of the State-,,
by virtue of the deed of cession upon these lands as a common
fund, and the obligation of Congiess faithfully to execute u*
ttust remain the same,ifthe> are not conci lertbly a'ienfft'ienel
by a Oesh recognition off heir existence an 1 validity in our pre
sent Constitution The only mention made of the public 11 1 '-*
m the Constitution  whe#ct vsedenve om present pown-s   is
II  he found in the M section of the 4th article, which piowdi-.
in thebC woids
1 he Conareos shall have pewei to dispose of and mie alf
ntediul rules and regulations respecting the temtoiy 01 o hn
rioperty belonging to the United States and nothing m his
i 00 tit ifion «I a 1 be «o consti ued as to prejudice any claims 01
the ISitfd MATrs or of any particular te'ate '
That the ughis of the States and tne power ofOoirrress with
legaid to the public lane's acquued bv cession aie ihe same
now a& under (he oldaiticles of confederation may be fuither
illustrated hy the conditions of the agreement between the
I 111 ted States and the ¡state of Georgia, by which the United
States acquned their qualified right to the lands now inci uled
III the States of Alabama and Mississippi In this agreement,
bearing date in the year 1S02 and raufu 4 by an act of Congress,
under the present Constitution, Georgia expressly declares,
"that all the lands ceded oy this agreement to the I nned State
Georgia included shall be considered as a common fund foi
the use and benefit of the United States, and shall be faithfully
dispíi>ed nf fot that put pose ani foi no othe m.e 01 putposc
whattver ' Such is the tenure by which this Government
holds all that portion ol the public domain which has been ac
quired by separate deed-, of cession from the several Statea uf
\irjmii Geoigia South Carolina, Noith Carolina, isewYoik,
M issachusetfs, and Í onnecticut
With these facts, as «uleinn ma ters of recoid, staring ua in
the face can it be contended that the compact of this Govern
ment with the individual States of the West is not m direct
violation of the plighted faith of the Goverrment to the ongi
nil States of toe Unions Can thaf tnnd, with any degree of
proprietv be a*vy longer called common^ which either by the
legislation or contract of this Government, has been rendeied,
in the strictest sense of the word, special? It can be shown
that the single State of Ohio his aheady iaceived fiom this
Government, in addi'nn to the 0 le thirty s xth part of all the
public lands lying within hei chartered limits, and the one
twentieth of the nett pioeeeds of such lands at, have been s id,
donations fiom time to time of these very lands dcignafd in
ihe deed of cession from Virginia ab a common fwnd, amount
ing in number to 1,5U 555 acies beside  millions of money by
way of direct appiopnations fiom the Treasury and all (¿t the
avowed local purptseb of hei schools and internal improve
mentb Will any one pretend to call this a faithful application
ot the "common fund," foi the use and benefit of the United
Mate , especially when it can be also shown that some of fhes~
United States, of which south Caiolma is one, have nevei yet
received from this fund, foi these or anv other purnosrsof a
local chaiacter the value of one cent, either m land or nicneyi
What lbtiue with regard to Ohio i^true with restart! to Indiana
an 1 Illinois, and, to some extent, all the Suites of the We-, ex
cept Tenne^ee and Kentucky Under this state of futa,
sure v no o c will presume to contend that the United States
have shired alike of this common fund, unless some one is
prepared to demonstrate to the House the absurd prjpcsition
that a part is equal to the whole Trom these considerations, I
am forced to conclude that the couise of policy pursued by this
Government, with regard to the public lands, has been illiberal
and unjust to the parent States, extravagant to the new States
then offspring, and not wan anted etthei by the compact he
tw^ei the Si ilea., 0' which this Government is hut the creature
and agent, or by the several compacts betw ten this Government
and the original S a'es   by virtue of-which the public 1 nda
have been acquued
I am aware that each of the Western States, m its engage-
mentb with this Government, has provided by an ordinance, ir
levocable without the conse it of ihe United Sta es, * that each
and eveiy tract of land «¡oh] by Congiess shall be and remain
exempt from anv tax laid by oider 01 under the authouty ot
th*1 in ate, whether for State, coun'v, township or any other
puipose whatevei, for the teimo1" fiyeyears fiomafidafiei the
day of sale ' It 1^ contendí d that this resection upon the
power of theS'atts to rm e revenue by taking the lands, unfit
the lao-.£ of fiv e years af'ei ihei ca!e, t pera es to the injury of
the new S'a cs; and to the benefit of the United States; wmcjft
benefit is fully equal to all tiie advantages they derive from the
compact
I can conceive of no object which the Uni ed States cou'd
1 have had m iequinng*his s ípuiation on behalf of the new
** atts unle-s to m luce em gration and thereby effect a more
-.peeov sale of the f Lhhc lamí1? V\ hatever may have been
ihe object, that such has been, to a certain extent, the imraedi-
a e consequence of this pohev, none can doubt how, let us

Henee the corollary, that whatever encourages die progress of
population in a nation encourages thai of real wealth and
greatness
According to these yipvvs it is manifest that the United States,
as 01 e natim, as well as each individual State, are all alike most
deeply in erected in whatevei policy tends to the increase of
thpit population In this the Western fctates have been highly
favored by the action of Congress, m ho ding out to mankind
the strongest inducements to emigrate, which have been afford
ed m the mere nominal puce Of the most fertile lands, the
lights oi pre empuon, and thp immense donations of lands and
. exti avagant appropi íations fiom the Treasury for their schools

01 no a Mitior to then ¡ opulatmn, as one gteat nation by emi
giation from abroad, while the mo*t important change has
been pnduced in the condition and relative powei of the indi-
vidual Stages, morely by ihe removal of the peepie from one
State to another Theaupenor advantages offered m the West,
hy ne paitial legislation of Congiess, have foiced the stream ol
emigra 1 in to flow thithei from the 0 ismal States bordering
on the Atlantic Tl us bolh the "trength and resiurcesot the
General Government have been greatly impure! in that very
poi ion of our common cotinti y where the dancéis fromloieign
aggressions are the moa threatening, and where the resources
o¡ the Government are most nee led not only m the time of
war, to repel Invasion but also m the time of peace, to aid m
that commerce with the world from which the chief support of
Go-vernmenr is at all times del \ed, and m which all the States
of the Union are vitally mteiested
Nor is. thisa'l Ihe strength and resomces of the United
States have not onl> been impaired in the Atlantic States, by a
m^ieiemoval of their people to the West but also by the 1
di-per-uon ovei an almost boundless extent of teintory, and
the withdrawal 01 a vast amount o*" eapual from the acfive
businesb of Me, peculiar to a dense population, and the invest
ment of that capital in the purchase of lands, merely with a
view to futuic speiulatioii, which, foi the Viant of means to
cultivate, mustrprnam foi ages unimpioved and unproductive
to the country
While the ^eneial merest of the United States has been hus
imnred, the evil effects upon -¡orne ot th° paient States of the
Union have been almost mea'culable This, has been the ne
ce^ary consequence of thai, mle of loss and ga n by which
this Gov eminent, a& the joint deent of a concern m which all
the Mates, as part ps aie al ke interested, has decreed that one
set of the copaituers shall enjoy all the profits, while another
set equally it not more meruonous and de^ervi^g are doomed
to sustain the entie lose Foi a proof of this fact, look at
Sou h Carolina thirty eight years agü, while moot of the vast
legion^ of the West, now thriving State, were unmaited by
tht footsteps t f civilized man , and compaie her condition then
with her condition in 1^0 when hn last census w?s tairen
