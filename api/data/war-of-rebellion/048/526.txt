Pond Mountain if he can, but I fear he cannot escape the enemy's cavalry. I have telegraphed General Lee, asking for aid. Will need all I can get. No time to lose.

Echol's brigade is nearly destroyed. I have but two regiment of infantry, two batteries, and a battalion of cavalry between enemy and railroad. Send re-enforcements if possible. Enemy estimated at 7,000. They were at Lewisburg yesterday.

Unless local-defense men and militia can be had, there is no re-enforcements possible, and it only remains to concentrate on the best position and make intrenchments, if they will avail. I suppose General Ransom is advised, and, if practicable, will co-operate.

The enemy in large force encamped at Burnt Bridge, Greenbrier River, last night. Their movements not yet sufficiently developed to enable me to judge of their plans and purposes. Echols, with the remnant of his brigade, was at Salt Pond Mountain last night. It is in no condition to fight. I have asked for re-enforcements, and am sure you will send them if you can.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

SALT POND MOUNTAIN,

November 10, 1863.

Your telegram received. I regret that you cannot send me re-enforcements. General Echols' brigade has not, I think, lost as heavily in killed and wounded as I at first supposed. One battalion was not engaged, and is approaching this place by way of Sweet Springs. Ought to be in to-day. Stragglers and absentees are coming in, and I think Echols will have them in fighting condition in a few days.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
