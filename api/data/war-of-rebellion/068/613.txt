HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,Alsop's House, May 10, 1864.

General WILLCOX,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: I am very much gratified with the management of your command and desire to express my thanks for the service already performed. I sincerely hope the wound of General Stevenson may not prove fatal. It is reported that the main road from Spotsylvania Court-House to Fredericksburg crosses the road to your position and is only lightly blockaded. If such is the case, it is very necessary a strict watch should be kept up on that road. I will send you one or two regiments at once.

Very truly, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
