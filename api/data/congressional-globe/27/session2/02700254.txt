thus vindicate the character oí the House, and maintain its re-

the better attributes of the American people—of their tempe

all thedomestic and public virtues thatdistmguish them among
the nations of the earth, rather than by any of then bau pas
sions, and to make it thus, he would go with the gemleman
froaTVlrginia, and all other*, with heart and hand, but he
•would notgo with him, or any other, m any attempt, from any
feeling of 'esprit du corps," to conceal its vices or apologize
for its disorders Such a course could not obtain for it there

otlices    Thev comedown to him fiom hi-   tclccessors who
haveiendeif ] themselves illustrious, at tea t in tins, tha^ they
have not only filled all the offices unJei them created by law
but have created two more, fixed their salaries, had them insert-
ed m the general appropriation hill, and carried them success-
fully through I fe^l proud to bear testimony to the high qua-
lification of the piesent Clerk, and his eminent fitness for the
office But I cannot go with the gentleman from New York,
who thinks his letter on this subject should decide the question
We have the icport of the committee against this letter of the
Clerk, which, with me, will preponderate The facts and rea-
sonmgof the committee are satisfactory, and the committee
should be sustained
If the opinions oi those who hold office at Washington are to
govern, no doubt those who create ofhees will be in favor of
sustaining them Their opinion has been strongly expressed,
mthebuipnsmg power they have assumed, and it is scarcely
to be hoped that they wilt change their opinions un'il Consress
shall act in the subject They claim that theitcomse has been
sanctioned by usage, and what wasonce usurpation has become
law And if this Congress, now that this subject has been
biought directly before them, shall refuse to expíese its dieap-
ptobation oí this flagrant usmpation oi power, m future offices
will spung up without numbei Oflicesabeady authorized by
law will have their salariesmerea&ed, and the control of Execu
tive power will become absolute
Sn how has this, change in the simplicity and integuty of the
admmibtiation o! the Government beeninttodt ced? It has been
done by seciet, covert influences, that the public eye could not
rest upon The increase of offices and increase of expenditures
have been been, but tespcnubility could be fixed on no one
When the Administration was charged with extravagance, it
was replied that no money could be expended except by th©
sanction ol Congress, and the people weie told to lecture their
Representatives The people would arraign their Representa
tive0) and the defence would be, that they t rdy voted tor gene
lalappiopnatious  uch is were called foi by the President and
^ecittanes in then "eucial estimates That to vote against the
^eneiii appiopnauon bilH would be Jacuous and would, if
ueccbfcfn!, stop the whteU of Government And upon this the
Repiescntativt íested his defence The result was that respon
sibihty could be fixed no where
The patty then in powei declared that no abuses existed The
Whigs (the Opposition) declared they did exist The party m
power tauntingly replied Then find them if you can* Show
them to the people1
Now whatOnqnnedMr B ) does this investigation reveal i
It reveals this astonishing fact That "many appropriations
haxe heretofore been made without authority oflawfor a se
ríes of yeais>} Yes, sir, offices ere tted, salanes fixed, and
those that were fixed incieased , and all this without autbonty
of law1
Can gen lemen escape this? Will they now say that there
have bttn no abuses? lain glad to see that som* of those
who acted with the late paiíy m power will not take this
giound
^ii, how wis thiE-abu e kept fn m light so long 7 It is now,
foituniteiy foi the countiy, understood anil expect to heai
someof those who weie tugged in the cotceilment and fraud
upon the public confidence, to cry "catch the logue" at the top
ot their lunab The report of the committee to which I have
lefeued fully shows how this concealment was effected The
offices wei e ci eate (, the salaries fixed, -md other salaries raised
at the discretion of the head" of the jJepaitments, and then the
gross amount foi clerk hue &c was inserted in the general
estimates and transferred to ihe general appropriation bills,
and passed, when peí haps not one thi i d of those who voted
fot them undo stood the concealed fraud Most of the mem-
berb of (. ongic-sj at least those attached to the Admin strauon,
voted ioi the appiopnation bills ™ doubt believing—yes, ho
nebdy bohevint— thit all was right It may be said that Con
Ljessshoul 1 have investigated the mattei This is true But
the fi ion is í t t'ie Adtmnistiation were too confidm? to inquire
íi sides had they done <-o, and discc\eicd and disclosed any
tiling that wab unfavoiable to the Admmistrition, they would
hive b on shot down as de&eiteis The Whigs, with the
' lights" then beioie them," could do nothing They were
deprived of the lights which a more intimate association with
the Cabinet, and a knowledge oí Cabinet seciets,might have af
folded
But, sir, the fact is now disclosed, «md the question is, will
Congie«s sustain then committees m their honest efforts to re-
foi m abuses1 I have been told it will not Some old members
say they have seen enough to satisfy them that Congiess will
do nothing They say that it will be as in times past, loud re
foi m speeches will he made, and there it will end This is de*
spamng toosoon Congiess will come to the rescue, and, if
they do not, the people wilt The majesty of the power that
cieated this Government will reform us abu es whenevei
lightly informed as to whit ibust s do exist
¡sir, tne time has now come to test who are for and who
against reform Piofessions have had their day, practice must
now come ElTortb will be made to avoi 1 these questions A
diiect vote by yeas and nays enteied on the journal is a hateful
thing it may s¡ eak heieaftei Effoits will therefore be made
to evade this—to move amendments, to divert the question, to
lay on the table, or by some pailiamentary tnckto avoid a di-
rect vote 1 his, I say will be attempted by those who wish to
li each and not practise But those who desire m good faith
to practice will pursue a diferent ceurse They will seek a di-
