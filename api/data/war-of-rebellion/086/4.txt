HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,New Orleans, October 16, 1864.

Colonel E. W. HOLMSTEDT,

Commanding at Ship Island:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs me to say to you that if Lieutenant-Colonel Smith gave you any indications that an expedition was to be sent to the mainland to destroy the salt-works, that such an expedition has been abandoned by order of General Canby. You are informed of this fact for fear you might think it proper to send over an expedition yourself from Ship Island. General Canby prohibits any expedition to the shore opposite Ship Island for the present.

I am, sir, respectfully,

FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have received notice of important dispatches in relation to the operations in this command, in connection with Sherman's operations. I will wait until the steamer arrives. In the meantime, in whatever way it may be necessary, you are authorized to give your orders in my name for supplies or for troops that are not already under your orders.
