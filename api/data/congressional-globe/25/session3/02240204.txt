BOUNDARY Or M VINE                        |
Mr WILLIAMS, of Maine, rose and asked
the indulgence of lh<  St n ate to mike some ie   i
marks upon an aitiele in a leading jotuiul oí tin's |
city, (the National Intelligencer,) published tins
morning, in which the lecent piocccelmgs of the
State of  Maine  and of the people  of that State
weie represented in a light not only unjust, but
injurious     The stiugglc in which Mam    is now
engaged to maintain and  defend hti lights and I
the rights of the nation, is one of the dt tp st in
terest and concern to both, and to find a le itling
and influential journal at the seat of Government
coming out and condemning the course pursued i
by Maine in a controvcisy with a foiiign nation
was not only a íepioach upon his State, but cal   '
culated to piejudiee the public mind upon a ques
tion of the first importance to the State and na
tion
The editorial article referred to is calculati d to
impress upon thi nation that the people and the i
Legislatuie of Maine have been huriied into" vny \
hasty measwa," that " the boundaiy question is
not so much a question of leal substantial mtei
est as it is of State feeling, stimul ttctl by the n
valry between the two great patties m the State ¡
which shall tuin it most to Us advautngt  '   that
" the boundaiy question is a game which is ex
peeted to be won by the sitl   whit h sutcteds in
dining the ball finthest " that " tin boi   inorof
Maine gets the L gislituit   to authoii/e him to
send out a body of men totluvt thi J'utish sub   ¡
jtcts off fiom the land whit h tin itlintain claims
and actually oteupn s, and whieli is claimed also |
as teintoiy of the United States " and " the first |
thatCongiess hcais oí them is, that tlie Govt, mor
of Maine is ictually levying war against a Power I
in amity with the United btates "                            |
Maine is now f>tiugghng,antl pcihnps bleeding,
in defence of her rights, invadid and thit att ncei |
by a foreign Powei, and to see her Government
and people thus unjustly and lnjuiiously ti atod, I
IS too much fni any of herrcjiresenUttivt s to stiftci
to pass unnoticed and unirhukcd     Ifehulnoth   ,
ing to say of the motues which could have  in
duced the publication, hi  business was to expose '
to the Senate and to the natnn the gieat injustice i
done by this publication to his State and to the
government of it, and with this view he dtsued  I
to place befoie the Senate the facts which had led  I
to the present alarming and nitert sting state of
affairs     As to the right of the United States and   .
Mame to the territory in dispute between this   '
country and Great Britain, he would   not  ¡siy
more than to refer to the unanimous deel iration of
both Houses of Congress at the last session    o,s
to the question of jurisdiction, it might be im
portant to spread before the Senate the facts in
the case, which he would do as briefly as possi
ble     Prior to 1820, Mame was pait of Massa
chusetts, and the seat of government was at Bos-
ton, four or five hundred miles from the temtory
now in dispute     But little was then known of
the Madawaska or the Aroostook, they lay far
beyond tku settled part of the Commonwealth, and
with tne exeeption of the Madawaska settlement,
were  wilderness   and  uninhabited    Whatever
communication tnere was, and could be, between
the settled part of Massachusetts and Mada-
waska, was through the British Provinces and up
the St  Johns uver
The rnmmissioneis under the treaty of Ghent
had been expected to settle and determine the
treaty line, until about the time Maine was sep
aiated fiom Massachusetts, and until their dis
agreement was  made  public, no one hid any
apprehension tint Gtcat Bntam would pretend
that the highlands of the treaty weie to be found
at Mar's Hill    In 1820 Mime became a separate
State, owning one half of the unsold lands, and
Massachusetts the othei  half   and in  1821  oi
18-23, in agent of the State of Maine was sent
into the Madawaska and Atoostook countries to
ascertain their condition, to look after the timbei,
and to piosecute tiespasseis    This was effected,
and satisfiction obtained  for  the timber which
had been cut     The same course was pursued the
following jeai, and  neailv,if not quite, every
year from th it tim    to this     In 182o, the land
igcnts of Massachusetts and   Maine weie em

In consequence of the«c difficulties,and to avoid
the t vils of ac mtliit of jurisdiction, an mfoimal,
and somt what mdt finin , undei standing was had
bttween the Govt nmients of the United States
and Great Ihitam, th it pending the ntgotiation
and aibitration as to tht line of bound \iy 1 ctwten

to st length t n its claim to thejircjudice of the other
putj While it is admitted th it the British Gov
ernnit nt might well cl um jurisdiction over the
caily st tiled put of Madawaska, it can scarcely
be pretended that sueh clum would include the
Amencin settlers fuithei up the St Johns, who
settled there about the yeai 1816, but however
that mav be, there can be no just pn tenst that the
Iiiitish Governmtnt ovo bad junsdiction in the
Aroostook ctmntiy And as iclates to recent
events m Maine, it is impoitant to ket ¡i in mind
that the facts, so fat asi date to the question ofjiuis
diction, aie veiy different in the Aroostook coun
tiy from wh it th y art in the M idawaska coun
try In the htt i, there were earl) settlements
and grants fiom the Ciown In the foimer, the
first settlements weienot cailier than 1822, made
by Ami ritan citizens and persons fi im the Piov
mees, who resorted there to be within Jtmeilean
tetiitoiy, and beyond the reach of their Piovincial
ereditois Very soon after the establishmt nt of
the monument at the smice of the St Croix, a
line was run due north theicfiom, and two ranges
of townships, each of six miles squate,weie sur
voyed and locate d by the Commonwealth of Mas
sachusotts, contiguous to that line, and extending
northwaidly many miles beyond the Aioostook
river The township including the Aioostook
liver and adjoining to the due north line, was
conveyed by Massachusetts as early as 1807, and
other townships and parts of townships were con
veyed soon after, all of which have been, and are,
held by those giantces and their assigns
In 1826, the terntoiy west of these two ranges
of townships, and extending near to St Johns
river, was surveyed under the joint authority of
Massachusetts and Maine, into townships of six
miles square, and soon after divided between those
States Many of these townships have been sold
to mdivieluils, and the others remain the prop
erty of the State A road has been marked out
fiom the military road, near Mattawamkeag,
acioss the Aioostook, and thence on to the St
Johns, and is well made to the Aroostook river
j     The land agents of Maine and Massachusetts
I have frequently, and almost year'y, been upon
that temtory, sold timbei,gianted permits, pios
eeuted trespassers, and exeicised other acts of
owneiship The peisons settled upon that nvei
look to Massachuoctts and Maine for titles to the
land they possess, and it is not known that the
British authonties ever made, or pioposed to
mike, grants to any of them In fact, the only
claim to judiseliction by the Butish authorities,
so f u as known, depends upon then assumption
that, as the land once belonged to the Ciown,
| and has not been set apait, the title of jurisdic-
tion lemams now in the Ciown, that by the ar-
| rmgement before mentioned, they retain juris-
diction until tin controversy about the boundaiy
sh ill be settled and that they have a warden to
look after tiespasseis upon the disputed terntoiy,
foi the benefit of the party to whom the land may
I finvllybe awatded The chum to exclusive juris-
diction is of veiy recent origin, and without a
shadow of foundation Whenever advanced, it
has been dt nit d byoui Government, and in 1829
we find the Acting Lieutenant Goveinoi of New
I Liunswiek, in a lettei to the Butish Minister,
us s this 1 inguage
I am ti tluced t > submit to jour Excellency s consider

I d ition    and tilt  ntriction of the existing understanding
be tween the two Govt rnments  uitilth   pending question
bt tween tile tvv ) Governments sli ill be decided  '
And now, the claim is to the exclusive juris-
diction
Let us now look at the causes which have
biought on the alaiirnng state of things which
thieatens the peace of the country, and see
whether or not the government and people of
Maine aie justly chargeable with "very hasty
measmes "
Duuog the last year, the land agent of Mame
went twice upon the territory on and about the
Aioostook wateis, saw the persons who had pre
pned ti cut timbt t, warned them to desist, and,
in some cases, sued theptrsons concerned, and
obtained satisfaction for what they had cut, and,
in all instances, the tiespasseis piomised to quit.
leaiing that, after he should be gone, the ties-
l passeis might return to their woik of destruction,
I lie notified them that, if they should do so, he
J should piosecute them and take their teams     In
I December, the line! agents sent Mi   Buckmore
to the Aroostook and Pish rivers, to prevent, as
far as he could, any trespassing upon the public
lands
In January, that agent íeported to the Governor
of Maine that vast dt jnedations were committed
by some two oi three hundred peisons, who not
only refused to de sist, but defied the powerof the
State to pieventtheii cutting timber to any extent
| they pleased    The Governor communicated that
I information to the Legislature then in session
, The Ltgisiatuie   thereupon  " directed the  land
agent foithwith to employ sufficient foice to ar-
I rest, detain, and impiison all persons trespassing
upon the terntoiy of the State, and to dispose of
j the  teams,  lumber, and other materials  of the
j tiespasseis, as he should deem  necessary  and
I expedient "   Under this resolve, the land agent
proceeded with about two hundred chosen men
to the scene of operations on the Aroostook, dis-
persed most of the trespasser, and arrested some
fifteen or twenty    On the following night, while
the land agent was in bed, he was surrounded by
aimed men, and  oideied to  Fredenckton     On
his inquiring then authonty, they presented bay-
onets, and compelled him to go with them to
Woodstock, where there was some examination
by magistrates, and then oidered to Fredenckton
under military guard, in a most humiliating man-
ner   What is his present condition is not known
Upon this, Sir John Harvey, Lieutenant Gov-
ernor of New Biunswick, issued his proclama-
tion, reciting that he had received information
I that a party of armed persons, two hundied or
more, had invaded that province from the neigh-
| boung State of Maine, for the professed object
I of exercising authority, and driving off persons
