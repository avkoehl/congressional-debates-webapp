78                                       THtí CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.____________December 31,
his protest against the few obseivations he had
made, as he happened not to be m his place at
the time He regietted that such was  the case,
it was the Senator's duty to be in his place at the
time, as he moved the íesolution, and made the
ehaige contained in his speech When this re
poit came in, he (Mr N ) moved the printing of
an extia number of copies, as well on the ground
that it was but an act of justice due to the officer
implicated, to the Senate, and to the country, that
these documents should be sent out as an answei,
not only to the Senator's resolution, but to his
speech The Senator says that in the light in
which he views this document, it forms no justi-
fication for the acts of the Secietary Now, if
this was true, he ought not to object to the encu
lation and distribution of those documents But,
from the Senator's íemarks, he was inclined to
think that he was not much disposed to exculpate
the Secretary                                                                 i
Mr N said he could not conceive what the ,
honorable Senator had to complain of, or what I
had called for his extraordinary course of pro-
ceeding     The document went to the publie, ac-
companied by his lemaiks, which were in icply
to those made by the Senatoi when he intioduced I
his resolution      Still they weie not in the same
charaetei with the remaiks made by the Senatoi,
they weie not made in advance of the tvid* nee,
like  those of the Senatoi     The Sen itoi   isked
who it was that sit the example'    Why it wis
the Senatoi himself, who pufaced a meie resolu   .
tion of mquiiy with lenmks highly condemna   I
toiy of a public officei     Now, if his umaiks
weie not sustained by the documents, and it was
not foi him to say whethei they were 01 not, yet
his course of jmx ceding was not to be rompan d
with that of the honorable Senatoi      The gentle-
man instituted a eeitain course of inquinen, and
without waiting to get th<   fects h(   sought foi,
accoidmg to all the established íules of puha-
mentary piocetding,and all the puncinlesof jus-
tice, he accompanies that niquuy with a spiceh
occupying two hours of the time of the Si natt,
the whole of which weie imputations of the ti nth
of the faotsyettobeasicitaim d   11 heundi i stood
the sum and substanci of it, it Wi nt to chaigo I
that the Secietary of the Treisuiy had levived [
and lcstoud the deposit system, by a conni etion
with the Bank of tin Unitid Stati s and othus,
without any legxl legulations, fu the puiposi of
being leheved fiom all legal ustiaiiits m the use I
of the banks   and tint all tin pinfi v-mns on the .
pait of the Admimsti ition of hostility to a ion
ncction with banks win hypothetn il and decep-
tive, that then was no disposition on tin part of i
the  Secntny t >  gi I along without the aid of
banks     Hi it was the gist of th   whole speti h
Now, if tin  icpoit sustained all this, his [Mi
ft 'bj  sputh would go befoie the woild  tuum-
ph tntly     Hut the public would look at the wholt
matter with rcgnid to the facts, and not with re-
gard to tht oolonng given to them by the gentle
man fiom Viigimi                                                       I

Mi Y observed that this resolution was the
■won in subst mee as the one submitted by him at
the last session, and which had not yet been an-
swi led by the Secretary lie now submitted it '
again for the pureosc of recalling the subject to
tin Secietaiy's attention That gieat injustice
had been done to many individuals,and to some
pa ticdlaily in his own State, by lepoitmg them
is dct-uiltfrs when they were entitled to credits,
he hau befoie nad occasion to state It might be
that voucheis were produced by those persons
who iiad been icpoued as defaulters, which, not
being deemed formal by the Department, weie
not placed to their ciedu, and consequently they
appealed simply as defaulters m the documents,
without there being any íeference to the o edits
which they claimed Great injustice was thus
done to these individuals, by not stating the fact ¡
that there weie items of eiedit claimed by them
which were not allowed He could point out men
of piopeity, and of the highest standing in his
State, who thus appealed as defaulters, while they
owed little or nothing to the Government He
knew an instance in which a person, since dead,
had been reported as a defaulter for $75,000, and
he knew that there was a leceipt in the Treasury
for $25,000 of this money, which on account of
some informality, was not passed to his credit,
while thete was also a bank deposit of $18,000
not credited for the same reasons There weie
othei payments, also, in this case, winch brought
theciedits ncaily up to $50,000, whilst the default
appeared in the documents to be $75,000
Now he knew that if the ci edits claimed by
these persons weie repoi ted at the same time with
the chaiges against them, a great many who now
seemed to be dcfiulteis, would not appear in the
íeports as defaulter at all We all know (said
Mi Y ) the eifect that it has upon the eiedit and
character of a mm to publish him as a defaulter
to tin Government, and the gteat injustice that
was done theicby Peihaps the Secietary had
piep ued a statement in obi dience to trie resolu-
tion of the last session If this was the case, the
piesent resolution, wl n h was diawn up piecisely
as the one of tin last session, would serve to call
his attention to it, and to include defaulteis who
had subsequently become so
Mi HUBBARD observed that the Senator was
mistaken in supposing that the Secietary had not
íespondcd to the call on the subject at the last
session There was a statement, and a veiy full
one, embiacing eveiy paiticulai calk d for by the
Sinatoi, sent in at the last session, and it must
have i scaped the Senitoi's notice He had no
objt ction, howi ver, to the pu sent íesolution, as
it would pioduce a statement with leg id to sub-
sequent di fuilts
Mi \OUNGappi i hended that the Senator was
mistaken The statement to which he had refer
i nee wis mide in answei to another call, and
did not lontam the infoimation that he particu-
larly wtnted
SALT DUTY.
Mr MORRIS moved to rescind the oidei mide
on L'nday last foi punting certain documents in
lelation to the salt duty
Mr  M   said he would state Ins reasons briefly
fm ofieiing the itsolutionlo risuiid     lie object-
ed to the ordei to punt, bciause it wis an oider
to punta  document oí the  Butish  Paihamcnt
Hi did not know wliu ellect might be produced
by thi dissemination of this book—it might be   I
apolitical  one—but he  thought it quite enough   i
foi   us  to  punt the official   documents  of   this   ]
Govenimi nt     If the work v af> of si ch vast util-
ity, of such   genetal interest, there  were many
bookselkis in this country who would be glad of
an  oppoitumty to publish  it     lie greatly pie-
fnied to leave this matter to private enterpuse    |
lie ventuicd the opinion that if this book was
punted foi the use of the Senate, not one fourth
of the members will open the leaves of it     He
was ojipostd to the duty on silt—everyman was
opposed to it     Ho thought there was no need of
niiormation on  this subject     But  suppose we
punt tlmty thousand copies of this docu nent
they become, ipso jacto, out pioperty, we can do
what we pleast with them      Suppose, when we
jo home, i ach of us would tell oui  people, we   ,
tax you tin ty thousand dolíais to pay foi punt
nig these books, each of you must pay your
tn  ti, and when printed, we take them to our-  t
sthes, and give them to whom we please     The
question lesolves itself into this  shall the people
—the \\ hole people—be taxed to enable us to dis-
tubute books among oui fuends and acquaint-
ances     He thought the punting was a useless
waste of the public money, and hoped the Clerk
would be directed not to proceed with it until  |
fell the i f ideied by the Senate                                   I
Mr BENTON observed that this motion to I
punt the papéis relative to the salt duties, was an I
unfortunate one It was made a ftw yeais ago, I
when the high tanff party was predominant on 'I
that floor It was carried, but the next day the
order was rescinded, as it was proposed to do
now He did not then think it strange, because
the high tauff party had the ascendency The
Senator fiom Rhode Island, who was then in lus
place, [Mi Robbins,] was the member who made
the motion to íescind When ñe introduced this
motion a few days ago, he very distinctly stated
his object, and called the particular attention of
the Senate to it, and so far he had engaged the
attention of the members of the body, that all
voted with a full knowledge of what the document
was. The Senator fiom Ohio was not present
when the motion was made, but he availed him-
self of the first opportunity to show his objections
to it His objections were, first, because the papei
to be printed was a foieigi papei Now the very
first thing that this Government ever oideied to
be punted was apaicel of foreign papéis, íclative
to the fisheries of E-naland, France, and Holland,
and he believed that from that time to this foieign
papers had been printed as often as isked for
The Senatoi fiom Ohio feared the ntioduction
of foieign politics Now there ceitainly was no
politics, either foreign or domestic, so that objec-
tion had no force The Senator also objected to
the punting of books Now this happened to be
no book at all ¡t was a document that he had
two objects in wishing to print One was to dis-
seminate among the people information valuable
to them, and the other was that it might be used
on that rlooi m supoort of a bill to abolish the
salt tax These papéis were deemed so valuable
by the British Parliament, that they oideied them
to be printed, and the effect of this publication
was, that the salt tax:, which had stooJ foi one
bundled and fifty years,fell, though the Chancel-
lor of the Exchequer stated in his place that the
Treisuiy could not do without the one and a half
millions which the salt tax produced Such was;
the effect of spieading befoie the country the val-
uable nifoim ition contained in these papers, that
the umveisal consent was that the salt tax must
go on something else, and the tax on that indis-
pensable article was left without a defender The
infoimation collected on this subject, gatheied
fiom a vast numbei of individuals, commencing
with men of the greatest eminence, and going
down to the humble individual who with his own
hands tended lus cow or his sheep, exhib'ted a
pei feet union between the íesults of science and
experience, and conclusively demonstiating that
the country suffeied many ten times over by the
tax beyond the amount pioduced by it to the
Government So much with respect to the pub-
lication of the papéis and the existence of the
tax
With respect to the effect on agncultuie and all
its inteiests, (including the gieatest of its inteiests,
that of stock laismg,) the íepeal of this tax had
done more to impiove and increase the stock in
Endand than anything that had evei been done
foi that great branch of national wealth Evciy-
body knew that the stock of England was in the
highest state of [perfection, and that we weie daily
impoiting the finest specimens of it It was m
vain (Mr B said) for us to import these fine
specimens without also impoiting along with it
the knowledge necessary to sustain it One sin-
gle fact shown m these documents will give an
idea of then impoitance lor instance, it was
shown that there weie thirty millions of sheep in
the kingdom, and that to each sheep was gi\en
a half bushel of salt, making fifteen million bush-
els gnen to the sheep—given foi the purpose
of impioving its health, its flesh, and us wool,
and as a secuuty and defense against the many
diseases to which the animal was liable The
same document (continued Ml B ) went on to
show the quantity of salt given to all othei kinds
of stock, both milk cattle and working cattle, as
well as those fattening foi the market, together
with the quantity us d in pieseivmg, nnpiovmg,
and restoring the various kinds of food w ith which
stock is sustained, all of which was ascertained
by actual experiment In short, take the whole
papei, and it would be found to he one of the
most valuable from the amount of intellect, com-
bining science with experiment, that was com-
puted m it It was also a peifect specimen of
the manner of conducting accurate investigations
by a committee of a legislative body The effect
of publishing these papers in England, as he said
befoie, was to abolish the salt tax theie    It would
