Washington, September 18, 1862.

Major-General WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

If possible, send some troops by rail to Hagerstown to join General McClellan. In the present condition of affairs, it is believed that some regiments may be spared from railroad guards. This must be left to your judgment. Any new regiments arriving at Baltimore can be sent immediately to Hagerstown. Take possession of the railroad, if necessary.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

BALTIMORE, MD.,

September 18, 1862 - 11.35 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I sent this morning about 1,700 Maryland troops, under command of General Kenly, via Harrisburg, to Hagerstown, to report to Major-General McClellan. I have ordered the Sixth Maryland, 600 strong, and four pieces of artillery, with horses, to proceed as above this evening. These are all that I can spare from here. I ordered one regiment from the Northern Central Railroad.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

P. S. - Your dispatch of 10.30 a. m. is received. I mentioned in my dispatch last evening that two regiments were at the Patuxent, subject to General Banks' orders. Cannot they be spared? I will be compelled to send some troops with the prisoners marching on foot to Annapolis. This is required on account of the depredations they commit wherever they go.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Major-General WOOL, Baltimore, Md.:

The two regiments at the Patuxent are subject to your orders. General Banks thinks that one can be spared.
