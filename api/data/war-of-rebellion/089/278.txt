fire on the new work in front of Fort McGilvery. I think they will continue it, more or less rapidly, until we stop, even if we double our present armament.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 19, 1864-7.20 p. m. (Received 7.30 p. m.)

Colonel ABBOT:

General Butler desires that you send to Cox's Hill to-morrow six 30-pounder Parrott guns. If you are unable to send 30-pounders send 20-pounders. They are to be used against the rebel gun-boats in the river early on the morning of the 21st. Please answer. A detachment enough to be sent to work the guns in case Captain Pierce has not enough men.

PETER S. MICHIE,

Lieutenant, U. S. Engineers.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 19, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Lieutenant MICHIE,

Chief Engineer, Headquarters Army of the James:

How would it do to use Ashby's battery of four 20-pounder Parrott's and the three 4 1/2-inch guns in Fort Brady? If it is for a temporary use I would decidedly advise this, as the pontoon brigade is so weak that it will be necessary to carry the guns by a barge and the labor would be unnecessary. If the guns are to be kept in position I can, of course, send them. Ashby's battery is with the Eighteenth Corps, and if not with its corps can easily cross the brigade. Please answer to-night.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 19, 1864-8.55 p. m.

A. PIPER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

October 19, 1864-8.50 p. m.

Colonel ABBOT:

General Butler wishes to use the guns in all; three in the new battery, four in another that I will build to-morrow, and three from the fort. Ashby's battery is on Bermuda front. They will of if some one will haul them over. What is wanted are guns and men to man them.

MICHIE,

Lieutenant.
