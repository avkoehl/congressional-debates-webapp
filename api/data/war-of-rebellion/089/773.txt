Captain WILLIAM MCALLISTER,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, First Brigadier, First Div., Second Corps:

CAPTAIN: In answer to your communication of this date, I have the honor to state that yesterday, while examining the ground in my front at about 4 p. m., I saw from the picket-line at the right of house (in my front) a column of rebel infantry marching to the west. I saw perhaps a brigade pass. The pickets at this post told me that the enemy's troops had been moving past this point for an hour. The pickets also told me that the enemy had left their camp on this front, striking tents that morning.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. SCOTT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment.
