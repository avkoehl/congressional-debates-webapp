THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1847
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I appeal to the honorable
Senator from New Hampshire, as a matter of per-
sonal favor to myself, to yield me the floor to en-
able me to call up Seriate joint resolution JNo. 8.
It is a resolution which was postponed this morn-
it^g m consequence of my having the floor on
another matter, and it is a resolution m which my
State is interested. 1 do not suppose there will
be any discussion about it. The honorable Sen-
ator from Indiana [Mr. Hendricks] called it up
this morning, and my colleague desires to call it
up now. ft will take but a few moments.
Mr. HALE. 1 have been tryingforafortmght
to <;et up the joint resolution which I have named.
I do not think it will take a minute's time. If
the Senate will listen to a very short report ac-
companying it, I do not think there will be any
discussion about it.
The motion of Mr. Hale was agreed to; and
the joint resolution (S. No. 41) for the lelief of ...
Garrett R. Barry, a paymaster m the United jj then-* was no just chum on the paitof the State
company in fuil payment and situ taction of aii claims of
said company against the State of Wisconsin and of ti*o
United States. on account of mid canal laud r>, « n
account of am action of tlw Tenitorv orSt.uo of \Wcon-
sm. or of the U-nted Siai<\s in nd.itiou iheieto.
J?EC. 2. vSuit be ii taituct rc\olvuif Thai tin: ConuiiN
sjonor of tin* Geneiai j.i'iid Office hi', mid he !< h"ichy, ap-
pointed eommissionei to adjust the accounts herein pro
vided fot, under the Mipei vision of the Secrefaiy of Hie
Inteiioi, i\yd to determine what f-utn shall boehaigtd to
said State oi Wisconsin foi the lands guinted loi the eon
stiuction ot said canal; and what s-iuns fliail he credited
rc&ppcuvely to said State and said company foi the money •>
expended by ihem in the construction of &aid locks and
canal heiem provided.
Mr. FESS&NDEN, I should like to inquire
of the Senator from Wisconsin whether this is
the same matter that \wis at one time before the
Committor on Finance.
Mr. HOWE. Yes, sir.
Mr. FKSSENDiiN. Then \ ceuaiolyam op-
posed to its passing in the present condition ot
things, for at thai time I became satisfied that
States Navy, was lead a second time, and con
sidered as jn Committee of the Whole. It pro-
poses to release Paymaster Garrett R. Hurry,
united States Navy, from his liability as surety
of John De Bice, formerly paymaster m the Navy
of the United States.
Mr. HALE. All the facts ore stated in the
leport accompanying the resolution, which can
be read it any Senator desires it.
The joint icsolution was reported to the Senate
without amendment, ordered to be engrossed for
a third reading, read the third time, and parsed.
CHAItU;? If. ANDERSON.
Mr. FOOT. I ask for the consideration of a
private bill. It is the bill (S. No. 20?) for the
relief of Charles F. Anduson.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill was
read a second time, and considered as in Com-
mittee of the Whole. It directs the Secretary of
the TVasury to pay Charles F. Andeison, archi-
tect, the sum of §7,500 in full, for time, labor,
and expense, in ntepuiiiig plans and drawings*
for the Capitol extension.
Mr. FOOT. The bill has the unanimous ap-
proval of the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, to whom it was referred, and who have
examined the subject.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, lead the third time, and passed.
CLAIMS OI' WISCONSIN.
Mr. IiOWE. I move that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of the joint resolution (S.
No. 8) for the relief of the State of Wisconsin.
The motion was n&e-ed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee m"the Whole, proceeded to consider
the joint resolution.
Mr.HOWE. The Committee on Public L^nds
have repoited the resolution with an amendment
in the nature of a suhrxtnuU . 1 propose, if there
be no objeenon, that ih" .nn< ndment only be read.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That course
will be taken, if theie be no objection.
The Secretary lead the ann ndment, to strike
out all of the joint resolution after the resolving
clause and insert:

of Wisconsin. Xiow it was withdrawn from the
| supervision of that committee to winch it was
first sent and went to the Committee on Claims,
j and how they have come to a fuvoiable conclu-
sion, I do not know; but at. that time I certainly
! oeeame mtv well satisfied that the claim did not
I really exist.' 1 should hke to have an explanation
i of it. Is then: any printed report accompany-
I ins;  tr
| Mr. HOWE. Yes, sir.
| Mr. FESSEXJJEjN. i should like to heartliat
! repot t read
' «Mr. HENDRICKS. The report is quite an
| elaboi.ue <u.e, which I felt it my duty to piesent
] to the iSenn'e.
j Mr. FESSENDEN. Then 1 should prefer the
j resolution to go over, if it is a printed report and an
! elaborate out . The Senate is not fuil now; there
i is mi quoiuii) he i e or any tiling like it, and it would
be improper to pass a resolution ot this kind,
taking so much money out of theTr'-asury, in the
present condnion of the Senate. If the resolution
can £o over, 1 will take a copy of the report home
with me, read it, and refresh my lecollection with
regard to it. 1 am very unwilling that it should
be'ac&'d upon in such a thin bVnate.
Mi. HENDRICKS. So far as I am concerned
I shall abide hy the pleasure of the Senate in that
respect.
Mi. GRIMES. There are not a dozen Sen-
atois h"ie, and we may as well adjourn. This
matter should be discussed in a full Senate.
Mr. HOWE. If >t is to he discussed 
Mr. GRIMES. JI wiil be, you know.
Mr. IiOWE. I simply want to make an ex-
planation in answer to the mquuyof the Sena-
tor from Maine ay to how tins ciatm happened
to be taken from the Committee on Finance and
referred to the Committee*on Ciuims. When i
had the honor to mtioducca icsolution for tiie
settlement of this claim on the part of the State
of Wisconsin, which chum ir- based upon a pub-
lic statute unrepealed, I understood th;«t the only
objection to the payment of H was that the Gov-
ernment claimed a liability on the pait ot the
State to pay it, the Go\ominem, for .'be whole
value of the lands made bv the construction of
the Hock river canal, Mid that that chum was
bas>al upon aa amendment to the law which ad-
mitted the .State of Wisconsin into (he Unum.
j thought I had disco w red luiiclusive pioof that
that amendment was nicorrect; that it never w. s
adopted by the two Houses ot Congre:-^. I yath-
ert-d that id'Miee from the Congressional Globe.
I I supposed ! could satisfy the commuter and nui-
' isfy the Senate lua! tlie statute as punished m
! the edition of laws was mcoi r^ct, and^ thai it was
| coi rect as it was established in ihc Giobe, and it
j 1 could establish tiiat fact there would be no sort
i of objection to its being; acted upon by the Com-
i miitee on Firaru'e, theie bein^ noi.«m« but an
j ap[>rorniv'ie);i it> make, and that tout was toe ap
pi opnate cotUHUtcL tos''iid it to. It we s sent to
that ecmimiitee, and m the oooise ot the investi-
gation befoie that committee I became satisfo i*.
as did the chairman of that committee, that the
Globe was n.eoiitei,and that the statute as pub-
lished in our eduion rf iho laws wes c. rr .et.
That put it on the looting ol a private eUim,Rod
theisjtipoj; I ai orice pioj or-etl lo in ve n reptn n d
b'.ck and nde<ud lo the Committee on Claim*.
Mi. FES iEJNTDEN. I am not impufin- any-
thing to my friend for doing* so. My inquiry
was with a view &imply to ascertain whether it
was ihe same claim.
Mr. HOWE. Yes, sir. it has been before
ihe Committeeon Claims,and was reported unan-
imously by that committee at the Inst session of
Congiess, and has lecently been unanimously
reported again from that committee. As i. said
before, it rests upon a public statute. We. have
lam out of the money for a great while. If Sena-
tors desire the resolution to go over until io-mor-
row morning, of course I shall not object to it;
and I wiil ^ive way for a motion to adjourn.
Mr. GRIMES. I move that the Senate do.now
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Seriate
adjourned.
