consultation your committee, being unanimously of
opinion that the questions which he had refused to

honor, and stated that by his " professional honor "
he meant that whenever he received any item of
news, unless he had the permi&sionot the gentleman
or person who furnished it to him, he considered it
an honorable thing that he should not divulge the
source of such news, and gave no other reason tor
his refusal. Said witness White also testified that

not to divulge the source from which he obtained
the treaty.

In further performance of their duties your com-
mittee, at ttie tune and place aforesaid, proceeded

had been duly t-uimnoned as a witness, and who then
and there appeared and submitted himself to be
examined as a witness before said committee; and
alter being duly sworn by the chairman ot said com-
mittee the said Ramsdell testified that he was on
n&Mst/int of the said White as correspond nt of the
s-nd Tribune. He al&o testified, on lookiuir at a
copy ot the suid Tribune ol May 11,1871, that it con-
tained what purported to be a copy ot a recent treaty
between the United State? and (iieat Britain ; that
it was transmitted fioin Washington to the paper
for publication by said Wuite; that the copy which
was furuislied to be telegraphed as aforesaid was in
writing, which was copied fiom print, lie was then
nt-ked this question; "Who hud the printed copy
horn whn-h this manuscript was copied?" which
question the witness reiused to answer.
lie stated that bo first saw the printed copy in the
Tribune ofhee in Washington after nine o'clock in
the evening of May 10. lie was tiien asked this
question: *' In whose possession did you fiistseeit?"
which he also refused to answer, not upon tho
ground that he was unable to answer it, but because
he was " in duly bound as a man of honor not to
an>.vver it." _
He was then asked this question : Do you know
from whom that printed copy was obtained ?" which
question he also refused to answer.
He was then asked this question: "Do you know
what was paid for it?" which he also refused to
answer! and he also stated that as to all the ques-
tions which he had declined to answer, he declined
not upon the ground thathecould uotauswer.
Ttie witness was then dnceted to retire, and your
committee, on a consultation, being uuammously of
opinion that the questions which the witness had
refused to answer were proper and that he was
bound to answer them, the witness was recalled
and informed by the chairman that such was the
opinion of the committee, and informed that his
refusal to answer to said questions might subject
him to proceedings for contempt.
The chairman then said to the witness: Having
made this explanation, I now ask you, as I did
bclore, from whom tho printed copy of what pur-
ports to be the treaty of which you have spoken
was obtained?" This question he also refused to
answer. He also stated that ho came to the exam-
ination wit h a fixed purpose not to answer any ques-
tion that should draw l'tom him tne source irom
winch that copy ot the treaty was obtained; and
that he then, ot his own judgment, understanding
the full circumstances of the case, persisted m his
rclusal to answer said question.

tion and answer, both before and after lie was re-
called, is hereto attached and marked * iiixhibit
No. 2."
Thcsubpena by which said witnesses were com-
manded to appearand testify before said committee
at the time and place aforesaid, together with the
certificate of service thereof, is hereto attached and
marked " Exhibit No. 3."
In the opinion of your committee the questions
put to said witnesses respectively were proper ques-
tions, necessary to make the investigation ordered
by said resolution of the Senate, ami that each of
said_ witnesses is in contempt of tho Senate and
merits to be dealt with for his miseon luct; and ttiat
tho dignity of the Senate requires that the pretense
upon which the wi'iiesses based the refusal should
not. be recogmzed as valid.
# Your committee, therefore, recommend tho adop-
tion of the following resolutions, uamely :
ltesnlved< That Zeb. L. Wuite, a witness hereto-
fore duly summoned beioro a select committee of
the Senate, and being lawfully required to testify

obligation to answer. If you refuse to answer, I do
not know that the committee have anything further
to say to you at present.
Mr. Trumbull. I should like to ask Mr. White a
question. Ll'o the witness.] I wish to inquire of you
whether the copy which you iurnished came through
the Senate ?
A nswer. 1 have no means of knowing.
Mr. Trumbull. Perhaps if we knew at what time
in tbe evening you first had possession of it that
fact might enable us to determine how it was. The
Senate met at twelve o'clock noon, as you are aware,
on the day the treaty was communicated by you, the
lOlh. My object in asking the question is to ascer-
tain whether the copy that you had enme through
the Senate. You might not know yourself, but you
could tell us at what time you first had possession
of the copy which you communicated; how early ?
The Witness. Weli, I prefer not to answer that
question. I may, perhaps, tell you something from
which you can draw an inference. I never send dis-
patches to the Now York Tribune later than one
o'clock at night.
Qwstion, (by Mr. Trumbull.) I wish to ask you
distinctly whether you know that tho copy you sent
came through the Senate?
Answer. I do not know that it did.
Question. You do not know whether it did or did
not?
Answer. I do not know whether it did or did not.
Question. Was the copy that you saw a printed
copy? I do not ask about what you furnished; but
was it a printed or manuscript copy that you saw?
Answer. I prefer not to answer that.
By the Chairman:
Queation. You mean that you refuse to answer?
Ansxoer. Yes, sir; I do.
By Mr. Trumbull:
Question. Do you decline to state at what time
you liiht saw or first had possession of a copy of the
treaty ?
Answer. Well, sir, I will answer thatquestion. It
was not later than ten o'clock that night.
By the Chairman:
Question. Was it earlier than ten o'clock?
Answer. I think it was about ten o'clock.
Question. Of the evening ot the 10th of May ?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Mr. Trumbull, (to tho witness.) Now, Mr. White,
if you think proper to answer whether that was in
print or not it might relieve you. perhaps, from some
difficulty.
The Witness. It was in print.
Mr. Trumbull. In my opinion I may state the
Senate has no jurisdiction or right to inquire any-
thing about where you got the treaty unless it came
through the Senate. If it came through the Senate
we have a right to inquire into it, and 1 have a*ked
you the question you have just answered with aview
of determining that fact.
Mr. Sumnkr. There is one other question the
answer to which would probably fix Mr. Whires
position, though possibly his last answer does. As
he has now testified that the copy which he saw was
iu print, the question I would ask is, was it printed
on a tolio or an octavo page ?
Tne Witness. Perhaps I would not be able to state
that. If you will describe to me the d ffere- ce be-
tween a folio aud an octavo page, perhaps I may be
able to answer.
Mr. Sumner. An octavo page is the ordinary page
on which Senate reports are printed, and the folio
page is ot tooiscap size. [Exhibiting to witness a
Senate document.] This is our ordinary octavo
p.ige. Was the copy which you saw printed on pages
of that kind?
The Witness. It was'not such a page as that.
By Mr. Trumbull :
Question. Did you ever look over what is printed
in ihe Tribune now before you to see if that is what
you sent?
Answer. I could not identify it without a com"
parison.
Question. Have you ever compared it ?
A newer. I have not.
Question. Did yoa send all of what purported tobÂ©
the treaty?
Answr. X should judge that I did.
