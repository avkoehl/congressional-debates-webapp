HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Pulaski, December 31, 1864-8 p.m.

Major General JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Decatur:

(To be forwarded.)

Your telegram of the 30th has been received. I would like you to ascertain to a certainty, if possible, what route Hood has taken in his retreat, without incurring too great a risk on your part. Has the pontoon bridge been laid at Decatur? After you are assured of Hood's line of retreat your command can return to Decatur, and thence to Chattanooga.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Major-General THOMAS:

My cavalry left Leighton, thirteen miles west of this place, at 3 o'clock this a.m., in pursuit of General Hood's pontoon train, which left near La Grange yesterday morning, December 30, in the direction of Russellville. I have 2,500 infantry at Town Creek, nine miles west of this place. There is no enemy at Florence or Tuscumbia. The pontoon train is reported as having been ordered to Columbus, Miss.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTHERN ALABAMA,Huntsville, December 31, 1864

Major-General STEEDMAN:

GENERAL: The bridge over Paint Rock has been burnt by the enemy's cavalry, 600 strong. I am compelled to order a portion of the garrison of Decatur to that point of the road to protect the bridges of Flint and Hurricane Creeks. I would request that you send 400 men to Decatur to supply their places.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DALTON, December 31, 1864

[Captain H. A. FORD,]

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General District of the Etowah:

One of my scouts from Spring Place informs me that General Runnells, commanding Georgia State troops, has ordered them all to Murray County, with a view of capturing Dalton, and Cleveland. General Findley, C. S. Army, commanding in Lumpkin County, is to have immediate command, and is probably at Carter's plantation, on the Coosawattee, the general rendezvous. One regiment, 500 strong, is now encamped at Carter's.

J. B. CULVER,

Colonel Thirteenth Michigan, Commanding.
