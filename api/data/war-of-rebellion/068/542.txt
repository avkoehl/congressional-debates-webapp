HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-2 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to advise you that these headquarters will be found to-day upon the road leading from Piney Branch Church to Spotsylvania Court-House.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. E. PEASE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to General Sedgwick.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-3.05 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: I have halted General Gibbon's division at the junction of the Todd's Tavern and Spotsylvania road with the Piney Branch Church road. I do not wish you to use him except in case of the most urgent necessity, because I anticipate Hill or Ewell making his appearance at Todd's Tavern, which point it is necessary to hold, and the whole force is with you except Second Corps. I have directed the Artillery Brigade to be held in readiness at Piney Grove Church.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 8, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The result of General Crawford's demonstration was to show the enemy not intrenched there. He captured a number of prisoners, in all, to-day, some 50, perhaps. The enemy seem nervous and opened a stampeding fire after dark on our left. The enemy is cutting trees, and artillery is heard moving guns to his right.

Respectfully, yours,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 8, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

DEAR GENERAL: I have sent my statement of all that I know of importance instead of coming myself. I am rather amused at your conclusion from my remark about having any opinion to give, as indicating a loss of something, but in truth I only meant that there is but one thing left-to fight it out. I think it is very hard to do, but the object of war, a settlement, can never be come to without doing so. I am so sleepy I can hardly write intelligently.

G. K. WARREN.
