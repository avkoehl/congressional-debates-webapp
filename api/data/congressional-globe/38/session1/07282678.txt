ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS.
In the preparation of these calculations I have
taken unusual pains. 1 have been aided by a dis-
tinguished statist, Edmund Burke,ofNew Hamp-
shire, to whom the country is indebted for many
valuable lessons in economy. But if any one
questions the accuracy of the data upon which
they are based, I present some actual transactions
which confirm my conclusions. Below is the copy
of a document showing the actual duties and
charges paid at the Boston custom-house on a
package of woolen goods and silk India-rubber
fabrics imported from England and entered April
5, 1864. It is the account rendered to the import-
ers by the brokers who transacted the business at
the custom-house. The package was marked B
77, and contained goods invoiced in Liverpool at
il29 2s. 1 Od. In reducing the sterling currency to
Federal money, the invoice, for the sake ©f con-
venience, is called <£130.

§1,970 00
It will bo seen that the pound sterling is esti-
mated at $5 in American gold, which is higher
than the actual rate of exchange, thatbeing about
$4 83 to the pound; and therefore it is most favor-
able to the manufacturer.
Thus the packagc of goods which cost .£130,
or $650 in gold, (calling the pound sterling #5,) in
England, actually cost $1,970 in the paper cur-
rency of the United States, to import into this
country, reckoning the difference of exchange at
80 per cent, premium, as it was at the'datcof
the transaction. Add to the cost in this country,
„._,970, the profits of the importer of 10 per cent.,
or $197, and the cost to the purchaser in our mar-
ket is $2,167. At this point of their cost the
goods come in competitian with goods of the same
icind produced by the home manufacturer. Thu3
he receives A protection "or bounty on the same
amount of goods ($650) of $1,517, or 232 per
cent, ai valorem! ■ ' .
On the same operation, calculated on a specie
basis, the results will be as follows: cost in Liv-
erpool <£130=$650. Duties and charges ^90=
$450. Total cost in this country, $1,100. Add
$110 for the profits of the importer—whole sum
$1,210. Deduct first cost $650, and there re-
mains $460 bounty to thft home manufacturer on
the same amount of goods, or 86 per cent, ad va-
lorem ! This transaction shows that the actual
protection given to the manufacturers of woolen
and India-rubber goods by the tariff of 1862 ia
more than double the rates assumed in my calcu-
lation, under the heads of Woolen and India'
Rubber Manufactures, which were 35 and 40 per
cent, ad valorem. My demonstrations on that
basis are sufficiently startling, although they fall
far below the actual fact.
This single transaction demonstrates beyond
cavil the immense gains which the manufacturers
are making by means of a protective tariff and a
depreciated paper money system. Is it surprising
that they grow rich ? Will it be a matter of sur-
prise if the people should grow poor and poorer
under the operation of such a cunning system
of injustice and robbery? The bandit baron
who, in the middle ages, ravished his tribute
money with mailed hand from the innocent way-
fayer, or the navigator of the river which flowed
past his castle, practiced an honest system com-
pared to the shrewd schemes of the present tariff
system.
Again, if it still be thought that my calculations
are inaccurate, I furnish the House with another
actual transaction. Messrs. Parker, Gannett &
Osgood, large importersof seeds,&c., in Boston,
have furnished the following statement of the cost
of importing an invoice of seeds:
Cost of seeds in England £40, exchange $4 85....$194 00
Cost of bags and casks    24 92
Consul's fees,    83
War risk, with insurance    53 ™
Portage     —. 75
Duties, 30 per cent., gold  §67 50
Premium on gold     46 24
Permit  20
Bond  40
Stamps  ™
Pre'sln  Jll 136 59
Exchange on sterling £40  16121
8535 33
Thus it costs in the depreciated currency of this
country to import and land in Boston $535 33 on
an invoice of seeds costing only ^40 in England,
equal to $194 in the gold currency of the United
States. Add the importer's profits at 10 per cent.,
$53 53, in the whole #588 88, and we have the cost
m our marketatwholesale prices,"or205 percent,
advance on the first cost in England!
This transaction demonstrates that the profits
of the home manufacturer, as I have calculated
them, derived from the combined effects of a high
tariff and a depreciated paper currency, are very
far below the actual truth. Seeds do not come in
competition with the home producer. Manufac-
tured articles do compete with the home manu-
facturer, and on those descriptions of goods im-
poited, the duty is much higherthan 30percent.
The statement above shows that under the present
system the protection given to the home manu-
facturer cannot be less than 200 per cent., and in
most instances a great deal more. The tables
herein show that it is 148 to 150 per cent. But in
most instances they omit freight, insurance, and
other small charges. And they arc constructed
on the basis of paper depreciated in the. value of
only $160 for $100in gold.
Another fact is to be remarked in connection
with the statementabove. The importation was
a quantity of seeds for the benefit of the farmer
and gardener. They are taxed a duty of 30 per
