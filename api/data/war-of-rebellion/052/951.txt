HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tenn., September 30, 1863.

Major General G. GRANGER:

The general commanding directs you to send General Spears with his command immediately to the Sequatchie Valley above Therman, to protect our line of transportation. Instruct him to take a strong position, patrol the country above him, and give any aid to the work of forwarding supplies that may be needed. Should it be necessary he had better intrench himself.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL MORGAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

Near Stevenson, September 30, 1863.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

I send you copies of dispatches sent through last night by General Morgan to General Granger. Colonel Campbell sent no dispatch to you or myself notifying us of this important intelligence. I got the copies from General Morgan, having ridden down this morning from Bridgeport to see what condition things were in and to procure horses,&amp;c. I send this to you at once, 8.30 o'clock a.m., believing the General Mitchell ought to be the first to receive the information. A regiment started this morning at 3 o'clock for Guntersville, and as soon as the result of their reconnaissance is known, I will see that it is promptly forwarded to your headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant E. HOYT, Jr.,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: Inclosed please find a communication from the officer commanding the patrol on the river. The pickets at McGinnis' Ferry report having heard wagons ascending the mountain during the night. Only a very few straggling rebels have been seen across the river this morning. Two deserters report that if the enemy are crossing the river at all, they will probably cross at Guntersville. Breckinridge's (Ninth Kentucky) cavalry are supposed to be among the party. Guntersville is 28 miles below this point.

I am, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WICKLIFFE COOPER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
