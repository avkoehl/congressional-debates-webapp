agree that that would be m order** If the one was m
order, certainly the other would be He held this
amendment to be utterly contrary to the spirit of
all the rules of the House, and hoped the decision
of the Chair would be sustained If this amend-
ment was mnoduced, we would be kept here de-
bating this bill perhaps for months to come, while
the public service would be suffering for want of
the appnprntions contained m this bill He
trusted, therefore, that the amendment would be
rejected, and that the bill would be speodily passed

STED, REED, and CUSHMAN, the decision of
the Chair was affirmed—ayes 66, noes 57

in the session for a i eduction of the postage, when
the chairman [Mr Montgomery] «aid he presumed
the gentleman [Mr Reed] could get all the infor-
mation he desired by a call upon the Department
Upon that occasion, Mr R replied that he had
made repeated calls, meaning by resolutions etc
and in debate, and referring to the boxes and the
reduction of the postage, but did not refer to any
ioimal call upon the Department, nor did he refer
at that time at all, to the expense of advertising

The bill for the relief of Michael Cassel was
read the third lime and passed.
The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill
to change the times oí holding the courts of the
United States in the ninth circuit, together with the
amendments of the House theieto
Mr SEVIER moved to amend the amendment,
by changing the times of holding the circuit m
Aikansas, from the third Monday of March to the
fast Monday of October, which amendment was
adopted
Mr SEVIER submitted a further amendment
as follows
" Beitfuilhei enacted, That if any of the judges
of the circuit courts of the United States shall fail
oi refuse to hold any court belonging to the circuit
or distnct, which had been assigned him by law,
unless pi evented by sickness, such judge shall be
cons deied guilt) of a high misdemeanor "
Mr SEVIER said he thought it his duty to en-
dcavoi, in some way or other, to see that courts
were held in his State We had no circuit court
last spring m Arkansas we shall have no court
there this spring I had intended to offer an
amendment to this bill, to deduct one thousand
dollars from the salary of the judge for every court
he failed or refused to hold. But, upon reflection,
I thought such an amendment could not be adopted
consistently with the provisions of the Constitu-
tion, and, on that account alone, I had not offerf d
it The only remedy I know of, is the one I have
pioposed I know that, in íaising my voice against
the immaculability ot the judges, I shall raise
up against me a strong opposition The Judiciary
is the favorite branch of the Government But such
a consideration shall not prevent me from doing
what I conceive my duty on this or any other im-
portant subject. So far as I am concerned, if the
judges do not hold their courts, and discharge the
dutie* of their high office^ I shall, for one, pn-
dea\ oi to make them
Mr PRESTON suggested that the laws were
already sufficient to provide against nonfeasance as
247
well as malfeasance in office, and that a judge,
guilty of either, was liable to impeachment and
conviction. Without intending to express any
opinion as to the present case, he thought that an
impeachment here would do more towards securing
fidelity m the public officers than any affirmation
in the statute book
Mr CLAY of Alabama said, m reply, that the
censure which seemed to be implied in the last
remarks of the Senator fiom Arkansas, as an act of
justice to the piesent judge of the ninth circuit,
demanded some explanation So far as any thing
like neglect of duty was imputed to the judge, those
remarks were founded in mistake. He said the
present judge did not receive his commission until
the month of May last, and after the time appointed
for holding the circuit court of Arkansas of the last
yeai had passed by If the bdl undei considera-
tion had passed as it left the Senate, the time of the
court would have been fixed for the third Monday
of March, and we all know the Supreme Court had
adjom ned at loo late a period for the judge to have
reached Little Rock in time, without abandoning
his seat and neglecting the performance of his duty
here Hence the Senator from Arkansas had no
right, thus far, to complain of the present incum-
bent
Mr C also said, that at the times appointed for
holding the courts in New Orleans and Mobile last
fall, it was well known the yellow fever was pre-
vailing in both those places, and it would have been
madness for the judge to have gone there. Indeed,
if he had gone, Mr C said, he could have done
nothing, for the parties, witnesses, and jurors, could
not have been induced to attend, so that, as regarded
the circuit at large, Mr C. said there had been no
neglect of duty on the part of the judge.
Mr C said he was no apologist for any public
officer who might be guilty of a neglect of duty, but
he felt himself bound to do justice to all when
wrongfully charged He still thought the Senator
from Arkansas had better withdraw his amend-
ment, its object was sufficiently embraced by the
general doctrine already adverted to in this debate,
and there was danger of ^weakening, rather than
strengthening, that doctrine, by such specifications
as the amendment proposed.
Mr SEVIER then, at the suggestion of Mr. C
withdrew his amendment,
Mr PRESTON suggesting that he had an amend-
ment to offer, but the hour of one o'cloqk having
arrived, the subject was parsed over informally, and
The Senate resumed the consideration of the In-
dependent Treasury bill, when Mr SOUTHARD,
who had the floor, addressed the Chair m opposi-
tion to the bil, and continued his speech until a late
hour, when he gave way for a motion to go into
executive business, and then, after a short session,
The Senate adjourned.
