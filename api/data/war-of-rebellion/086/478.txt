Captain W. T. KITTREDGE:

I have report that between 800 and 1,000 rebels are crossing the road this side of Niangua. I had better detain my subsistence train until Major Rush arrives.

Major, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOLLAND,

Commanding Fourth Military district:

General Sanborn directs me to station 100 mounted men at Wardens and 100 at Sand Spring. I have ordered Captain Taylor to go to Wardens. He tells me there is a company of militia at the mill that can be sent there. Will you please to order this company to move in the morning, if it can be spared. If it cannot, then some other company, as I have none available. About sixty men of the Sixth Cavalry have been ordered to Sand Spring. Will you send a squadron there also without delay. These detachments are to patrol the road and escort all trains from Wardens to Sand Spring and from Sand Spring to this post.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. T. KITTREDGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 7, 1864.

Major George W. MURPHY,

Commanding Post of Newtonia:

MAJOR: I sent a dispatch to Saint Louis as you requested, but have received no answer yet. General Sanborn directs that you retain command at Newtonia until Major Burch returns. He also directs that all prisoners and all stick and wounded at Newtonia be sent to this post at once. There are no wagons here or I should have sent them before this. Make some arrangement with commanding officer at Mount Vernon by which these men can be sent to that post as fast as possible and forwarded from there here. Push the matter as rapidly as you possibly can. Captain Ritchey's company has been ordered back to Newtonia by General Sanborn. I sent blanks and paper to you a few days ago. No news here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. T. KITTREDGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, November 7, 1864.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK,

Saint Joseph:

I know of no Kansas militia in Platte County, but have heard of them in other portions of your State doing good service.

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
