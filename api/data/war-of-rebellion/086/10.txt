OCTOBER 16, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Jefferson City:

I leave to-night for La Mine, and will carry forward all the troops I have at California. Troops are now being forwarded from the La Mine to Sedalia. I will try and get and hold that place to-day. Please have forwarded as rapidly as possible the troops as they arrive, with artillery, transportation, ammunition, and supplies.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.

CALIFORNIA, October 16, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff:

We have Sedalia. It was Jeff. Thompson's force there yesterday, about 2,500 strong. Nothing heard from Sanborn. Push forward rations to-day as fast as possible; we have none to move with us. I have pushed forward all my command to the La Mine.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 16, 1864.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Sedalia, Mo.:

It will be best if we can keep Price somewhere in river counties, between La Mine and Lexington. To effect this you will communicate with Sanborn if possible, and place him somewhere on the Blackwater.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 16, 1864-7 p.m.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Tipton, Mo.:

The command now here is necessary to load and unload stores and preserve order. No news of Sanborn.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 16, 1864-8 p.m.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

Tipton, Mo., or beyond:

Until the position of the enemy is positively known, the general thinks you should not push your infantry force so far to the front as to risk your right flank being turned. When the cavalry arrive and cover your right flank then the infantry may be made the pivot and which the entire command may turn to face the enemy and cut off his retreat or to follow him if he retires. The general wishes you to communicate your views fully on this subject.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
