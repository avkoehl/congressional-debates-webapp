Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

There will be a little delay in sending up the paper just received from you, but it will be sent back as soon as I can possibly get the information. The report was sent during my absence, and I don't know why the number of companies was not put in. General Wright was somewhat injured this morning by a fall from his horse, out on the picket-line. It seemed serious at first, but I think he is doing well now.

Should any change take place I will notify General Williams.
