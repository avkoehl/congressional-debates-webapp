I should like a copy of the parole of Mr. Guthrey in order to know what latitude has been allowed him. If you can furnish me a copy please do so or give me an order on Colonel Martin Burke, of Fort Lafayette, for a copy. * * * *

Yours, respectfully,

S. C. HAWLEY.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, December 13, 1861.

SETH C. HAWLEY, Esq., New York.

SIR: I have received your letter of the 11th instant. In reply I inclose herewith copies of the parole+ of J. Garnett Guthrey and George Miles, which you required.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.

OFFICE OF THE SUPT. OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE,

New York, December 22, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: I have taken the affidavit of Samuel H. Hyman,++ a native of Richmond, Va., who deposes to the fact that $7,000 in bonds belonging to J. G. Guthrey are represented to be in the hands of Mr. H. C. Hardy, Numbers 47 Front street, by Guthrey to him, and also states in effect that Hardy is custodian of his confidential matters. Hyman also testifies to Guthrey having stated to him that he has written at least three letters to friends in the insurrectionary States and has received some from them. Under your former instruction I feel at liberty to arrest Guthrey on this information, but I fear he has his letters, &amp;c., in the hands of Hardy, and I need an extension of the order to Hardy and the papers in his possession. I would advise authority to that effect to be given me immediately by telegraph. I think I mentioned in a former letter that Hardy is also a Virginia and has a branch house at Norfolk.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.

OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE,
