man, and avowed his preference of the sub-ageney
system ovo all others It wa  a wise, a safe, and
polit c vvstem though it had oeen lepresented as
dargeious and al  rming, from the immense patron-
age that w as supposed would flow from it 1 ul this
patronage was nominal, and not such is to re-
quire tht people to be cautioned against It was
al ¡pays w «bin their control and whenevei it passed
its legitimate bounds, the corrective would soon be
applied To ins m nd there was not half the dan-
ger to be appiehend°d from this system that there
was to be from a national bank Look to the con-
trol that institution had ov er the actions of men, po-
litical ard mor 1, the s\v ay it exercised oyer all the
State binks, and then tell him if i  w ere not more
to be fcaied than pr>} sub-?gency s* stem that could

of this Government could be bet er earned on
thioU"h the agency ot fedeia1 officers, than
by any banking institutions whatev er Xhe Fede-
ral Governmcntcould exero seno control over those
institution^ and hence it was no! safe to make
them the depositories of the íevenue, and tne idea
of the Government depending on them, was pre-

occasion to ca t his e} e tow ard the bank of Franc",
at a time of great commercial distress, and general
prostration oí business, that m titution throws open

even paid out one-tr id of theii specie, they might
have aliayed the panic w ould have saved their cre-
dit, and made good their engagement  to the Go-
vernment Under oidmary circumstances, the
banks he supposed might be safe depositories of the
public money, when we had a cleat sky, a smooth
sea, but that was not the kind of security required
bv the National Gov eminent, it wanted its funds
where they could alwaysbe commanded, whether m
peace or wai— plenty or d stress, and unless we
adopted the Sub-Treasury, the hard money system,
we could never exnect that «atetv
It ha i been adm tel I_, the g^nt'eman fiom
South C?i n'ina (Mi C alhoun) that the Bank of the
I nited States of Pennsy'vama might restore specie
pa} ments He did not know how such a measure
could be effected now He recollected in 1816 it
was then effected, but then it was done pretty much
as a physician saves the life of a patient, by ampu-
tating the limb It was ruinous m its consequences
upon thousand , and affected moie than half the
property of the countiy Every thing was languid
and prostrate save agriculture Even there it w ?s
merely partial in its operation—the meichants and
monejed men, who had an interest m sustaining
the e institutions, did not press the n for specie
With legard to the lehef of the eountn , he would
ask gentlemen what relief they expected'' Did
the} s ipprse tliat we came hereto pioude some
meas ires bv whi"a to pay off the debts of the mer-
(ivnts' Wl at !  wou d inquire, were thp evils
i dti w hicn the cr mmunity were now suffering''
They were two The fii°t was the existence of
d bt, and the spcond a dunngement of the curren-
ts These difficulties co operating together, had
aggravated each olhei.and produced the present
distress thiojgno.it the count} Now, as to the
idea of the? Government paving oft th  debts of the
merchants, tl at was entne v out ot the question,
foi the Go "inment could do no such thing He
did n it attrihnte, principle , the patalvzed state of
the Union to the evils growing out ot pa
nnsound cuuency Tint, he apprehended,
was not the essential cause of it, for theie
was not that want of confidence in the banks,
as the gen'leman from Vngmn (Mr Rives)
bad  vesteida}   intimated,   for   the    bank   cur-
rency still answ ered all the puiposes it had ever
done He (Mr N ) would repeat, that the gieat
and essential difficul} existing was debt The
question now was, Can wc do any thing for tie re-
lief of the community' Ought w e to do it? He
thought we ought He, for one, was disposed to do
all that could ughtfully and properly be done He
thought that, so far as the Government had a di-
leet connection with the business of the country—
for "we had large demands against the deposite
banks and against the merchants—it became us to
do something We were about to effect tKat object,
and the measure undei consideration was to be one
of the mediums of pioducmg relief Did any gen-
tleman piesent deny that these measures were not
calculated to carry out our wishes' He thought
not Notwithstanding the resource^ of the Govern-
ment, it felt it=elf compelled to íesort to the issue of
Treasury notes That couise was absolute!} ne-
cessary to afford lempoiary relief And these notes
would be considered as equivalent to specie for all
purposes Some gentlemen were for going fuither
tnan this, and say Inat we onghtto pass some dnect
measure ot relief The gentleman from Vir-
¡ g nia (Mr Rives) had ai<me<i that we should idopt
some measure that would redore confidence to tne
banks He (Mi N ) knew not what we cot Id i'o
to accomplish that object, unless gentlemen would
have us iec°ive the notes of the State banks Was
that the measure the gentleman alluded to' He,
however, did not say so There had been no w ant
of confidence in 'hose institutions Indeed, he
w as astonished that so much confidence was felt m
them now And, if he might be permitted to say
so, it was owing to the existence of too mu*h con
fidence in the banks thp t had brou^1 about the
present difficulties
But the gentleman seemed to think that it vv as
the duty of Congress to afford soi íe relief to tht
b inks N w how could we do that' He saw no
o hei mol  of n git except by g vingt lem Urn ,
bv exten 1 ng lothemcveiy reasonabl  in lulgence
The evils of ike banking «¡j stem were not to be
reached by any measure that could come from Con-
gress, and the sooner the public mind was disabused
of that impression the better A false direction had
been given to public sentiment, for the impression
had been spread abroad that Congress was called
together to relieve the people—to pay off their
debts, he (Mr N ) supposed He repeated that it
was high time that the public mind should be
set right on the subject of the Gov ernment po ses-
smg the pow er to regula'e the currency He enter-
tainpd no doubt that as oil" blanch, at least, of th 
Government had done its duty, that the other would
also do theirs on the gieat question pending befoie
Congress It was time that such a delusion was
swept aw ay The peop'e should be told tnat the
evils of (he State humbug banking system must be
corrected by themselves and that Congiess posses-
sed no powei to act on the subject
