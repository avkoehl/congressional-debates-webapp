3304:
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 10,
What the people of that, mighty valley
want, and what all our citizens in all sections
need, what mankind need, for the most perfect
development of themselves and their resources
is merely honest, personal libertyâ€”the right
to buy and sell where they please, and manage
their own private affairs for themselves. That
is my idea of honest and equal civil govern-
ment Relieve my people from the payment
of bounty to anybody, and require them only
to pay taxes for revenue and they will be con-
tent. They do not now beset your lobbies
with importunities to increase or to continue
bounty. But my people do solemnly protest
against all laws enacted in the interests of
favored classes. They insist that every citizen
is entitled to equal consideration, favor, and
protection from his Government. They do not
ask their Representative here to be guided by
any spirit of sectionalism or selfishness. The
producer of iron is no inoie meritorious than
the fanner who produces wheat, corn, or other
produces of the soil. The man who makes pig
iron is no better citizen than the one who raises
potatoes. The one neither needs nor deserves
bounty from his neighbors more than the other.
Now, Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley,] I am sorry to
say, wasted his (ive minutes a little while ago
by having read by the Clerk a waif that he
found floating.upon the surface of the news-
paper press, if he thinks he can by such means
withdraw my attention from the proper and
manly discussion of this great, subject, let me
say to him oncc lor all that he mistakes me.
If 1 saw my duty less cleaily than I do, possi-
bly he might divert me lor a moment at least.
But my convictions are absorbing and impera-
tive. 1 cannot be unfaithful to them. I must
regard the interests alike of all the people,
and my sacred obligations to the Constitution.
The latter forbids sectional or class legislation.
It gives no countenance To bounty or extortion;
it regards alone the interests of the whole
country.
1 will make my peace with my own con-
stituents without any aid from the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kut.LEY. ] It may
be that some of the good people of the West
have been misled somewhat by his sellish and
sectional theories, lint theyare being rapidly
undeceived. The great body of agriculturists
are intelligent and just men. The people en-
gaged in other industries an also good and
true citizens. They only ask for just and
honest laws. They neither want bounty nor
to pay bounty. But if by possibility any of
them want these things, then I confess 1 am
not, the proper person to represent them here.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania may be, for
lie believes iu bounty lor the favorites. 1 do
not. If one is entitled to bounty, then all are.
But. as soon as you make your bounty equal to
all it ceases to be useful to any. Protection-
ists do not want it distributed. They would
absorb it for themselves.
If there is anything in the wide range of our
products that is more indispensable to industry
und progress than any other, itis iron, and es-
pecially in its crude forms. It is sold now in
this and every other country at very high prices, j
ihe manufacturers in our country are to-day I
realizing more generous profits from it than 1
those of any other country, and more than |
they themselves ever did before. Its produc i
tion costs no more now than it did a year or
two years ago. Its manufacture is a firmly
and powerfully established business. It needs
to-day for its most vigorous, profitable, and
continued growth, not a cent in bountv. If
there were not a custom-house on our sea-
board this industry could defy competition,
and yet the citizens engaged in it make more
rapid fortunes than those iu most other pur- .
suits They have always realized magnificent :
incomes as compared with the net earnings of i
agriculture or any other unprotected industry. i
The establishment of absolute free tiade in :
Great Britain iu all thebe great industries has i
proved to be most beneficial to all classes and
pursuits. All have gone on in prosperity and
development.
Now, Mr. Chairman, I want to say that dur-
ing the last year there were produced in this
country nearly two million tons of pig iron,
and we imported only two hundred and ten
thousand tons. The importation was very
small compared with the home production.
Ever since the great advance in the progress
of the world in all material developments there
has been an increase in the demand for iron.
Its price has been advanced everywhere; and
here I wish to state a fact I know, that within
the last seven months there have been paid in
this country on railroad iron tweuty-five dol-
lars a ton more than was paid on the same
kind of iron one year ago; and yet the cost
of that ton of railroad iron has not increased
one penny, not one penny I Tell me that is
not protection gone to seed! Tell me that is
not protection riyi into robbery ! Tell me that
is honest toward the people of this country who
want to build railroads, who want cheap trans-
portation, who are compelled in ten thousand
ways to use the products of iron 1 Yet after
all these things yon insist, you gentlemen who
have had the benefit of bounty so long, insist
to day, in the evening of the nineteenth cen-
tury, that you are still in a condition of infancy.
God_protect the people against your manhood
if this is your infancy!
[Ilere the hammer fell.]
Mr. TOWNSEND, of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Chairman, I marvel much that the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Kerr] should have fallen
into the gross error he has committed while
endeavoring to impress on the mind of the
House that the rate of duty oil pig iron to-day
is forty-two per cent. He is but a poor arith-
metician if such has been his calculation. If
the net market price is fifty dollars in New
York, it would only amount to fourteen per
cent, at the present duty of seven dollars per ton.
If he be no more correct in his figures in regard
to other matters than he is in regard to that, his
statements ought not to have any weight here.
1 he argument of gentlemen in favor of re-
duction of duty on iron is that it will decrease
tlie price to the consumer. 1 want to call the
attention of the revenue reformers to the fact
that their Iree-trade leader, the man in whose
footsteps they are following to-day, less than
a month ago, in a letter he wrote and pub-
lished the other day in the Tribune, tells you
emphatically as his conviction that if the tariff
ot seven dollars a ton on pig iron be taken off
not a dollar will result in benefit to the people
of America, but the price will go up to that
amount in England and to the benefit of the
manufacturers there. That is the solemn opin-
ion ofa free-trader, and itis an effectual answer
to gentlemen on the otliei side that a reduction
of duty is necessarily a reduction of price.
The gentleman from Indiana wants to know
whether Kentucky received any benefit from
a protective tariff. I can answer him in the
words of the speakers who took part in the
great discussion of 1842, when that protective
tariff was about to be enacted. When that
was up for consideration, Calhoun contended
that he had proved that the duty on hemp and
its manufaciures would be a tax on the cotton
interest of $1,422,222 a year. When the tariff
of 1846 was under debate, Toombs, of Georgia
proved by figures that Calhoun was wrong, and
that the protection to hemp and cotton bagging
had lowered prices more than Calhoun had
said they would be raised. Mr.Toombs said;
" Since the introduction of the business of making
cotton bagging m Kentucky, since our countrymen
have conic into competition in producing it, the
price of bagging has fjllon to less than one third of
its average price before that period. We now make
good bagging in Kentucky more than five cents per
yard less than it cost in Dundee in 1812, and for
three or four cents a yard less than the present price
in Scotland. The price of cotton bagging in 1838
ranged from eighteen to twenty cents per yard; in
1841, from twenty-five to twenty-seven ccnts, and in
1816, from eight and a half to nincand a half cents.
Bale rope in 1838 from seven to eight cents per pound-
in 1811, from eleven to twelve cents; in 1840 from three
to four cents."
This, Mr. Chairman, is an effectual answer
to the gentleman from Indiana as to what
benefits Kentucky realized from a protective
tariff. The gentleman from Minnesota, [Mr.
Dunnell,] who spoke a few minutes ago,
wanted toknovv bow this protective tariff bene-
fited agriculturists. I live in an agricultural
and manufacturing community. The manu-
facturing interest consumes the products of
the agricultural, and when I go into the rec-
ords of the county courts, and look at the money
loaned out on bond and mortgage by the peo-
ple, I find nine tenths of it is loaned by the
farmers to manufacturers and others. 'I'liey
are the men who to-day are reaping the bene-
fits from the duty on iron.
The gentleman spoke in regard to railroad
iron, and he said the duty raised the price. I
wish him to recollect before the duty was put
in 1856 upon Bessemer steel the importation
price was over two hundred dollars a' ton, and
after the duty was imposed it fell down to
$100 a ton and even less. And I want gentle-
men to answer this question ; if the duty in
this bill is an oppressive duty on the manufac-
turer of iron and on the consumer, why was it
that some seventy or eighty railway compa-
nies came to the Congress ot the United States
a few years ago and wanted a higher duty or
tariff on iron than we granted under the tariff
of 1870? They knew their own interests well,
and that such protection would reduce the
price to all consumers. That the difference in
prices is greatly independent of tai ill's is
shown by the following table of prices as they
existed in December, 1869, and in December,
1871, alter the tariff of 1870 was m operation:

This exposes the fallacy of the whole theory
of ihe revenue reformers, that a reduction of
the duty will insure cheaper commodities to
tho people, and demonstrates that prices are
the result of other causes, such as demand
and supply and the condition of wages and
the currency.
Mr. COX. Mr. Chairman, is it in order to
move to strike out this whole section ?
Mr. KERB. I would suggest to my friend
