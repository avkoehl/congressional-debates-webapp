Report of Colonel John T. Wilder, Seventeenth Indiana Infantry,

commanding First Brigade (Mounted Infantry).
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, November 27, 1863.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS, Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit the report of Colonel John T. Wilder, Seventeenth Regiment Indiana Volunteers, commanding brigade of mounted infantry, of the operations of his brigade in co-operation with the main portion of the Army of the Cumberland before and after the evacuation of Chattanooga by the rebel army, including the battle of Chickamauga, and up to the time of the assembling of the army at Chattanooga.

For his ingenuity and fertility of resource in occupying the attention of an entire corps of the rebel army while our army was getting around its flank, and for his valor and the many qualities of a commander displayed by him in the numerous engagements of his brigade with the enemy before and during the battle of Chickamauga, and for the excellent service rendered by him generally, I would respectfully recommend him to the President of the United States for an appointment as brigadier-general.*

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General, Commanding.
