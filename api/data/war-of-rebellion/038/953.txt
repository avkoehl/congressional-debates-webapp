Most of the command has draws to include the 10th. Some of the rice is damaged, but I will grind it, and make it go as far as possible. There is an abundance of sugar, which, when the bread has been consumed, can be substituted with rice.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT MISS. AND EASTERN La.,Vicksburg, June 7, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

GENERAL: I am still without information from you later than your dispatch of the 25th. The enemy continues to intrench his positions around Vicksburg. I have sent out couriers to you almost daily. The same men are constantly in the trenches, but are still in good spirits, expending your approach.

The enemy is so vigilant that it is impossible to obtain reliable information. When may I expect you to move, and in what direction? My subsistence may be put down for about twenty days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON.

CANTON, June 7, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

We are nearly ready to move, but don't know the best route. Cooperation is absolutely necessary. Tell us how to effect it, and by what route to approach.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston. *

CANTON, June 7, 1863.

Major-General WALKER, Yazoo City:

I have been waiting for Jackson to get into position fairly, to dismount all the mounted infantry and send it back to its brigades, and take the best horses for cavalry service.

How many artillery horses do you want? The chief quartermaster reports an abundance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. Johnston.
