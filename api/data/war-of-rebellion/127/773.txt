homogeneous in character and identified with her social and political institutions.

The exercise by her and her sister Confederate States of their unquestionable right as sovereignties to withdraw their delegation of powers from an agent which had violated their confidence and set at defiance their authority has brought down upon their people the malice and vengeance of the despotic Government at Washington. The people of the States at the North, under the control and direction of Abraham Lincoln and his conspirators against their own Constitution and laws, have invaded our peaceful shores and madly threaten our subjugation. When this unholy and cruel war shall close, as close it must in disaster and shame upon the heads of its authors, the civilized world will stand amazed at the folly and wickedness of a people whose liberties were achieved by the combined toil and commingled blood of their fathers and our fathers fighting together for the inalienable right of self-government. Our coasts may be ravaged, our cities and towns reduced to ashes, our fertile fields may wither beneath the tread of a hostile foe, and our happy homes made desolate, and this proud capitol of a great and free people-its halls sanctified by their ordinance of secession and the Constitution of the Confederate States of America-may be demolished by the guns of the enemy, but the sacred right of self-government, inherited from our fathers and stamped with their life's blood, Alabamians never will surrender. But as there is a just God above us, who teareth down and buildeth up empires, the God of our fathers, who conducted them to victory while engaged in the same righteous cause, and who has already graciously our arms with triumphs, we commit the issues into His hands, and with humble confidence and sustaining faith that, though through toil and privation and treasure and blood it must be achieved, we shall drive the invaders from our land, and finally establish these Confederate States of America among the separate and independent powers of the earth.

States caring not what freedom's cost may be,

May soon or late, but must at last, be free.

Warned, however, by the mad fury of the enemy and the mighty struggles now being made by land and by sea to plunder, oppress, and humiliate our people, and relying, as the Confederate States do and must, upon their own unaided power for their defense, it becomes our first duty as a wise people to develop and husband all our resources, and to devote all the ability of the State to maintain the high position she has assumed, and in unity with her sister Confederate States to uphold the arm of constituted authority, and to fight on and fight ever until we conquer a peace which shall not only compel an acknowledgment of our confederacy system, but which shall bring us a deliverance, full and unrestricted, from all commercial dependence upon, as well as from all social and political complications with, a people who appreciate neither the value of liberty nor the sanctity of compacts. Alabama did not separate from them a day, not an hour, too soon, and while a speedy peace might be grateful to our love of case and present comfort, and might save many a heart from anguish, the permanent good of the State and the Confederacy will be most certainly attained by that degree of suffering that amount of endurance and self-sacrifice, which shall consolidate the masses and unite our people in the fixed and irrevocable purpose to maintain as perfect an independence of the United States as of all other organized
