HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 27, 1863.

W. SCOTT BELDEN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Collierville, Tennessee:

Hold your ground at Collierville; you have force enough to repel a dash. Time is everything, as Grierson is moving up with infantry by train from La Grange. I hardly think they will attack you, but mean to pass off south, and are clearing the road.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

COLLIERVILLE, December 27, 1863.

General HURLBUT:

We can hold the fort against almost any odds and will do it.

BELDEN.

COLLIERVILLE, December 27, 1863-2.30 p. m.

General HURLBUT:

Have sent 100 mounted men, being every available man in camp to La Fayette with instructions to hold the enemy in check as long as possible.

W. SCOTT BELDEN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

LA GRANGE, December 27, 1863-10.45 a. m.

Lieutenant A. W. McCLURE,

Headquarters Cavalry Division:

Has Captain Charlestworth sent patrols out toward Raleigh, as per instructions of yesterday? Has he any now? He must keep patrols up this way and guard the crossings of Wolf. Forrest was at Somerville last night and reported to have moved west after dark. He may attempt to cross Wolf toward Memphis.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,La Grange, Tennessee, December 27, 1863.

Major COON,

Commanding Cavalry, Grand Junction:

MAJOR: The telegraph will not work to Corinth. Patrols in from New Castle report seeing 25 rebels near there; think there was a large force. Dispatch from Moscow about an hour and a half ago states that the Ninth Illinois met the enemy 1 1/2 miles west of Moscow, skirmished, and drove them. The enemy retreated south. You will send re-enforcements to the road crossing the railroad east of you, and keep your patrols running.
