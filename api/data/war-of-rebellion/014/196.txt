Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General McClellan is now at Hanover Court-House, where he may remain overnight. The results of the battle of yesterday, as far as ascertained, are as follows, viz: Our loss 300 killed and wounded -none missing; enemy's loss at least 500 killed and wounded. Our troops buried 100 of their dead. There were two battles - the first near the Court-House, in which the rebels were driven from their positions, and retreated some distance, when they were re-enforced and came back, and after a sharp contest they were again badly whipped and partially routed. Our cavalry and light artillery pursued and captured the prisoners. The victory was decisive, and the prisoners say will have a very demoralizing effect upon their army. These troops came from Gordonsville, and are from North Carolina and Georgia. Many of those from the former State say that they are tired of the war.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

Secretary of War:

I learn that there are 5,000 serviceable muskets at Fort Monroe, which will be sent at once to Yorktown. The Colonel of Ordnance has been requested by telegraph to furnish accouterments for these. There are also at least 5,000 muskets at White House, which have been turned in in exchange for better arms, and about 3,000 at Yorktown. These arms are at present more or less unserviceable, but instructions have been given for their immediate repair, and they will doubtless be ready for issue again in a few days. There are, however, no accouterments for the 8,000 muskets at Yorktown and White House, and I advise that
