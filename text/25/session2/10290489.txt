Mr BENTO\ replied to the Senator from New
Hampshire, [Mr Pierce,] and showed that the in-
crease of the staff which I e spoke of was nominal,
not real, that it occasioned but few additional per-
sons to be employed in that blanch of me service,
and actually lessened, insto? J ot incieasmg, the
expense in. the branches of the staff which occa-
sioned the remark  oí the benatoi from New
Hampshire, f he engineers had particularly at-
tracted his atiention, and exc ted hi. remarks, but a
lookmlo the blue book would s¡k>vv him that with
an apparent moi-ease of above seventy ofliceis, m

Theie is, therefore, 1 further gam 111 the reduction
of expense, as wed as in the reduction of numbers,
but t'est ar  i ol the only sains The person who

Having shown how great was the error oí the
Senator from New Hampshire [Mr Piercf] m te-
la'ion to the two corps of engineers, Mr. B thea
went on to show that he was also in error id regard
to ihe oidnance, where an increase of twenty offi-
cers was counted, when, m fact, there was no in-
crease at all, the twenty ofPcers^idded tc that corps
being mere!} so many trans/a>ei froto the aríiller}.
Soof tl equartermaster'sdepartment TJpontheface
of the bill there would seem to be an increase of
twenty-eight, but, by look.ng into the existing laws
índ the present state o^that corps, and it would be
seen that twenty of the twenty eighty are alreatiy
there This reduces the appaient inciease to
eight but by the supplemental bill w hich the
Military Ce mmittee ef the two Houses had
digested, and which he [Mr B] should offer as
soon ?s Ihe main bill passed these twenty-eight offi-
ce s w ould no' be detached from the line of the ai my,
they v ould continue to be officers of the line per-
foi tning duly in the slaff Thus the increase of
the staff will, peihaps, be twodo7 n, instead of the
ore hundred and thirty three, which the Senator
from New Hampshire suppos s, and of thi in-
crease a partwi'l 1 ndoubtedly be taken from ths
ohcois ot th^, line Ha'ing shown these errors
with respect to tho increase ef the staff, Mr B,
went on to show that toeSvnator fromNett Hamp-
shire \v?s also in an error with respect to the
efficers of the hue He sijs one hundred and
forty-six new officers a>e created b} the bill, of
whiih only thirteen are officers of ihe line Tms
