Major-General THOMAS:

The following communication has just been received from opposite Jackson's Ford:

OCTOBER 31, 1864-7 a. m.

I have just communicated with General Croxton's command at Rogersville. He has one company at that point. Enemy has crossed at Bainbrigade and captured small portions of Second Michigan and Eighth Iowa Cavalry. The cannonading last evening was at that place. They are reported crossing in force at mouth of Shoal Creek and pressing General Croxton back. Major Williams, Tenth Indiana, is between Brown's Ferry and Elk River.

G. R. SWALLOW,

Major Tenth Indiana Cavalry.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have been trying all day to get some regiments to Athens, but can get no transportation. It is fifteen miles from here and fifteen more from there to Elk River. As I could not march troops there before the enemy could get to the river I suggested to General Stanley to detach a portion of his force for that purpose this morning, and only this afternoon learned that he was under orders from you to move to Pulaski. On the receipt of this information I ordered the garrison and artillery at Athens to move to this place. I understand the enemy was crossing Shoal Creek at 10 a. m. this morning. If this be so he will be at Elk River to-night, if he goes that way. General Croxton thinks he will go by Lawrenceburg, but my information leads me to believe he will cross to Athens. I have no fears whatever of Wheeler, unless he is joined by other forces, with the view of taking this place. I always maintained that this was essential to the enemy, and think so still. They must have some secure place get out of the country and this is a perfect one with that view. The transportation I spoke of has been promised me all day, and when I was about to receive it the cars ran off the track. When they are removed the provision train must go forward to General Stanley first, as they have been loaded since yesterday.
