HEADQUARTERS,Montgomery, January 12, 1861.

Colonel D. LEADBETTER,

Aide - de Camp, Mobile, Ala.:

COLONEL: Governor Moore is in receipt of your report of the capture of mount Vernon arsenal, and requests me to express to you his entire satisfaction and gratification at the manner in which you and the officers and troops under your command have discharged your duty in that enterprise. The charge for the steamer appears erroneous. Fifteen hundred dollars of the amount will be paid now, and the balance held over for further inquiry and consideration. No disposition of the arms or public property taken in the forts can be made at present. The Governor regrets, therefore, that he cannot comply with Mr. Shepherd's wishes to have the rifles.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. J. SEIBELS,

Aide - de - Camp.
