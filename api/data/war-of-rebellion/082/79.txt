HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, July 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS:

Two battalions of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery, Colonel Seward, accompanied General Ricketts. One battalion remains here attached to the Artillery Brigade, of 550 men. One hundred and seventy-one are familiar with the artillery drill. We know nothing of those who have gone, but presume that the proportion is about the same.

(Received 9.30 p. m.)

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Report for to-night: The remaining battalion of the Ninth New York Heavy Artillery, of General Ricketts' division, have been ordered to City Point and Washington. I am expecting notice every moment that they have started, and have notified General Ingalls of the number of men. Some delay was caused by the command being so much separated, one company being in charge of the mortars at the ammunition train; about sixty men scattered amongst battery and artillery guards at the different trains and hospitals.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

I have the honor to report that everything has been quiet on my lines to-day up to 5 p. m., when artillery and infantry firing from the rebel lines, commencing on General Smith's front, swept down my lines. The enemy did not leave their works. It lasted about half an hour. No damage done.
