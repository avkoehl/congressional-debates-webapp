Second Brigade returning, the read of the First Brigade having just filed off on the road DA. We pushed on to the head of the column and found General Wallace, when I delivered my instructions, and told him for "God's sake to move forward rapidly."

I understood him to say that his guide had led him wrong, and I was most decidedly of the impression that he had mistaken the road, for his command had already marched a great deal farther than was necessary to reach the battle-field.

I told him, however, to hurry on and we might yet be there in time. I thought we could get there; sun three-quarters an hour high. We did not, however, reach the ground until after dark.

After I had reached the head of the column I must say it seemed to me that the march was not as rapid as the urgency of the case required. Perhaps this arose in a great measure from my impatience and anxiety to get this force on the field before dark, as I knew very well unless we arrived before sunset we could be of on use in that day's battle and would not ne able to retrieve the fortunes of the day.

Very respectfully,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
