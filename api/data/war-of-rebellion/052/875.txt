SIGNAL STATION IN REAR OF CRITTENDEN, September 26, 1863-11.40 a.m.

Colonel G. E. FLYNT:

I have discovered one rebel signal station east 53 degrees south of my station. The house at which they have established their station appears to be the headquarters of some general, a number of walltents being pitched all around. They run two stations from the house, one of which apparently communicates with the Lookout Mountain.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS, September 26, 1863.

General GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

SIR: I have just returned from opposite the right of General McCook's line, and from a high eminence to the other side of the run I discover in the valley and apparently on Sand Mountain great quantities of dust. I observed it for half an hour, and it seemed to me to increase rather than diminish. The point that I was at is about three-quarters of a mile below the lower bridge.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant.

B. D. WILLIAMS,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
