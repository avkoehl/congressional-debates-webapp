shows the progressive increase of the ordinary
sales, wah the exception of the year 1831, wh.ch
did not equal those of 1831 by 315,514 acres, in
consequence, principally, of thegeneralprevalence
of the Asiatic cholera in many of those districts to
which emigration tended, and from which it usu-
ally emanates, and the Indian war tfrudi pervaded
the northern frontier of Illinois and the western
part of Michigan.
A schedule of forfeited land stock, issued and
received at the several land offices, under the pro-
visions of the acts of Congress of May 23, 1828,
March 31,1830, and July 9, 1832, i  herewith ap-
pended, marked D. It shows the amount issued
and received at each office in each of the years
1828, lb29, 1830, 1831, 1832, and the first three
quaiters of 1833, the total amount issued and re-
ceived in each year, the whole amount at each office
during that peuod, with their íespeetive giand
totals. The small balance of less than §16,400 of
the whole amount issued remained to be received
and accounted for at this office on the 30th of
September last.
By the act of May 30, 1830, there were appro-
priated 260 000 acies of land, subject to private
entry, in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, to satisfy the
unlocated military bounty land warrants of the
Vnginia State line and navy, 50,000 acres of the
Vnginia Continental lihe, and an unlimited quan
tity for the United States military warrants, for
services rendered in the revolutionary war, and
scrip was authored to be issued in eighty-acre
tracts in lieu of said wairants The act of July
13, 1832, made an additional appiopnation of
300,000 acres for the Virginia Continental line and
the State hnejind navy; and, by the ac  of March
2, 1833, the fuither quantity of 200,000 acres was
appiopuated foi the Vnginia warrants, to be lo-
ca'ed on any of the public lands liable to sale at
private entry, making a total foi Virginia warrants
of 810,000 acies Or this quantity senp had been
isqiipd, or prepared to be issued, by the Secretary
oí the Treasury, on the 15-h of Ñovemhei instan*,
for 772,424 aci es, leaving a balance of 37,576 acres,
the warrants foi which have been fled, and the
scrip will be issued theieon so soon as the tule
papéis thereof shall be completed The schedule
hereunto annexed, marked É, exhibits a summary
statement of the number of wairants which have
been satisfied of each class or descnption, the
quantity of land foi which scrip has been issued,
its amount in money, at one dollar and twentv five
cents per acre; together with the total number of
certificates of senp issued Virginia warrants have
already been filed for about 10,000 acres, exceed-
ing the amount which can be satisfied with scnp
out of the anpropnattons which have been made.
I have no meansof ascer'aimng the amount of out-
standing Virginia wanants not yet filed in this
office, and it will be for the decision of Congiess
whe'hei further provisions shall be made to satisfy
the same.
The annexed statement, maiked V, shows the
amount, in money, of the military land scrip íe
ceived in payment for public lardi at the «everal
land offices in the years 1S30, 1831, lP3°,ard
the first three q lariers of 1833, with the total
amount in each year in each State and at each
office, with the giand total. It will apoeai firm
this statement, that of the whole amount of scrip
ssued, ($1,063,592) there had been íeceiveJ at
the land offices and accounted for at th's oíñre,
on theüOthof Septembei last, the sum of ^754 827,
and that of this sum moie than one half has
been taken at the Zanesv lie office, m Ohio, nn)
¡i the office of Indianapolis, m Indiana It is
altogether, in my opirion. lrreconclable with the
oidmaiy course of such business, rnd the usual
cuuent of public siles, that so large a portion
should have been íeoeived at these two office*,
without the connivance or direct agency of the
land officers and their clerks, or one or more of
them at each office, by which scrip has been
taken in cases where otherwise cash would have
been received Other offices have also leceived
and transmitted an unexpected amount, m conse-
quence of which measuies have been taken to
asceitain the facts and encumstances connected
wah these tiansactions, and explications have
been required of the officers Before the close of
the i resent session of Congiess the Department
will be able to show the causes and agencies which
have contributed to throw this species of propen-
so rapidly upon the Government
The appropriation of seven thousand dollars
made at tne last session of Congress for extra
clerk hire for this office, has enabled me to pro-
gress with its current business toa very consider-
able extent, and to great advantage to those most
interested, and to the Government. Out of that
appropriation there have been opened twenty two
tiact books, containing the entries of the tracts
of 504 ¿ownships; the posting of about 17,000
entries of lands sold, besides the writing and rec-
ording of more than 13,000 patents, and the
perfoimance of a large amount of miscellaneous
business equally pressing and important. Yet,
notwithstanding the benefits which have resulted
from that appropriation, the force of the office
piovided by law has been inadequate fo the dis-
charge of its current duties, and leaving, at the
close of the present year, a greater aggregate
amount of arrears than existed on the 1st of Jan-
uary last.
On the passage of the act of March 2, 1833,
providing for the anpointment of a secretary to
sign patents in the name of the President, there
were written and recorded, and prepared for sig-
nature, more than twenty thousand patents for
lands sold. In consequence of the provisions of
that act it became necessary to alter the date of
execution of each patent and the record thereof,
and the endorsement of the certificate on which
the same was founded. This seivice was an ex-
pense to the office of moie than six hundred dol-
lars, requiring, on all the documents, more than
s'xty thousand alterations or additions, and,m
effect, abstiacted that sum fiom the appropriation
for the salaries of the permanent clerks I would,
therefore, for the purpose of reimbursing that
amount to the office, respectfully recommend a
speciat appropriation of six hundred dolíais, to
be expended in writing and recording four thou-
sand patents, which would diminish that branch
of arrears without interfeiirg with current du-
ties
The unfortunate destruction of the Treasury
building by fire admonished me of the propriety
and absolute necessity of adopting eveiy precau-
tionaiy measure to secure the safety of the title
papers, records, and other important documents
which constitute the archives of this office. On a
pa.ticulai examination, with a view to that object,
it was found that about two tons of the papers,
embracing a la^ge portion which belonged to the
ciedit system of the land sales, were deposited m
the attic story of the building, immediately under
(he roof, in the utmost confusion, in bundles ar-
ranged neither in chronological order nor in the
order of consecutive numbers On a representa
tion of these facts to the then Secretary of the
Treasuiy, and by his advice, I have adopted those
means which would secure to the Government and
to the extensive regions of the Ohio and Missis-
sippi the safety and security of those documents,
which aie connected with the land titles of more
than three millions of whitepopu'ation. Portable
esses foi al1 papers and documents not of daily
use, and file bass for each room of the office, have
been contiacted for, and will be delivered in the
courseof two or three weeks, wh le theassortment
and theainngement of the title papers are in rapid
piogiess by peisons especially employed in that
service The plan adopted, and which, when com-
pleted, as it w ill be in two or thiee months, will
enable twenty able-! od'ed men, in case of file, to
íemove fiom the office eveiy paper, document,
1 ook, and lecord o''the same *o aplire of security
mfiltetnnunvtes, wit1 out the derangement of eithei,
so that m case the roof and second stoiy of the
building should oe in flames, everything belonging
to the Land Office, except its furniture, could be
saved and removed by the ordinary assistance
which is found in the case of fiies The whole
expense of these necessary and piecautionary
Pleasures will amount to about twenty six hundred
dolíais, for wh>ch a special appropriation is íe
spectfully lequested.
One of the most serious causes which have
produced the delays and embaria<=sments to the
performance of the oidinaiy business of tins office
is the want of the statutes and the reports of the
adjudicated decisions of the highest courts o «justice
m the seveial States.   The daily necessity of a
recurrence to such documents, and the difficulty of
obtaining access to the same, has been the occasion
of vexatious delays, in numerous instances, to the
parties immediately interested, and to the prompt
discbarge of official duty. This can be remedied by
a special appiopnation for that purpose of about
twenty five hundred dollars, which is lespectfully
and urgently recommended. It is frequently the
case that a resort to these statutes, and the reported
decisions thereon, is absolutely necessary to a
conect action on questions arising under the law
of descent, the jurisdiction of probate matters, the
settlement and distribution of intestate estates, the
law of judgments and executions, and the lien
created thereby, with the law of assurances, or
conveyances in relation to leal estate. Access to
these sources of information is often indispensable
to the security of individual rights, and important
to the pecuniary interests of the Government. In
many of the States some of the principles of the
common law have been declared inapplicable to
the peculiar circumstances of the people and the
country, and inconsistent with the genius and pro-
visions of our political institutions, and others
havebeen substituted by legislative adoption, com-
patible with constitutional rights and the immu-
nities of the citizen. Hundreds of questions are
presented every year, in the administration of the
powers and duties of this office, involving the
examination and application of legal principles
connected with the subjects above enumeiated;
and it is a matter of surpnse"to me that more com-
plaints have not been made against the decisions
of the Commissioner in cases where he has been
called upon to decide, without the requisite legal
information to do so understandingly. In many
instances, I have no doubt, they have been sub-
mitted to lather than incur the expense of an
appeal to the administrative justice in the United
States courts. These evils should no longer pre-
vail, and the excuse for them should cease to exist
by the appropriate action of Congress. The small
sum necessary to be appropriated cannot come in
competition with the resulting benefits to indi-
viduals and to the Government. There is, prob-
ably, no bureau under the executive departments
which requires so frequent recurrence to the stat-
utes and judicial decisions of the several States as
that of ttie General Land Office, and in which
they are so necessary to the administration of
right and justice In truth, it has become in prac-
tice, from necessity, a court of exchequer, where
us decisions are tacitly assented to from ignorance
of the law, or acquiesced in fiom pecuniary con-
siderations. My duty to the Government and to
individual rights requires this statement from me,
as an act of justice to the parties interested, and as
highly proper and impoitant for the legislative
action of Congress.
Although theabove statements and exhibits show
that the duties of this office are annually incieasing
and rapidly accumulating, it is proper for me to say
that they present but a small portion of the items
of such increase. Exclusive of the correspondence
with the Secretary of the Treasury, m relation to
the issue of military bounty land scrip since the
fiist of January last, which is equal to the wilting
j and recording of 342 letters, and the letters written
to the several land officers, acknowledging the
receipt of their monthly and quarterly returns,
amounting to 1,150 to the 15th of the present
month, there have been written in the office, on
other subjects, from the fiist of January last to
the 15th instant, including copies of a portion of
ihe samp, 4 529 'etters, occupying on the record
thereof 3,047 large folio pages During the pres-
ent year there will have been issued and trans-
mitted from the office more than fmty thousand pat-
ents, leaving an arrear of patents for land sold, at
tne close of the year, in amount exceeding seventy
thous4\d To this should be added, besides other
meieesmg demands upon the office, the lequire-
ments of individuals for copies of the papéis, rec-
oi ds, correspondence, and othei documents, to be
used in the administration of justice, the settle-
ment of intestate estates, to supply the loss or
destruction of the ongmals, and for other lawful
pui poses, which will amount for the present year,
at twelve and a half cents peroné hundred woids,
to a sum exceeding three thousand dollars This
class of requisitions upon the time and duties of
tneofficei mast annually increase with the progi ess
