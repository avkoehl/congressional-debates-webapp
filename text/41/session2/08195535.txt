5535
eluded, and bills and joint resolutions and
Senate resolutions are still in order.
Mr. SCOTT. Do I understand the Senator
from Kansas to object?
The VICE PRESIDENT. He states that
he does object.
Mr. POMEROY. For the present, in order
to see if the chairman of the committee will
come in.
CONGRESSIONAL GL0B13.
Mr. HARRIS, from the Committee on Print-
ing, reported a jointresolution (S. R. No. 249)
in relation to the purchase of sets of the Con-
gressional Globe and Appendix.
The joint resolution was read the first time.
It proposes to direct the Secretary of the Sen-
ate and the Clerk of the House of Represent-
atives to purchase from the publishers of the
Congressional Globe and Appendix, for each
Senator, Representative, and Delegate in the
Forty-First Congress who has not heretofore
received them, one complete set of the Con-
gressional Globe and Appendix, at a price per
volume not exceeding the price per volume
paid for the sets of the same work which were
supplied to the new members of the Thirty-
Ninth and Fortieth Congresses. It also pro-
poses to appropriate a sum sufficient to pay for
the same 5 the accounts for which are to be
certified by the Secretary of the Senate and the
Clerk of the House, or their attorneys, accord-
ing to the purchases made by them, respect-
ively, for the members of the Senate and the
House, and paid by the proper accounting
officers of the Treasury Department.
Mr. STEWART. I shall object to purchas-
ing any of those until the set of 1867 is cor-
rected. I do not want to buy any more of
those, because the leaves are very badly mis-
placed. I would not buy any more Globes to
have a mutilated set.
The VICEt PRESIDENT. The resolution
is reported without recommendation, aud will
be placed on the Calendar.

PORT OF DELIVERY AT KANSAS CI TV.
Mr. SCHURZ, I now move to take up
House bill No. 2160.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Calendar of
special orders is before the Senate, the morn-
ing business being concluded j and the Senator
from Missouri moves to postpone all prior
orders for the purpose of considering the bill
indicated by him.
Before putting the motion, the Chair desires
to state to the Senate that he will retire from
the duties of this position at the close of this
day's session, so that at the opening of to-
morrow's session the Senate can elect a Pres-
ident pro tempore to serve during the recess.
The question is on the motion of the Senator
from Missouri.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 2169) to establish
a port of delivery at Kansas City, Missouri.
It proposes to constitute the city of Kansas,
in the State of Missouri, a port of delivery,
anfiexed to and made a part of the collection
district of New Orleans, and to be subject to
the same regulations and restrictions as other
ports of delivery in the United States; and all
the privileges and facilities afforded by the act
of Congress of the 2d March, 1831, entitled
4'' An act allowing the duties on foreign mer-
chandise imported into Pittsburg, Wheeling,
Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, Nashville,
and Natchez to be secured and paid at those
places " are to be extended to that port. A
surveyor of customs is to be appointed to re-
side at the poit and perform the duties pre-
scribed by law, who i3 to receive the same
compensation now provided or which may
hereafter be provided by law for surveyors of
the same grade.
The bill Was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
i\E1V ORLEANS AND YICKSBURG UAILROAD.
Mr. KELLOGG. I now move to take up
Senate bill No. 804. 1 am sure there will be
no objection to it. The bill has passed the
Senate once before, and will take but a few
moments to read it, and I know there will be
no objection to it when it is read.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (S. No. 804) in aid of the
New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Vicksburg
railroad.

pensation.
Ssc. 8. Andbe it farther enacted, That this act shall
take effect from and after its psssage, and all laws

Mr. KELLOGG. I offer the following amend-
ment, to come in after line twenty-seven, at
the end of the first section; it is authorized
by the committee:
But in ease it shall appear that the United States
have, when thelineorrouteof saidroad isdefinitely
fixed, sold, granted, or reserved, any sections or parts
thereof granted as aforesaid, or that the right of
homestead or preemption has attached to the same,
other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu
thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior, lying within ten miles of the line of said
grant.
Mr. HARLAN. That is a provision which
the Senate would not permit to go on to a bill
that related' to an Iowa road. 1 know of no
reason why a preference should be given to a
road in Louisiana over one in Iowa.
Mr. KELLOGG. Twice this week the Sen-
ate, by a call of yeas and nays, have voted this
provision on two different bills. There is but
little public land granted on the line of this
road.
