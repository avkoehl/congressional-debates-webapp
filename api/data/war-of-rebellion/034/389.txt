his guides, I am chiefly indebted for the main success. His knowledge of the country is through and reliable, and was invaluable. All the officers and men deserve great credit and paries for the cheerfulness with which they submitted to great hardships and fatigue, and their energy and readiness at all times either to fight or march.

I inclose the parole of 461 prisoners.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. SANDERS.
