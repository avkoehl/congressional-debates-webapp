appear to be striking across to the left of him, aiming, I suppose, at the road mentioned in my previous dispatch. He does not say whether infantry or cavalry; I presume the latter.

The ford at which enemy are reported crossing is two miles above Huey's Mill; said to be good, and with good road to Lewisburg pike, near Rally Hill. I'll move everything there at once.

Hadn't the brigade ordered over river better be ordered to join me at once?

Major CAMPBELL:

MAJOR: Colonel Capton reports, 11.20 a. m., his force driven back from south side of Duck River by heavy force of the enemy; he is now fighting them across river. I move everything in that direction. Order Stewart's brigade, sent below the town, to join me by the road toward Rally Hill; he will, however, have to keep well to the north, as the force crossing above Huey's also seems heavy, from all I can learn. Maybe Stewart had better go pretty well up to Spring Hill before striking across.
