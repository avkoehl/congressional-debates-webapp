~tih Cong- ••2\d Stss.                             Increase of the Army—Mr. Browson._________________________________Ü. of Reps.
Committte, that the present military force as au-
thorized by law, is 7,958, including all the staff
departments, ind every person in any way attach-
ed to the milhtary establishment The bill which
has passed the Senate, and which we now have
under consideration, would give an mciease of
6,692, making the total 14,650 T' «, perhaps,
would not be too much, according to the e<- i jiates
of the best authorities, but the amendment  pro-
proposed to the Senate bill by the committee of
this House, reduce the number propostd bj the
Senate bill to be added to .5,689, which added to
the piesent number of the army, would give a total
of 11,647, but I am informed by the chairman of
the M litary Committee this morning, that that
committee have come to the conclusion to recom-
mend an additional regiment, and that an amend-
ment will be offered bj him from the Military
Committee to that effect, so that if this House
snail adopt the amendments proposed by their
Military Committee, the result will be as follows
Piesent force of the aimy - - - 7,958
Additions proposed by Military Committee, 3,689
One new regiment—80 privates lo a com-
pany, (say)   ------     940
Total                                      12,587
Making in all a force of 12,587, and although
this amendment does>not give as large a foi ce as   he
Senate bill >ei tor the reasons. whiJi I will hereai-
tei {,1  e  aLd which are principally founded on the
Le'iet   that  t^e amendments  as proposed by  tne
Hou e co nmit ee provide for a better arrangement
and orsam/ihon  of this force, and that the lesser
mimbei   may be rendered more efficient than the
h^ei number  proposed by the Senate bill, I pre-
fer 11^ imendr"ents of our  committee,  although I
im lot pre pi ed to say that the increase as pru-
p   " 1 I  the Senate bill, is too laige     But, sir, in
or i i to e urn ite  the  importance of an increase,
and to letermine wi h such accuracy nsne may
the exlent of that increase   it is necessary that *e
go mto an examination of the state of our frontiers,
that vi e look at the condition of the Union, and see
whether any and what causes exist, which render
this measure   necessary.    On this point,  I beg
leave to call the attention of this committee first to
the condition of the Wesfrn frontier, and when I
speak of that frontier, I mpan to include only the
western frontier proper—beginning at the mouth ot
the Sabine, and extending along the west bounds of
Aikansasand   Missouri and from thence to Fort
Snelhng on the upper Mississippi, near the falls of
St Anthon\     Along the whole line of this frontier
the savage tribes of the West are congregated, and
noi only those who  original'} inhabited ¡host  re-
gions, but -lso the various tribes which have been
removed ue'tuf the Mississippi    The removal of
the tribes from the east  side of the Mississippi, to
the ues , has been gradually going on  }ear alter
jetr, until there are now but lew left on this side
ol that river, excepting the Cherokees, whose re-
moval is now in progress, and a few in Wisconsin,
w th a remnant of the Seminóles in Florida    The
estimated number of Indian wrrnon now west of
the Mississippi, is upwards of 50,000,and when the
removals   now    in    progress   shall   have   b°en
completed,    there   will   be,    according    to     the
esti inies   of the   head  of   the    India!     depa t-
ment   about 66 000 warriors among all the In-
dians  west of that river, many of them, too, of
the  most fierce and warlike tribes that ever existed
in North America    This, sir, is a most portentous
c ngregation of savage force on our Western fron-
tlet,   a   force which, under any   circumstances,
would make it the duty of this Government to af-
lord astrong and powerful protection to our border
sealers, by means of regular troops   But when we
beai in mind the causes of disaffection which exist
among  those tubes, particularly those who have
been removed from this side of the Mississippi, we
cinnot Miut our eyes to the fact that the danger of
i speedy and most bloody Indian war, on that fron-
tier, is imminent in the extreme     Some of the In-
dnns wl o have  been removed, have gone peacea-
bly, and with kindly feelings towards our Govern-
mi nt, but with most of them such is not tht case
th«y ire brooding   oier  their  supposed  or  real
v, rongs and injuries, they have been forced across
the Mississippi against iheir Kill, although in pur-
suance of tieaties entered into by them     I say
agiinst their will, because, in most instances, when
the time has arrived for them to depart, under these
treaties, they have not been ready to go     But the
circumstances attending the '■emoval of these tribe. 
I will not advert to, further than to say that their
worst passions and prejudices have been  aroused,
and that the inherent, and  almost instinc'ive, ha-
tred of the white man, which ihey  possess, is in
creased, and they go to their new homes goaded
almost to desperation by their fancied wrongs, and
with their feelings of enmity and wrcn<?s whetted
and sharpened to a degree that forbids all idea of
peace on their part    Sir, there is, at this moment,
no sign of peace on that frontier, on the conliary,
he indications are of war—of murderous, swage
border wr    Scarcely a mail or a messenger ar-
rives from that region by which these indications
are not confirmed.    Haidly a breeze blows from
that quarter that does not bear on its wmgs the
rumors of a savage war    In truth, sir, if we are
to credit the reports, the war is already declared,
the tomahawk is dug up, the scalping knife is whet-
ted, and the war-whoop is sounded    Tht, ch ef^
and warriors of some of the tribes on the Arkai-
.jaw frontier, it is said, have already given notice to
the ofi cers of our trmy there that they intend to go
to war wiih us     They  make no concealment of
their designs     The question that they will fi"ht is
settled, and it only  remains to be  determined by
them when they   hill commence, and this point,
they say, is to be determined when they assemble
for their green-corn dance m July     Sir, every con-
sideration of mercy and  duty call   loudly for the
immediate and prompt display of more military
force on that frontier
And how is it with the Atlantic coa^t? From
the nortneast corner of Mame to the mouth of the
Sabine, or at least lo Florida, there are no troops,
or comparatively none Every fort ind every
military post on the whole Atlantic co.'st his been
stripped to carrj on the war in Florida, and 'o
garrison the Western posts There are hardly
men enough at any post on the w hole coast to fire
a salute Many of the posts are entirely aban-
doned, ard fortifications and other public works
are going rapidly to decay for the want of suffi-
cient men to keep them in repair MiUions have
been expended to construct these fortifications, and
unless men are provided to take care of them, dila-
pidation and deoay will render them wholly use-
less But, sir, I do not intend to dwell upon this
topic The impolicy of leaving our Atlantic coast
m such a defenceless and unprotected state must
be apparent, and as my colleague [Mr Kemble]
has already dwelt largeiy upon this point, I shall
leave it by merely calling the attention of this
committee to the language of the Secretary of War,
in his report, on the 5th March, 1838, wherein he
says, that " there is not a foi tress on our long line
of sea defences capable of resisting an armed
brig," that "the works are unfinished, unarmed,
and not even men enough to preserve them from
dilapidation, or protect them from plunder "
And then, sir, let us turn our attention to the
Maine border Is there no necessity for troops
there'' The exciting and hitherto unsettled ques-
tion in relation to the boundary line between Maine
and the British provinces wo ild seem to require
some for e on that frontier Great Britain has
already 5,000 troops along that line, or in the ad-
joining province. The question of the boundary
is still not only unsettled, but dail/ becoming more
troub'esome, and the feelings of the inhabitants on
both sides of the line becoming more excited I
would refer to the gentlemen from Maine on this
floor, and ask them whether they are willing that
that frontier snould be left n its piesent unpro-
tected state, whether they see no necessity of troops
upon that frontier
Next, Mr Chairman, I propose to call your
attention to the Northern and Northw estern fron-
tier—to the line separating the Union fiom Canada,
extending from the foot of Lake Superior down
through the Lakes and river St Latrence, ami
from thence easterly to the west hn  of ('••<■ "Vate of
Maine Along this whole frontier, coupn mg an
extent of nearly two thousand miles, ¡he whole
military force had been withdrawn previous to the
opening of the present year, with the exception,
perhaps, of a, very few troops at some of the post?
above Detroi;    1  admit, sir, that   the profound,
state of peace and quiet which reigned along that
whole border until withm the last few mouths,
might and did justify the withdrawal of the mili-
tary forces from that line when their services were
so imperiously required m Florida and elsewhere,
Thej were withdrawn,  and the fortifications, can-
tonments, and military establishments, along that
border, exhibit the. inevitable and speedy retult of
such a state of things    Dilapidation and decay,
and, in some instances, almost the uiter ruin and
destruction of such  works, has been the conse-
quence    In the mean  tune, the Bn'ish Govern-
ment has been busily engaged in rebuilding and
repairing thai military posts on the Canada side,
and, although in a state of profound peace, keep-
ing up a very considerable mili ary force    But
this has been a subject of no pa' icular alarm to
our citizens on that border    Conscious pf their
ow strength, as well as of the rectitude of they
conduct towards their Canadian neighbors—hardy
and brave, and prompt to repel aggression—ihejr
have entertained no fears, nor do they now enter-
tain any doubts, of their ability to protect them-
selves against any open hostilities from any quarter.
Moreover, the business and social relauoas between
the citizens on the different sides of the line were of
the most friendly character, their intercourse easy
and frequent, almost constant, so much so, that a
rupture of these friendly relations was hardly ima-
gined, much less expected   But a sodden change has
been wrought.   The torch of civil war has been
lighted in the Cañadas,  along the whole of this
frontier,and strong efforts have been made to invol ve
our own citizens, and, through inem, our country,
in these civil disturbances of a neighboring and
friendly power     The proximity ot our territory to
the Cañadas, and  the easy and frequent inter-
course? thereby afforded,andthe facility with which
those disaffee'ed to the present Government in the
Cañadas can communicate with our citizens, has
aided to produce a degree of sympathy, on the part
of some of our people, towards the Canadian pa-
triots, not by any means favorable to a strict ob-
servance of neutrality.   Vast numbers of the Ca-
nadian refugees, who have been duvea out of Ca-
nada duriBg the past winter, are scattered a!on$
the frontier, as it is believed, busily engaged in
enlisting the sympathies of our own citizens, and
exciting them to espouse their cause, and appeal-
ing (perhaps, in some instances, net in vain,) to
our citizens   to   redress   those   flagrant outrages
which were committed at Sehlosser, and others of a
similar but less atrocious character.    In the mean
time,  the frontier citizens on both sides have be-
come much  excited, offences, retaliatory in their
character, have been committed, and ao exaspera-
tion ol feeing prevails imminently dangerous to the
peace of the frontier, and   senouslj   threatening
our neutral relations.
Under these circumstances, the presence of Uni-
ted States troops on that frontier is deemed to be
indispensably necessary The military posts
shjuld be garrisoned, and effectual measures taken,
not only fot the due protection of the front'er and
our ow n citizens, but also to maintain our neutra-
lity, enforce our treaty st pulations, and to prevent
those disturbinces which are likely to occur m the
present posture of affairs
With this view, or to these ends, the inhabitants
from that region hat e called loudly for a regular
military force    And I have repeatedly, during the
winter, urged the Secretar} of War to send troops
to that frontier, and so hte as the 5th ¡nst after
the affair of the "Robert Peel," and m anwser to
my renewed request to send troops there, and to
in mquirj made by me of the Secretary, whether
a regiment could not be withdrawn from the Che-
rokee country, or Florida, I received an answer, a
copt. of which I ho'd m my hand, and from which
I beg leave to read the following extract
