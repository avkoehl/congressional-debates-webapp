Colonel SHAFFER,Chief of Staff:

An officer from Admiral Lee is here and reports that a cavalry force with some artillery was seen between Deep Bottom and Malvern Hill yesterday afternoon. They had a number of wagons with them. Do you know whether this force belongs to us or the enemy? The gunboats shelled them yesterday. Sharp musketry firing was heard near Deep Bottom or in a northeasterly direction from there.

Your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

JUNE 14, 1864.

Major General Q. A. GILLMORE:

We have no knowledge whether it is our force or not. Our cavalry is out in that direction, but what you allude to is probably from the description the enemy's.
