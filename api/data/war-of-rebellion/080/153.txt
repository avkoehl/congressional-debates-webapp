Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that General Burnside reports the enemy's line in his front abandoned, and the prisoners taken say that there is no second line. The commanding general may call on you to move forward at any moment, and wishes you to have your troops well up to the front, prepared to move. Do the enemy's lines in front of Mott's division appear to be thinly occupied, and is there any chance to push forward there?

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS.

July 30, 1864-6 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

It is not possible to say about the line in front of General Mott, as both parties keep down, firing whenever a head is shown. General Ord left word for me with General Mott that there was no place to assault here, as the line was not only protected by abatis but by wire. This was the decision of himself and his division commanders, and he requested General Mott so to inform me. I know nothing more about it. I will be prepared for your orders.

W. S. HANCOCK.
