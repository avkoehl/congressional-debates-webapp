General Hindman takes command, and calls for the conscripts between the ages eighteen and thirty-five.

Corinth being evacuated, I called on General Halleck for immediate aid to check this rebel inspiration, which is operating on all sides of me and has pressed back General Osterhaus and Carr from Little Red to White River. General Halleck has responded by drawing on you. Nothing more except ordinary gunboats up White River. Hence my only chance is to look for your action.

I have scraped up a cavalry and howitzer force to check a movement of the enemy on this side of Little Red River near Clinton. I feel anxious about it, as the enemy are in much larger numbers.
