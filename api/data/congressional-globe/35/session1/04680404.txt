THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 26,
The SPEAKER. That is immaterial. I
Mr JEWETT. I presented an amendment!
before the call for the previous question. i
The SPEAKER. The Chair could not enter- j
tain the amendment of the gentleman from Ken- \
tucky, for the reason that the proposition then '
pending was a proposition to suspend the rules ,
to enable the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Stanton] :
to introduce his resolution. 1
Mr. HUGHES, (at a quarter to five, p. m.) I
move that the House do now adjourn; and 011 that
motion I call for the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were not ordered, only ten
members voting therefor.
The question was then taken, and the motion
was not agreed to; there being, on a division,
ayes 17, noes J01.
Mr. HUGHES. I rise to a question of order.
I wish to put an inquiry to the Chair. When the
resolution of the gentleman from Ohio was first
read, I rose to my feet and announced that I de-
sired to offer an amendment, which I immediately
sent to the Glerk's desk, before the motion to sus-
pend the rules was made; and I wish to know of
the Chair if that amendment came too late ?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman was not in
order m moving his amendment; first, because j
"the rules had not been suspended to permit the J
gentleman from Ohio to introduce his resolution;
and, second, because, so soon as the rules were j
suspended, the floor, according to universal par-
liamentary courtesy and propriety, was assigned
to the gentleman from Ohio, who demanded the
previous question; so that the gentleman from In-
diana [Mr. Hughes] has not had an opportunity
of presenting his amendment in such form as that
it could be recognized by the Chair.
Mr. HUGHES, i appeal to the House to vote
down the previous question.
Mr. FLORENCE. I ask the gentleman from
Ohio what the usual compensation to a stenogra-
pher is ?
Mr. STANTON. I will answer the gentleman
with gr?at pleasure. I understand he is paid by
the folio; so that the pay depends upon the amount
of work. It is impossible to say what the amount
would be.
Mr. FLORENCE. That was tho only diffi- '
culty with me. I do not know what the usual
compensation is. How much is it a folio ?
Mr. HUGHES, (at ten minutes to five o'clock,
p. m.) I move that the House do now adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to; there being, on
a division, ayes 29, noes 105.
The question recurred on the call for the pre-
vious question.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine, demanded tell-
ers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Bocock and
Chaffee were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reportedâ€”
ayes 102, noes 15.
The Speaker voted in the affirmative.
So the previous question was seconded.
Mr. BOCOCK. If the House adjourn now,
does not tho question come up to-morrow morn-
ing the first thing?
The SPEAKER. Yes.
Mr. BOCOCK. Then I move that the House
do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and thereupon (at
live o'clock, p. m.) the House adjourned till to-
morrow at twelve o'clock, m.
