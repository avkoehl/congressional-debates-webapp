that on coming to the House this morning, he
found that he had been appomted a ^member of
the select committee raised under the resolution
of yesterday He now begged leave to be exctred
from serving on that committee, for the reason that
the State of Missouri had but few members on this
floor, and he had a great deal of business to attend
to, which he feared he would not be able to do
justice to if he were to remain on this committee
and attend to the investigation which was expected
to take place

NEUTRALITY  BILL
Mr HOWARD then reported back the " Neu-
rality bill," which was read twice
On motion of Mr BRONSON, the bill was read
at length
Mr HOWARD moved that it be made the spe-
cial order for the morning hour of to-moirow Mr
H added that he did not think the House ought to
postpone the consideration of this bill for a single
day or hour longer than was necessary for a full
understanding of its provisions He si ncerely hoped,
and believed, too, that it had been so framed, from
gathenng up the suggestions and opinion, of mem-
bers of all sides, that it would be acceptable to the
House
Mr JOHNSON of Mar} land objected, on the
ground that it would set aside his resolution which
had been partly discussed
Mr CAMBRELENG suggested that it would be
better to let the bill remain wheie it was, and rill
it up in the morning

cial order for to-morrow, from 1 to 2 o'clock,
which, after some remarks from Mr   BRONSON
on the urgent necessity of passing some measuie,
was agreed to

BANK OF THE UNITED STATES
On motion of Mr THOMAS, the orders of the
day were postponed, and the House took up the
Senate bill " to prevent the abatement of suits and
actions now pending, in which the late Bank of the
United States may be a party "
Mr THOMAS said that as he saw no other
mode of meeting his object, than by moving the
previous question on this bill, he, therefore,
moved the previpus question
Mr ADAMS hoped the previous question would
not be now sustained, so as to deprive us of the
opportunity of saying whether it was constitutional
or not to establish a Bank of the United States
The previous question was then seconded, and
the mam question ordeied, and the bill was read a
third time, and passed
Mr CAMBRELENG then mo; ed to postpone
the order  of the day until this day v. eek, for the
purpose of proceeding with the appropriation bills,
which motion wai agreed to
The House then took up the "bill making ap-
propriations for Revolutionary and othei pension-
ers for the)ear 1S38 "
The question pending was on the engiossment
of the bill
Mr CAMBRELENG said, when this bill wis
last under consideration, his colleague (Mr Curtis)
had made charges with respect to certain pensnn
agents having the use of the public moneys for six
months, as a compensation for their services, and
since that time, he had seen a veiy full report, in a
New York paper, of what had been said on that
occasion, together with much that had not been
said Now, so far as this charge was concerned,
he acquitted his colleague, because the same charge
had been made two days before by a Senator m his
speech
The CHAIR reminded the gentleman that it was
not m order to allude to remarks made by a Se-
nator
Mr CAMBRELENG then proceeded In con-
sequence of this charge he had called at the War
Department, and had obtained communications
from the Commissioner of Pensions and the Secre-
tary of War, which set this whole matter right
The state oí the case was, that out of fifty of these
igents, foity of them were banks, and the moneys
there deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of the
United States, as well as the disbursing officer, were
discounted upon m the same manner in which the
banks discounted upon other moneys deposited
w ith them
Mr C then sent the communications to the
Chair to be read, together with communications
from some oí the pension agents, asking of the
commissioner to furnish them with more money,
as some of the pensioners had not been paid since
September last, m consequence of the want of
funds
Mr CURTIS reiterated the statement he had
before made, and said that if he had fallen into
error in relation to it, that he was not accountable
for the error, as he nad come to his conclusions
fiom the reports made from the Departments, and
laid upon the tables He had made application to
the War Department m relation to this mattei, and
had received for answer that it was not usual to
answer communications unless made by a resolu-
tion of the House, and thus he had been prevente!
from getting that information which he desired
He had reason to believe, however, that there was
always balances m the hands of these pension
agents of some million and a half of dollars,     Mr
C then went into an examination of the documents
of the House, with a view ot showing that he had
made his statement on good data
Mr C \MBRELENG replied to his colleague
(Mr Curtis) with regard to the course pursued by
the War Department. The charge, as he under-
stood it, was that the pension agents had ihe use of
the money placed in their hands This he denied
The money in banks was used as other moneys
placed m banks, but it was not used by individual
agents The Department lately, he stated, had
pursued a different course with regard to the secu-
rity to be received for money placed m banks from
that which it puisued formerly
In consequence of this, and in consequence of
reqmnrg secuuty for all the money placed m these
banks by the Department, the funds in the Com
monwealth Bank of Boston were saved With
regard to the stateme it which the gentleman had
referred to, he had only to say that he did not won-
der that his colleague had fallen into enor with
respect to it, because he (Mr C ) himself had
tallen into enor on some occasion with respect to
these statements He had, however, obtained ano-
ther statement from the Department, which showed
the exact balances in the hands of these agents,
and he laid it before the House, when it was read
at the Clerk's tibie
Mr CURTIS madt a few remarks in reply, con-
tending that these moneys deposited in banks to the
credit of the<¡e agents, were subject to be drawn out
by then% and applied to their own private uses, the
Department having no control over them, and this
was the abuse he wished to see corrected
Mr BELL contended that it was the duty of the
House to examine into this matter, and see that
these moneys were properly expended, and ascer-
tain that there was no improper practices connect-
ed with the piesent system of paying pensioners
He did net desire to delay the payment of the old
pensioners oí the United States, but he desired to
correct abuses, if any existed, and he trusted the
members of the Hou e would take the responsi-
bility of examining into this matter thoroughly
The debate was further continued by Messrs
ATHERTON, SIBLEY, MALLORY, CURTIS,
REED, CAMBRELENG, PHILLIPS, BELL,
JENIFER, McKIM, and MORGAN
On motion of Mr LAWLER,
The House then adjourned
IN SENATE,
Thxrsda\, March 1, 1838
Mr McKEAN said he had íeceived, and would
present to the Senate, a memorial numerously
signed by citizens of the borough and county of
Erie, in the fetate oí Pennsylvania, complaining
that the medical board appointed under authority
of the act of the 3d of March last, by the President
of the United States to «elect suitable sites for ma-
rine hospitals on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers
and Lake Erie, for the benefit ol sick and disabled
seamen, boatmen, and other navigators on the
western rivers and lakts, have, in discharging that
duty, confined their examination exclusively to
one or two places on Lake Eue , while the claims
of all other places, mant of them containing in a
high degree all the requisites for such an estaolish-
ment, have been overlooked and neglected, and
praying Congies-  to order a new exaimiation by a
compe ent, impartial, and unprejudiced board
Mr McK said he coull not fail to be stiuek with
the similarity bets een this and toe Pittsburg case,
which he had the honoi to present a few days
since Poo) Pennsylvania' the Key stone, in this, as
in many other cases reminded him of the account
given of one of old, who fell among thieves, and
«as shunned and passed by on ei'her ,ide He
could not but feel and express his astonishment
and regret that two points so noted and important
as Pittsburg and Erie should have been thus wan-
tonly neglected He moved to refer the memori?l
to the Committee on Commeice, and hop d that
justice would be done   referred accordingly
Mr WALKER presented the memorial of the
Legislature oí Mississippi, praying for an increase
of compensation for jurors in the courts of the
United States, in that State leferted to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary
