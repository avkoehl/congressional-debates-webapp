HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, July 2, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have only three days' supplies, including a train not yet in. I send a train to-day which can bring three days' more if they are at the depot. Possibly I may be able to make this last until the 10th. If you think this sufficient, I can get everything away from the railroad some time to-night. Some of my sick must go back to-day. I am not informed whether they can get railroad transportation to-night.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, July 2, 1864-12.50 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The enemy is extremely quiet in my front and shows only a light skirmish line. At 10 o'clock Stoneman had possession of the bridge at Sweet Water Town and of the west bank of the creek as far down as the Factory with a force moving toward Campbellton. He was repairing the bridge and would push out on all roads to the north and east as soon as his horses could be got across. Stoneman has met no enemy except small parties. He thinks the main body of Jones' and Wheeler's cavalry is near Campbellton. His scouts just returned so report.

I have not heard from Stoneman since 10 a.m. Expect full report from him to-night, and will send it to yo as soon as received. In his dispatch he says: "There is a ferry at Campbellton and one a few miles above." Also "a bridge at Franklin, sixty miles below Atlanta." He does not give the source of his information.
