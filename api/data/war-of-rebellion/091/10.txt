In case they do this, follow them up closely with your advance guard. in case they should make, any attempt to cross the river let me know immediately; be sure and keep me constantly posted. The cavalry force up the Valley under General Torbert has as yet obtained no information whatever in regard to the enemy's movements.

Have the stragglers been forwarded yet from Cumberland to Harper's Ferry? If not, send them at once, as they are useless to you while unarmed. They can be armed at the Ferry.
