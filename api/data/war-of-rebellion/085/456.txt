GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel STAUBER,

Sturgeon:

Give me full particulars of the disaster to Major Johnston. Do you hear from Draper, Douglass, or Major King, and what news from the guerrillas? I have requested arms to be sent from Saint Louis.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

STURGEON, September 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Just from Centralia. The Thirty-ninth [Missouri] lost 130 killed, 3 wounded. Major Johnston, Captain Smith, two lieutenants, and all non-commissioned officers escaped. Two mule teams shot and the wagons burned. All the men but one were shot in the head; numbers were bayoneted; others had their heads mashed with the butts of their own guns. Colonel Draper is at Centralia; will remain there until he hears from General Douglass or Major King. The enemy was at Mount Zion Church this morning. Colonel Draper thinks he is a little east of south from this post. I hold an engine here to communicate with Colonel Draper if necessary.

T. J. STAUBER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

GLASGOW, September 28, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,

Centralia (Sturgeon):

I am greatly pained by the disaster at Centralia. The country will expect us to make reparation of this serious damage. General Rosecrans ia anxiously waiting to hear of severe blow upon these fiends. I trust he will not be disappointed. I am yet without an intelligent account of the affair between Major Johnston and the guerrillas. Give it to me as early as possible. Colonel Kutzner is marching across the country from Shelbina, via Paris, to Glasgow. I very much want the howitzer that Major King has with him, to place on a steamer for a river patrol. Get word to Major King that he may order the howitzer into Colonel Kutzner's command as it comes this way. I fear General Douglass stopped at Columbia and will let the guerrillas scatter and float back this way. I have ordered ammunition to Mexico. Infuse enterprise into the entire command and give us a sweeping victory over the villains.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

STURGEON, September 28, 1864.

General FISK:

Just arrived here from Renick with Major Leonard. He has 125 men; I have 175. Colonel Stauber has sent a message to Major King informing him of the whereabouts of the guerrillas. General Douglass, with the [First] Iowa, 150 strong, is moving toward Centralia. If I can hear from you in an hour, I will wait any information or orders from you; otherwise I will move on down the road.

DAN. M. DRAPER,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
