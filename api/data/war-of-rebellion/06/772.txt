have suffered, and the commander is by no means as courteous and amiable as he was after the infliction on his outside confrere, Colonel Wilson. My lookouts report that escorts to their grave-yard, which is immediately under our glasses, are very frequent, and that two officers certainly have been buried. Yesterday a small boat attempted to enter the harbor from the fleet-a privilege heretofore accorded them, as our steamers were allowed to run freely tot he yard. We fired on it, when the crew precipitately abandoned it and swam ashore, leaving the boat to float off. Some of our shots went very near the fort, but they declined the invitation. We infer they are satisfied. One of their ships (the Hartford) was towed off yesterday by a gunboat, thus proving her disability. Some operation is going on by them far up Santa Rosa Island, but what we cannot exactly conjuncture. An expedition leaves to-day to ascertain.

Captain Thom's company of Marines, 100 men, leaved to-day for Virginia, by request of the Secretary of the Navy. This is the third draft made on me, and while it gives me great pleasure to discipline and instruct his men, and while it gives me great pleasure to discipline and instruct his men, the Secretary must excuse me for declining any longer to furnish him arms, &amp;c. It is depleting process I cannot stand.

As early as last spring and frequently since I have asked for some young navy officers, but without success. I have two steam gunboats commanded by landsmen. A rifled ship gun promised for one of them some weeks ago is not yet heard from. These points are of importance.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
