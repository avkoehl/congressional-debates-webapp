PRESIDENT OF THE CONGRESS:

SIR: I herewith transmit to the Congress a communication from the Secretary of War recommending a certain appropriation therein mentioned.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., January 10, 1862.

The PRESIDENT:

SIR: During the past summer Major-General Polk found it necessary, on some emergencies, to borrow money temporarily from the banks in Tennessee, amonting in all to $390,000. These sums, advanced to quartermaters, have been repaid out of the regular appropriations; but General Polk agreed to pay interest, and as this was without authority of law I have of course been without power to make the payment. The total amount borrowed is shown by Statement A, inclosed and the interest due is shown by Statement B, and amounts to $6,466.43. As this money was advanced for the pruposes of public defense, at a time when mechanical embarrassments in the engraving and preparation of Treasury notes prevented the prompt supply of funds necessary for the support of the Army, I beg respectfully that you transmit to Congress this recommendation for an appropriation of $6,466.43, to be applied to the payment of said interest.*

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
