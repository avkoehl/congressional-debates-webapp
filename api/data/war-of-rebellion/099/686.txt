HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Cheraw, S. C., March 5, 1865.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: Two deserters from the enemy came in to-day and gave themselves up to First Division, Fifteenth Army Corps. They report that their command has gone to Charlotte. Captain Duncan, who is scouting toward Rockingham, also reports that a column moved in the direction of Charlotte. He found six caissons which the enemy had abandoned. These are in addition to those I told you of to-day.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: In conversation with a citizen this evening he accidentally let drop the information that Joe Johnston is generally expected to be marching parallel with us, and was expected at Wadesborough before this with the force at Charlotte. Hardee doubtless thinks he will form a junction with him at or near Rockinghma. This, taken in connection with deserters's report that they (the rebels) mean yet to resist us between this point and Fayetteville, makes me think that some such thing may be Johnston's design, taking the offensive, particularly if he can isolate a corps. I think he is too late.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

The attention of officers and soldiers of this army is called to the gross and criminal practice of profane swearing which prevails and is increasing amongst us, so much so that every sense of good principle and good taste is outraged. Have we forgotten that God is our kind Father and that God is our kind Father and that He is helping us? Every insult to Him is a scourge to ourselves and invites disaster to our noble cause.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:
