GENERAL: General Gibbon reports that the enemy are and have been passing to our right as seen from his front. They may be massing in front of General Barlow or yourself. The major-general commanding directs me to say, therefore, that you had better be very vigilant and use reconnaissances and preparations.

Major-General MEADE:

I sent out instructions from here to push forward my skirmish line at 7 a. m. I have no reports as yet. I shall move my headquarters out on the road from Linney's to Mechanicsville as far along it as the operations of the day will permit.

Major-General MEADE:

General Bartlett on my right reports his left as near the enemy's works as he was at Spotsylvania Court-House. He will push his right out. The enemy endeavored to take his pits last evening but failed.

From my present right to Cold Harbor, connect with General Wright, will be nearly a line of battle 5 miles. If we can get possession of the direct road from Bethesda Church to Cold Harbor, I do not propose to connect with him by more than a skirmish line at first.

G. K. WARREN,
