dividuals—take it away from the suggestions of in-
* dividual avance—and you at once eradicate the
fruitful cans  of all our former failures In this
charter, ihe fact that the nan >n is to own one-third
of the capital can make no possible d fferenee
Just as sure a«¡ two-thirds are more than one-third,
just so sure will individual avarice govern the in-
itiation, and canse it to run the same profligate
career with its great prototype, and perish, like it,
amid the stench and rottenness of oar own corrnp
Hon.
Mr. Chairman, I must tafee time here to mer-
tion another objection which I have to this Bank,
as well as to all others owned by individuals, and
conducted by them for their own benefit I regard
banking, or the making of paper money, as the
most enormous speculation of modern times. I al
lude not «¡imply-to ihe rate of in erest, but to all
the advantages, direct and collateral, which those
enjoy who have ready access to the funds, and
who have control over the banks,. These enor-
mous profits, accumulating in ihe coffers of mdi
Vlduals, introduce a pioud and bloated aristocracy
in our land, and thereby deitroy that plain Re-
publican equsfaty* of rights and of fortune which
1 have ardently desired might be long preserved
m our country. I would join in no crusade
against the wealth which may be acquired by ho-
nest mduitry and sagacious enterprise; but I will
forever protest against ihose special privileges
which give to one favored class exclusive advan-
tages over all others, and which must ntrodnce
into our young and rising country all the aris-
tocratic disunctions of the old world Other objec-
tions exist to individual or joint-Mock banking,
which do not fall within the range of the pre ent
debate, and which time will not allow me to enu-
merate. Repudia ing as I have done, all mdwi
dual and jomt-s'ock bank ng as b¿snkt> of issues,
there remain only two oiher modes ot making fa
per money in lb s country. These are, either by
the nation in the aggregate,or by Ihe several S ates
of the Union, excluding ludividuaH from ,\ll parti-
cipation whatsoever Neuh-r of these forms of
banking is now before us, and the few precious
moment  of the brief hour which your rule allows,
will not admit of their discu sion. I leave them,
therefore, with this declaration—that 1 reject every
plan of banking by the General Government, and
infinitely prefer seeing a paper currency emana'ing,
if at all, from the respective States of the Union—
not from corporaiions ot individuals created by
them, bat from banks owned exclusively by the
States—governed by ihem—and all ti e profits mad •
by them received and enjoyed by all iht> peop e of
the States As a member oi Congress, t hive no
thmj lo i-^y or do for or agiiist such a «vstrm of
banking b/ the State ; the qu stion belongs pxclu
sively to them elees, but, as an American c tizen, I
am free to deel >re that, of all the different mides
of banking whirh have be<n heretofore tried or
proposed, I prefer <ucb a system by the S ate* as I
have mentioned Bat I return from this digression
to farther obj-c'ions to this bid.
The creatun of this corporation is the intro-
duction of a new power into our form of govern
ment, more potent t ian any other known to the
Constitution    The leg slauve, judicial, and execa
Uve departments, constitute the three great powers
of the Gotwnment     Bjt hne ii a power moie
potent than any—I had almost said than a 1 of
them put together    Neither ihe Executive nor J a
dietary can directly reach one in ten thousand of
our population    In reference to currency, the Le-
gislature only is authorized t®  roiu and repúlate
the value of gold anl silver, which tbe industry of
individuals has dag out of Ihe ear h orprtenred
in the course of lawful comm*rce     But heie i> a
power that can make and circula t a currency many
times greater in annum than all ihe gold and sil
ver on this comment     By dot gs>, itiey  are ei
abled to take the real money of the country out of
circulation, lock it up, and subs ¡ta e their own ma-
nufacture for it, and thus bring the r powers to bear
upon almou every inri vidual of our seventeen mil-
lions of population    Thisneu) artificial person ttak
mg and then wielding the capital of a whole conti-
nent, regulates and controls the value of all the pro-
perty, real and personal, and of all the labor, me-
chanical, agricultural, and commercial, of a mighty
people It is made ¡o re guíate (he currency, that i«,
to set up and pull down other institution?, to
make money plenty or caree, to make property
high or bw, according its own good pleasure On
every discount day, rune men are to assemb'e in
this city, en whose flat hang the fortunes snd des-
tinies of this whole people They send forth their
h gh command-, East, West, Nt rtb, and South, to
their subordinates in the branche ; and in twenty
days a whole continent lies prostrate at their bid
ding. The friends of this bill tell us that these or-
ders may go forth bearing the blessing? of ptospe
nty acd plenty on their wings If this be true, is
it not necessarily true, also, that thi y may be laden
with curses—with blight, and mildew, and death,
to the hopes and business of the country? A pow-
er so migrate ei'her for evil or for good, is now to
be spruns ift existence, and no other power is to
nay, or check, or control its tremendous action,
for twenty years to come
I pause, to demand if the people of this coun'ry
would be willing to confer so great a power even
on the Executive of iheir own choice? W< u'd
I hey bestow it on any nine members within these
walls? or on any nine men who ever lived in this coun-
try, however illustrious their names or eminent
their services? If th°y would not, can they be
willing that a number of capitalists—living at
great distances fiom tbern, and who never had
any sympathy with them in their wants, their suf-
ferings, and their labors, shall get toge her and
appoint nine agents—for themselves, not for the
country—for their own benefit, not that of the peo-
pl°—to regulate the currency, which is to control
the price ot all the property and all the labor of the
country? Sir, it cannot beso It canno'be that
thi American people, so j a ou^ of th ir nght , are
prepared to surrender ih*m toa mercenary olí
garchy—the mor  odio is, beense owing no re-
sponsibility to the people « horn they {lrmt'er and
destroy Sir, if it be the duty of Ooni rrss to re
guíate the ct rene;, («-Inch I dmy,) 'et Congress
do so t'self, by its own officers, appointed by an 1
respomiole to them, as they in ibeir turn are re-
sporsible to the people, but do not, I pray yon,
make an assignment of jour dit'es to this avan-
cous, menenary, souless corporation, which will
have its high inte.est and laige d vidend* al^oagh

and degrading parlner-hip like ihi , induces me
to rep il the imp'oration, that, if it h^ mm duty

agency and partnership of th s corporation.
What necessity i-, ther , let me ask, for thi
am zin * and dangerous deegm a <f piwei? is
it the too great scarcity of to d pnd & l?cr to meet
tke d'mnnds of the growing com rece of this

it to make paper money more abu d¡nt? Why, sir,
that is ta" vtry d si ase of which t!> s cruntry has
been dune f >r year1' Tne excessive paper lssu 
of 1834, '35, anl '36 are known to have produced
the revulsion of lt*37 The vene t quae'es and
impovors nía admit this The proces-, of dimi
nuhon has been going on r-ver sine 1837 with
slow anl pa rful bat inv duable succe s It w?s
fie universal prescription for the diseas-, t lat we
should lessen the amount of paper, and brina it
down to a fair and reasonable proportion to the rr -
eieus metals We haie followed th^t prescription,
until the country is evidently emergin  from that
state of indebtedness induced by extravagance and
speculation, from which at one period we awfully
feared it never could be rescued. Bat, after all,
and in spi'e of all, we have rode out the storm,
we have neared the port; we have gained sight of
the Und And shall we be agun thrown back on
the same wide ocean of paper money, from which
we vainly hoped soon to be rescued? Look to the
hundreds of millions of paper money now in cir-
culation, then look to the beggarly amount of spe-
cie provided for its redemption, and say if there be
not gross quackery, if not something worse, in the
present proposi'ion to increase the amount some
sixty or seventy mill ons. L"t me employ another
illustration of our present condition We liave
bean for years drunnen by extravagance and ex-
cess in every 'hmg, and now that the care of sin-
cere and laid friends has, nearly restored us from
the vile debauch, one of our old bottle companions
intrudes his pre cription upon us, and insistí  that
we shall run the same round of guilty dissipation
a before And, sir, it is astonishing to see with
what ready and even eager willingness ihe infatu-
ated piuent, breaking away from the cuslody of
his best friends, wdl follow the c unsels of those
who will but delude and destioy him
But, Mr Chairman, I turn away from th s
Bank as the means of relief to the people, and as
an institution to regúlete the currency and general
business of the country I wish now to c< nsider it
as "the Fiscal Bank of the United States"—a Bank,
as its name imports, necessary anrl proper for the
Government, in some way or oibír, in the collec-
ti n, safekeeping, and disbursements of the public
revenue
The eighth section of the first article of the Con-
stitution is an enume-ation of the powers of "Con-
gress, amongst which, that of collecting taxes,
dutes, lmpco's, ¿lid excises, is one of them At
the cío e cf re, same «ectn n, it is declared that
' Congress mty nwite all laws nece saiy and pro-
per ioi cairying into execution the for< gmng pow-
er?, and «11 "¡her powers vested by this Constitu-
tion in the Government of the United SUte°, or in
any depar ment or officer thereof" This is the
congenial «pot on whiih the Bank has eier de-
lighted to locate itself The false pretence that it is
necessary to the Government in the collection of its
taxes and dut es i  sei/ed up in to give it exisfnc;
wh 1st in tru h ai d in fact it is sule'y mlended ftr
the benefit of the commercial bu mess of th? coun-
try, and to subserve th ínte-ists ( f slock jobbrr'-,
specuia'orsf%ind all other who live b, ihur wit ,
instead ot >b<" h< n"sf labor of th ir hands 1 repeat
that it is a J¡ht pretence, for the eipenmenf his
bren row rip atei—which was fitst made in the
ea 'itct a id purest days ol he republic—of colkct-
tns, keeping, and disburs'ng the pu'he revenue,
nithmt the ajercy of any bank whoever,— an
exper ment wh ch Wa«hington first adipted;
w ueh Jefferson subsequently recommended should
be again adop ed; tnd which Ju^ge Wh'te main-
tained to bj entirely practicable, and wh ch Mr.
B°ll dechred could do nj g 'at good or harm to
any of tbe great interests ot 'his country Tbat
experiment has b°en actually tried, us ed, proved,
for more nan one entire year, with eminent and
comple'e suece^ The much abue#d Sub Trea-
suty has demonstrated thtt a bsnk %s not necessa y
to carry on ihe finansial cone rns ot th s nation.
Al bou h coudtm ied, as th" President says it has
been, it letres full cf h>rir, cairjing with it a
proui justifi-ation rf its fu nds, and cas'ng back
upi n its enemies a triumphant refutation of all their
predict nsofisentr   ftilure
But, Mr Chairman, n ttv n the pi e'ence of such
a ncces lty is su t-iired by th" provisions of this
bill Ihe birk io not to be rhaaed wiih hedn'y
