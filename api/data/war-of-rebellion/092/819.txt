HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,FIRST SEPARATE BRIGADE,

Morris Island, S. C., December 26, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. G. BENNETT,

Commanding Post, Morris Island, S. C.:

COLONEL: The brigadier-General commanding directs that you cause dry brush to be piled in front of the forts and batteries on this island where the ground admits, at a distance of from 200 to 300 yards, and at those points where it might be supposed that the enemy would make an attack. This is intended, in the latter case, to be fired, so as to throw a strong light on the space in front, thus enabling the garrison of the works to see the enemy.

I have the honor to be, Colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DICKINSON,

Captain, 21st U. S. Colored Troops, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Savannah, December 26, 1864.

Brigadier General R. SAXTON,

Commanding District of Beaufort, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the General-in-chief to acknowledge your communication to him under date of 22nd instant, and to express his appreciation of your readiness to aid him in respect to the disposition of the contrabands. He regards your suggestions as to the islands you mention as well worthily of consideration, especially with reference to the women and children. For the able-bodied men, General Easton, chief quartermaster, to whom the subject is referred, seems to think he can find employment for most, if not all, of them, and Lieutenant-General Grant has also signified his wish that a number shall be sent to him, including a due proportion of women and children. the general would be pleased to see you here to confer with himself and General Easton on the subject.

I am, General, respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY HITCHCOCK,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
