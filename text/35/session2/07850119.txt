The Tariff—Mr. Scales.
Ho. of Reps.
of 1846, they amounted to $150,637,464; for 1844,
second year of the tariff of 1842, they amounted
to §99,715,179; for the year 1848, second of 1846,
#132,904,121; for 1845, to §99,299,776; for 1849,
$132,666,955; for the year 1846, to $102,141,893;
and for 1850, $136,946,912.
Thus, while it will be seen that there was a
very large increase for every year of the tariff of
1846 over that of 1842, it will be also seen that
between the last year of the tariff of 1842 and
the first of the tariff of 1846, which was the year
following, the diffex-ence in favor of the latter was
the large sum in a single year of upwards of
forty-eight million dollars The importations
during the same time were in a corresponding
ratio, with a balance of trade in our favor. Then
if we take 1856, the last year of the tariff of 1846,
we find thatourexportshad reached the enormous
sum of $310,586,330; our imports, $314,639,942;
of this amount there was reexported and not con-
sumed $16,378,578, leaving a balarc$ of trade in
our favor of over $12,000,000. Again, sir, the
receipts from customs for the same years:
Receipts from Customs.
Tariff of 1842.
To June 30, 1843 $7,04618 J3 91
" 1844 26,H?3i57.i 04
" 1845 27.598,112 70
" 1846 26/712,667 87
Tariff of 1846.
To June 30, 1847 $23,747,864 66
" 1848 31,737,070 96
" 1849 28.346,738 82
" 1850   39,668,686 42
And then again, in 1856, the last year of the
tariff of 3846, the receipts from customs were
#64,022,863 50; and all this increase under the
tariff of 1846.
Now, sir, for the manufactures. The domestic
manufactures of cotton exported in the following
years were as follows:
184 3 £3,223,5:>0 1847 $<1,082,523
3844  2,898,780 1848  5,718,205
1845   4.327/J28 1849  4,933,129
184 6  3,545,481 1850  4,734,424
Showing that tho manufacturers of cotton have
not only been sustained, but have actually ex-
ported a large amount of their products, which
they have asked to have protected here, bringing
them in competition with similar fabrics of other
nations, without protection,and that these exports
have largely increased during the tariff of1846 over
what they were during the tariff of 1842, when
they had high protection.
Let us again try it as to iron, which is now the
principal article clamoring for protection:
Exports of domestic iron.
J 843 $539,693 1847 $1,167,484
1844   716,332 1848  1,259,632
1845   845,017 1849  1,096,172
184 6 1,151,7S2 1850  1,011,ISO
Again, sir, the total manufactures of pig iron,
iron castings, and wrought iron, and manufac-
tures of wrought iron, were, in the year 1840,
$29,909,1G2; in 1850, #60,485,653, an incrcasrof
over$30,000,000in ten years; and in the year 1855,
$78,406,538, an increase of nearly $18,000,000 in
five years. And yet, sir, we are to be told that,
without the bounty and protection of the Govern-
ment, the iron interest cannot survive.
Having learned thus much with regard to the
past, let us still further consider some of the ob-
jections, which, to me, sir,aieinsuperableagainst
the propriety of again resorting to protection for
the sake of piotectiun. As I have already inti-
mated, this system demands of the Government
a bounty or premium for the support of the pro-
tected classes, which, as I humbly conceive, is
in diiect violation of the spirit of the Constitu-
tion, and totally at war with the great objects for
which the Federal Union was established. If we
can levy an indirect tax for any such purpose,
without regard to the revenues which may be ne-
cessary to support the Government, why, then,
may we not take the revenues thus collectcd, and
distribute them among all cla&ses of our citizens
in specific sums, and for any specified object; and
if we can do this, why may we not go a stop
further, and lay direct taxes upon the people, in
order that we may have the privilege of scatter-
ing it promiscuously among them, or of paying
over to such as we may deem most meritorious.
Now, sir, I take it that no man can be found
who will dare assert that Congress has the power
to use the revenues, whether collected by direct
taxation or by imposts, for any such purpose.
Where, then, is the distinction? In what does
it consist ? It is true that the bounty, or premium,
secured to the manufacturers does not go into the
Treasury*, but it is, nevertheless, paid, and must
operate as a tax upon the consumer. To afford
this protection, the importations of foreign goods
are prohibited, except at a duty that will so en-
hance the price of the foreign article as not only
to enable the home manufacture to compete with
it, but to realize therefrom large profits. The
consumer, who might have obtained the foreign
article, with low duties, at agreatly reduced price,
is thus forced to purchase it at the price enhanced
by the higher duties; and thus actually to pay
into the pockets of the manufacturer a tax, ay,
sir, a tax, which could be rightfully and consti-
tutionally levied for no purpose, save the expenses
of the Government, economically administered.
To illustrate this, we will suppose a cargo of
cotton goods brought from a foreign port, which
the importer without any duty could afford to
sell at twenty cents per yard; a duty of five cents
per yard is levied and collected; this, of course,
will increase the price of the goods to twenty-five
cents per yard, the manufacturer of the home ar-
ticle being thus enabled to demand and receive for
his goods the same price, and having no duty to
pay, of course, in addition to the profits that the
article at twenty cents per yard would have af-
forded, puts into his pockets also the five cents
duty which the importer has to pay to the Gov-
ernment. In order to show to what extent this sys-
tem may be carried, I will here read an extract
from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
under Mr. Polk, which I may add, is but another
evidence of the gross injustice and intolerable
burdens of the tariff of 1842.
"At least two thuds of the pies-ont taiifT (of 3812) arc
paid not into the Treasury, hut to the pioterted clause.-.. The
revenue from mipotts last year cxceeded$27,000,000. Tin?,
in itself, is a heavy burden; hut the whole tax imposed upon
the people by the present tariff is not less that $81,000,000,
of winch $27,000,000 are paid into the Treasury upon the im-
ports, and $54,000,000 to the protected classes in enhanced
prices of similar domestic articles."
Then, sir, it is not only a tax, but a heavy tax,
that the consumer is forccd to pay, not into the
Treasury for the support of the Government, but
into the pockets of manufacturers. It is imposed
and regulated by law just as a direct tax would
be; it is collccted just as the revenue now in the
Treasury has been; and the only difference be-
tween them, is that one is paid to the protected
class, the other to the Government. And then the
question arises, if the one is so paid, why may
not the other be used in the same way , or for any
other purpose? I confess my inability, sir, to
draw the distinction. But it may be said that
these same arguments would apply to any duty
for all, to some extent, protect. I answer, that
one is for the purpose of tcvenue and therefore
legitimate; the other for protection, without re-
gard to revenue, and therefore unconstitutional;
and if in any event, by the impost system, a tax
is paid by the consumer to the manufacturer,
surely a just Government will not increase the
burden beyond what is absolutely required for
Government purposes.
Now, sir, who are the principal contributors
to such gigantic annuities, extorted by legislative
force, and paid to the northern manufacturers?
We of the South and West, and the agricultural
interest of the North. Agriculture is emphat-
ically the great business of our people; it is the
prime source of our wealth and power as a nation.
Our cotton is the gieat motive power of trade; it
is the king of commerce and manufactures; it is
the currency of nations, always in demand,
always redeemable m silver, gold, or what you
will. We ask for it and our oilier products no
protection; we but ask to be let alone. Yet, sir,
this great interest of the people is to fettered
and burdened to build up a much smaller one,
and which is principally confined to one section;
thus repudiating the principle of the greatest good
to the greatest number, or that still more im-
portant principle of equal and exact justice to all.
Is this, sir, right? is it just ? Will not such a pol-
icy, m the future as in the past, meet with the
indignant rebuke of the American people, involv-
ing the party that dares advocate it in irretrieva-
ble dissolution and ruin. . ... • , •
But, sir, it is .contended, by some of th^ more,
zealous of the pitftectionists* with m$rezeal than
discretion, that the duty 4oeg .not enhance the
price of the article. Need .this be answered
it not absurd upon its face? May it not be said,
in full ans wer to such an assertion, that if this be
so, then there can be no protection, and, as aeon-
sequence, the manufacturer can derive no benefit
from it? Why, then,thiscontinuaIclamorforhigh
duties, and why these cries of distress? If it does
not enhance your price, certainly there can be no
relief. But, sir, I will let the great advocates of
protection speak for themselves. Mr. Clay, in
1833, said:
" In general, it may betaken as a rule that the duty upon
an aiticle forms a portion of its price."
Mr. Adams, as chairman of the Committee on
Manufactures, in 1832, made a report, from which
the following extracts are taken:
The doctrine that duties of impostoheapen the price Qf
the articles upon which they are levied, seems to conflict
with the first dictates of common sense. It is certainly con-
trary to the natural course of things that an addition to the
cost should be a redaction of the price of an article."
Again, sir, in the same report, he says:
" But the duty upon the article imported from abroad en
' abled the domestic producer to enter into competition with
I the impouer from abroad. So long as this competition con-
tinues, the duty operates as a bounty or premium to the do-
mestic manutaciuier. '1 he duty constitutes "a part of the
piice of the whole mass of the article in the market. By
whom is it paid? Certainly by the purchaser of the article,
whether of foreign or domestic manutacture. Upon one it
is a bounty, upon the other a burden ; and a repeal of the
tax must opeiate as an equivalent reduction of the price of
the article, whether foreign or domestic."
In 1894, Mr. Webster said: -
"To be?in with iron. The amount of our own manufac-
tures^,! think, seventeen thousand tons. The present duty
on the imported article is fifteen dollars per ton ; and as this
duty causes, of course, an equivalent augmentation in the
price of the home manufacture, the whole increase of price
is equal to §750.000 annually, which the consumer has to
pay, over and above what he could supply himself at with-
out the tax; and this to support a business that cannot sup-
port itself."
I have notgiven Mr. Webster's exact language,
but the substance of it, and nearly his own woros.
So much for the effect of the duty upon the price
of the article.
But it is again argued by others that, admitting
that the price of the domestic article is enhonceu
by the duty, the history of protective tariffs shows
there has been a corresponding increase in the
pricc of cotton and other agricultural products.
Not stopping to show the unreasonableness of
this proposition, I will content myself by pro-
ducing facts and figures, which are more potent
to convince than argument. I quote from De
Bow's Review, December, 1858. For the five
years preceding the tariff of 1828, the average
price of cotton was fourteen cents; for the five
years of its existence, the average price was nine
and nine tenths; for tho five years after its repeal,
the average price was fourteen and three tenths:
and so, for the five years preceding the tariff of
3842, the average price of cotton was eleven and
six tenths; for the five years during its existence,
seven and two tenths; and for the five years after
its repeal, nine and one tenth: thus showing, that
as the tariff was increased, the price of cotton
went down. Nor can this be said to be owing to
the amount of the crop; for, by the same state-
ment, the author shows that in 1827 the crop was
294,000,000 pounds, price ten cents. In the year
! 1831, when the tariff was in force, the crop was
! 270,000,000 pounds, the price nine and one tenth;
j showing a decrease in the crop of 18,000,000
pounds, and a falling off in the price of one cent
! per pound. And the same result appears by a
' still further comparison during the existence of
the tariff of 1828 and that of 1842. And so it
! might be shown, I doubt not, with regard toother
agricultural products. And, even if this were not
so, yet it is certain that by a high protective tariff
the South has to pay out of the price of her cot-
ton, for articles of necessity, an amount equal to
the duty levied over and above the sum at which
she could otherwise supply her necessities.
But, sir, I would not prostrate our manufactures.
I rejoice in their success and their prosperity. I
would rtffoid them that incidental protection, and
that only, which a tariff raised strictly for revenue
