take speedy advantage of the privileges afforded
by the national banking law passed by Congress
in 1861; that so large a portion of the national
currency was thus absorbed as to leave for the
new and rapidly growing States of the West
much less than their proportion^ that the
amount allowed to the State of Minnesota is
more than one million dollars short of her just
proportion; and the petitioners therefore pray
that the law may be so amended that the bank-
in <* capital for that State may be increased
