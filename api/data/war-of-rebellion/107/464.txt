General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg:

There are reports brought in that Wise's force has in considerable part gone south of the river in force enough to take Loop, Paint, and other creek roads with the design upon our trains so often rumored before. Reliable Union men say the increase on that side is great. Floyd continues near Cross-Lanes. There are reports of an intent to bring artillery over Cotton Hill. I keep small forces active in different directions, there being no considerable party of the enemy within easy striking distance. Matters draw to a focus.

GAULEY BRIDGE, August 30, 1861-6 a. m.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Reports make me feel some anxiety for our trains down the river. Pfau's cavalry go down to meet a forage train this morning. Colonel Lightburn reports great activity among the rebels all the way to the Ohio. The Union cause is hurt for lack of the streingth which is needed in the valley. We were informed yesterday that an immediately attack was tob e made here, and hoped it was true. The position of forces seems to be as indicated in my last. I am trying to get more accurate information as to numbers, which are exaggerated in reports, but it is difficult to do so.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
