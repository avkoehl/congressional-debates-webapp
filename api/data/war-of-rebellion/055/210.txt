to capture a battery (that was trying to escape with a small guard), which was done. The Ninety-seventh Ohio and Fortieth Indiana took the main road, supported by the One hundredth Illinois and Fifty-eighth Indiana, to be followed by the Fifty-seventh Indiana as soon as it could be formed (it having been deployed as skirmishers). Colonel Opdycke, One hundred and twenty-fifth Ohio, also accompanies me with a portion of Colonel Harker's command. Having advanced about three-fourths of a mile, we engaged the enemy, who was posted on a ridge commanding the road. A battery well covered by woods was stationed on the ridge, and opened on the column as soon as it came in sight. This was about nightfall, and it soon became so dark that it was very difficult to prevent confusion, but after a brisk fight of half an hour, and General Sheridan arriving with re-enforcements, we routed the enemy, capturing two pieces of artillery and some prisoners. Here we rested for four hours, when we again moved after the enemy, following him to Chickamauga Creek, whence we returned next day to Chattanooga.

The force engaged numbered about 1,800, the loss being as follows: Killed, 2 commissioned officers and 71 enlisted men; wounded, 51 commissioned officers and 587 enlisted men; missing, 2; total, 713.*

For particulars I refer you to the regimental reports. This loss was so great for the reason that a concentrated fire of artillery from the front and flanks was brought to bear upon my command, as well as a most deadly fire from small-arms. It is impossible here to speak of the gallantry of individuals when all did so well; each did his duty nobly, but I must be allowed to call the attention of the commanding general to Colonel Wood, Fifteenth Indiana Volunteers, who commanded the second line, for the ability displayed, and to him I am much indebted, as well as to

Lieutenant-Colonel Lennard, Fifty-seventh Indiana, of the first line, who acted with his usual gallantry. Lieutenant-Colonel Barnes, Ninety-seventh Ohio, deserves great credit for his soldierly bearing, as he at the head of his regiment led his men through that storm of bullets; but none deserve more credit than Lieutenant-Colonel Young, Twenty-sixth Ohio, who, with his own hands, planted his colors on the enemy's works, as well did Lieutenant-Colonel Neff, Fortieth Indiana, who, after several color bearers had fallen, took the colors and bore them up the hill, and in pursuit of the enemy, passing directly by Bragg's headquarters. Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, Fifty-eighth Indiana, and Major Hammond, One hundredth Illinois, commanding their respective regiments, performed their duty well. Major White, Fifteenth Indiana, although wounded, refused to leave the field until the ridge was carried, after which Captain Hegler assumed command of the regiment and deported himself so as to deserve promotion. The Fifty-first Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Comparet commanding, was absent, and not therefore engaged. To the members of my staff I am much indebted for the intelligent manner in which they assisted me on the field. Captain Tinney, with his usual gallantry, dashed up the line with first troops, and, with the aid of an orderly (G. W. Dusenberry, Fifteenth Indiana), turned the loaded guns of the enemy on his retreating ranks. Lieutenants Nicar and Royse,

aides-de-camp; Captain Aughe, inspector; Captain Hunter,

provost-marshal, and Lieutenant Jones, ordnance officer, were very efficient in the discharge of the duties during the hottest of the engagement.
