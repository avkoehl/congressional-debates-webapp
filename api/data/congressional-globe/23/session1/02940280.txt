THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 31.
Congress.    At the first session of the 221 Con-
gress, he voted uniformly w th tne opponents of
the bank, and lecoided his vote ogan st the bill to I
«charter that institution.   After his voie on the ,
bank, and after the Executive veto on that bil1, [
in August, 1832, ins rame went before the peo
pie of Mississippi for a reelection.    He was op- '
posed by the presses m sappoit of the bai k, on
the ground ot his vote, and his opposition to that I
institution.    The whole power ot the bai k was '
brought to bear on him, and at a time, too, when
absent, and unable to defend himself   With these
things known to the people ot the State, tor they
were not done in the coiner, he wd3 reelected by
a majority of the whole number of votes given at
the election.   Although he was undei  no posi-
tive pledge to oppose the bank, nor suppoit the
measuies of the Admimstiation,  there was an
implied pledge on his part to support the meas
ures advocated by the laboring pait of the com
rnunity—by the woiking men of Mississippi—to
whom alone he was indebted for his seat on that
floor.
He was (he said) opposed to reeliartering that
moneyed monster, and opposed to a íestoration of
the deposites, not because he wished to conciliate
General Jackson, for he sa.d he had never tound
lavor in his sight, but because he was opposed to
all licensed monopolies, to the conferring of ex-
clusive privrieges on any man, or comoration of
men. The Piesident advocated the pnnoiples of
the working men of the country, therefore d>d he
foupport him, whenever he abandoned those pnn-
ciples, he was in honoi bound to his constituents
to abandon him Mr P said he should be íe-
cieant to those who had honored him with their
suffrages, ana unworthy of the station he occu-
pied, if, under the cucumstances, he should vote
toi* a restoration of the deposites, or a rechaiter of
the bank. He had a high íespect for the opinions
of those whose names were mentioned on the face
of the resolutions, but for the puipose of showing
that there had been no change in public sentiment,
as has beeu infeiied, in Mississippi, ne must be
permitted to state, that all of them excepting one,
had always belonged to the National Republican
(he would not say Federal Bank) paity, and uni-
form opposers of the piesent Administration, and
the one excepted, was an admitted Fedeiahst,
and President ot the Bianeh Bank located at
Natchez
[Mr. CAGr heie corrected Mr Piummfr, and
said, if he had íeference to Colonel Willnns, that
it was a mistake ]
Mr P said if he was mistaken, it was because
he haíi lecently resigned
Mr P said that he wouli here take occasion to
repel a charge that had been made from a quaiter
which he did not think p'oper to name, because it
might be a violation of order, that his course on
this question " was the effect of party tiammels,"
that he was " under the influence of decided pai ty
discipline," that he had " become a mere autorna
ton," and disposed to "surrender his judgment,
and what he believed to be the best inteiests of the
peopleofMli.Bissippi,attheshuneofpatty " Mi
J?, said he,too,with his honorable colleague,should
"fearlessly do what he believed to be his duty,"
that he, too, with his honorable colleague, could
safely say, that " he had no interests" here, " un-
connected" with the interests of the people he had
the honor in part to represent. Charges such as
he had named came with a bad grace from those
who were under the necessity of placing themselves
under " trammels "and "party discmlme" to pro-
em e their election to a seat in that Hall. !t was
well knovm, he said, that he had never been a
favoriteof those who stood at the head of, and con-
tiolled the destinies of the Administration party m
Mississippi That hemight not be rmsundeistood,
he would particularize. He had never been sup-
ported by the Governor of the State, who was
considered by the party as their champion The
patronage of the General Government had been
airayed against him, if that could be considered
the patronage of the Government, which caused
the United States officers wuhm the State of Mis
eissippi to oppose his election Tnere were, at the
time he was elected to the station which he then
held, five newspapers within his distnct in sup-
port of the Administration Two of them, he said,
assailed him with all of the violence of po'itieal
paitisans, two of the.n admitted communications
against him, and refused or neglected to defend
h m, and ..he flfch one, a new paper, just then
established, had since discaided luna He had, he
said, received no furors at the hands of the ex-
ecutive branch of the Go verr men t, noi had he any
to ask He mentioned these things, not in a spirit
of comphmt towards the President, or any oí the
Heads of Departments, not out of any feeling* of
di i aspect to theGovernor ot theState—who com-
manded from i un that respect due to a generous
hei.it, and the high and responsible station whicn
he occupied—or any one else, but in justification
of his couse mere, and m reply toan attack made
against him and otheis on that floor, with wuom
ne acted on tht all-absorbing question of the bank,
in one of the newspapers printed in the State he
nad the honor in part to íepiebent
Mi   P   said, he did not piopose to occupy the
time of the House in responding to the common
newspaper  slang of tho e who were under   the
influence of the bank, nor did he deem it necessary
to notice the vulgar and abusive communications
of the letter-wuters, whethei over the signature of
"Major Downing," " The Spy," or any other
pooi,anonymous, nresponsible devil,who earned
ins daily bread by fabricating libels on the char-
acter of those who would not bow down and
woiship at the footstool of their master and em-
ployer—the Bank of the United 8tate¡>     But (he
sjud) when be saw a communication fiom autpon-
tibk souice, ovei the signatuie of an honorab'e gen
tleman, published m a public jou'nal,and ejide itiy
intended foi  the public eye, misrepresenting the
I opinions of high public functionaries, and contain-
I mg slanderous chaiges against a portion of the
i members of that House with whom he was asso-
ciated on a quest.on of great national importance,
he consideieu it not only his right, but I,is duty to
notice it m his place on the floor of that Hall, even
though it might possibly have been written by one
entitled to a seat within us walls     If (said  Mi
P ) the publication should have been first ma le in
his own State, and intended u mislead those whom
he had the honoi, in part, to repiesei i, and calcu-
lated tomjue him—if believed—n then estima-
tion, it would be due to his constituents as well as
to himself, that the misiepiesen a ion should  be
corrected, the  slanderous  charges  contiad.cted,
and things called by their light names
i     foi the purpose of bringing ti e Mmimstratior,
and those who suppoit its i leasures, mtodisrefute
among  the  people of Mississippi, it  lad   been
asserted by that high authority to v^nich he had
aheady made allusion, that ''iheieio no complaint
that the bank did not discfiaige piomptly and effi-
ciency all the di ties inquired of it by its cnaiter "
Now, sir, (said Mi   P ,) I undenake to Sdy, that
this statement is a wholesale peiversion of truth,
and misrepresentation of facts    Let us inquire
what is meant by this statement     it cannot lefer
to the bank, nor those opposed to the Administra-
tion , tor they have made no complaints against the
bank     It must, then, be intended to convey the
idea that no charges oi complaints have been made
from any souice "that the bank did not discharge
promptly and efficiently j'l of the duties leqmred
!, of" it by its chartei ¡" but that the Secretary of the
II Treasury removed  the deposites in violation of
'  la , without any complaint being made, without
■l any piovocation whatever, and, if he might be
1 allowed to use a legal phrase, with malice afore-
' thought, and without the fear of God before ins
,  eyes, and that those who sustained his couise on
that floor were p irticeps cnmnis in the transae
I   til n
To show the falsity of that statement, he would
I  orly mention such charges made against the bank
as had been not only clearly proven, but admitted
I  by its friends, and attempted to be justified     He
i  bes-ged  leave to call the attention of that lettei-
|  writer to the fact of the transaction of the most
|l important business by the bank, by the President,
and one or two others, when the chai ter expressly
provides that " not less than seven directois shall
constitutes board ¡or the transaction of business,"
|  to the exclusion of the Government dnectors alto-
gether from the board, to the effort on the pait of
the bank to postpone secietly, without the consent
of the Government, the payment of a portion of
the public debt, called tin  three per cent stocks,
to the unconscientious demand on the part of the
bank lor damages to the amount of $158,842 77,
on the protested bill diawn by the United States
on theFiench Govemmen , to the enoimous sums
of the people's money appiopnated illegally to
editors and printers for the purpose of abusing the
Piesidenlof the United Stales
Again, (said Mi P ,) this distinguished letter-
writer says, " It certainly nevei was intended to
' give to the Secretary of the Tieasu*y the regula-
' lion of the currency ot the country, by an unhm-
' ited contiol over the monejed institutions, and
' yet the Secretaiy, in his report to Congress, has
'Uaimed all this powei " No a, I undertake (said
Mr. P ) to say that he bas neither claimed nor
exercised any sucn powei lie has not, on any
occasion, attempted to regulate the currency of the
countiy He ins nevei a'  ny time exercised, or
at'empted to exercise, any control over the money-
ed institutions The 16 h sec'ion of the bank
chartei enacts " that th  deposites of the money
' of the Um ed States in phces in which the said
'bank or branches thereof may be established,
' shall be made m said bank or branches thereof,
'unless the Sec.etiry of the Treisury shall at any
' timeoihervviseorderand direct." In conformity
with the provisions of that act, the public moneys
were deposited in the United States Bank and
biaiches untilSeptembei last, when the Secretaiy
of lue Tieasuiy oideic,d and duee'ed that theie-
after they si ould be made in the State banks, for
r"asons >vInch he communicated to Congress at
the commencement of the session, as he lawfully
mig t do Was this regi'lating the currency of
the country ' Was this claiming a control over the
moneyed institutions' Or was it only desifnatmg
the place where tne money should be deposited for
safe keeping
Tue honorable letter-writer, (said Mr P ,) from
whom he hpd made sundry quotations, had pro-
pounded to the people of Mississippi aseries of in-
terrogatones, w'i'„h he read, and begged leave to
answer in then order Mr P said, if an apology
was due for occupying the time of the House m
responding to newspaper scribblers, it might be
found in the fiet that he stood hy himself va sup-
port of the Democracy of the State liere, and un-
I su| ported by any of the presses at home If he
should respond by a written communication to that
íenowned lettei-writer, there was no certainty of
i s being jmblished m the State which he had the
honor in part to lepresent Dunng the last ses-
sion of Congress, he said that he wjote several
lcteis, and dehveied speeches on several impoitant
ques ions, that we^e published m the city papers,
and republished m different pans of the Union,
nine of which found their way into the newspa-
pers of M ssi«sippi He thereforehoped the House
would allow him to do an act of justice to himself
and the Democracy of the Slate, which, fiom his
peculiar situation, he could not otherwise well do.
In answer to the following ímeriogatory—
" How do the people of Mississippi stand
' a°"ected in relation to the removal of the public
' deposites >"
l M>- P said that the Democracy" of Mississippi
stood unmoved and immovable—resolved to sacri-
fice " tneir lives, their fortune, and their sacred
honor," in defence of those rights and privileges
handed down to them by then fathers, ratherthan
permit themselves to be mide the slaves and vas
sals of an irresponsible corporation, wielding a
moneyed power which already shook our institu-
tions to the centre, and threatened to break down
the Constitution, trample on the laws, and pros-
trate the libeities of the people. This, said Mr.
P , is the way the great mass of the people, the
working men of the State, stand, and the way
tl ey will continue to stand, even if the pecuniary
distress should be greater than at present. There
is, however, said Mr P , another party, differ-
ently situated, and differently affected The Fed-
eralists of "98, of alien and sedition law memory—-
the anti-war party, of Hartford Convention mem-
ory—the old aristocracy of the State—the Na-
tional Republican party—the Bank party, and all
of the discordant materials (not exceeding one-
fourth of the State) who have uniformly opposed
the measures of the present Administrauon, (ex-
cepting the proclamation and enfoicwgbill,) "stand
affected" in favor of íechartering the United States
Bunk, and, consequently, in favor of restoring the
deposites   Not an original Jadteon-man was there
