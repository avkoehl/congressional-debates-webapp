SIR: I have the honor to report that my pickets have advanced beyond the house, and hold a portion of the enemy's pits which were occupied previous to my advance. The enemy's pickets are still in their pits off toward my right, as the Ninth Corps has not made any advance in that direction. The pits I now hold are in the same line as that held by the enemy on my right. I have directed the line to remain in its present position until further orders.
