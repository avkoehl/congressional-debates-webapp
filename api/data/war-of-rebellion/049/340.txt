COLONEL: I have the honor to report that while at teh right of the picket line, to post orderlies, as instructed by you, a sergeant of the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry came in and reported the following; That he, with a small squad, was posted on the Aldie pike as a post of observation; that about 50 of teh enemy's cavalry came through the woods on the right, thus cutting off their retreat by the Aldie pike; that they retreated across the country to the Gum Springs road, to where their pickets were posted, and found a body of the enemy's cavalry had come down the Gum Springs road, and the pickets had retired toward the Stone Bridge in confusion, leaving everything behind them. The sergeant came down the Gum Springs road, and taking the Warrenton pike, returned to his command.

A citizen, residing near where the cavalry pickets were posted on teh Gum Springs road, states the enemy's force that came down the Gum Springs road was not over 20, and supposed they were White's men. None of teh enemy's force were seen by teh infantry pickets.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant, and A. C. M., Second Div., First Army Corps.
