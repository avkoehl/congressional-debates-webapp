CAPTAIN: I have just been down at the river, and I find that there is but one section of the bridge there. The officer in command informs me that he cannot lay the bridge without more boats and bridge materials.

I would suggest that a party of cavalry be sent down the river to give warning of the approach of the rebel gun-boat Pedee, should it attempt to come up.
