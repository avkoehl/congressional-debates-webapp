by its title, and referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
The joint resolution (H. R. No. 459) author-
izing the Secretary of War to allow to the New
York and Oswego Midland Railroad Company
a right of way across a portion of the public
ground at Fort Ontario, Oswego, New York,
tor railroad purposes, was read twice by its
title.
Mi\ CONKLING. I ask that that resolution
may lie on the table for a moment, and if I get
the opportunity I will ask that it be taken up,
and with an explanation of a word will give
the Senate a knowledge of what it is.
The joint resolution was ordered to lie on the
table.
EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the
Interior, communicating information in relation
to the condition of the judiciary fund; which
was referred to the Committee on Appropria-
tions.
He also laid before the Senate a report from
the Attorney General, communicating, in com-
pliance with a resolution of the 5lh instant,
further information in relation to the case of
the United States vs. Vineente P. Gomez;
which was referred to the Committee on Pri-
vate Land Claims, and ordered to be printed.
WITHDRAWAL OF PAPERS.
Mr. HOWE. I move that William J. Black-
istone have leave to withdraw his petition and
papers. There has been an adverse report,
but I do not know any reason why he should
not be allowed to withdraw them, and he
thinks it important for his interests that he
should be allowed to do so.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order
will be entered if there be no objection.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is there any reason why
he should withdraw them contrary to the rule ?
The PRESIDENTjpro tempore. The papers
are withdrawn.
REMOVAL OF DISABILITIES'.
Mr. STEWART. I now move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of House bill
No. 1740.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill (H. R. No. 1746) for the
removal of certain disabilities from the per-
sons therein named.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the bill.
Mr. GRIMES. 1 do not think it is neces-
sary to read the names of those people. I
understand there are several hundred of them.
We have got to trust the Judiciary Committee,
■who have examined the subject.
Mr. BUCK ALE W. I want to hear them
read.
Mr. GRIMES. The names of several hun-
dred people?
Mr. BUCKALEW. Certainly.
The Chief Clerk continued the reading of
the bill.
The Committee on the Judiciary reported
the bill with amendments. The first amend-
ment was in line twelve, to strike out, the name
of L. A. Rale, of Bedford county, Virginia.
Mr. STEWART. The committee decided
riot to strike Sale out., and I will offer an amend-
ment which will replace that.
Mr. TRUMBFLL. Let the amendment of
the committee be voted down. That was recon-
sidered afterward.
Mr. STEWART. The Senate can act on
the report of the committee, and then let me
further amend the bill as I have got it corrected
in the spelling, &c.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Let us vote on this first.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment of the committee was
to insert after line sixty-four, under the head
of " Virginia
Augusts county: NicholasIC.Trout, Alexander II.
Fuliz, and Dr. Francis T. Striblinsr.
Pulaski county: 0. E. Doddridge.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to insert under the
head of "North Carolina," after line sixty-
nine, " Chowan county: William A. Moore."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to insert under
thehead of "Alabama," after line seventy-five,
"Tuscaloosa: Dr. Peter Pryce."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was under the head of
" Georgia," after line eighty-one, to insert
"Baldwin county: Dr. Thomas P. Green."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was under the head of
" Mississippi," after line eighty-eight, to insert
" Richland county : Dr. J. W. Parker, Thomas
J. Lamotte, and Ainsley H. Monteith."
Mr. SAWYER. It is intended to insert the
words "South Carolina," I think, at that point,
because these are South Carolina counties.
After the eighty-eighth line down to the one
hundred and third line are all South Carolina
counties.
Mr. STEWART. I will say to the Senator
from South Carolina that all those corrections
are made in the amendment I am about to offer.
If the Senator will allow me to withdraw the
committee's amendments and offer this amend-
ment, which is the committee's amendment in
substance, correcting all errors, we shall get
it right.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think the better way-
would be to disagree to the committee amend-
ments as they were reported, and let the Sen-
ator from Nevada now offer the amendments
that were subsequently agreed to. This matter
was under consideration some time in the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. We first agreed to
certain amendments, which are now being re-
ported by the Secretary, and subsequently other
amendments were made which change them.
Now, the better way would be to disagree to
the amendments that were reported by the com-
mittee, and let the Senator from Nevada, who
has revised the whole list under the direction
of the committee, including these names, offer
his amendment, and then it will come in at the
right place. I think that is the better course
and the shorter.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ate has agreed to several amendments.
Mr. STEWART. Well, I offer as a substi-
tute for the whole bill what I send to the Chair.
It covers the whole ground.
Mr." TRUMBULL. Have you the House
names in the substitute?
Mr. STEWART. Yes, sir; but some of the
names are spelt wrong as the bill came from
the House of Representatives.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. The substi-
tute will be reported.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the
amendment.
Mr. BUCKALEW. I suggest, if the amend-
ment shows on the face of it a distinction be-
tween what has been already read and what
the gentleman proposes to add, that the Clerk
only read the additions, the new matter pro-
posed in the ameudment.
Mr. CONKLING. It is simply an addition
of names.
Mr, STEWART. I do not suppose it will
be necessary to read the House bill all over.
The amendments as they appear ean be read
by the Clerk. They appear in what I send to
the Chair.
Mr. SAWYER. If I understand aright, the
bill up to the eighty-eighth line, as amended by
the committee, is precisely the same as has
already been read by the Clerk.
Mr. STEWART. No. If the Senator from
South Carolina will listen to it now he will
understand it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be
read.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment of Mr.
Stewart, which was to strike out all of the
bill after the enacting clause and insert:
