JULY 20, 1863.

General JUDAH, Maysville:

Move at once for Portsmouth, and then be governed by circumstances. Let Manson and the gunboats protect the river. You ought to be in time to head Morgan off. Be careful in disembarking to have the steamboats protected from capture. Do not lose a moment's time. communicate with Hubson as soon as possible, and I know you will co-operate with him to the extent of your power. It is but just to him, after making so long a chase, to allow him to retain a separate command of his own column. If you desire further instruction, telegraph. I have instructed General White, whit a force at Big Sandy, to co-operate with you. Say as much to Manson, when you pass him.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

BUFFINGTON BAR, July 20, 1863-9.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Dispatch received. Everything working well. I send by boats to Cincinnati 704 prisoners, including 48 commissioned officers, among them Cols. Basil [W.] Duke and Dick [R. C.] Morgan and Captains [T. H.] Hines and Shell. The Twelfth Kentucky has 125 more prisoners, I have ordered to Pomeroy. Excepting a small force to clear out captured property here, all the forces move immediately after the balance in pursuit. I go to Pomeroy at once, by boat, whit my escort, and some artillery. I will meet more of the cavalry near there. No relaxation in pursuit by any one.

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

POMEROY, July 20, 1863-10.30 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Have just arrived. The Fourteenth Illinois is within 3 miles of town. I hardly know the exact condition of things, but will in half an hour, and act at once. Dispatch just received that Morgan, with 500 men, had gone up Champaign Creek, our cavalry after him. I came down with Captain Sebastian, and may go on with him and my artillery.

H. M. JUDAH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

JULY 20, 1863.

General MANSON, Portsmouth:

I don't think you will be started before evening. It is necessary to hear something definite from the fight that is now going on at Buffington. Morgan has gunboats in his front and Hobson and Judah in rear. Scammon has gone up from Pomeroy with two infantry regiments. Keep the operator on the lookout for a message from me.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
