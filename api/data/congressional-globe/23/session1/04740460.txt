THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 17,
tions relative to the management of the Post Office,
might be laid on the table and printed
Mr CONNOR suggested that a bill compre-
hending the provisions contained in these resolu-
tions, as well as several others, was now depending
in the other end of the Capitol.
After a bnef explanation from Mr JONES, the
motion was negatived
Mr STODDERT, from the Committee on Pat-
ents, leported a bill to lenew the p'atent right of
William Perkins, which was read twice, and com-
mitted
CUMBERLAND ROAD BILL.
The House then proceeded to the unfinished
busmebS of yesterday, being the bi'l for the con-
tinuation and repair of the Cumberland road
Mr GiLMER moved to reconsider the vote by
which the motion of Mr Polk to reduce the
appropnition for repairing the load 'rom gbo2,000
to $,300,000 was yesterday rejected
Mr STEWART said the friends of the bill
would vote in favor of the ame-idment if the re-
striction m the next section bhould be stricken out.
If the supporters of the amendment would intimate
their willingness to accede to that proposition, no
objection would be made to the amendment
Mr HA WES hoped no such intimation would
be given He was opposed to the whole system
Unless an end was put to the log rolling which
prevailed in this House in relation to internal lm
provementSjit would be necessaiy to increase the
tariff to keep the Treasury fiom bankruptcy The
immense amount of appropriations which had
already passed the House were sufficient, he be-
lieved, to exhaust the Tieasury
Mr BROWN said he voted yesteiday against
the proposition of the honorable gentleman from
Tennessee, [Mi Polk,] and, upon refiection, he
now thought the vote was wrong It had been his
intention to move for a reconsideiation this morn-
ing, but it ga"Ve him pleasure to find he hud been
anticipated by the honorable gentleman from
Georgia, [Mr Gilmer] He was not unfriendly
to such an appropriation as would finish the load
-when he considered the compact made by fie Grov-
el nment, but he doubted very much whether the
Tieasury would be able to bear so large an appio
puation of the public money for tins single pul-
póse during the present year He hoped the ob-
nervatioiisofthehotiorablemembei from Kentucky
IMr Hawes] would not be entnely lost upon the
House He hoped honorable gentlemen would
look about them and see wheie all these linmenbe
appropmti >rs will ultimately lead us He admit-
ted to a ceitam extent the obligation of the Gov-
ernment to complete this load,and he would will
ingly, at the pioper ture, vote foi such a sum as
would finish and put it in a condition to be sur
rendeied to the seveial States tin ">ugh which it
passes, and thus rid the na ion foi ever from these
continjal, and what seemed to him extravagant
and nevei ending expendituies of the public
money Unless he was much mistaken, the friends
of the bill admitted that no moiethan §300,000
could be expended upon the load dunng the pies-
ent year, and he therefoie, upon leflection, deemed
it most prudent to limit the present appropriation
to that sum Heohould vote for the reconsidera-
tion of the motion to amend, and should it pre-
vail, he would then record Ins rote in favor of the
sum proposed by the honorable gentleman from
Tennessee
Mr EWING opposed the reconsideration at
length
Mr H iRDIN went at length into an explana-
tion of theobligation resting upon the United fetates
to make this road Mr II expressed his alarm
at the amount of the appropriations for various
works of internal improvement contained in the
bill aheady reported, which he estimated to be
twenty million  With regaid to this load, he
thought the ¿,2,500,000 which had been expended
upon it solely to enab'e Baltimoie to compete with
Philadelphia was quite enough ¡f a road to the
West was necessary, why not make a road by the
White Sulphur Springs and the Kenawha, which
was a hundied miles neaier' If the friends of t're
bill were not satisfied with the <$30d,000 proposed
by" the amendment, ne hoped they would not
obtain more bv the vote of the House
Mr F THOMAS repl ed m detail to the argu-
ments and suggestions of Mr. Hafdin Mr. T.
expressed his willingness to accede to the propo-
sitions of Messrs Sutherland and Dicklkson,
providing that only $,300 000 should be expended
during the present year, and that no further sum
should be laid out upon the road until the States
should signify then assent to take and maintain
the road when the whole should be expended, and
hoped the House would fauly meet the question,
whether the road should be fully and finahy re-
paned by the United States, oi should be aban-
doned—which he considered to be involved m this
motion to reconsider, unless the ¡imitation was
stiuck from the bill
Mr EURGES opposed the motion to recon-
sider, and explained his views of the mutual and
lelative interests of the eastern and western States
at length
Mr. CAMBRELENG concurred in opinion
with the gentleman fiom Vnginia, [Mr Archlr ]
He was willing to vote foi almost any sum that
would enable us to get rid of the road, and transfei
it to the States through which it passed But he
feaied it would be as difficult for us to i id ourselves
of the Cumberland road as it would be for certain
gen lemen to abandon ano therun pi ofi table concern
He was by no means opposed to the object in
view, but the appiopnation snould be made with
rtference to the actual condition of the revenue,
whdtevei amount might be applied during the
piesent year It was not so much with a view to
this single object that he Ind usen, but to notice
all extraoidmaiy appropuations, ard to ask gen-
tlemen, before tney pioceeded fuither in authon
zing expendituies not ncluded in the annual esti-
mate submitted by the Tieasury, to inquire into
the condition oí the revenue foi 1834 He con
curred entirely with the gentleman fiom Ken-
tucky, [Mr Haiuiim ] that the state of the Treas
uiy did not authonze such extraordinary expen-
dituies The sum of eleven hundred thousand
dollars was appropriated by this bill We had
bills amounting to about thiee millions for expen-
dituies in this District and the neighborhood
There were bills now before us embracing appio-
pnations amounting to moi e than five millions, for
objects which were not included in the Trtasuiy
estimates, wmch bills, it was expected by gentle-
men we should act upon Beiore we do so, we
should look into the state of the tieasury for 1834
The balance in the tieasury, and the estim ited
receipts for the year, from all sources, amount to
twenty six millions and a lialf, the expendituies
of the year, embracing only those included in the
ecu ma es,and ilioAringnn eq lal amount for unex
pended balances of appropuations at the beginning
and at the end of they eai, amount to twenty thiee
mi lions and a half, including five millions for the
public debt aid intciest—leaving a surplus of
uuee millions If we make the same extraoidi
naiy appropilations at this as at the last session,
of thiee millions and a half, there would be a defi-
cit of half a million at the end of the year He
had no doubt that the receipts of the year would
equal the estimate of the Secretary of the Tieas
ury—they mightpeihaps exceed it—-but we should
recollect how much the resources of the year hi d
been diminished At the commencement of 1833
,ve had, of available revenue bonds, twenty one
millions and a 'idlf, while on the let of January
lust we had but seven milliors and a half, mukmg
a difference of fourteen mil lions, and we commenced
the yeai w th a leduci on of about two millions
m out revenue from imports—making the re
sources for 1834 below those of 1833 sixteen mil-
lions With this Knowledge, we weienot author-
ized to make large appropriations for extiaordi
nary ob]ects If we did so, this House, and not
the treasury, would be held accountable for any
deficiency
We heai mucn of the increase cf Government
expenditures, but we overlook tne causes it is in
this hasfy legislation, at the close of the session,
when miihoiib areappiopnated without proper ex-
amination, in our piesidential contests, when mil-
lions are authorized undei political influences, in
the great stiuggle between the 'anfTand anti taiiff
sides of the House—the former endeavoring to in-
crease the expenditures to sustain a laige revenue,
the latter struggling to bring down the revenue to
a just and moderate measuie of national expendi-
ture    These were the causes, and the measures
laying the foundation of new and hea\y additions
to  our annual expense, were uniformly hurried
through the House during the last week of the
] session—and too fiequently on the \ ery last night
This was the gieat cause of our recent increase of
expenditures     It originated with ti e legislative,
' and not with the executive branch of the Govern-
1 ment—and the corrective should begin here—in
this House    Theie never could be any compre-
| hensive, effectual, or substantial system ofietrench-
1 ment of the expenditures of Government, till this
habit of authorizing extraordinaiy expenditures,in
I the gioss, at the close of the session, was reformed
' As long as it is continued, our Fedeial expenditures
must go on rapidly increasing, and it is not the ex-
ecutive branch of the Government, but this House,
, which should be held accountable to the country
for this steady increase of the expenses of Govern-
I ment    Dunng the laot night of business of the last
' session, \ve appropriated eight hundied thousand
dollars for tint, District     We had now before us
bills amounting in their ultimate consequences to
. more than three millions foi  this District alone
| in 1829 we la.d the foundation for an expenditure
of many millions at the mouth of the Delaware
It was in this way that almost all our met ease of
Fedeial expendituies vas justly to be ascubed to
legislative and not to executive origin      it was not
from opposition to this bill particulaily that he had
made these remaiks     He should pursue the same
course in regard to all other expenditures not indis-
pensably requued for the seiviceof theyear    He
should, when the question came before us, support
the motion which the gentleman from Tennessee
[Mr  Polk] piomised to make, to stnke out the
appropuations for for tificat ons not yet commenced
He would do so for anothei reason—in the hope
that, befoie the next session, the subject would
atfact the attention of the War Depaitment, and
that a system would be proposed, similar to that
adopted in regard to the navy—appropriating a
fixed sum annually for the gradual enlargement of
fortifications, furnisl mgthem with ordnance, &c ,
to be placed under the direction of able officers to
be distnbuted to one object or another as they
might  deem   most  fit  for the national  interest
Without such a system, some of our fortifications
never would be supplied with ordnance, while our
I appropuations for fortifications would go on annu-
ally increasing and   be annually contested      He
hoped that no expendí ture, not absolutely required,
" would be authorized for this or any other purpose,
¡  and that gentlemen would unite, on all sides, in
I   anesting the progress of our annual expenditures
' and in an attempt to diminish those Government
'   expenses which had originated in measures of oui
II  own, hastily adopted anu too generally growing
Í   out  of  political   causes      Witn  regard   to  this
measure, he hoped the sum of eleven hundred
thousand dolíais, the ablegate proposed in the
different sections of the bill, would be reduced
to an amount corresponding to the state of the
| ¡ Treasury
¡¡     Mr THOMAS, of Maryland, contended that
| J the proposed expenditure was taken into account
in the Treasury estimates
I     Messrs CHILTON and DUNCAN spoke in
I suppoitof the bill, and in opposition to the motion
to reconsider
Mr PARIvS said he had heard of the Cumber-
land road for many years, and every year we had
been told 'hat the sum asked would be the last
which would be wanted It appeared, from state-
ments made here this morning, that one hundred
and thirtv two miles of the road had cost two and
a half millions of dollars, which was equal to
]9,774 dollars a mile It should be recollected,
too, that this road, which had cost so much, run
thiough one of the most fertile regions of this
country He would now call the attention of the
House to the expense of road making in the State
of Maine A few years ago, a military post having
been established on the northeastern frontier, it
was thought expedient to make a load to it, for
the conveyance of stores, troops, &c The dis-
tance was seventy miles, the whole lying in an
uninhabited and entangled forest, and the provi-
sions used bv the laboiers were brought fiom this
very Ohio country But this load cost on'y tven-
tv «ne hundied dolíais a mile and he assured the
House that the greater part of it—for he was over it
last fall—was as solid, smooth, and perfec, as the
