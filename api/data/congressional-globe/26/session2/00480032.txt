our substance. No, but because out trustees—be-
cause those with whom the money of the people
had been placed for safe keeping, could not pay
upon demand according to our laws—because our
millions upon millions were without our contiol, in
the beeping of banking institutions, and the ere lit
of the people was resorted to to sustain the faith
and honor of the country. What was the extent
of the power then conferred upon t! e Admimstia-
tion to contract a debt1 If his recollection served
him, it was $10,000 000 And what were oiu
dues from the banks alone1 If he was not mista-
ken, some thuteen or four een million rt d liars,
and beyond that, one of the prominent and worlhj
objects of the loan was to exttnd indulge c« upon
¿toy bond-; to the merchants cf the ct untry, who
■were equally distressed with the public treasury
from jfÜhOTuKjons of the time Under such or
cumataiee, it was that the present Adm lustration
"began a debt m time of peice "
The next posrion of the honorable Senator is
that the administration of Mi Van Bureti ha^ ex-
pended msch more ¡roaey annually than the
accruing re/enue Tbpt he (Mr Wright) be
heved to le true, bin he did not proposed
to fellow ih° Senator at all m the data given
toprove the po mon, he would say what he
was sure would not be controverted, that the Ad-
mmi tration hid expended, jeir by year, ja<tso
much and no mpie money than Congress had ap
propnated and ordered to be expended—that every
year the appropriations of Congre s had exceeded
by mill ons the estimates of expenditure pie en ed
to ll by the Executive Department—anil that it
was a matter lor Congress to provide the means to
meet theexpendituresitself directed Bat it would
not have betn unjust to that Administration if the
honorable Senator had said, in passm?, that during
every yeir of its exis'enc e, the it ?ss ot ihe public
expendí u es had been maten?)!/ and rapidly rt
ducel. The expendituies ot lb33 were hown by
the President's message and the Secietai/'s report,
the two document" to which the Senator had reft r
red in this discussion, to be less than of 1837
Those of 1839 were some mx millions less, these
tor 1840 had been from two to thiee millions less
than those for 1839, and the estimates fci H41
Wire materially less than those for any pac un"
year Th s, then, wis both side  of the book—t
was the present Administration ns it is, in refer
ence to expenditure During Us term, those expen-
dí tires had been unds-gomg a rapid íeduui n,
from the conmencement of its four yeirs to the

the mat or
The next position taken by the honorable Sent
tor was the most malerial one m his aignment, and
without which Mr W might not have t< It htm ell
called upon to make this reply The Senator did
not even assert his po nt, but in a wanner mrsr
courteous, expressed his opm on that Ihe Prcsile-H
had made a vatiety of misiakes and omiss ons in
hts statement of the present national debt, as given
in his message, that the country t , in iait, mors in
debt than the President ard Secre ary of the Tre i-
sur> have represented uto be,and thai, without his

the honorable Senator, and to try ih«-m by the f ( «,

and as tie amount uhcb woult oors mte «he

Now, ho  had trie Senator sought to show ihat the
President had been mivtaken? By reficrung to what
was called the trust fands, and pircmally and h^
believed entirely, to those portions of those funds
which appertain to the Indians.  In reference to the
Indian trust funds, he said not that the fact was so,
but that, on eTammation, he w?s inclined to be-
beheve that portions of them had been actually
expended for the ordinary uses of the Treasury, and
were now a debt resting upon the countrj, that the
moneys stipulated by Indian treaties to be invested
had not been all invested, but that some hundreds
of thousands of dollars of those moneys had been
paid out and expended, and were now a debt
against ihe Treasary. He (Mr Wright) had
taken as much pains to obtain information upon
these points as the, ti ne which had elapsed since the
Senator's remark- were made would permi', and
■>s he dewgn-d lo sla'e the facts fairly, plainly, and
truly, as far as he was able, and as the vanon3
Indian treaties varied in th=ir prov sion  as to the
trusts constituted undet ih^m, and conferred upon
the Unit d Sta e«, he would be compelled to sp-ak
of ceitam treaties and certain trusts =ep>ratWy,
each by itself, to mal e himself undertoo 1, and to
enable others to understand the facts He would
lefer, then, m the first place, to the treaty with the
Chicka a \ Indian', as ihat treaty was peculiar, ind
the trust constituted and a«-sum d was novel in
cur d<- lings with the Indian tubes In this case,
the United S atts had become the voluntary trustee
of the Chiekasa ", and had stipulated to «ell
the ríanos as the public dorr am of the United S ate
issold, to deduct simply Ihe expens s of the treaty, of
the survey and sale of the lands, "nd *uch other
expenses as might be incurred for account of the
Indian , not including any commission or other
cc mpersation to the trustee, and to account to th^m
for all the moneys which shalliemun unexpended
In olhci words the treaty binds the United States
lo «ell the lands of these Indi rs to the bf «t ddvan-
t«ge, to account [to them for the whole proceeds
and to manage such of their cash funds as shall
remain in the hards of the Government, witruut
charge for tiouble or r sp(risibility
Up^n inqjiry at t e Tret nry Departmen', he
lenned tint a law of Congre s had placed the prm

ticaty in charge pf the head of trntd partment, for

longing to Chidiasaw orphans and to certain

In/estmen'sof Indian moneys, to large amounts,
had been made both under too direct on of tbe Sec-
retary of War and the Secretary of the Treasury,
and accounts of the ttansactions had been ¡and be-
fore Congress The honorable Senator had referred
to th m, and had spoken of the prices in soiat cases
paid for stocks, m a mauner to give the impression
that he suspected the investments had not been pm-
dently and cautiously made. Mr Wright believed
all the investments had been confined to st ¡cks of
the States, a description of security waich he felt
sure that Senator would not willingly depreciate 01
disparage, and it he would refer to the cU es of the
respeeti/e investments, and to the prices current ot
the stock m the principal markets of the country,
at the several period*, little ground would be dis
covered for complaint upon th s point
He yvould now pass to pnoiher class of refer-
ences made by tly honorable Senator, and wher ,
in the opinion of Mr Wright, he approximated
more nearly to the discovery of a debt, techninally
speaking, which is not noticed by the President
He alluded lo the Senator's reference to several
Ind an treities in a group, viz

These treaties siverally stipulate that the sums
above named shall be invested by' the United States
for the benefit 1 f the several tribes of Indians
ramed, and he belies ed it to be true that, as jet,
rone of tie sums had been invested, but that Con-
gress had prcfened to appropriate annually ihe ir>
terest upon them as a part of tbe current annual
expenses of the country All of the treaties except
ore, that with the Delawares, had been concluded
since the commencement of the year 1837, and his
information was that, in all the case*, very few
sales of the lands, ceded by the re pecttve treaties,
had yet teen made, not enough, m many cases, to
cover the expenses of the treaties, and in none suffi-
cient to bring into the Treasuiy any considerable
poition ol the capital required to be investí d
Ano ' er lea on exists for the non-mvestme-t of
the'e sums, which has its fountiati m in the Corsti
tution of the coun'ry It is that Co' gress has
re ttier providtd nor appropriated the mo'iey re-
quired to make the mve tmen , and witho tan
<ppiopiation by h\ , nn her the Secret?iy of the
Tre^tin, nor the Pie ident, can take money from
