Brigadier General W. S. WALKER, Pocotaligo, S. C.:

Movements of enemy make it necessary that your district and that of General Mercer should, for present, be under a common commander. Major-General Gilmer has been directed to assume that general command. Returns and reports, however, will be made as usual by you to these headquarters, in addition to any General Gilmer may require. Some troops will be sent you.

By order of General Beauregard:

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

(Same to Brigadier General H. W. Merce, Savannah, Ga.)
