GENERAL HDQRS. CAV. FORCES, MIL, DIV., OF W. MISS., ORDERS, Camp at Foxworth's Farm, Seven Miles from Numbers 11. Columbia, Miss., December 4, 1864.

From this time onward division commanders are requested to use more caution while on the march, looking out well to their front and rear, and sending out flankers. The left flank particularly must be closely watched. When the road passes through thick woods, or is bounded on other side by dense underbrush, skirmishes should be thrown out in advance of the command and every precaution should be taken to guard against surprise. The division columns and division trains should be kept well closed up at all times.

By order of Brigadier-General Davidson:

A. S. MONTGOMERY,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
