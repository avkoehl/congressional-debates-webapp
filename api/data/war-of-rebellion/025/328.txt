back. They had out five regiments of cavalry yesterday, which were all driven back. Colonel Lee is advancing his cavalry cautiously to find out the truth of the matter. I cannot hear anything of General Quinby, though I have sent several couriers to find him.

The prisoners are just starting in.

Yours, truly,

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

IN THE FIELD, 5 1/2 MILES FROM LA GRANGE,

November 8, 1862 - 11.45 a. m.

Major-General GRANT:

My column is all united at this point, where the road from Grand Junction comes in.

The cavalry under Colonel Lee have just arrived, and have gone on in advance. I have established a courier post 4 1/2 miles from La Grange, at the forks of the road. General Quinby's division will not be up for two or three hours. I shall, however, push on cautiously to Lamar or vicinity.

Would it not be well to keep a strong lookout on the Moscow road?

Some few of the rebel pickets have been seen.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

LAMAR, November 8, 1862 - 3 p. m.

Major-General GRANT:

Have just reached this point. The advance under Colonel Lee had some pretty sharp skirmishing with rebel cavalry a short distance beyond here. I shall halt my column here until General Quinby comes up, unless I hear something definite from the front.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,La Grange, November 8, 1862.

Major-General MCPHERSON,

Commanding Reconnaissance:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is received. Well done so far. I hope it will turn out as well throughout. My hope rather favors [their] remaining at Holly Springs. The opportunity of attacking there is better than it would be with the Tallahatchie between. The only particular advantage I can see for us having the rebels abandon Holly Springs is that we would then cover Corinth somewhat better. I will hold two divisions in readiness to-morrow should you require re-enforcements. Take no risks for a general engagement; we are not ready for that. Send in your prisoners in the morning under a proper escort.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
