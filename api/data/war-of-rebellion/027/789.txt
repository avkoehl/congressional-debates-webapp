Colonel DIXON S. MILES, Harper's Ferry:

COLONEL: You will inform me by return mail to what regiment the cavalry captured by the enemy belonged. It appears to me that these men are wholly unworthy of trust, as they were taken while at dinner. I hope you will be careful in your selection of men sent out on picket. I all such cases you ought to select an officer in whom you have full confidence, and with instructions to guard against surprise. I will send, in a day or two, a regiment of cavalry in which you can confide.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel WHIPPLE,

The enemy's cavalry are increasing on Winchester road. Trains have to be guarded by infantry escort. To run the road with safety much longer will require a cavalry regiment, and I hope one will be sent me immediately.
