except those of invalids.   The twelfth is $429>
987 90 for pureha-ing land  from   Indians, and
paying for Indian depredation's.   The  thirteenih,
and last uein, is the sum of $296,960 21 ftr mis-
oellaneous objects, and  for property lost, or inju-
ries committed, daring hostilities with any power.
The total of all these items, except the public debt,
is f8,293,353 66-   This total, added to the sum
paid on account of the public debt,, makes close
upon twenty-five millions of dollars; and this, de-
ducted from the aggregate of near thirty-two mil-
lions, leaves a fiaction over seven millions for the
real expenses of the Government—the  ordinary
and permanent expenses—during the last year of
Mr. Monroe's administration.   This is certainly a
satisfactory result.    It exempts the Administration
of that period from the imputation of extravagance,
which the nnexptai* ed exhibition of the aggregate
exptndttures might have drawn upon it in the
minds of Uninformed persons.   It clears that Ad-
ministration from all blame.    It must be satisfac-
tory to every candid mind.    And now let ns apply
the test of the same examination to some year of
the present Administration, now so incontinently
charged with ruinous extravagance.    Let us see
how the same rule will work when applied to the
present period; an!, for that purpose,  let us take
the last year in the table, that of 1839.   Let others
take any year that they please, or as many as ihey
please: I take one, because I only propose to give
an example; and I take the last one in the table,
because it is the laft.   Let ns proceed  with this
examination, and see what the results, actual and
comparative, will be.
Commencing with the aggreaate payments from
the Treasury for all objects, Mr. B. said it would
best en at the foot of the first co'umn in the fmt
table, that they amounted to $37,129,306 80; pass-
ing to the second column, at>d it would b  seen
that this sum was reduced to $25,982,797 75; and
passing to the third, and it would be s*en that this
latter sum was itself reduced to $13,525,800 18;
and, referring to the second table, under the year
1839, and it would be seen how this aggregate of
thirty-seven millions was reduced to thiiteen and a
half. It was a «treat reduction; a reduction of
nearly two-thirds from the aggregate amount paid
out; and left for the proper expenses of the Go-
vernment—its ordinary and permanent ex penses—
an inconceivably sma¡l sum for a great nation* of
seventeen millions of souls, covering an immense
extent of territory, and acting a part among the
great powers of the world. To trace this reduc-
tion—to show the reasons of the difference between
the first and the third columns,Mr. B. would follow
the same process whtch he had pursued in explain-
ing the expenditures of the year 1824, and a^k for
nothing in one case  hich had not been granted in
the other.
1. The first hem to be deducted from the thirty-se-
ven million a§g ega e,wa«thesumof$l 1,146,599 05
paid on account of the public debt. He repeated,
on account of the public debt; for it was paid in
redemption of Treasury no:es; and these Treasury
notes were so much debt incurred to supply the
place of the revenne deposited with the Stae s, in
1836, or shut up in banks during the suspension of
1837,   ordae from meichants, to whom indulgence
had been granted. To supply the place of ihese
unattainable funds, the Government went in debt by
issuing Treasury notes; but faithful to ihe senti-
ment which abhorred a national debt, i< paid tff
the debt almost as f?st as ir contracted it. Above
eleven millions of this debt was paid in 1839,
amounting to almost the one third part of the ag-
gregate expenditure oi that year; and thus, nearly
the one third part of the sum which is charged upon
the Administration as extravagance and corruption,
was amere payment of debt!—a mere payment of
Treasury notes which we had issued to supply the
place of our misplaced revenue. This item being
deducted from the 37 millions, reduce* it to 26.
2.  The second item to be deducted is stated in
the table under the description of trust fund*; and
consists of money received in trust for the Chica-
ner Indians, and other Indians, on the sale of their
lands, for which the United States act as their
agent and treasurer. Tt amounts to near a quarter
pfamiliion, to wit, $240,694 for the year 1339;
but for the three preceding years averaged a mil-
lion and a quarter, and contributed largely to swell
the expenditure?, as they were termed, of 1836,
H37, and 1838. This item had no existence in-
the year 1824; so that it becomes a new charge, ap
patently, upon the Treasury; but in íeality no
charge at all, as it was only delivering over to In-
dians the money which had been received for
them, and belonged to them. Yet this item,
amounting to nearly four millions in the last four
years, is set down to the reckless extravagance of
a mad and ruinousAdministration.
3.  The third item to be deducted is the sum of
$717,552 27, for indemnities; that is to say, for
moneys recovered from foreign nations, under
Gen. Jackson's administration, for merchants who
had been plundered under previous Administra-
tions—whose money, when received, had gone in-
to our Treasury, and was afterwards paid out to
the rightful owners a* their respective rights were
ascertained. The payment for 1839 was near
three quarters of a million; but for the three pre-
vious years they amounted in the whole to about
five and a half million;-; and, according to the ac-
cusation of the Opposition gentlemen, constituted
so much of the horrid extravagance of those years!
and here let us mark the difference between the pre-
sent times and those of 1824. When, in that year,
the sum of near five millions was paid out of the
Treasury for indemnities to meichants under the
Florida treaty, no one ever thought of making the
people believe that it was a part of the expenses of
the Government. No one ever thought of injuring
the Administration about it. These conceptions
have been reserved for the present day. Now, for
the first time in the hNtory of our country, or per-
haps of any country, the recovery of indemnities
from foreigners, and their payment tc our own citi-
zens, becomes a dreadful extravagance—a ruinous
waste of money—for which a mad and profligate
Administration must be thiust from powr!
4.  The fourth item is a small sum of $4,875 50
for claims of States on account of expenditures
for the general benefit during the late war. It
was a payment of debt, and not an expense of Go-
vernment, and though small in 1839, it had beencon-
*;d erahle in the three preceding years, amounting
in that time to' about $230,000; and, of couse,
swelling by that much the aggregate expenditures
of those years, and help.ng to make up ihe mon-
strous extravagance of which the country heard
so much.
5.  The next itrm grows out of the three per
centum fund to the new States on the amount of
the lands sold within their limits. It is due to the
States by compact, as a consideration, and a most
inadequate one it is, for not taxing the Federal
lands. For the year 1839, this item amounted to
$63,670; and, being a debt due to the Sates, is
no part of the Government expenses. For the
three previous years, «hen the land sales were
at the largest, and when some of the Sates had
neglected for some years to draw their money, the
payments on this account amounted to near one
and a half millions of dollars; and, of course,
swelled to that amount the extravagance of 1836,
'37, and '38! In the year 1824, this item was
only $47,714.
6.  The sixih item to be deducted was nearly al-
lied to the former. It was $198,530 for the two per
centum on the sales of the public lands to make
roads to the new States, and applicable to the
Cumberland road. In the year 1824 it was only
$17 000; but m the great sales of 1835, '6, and '7,
it amounted to near $1,200,000. Htre again was
a payment of a debt converted into wasteful extra-
vagance !
7.  Donations of monev to, or payments on ac-
count of, the District of Columbia, was the seventh
item of deduction which Mr. B. mentioned. It
amounted to $126,374 for the year 1839. It was a
new item in the list of Government payments,
having no existence in 1824, nor until the year
1832. After that time it had been annual, and as
high as $313,000 in one year, to wit, 1833, and for
the years 1836, '7, and '8, amounted to near
$440,000. It was a gratuity to the District, which
had no political rights; and it was a gratuity which
hadjio other object than to relieve it from burthens
improvidently contracted; yet received the usual
character of corrupt extravagance.
8.  The survey of the coast was the eighth itfm
which Mr. B. explained. It was a temporary and
extraordinary object, which had grown up from a
trifle to a large amount within a few years past,
and amounted to $91,995 for the year 1339. pre.'
vious to General Jackson's administration it rarely
exceeded two thousand dollars per annum; for the
ye irs 1836-7 and 8, it amounted to about $220,000.
9.  Duties refunded to merchants was another of
the new and large items which had laiely grown
up among our Treasury payments. From 1824
to 1832, it was unknown; yet in 18S9, it was
$179,304; in the year 1833, it was $701,000, and
for 1836-7, and 8, it amounted to above $800,000.
This was a favor, or an act of justice to merchants,
granted by acts of Congress, or by judicial deci-
sions, or by reversal of previous constructions of
the laws. It is no part of the Government expen-
diture, though, being refunded from the Treasury,
it goes into the enumeration to swell the general
aggregate—to swell the cry of extravagance—and to
prove the hostility of the Administration to mer-
chants !
10.  A tenth item to be deducted was the sum of
$714,857 for collecting materials for the increase
of the navy. This was an expenditure for the fu-
ture defence of the country, and averaged about
$800,000 per annum since the commencement of
General Jackson's administration, though only
$423,000 in 1824. It is clearly no part of the ex-
penses of Government, but an outlay of money
for  the benefit of after years, and of posterity.
11.   Permanent public buildings is another of the
laige items of recent e*penditure. Formerly these
buildings were of peti<hable materials, and sunk
under the decay of time, or the ravages of fire;
for some years past durable materials had been
selected, and fireproof edifices constructed. The
expenditure for this purpose in 1839, was $1,248,-
044, and near the same for the three proceeding
years. This again was an expenditure for ihe
benefit of posterity, and not chargeable as an ex-
pense upon the aciual administrations.
12.  The sum of $735,570 for bridges and forti-
fications, was the twelfth item which Mr B. pointed
out for deduction, being both of them expenditures
for the benefit of posterity; the expenditure extra-
ordinary and temporary, but the benefit general
and permanent.
13.  The sum of $1,491,000 for the improvement
of rivers, harbors, and roads, exclusive of the Cum-
berland road, was another expenditure of the same
character. In 1824, it was but $56,955; but took
a start then which would have known no bounds
had it not been for the Maj sville veto.
14.  Providing arms for the militia of the States
and cannon for the forts is another expenditure for
future times and for posterity. It amounted to
$474,906 for 1839, and averaged above half a
million a year for each of the three preceding years.
In 1824, it was but $171,155.
15.  Pensions, except those to invalids, was the
next item noted by Mr. B. for deduction. They
were gratuit es from the Treasury, and not an ex-
pense of Government. They amounted in 1839
to $3,033 764, b ing near .three times what they
were in 1824. They had been an enormous drain
upon the Treasury for the last seven years,amounting
in 1833 to $4,485,000, and subsequently averaging
about half that sum.
16.  Purchase of lands from Indians was another
large item to be deducted, and which had vastly
increased of late. In 1824, thi"¡ head of expendi-
ture onlv amounted to $429,987; in 1839 it was
$1,708,123; in 1836 was as hi?h as three millions,
in 1837, $2,484,000; and in 1838, it was $4,603,513;
These were heavy expenditure*, incurred for the
great object of relieving all the States from the
incumbrance of an Indian population; but though
heavy, it is not money gone from the Treasury
never to return to it. It all returns, and with pro-
fit, in the sale of the -lands acquired; yet the vast
sums paid on this head, is cited against us as ruin-
ous extravagance, for which the Goths should be
driven from the Capitol!
17.  Removal of Indians and their wars was
another item nearly connected with tha last, and
