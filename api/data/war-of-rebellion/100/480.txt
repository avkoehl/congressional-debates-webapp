Major General J. C. DAVIS,

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you move your corps to-day to a church about six miles from Hanover Court-House, at which place the roads fork, the left-hand road leading toward Chilesburg and Raccoon Ford. The road to this point is not very bad, and you can probably reach here without much difficulty.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLONEL: The last of General Morgan's train has just crossed the pontoon. The water is rising rapidly, and I am hurrying my wagons across as rapidly as possible. I may have to move the bridge; hope not. It will take until 12 or 1 o'clock to get my command across.

Yours, &c.,

Brigadier-General.
