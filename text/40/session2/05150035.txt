Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
matiers by an officer of large experience,
merits especial attention. The reports of the
other bureau officers are also of unusual inter-
est and value.
The work upon the public buildings through-
out tlie country has been prosecuted with un-
usual energy. It has been the aim of the super-
vising architect, under the direction of the
Secretary, to have all public buildings con-
structed in the most substantial manner and
completed, with a view to economy, as rap-
idly as possible. The rapidity with which
the north wing of the Treasury is approach-
ing completion must be gratifying to Con-
gress.
The Department of State has referred to this
Department for consideration the official report
of the proceedings of "the international mone-
tary conference'' held at Paris in June and
July of the present year, and also the report
of Mr. Samuel B. Knggles, the delegate in
that conference from the United States of
America. This conference was diplomatic in its
constitution, having been formally called by the
Government of France by official invitations to
most of the civilized nations. Its object, as
stated by the minister of France at Washing-
ton, was a general interchange of views, and
also "to seek for a basis for ulterior negoti-
ation" on the subject of a unified coinage for
the use of the world. It appears by the official
report that the conference, 011 full deliberation,
has agreed on such a basis, which is now trans-
mitted to the different nations for their consid-
eration and decision respectively. The matters
thus presented are of high monetary interest to
the United States, and merit the attentive and
careful examination of its public authorities,
executive and legislative. They are fully dis-
cussed in the separate report of Mr. Ruggles
under the following heads:
1. The composition and character of the
conference, embracing nineteen separate na-
tions, with a population of 320,000,000 inhab-
itants.
2. The importance of including in the pro-
posed monetary reform the nations of Central
and South America.
3. The necessity of monetary union between
the eastern and western continents.
4. The intermediate position of the two
Americas between Western Europe and East-
ern Asia, and their duty as the principal pro-
ducers of tbe gold of the world.
5. The cost of recoinage required by the
proposed unification, with full statistics of the
coinage, past and present, of the United States,
Great Britain, and France.
The gold coinage of the United States, from 1792 to
1851, the report states to have been.... $180,18-1,208
Of Great Britain, from 1810 to 1851  480,105,755
Of France, Irom 17'j;J to 1851  324,492,516

From 1851 to 1SGG (fifteen yeais) there was coined by
the United States  $005,352,023
Great Britain    455,225,695
Prance  9S7.788.298
$2,108,350,316
6. The probable rate of future product of
gold in the United States.
7 and 8. The history of the varying coinages
of Europe and their gradual consolidation.
- 9. The contrast presented by the coinage of
the United States, as unified by the Constitu-
tion.
10. The necessity of intercontinental mone-
tary conferences of nations. First attempt in
the congress at Berlin in 1863.
11. Quadripartite monetary treaty of Decem-
ber, I860, between France, Belgium, Switzer-
land, and Italy, with subsequent adhesion of
the Pontifical States and of Greece, partially
unifying Europe.
12. The necessity of a single standard exclu-
sively of gold. The fallacy and impossibility
of a double standard of gold and silver.
13. A "common denominator," or unit, of
gold of denned weight and value, rendering
"dollars" and "francs" synonymous or mu-
tually convertible.
14. A ction in the conference by the delegates
from Great Britain.
15. The consent of France to issue a new
gold coin of twenty-five francs to circulate side
by side with the half-eagle of the United States
and the sovereign of Great Britain when re-
duced to that value.
The proper examination of a subject so com-
prehensive can hardly fail to benefit the Gov-
ernment and the people of the United States.
In commending the report to the due consid-
eration of Congress the Secretary deems it suf-
ficient for the present to express his full con-
currence in the view of public duty embodied
in the following extract:
"Let us never forget that the two Americas arc
Christian members of the great family of nations,
and that the unification of money may be close akin
to other and higher objects of Christian concord. We
cannot wisely or rightfully remain in continental
isolation. Integral portions of the mighty organism
of modern civilization, let us ever fraternally and
promptly take our part in tho world-wide works of
peace."

Secretary of the Treasury.

Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
November 20, 1867.
Slit: The revenues of the Department during
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1807, were
$15,237,026 87, to which should be added
amounts drawn from the Treasury under the
acts making appropriations for carrying "free
mail matter," $900,000, and amounts under
the special appropriations for overland mail
and marine service between New York and
California, $000,000; steamship service between
San Francisco, Japan, and China, ยง41,066 67;
and between the United States and Brazil,
$250,000, (including $100,000 on account of
service performed during the previous fiscal
year;) for new mail routes, $150,000; and to
supply deficiencies, $1,500,000; making the
receipts from all sources $10,978,093 54. The
expenditures of all kinds, including the foreign
mail transportation, and service for which the
above special appropriations were made, say
$1,191,606 67, during the same period, were
$19,235,483 40, showing an excess of receipts
over expenditures of $743,210 08.
The ordinary expenses of the Department,
not including mail transportation provided for
by special appropriation, were $18,043,816 79;
and the ordinary receipts, including the amount
drawn under appropriation for carrying free
mail matter, were $16,137,026 87, showing an
excessof expendituresof$l,906,789 92, which
has been met by the unexpended balances of
former appropriations. No appropriation for
the past year is therefore needed.
The receipts for postages, as compared with
the previous year, show an increase of six per
cent., and the expenditures an increase of
twenty-five and three tenths per cent. The
amount of revenue concentrated in the depos-
itories and draft offices was $0,164,728 16;
collected by the Auditor, $2,197,113 66; re-
tained by postmasters for compensation and
office expenses, $6,314,156 55; and remain-
ing in the hands of postmasters awaiting collec-
tion, $561,028 50.
The details of the financial operations of
tho Department are fully set forth in the
accompanying comprehensive report of the
Auditor:

cisco, Jap^n, and China  500,000

POSTAGE STAMPS ANI> STAMPED ENVELOPES.
During tbe year 371.599,605 postage stamps,
of the value of $11,578,607 ; 44,560,150 plain
stamped envelopes, representing$l,290,588 50;
16,062,750 stamped envelopes bearing printed
cards and requests, representing $494,712 50;
and 1,857,750 newspaper wrappers, valued at
$37,155, were issued. An aggregate value of
$13,401,063.
'The issue of postage stamps, compared with
the previous year shows an increase of about
0.5 per cent., while the issue of stamped
envelopes has increased almost sixty-one per
cent. This increase is attributable to the in-
troduction of printing business cards and
requests for return if not delivered, without
additional cost. The issue of this class of
envelopes during the year was increased one
hundred and six per cent, over that of 1866.
The prediction in last year's report that the
use of such envelopes would tend largely to
reduce the number of dead letters has been
verified. The statistics elsewhere given, under
the head of dead letters, show that the number
has diniished nearly one million during the
past year, and that this gratifying result is at-
tributable to the use of envelopes with a request
for the return to the writers ot unclaimed let-
ters directly from the post office addressed. It
is estimated that fully fifty million of these
envelopes were used during the year, the De-
partment supplying about one third of the
number. The sales of postage stamps and
stamped envelopes during the year amounted
to $12,988,134 32, leaving unsold in the hands
of postmasters $412,928 78.
New Postage Stamps.
Experiments are in progress with a postage
stamp printed on embossed paper, whiehseems
to afford good security against fraud, lhe
fibers of the paper being broken, canceling
marks almost necessarily penetrate, so that
they cannot easily be removed without destroy-
ing the stamp. The adhesive properties are
