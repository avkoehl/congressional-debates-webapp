1836.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
421
After some remarks from Messrs. PRES-
TON , BLACK, BUCHANAN .WEBSTER, and
MANGUM—
Mr PRESTON withdrew his motion; and the
motions ot Messrs. Blvck and BrcHANAN conse-
quently fill with it.
Mr MWGUM moved to amend the bill by
staking out the appropriation of $340,000 for the
contingent expensts of the courts of the United
StHic;, which i he siid) was extravagant and un-
n'oos^aiv . and insert ¿140,000
Vfter so no opposition from Mr WEBSTER,
this nmendniMit was reacted
On motion of Mr EWING, of Ohio, the bill
was amended bv inserting an appropriation for
the survey of lands lately acquired fiom the In-
dians in the Wisconsin Terntoiv.
The amendment of the committee was then
concurred in; and the bill was reported to the
Senate; when
Mr KING, of Georgia, moved to amend it by
striking out the appropriation of $00,000 for the
Documentary History of the Revolution now in
progress by Matthew St. Clair Clark and Peter
Force
Mr BENTON hoped that the motion to strike
out this appropriation would prevail. He was
rejoiced to see the Senator from Georgia persist-
ing in the good work, and he would enlist with
him for the war. They had already paid $20,000
for this work without seeing a page of it; and
that, he thought, was enough to break up this
improper contract. He thought that this work
was stopped two years ago; but now it seemed
that mon money was asked for it. His attention
had been called to some remarks made in relation
to this work the other day, in the House of Rep-
nscntatives, which he would now read for the
benefit of the Senate.
[Here Mr. Bentov read some remarks made
by Mr. Johvsok, of Tennessee ]
That gentleman stated, in his place, that there
was a bill brought in to print this work at eight
dollars per volume; and that it was rejected by
the House on account of the price; yet, at the
succeeding session, another bill was brought in,
which was hurried through almost without notice,
at the heels of the session, giving $13 50 for this
same work. The gentleman further informed
him that, on searching among the files of the
House .for this manuscript bill that had been thus
rejected, they found the bills immediately before
and after it, but that bill could not now be found.
All this showed that the contract had been ob-
tained in an improper manner.
I am to receive (said Mr. B ) $252 worth of
this work, while the gentleman from New Jersey
[Mr Wall] who sits on my right, is to receive
nothing. At least one half of those who were
now members of Congress would get no copies,
while those who were members of the Twenty-
Second Congress would get them, or, if they
should not now be delivered, they would be given
to thcr cx"cutor^. Two years ago (said Mr. B.)
we struck out this thing, and the next morning
it was reinstated. This session it was struck out
in the House of Representatives, and the next
morning it was in like manner reinstated. Night
work, sir—night work, (said Mr. B.,) what was
done in the morning was undone at night.
The extent to which this work was carried was
a great abuse. The contract was got through for
a work professing to be a documetary history
of the Revolution, and they had got matter as far
back as the settlementof the Pilgrims; while they
had to pay double as much as the work could be
printed for anywhere else. He hoped the appro-
priation would be struck out. Everything that
these gentlemen had been compiling would be
found in the library of Congress or in the library
of the Department of State, so that the compilers
had not been put to much trouble in making their
collections. He was for putting a stop at once to
the work; and if the compilers could show that
they were damnified, he would readily agree to
pay them, and pay then liberally.
Mr. SOUTHARD said, that when a contract
had been made, and the work commenced under
it, it then would be a violation of the principles
of justice in refusing to go on with it. This was
an appropriation bill for items allowed by law;
*nd while the contra'-t stood, it did not seem to
him to be honest to withhold payment. If there
wps anything wrong in the matter, the proper
\va\ wou'd be to lot a resolution of inquiry be
offered, and a committee of investigation ap-
pointed. But when a contiact was made for a
work to be published, they could not íefuse an
appropriation to complete it. The Senator from
Missouri had made charges upon mere allega-
tions
Mr. BENTON remarked that he had based
his charges upon what a membci had said in his
place on the floor of Congress.
Mr. SOUTHARD. The Senator, then, rests
his charges upon the allegation of what a mem-
ber of the other House had said in his place,
although the House of Representatives had passed
the bill in the face of the statement of that mem-
ber. He would be unwilling, for his part, to pro-
ceed in any case on such evidence alone. He
would first ask for the evidence, before he could
do what he was here asked to do. Did it (he
asked) dissolve them from the contract because
the work was worthless' The inquiry whether
the work was worth the continuation of its pub-
lication would be proper enough. But when the
Secretary of State made the contract, it was in
t'ie power of Congress either to confirm or reject,
but they confirmed i . He gave no opinion of
the value of the work at present He spoke of the
importance of preserving the recoids of the eaily
history of our country, and to do which he cared
nothing about the expense. He was not willing
that the Senate, at a single jump, should violate
the rights of parties, bul, with the Senator from
Massachusetts, [Mr. Webster,] he was willing
that a committee should be appointed to inquire
into the matter.
[At the close of Mr. Soutiivrd's remarks, a
sample cf the work under discussion was handed
to several of the Senators ]
Mr. HILL «¡aid  he did  not wish to consume
the time of the Senate to throw any obstacle in
way of the passage of the appropriation bill; but
to prevent an improvident contract being fastened
upon the nation, it was indispensable that the
item of $20,000 towards the publication of the
work of Messrs. Clark & Force should be stricken
! out; if that item was retained we would hereafter
i have no hope that an immense expenditure would
be avoided.                                   •
1     The Senator from Missouri had said that the
original bill which authorized this expenditure
had passed without the attention of anybody.
The Senator was under a mistake; and he (Mr.
H ) would refer to the Senate Journal of 1833 to
Crove the fact. On the 27th Februaiy, three days
efore the close of the session, three propositions
of immense jobs of printing were brought up at
the same time. Eich of these propositions, as
were many others of a like tenor, was reported
and recommended by the Libraiy Committee,
who had always been exclusively of one political
party. Reports from that committee had usually
been made in whispers, in so low a tone of voice
that it had been impossible for him (Mr. H.)
to hear them when they were made; but all three
of these propositions for printing had attracted
his attention when they came up for a third read-
ing. The first proposition was for a continuation
of Gales & Seaton's compilation of State papers,
extending that work eight volumes, and involving
an expense to the Treasury of ¿63,000. Mr.
Foote, the late Senator from Connecticut, was
then in the chair, and I called for the yeas and
nays to be taken on the question. The attention
of so few was called to the subject, and the ques-
tion was so hurried by the Chair, that one fifth
1 of the Senate failed to respond to the call I then
made. Then, almost in the same breath, came
up for consideration the bill to provide for the
publication of a stereotype edition of the laws of
the United States, by Duff Green. Although his
proposition was nearly double the price at which
the same work had been offered by several other
printers, it was passed by a vote of twenty-five
to seven. On tins proposition, which involved
an expenditure of at least $125,000,1 was able to
obtain the yeas and nays, and six other Senators
voted with me against the bill. Then succeeded
immediately the bill making provision for the
publication of the Documentary History of the
Revolution, by Messrs. Clark & Force; and on
the question of its passage, my call for the yea 
and nays was not sustained by one fifth of the
Senator sprescnt—the occupant of the cha  hur-
rying the decision, and evincing little disposition
to gi itify my wish to ascertain who was in favor
of, and who against, this extravagant expenditure
for public printing This third resolution, at the
minimum calculation, involved an expendituie
of about $500,000—it may amount to two or four
millions; nay, there is no limit to it; the pub-
lication may include everything connected with
the time of the Revolution.
It is worthy of remark, (continued Mr. H.)
that all these extravagant projects for printing
have bepn in favor of one side of the question
exclusively. The three propositions to which I
have adverted embraced each branch of the op-
position. Gales & Seaton were to have a fat job,
and Duff Green's friends insisted that he should
have one also. When the proposition came to be
considered in the House of Representatives on
the last night of the session, Gales & Seaton's
and Clark & Force's bill passed—both belonging
to and including one branch of the opposition.
Duff Green's proposition to stereotype the laws
and tieatie3 failed, thus disappointing the other
branch of the opposition Bat this disappoint-
ment was made up at the beginning of the next
session, (1834,) by a resolution of a lato Senator
fiom Mississippi, (Mr. Poindexter,) autliouzina
the publication of land documents, which also
passed without attracting sufficient attention of
the Senators to call for a division of the question—
probably when not a half a dozen Senators heard
the resolution read. The execution of this meas-
ure has involved an expenditure of $57,327, to be
paid from the contingent fund of the Senate;
and the result is the publication of five folio vol-
umes, sixteen hundred copies each, or eight thou-
sand volumes in the whole—a lumber, which has
been proved to be of no use to every nine hundred
and ninety-nine in a thousand of the people of
the United States—a publication so useless as
really not to be worth the price of transport for
membeis carrying it home, and which now in-
cumbers the rooms of the Capitol Three of
these folios were but a reprint of the very docu-
ments published by Gales & Seaton, and they
were twice printed, in the same year, at the public
expense.
The price of the proposed publication is said
to be J13 63 per volume—about twice as much as
the price of Congress printing; and this Congress
printing is much higher than the prices of print-
ing in all our principal towns. This matter of
printing is alleged to be a small afftir, not worthy
of the attention of Senators. Although it is a
subject of little interest here, it may be interesting
elsewhere, to look into the expenditures for pub-
lic printing at this point. From a report of the
Secretary of the Senate, made at the commence-
ment of the present session, I have taken the
footings of the several years of the public print-
ing, which I will present:

By this statement, it will be seen that the ex-
pense of printing for the Senate has been multi-
plied twenty times, and that of the House ten
times' The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Cut]
had reproached the Administration for its " utter
and reckless extravagance," and taunted it with
its failure in making " retrenchment and reform.
The extravagant expenditures by the Senate and
House of millions for public printing could not
be charged on the Administration or its fneod*—
