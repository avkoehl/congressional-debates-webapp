Captain FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following dispatch just received from Colonel Simonton:

The enemy are reported landing in some force at Battery Island, and a transport is coming up with troops. The enemy has been shelling furiously. It may be well to send more troops here. I will advise you from time to time.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, May 23, 1864-5.45 p. m.

Captain FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A courier reports that our pickets have fallen back to the point occupied yesterday, and says they cannot hold it. This has not been officially communicated, however.

Brigadier-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, May 23, 1864-6 p. m.

(Received 6.45 p. m.)

Captain FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I wish to create no exaggerated impression of the enemy's force. I cannot tell what it will be. The pickets are now fighting at Grimball's Causeway. I think the troops had better come.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

ROYALL'S, May 23, 1864-8 p. m.

Captain FEILDEN, Assistant Adjutant-General;

The last report just received from the pickets is that the enemy has not advanced to the main island. The musketry firing was from Dixon's and the lower end of the peninsula, at a point supposed to be held by our pickets, who had retired. The last firing of the bun-boats was a heavy shelling of John's Island. Cannot a torpedo-boat be sent down? I have urged that torpedoes be placed in the Stono at the obstructions and elsewhere. If this can be done it will be very important. Boats were seen late this evening from the Secessionville observatory passing over troops from Long to Dixon's Island.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
