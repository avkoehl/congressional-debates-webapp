Major-General BUTLER:

I cannot take 4,000 men out toward the railroad. I think that it will be very necessary to put a strong force near Howlett's house to guard the flank and rear of the force sent out, and I think can safely withdraw from the intrenchments only between 4,000 and 5,000 good troops. I will feel of the enemy and push back his rear guard until I hear from you again.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, June 16, 1864.

General TERRY:

The commanding general named 4,000 troops, excepting that would be enough to make the demonstration on railroad and cover flanks. Start a column of 4,000 or as many as you can, to push at once to railroad. If this movement is made quickly the enemy will not be in position to interfere with it, at least until considerable damage is done road.

By direction of General Butler:

Respectfully,

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

General TERRY:

Turner is now on railroad at junction, tearing it up with about 500 men. General Butler suggests that you look well to your right, and send part of your men to support of Turner, as the road well destroyed at one place is better than to poorly destroy it in several places. By this course you can cover your right, and effectually destroy the road near where Turner now is. Make complete work of it. So far you have done splendidly. The general has just notified General Grant that your forces are on the road.

Respectfully,

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: Ames and Foster both reached the turnpike, Foster near the junction of the Chester road, Ames at a point some distance to the south. Foster immediately became engaged with the enemy and a sharp skirmish ensued. It soon became apparent to him that the enemy were in force. I therefore halted Ames at the turnpike, but after awhile directed him to send forward a picked party of men to tear up the railroad. Shortly after this order was given General Foster
