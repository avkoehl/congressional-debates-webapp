cartridges, and about 140 rounds for each of our five cannon, two of which are rifled. I want at least 200,000 musket cartridges; caliber .69; 20,000 Enfield cartridges, caliber .57; 10,000 ditto, caliber .58; 50,000 cartridges for the Greenwood altered rifle, bright barrels; 200 rounds each James solid shot and James shells, and 300 each of grape and canister for smooth-bore, with 150 solid shot, all for 6-pounders. Extra caps for muskets, 30,000; also 1,000 friction-primers for cannon. If a persistent defense is to be made here we should want much more than the above, and it should be where we could easily get it.

GAULEY BRIDGE, August 15, 1861.

General ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

A message just received from Summersville informs me that reports of the meditated attack on the part of the enemy have induced the whole force to move to Cross-Lanes, near the mouth of Meadow Creek, nine miles this side of Summersville. I shall immediately send a message urging them to carry out their former instructions unless it is absolutely impossible. Captain Sprague, of Seventh Regiment, had been taken prisoner in endeavoring to communicate with Weston. I have advised that the Thirteenth and Twenty-third should return to Summersville at once, and if attacked from the direction of Lewisburg by a large force to retire slowly on Sutton; or if attacked from the north to retire slowly this way, in either case obstructing the advance of an enemy as much as possible.
