Mr. Chaisraaii, we do not realize Mir dangeiuu- < ohm quencea to
result fiom the disoidered condition ol the money system
Derangement of thecuirency, loss of confilence and ciedit is
the hinge upon which many revo^ttoris hi\e turnel m ciu-
lizedcountries It is well known that the denngei íent oi ihe
ftftances, and de8tiuction of public inS privase uulu, wa* the
immediate cause ol that revolution in I i mce winch deiuged
that country with blood At aneaiiydayan inquired ion uc
cuned in the State of Massachusetts and in my own Stare, not
more than ten or twelve years ago aner we had uea id nume
ious banks, the creditors aud debtors hail a most angiy conflict,
and after relief law?, judge breaking and a tempoiary war
upon our judiciary, the people of that S aie were brought to
the Tergeof civil war On no condition of the State ought we
to look with more deep concern than a disordeied titeof the
monetary system. There are no duties of moie paramount
obligation on the Congress of the United Sute*, than to exercise
all the powers granted them by the Constitution, to restore
a sound and healthy action to that cimency which rogulites
the transactions of the people To pieseive union estabht.lt
justice, and ensure domestic tranquillity, are among the leading
objects of the Federal compact
Mr Chairman, said Mr Pope, another unmeaning and com
p'exnotion is tobe presented to the nation to uconcile them
to this new and dangerous pioject They are t<> be amused
with th* cant phiase that Government ou*ht t« be divorced
fiom the banks, and the people, who have bised all then nans
actions on the local banks and the cuiiewy iurmshed by them,
ire to be abandoned to shift for themselves under the dumn
ciation and slanders of the Government—that same Govern
rnent that brought, many of these banks into existence, and
assured th° people they were to be confided m, and that they
vo-ild furnish a bettei currency, and do the bu&mess of ex
uta ige on better terms, or as good, and moie extensively, than
the Bank of the United States ever hid And thn language was
h Id by the Admrntstiation up to the 4th of March la-.t, when
ihi. late President, m his farewell addiess, only about eight
wteks before the banks all suspended spvcie payments, ftom
rinses to which I have bnefly advened, tnnounced to the
nition that all was well m íegaid to oui hanks and cmrency
Ii those placed by the people of this countiy at the head of
public affairs, for theh supposed wisdom and patriotism, could
not foresee the fatal catastrophe which was to occui in eo
short a time, how can they criminate with such wanton and
unfeeling cruelty the conduct of the banks which hid followed
thUt counsels? Tor, sir, I hive now before me the lettei of
^euítary Taney to the deposite banks, after the removal oí
tin leposites, in which he exhous the State banks to expand
ili ¡i Hsue", and to be liberal in theiraccommodations to the

In loo1 lis lit the past and piesent cotuse of things, I am led
backhaul Mi P mt) i > the i'iscu^ ions in the Vngmia Conven
tion of this Constitution, between Patiuk Henry, thefir^toiitoi
of ancient or mot'er* times, and one that looked through i he
deeds of men, and the late Mr Ma lison, among the most viitu
oifs ind enlightened s atesmen m Ameiica Mr Madison could
not believe that any Pit*identw uld íemove a goo 1 ofheer
without reason ible cause, and supposed that the poweis of Go
veinment were ^u ananaed and divided that theie could be no
undue or dmgerius iceumulation in any depaitment Mr
Heniy, with piophetic vision, at the sime time that he bestow
ed a merited eulog'um on the virtues and intelligence of Mr
Madison, said m emphatic terms that, imfoitun-uety foi himsell,
and unfortunately lot his eounuy, he had been bred up in the
dark closets o( study, and knew nothing of mankind Sn, said
Mr Henry whatevei othcib may think howevei they mayad
mue tfus OoftMAUiunn to me it, has in awful squinting towirdb
monarchy Mi Heniy had studied human natuie thoroughly,
and explored, witn an eye of a waiy statesman, all the <-eciet
springs ol humin acimn^ and foresaw, or thought he foi esa w,
a strong tendency in ths Government to concentiate too much
strength m the Lvecume head, and piedicted that at no distant
day he would be raw absolute in fact, if not in form, than
any monauh on the Bnti^h thinne since the levolution oí
1088 Mi ( han mm, (said M Pope,) from what I have ob
stivtd within a tew years past, 1 fear Ml Henry s piedictions
wiP be fulfilled, unless every mm who thinks this iiee system
is woith pieservmg will stand forth and contribute hi-> mite to
check tins tendency to prostrate all othei departments at the
feet of the Cxecu ive
I know, said Mi Pope that many gentlemen cilculate that
this cant phiasc of divoiceGoveinmeiu from tanks is to cany
the in triumphantly throush the pending struggle, but if they
mount this pcttv, pnoi hobby, they will %oon fin i themselves
cast into msi£mfj<"wee They rely too much ontheeieduhty
of the peop e,and undei rate their intelligence In piosperous
times when they feci, said Mr Popej no distie«s oi suffering
fi m the measures of the Administration, they cannot be easi
ly routed to íesist eirei, but m times like the present, gentle
men may be assured th it the whole intellect and eneigy ot the
people will he brought into action to vindicate their rights and
interests
1 he respect I hive, said Mr Pope, for mmy gentlemen who
ta k ibt ut adivoxcb of the Government from all banks induces
nie to examine moie gravely than might seem to be nece^iry
oi propei the natuie and chaiaciei ol this divoice Ihe par-
tics to be divoiced are the Government on the one part and the
buiks and I would add said Mr Pope, the people, on the other
put Now Mr, what isthe Government, the paity on the~first
put? It j« Mi Chiirmm, il lundeistaid the matter, the States
ind pt.opk u ting ht-ie in all the dep utmt ntshy agent , this is
a Government of the people and htates, who are at present
acting by ^lecie 1 igent«, m one branch, the States acting by
agents seiet ted by them in then coipoi ate capacity Now, su,
what aie the banks of the fctates but money coiporattons, created
by the States, fiunishtn? hank money oi currency for the peo
pteol the States, and solemnly made by this Government mo
ney agents of the United States, and furnishing with the sane

people, of the United States'  The stock of some hanks is
owned exclusively by the States, m some the stock is owned in
part by the (state*, and m pait by the people m others the
whole is owned entnely by citizens This divorce, then, if I
con said Mr Pope, compiebcnd the true chatactei of it, is a
sepiiaiion of the States, bmks, ind people, from the States,
tanks, and people Then is something so obscuie and piepos
tetous m the piopositnui advanced, tint the Government of the
mtion flight to sevi r itself fiom the Stales and people, antl

an ellort to conect the eul, that I am at a lo°s foi an argu

I to understand gentlemen, said Mr Pope, that the existing cur

men, whofme not sought the post of honoi at the expense of

measures essential to maintain ciedit and eoi fidente^nd pio
tect the greatspunss ol the puhlic piospemy How different
is thelanauase held bv the Admimstiationof public affairs m
this country, said Mi P from thatheMby the Administration
of Gieit Britain and the Whigs of that counliy In the yeai
1793 when the people of that countiy were overwhelmed with
difficulties and embanassments, and the commercial ci edit was
in danger, the Government stepped forwaid with a kind and
aidn g hand, and arrested the luin and desolation which seemed
to be impending
In 1797, when the Rank ofFngland suspended specie payment,
anda panic sei7ed the nation the prime mmistei of England,
instead of denouncing the bank, and ordering a commission of
banktuptcy against her, had a committee raised to examine her
affairs, who lepoited, after a full examination of the afTms of
the bank, that the means wei e ample to meet hei engagement«,
and that she wa^ «ound and solvent, that the suspension was
forced on the bank by the uicumstances which surrounded the
country, and the dingers which menaced it
If, Mi Chairman, said Mr P this Government had taken
the sime com se, had an investigation made into the condition of
our banks, md a íepoitofthe same chuacter, so farasmeiited,
made to the nation, with assurance that the Government would
aid them with its ciedit and countenance to íesume specie pay
ment1: they w< uld have maintained with the people confidence
in our institutions, so ímpoitmt in this hmir of alarm and dis
trust, and ii the Piesident in his Message, insteid of denouncing
a national bank, hid declared, like Piesident Madison, that the
State bank expel i mem would not answei without i national
bank, and recommended the measure to the consideration ol
Congress, if he had hurled from him the hobby by which he
rode into powei, and dismounted his followeis, and admitted his
enoi with that magnanimity which becomes the Chief Magis
trafeof i nation he would n ive gained a ci own of public appro
bition worth all the lreisuiy note bill and S\j\> TreasUiy
schemes which I is uige inity can invent m the four years for
winch he was elected In confnmation of the opinion I have
¡ advanced, said Mr Pope, of the duty of this Government to
I give the people a good currency, and guard aeramst a lumous
1 andunstible one, let me cdl your attention to the sentiments
| expressed by the Whigs of England, such as Charles Fox, She
ndan and others, whose lives were devoted to subtam the rights
of the people igamst the usurpatians of the cr^wn
In a protest entered on the journals of the House of Loida in
the year 1797, during the war between England and Trance,
they hold and maintain the following langt age md opinions
The whigs insist, in that protest   that "the advisers of the
down are responsible for the condition of the Slate, repon
sible for its internal peace and genei.il  good Government, for
the protection of its commerce, ¡t« creiliij indriie\ano\is sour
ces of its prospei ity and wealth "   And Mr   Chairman, (said
Mr P ) 1 concur with Tox, fcheudan, and other whigs of Eng
land, whosehves were devoted to the mamtenince ol the pow
ers and pnvileges of Parliament igamst the encroachments
ind ustnpations of the Ciown, ihit those chai sed with the aú
mimstiation of this or any othei Government, are lesponsible
for the condition of the Stite, and for the piotection of its com
merco and ciedit, and that no Administration cin ovad* that re
sponibility with honor or aregaid to pub icdutv    Aecoiding
to the express pi o visions of our Constitution, md the funda
mental law inherent in every political assoennon, tlwe placed
in authority are undei the most impt nous and ¿acred oblisra

true, (slid Mr P ) that technically and strictly speaking, noth
