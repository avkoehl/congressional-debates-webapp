General HUMPHREYS:

We were attacked by a pretty heavy force, but repulsed it. I have just learned that General Gibbon, who is on the extreme left of General Hancock, is withdrawing. I shall withdraw into my old line, which is the only way I can now see of protecting my right at all. I have ordered all my artillery, trains, and hospitals on the south side of the creek.
