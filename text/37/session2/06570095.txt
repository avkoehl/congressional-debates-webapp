APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

37th Gong....2d Sess.
I know the great power and influence of the
press. 11 is great for good, and great for evil, too.
No man who would leave the legacy of a good
name to his children can be insensible to its at-
tacks. To every public man, in trying times like
these, it is grateful to the heart to know that his
course is approved by his countrymen, at least
that it is not misrepresented by the press of his
own political friends.
Sir, I have no money with which to purchase its
favors, to pension correspondents, or pay for tel-
cgraphicdispatches—those purchased encomiums
so often and so unworthily bestowed, by which
great men and heroes are manufactured here,
sometimes of very small and v<#y poor material;
and if I had the gold of California, I would not
humiliate myself to make the purchase.
And I now say, once forall, I ask nothing of the
press but the truth, and I take all the responsibil-
ity of my opinions, my action, and my votes.
But, Mr. President, I come now to the issue
made with me by the honorable Senator from New
Hampshire, [Mr. Hale,] in his speech yesterday
on the subject of the possible colonization of the
increase of the colored population of the United
States. He more than once denounced coloni-
zation as a thing impossible, impracticable, and
absurd, one of " the most absurd ideas that ever
entered into the head of man or woman." Among
other things he said:
"The great laws of nature and of Providence will goon.
One of the laws or" the condition ot this class is, tUatthey
increase faster than the whiter. They have jnciea eii.
They aie to-day vastly exceeding in numbei the whole Uni-
ted States when they bade defiance to the powei of the
mightiest kingdom of the earth. They are here, and depute
all >oui puny eftotts they will lemam here. They will in-
crease. They will increase probably in about the latio that
they have increased. It will botliei the wne-t philosophy,
it will pot at nausht even the philanthropy ami wisdom of
my Irieud tioin Wisconsin [,Mi. Doolittle] to meet it with
any schemes looking to colonization in Genual Ameiica,
South Amenta, oi uls-uwhi'ie."
He admitted that it might elevate the condition
of a few, but stoutly denied that it could remove,
in any possible degree, this black population, or
materially retard their increase.
I stated yesterday that, as the Seilator from
New Hampshire was coming down to facts and
figures, 1 desired to meet him. I then thought I'
might not occupy more than ten minutes in reply
to him on this subject; but as my honorable friend
from New York, [Mr. Harris,] to whom the
floor would be assigned to>day, is detained by
sickness, I will ask the indulgence of the Senate
while I shall state the facts and figures a little
more in detail than I expected to do last evening.
Mr. President, I regret exceedingly that the
honorable Senator from New Hampshire, after
the usual motion made by him on Friday to ad-
journ over Saturday until Monday, is not now
present in the Senate. I should be glad if he were
here, especially aftergivinghim notice last evening
as I did, that as he was coming down to history,
geography, arithmetic, and figures, I desired to
cipher with him a little on tills question. It is
not very often that I have an opportunity to meet
that honorable gentleman'upon equal terms. In
the matter of rhetoric, figures of speech, wit and
humor; in that magnetic power of voice and man-
ner which can change at once from the grave and
serious to the humorous and joyous; which al-
most at the same moment can dissolve us in
tears and convulse us withlaughter; in that power
of declamation which he knows so well how to
use, to influence the minds and move the passions
of mankind, I am by no means the equal of the
honorable SenatorfiomNew Hampshire. I yield
to his gicat superiority at once. But, sir, when
we come down to fasts and figures, when 1 can
be permitted to bring him to the blackboard, when
I can be permitted to open the book of history,
take down the map of the world, and look at ge-
ography and climate and men and races, then I
feel that I can meet the honorable Senator from
New Hampshire on equal terms. As 1 have him
there now, I propose to cipher at the blackboard,
even in his absence, as Igave him notice lasteven-
ing I desiied to cipher with lnm on this question
to-day. It is my purpose to confine myself to the
great issue between us: is the colonization of a
number equal to or greater than the annual increase
of the colored population to tropical countries,
first of all,
Emancipation—Mr. Doolittle.
Senate.
A THING POSSIBLE?
I propose to look into the tables and see what
that annual increase is. I have before me a table
carefully prepared by the chief of the Census Bu-
reau. In looking into that you will find what I
have briefly abstracted, showing the rate percent,
of increase, in columns, during each decade pre-
cedingtheyearmentioned in the column of years,
as follows:

In the decade ending in 1800, that is for the ten
years between 1790 and 1800, the increase of
whites was 35.G8 per cent.; the increase of slaves
27.97 per cent.; the increase of free colored per-
sons 82.28 per cent.; the total increase of popu-
lation 35.02 per cent. During that period manu-
missions were very extensive. Prom 1800 to
1810, the increase of whites was 36.18 per cent.,
of slaves 33.40 per cent., (but during most of this
period the slave trade went on, and we acquired
Louisiana and its slaves,) and of the free colored
people 72 per cent.; total increase 36.45 percent.
Prom 1810 to 1820, the inctease of the whites was
34.11 per cent., of slaves 28.79 per cent., (we ac-
quired Florida about 1819, with its slaves,) and of
the free eoloied 25.23 per cent.; total, 33.13 per
cent. Prom 1820 to 3830, the increase of the
whites was 34.03 per cent., of the slaves 30.61 per
cent., and of the free colored 30.87 per cent.; to-
tal, 33.49 per cent. For the decade ending in
1840, the increase of the whites was 34.72 per
cent., of the slaves but 23.81 per cent., of the free
colored 20.87 per cent.; total, 32.67 per cent. For
the decade ending in 1850, the mctease of whites
was 37.74 per cent., of slaves 28.82 per cent., (but
during this period Texas was annexed with its
slaves, increasing the rate per cent, of free col-
ored 12.46 per cent.;) total, 35.87 per cent. For
the decade ending in 1860, which hasjustclosed,
the increase of whites was 38.12 per cent., of
slaves 23.38 per cent., of free colored 10.97 per
cent.; total, 35.58 percent. The annual increase,
therefore, of the slave population during the last
decade of ten years has been at the rate of 23.38
per cent., or a little more than 2.3 per cent, an-
nually. The increase of the free colored popu-
lation during the same period often years is 10.97
per cent., being at the rate of a little over one per
cent, per annum, while the increase of the slave
population is 2.3 per cent., almost 2.4 per cent.;
making the annual increase of four millions of
slaves, 93,520. That would be the increase for
the last year of the decade, taking the number of
slaves to be, in round numbers, four millions.
Now, Mr. President, six steamships of a large
class, or indeed one single monster ship like the
Great Eastern, carrying 12,000 passengers, would
take "a number" equal to all the increase of the
slaves in eight trips per annum to Liberia. This
would give about six weeks for the round trip, to
go to Africa and return. Yes, sir; eight trips
only of that one ship, or of the six large class
sleameis I have supposed, would take away the
whole increase. If, instead of going to Africa, those
trips should be made from New York to the island
of San Domingo, which could easily be done semi-
monthly, she alone would carry more than three
times the number of the annual increase of the
4,000,000 of slaves. The six steamships would
do the same.
If instead of being shipped from New York to
San Domingo, they should, in the progress of
events, go from the city of New Oileans to Veia
Cruz, on the coast of Mexico, to Yucatan or Hon-
duras, or from South Carolina and Georgia to
San Domingo, or nearer still, when, m the prog-
ress of events, the island of Cuba shall become,
as it may, like Hayti, the home of the tropical
race, those trips could be made every week, and
this one ship or those six large steamships, making
weekly trips, could carry from the United States
624,000 persons annually. I beg to call the atten-
tion of Senators to these figures. I would that
the Senator from New Hampshire was here at the
blackboard with us now. The ciphers show this
result, that that one ship alone, or the six ships
supposed, could cairy seven times the increase of
this population in the United States every year.
The first year they would carry the increase of
93,520; and in addition to that 520,500, leaving but
3,480,000 of slaves in the United States. The
second year these same trips would carry the in-
crease, which would then only be 81,362, and
besides the increase, would carry 542,638, leaving
but 2,937,362. The third year these same trips
••could carry the increase, which would then be
reduced to only 68,667, and 556,333 besides,
leaving only 2,382,929. The fourth year these
same trips would carry the increase, which would
then be out 55,686, and also carry 568,314, leav-
ing within the United States but ] ,814,605. The
fifth year these same trips would carry the in-
crease, then reduced to 42,411, and besides the in-
crease could carry 571,589, leaving but 1,243,194.
The sixth year the same trips could carry the
increase, then reduced to only 29,061, and besides
the increase, carry 594,939, leaving but 648,255 in
the United States. The seventh year—yes, sir,
the seventh year—this single ship, or these six
steamships of large class which I have supposed,
making weekly trips, could carry not only the
increase, then reduced down to 15,150, only, but
besides the increase could carry 608,850, leaving
less than 40,000 of the slave population within the
United States.
This calculation has been made upon the as-
sumption that colonization commenced at the end
of the last decade when the census was taken.
1 will also avail myself of thu following care-
fully prepared table working out this problem
upon two other suppositions:
In the tables following 1 have* assumed as the
annual number to bedepoi ted, 150,OOOand350,000,
and allowing for the natuial increase of the pop-
ulation remaining, from year to year, I have cal-
culated the progiessive dcciease of the slaves. It
will be seen that, by an annual deportation of
150,000, miscellaneously selected, the last rem-
nant of the slave population would be removed
by the year 1907. At the larger rate of 350,000,
the removal would be complete in 1877. The ag-
gregate number removed by the first supposition
would be 6,470,000, distributed over a period of
forty-five years; by the second it would be
4,920,000 in fifteen years:
