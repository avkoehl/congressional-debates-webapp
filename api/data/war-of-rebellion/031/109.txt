General PARKE:

General Bayard has just returned from a reconnaissance. He was fired upon by a large force-five or six companies of infantry, he says-about 500 yards from the railroad, directly in front of here. The rest of my line in across Deep Run. The infantry and cavalry have communicated with General Sumner. My right corps (Smith's) is in position. Reynolds will be in position in half an hour. Smith's front is more than a mile from the river. Reynolds goes from his left to the river, nearly at right angles to it.

Major-General.
