POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: Captain Grubb returned here half an hour since, and said the enemy were retreating toward the river, but he thought best not to follow. I ordered him immediately back. Since then two of his men have come in who followed the enemy and saw about 100 of them cross. Grubb has lost three or four men; the enemy's loss is not known. They have all doubtless crossed by this time. Becoming alarmed, Grubb is reprehensible for this retiring, and he met my order on the way coming in. I have sent down the infantry as a precautionary movement. I would not advise the sending of any further force. They are supposed to be Mosby's men.

BURTNETE,

Captain.

POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

All quiet on the Potomac. They have all recrossed. Passenger trains east have gone on. Have directed Grubb to remain at river until further orders. Captain Spence's command are now here, but in readiness. He deserves credit for his promptness in the matter. Will return on next freight train, unless otherwise ordered.

BURTNETE.

POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864-3.20 p.m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

SIR: The rebels reported crossing at White's Ferry, and moving toward Frederick, the boatmen say, with a large force. I have sent the Loudoun Rangers to meet them.

B. SPENCE,

Captain, Commanding.

HARPER'S FERRY, October 14, 1864.

Captain SPENCE,

Point of Rocks, Md.:

Move out with all your infantry force to assistance of Captain Grubb. If there are not more than 250 cavalry, you ought to whip them easily.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864-4 p.m.

General STEVENSON:

I moved down the canal to cut them off.

B. SPENCE,

Captain, Commanding.
