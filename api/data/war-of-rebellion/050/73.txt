HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Crawfish Spring, September 18, 1863-12.15 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK:

The general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your 8 p.m. dispatch, and to say so soon as General Thomas' command is out of the way will close up to this place.

Very respectfully,your obedient servant,FRANK S. BOND,

Major, and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Crawfish Spring, September 19, 1863-9.50 a.m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Your note of 9.30 is received. The general commanding does not think you should commit yourself to any considerable movement before we hear from our extreme left. The rumor that the enemy is between Alexander's and Reed's bridges can hardly be true. McCook was at the former place last night, and Colonel Grose's brigade started it that direction nearly two hours ago. The general commanding directs you to reconnoiter thoroughly before moving out in force. Meantime get a good position.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Widow Glenn's, September 19, 1863-1.25 p.m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Davis' division and two brigades of Van Cleve's division have been sent to you. Spare your reserves as much as possible for the decisive movement. A considerable force of rebel cavalry have got into Chattanooga Valley, in our rear. Two brigades of Minty's have been sent after them. How are you progressing?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Widow Glenn's, September 19, 1863-1.45 p.m.

Colonel WILDER,

Commanding Mounted Brigade:

The general commanding directs you to put your command in position in the right of the fighting line, so as to observe the movements of the enemy in that direction and also cover the left flank.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD.
