No. 11. Reports of Lieutenant Godfrey Weitzel, U. S. Corps of Engineers, Chief Engineer Department of the Gulf.

HEADQUARTERS, Baton Rouge, La., August 7, 1862.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of yesterday. Your troops at this place have won a glorious victory. I do not consider that there is the least danger of an attack for the present, because one of the several reconnoitering parties sent out this morning, and which has returned, reports five abandoned caissons on the Greenwell Springs road. We have sent out to bring them in. This indicates a hasty retreat on the part of the enemy. Our forces could not pursue. One-half of the men who left the hospital to fight could not march a mile. The conduct of them men was magnificently glorious. The attack was undoubtedly made upon representations of rebels within our lines that our troops were nearly all sick and demoralized, and General Breckinridge undoubtedly expected, in conjunction with the ram Arkansas, to make a successful dash. It was a complete failure. The ram is blown up. Their troops were repulsed.

General Williams disposed of his forces as follows, viz: The Fourth Wisconsin on the extreme left, on the right bank of Bayou Gross, with two pieces of Manning's battery on the Arsenal grounds, on the left bank of Bayou Gross, to sweep the grounds on the left of the Fourth Wisconsin. The Ninth Connecticut was posted on the right of the Fourth Wisconsin, with two pieces in rear of center and two pieces in rear of the right. All of these pieces were of Manning's battery, and were posted on either side of the knoll in the Government Cemetery.
