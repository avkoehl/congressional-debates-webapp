In regard to political organization in the States of Virginia and North Carolina, I think it is progressing satisfactorily, and probably as rapidly as can be desired. Some little time is necessarily to arrange the broken and scattered clements of society. After all existing orders for the discharge of troops are carried out there will be left a much larger force in this division than is required by existing circumstances. I think it could be safely reduced at least one-half. There is not and cannot be any organized opposition to the authority of the United States, and all matters of local police can be better regulated by the civil than by the military authorities. For a time the military must assist in preserving order and in enforcing proper relations between the freedmen and their former masters, but a very small force will suffice for these purposes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE JAMES,Richmond, Va., June 26, 1865.

Honorable F. H. PEIRPOINT,

Governor of Virginia, Richmond:;

SIR: Permit me to call your attention to the importance of calling an election of municipal officers of this city at the earliest possible period. In the absence of such municipal officers the trial and punishment of criminal offenses devolve upon military officers, most of whom are unaccustomed to, and many of whom are unqualified for such duties. To nearly all they are disagreeable and annoying. Moreover, when compelled to the unwilling performance of duties which are extra-official, and not properly belonging to their profession in time of peace, the same efficiency can not be expected as under different circumstances. Again, it is not desirable that military officers and soldiers should be brought in continual conflict with citizens in time of peace. It weakens the respect of the former for the civil laws, and in the latter creates hostility to the military authority. There is now in Richmond no hostility to the authority of the United States or to the loyal government of the State, and the inhabitants are as capable of managing their own municipal affairs as they will be at any time hereafter. It is therefore proper that the municipal government be reorganized as early as possible, and when re-established the military will render all necessary aid and assistance in enforcing the laws and maintaining order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
