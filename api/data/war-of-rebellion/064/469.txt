COLONEL: I have the honor to send the inclosed copies of telegrams for the information of the major-general commanding.* I have sent orders from all the cavalry to move in the direction of Hickory Plains, and have sent the Sixty-first Illinois Infantry on this morning's train o Brownsville. I have also ordered Graves' brigade, of the Second Division, across the river, to be ready to move on the receipt of further information. I have not heard from Devall's Bluff nor the camp on the prairie since I sent the orders. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. CARR,

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have no information, except that brought in by Captain Lockwood, who returned from scout last night, and who staid with Major Drummond the night before last and part of the day yesterday. Captain Lockwood reports that the pickets were fired upon every few minutes night before last. It is the opinion of all the officers that went out from this regiment, 3 in number, that Shelby is across the White and Little Red Rivers, and also that they have artillery. Your dispatch to Major Drummond has been forwarded.

Lieutenant-Colonel Twenty-second Ohio.

BROWNSVILLE, June 20, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

From the best information that I can get, I do not believe that Shelby has been this side of Bayou Des Arc. He undoubtedly has squads of men this side White River. Do not think he has any considerable part of his force over. Send countersign by morning train.

O. WOOD,

Colonel.
