v/
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 23,
of the Union, as was proposed this morning by the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Pendleton.] That
would obviate, I think, all the confusion of our
present proceeding.
Mr. STEVENS. I do not object to that. I
move that the House resolve itself into the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the stati of the Union,
with the understanding proposed this morning
that the bill be considered aspecial ord r, to take
precedence of all others, and to be considered
until disposed of.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
(Mr. Bp.andegee in the chair.)
The CHAIRMAN. The House is in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union on
Bpuse bill No. 333, to provide a national cur-
rency, secured by a pledge of United States stocks,
and to provide for the circulation and redemption
thereof, which is a special order, taking prece-
dence of all others.
The Cleric road, as follows:
* That there shall bo established in the Treasury Depart-
ment a separate bureau, which shall be charged with the
execution of this and all other laws that may be passed by
Congre&s respecting the issue and regulation of a national
currency secured by United States bonds. The chief offi-
cer of the said bureau shall be denominated the Comptroller
of the Cuirency, and shall be under the general direction
of the Secretary of the Treasury. He shall be appointed
by the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary
of the Treasury, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate; &c.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. I raoveto strike
out the words "on the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Treasury."
Mr. Chairman, I base that amendment upon
article two, section two, of the Constitution, which
provides that the President shall have power to
" nominate, and by and with the advico and con
sent of the Senate, shad appoint embassadors,
other public ministers and consuls, judges of the
Supreme Court, and all other officers of the Uni-
ted States, whose appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be estab-
lished by law: but the Congress may by law vest
the appointment of such inferior officers, as they
think proper, in the Presidentalono, in the courts
of law, or in the heads of Departments." The
power here is to belong absolutely to the Presi-
dent or to the Secretary of the Treasury. There
is no right on the part of Congress to alter the
jurisdiction which the President may have to
make appointments.
Mr. HOOPER, I hope that the amendment
will not prevail.
Mr. STEVENS. I move fo strike out the word
"shall," and to insert in lieu of it the word
"may," so that it will read, "ho may be ap-
pointed by the Picsident," &c. That will not
make the law imperative.
Mr. PitUYN. Is it intended, by using the
word "may" instead of "shall," that the Pres-
ident may carry out e ft is act or suspend its oper-
ations nt his pleasure? I think that the word
"shall" is right.
Mr. STEVENS. If there is any difficulty
about my amendment I withdraw it.
Mr. BROOKS. As I understand the proposi-
tion of the gentleman from Wisconsin, I hope it
wit] be adopted. It is only within a year or two,
or since the commencement of the last session of
Congress, that we began to reverse the whole
financial policy of the Government from 1787, by
taking from the President of the United States the
control of the public-Treasury and giving it to the
Secretary of the Treasury. The gentleman from
Wisconsin proposes that we shall return to the
old policy and the policy of the Constitution, and
let the Piesideut and not the Secretary havcj the
control of the Treasury.
1 have never been able to comprehend, either
in this or some other bill which has been acted
upon by this House, why that wise policy pur-
sued by George Washington and his Secretary,
Aipxander Hamilton, through the whole history
of the United States, should be changed now, and
the President be deprived of his constitutional
power ami of the power given him by precedent,
and the whole power given to the Secretary of the
Treasury. The Piesicient alone is the respons-
ible officer; we have no control over the Secretary
of the Treasury, nor have the people any such
control. It is the President of the United States
who is, has been through our whole history, and
who should be, responsible.
And permit me here to say, not unkindly, I
am utterly unable to comprehend why the Presi-
dent of the United States is distrusted, and there
is taken from him his legitimate control over the
public money; and why in this and in other bills
there is given to the Secretary of the Treasury
that control which ought alone to be in the Pres-
ident of the United States. I am unable to com-
prehend. I have never heard any satisfactory rea-
son given here or elsewhere for that change'of our
public policy. If there be any reason for the
change I should be happy to hear it. But as the
bill now stands it is an expression of distrust on
the part of the House, and upon the part of Con-
gress, if the bill passes through Congress, either
of the capacity or integrity of the President of the
United States to exercise his legitimate and con-
stitutional control over the public money. I say it
is an expression of distrust, and therefore I hope
the amendment of the gentleman from Wf&consin
will prevail.
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. Before the ques-
tion is taken, I desire the Clerk to read the latter
part of article two of the Constitution, in which
is contained the provision in reference to making
appointments.
The Clerk read, as follows:
" He [the Piesidcnt] fhall have power, by and with the
advice anil consent of the Senate, to make treaties, pro-
vided two thirds of tiie fcjenatoia present concur; and he
shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate shall appoint, embassadors, other public minis-
ters and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all
otliei officers of the United States whose appointments are
not herein otherwise piovitled for, and which shall be es-
tablished by law; hut the Congress may by law vest tile
appointment of such interior officers as they think proper
in the Fre.sident alone, m tiie courts of law, or in the heads
of Departments."
Mr. BROWN, of Wisconsin. Now the point
is this; that by that provision the President has
the unlimited power of making the selection, and
is not to be trammeled by the idea of either the
Secretary of the Treasury or of any other public
functionary, unless we vest that power directly
cither in the head of a Department or in the judge
of a court. In this instance the power is vested
in the President, and for that reason, under the
Constitution, we cannot trammel or limit the ex-
ercise of that discretion. *
Mr. STEVENS. I have no doubt of our
power upon this subject. We could vest the ap-
pointment entirely in the Secretary of the Treas-
ury if we chose. The Constitution is very express
upon that point. But I do not. think it ia worth
quarreling about; and since there is now such
a unanimous confidence in the President of the
United States I propose that the words be stricken
out. They were put in merely to guard against
the danger that some gentlemen might not have
the same unqualified confidence in the President
that wo have. I find we were mistaken, and that
everybody in the House has the most perfect con-
fidence in him. I hope, therefore, the amendment
will prevail.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. IIOOPER. I propose to take this oppor-
tunity to make some remarks upon the general
character of the bill before we proceed further
with the reading of it.
It is not my intention to detain the House with
any long examination of this bill, but only to call
attention to the principal changes which are pro-
posed by it from the act passed at the last session
of Congress to establish the national banking sys-
tem. It should be borne in mind that this is not
a bill to establish the system of national banks;
its only purpose is to amend the act which es-
tablished that system, to correct what the expe-
rience and observation of the past year have shown
to be imperfect, and to render the law so perfect
that the State banks -may be induced to organize
under it, in preference to continuing under their.-
State charters.
It is unjust to consider the national banking
law as inimical to the State banks; on the con-
trary, the object has been to offer every facility
to the State banks to organize under it, while it en-
courages banking upon sounder principles, which
will render u more secure for the stockholders,
more profitable to them in the long run, and more
beneficial to the people throughout the country.
โข 1 frankly confess that I look upon the system of
State banks as having outlived its usefulness, as
being unequal to the exigencies of the present
time, with the demands which this war is making
on the resources of the country and on its finan-
cial and monetary systems. I refer to them as
institutions connected with the growth and pros-
perity of the country. Let us consider for a mo-
ment what would have been our condition now if
we had attempted to carry on this war without
the changes that have been made, and had relied
on the State banks to furnish all the currency that
was needed.
Within the very first year of the war their in-
adequacy for this purpose was shown. TheGov-
ernment was of course obliged to call on the mon-
etary interest of the country represented by the
banks for means to carry on the war; the'prop-
erty and the money interest of the country was
bound to furnish the means, because the security
of all property depends upon the protection of
Qovernment, and its value upon the ability of the
Government to protect it.
The first important application by the Govern-
ment to the banks to' furnish money was made in
the summer of 1861, for ยง150,000,000, which the
banks of the principal cities agreed to furnish,
from time to time, by installments extending from
the middle of August to the end of that year.
But this created so great a strain upon them that
before the end of the year they deemed.it neces-
sary to suspend specie payments. It then became
necessary for the Government to rely upon its
own powers and its own resources, the result of
which was the' introduction of the legal-tender
currency of Government notes. Many who' op-
posed this measure at the time it was adopted,
and the few who oppose it now, object that it cre-
ates an irredeemable paper currency in place of
coin; and, in opposing it, all the arguments that
have been used from the time of Adam Smith
down to the latest writers on finance have been
arrayed to prove the advantages of a currency of
coin over one of paper money, as if it were a ques-
tion which of those two, paper money or coin,
the Government should have availed itself of in
that darkest period of trial. A currency of coin
was an absurdity at that time, as it has been ever
since, and those who talked about it knew it to be
so. The only question at that time was which of
two paper currencies should be selected; whether
it should be a paper currency furnished by the
banks, which would be extended almost indefi-
nitely by the Government use of it, and would be
contiolled entirely by the banks for their own
profit, or whether the Government should furnish
a currency of its own, to be under its own direc-
tion and contro|, made secure to the holders of it
by the pledged faith of the Government, all the
profits of which should accrue to the whole peo-
ple of the country, and which at this moment is
contiibuting directly more than four hundred mil-
lion dollars, without any cost for interest, to the
pecuniary means of the Government to carry on
this war, besides the means which it indirectly
furnishes, at a moderate rate of interest, and tha
facilities it affords in the negotiation of loans. I
confidently believe that if the bill authorizing the
issue of the legal-tender notes had failed to become
a law, and the Government had been obliged to
depend on the State banks,and to use their notes
for currency to carry on the war, we should have
had an inflation befoie this time beyond an vthing
that has occurred since the days of the French
assignats, and the Government and the country
would have been entirely prostrated in its finances
and in its currency.
We are told from the other side of this House
that there can be but one end to a currency of pa-
per money, based on the faith of the Government.
All the old speeches of the Opposition in Parlia-
ment, during the suspension of specie payments
in Great Britain, from 1797 to 1820, are hunted
up to be ventilated afresh here as original views
and opinions, to light us in our dismal pnth to
financial destruction; as if every one did not know
that the history of the "assignals" in France,
and'of the Continental money in this country,
were rather the exceptions than the rule in regard
to nations that have made use of paper money to
carry them through the temporary exigencies of
great wars. How many are there of the nations
of Europe that have not in times of war resorted
to the use of paper money, and when peace was
restored returned to the sounder basis of coin?
