saraii e. pickell.
Mr. TAYLOR, from the Committee on In-
valid Pensions, reported a bill granting a pen-
sion to the widow of Colonel John Pickell;
which was read a first and second time.
The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior
to place the name of Sarah E. Bickell, widow
of Colonel John Pickell, on the roll of invalid
pensioners, and pay the sum of fifty-seven dol-
lars per month to her, or in the event of the
marriage or death of the said widow, then to
the children, subject to the restrictions of the
pension laws.
_ M*. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I would
like to have the report read. It seems to ine'
that this is an entirely new principle.
The report was read.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. So far as
the first-portion of that bill is concerned I shall
interpose no objection; but that portion of it
which provides that the pension shall go to the
children after the marriage or death of the
widow is incorporating a new principle, and to
which I shall object. In all the bills we have
passed the pension has been limited to the
widowhood.
Mr. TAYLOR. This bill is in conformity
with the general pension law, and that pro-
vision is put in to prevent the necessity of the
children coming to Congress and asking a spe-
cial act. That is the reason of it, and it is in
conformity with the general pension law. The
Commissioner of Pensions refuses to continue
the pensions where they are granted by special
act, and the object is to avoid the necessity of
a separate application, if there are children
under sixteen years of age.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Let the
bill conform to what is the universal practice
of the House.
Mr. MORRIS. If I understand the rule, in
the event of the marriage of the widow, or her
death, the pension goes to the minor children,
and ceases when they arrive at majority. I
understand that to be the rule. Certainly it
is equitable. This Government can afford to
take care of the widows and orphans, until
they arrive at majority, of those who laid down
their lives for the country.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The gen-
tleman may be right as to the general pension
law. But what I say is, that this bill introduces
a new principle in our legislation. Heretofore,
in every case where we have passed a special
bill for the relief of a widow, we have confined
it to her widowhood or natural life. Now,
in this case, the paijjy is not entitled to any
pension under the general law ; but it is pro-
posed to go further in this than in any other
case. Now, I am as patriotic a man as any,
I think, and as willing to go as far as any one.
But I think this is a dangerous principle, and
should not be adopted in this House.
Mr. TAYLOR. This bill comes within the
spirit of the general pension law. It merely
continues the pension, in case this widow dies
or marries, to her children until the age of six-
teen.
Mr. FARQUHAR. I understand the objec-
tion of the distinguished gentleman from Illi-
nois [Mr. Washburne] to the principle involved
