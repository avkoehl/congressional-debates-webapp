For the purpose of showing to you the position of the Confederate Government in relation to the imprisonment of non-combatants, I now renew to you the proposal which I have frequently tendered to your predecessor. I propose that all the non-combatants now held in prison on either side by immediately and unconditionally released, and further, that both Government agree that no captures of non-combatants shall hereafter be made. If the latter branch of this proposition is too broad I will thank you to suggest any proper modifications.

SIR: In the Army and Navy Official Gazette of the date of July 14, 1863, I find a letter of Lieutenant Colonel William H. Ludlow, of the date of July 7, 1863, addressed to Colonel J. C. Kelton. In it is the following paragraph, to wit:

I have the honor also to state that since the 22nd of May last it has been distinctly understood between Mr. Ould and myself that all captures must be reduced to possession and that all paroles are to be disregarded unless under the special arrangement of commanding officers of armies in the field as prescribed in section 7 of the cartel.

If Lieutenant-Colonel Ludlow means that he had declared to me that such was the rule which had been adopted by the United States in
