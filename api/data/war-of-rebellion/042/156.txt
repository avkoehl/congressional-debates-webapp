In trying the guns upon my boats, I found the Nichols gun totally unfit for service, and turned it over to the ordnance officer at this post.

The cartridges of the Parrott gun from the Harriet Lane were also unserviceable, as they would not chamber by 3 inches, being altogether too large, which I was compelled to remedy by reducing the dimensions of the cartridges to fit the bore. I am confident this same difficulty occurred with the gun on board the Bayou City, January 1, which caused its bursting, and I would most respectfully recommend that the ordnance officers having charge of this work be notified of the error and severely reprimanded for neglecting so important a branch of their duty.

The trail of the 18-pounder El Dragon brass gun broke off close to the cheeks at the first fire; it was apparently perfectly sound, but on examination of the pieces after the casualty, I found it was totally unfit for service by dry rot.

Because of this accident, I would most respectfully suggest that an examination be made by boring into the old carriages of all the guns in this district, as the may all be affected in like manner. I have ordered a new trail to be made for that gun, which will completed to-day.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LEON SMITH,

Commanding Marine Department.

[NOTE ON ORIGINAL.]-Deducting the garrison at Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines and Grant's Pass-the cavalry force of the department (which in case of an investment of the city will be sent without the line of intrenchments) and the guard at Selma and Montgomery-leaves me an effective total for the defense of the city of 2,554 men [effective total for defense should be 2,564], including the Fifty-fourth [Fifty-seventh] Alabama Infantry, stationed at Pollard. Note also that the Seventeenth and Twenty-ninth Alabama Regiments are drilling as artillery.
