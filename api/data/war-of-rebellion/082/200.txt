HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field,July 12, 1864-10.50 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Armies:

On Kautz's expedition Elder's battery lost all its guns and equipments. The inclosed requisitions are to remount it. My own belief is that a battery should never be remounted where it loses its guns, without an investigation, and I therefore forward the requisitions to the lieutenant-general commanding for his judgment. This is probably all right, but we lose guns too easily where is no penalty attached to the loss except to get new ones.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

I examined a deserter on Saturday, who gave me a very intelligent and graphic account of Hunter's proceedings near Lynchburg, which he received in a letter from his family, which came to him via Gordonsville Junction. He had no doubt that the road was open, upon inquiring of him particularly upon that subject. Further information will be obtained and forwarded.

HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, July 12, 1864-12 m.

General WEITZEL,General Butler's Headquarters:

Nothing has been heard from Baltimore since the report of Wallace's defeat at Monocacy and retreat toward Baltimore. There seems to be little apprehension in Washington, and it is thought there that the enemy will recross the Potomac one hearing of Wright's arrival. Some of them are reported in a dispatch just received as passing between Rockville and Washington.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

CITY POINT, VA., July 12, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&amp;c.:

Have you heard whether the enemy have yet run cars from Richmond north to Gordonsville? If you have any scouts who can go out and ascertain certainly I would be glad to have them go.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
