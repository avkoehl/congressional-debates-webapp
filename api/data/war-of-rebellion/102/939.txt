Lieutenant J. S. GRAHAM,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Denver, Colo. Ter.:

SIR: I have the honor to report that 100 Jicarrilla Apaches, of New Mexico, have arrived in this country with the intention to join the Utes, at present in the Wet Mountain Valley. Considering the doubtful good behavior of the Ute Indians, I did not think it for good to allow these Apaches to advance any farther north; therefore met them eighteen miles south from here on last Saturday, and have forbidden them to move any farther into our Territory. The Apaches had leave from their Indian agent to come up here and hunt, what I consider not right, here being enough Indians of our own Territory.

I am, sir, Your obedient servant,

CH. KERBER,

Captain, Veteran Battalion First Colorado Cavalry, Commanding Post.
