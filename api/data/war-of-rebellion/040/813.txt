found that, taking into consideration the guns actually on hand, and not those expected, that each battery will be found to be well supplied and have a few extra horses. In proof of this, I need only recall your attention to the fact that the chief of artillery, Second Corps (Colonel Brown's), requisition, based on the number of guns actually in his possession, showed only 15 horses needed to fill out his artillery. Since then I have issued to the artillery of the Second Corps, at your request, two-thirds of the horses I received a few days ago, in all 273, which Colonel Brown divided as follows:

Horses.

To Colonel Brown's battalion....................... 112

To Colonel Jones' battalion........................ 17

To Colonel Walker's battalion...................... 56

To Colonel Carter's battalion...................... 14

To Major McIntosh's battalion, by request of

General Pendleton................................... 34

To Colonel Andrews' battalion, by request of

General Pendleton................................... 40

-----

Total............................................... 273

To the First Corps you requested me to issue one-third, and you gave me the number to issue to each battalion, as follows:

Horses.

Washington Artillery battalion..................... 32

Colonel Garnett's battalion........................ 26

Colonel Cabell's battalion......................... 10

Colonel Alexander's battalion...................... 38

Issued to Colonel Alexander's battalion (that is,

taken by him from teams that were ordered to be

turned in to me)................................... 17

-----

Total.............................................. 123

The excess over two-thirds issued to the Second Corps is owing to the fact that the horses for the First Corps were first selected by me-one-third of all the serviceable horses; afterward the officers of the Second Corps selected many horses I considered unfit for service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Quartermaster.
