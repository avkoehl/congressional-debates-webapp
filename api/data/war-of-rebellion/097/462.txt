charges of the enemy have been repulsed handsomely. About forty messages have been received to-day from the different stations. I fear I shall run entirely out of turpentine to-night, and I think Lieutenant Capron should have sent me some to-day, as requested last night.

Captain DAVIS,

Chief Signal Officer, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Since last report have had no good view of left. The firing on line of Weldon railroad appears unchanged. All artillery visible in large fort by lead-works has been removed, and a few horses remaining in the fort all saddled, with blankets, &amp;c., on saddles, apparently prepared for a night move. On inside facings of Fort Mahone the enemy show a strong line of battle. At other points they are so well screened as to prevent a view of their numbers.
