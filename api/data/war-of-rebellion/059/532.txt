NASHVILLE, April 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The following just received:

WASHINGTON, April 29, 1864-1.45 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The Secretary of War is of opinion that it would be injurious to remove General Allen from the immediate supervision of the vast business transacted by the quartermaster's department of Louisville, and therefore disapproves the order which I had requested as suggested by you.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

Respectfully,

M. ROCHESTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, April 29, 1864.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I am here all right. Tell Rousseau the road appears thinly guarded about Wartrace; he had better send 100 men there for a short while till people get used to the diminution of the road guard. I have received several dispatches by the way, which I will answer as soon as I get a locality.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Chattanooga, April 29, 1864.

General ROUSSEAU,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Order General Paine and the regiment now at Gallatin to Tullahoma, and give him charge of the defense of the road, embracing Duck and Elk River bridges. Replace Paine's troops by some guard at the bridges. The road north of Nashville is not important to us, but that south is vital. Remember to place gun-racks and muskets in all the forts and strong buildings, so that citizens may, if necessary, assist in the defense of Nashville. But there is no danger there now and cannot be for a month to come.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

LOOKOUT VALLEY, April 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

The gun-boat will be ready to leave Bridgeport to go down the river early to-morrow morning.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
