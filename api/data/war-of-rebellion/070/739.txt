HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Dublin, May 17, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

I received a telegram from you several days since to order Brigadier-General Vaughn's brigade to Staunton as soon as he could be spared from this department. As the condition of our supplies and the absence of a part of his command in North Carolina necessitates still delay in his departure, I respectfully ask to retain these troops for the purpose of reclaiming East Tennessee from the enemy. I fell assured, from the reports made by my scouts, Knoxville and all east of that point can be taken by the troops under my command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. E. JONES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Received 8 a. m.)

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Enemy camped at Strasburg last night. My pickets are two miles below Woodstock. I have commenced rebuilding bridge. River still swims horses. Will press forward as soon as possible. Enemy reported much disorganized and demoralized. I think he will not halt this side of Martinsburg.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

RUDE'S HILL, May 17, 1864.

(Via New Market.)

General BRECKINRIDGE:

I have 100 men detailed rebuilding the bridge. Have secured necessary lumber and have a professional bridge-builder at work, who says it will require three or four days to finish it. River is falling, and may be forded to-morrow or next day. No other bridges burnt as far as heard from. My pickets are below Woodstock, and scouts sent forward, who will report to-night from Strasburg. If enemy's whole force is at Strasburg, it would be hazardous for me to risk an advance during these heavy rains, till I finish the bridge.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.
