States from the date of said circular to the end of the war. Drafted men and substitutes for drafted men were paid the $100 bounty until the passage of the act of Congress approved July 1, 1864, when it was decided that all authority for the payment of bounty to drafted men and substitutes had been rescinded by the act.

Letters from the War Department, dated November 29, 1863, to Major General B. F. Butler, and of December 22, 1863, to Major General Q. A. Gillmore, authorized the payment of a bounty not to exceed $10 per man for colored recruits. This bounty was also paid from this fund.

General Orders, No. 115, of June 15, 1865, from the Adjutant- General's Office, fixed July 1, 1865, as the date upon which the United States should cease to pay bounty to recruits for the military service.

SECOND AUDITOR'S AND PAYMASTER-GENERAL'S CASES.

Numerous letters of inquiry as to the payment of advance bounty to certain soldiers are sent to this office by the Second Auditor of the Treasury and the Paymaster-General of the Army.

Each inquiry is examined and reported upon separately and consumes much time and labor.

These reports are based upon information obtained from the muster-in rolls on file in the Adjutant-General's Office, and from the bounty accounts of mustering and disbursing officers on file in this office. In many cases all the rolls of a regiment have to be examined to find the name of the man about whom inquiry is made; and where there was more than one officer disbursing in the State at the time the man was mustered in, each one of these officer's bounty accounts has to be examined to ascertain whether the man was paid or not.

To give some idea of the amount of labor expended on there reports I will state that the number reported on and returned to the Second Auditor and Paymaster-General from January, 1864,to January 1, 1866, is 6,268. These inquiries are increasing daily in number.
