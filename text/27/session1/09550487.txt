SPEECH OF MR  WINTHROi?,
OF   MAS^ACHtJSFTTS
In the Bousp of Representatives, July 28, 1841—On the bill
m re^tton to dutie* and drawbacks,
Mr W1NTHROP said he rose foi no purpose of declamation
or display, if he were atany time, capable or either He would
takeup no time m commenting on the extraordinary discovery
■which had ptst been pioclaimed by the gentleman from New
Yoik[Mr McKeonJ—theüemociacy oí direct taxation Nor
had he any hope of being able tu Oo fai into the consideration
the compromise act, though li the inexoiahle hour, which
must come a'ike t > all in this Ilou&e, should not come to him
too suddenly, and cut him off premat irely m his iemaik>, he
should be glad to notice some of the smgulai constructions
which had been put upon that act by gentlemen from South
Caiohrsa and Viigima Hio main puipo0e in addiessing the
H juse was to offer a lew practical suggestions in relation to the
bill undei con ideration He ft.lt ¡ oimd to tffer them asthe
Representative of a gieatcommercial conmemty—a commu
mty deeply interested mmanuaciuies also, and whose bu¡>i
nes=> of all kinds might be senoualy affected by such a meas ne
of legislation He desired, mare especially to explain his
views without further delay, as it was his misfortune to differ,
in some respects, on the present occasiou, from many of those
with whom he usually acted, and with whom he always de
Sfpal to agree
Unquestionably, said Mr W this House ought not to ad'ourn
without making some new piovision for supplying the wants
of the Government Nothing could be more evident, to any one
■who bestowed even tne most cursory examination upon the
condition of the Tibasury, than that a much laiger amount of
revenue was needed for the public service than c mtd he m&ed
by existing laws T ec'eai and able statement of the han man
Of the Comnittee of Ways and Means it the opening ofíms bill,
and the no less luminous exposition of his honoi able fuend who
hadjust taken his seat, [Mr Barnard ] must have been sum
cient to convince even the mo"t strenu tus or ponemsol thispo
sitian Here and there, indeed, there mightb found somebody
to dspute it—somebody to serve a* an ilíusüation of the old
Hudibrastic couplet—
" He that's convinced against his w m
Is of the same opinion •mil'
But the great majority of the House   he pre&umed  however
they mightdiffei as to the time when, or the manner m which,
they should be ra ¡sed, must be rcauy to admit that the Govern
«lent could not go rninuch longei without fre^hsupplies
We were aheady largely in debt The improvidence of a
past Administidtion had already driven us to the necessity of
borrowing twelve millions of dolíais, and we ha 1 promised,
somewhat rashly, is he thought, to repay the debt in thiee
yeirs Meantime, out resmices, under existing laws, were
lapidly diminishing We had no seventeen milho is of sm plus
moneys to fall back upon asoui predecessors hid at the com
mencement of 1837 They had «pent it il We had no nine

United Sta esha^em deposite with the States   And the then Se
cretaiy of the Tieasury (Mr Woodbury) went a gioddeal fur
therinthes meiotimation  In his last report on thestate of the
finance? he not only include^ this sum m his exhibit of tne gene
ral balance on the Treasurer'  books   but expressly suggested
the expediency of recalling those deposite^ m inticipation of a
deficiency m tha Treasury, and as a measure more eligib'e than
a loan.   "The idea," he said, "that such a deficiency iu time
of peace ought to be supplied by Treasury nouts, or by a loan,
has never been enteiUmed by the un^eisigntd, noi can it be
countenanced by any sound puncipleg either (1 finirce or poli
tical economy The uiquiiy then recurs, what otter moc'e
would be moie eligible When we posseted-m ejviiaoiünvuy
surplus it was considered prudent by Congiess lo make depo
sites with the States with a view to be r^Un ned n an exigencv,
rathei than to invest a portion of it bafely and pioducuvely, so
as tobe realized in cuchan event It wojid, theiefore, be con
sidered consistent with such an anansement to íecdll in 1812
such part of the surplus as may he needed Thit course, how
ever," he adds, "appeals not very likely to be adopted, since
the formerpower given to this Department to recall those depo
sites has been taken away by Congress "
There seemed to be something moie than an implication
here that if the power had not been taken away from theSe
cietary, or the Secretary been turned out of power, those de
posites would have been recalled in 1S42, and perhaps one
of the designs of the friends of the late Admmistiation,
should they ever succeed m regaining their lost suprem tcv,
was to unite a recall of these deposits with the repeal of the
Bank, the abrogation of the land bill, the ie establishment of
the Sub Tieasury, and the other measuies which they moie
openly avowed It would certainly be an appropmte element
msuch a system Mr W hoped that the paity now in audio
rity would do what they might to defeat a y ¡such movement,
by parsing a bill at the nextsession to remit ieteasp,and foi
ever quitclaim to the States all the right title and mteiest of
the General Government m and to the afoiesaid deposites it
would remove a deceptive entry from the Treaeuiy books it
would relieve (he States fiom a vexatious liability, and H would
take from the nation a power which it ought rot possess
The Government ought not to have such a rod m pickle,
to be brandished in Ipi roí em over the sovereign States of this
Union But, whether this were done or not, no Whig Admi
nistration would ever dieam of making a demand for those de
posites They could not, then, be reasonably legarded m any
estimate of t&e national resources m any emergency whatever
And we were left, therefoie, as he had belore said entirely to
the ordinary custom-house revenues fot the meansof suppoit
huí the Government.
But how was it with those revenues? Every one knew they
had been undergoing a process of slow but ecrtam dmnnutun
for eight yeais past, and that, within the next y cat, that \ ro
cess was to be brought to a close by two successive led icti ns,
amounting, together, to at least five millions of d>] ars And
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means had  tven
us an estimate, from which it would ipptar tint the gross
amount of customs which would accrue undti thehws m, they
would be left, when these final reductions should have taken
place, would not exeeed fourteen millions of dollars and that,
aftei deducting the expenses of codec ion and allowing foi
drawbacks, there would remain a neit sum oí less thin ten
millions to be applied to the support of ti e Government
Mr W was inclined to think that this esiimate u as too low
and for reasons to which he would presently allude lie was
inclined to think that we might rely on receiving at lcasi twelve
oí thuteen millions of nett revenue fiom this source flu
Kigeat of these sums however, would obviously be wht. lly ma
doquate for the piesent exigencies of the country It would fali
far short of being sufficient for out annual expenses, to ^¿y
nothing of the debts bequeathed to us by cm predeccssi is
Why even the late Administration itsell, when it was fitting
from pow-er, and attempting to atone by ptetepis ol econotry
for piactices of extravagance—even the late Secietiry of the
Tieasurv when pointing to us the thorny wa> >f rctrencl ment
an 1 reform after having bo long pursued the prmuo e \ th of
dalliance himself—did not sugstestthat alowei sum th<ni seven
t en or eighteen millions of dollars could b< made to answer foi
the annud expenditures ofthecourmy Hut ifweturnod from
the (lying precepts of the late Admmistiation to their example
dunnglle, we found that the avtri^e expenditures duru g the
nuryeaisot their existence were a jout twenty eight millics
per annum
And here, Mr W said, he was willing to confers that he
thought we should not be ab'e tn nduce t v e\pen biuret of
the next four years very much below th it urn Jiue we had
constantly complained ofoiu predeces nt. as < xti avast mt, as

And no State smce the foundation of soeiety has ever been im
povenshedby that species ot profusion
"^Ttwas to this economy that we had pledged ourbclve^, an
economy of-eelection and proportion, an ee onomy wh ch should
not eke out the means of boundless extravagance 10 one In e o
expenditure, by bace injustice in another, which should not
save on tne real service of the country to bestow upon job ,
I
which should not thrust aside the honest claimant or the agedf
pensioner to make room for more dependants and more
I lacemen, but which, spending as little as the public interest
would admit, should spend all that the public honor and the
public justice and the public saiety shonld require,trrjstnig fear
lessly to a just, geneioua, intelligent, and discriminating people
to sustain and sanction its outlays The party in power had in-
deed pledged themselves to economy But they had not pledged
themselves to abandon our fortifications, to let the country re-
main, as our predecessors had left it, exposed at every point,
from Passamaquoddy to the Sabine, to the invasion of a foreign
foe, to leave the Navy m its present weak and miserable eo -
dition, to extinguish the lights along our shoree, and let our
commerce wreck itself on an iron or an ice bound coast The
people of this country would despise and condemn aach eco-
nomy as this They had condemned it already He honestly
believed it was not the amount to which the late Administra-
tion carried uptheexpenduuresoftheGovemmentwhiehhad
biought upon them the rebuke ofthe nation, so much as the
ends for which those expenditures were made The people
become indignant when they saw that their money wa 
srent for noughtj and their substance for that which was no*
bread
Having thus admitted that alarge addition to the revenues of
the coun ry was indispensably necessary, Mr W proceeded to 
the consideration of the pending bill as the mode of making encb
addition He was not prepared to say that it would malee too*
large an mciea&e, nor would he hesitate, had we the time to
spend upon it, and the information necessary for acting upon it
undeistandmgly and safely, to go with the chairman of lhe
Committee of Ways and Means in maturing a bill which would
yield at least an equal amount But, he has compelled to say,
we had not the time, we had not the information Already
theie was an impatience to bring this debate to a close,
aheady the House had voted to take the question on
this bill withm one week from the day it was entered upon
Other great measures were behind, to which this must give
away Nov., sir, (said Mr W ) in behalf of the commercial
and manufacturing interests of the country, I protest against
the adoption of a measure of this magnitude without more opv
poi tumty being afforded for us examination This bill was or 
oí novel impression, and required far more than ordinary carft
In the revenue bills heretofore passed—of late years certainly
—the articles on which a duty was to be laid had been specified
and named, and thobe which were to remain free had been left
to implication In bills so framed we could see at once what
we were voting for, and the countiy could see at one what was
to be the operation of our votes This bill, it would be per
reived, puisued theopposite course It enumerated the free
ax tides only, and left those which were to pay a duty to be dis*
coveied by a refeience to the tables Such a mode of legisla-
tion might be expedient, if there were proper preparation for
it It would unquestionably prevent many evasions and many
liamK, and save much to the revenue. But there was great
dan^ei in adopting it hastily We could not see where we were
cutting We did not know where we mightstrike We wera
likely to do great injury and great injustice withoutbeing aware
of it
As an illustration of this, and as proof, also, of the injus*
tice of some of the particulai piovisions of this bill, he would
¿ive the committee a little of his own experience He repre-
sented, as he had said, a great meaeantile community—a com-
munity the tecond in commercial importances, the Union, and
which owned more than one tenth of the entire tonnage of the
country He deeply regretted that they were not more ade-
quately represented on this floor, and that the serious ill health:
duung the last year of the experienced merchant and excellent
man who had pieceded him in the Boston seat, [Mr Abbott*
I AwrrNce,) had deprived them of his services at so important
t os&k \ \s the present They were also a great manufactur-
ing c( mm u nuy Tosay nothing of the mechanic arts of every
variety which were so extensively earned on m their midst, a
laige pioportion of the manufacturing capital of New England
was owned by his constituents Welt, in due course of mail,
ind tluou^h the medium of the newspaper, this bill, or some
absti ict of it, (for there had been no printed copies to circulate,)
had c me to then knowledge And what had been the result
m the single week which had since elapsed?
He hal in the first place, received numerous letters on the
sidject of wool cobting below 8 cents a pound, on which this
bill pi i posed to lay a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem They
ill a^ieel m asserting (hat tins duty would involve the entire?
ovt\ brow of the estabir*hmentb engaged m the manufacture of
tint inicie There we e many of those establishments in Mas-
sachusetts in Connecticut, and in other parts of New England
This low puced wot 1 wi-i li ought from Buenos Ayres, and
Smyrni, and liarbaiy, an 1 elsewhere I\ot apound of it was

wor ttd eai pet fillings, some coarse keiseys and satinets, and*

ronvntel was negro cloth The agent of a single

in this article, that one h msem the city of Charleston, South

effect on the 1st of September, head in a few cargoes at the
wharf which were ordered befoie any warning was given, and
exact an unexpected duty from them before they could b&

nue he would bay, for a great commercial nation Butthe duty
v/ould as he was assured, amount ultimately to prohibition

ceive i into the ? reasury This v- as the first piece of informa
tion which he had received, and gentlemen would acknowledge
that it was not altogether unimportant
The next fact which had been brought to his notice was, that,
among the non enumerated articles on which a duty of 20 per
cent would be laid by the bill was type metal, used for making
types and casting stereotype plates    This dutys also¡ he ww
