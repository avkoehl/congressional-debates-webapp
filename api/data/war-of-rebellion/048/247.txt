honorable positions they hold, and entitles them to consideration whenever more advanced stations are open to worth.

Lieutenant-Colonel Morgan, assistant inspector-general, was to me invaluable. His untiring energy, knowledge, and intelligence, under all circumstances, show him fitting for a high command, and I would especially recommend him to the Government to be made a brigadier-general. He is one to whom any command that rank might give him would be well entrusted.

Lieutenant Colonel F. A. Walker, assistant adjutant-general, thoroughly acquainted with his office duties, so important to the operations of an army corps, is equally willing and gallant on the field. Captain H. H. Bingham, aide-de-camp, deserve mention for his arduous, circuitous, and successful night expedition to headquarters, the only night we had a chance to sleep. Captain Miller and Major Mitchell, the personal aide of Major-General Hancock, and Lieutenant haskell, of General Gibbon's staff, performed on all occasions that service to me they owed to those officers, in a manner that was ever cheering and certain. Captain E. P. Brownson, additional aide-de-camp, attached to these headquarters, has my acknowledgments for cheerful and intelligent service during these operations. Lieutenant-Colonel Batchelder, chief quartermaster, and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, chief commissary of subsistence, were with the general trains of the army during the entire movement, and therefore not under my observation.

Surg. A. N. Dougherty, medical director, was exceedingly thorough in his duty to the wounded, and everywhere exposed himself to be counted with those he was anxious to serve. His successful provision for the wounded could not have been excelled, even in an advancing movement.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers Commanding Second Corps.
