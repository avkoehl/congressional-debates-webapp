JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS:

The passage of batteries at Vicksburg by a large number of enemy's vessels on night of 6th [16th] shows conclusively that we have an in sufficient number of guns. There are so many points to be defended at this time-Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Port Hudson, Snyder's Mill, and Fort Pemberton-that I have only twenty-eight guns at Vicksburg. Of these, two are smooth-bore 32s, two 24s, one 30-pounder Parrott, one Whitworth, and one 10-inch mortar. Vicksburg and Port Hudson, and if possible Grand Gulf, ought to be greatly strengthened in guns. I have also sent 4,000 men from Port Hudson to General Johnston. The enemy has eleven armed vessels between and projectiles should be constantly forwarded.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

I have ordered General Buford to return. Troops still continue to come down the river, and the number going up, none or inconsiderable. I have telegraphed General [E. K.] Smith, asking him to co-operate with me on the river.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

A superior force from Corinth is in front of Colonel Roddey at Tuscumbia. If you can send troops from Columbus or elsewhere, to aid Colonel Roddey, they may to great service to the two departments.

Colonel Roddey and your nearest officer must co-operate against the enemy's raids from Corinth.
