25th CoNG....lst Sess.
Upon Nouns, Pionouns, Verb?, and Adverbs—Mr, Mams.
H. ot Reps.
plained of the bill befóte the committee <i an ex pout Jacio law,
and oppressive and ei uel in its opeiaiioiB upon the State he
cam* irom Certainly theie wa  nothing ciuel in the term? of
thi* act, but, ou the cuatiaiy, it was excessively mlulgent to all
the delinquent banks
Mr \. remarked, thai the committee now perceived the ie7a
tiorun which the Sink ot Alabama stood to the State itself the
bank itseif being the ¡5ta,te But it ha I been said by a gentle
man from Kentucky, (Mr Chambeis ) that it was impossible,
in this particular case, to raise the money required What,
sir, (a&kcd Mi A ) is the credit of the toiate of Alabama worth
nothing 8 r, <oul 1 not the State of Alabama raise by her
ferédUj in twenty four hour^, a loan, of one million of dollars,
and pay off thi  debt of her bank?
[Mr Chapean!, of Alabama, said, " Yes, at five peí cont m
eerest"]
It was, then, perfectly possible, and it wa  natuial that the
Contlemaji fiom that Slate should feel indignant at (lit, imputa
tioi that it was not, especially when, as had been sud by one
of them, (\tr Chipman ) that that State could, at any moment,
raise a loan of a m Ilion ot dollars' And where, then, (a^ked
Mr A ) would be the chai go of ctueltj, on the pin of this dead
letter law?
A.3 10 the second section of the bill, Mi A did noi know any
very stiong objection  which could he btought against it lis
referred to the provisions of tin law of hint. lS3b, depositing
the surpUs money in the Treasmy with the States, and advened
to the facts that thi ec of the instalments authorized by that ac^af
Congress, had been paid over, and that the fourth instalment,
payable on the first day of the culrent mouth, had been pofct
poned by a recent act until Januaiy, 18 9 In connection with
the^e hUb Mi \ took a comparative view of the amounts to
which the States were  eveially entitled on the fii^t oí Oetober,
133?, under the deposite act of June, 1836, and of the amounts
of public moneys actually on depute with the several totales
in July and August, 183?, obeemng that he deuved these state
men's fiom the leportof the Secietary of the Tieasuiy
Mr Speaker, (continued Mr A ) theieis one pontof view m
which this bill, togethei with that to v\ hich it it> a mere supple
meiit, or uder—I mean the bill foi the postponement of the
fourth instalment of the dt poshes with the States—is so deeply
mteiesung to my immediate constituents, to tho&e ol my rol
leag ie% and to ihoai of m my other membeis of this Hou^o,
that I deem it my indispensable duty to expose t to the íiouse
and to the country, in minute, though in diy and tedious detail,
asapreHmmaiy to which, I mu-st lead so much ol the deporto
act oftheíSdof Tune, 1836, as pie&mbes the payment of the
deposites to the totales    It is in these wouU

the condition of the Tieasuiy, if I po-scs«cd a« much as he
doesof thefivorof theJIiuit I would solicit tli «amepnvi
lege for this statomrm of mine all drawn *iím iho íepoitsof
tae Secretary of the Iieasury himsell But I sh ill iutmake
that request I shall merely publr h it for the inform i ion
of the people, and I com nend it to the special attention of the
member? upon this floor, of what used to be wiled the good
old thirteen State*, above all, to the representatives of the sa\
New England States that they may see how naturally the mo
ney of this Union flows to the North or to the East And, ab
some of them have been taught, by sundiy teamed statistn s of
the Globe, to think that the payment of the fourth instalment of
the deposites ought to be íepealed btcause It would require a
new tax upon the people^ I lespectfullyask them to peiloim the
simple procese, of arithmetical subtraction oí nine million thiee
hundred and sixty seven thousand two hundred and foui teen
dolíate and ninety nine cents, the whole sum which should
have been paid to the States on the first of Octobei, from the
sum of nine million eight hundred and one thousand nine hut
dred and twenty one dollars and fdrty nine cents, which on that
very fiist of October was actually deposited in the favorite
depository banks so cordially cherished, and so often eulogized
by the piofoundcalculatoi of the Treasury Department Ihe
money was all thcie At least it had been all there, and if it
had been, at the special recommendation of the Secretary of the
fiea uiy, scattered abroad m discounts among the people, to
purchase intnds to the administration, he was at least respon
sible that the money -should be foithcomm  when it should be
wanted for the payment of the foutth instalment He had, I
say moie than fifteen months' notice of that coming day-
more than ten months' notice of it befoie the suspension oi
speci payments by any ol the banks The Specie cirt ulai was
issued within twenty days aftei the enactment of the deposite
law Nothing but the constitutional i urreuey, gold and silver,
was witli a tilling exception, to be íeceived it all the land
offices for the pt ot eedt> of sales of the public lauds Why n> it
that the toecietary had not, befoie the fiist of October, 1S37,
placed in depo itc in the banks of each totatc in the Union a
sum sufficient to piy the instalment due to that Stale on that
day7 Why i& it that after draining the Atlantic States of their
gold and olivet, to pay at western land offices, and into western
banks foi all the wild speculations m western lando, when the
day of payment Comes ioi the fourth instalment, the funds are
found all or neaily all diawn off fiom all the deposite banks m
the Atlantic Spates, and millions upon milliois, not of conetitu
tional cuirency, but of una\ailablc funds of rags and bhin
plas ers, are heaped up m those very western and southwest
ern States, wheie the jand was sold, and wheie ihe Sy< cie en
cular was to prove a mine, outshining fai the wealth of
Oimus or of Ind'l,,

his hand ]

peHcd Í heard a distinguished member irom the State of Con

fifty five thousand dolíais, lie dreaded the idea that it would be

The sum wHih tht hv i^eW Lngland States were entitled

one million five hunched and ^" thiee thou and and sixty
three dollars and Seveniyvseven cents
