BALTIMORE, MD., September 27, 1863-11 p.m.

(Received 12.09 p.[a] m., 28th.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your suggestion about instructions to our telegraph operators to prevent delay to troops by interference by these officers on line is received, and will be acted upon at once. It was only by a willful delay, by our operator at Grafton, of Schurz's message to Fairmont that the detention of troops was avoided.

You address me as captain. I have not accepted that commission, but hope by my present efforts to satisfy you that I deserve a higher grade.

W. P. SMITH.

BEALETON STATION, September 27, 1863-3 p.m.

WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Baltimore:

We have now (3 p.m.) 4,500 men to embark. This will complete both corps.

By conferring with Mr. Devereux at Alexandria as to the number of cars there, you can make calculations as to our wants. I think this whole movement so far has been a complete success. Hope it may terminate so.

D. S. McCALLUM.

CAMDEN STATION, September 27, 18863.

Captain DEVEREUX:

We sent you this afternoon some 60 more cars with seats, making in all considerably beyond our complement of 420. Colonel McCallum at 3 p.m. telegraphed, 4,500 yet to embark to complete movement,and that you could tell me as to the want of cars. Will not our last 60, with some of your own, make up the number required?

W. P. SMITH.

CAMDEN STATION, September 27, 1863-9.10 p.m.

Colonel D. C. McCALLUM,

Bealeton:

Your dispatch about men yet to be embarked received.

We have certainly furnished beyond our agreed number of cars under requisitions, namely, 420 with seats. I fear they have not been packed closely enough. They ought to average 38 at least. I will confer with Captain Devereux. I am glad to report the continued success of the movement,and that more than 3,000 me are now in Ohio on their way westward.

W. P. SMITH.
