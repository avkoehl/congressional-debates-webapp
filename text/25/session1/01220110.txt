CONGRESSIONAL QLOBK
stopping with a resolution either censuring or not
censuring some officer of the Government
Mr GLASCOCK regretted that it became his
duty again to address, the House on this subject,
but, as he had thought propel to move an amend-
ment to the original resolution, and m consequence
of remarks made to-day, he felt rt to be his duty to
do so It seemed now, from the remarks of the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wise) that he evin-
ces a great indifference from that heretofore evinced
by bun m relation to the disposition to be made of
the resolution offered by him, and he seems to
think that there is no disposition on the part of the
majority of the House to go into the investigation
pre; o*td Sir, (said Ml G ) that gentleman mu^t
see entirely different from himself,if he has íeccntly
discoveied any thing like a disposition to evade
this question. He had expiessed himself on a for-
mer occasion m favor of this inquiry, and he was
still desirous that it should be had He felt it to
be due to all the officers in the army who have been
engaged in that unfortunate war—he felt it due to
the Government, and he felt it due to the people of
tsecountry—and whatever dispos (ion the gentleman
now feel disposed to make of this question, he
hoped the majontyof ihe Hou e would maintain
its original intention to carry out the investigation
His object m not wishing the committee to sit dur-
ing the reí e*s, was to save as much as possible
the country from the expenses already uicui-
red in the piosecution of that war, particulaily
when all the ends of all parties asking this investi-
gation could be attained without it It has been
truly and justly remarked by the gentleman Irom
Maryland, (Mr Howard,) that there aie weighty
and important documents, which will occupj the
attention of the members of the committee,
which may be appointed at this time, during
the recess, which will gne them the opportu-
nity of tormmg correct opinions in relation
to the matter, and enable them to proceed
promptly to the execution of their duty at the
next session of Congress But what astonished
him most was, to find the gentleman from Virginia
(Mr Wist) reading letters and documents to the
House for the puipose of forestalling public opi-
nion m relation to this mquiiy Mr G confessed
that this was pursuing a course which he had been
taught fiom the commencement of his political life,
mall transactions, studiously to avoid He had
been taught that, whenever an investigation was
to be had where it w as exp"cted that all the testi-
mony would be brought to bear upon every point,
it was improper to forestall pubic opinion, and
produce a prejudice in the public muuU, by intro-
ducing evidence in advance, and sending it foith to
the country
Mr WISE said this was verv different ground
fiom Ihit tiken by the gentleman's party last ses-
sion, when it vi as ínsiottd on that specific chargoa
should be made against the Executive Departments
before a committee should be asked for to investi-
gate them
Mr G-LASOOCK said this was not the first time
that ¡fte parly to which he belonged had been re-
ferred to As for himself, he was onlv responsible
for his own acts, and the gentleman would do him
the justice to sav, that he was among the first to
advocate the investigation then asked for He
stood almost alone in the first instance m favor of
the mquirv
* Mr WISE would do the gentleman the justice
to say that he did, b it at that time he was not ex-
actly recognised a-, one of the party
Mr GLASCOCK replied, that, whether he was
considered as one of ¡fte pmty or not, no man in
his section of countrv ever doubted vvheie he stood
m relation to the prominent measures of General
Jackson's administration No man e/er doubted
that even 1 is political enemies never doubted it,
or, if they d d, no act of his life authorized n, and
it was gra'uitous on their pari But to pioceed to
the qupstion before the House he confessed, so far
as the resolution was concerned, ihe true and pro-
per course, inks judgment, would be to adopt the
amendment he had submitted He differed fiom
the gentleman from Marj land as to the manner m
which this committee should be appointed, and as
to what e9mmut«e the matter should be referred
to In his opinion, the t-ue course of policy was,
that a select committee should bt apf omied by the
Chair, and he again repeated, that if the commit-
tee w as lo eifeet any practicable good, it should be
so constituted as to hare the confidence of the peo-
ple of the country. The gentleman lrom Tennes-
see had opposed the appointment of political parti-
sans on the comm.Uee, asd had intimated
that he (Mr G) seemed to wish it This,
however, was not the proper inference to
draw from his remarks He was as much
opposed to having political partisans on
the committee as the gentleman himself, but he
desired to have it so constituted as to embrace
men of some weight of ohaiacter, and to be
composed of men who would do ju-tice to all the
inteiests concerned He wished to see the rights
of all the officers who weie engaged m that service
piotected, and the investigation to be conducted in
such manner as to be of some practical benefit,
and with thii view he had submitted the amend-
ment now under consideration
Sir, snid Mr G the situation m which I stand to
thi ex-President of the United States, w ill not per-
mit me to pass over m silence the bitter denuncia-
tions which have been uttered against him on this
floor by gentlemen of the opposition My attach-
ment for him was formed at an early period of
mv life, under peculiar circumstances, and the most
trying scenes, and it gives me pleasure to say, tint
there are but few acts of his whole life, eitner civil
or military, which has not served to increase, rather
than to dimmish that attachment But to what
souice shall I trace this violent opposition to him?
the bit'er invectives which have been heaped upon
him, emanating from the moH bitter feelings
Sir, to his hostility to the Bank of the United
States, to the veto which he stamped upon the
bill recharfering that institution m 1831!, fee-
cause he had the moral courage to effect that which
his friendsm this Hou>e failed to effeet, because he
threw himself in the breach, and armed with the vir-
tue and integrity of the people, and sustained by the
Constitution, grappled with the monster, and tri-
umphantly overthrew it. This, sir, " is the head
and front of all his offending," and to this eause
alore may be traced the vindictive feelings of his
adversaries But, sir, we hail that act as the
greatest in his political career, one that has covered
him with glory, and one that will serve to pernetu-
ate his name and his memory, even if unconnected
with any other act of his life Sir, the character
of Andrew Jackson is the pioperty of his country,
his sen ices are too well known lo that couBtry not
to be appreciated, they have secured to him the
affections of the people, which the combinations of
his enemies can never deprive him of
Permit me (said Mr G ) here to state, that he was
in hopes he w ould not have found it necessary to
vindicate the character of one needing no vindica-
tion, but my feelings, under the circumstances,
could not and can not be controlled I listened
with pain and regret to the uncalled for and un-
qualified abuse of him " I heard much declama-
tion without argument," and the foulest charges
without proof, and especially from one from whom
it was but little expected I mean the gentleman
from Massachusetts, (Mr. Cu«hing,) who spoke
m relation to the Florida war, and who pio-
nounced that war as one of the damning sins
of the Government, and a foul blot on the Ameri-
can character, this, too, before an investigation
w as had, thereby prejudging the case, and charging
it home upon General Jackson Betler things
were expected from that quarter For my part, I
have always listened to him with the gieatest
pleasure His arguments have generally been
respectful and able, and free from personal abuse,
but, in the present case, he has wandered from his
usual couise, and 1 envy him not the position he
occupied on that occasion Many others have
been lavish of their abuse of thu ex-Pres dent and
of his measures, but I shall not slop specially to
reply to them I feel no disposition to do so, as it
will be an unnecessarj consumption of the time of
this House, but must invoke the pardon of the
House for making a general fire at the whole
flock, and tell them that the numerous squibs they
have fired will have about as much efleet upon ins
character of Andrew Jaskson before the people of
this nation, as the firing of pop-guns would have
upon the rigging of the splendid Pennsvlvama
Sj, said (Mr G ) that venerable patrio, never
expected, and never asked forgiveness at the hands
of his enemies He knew hp had incurred their
eternal displeasure He never expected quarters
from those whose pride and pleasure had been
to embitter his declining ve?rs, whose objects
were to thwart the views of his administration m
every prominent measure, to triumph m the mis-
fortunes of their Government, to rejoice in the dis-
tresses of the people, and to prevent as far as possi-
ble the relief of those distiesses, with a v lew to tne
overthrow of the administration, and to ride them-
selves mlo pow er m the midst of these distresses
In conclusion, sir, and as the time advances when it
is expectedhe will make hu final exif'to that bourne
from whence no traveller returns," and as the time
approaches when we may expect to hear "that
he has slept the sleep of death," and closed
his earthly career, I wish to be permitted to
say to those influenced by such feelings, and
controlled by such motives, looking as he does to
his country's gosd, he has never been inclined to
hold commun'on with, or extend to them the hand
' of fellowship
Mr CAMBRELENG here called for the orders
of the day
M) ADAMS hoped the gentlemen would with-
draw the motion to permit him to address a few
remarks to the House
The question being taken, the House refused to
proeeed to the orders of the day—ayes 84 noes 96
Mr ADAMS opposed the reference of this sub-
ject to the Military Committee first on the ground
that out of nine members of which that conamittee
was composed, eight ol them to use the langage of
the gentleman from Virginia, (Mr Wise,) were the
friends of power, and second, because only one of
the nine came fiom the States north and vvest of
Virginia
He was also opposed to leaving the selection of
the committee to the Chair, and adduced and read
eopious extracts from the journals, dur ng the pre-
sidency of the present Speaker, in suppoi t of the
point to show that such an appointment ought not
to be committed to him
Mr A was m favor of the appointment by bal
lot, or to secure the appointment of such a commit-
tee, the majority of whom would be favorable to
the investigation He earnestly called upon the
House to follow out th spractice, a practice which
had always prevailed in the Bnti h parliament
On motion of Mr CAMBRELENG, the House
then passed to the oiders of the day
DEPOSITE BANKS
The SPEAKER laid before t-e House a com-
munication from the Secretary of the Treasury,
transjnitting a statement of the balances of public
money remaining m the deposite banks, which, on
motion of Mr SMITH, was ordered to lie on the
table, and be printed
TREASURY NOTE BILL
The House then resumed the consideiation of
the " bill to authorize the issuing of Treasuiy
notes," as reported from the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union.
The question pending, was on agieemg to the
amendment of Mr UNDERWOOD, as modified
by the amendment of Mr PATTON (given in
another column )
Mr BOND addressed the House m «upport of
the amendment, and in opposition to the bill
Mr McKIM denied that the sale of the United
States Bank bonds would bring an immediate sup-
ply of money into the Treasurj, for, in the fiist
place, there must, at least, be a delay of four or
five months expended in the negotiation, at a pro
bable loss tuo of from four to bix per cent and
then the Government wonld be likely to get m
return only bank notes He was not unfuendly
towards any banks, but it should be borne in
mind that the Secretary of the Treasury could not
pay out bank notes, they wonld be useless to the
Treasury
Another consideration was, that the bonds given
by the bank wete for two millions each, an amount
that would be incofrweníentto líegotiate m London,
