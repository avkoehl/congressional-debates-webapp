late collector of New Yoik bi lc'eind to a select
committee, and so much as itlated to the revenue
laws to that on Ways md Means
Mi   C  íemaiked that, m making thefiist mo-
J tion, winch he íegirded as one eiemanding the
I es elusive tonsideration  of a committee, it was
1 pi opt 1 for him to state that he did it with no de-
j sign of acting upon tiie committee himself in any
capacity     On tiie contrarj, chaigcd as he was
with the laborious duties on anothei committee,
he could scaicely devote the lequisite time   and,
lrdt pendent of that consideration, it would  be
much more satisfactory to him tnatthe membeis
should come fiom adifttientcj lartti of the Union
than Mr  C  did
Mr  MERCER applauded the smut and can
