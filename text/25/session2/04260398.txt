standard of the foreign exchanges, or to appoint
commissioners under the Government to regulate
the issues of the Bank of England according to this
standard This plan included the suppression of
all joint stock and private banks, as banks of issue,
so that there should be but one bank of issue
throughout the kingdom
It was found by experience, on a late memora-
ble occasion, during the yeai 1836 that the Bank
of England, with an actual capital of about seven-
ty millions of dollars, had wholly failed in the at-
tempt to curtail the issues of the joint stock and pri-
vate hanks In proportion as she contracted, they
expanded, and her diminished issue was more
than suppl ed by then increase This proved, by
the way, how wholly incompetent the Sena-
tor's Bank of the United States would be
to regulate the issues of the State banks All
this experience is as to bit disregarded, and
instead of appor'iomng ihe paper currency of the
country to its specie, ínstsad of making the sign
bear some reasonable propoi tion to the thing sig-
nified, ins'ead of regulating its amount by our
foreign exchanges, we were to adopt the new rule
of New York, and to make bank notes the repre-
sentative of State stocks Ev en m New York they
had required eleven pence m the dollar to be held
in specie, but the Senil i' pioject did not even
contain this restriction Trie end of all under the
new system, w ould probiblj he that the paper cur-
rency of the country would be expanded to a more
enormous extent than it had even jet been, the
prices of every domestic article would rise to such
a pitch that it would be profitable to export
nothing, unless it might be cotton, and to import
every thing—the foreign exchanges would thus ne-
cessarily be against us—the elevenpence in the
dollar would soon be drawn from the vauits
of the banks for exportation, and the holdeis of
the«e notes would be compelled to resort to a suit
in chancery to have the Slates stocks held by the
banks converted in o specie for their redemption
Should a Bank of the tinned Stales be ever esta-
blished, as he trusted it never might, it ought to be
founded upon far different principles Above all,
care should be taken so to regulate and restrict its
charter, if that were possible, that it might at all
limes be able to redeem its notes in specie
The Senator had said that, during the whole pe-
riod of forty yeais, whilst the old and the new
Bank of the United States were m existence,
they hnd regulated the domestic exchanges of the
country in perfection Now, said Mr B under
the pressure oí existing evils, we are prone to
believe that every thing had been comparatively
good in former days Under this impression he had
recently examined into the condition of our domes-
tic exchanges under the reign of the old and the
new Bank, and somewhat to his astom hmem had
found that they were as much, or nearly as much,
deranged during those periods, as in almost any
other portion oí our history The issues of the
State banks had not been controlled, nor the de-
preciation of their notes prevented, by e ther Bank
of the United States Had he anticipated this de-
bate, he should Lav e brought some oí these state-
ments with him to the Senate.
The Senator believed that the power of Congress
to establish a bank had been settled by former pie-
cedents in such a manner that it ought no longer to
be contested He differed entirely from him on
this question Whilst the old Bank exis ed, sanc-
tioned as it was both by legisla ive and judicial au-
thority, it became the duty oi every good citizen to
submit to the law which created it, no matter what
mav have been his individual opinion as to its con
stitutionality But the old chartei had expired, and
the question wis to be brought before a new Con-
gress whioh Lad never decided it Shall we then
be the slaves of p u*\onty, and blindly submit to
former precedents, 01 shall we not be permitted to
exercise our own judgment, and ask where was Ae
provision m the Constitution whichsanctioned these
precedents' He, for one, should be glad to see the
gentleman point it out Wheie did this povvei
lurk' The Senator had already acknowledged that
u was not to bi found either m the power to regu-
late commerce or to coin money. In this particular
lie differed from the Senator from Massachusetts,
[Mr Webster] If the Senator fiom Kentucky
could find it any where, it must be m the power to
levy and collect faxes, and to pay the debts of the
United States. This was the clause on which the
Supreme Court mainly lehed, and they merely de-
cided that if Congress believed a Bank of the United
States to be a necessary and propel means of col-
lecting the revenue and paying the debts of the
country, it was for 'is to determine that question;
and that, unless in an extreme case, the Judiciary
ought not to declare s ich a decision oi Congress to
be a violation of the Constitution The Supreme
Court have thereiore referred it to Congress to de-
cide whethei a bink be a necessary and proper
means of executing the taxing and debt-piying
power And can any man say, at the present day,
that the dues of the Government cannot be conve-
niently collected, and its debt  paid, without the
agency of a Bank oí the Unued Slates? The
very decision of the Supreme Court on which
the Senator relied, had thus referred this
question to Congress, and declared that we,
and not they, were the appropriate judges, un-
less in extreme cases, of the necessity of creating
a National Bank. Under the Constitution, Con-
gress have nothing to do either with the regulation
of the foreign or domestic exchanges The power
to erróte a bank, if it existed at all, was to be
found in (he fixing power and  here alone
To be the slaves of precedent in such a case
would be to abandon the cause of human liberty,
Every new precedent would be anew and impreg-
nable bulwark against the rights oí the people,
from which fresh assaults might be made and new
v clones achieved, until at last the commentaries
upon the Corstitution would destroy its text,
and render us a consolidated people Why,
sir, the judiciary decided ihe sedition law to
be constitutional, and our cilizens were tried, con-
demned, and punished, under its provisions
Would the Senator contend that this precedent
should bind the consciences of membeis oí Con-
gress, and compel them to admit, in all future
time, that a new sedition Hw would be constitu-
tional' Certainly not At this very session, the
Senate, without any < pposmoii, had determined to
refund a fine inflicted under Ihe old sedition law
by the Judiciary, solely upon the punciple, as lie
believed, that it was unconstitutional But it was
not his intention to enter fully into the argument
of this question He had risen merely to make
a few suggestions in relation to the location and
some of the features of the gentleman's bank
Mr NORVELL, from the Committee of Claims,
reported a bill for the relief of the heirs of Thomas
Powell read, and ordered to a second reading
Mt WRIGHT, from the Committee on Finance,
reported the bill referred to it making appropn-
ations for the naval service for 1838, and gave no-
tice that he should call it up to-morrow morning,
at an early hour.
Mr TIPTON, on leave, introduced a bill to le-
move the office of the Surveyor General for Ohio,
Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin   read  twice,
and referred
BANKS IN THE DISTRICT Or COLUMBIA.
The Senjte resumed the consideration of the bill
to continue the corpoiate existence of th> banks m
the District ol Columbia for Iwenty years
The question being on Mr Nin ss amendment,
making the president and directois of the respect-
ive banks personally responsible for all losses to
tne community on the winding up of the banks—
The question was put, and ihe amendment lost
yvithout a debate, and without a division.
Mr BENTON said with the permission of the
Senate, he would r-odi'y the substitute offered by
himself for the original bill If adopted, it would
save much of the time of the Senate Tne c!nng«
he had reference to, yyas merely in relation to the
dates, he had consulted several members, and he
believed his present proposnon would not only
meet the view s of the Senate generally, but he be-
lieved it would be acceptable to those most ínte-
res ed The conditions imposed were such as
could not be objected to he thought    They were—
1 That they should cease receiving or paying
out of all paper for currency of a less denomination
than five dollar on or before the promulgation, of
this act
2.  That they should cease paying out the notes
of other banks from and after the 1st of October
next.
3.  That thev should redeem in specie all their
notes of five dollars and under, from and after the
1st of August next
4.  That they should redeem all their notes in
full, in specie, fiom and after the 1st of January,
1839.
Mr. HUBBARD said he would very much pre-
fer the proposition offered by himself on a former
occasion. He was averse to the renewal of their
charters being restricted by the conditions imposed
by the Senator. He thought it would be better to
leave them free and independent in their action,
and charter them during the pleasure of Congress,
subject to its will
Mr WRIHT spoke at some length against the
original bill, he could not reconcile it to his views
of right, to renew these charters for twenty j ears,
when they werem open violation of the laws, and
had long since forfeited their chaiters by their own
acts. He greatly preferred the motion of the Sena-
tor frein Missouri, [Mr. Benton.] Why even gne
them an extension of two years, unless you
impose these wholesome restrictRns' Did ?ny
S"na or desire to protect them in the open viola-
tion of their charters in the issue of notes of less
denomination than $5? Were we calling upon
them too soon for the redemption of tneu small
notes, or for a general redemption of all fieir
notes? He wished Senators to look at the restric-
tions proposed, and ask themselves if they yvere
too severe Much had been said in that body or
of an irredeemable paper, it was what was con-
demned by all, ind proper efforts should be made
to put an end to it The Senator from New Hamp-
shire say she would prefer a charter at the pleasure
oí Congiess He knew the Senator's reasons,
which he believed would be considered mc-t ame
horating, but m his, Mr W's mind, it would be the
very wor course that could be pursued, and it
once adopted, their charters would never be reach-
ed again Let us extend no greater limits to these
institutions than the States generally do to theirs,
and ihis w e have done
Mr HUBBARD then contended that his pro-
position would be preferable, that if the banks
were left to the action of Congress, their charters
dependenf on iu will, thev would be less likely
to do any thing that would bring on them the con-
demnation oí that b< dy or of the citizens
Mr ROANE defended the bill as originally
drafted The committee had endeavored to draw
all the light they could around them in relation to
the most approved system of banking In reply
to a remark he hid heard, that we knew nothing of
the condition of these banks, he could state that
they had been subject to a severe and rigid scrutiny,
the result of which was before the Senate, and he
trusted the bill would be permitted to pass without
further discussion
Mr BENTON thought as much indulgence was
granted in the substitute as was reasonable and
just. The charters were already forfeited and
1} tng at our mercy Six banks in this District wee
circulating money which would ultimately fail in
the hands of the poor laborer He would not vete
for any thing not coupled with the restrictions he
pioposed
Mr DAVIS opposed the substitute as containing
provisions calculated to destroy the business of the
banks, in relation to paying out the notes of other
institutions
Mr TIPTON «poke eirnestly m favor of placing
the people of inc. District above the embarrassing
uncertainty with which th°y had heretofore been
agi'ated in relation to their banks He desired the
Senate to decide promptly whether they w ould d(
so ir not, and, with this view, he shou'd vote
against all amendments to this bill
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, spoke in favor of the
amendment, and in opposition t<> a recharter 'r,
twenty years, that Congress might revi-e the pie-
sent system, or make a better
Mr NORVELL said, that he had an araend
meat to submit to the amendment proposed to the
