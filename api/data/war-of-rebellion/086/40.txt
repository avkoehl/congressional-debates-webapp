Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE KLINGE,

Commanding Post, Hermann, MO.:

If you shall have good reason to believe your post is in danger call on Brigadier-General Pike, at Washington, who is instructed to furnish you such help as he thinks you need. I do not regard it as probable that Bill Anderson will cross the river, and am quite sure he has no artillery.

LA MINE BRIDGE, October 17, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

I have just received a report from General Sanborn and have sent a special courier to bring him back to this side of Blackwater to watch Price. I have one brigade at Sedalia; the remainder of my command is at this point. I will not move until more is known of Price. An officer of General Sanborn's command reports a small rebel cavalry force marching on California, &amp;c. I have a regiment at Tipton and a cavalry brigade is at California.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 17, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major General A. J. SMITH:

Dispatch this a.m. received. Lambert left Boonville yesterday and arrived here last night. The general impression was that Price had gone to Lexington and that a portion of his force, with artillery, had captured Glasgow day before yesterday. Winslow's Second Brigade will reach California to-night. Pleasonton goes out this a.m. Your orders to Sanborn approved. It would be well to push a reconnaissance. to Marshall. La Mine is not fordable for the first twelve
