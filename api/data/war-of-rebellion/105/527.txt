FORT BRAGG, July 3, 1861.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I arrived at Fort Humboldt on the morning of the 25th ultimo and inspected the post that day. I had to wait another day for means of transportation, and on the 27th started for Lieutenant Collin's camp, about sixty miles southeast of Humboldt; thence on to Lieutenant Martin's camp and to this post. I arrived here night before last and inspected the post yesterday. This morning I am starting back to reach Fort gaston; thence to Ter-Waw, Crescent City, and Fort Crook, including in my route other detachments from the posts in this region of country. I find this arrangement the most convenient that I can adopt to accomplish the wishes of the general commandidng the department. I shall reserve my detail report until I have completed the tour. By that time I shall have passed through the entire region in which the Indians are said to be troublesome, and can report more advisedly on that subject. Upward of 200 Indians (men, with a few accidental exceptions), have been killed by the different detachments. Presuming that this slaughter is to stip some point short of extermination, for the alleged depredations of the Indians would hardly justify that, I have ventured to advise the officers in command to discontinue it now until other depredations are committed, excepting, however, with reference to the band which recently killed two men (Lewis and Oliver) at Shelter Cove, on the coast. That is a legitimate ground for severe chasitsement, and I have advised the officers to direct their efforts
