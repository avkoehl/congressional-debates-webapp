Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Under permission to mount infantry, do you not think we could mount these picked men, organized into light battalions? It is for the interest of the service to mount picked men, and it adds nothing to their rank or pay. Me I beg you to look into the legality of the matter yourself? Observe, it does not detach them permanently from their regiments.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Have nothing new to-day. The excessive rain of yesterday and day before flooded the country. One of our railroad bridges was destroyed, and two others slightly damaged. General Dodge's cavalry has captured Tuscumbia, with 200 prisoners and a quantity of stores, and are in pursuit of their scattered forces. It is said by a shrewd man, who left Shelbyville yesterday, that the rebel troops were ordered to cook four days' rations. Our defensive works here are well advanced. A brigade will be able to cover the depots and bridges against a division or two. Forage represented as being scarce about Shelbyville. They say they foraged for 50 miles, and provisions are so scarce that bacon is $ 50 per hundred.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

May I ask you to do the service and this army the favor of reconsidering your decision on that part of my order about forming light battalions out of the rolls of honor? You have given permission to mount infantry to meet the exigencies of this service. If we mount any, they should be picked men. The light battalions are not intended to be organizations in any such sense as to affect their pay or to take them
