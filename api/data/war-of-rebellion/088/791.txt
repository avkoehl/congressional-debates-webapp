Captain MICHIE,

Chief Engineer, Headquarters General Butler:

It is reported to me that a heavy rifled shell from Howlett house battery penetrated the cover of the magazine at Crow's Nest to within a foot of the chamber, where it burst. I have never thought this magazine secure, and would request that at least three feet be added to the exposed end.
