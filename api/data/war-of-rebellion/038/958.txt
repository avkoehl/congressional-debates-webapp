GENERAL JOSEPH E. Johnston:

The enemy bombards the city day and night from seven mortars on opposite side of peninsula. He also keep up constant fire on our lines with artillery and sharpshooters. We are losing many officers and men. I am waiting most anxiously to know your intentions; have heard nothing of you or from you since 25th May. I shall endeavor to hold out as long as we have anything to eat. Can you not send me a verbal message by a courier, crossing the river above or below, and swimming across again opposite Vicksburg?

J. C. PEMBERTON.

(Repeated June 12.)

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE, Richmond, Va June 10, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Comdg., &amp;c., Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: Northern papers report the reduction of Hunter's forces by sending troops to the Gulf. If this be true, you will, such force as you can properly withdraw from your defensive line, proceed to Mobile, to resist an attack, if one should be designed at that place, but if the purpose of the enemy, be to send his re-enforcements to the Mississippi, you will go on and co-operate with General Johnston in that quarter.

By direction of the President:

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER.
