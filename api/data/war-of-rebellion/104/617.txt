AUGUSTA, May 5, 1865.

Major-General WILSON:

Jeff. Davis, with six millions of specie in wagons and with an escort reported from 2,000 to 4,000 strong, is making his way through North Georgia, toward Trans-Mississippi. You are supposed to be co-operating to intercept him. An officer from First Cavalry Division, Department of the Cumberland, is here. Infantry and cavalry are both on track.

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Macon, Ga., May 5, 1865.

Bvt. Major General E. UPTON,Augusta, Ga.:

Telegram received in regard to J. D. My real object in sending your division to Atlanta was to assist in apprehending him. If you have any real clue send it to Eggleston at once, and take measures accordingly. Our scouts have been out for several days. Winslow marched from here early this morning; shall hurry him forward. If you have any positive information in regard to the possible route send me word to-night.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

AUGUSTA, May 5, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WILSON:

Jeff. Davis left Washington, Ga., at 3 a.m. to-day. The march of the Fourth Division might be hastened to the point you have ordered it. The Leesburg with supplies is here at the dock. Its supplies might be sent on at once to fill the pack train, and then operations commenced. Its march would naturally be toward the point where the corps is ordered. Your last dispatch I have not seen, but will in a few minutes and will answer.

E. UPTON,

Brevet Major-General.

AUGUSTA, GA., May 5, 1865.

Major-General WILSON,

Macon:

From several sources I learn that Jeff. Davis left Washington either this morning or yesterday morning. Had 150 men when he entered; left with six, so stated. Direction supposed to be Marietta, Talladega. Palmer's cavalry division, Department of the Cumberland, is at Athens, and scouts are in every direction; $100,000 in gold as a reward for his apprehension and delivery to the U. S.military authorities, promptly distributed in North Georgia and Alabama, is the surest means of securing his arrest. If you will issue it or allow me to do it I can have it printed to-night and sent by rail to Eggleston by to-morrow night; and if he has his horses at Atlanta, I will give instructions that will secure its distribution over North Georgia and Alabama in advance of Davis' passage through the country.
