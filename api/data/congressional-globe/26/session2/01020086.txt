LUNA1ICS   IN TiiE DISTRICT OF   CO-

the expenses of th°ir removal, and cf their main-
tenance is said asylu n, pnd be illowed for the
same in the settlement of h s account at trie Trea-
sury of the United State*
Mr CUSHING did not understand why the
Corporation of Washington could not take care ot
their own poor. If the lunatics were paupers,
why were they confined m the common jail' There
was an alms house in the city, m which they could
be confined
Mr JOHNSON would answer the question of
tli3 gentleman from Massachusetts The reason
why the corporate au horities did not place these
maniacs among the paupers,, was because of the
rammest peril thai would thereby be occasioned
There were now twe've lunaiica m prison with
cotnmsn crim rials Tüe luna'ie a-ylum in Balti-
more was willing to receive the lunatics at moderate
prices Common sympathy, sail Mr J called for
relief
Mr CUSHING sa.d he hal understood that
those lunatics we'e without the common necessa-
r es of hf<?, and were obliged to he upon the prison
ílooi Mr C had been told that the circumstances
of the case called on th= House for relief If this
bill was the only mode of affording relief, he would
perhaps be willirg to stretch a point, but he de-
sired to know whose fault it wa  that the evil ex-
ís'cd
Mr JOHNSON said that the corporation of
this city gave two dollars per week for the sup-
pirt of these lunatics, and that was all it eould af-
ford Bu' m the restoration of the i health, their
minds might b° restored This was a higher mo-
tive than dol'ais and cents, and this mas the motive
f h ch had induced the committee to report the
bill.
Mr HUBBARD moved to amend the bill, by
J Uhn  the following
" Prov ded, That it slnll bo done at the expense
(l th« cit) authorities "
Mi HUBBARD said thai, in his opinion, this
was a subject which shou'd be le't >o the autho-
rities of the city The people's representatives
Wire not there to regulate the poor houseo of the
District, and it seemed to him that, if the provi-
sions of the bid were carried out, all the poor of
lurruunding country would come here to profit
by it
Mr JOHNSON said the bill was not intended foi
piupers, but for lunatics
Mr HUBBARD replied that there could be no
diifeience between them, in the pnnc pie of ex-
panse
Mr JOHNSON remarked that the counties took
caie of paupers, and the Sta'ts ot lunat cs Con-
fess was thp local legislature of the District, and
Mr J asked v, hether it would not act its part.
The expen e3 would b° triilmer in comparison to
ti c cemort whicn would be oestowed He trusted
that the gentleman from Alaba na would withdraw
his anKndm-nt
