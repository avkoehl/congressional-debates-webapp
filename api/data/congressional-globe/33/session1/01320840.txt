THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 3,
Again, sir, instead of applying the pruning hook
to the poor postmasters throughout the country,
apply it to the ocean mail steamer service. It is a
homely maxim, but nevertheless a true one, that it
is poor economy to "stop the leak at the spicket,
and leave the waste at the bung-hole."
Sir, you had a contract with E. K. Collins &
Co., for the transportation of the United States
mail between New York and Liverpool, at $19,250
the round trip. The last Congress, notwithstanding
I thought it my thity as the chairman of the Post
Office Committee to inform the House that there
were responsible offers before that committee to
perform the service at $10,000 the round trip,
raised the compensation to $33,000 the trip. Thus
voting away, to one single company, consisting,
as I am told, mostly of foreign stockholders, need-
lessly and wantonly, $100,000 moie than I am
desirous to obtain for these twenty-three thousand
postmasters, as an adequate reward for the ser-
vices which they actually render to the country.
Again, sir, if the Post Office Department is to be
made a self-sustaining branch of the Government,
instead of applying the pruning hook to the post-
masters, apply itto your railroad companies, who,
notwithstanding they nearly swallow up the whole
revenues of the Department, are, like the daugh-
ter of the horse leech, continually crying, " Give!
give!!"
But, Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as when the bills
reported from the Committee on the Post Office and
Post Roads relative to the railroad and ocean mail
steamer service shall come up for consideration, I
shall iiave occasion to dwell more at length upon
these abuses, I will not further discuss them at this
time.
In refutation of this position taken by the Post-
master General, it is sufficient for me to advert to
the fact that Congress, in the act of 3d March, 1851,
reducing the postage of mailable matter to its
present low rates, distinctly placed upon record its
abandonment of the policy of making the Post
Office Department a self-sustaining Department.
It was then urged, as an argument against the
reduction of postage, that you would be compelled
to reduce the mail facilities of the countiy, and cut
down the compensation of postmasters, or, other-
wise, make the Post Office Department a charge
upon the National Treasury.
Now, I maintain, Mr. Speaker, that, in the sixth
and seventh sections of the act, of the 3d March,
1851, Congress pledged itself that thecompensation
of postmasters should not be cut down, and the
mail facilities of the country should not he reduced,
in consequence of the reduction of postages.
The sixth section of that act, as 1 have already
shown, authouzed and required the Postmaster
General to estimate the compensations of deputy
postmasters, by the commissions received by them
during the year preceethng the taking eil'eet of that
act. Nay, sir, itdtd not stop at that, but actually
allowed an increase of twenty per cent., as shown
in the proviso to that section, which is in these
words:
" Provided, That the whole amount of commission al-
lowed stu.h pn>tin,inters. <!ui iiie; uny >''ar Miall not exceed
by more than twenty per cent the amount of commi^ioriri
nt such otliee for the year ending the 30th June, 1851."
The seventh section of that act is, perhaps, a
more explicit abandonment of the policy referred
to than is the sixth. It is as follows:
" Slc. 7. Jlnd bo it fuitkcr caartcd, That no post office
now m exigence .-hall he dtt>contnineiI, nor ^luili the mail
service on any mail route in any of the States ni Ten Ho-
nes i>e discontinued ot dnnuu.-hed, in eoiif-eqtience of any
diminution of the icvenues that may K-Milt fiom linn act:
oud it I)'" the duty of the I'ohtma.-ter General to estab-
lish new po<t office-, n nil place the mail ^ei vice on any new
mail routes established, oi that may heieaffei he established,
in the same manner ha though ihu< act had not p.tbted."
These sections of the act of 3d March, 1851,
demonstrate, beyond the possibility of a doubt,
the abandonmentof the policy of making the Post
Office Department a gplf-sustaining department of
the Government. They also demonstrate the
pledge of Congress, that the compensation of
deputy postmasters should not be reduced by the
reduction of postage.
Permit me next to show, sir, that the bill which,
by order of the Post Office Committee, I have re-
ported, does not increase the compensation be-
yond the amount received for the year ending the
30th June, 1851.
That I might be enabled to keep the proposed
inciease within the limits prescribed by the act of
the 3d March, 1851, which 1 regard and shall con-
sider as the pledge of Congress, given to the deputy
postmasters of the country, the Post Office Depart-
ment, in accordance with my request,has furnished
me with the statement which i now send to the
Clerk to be read:

I *The«-e sums include the average amount of additional
; compensation allowed under the sixth section of the act of
| March 3, 1851.
I The first statement exhibits the compensation
; to postmasters and clerks for two years preceding
I and two years succeeding the taking effect of the
' act of the 3d March, 1651. But inasmuch as it
| em bi aces only one quai ter, namely, the last quarter
of the last year m which postmasters were paid
in accordance with their reduced commissions, it
is of but little importance.
The second statement is the one to which I de-
sire to call the attention of the House. It exhibits
the compensation to deputy postmasters for the
first quarter m each of the years named. The
quarter ending the 30th September, 1853, being
under the operation ot the act of the 3d March,
1853, demonstrates the reduction made in the com-
pensation of postmasters by the provisions of that
act.
Nov/, Mr. Speaker, I will ask the Clerk to read
another communication from the Postmaster Gen-
eral, and then we shall be prepared to proceed with
our deductions and conclusions:
post oi'ftc f di'pauthfst, March 8, 18"4.
My dkar Sir : Pursuant to jour request, I have the
pleasure of tfiving v on below a statement of the number of
post oilices and postmasters m the United States on the 30tll

I do not propose, Mr. Speaker, troubling the |
House with a calculation showing the average
compensation to each postmaster for each of the
fiscal years embraced in the foregoing statements.
: These exhibits will be published with my re-
marks, and thus each gentleman will be furnished
! with data upon which to make his own calcula-
! tion.
It will be sufficient for me to show what was
; the average compensation to each postmaster in
| one quarter of the year ending the 30th June,
i 1851, and for a corresponding quarter in thepres-
! ent fiscal year, in order to demonstrate the reduc-
tion which has been made by the operation of the
, law of last Congress—the law complained of, and
which the bill now under consideiation proposes
to remedy.
V.The estimates given me by the Postmaster Gen-
' eral are the quarters ending the 30th September in
each year. The compensation to postmasters for
the quarter ending the 30th September, 1850,
being the fiscal year referred to in the act of the
3d March, 1851, was §414,438 56. The whole
number of postmasters that year was eighteen
thousand four hundred and seventeen. This
' would give a compensation to each postmaster of
$21 96 per quarter. Take the corresponding
quarter of the present fiscal year, and the com-
: pensation to postmasters for the quarter ending
the 3Uth September, 1853, was £389,054 60. The
1 number of postmasters was twenty-two thou-
' sand three hundred and twenty. The average
; compensation was $17 43 per quarter to each post-
j master.
! Now, sir, add to thw the increase made by the
bill now under consideration, according to the
estimate made by the Auditor of the Post Office
Department, and the average compensation would
be $20 75 to each postmaster per quarter—being
§1 21 per quarter to each postmaster less than the
amount allowed by the act of March 3, 1851.
Thus, sir, I havedemonstrated beyond all doubt,
by the estimates and facts submitted to the Post
Office Committee by the Postmaster General him-
self, that the bill which 1 have reported, should it
become a law, will still leave the average compen-
sation of the deputy postmasters full 12 per cent,
below what it was under the act of March 3, 1851.
But I m/iy, perhaps, be told that the bill under
consideration proposes to eive the Postmaster
General power to make still further compensation
to the postmasters of distributing and separating
post offices,and that, as a consequence, it will vary
the computation above submitted, and greatly in-
crease the average.
From the data furnished by The Postmaster
Geneial and the Auditor of the Post Office De-
partment, this increased compensation to distrib-
uting and separating offices can be brought into
the computation and reduced to a eeitainty.
Both the Postmaster General and the Auditor
say that $25,000, or, at the outside, §35,000 for the
distributing, and $20,000 for the separating offices,
beyond their present compensation, will be amply
sufficient for the extra allowances to these two
classes of postmasters.
By reference to the estimate of the Auditor, you
will perceive that the two and a half per cent, in-
creased commission on distribution at distributing
offices—allowed in the bill under consideration—
amounts to $6,140 75 per quarter or $24,599 per
annum. Deducting this amount from the $55,000,
estimated by the Postmaster General and Auditor
for the Post Office Department, will leave $30,401
per annum, or $7,600 25 per quarter to be added
to the average of $20 75 to each postmaster; this
will increase the average to $21 13—provided the
bill under consideration becomes a law. This is
still an average of nearly one dollar less per quar-
ter than the compensation contemplated by the
act of the 3d March, 1351.
Make still another calculation, if you please, sir,
and it will show the same result. Under the oper-
ation of the act of the 3d March, 1851, the average
compensation to the deputy postmasters was
$2i 96 per quarter, or $87 84 perannum. Under
the law of the last Congress, the average compensa-
tion was reduced to $17 43 per quarter, orto §69 72
per annum, being an average deduction of $16 12
per annum to each postmaster. There being
twenty-three thousand postmasters in the United
States, would make the sum total of reduction
amount to $370,760.
The bill first agreed upon by the Post Office
Committee, the Postmaster General informs us,
would increase the pay of all the postmasters
$302,944 35. To this amount add the $30,401,
the estimated increase at distributing and separa-
ting offices, and the sum total of increase will be
$333,345 35 cents, being still $37,414 65cents less
than the aggregate compensation to the deputy
postmasters would be, if estimated and allowed by
the act of the 3d March, 1851.
Now, Mr. Speaker, such are the facts, even
upon the estimates and figures given us by the
Postmaster General and the Auditor of the Post
Office Department. And 1 des-ure to put the ques-
tion to this House, and let their action upon this
bill speak the answer: Was the promise made
to deputy postmasters bv Congress, m the sixth
section of the act of the 3d March, 1851, in good
faith; or was it a promise <{ made to the ear to be
broken to the hope?"
The Postmaster General, in his communication,
says, that of the twenty-three thousand post offices
in the country, not leas than ten thousand are
held rather for the incidental advantages they
afford than for any profit accruing directly to the
incumbent. Perhyps, sir, it may be true that
thousands of men could be found who would be
willing to hold these offices for their 5{ incidental
advantages." But, for one, I am utterly opposed
to any system of compensation for Government
offices which looks to the st incidentals" as the
reward for a faithful discharge of duty. Perhaps
it may be true that the President of the United
States could find many men willing to hold the
office of Postmastei General for the sake of its
" incidental advantages;" but would that be a
