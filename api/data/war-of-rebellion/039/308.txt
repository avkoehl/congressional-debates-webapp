marked personal bravery. His complete report will show what that brave division did.

Major-General French was not under my immediate command during the morning, but I refer you to his report, together with those of his brigade and regimental commanders, to show how completely the work was done by him and his fine troops. I call attention to the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Morgan, chief of artillery.

Brigadier-General Gibbon, commanding Second Division, having made his report direct to your office, I simply say that he performed well his part, seconded by his division.

The operations of the medical and ambulance corps were very gratifying; only 40 of my wounded were left on the field. Some prisoners were taken from the First Division, as will be seen by General Hancock's report.

The gentlemen of the various department of my staff behaved with their usual gallantry and devotion. It is due to them that their names should be recorded: Lieutenant-Colonel [Francis A.] Walker, assistant adjutant-general (wounded); Lieutenant Colonel Morgan, inspector-general and chief of artillery; Surgeon [Alexander N.] Dougherty, medical director; Surgeon [William H.] Morton, medical inspector; Major [S. Octavius] Bull, provost-marshal; Major [John B.] Burt and Captain [John S.] Schultze and [Lieutenant James N.] potter, aides-de-camp; Captain [Amos T.] Hecock, chief of ambulance corps, and Captain [Edward P.] Brownson, commissary of musters.

Lieutenant-Colonels [Richard N.] Batchelder and [Joseph S.] Smith, chiefs of the quartermaster's and commissary departments, though not in battle, performed their parts well and satisfactory. Captains [Robert E.] Ellerbeck and [Riley] Johnson, also Lieutenants [Lewis] Wetmore and [Daniel C.] Swank, of the cavalry, assisted me in the field, and were valuable aides.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
