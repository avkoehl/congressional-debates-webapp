Willcox, at Wilson's Station, hearing of maraunders on the Nottoway River, sent a detachment in that direction, who suceeded in capturing a camp with several wagons loaded with plunder. The party consisted of negroes, mostly belonging to this army. Some were killed, and the rest made prisoners. I have also heard of parties of maraunders operating to the north of this place, supposed to be stragglers from this and the Confederate army. To pursue and punish, these offenders will require, on my parat, some cavalry force. I understand the Cavalry Corps has been moved to City Point. I would respectfully ask a cavalry force be assigned to this army, and, if practicable, the division which, until the recent operations, was attached to it.
