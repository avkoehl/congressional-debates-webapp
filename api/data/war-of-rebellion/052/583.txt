Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: There should be a pontoon-bridge laid here immediately, which I could do if I had a company of mechanics and the tools necessary. Allow me to ask whether they could not be furnished. There is here much valuable limber suitable for bridgebuilding. If this is needed at Bridgeport, the returning trains could take it there, as they go back empty.
