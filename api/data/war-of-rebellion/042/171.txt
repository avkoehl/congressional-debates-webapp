troops are performing their duties without any evidence of discontent, and I see no reason for any uneasiness at present.*

There are twelve vessels in front of the bar. Two of the twelve are apparently captured vessels, as they have been brought in by a steamer.

The foregoing I wished to telegraph last night; the line being down, it could not be done. Ten vessels are in sight this morning. Everything quiet (12 a.m., Sunday, August 16).

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. N. LUCKETT,

Acting Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MARINE DEPARTMENT,Decrow's Point, Tex., August 16, 1863.

To the Commanding Officer, Indianola, Tex.:

SIR: I have been instructed by the major-general commanding to place the steamer John F. Carr in these waters, under the command of Captain S. K. Brown, for the protection of the island ports of this portion of the coast. Her station will be at Saluria. It is the desire of the commanding general that we abstain from attracting the attention of the enemy by fighting him outside the bay in the present unprepared state of our defenses.

The armament of the steamer John F. Carr consist of one 18-pounder and one 12-pounder howitzers. The men are armed with rifles and cutlasses. In case the enemy should anchor in force outside the bar, I would suggest that you place at least 60 sharpshooters on board.

You will please order the quartermaster and commissary of subsistence of your command to furnish Captain Brown with fuel and provisions on his requisition. It would be well to have a supply of wood upon the wharf.

Yours, respectfully,

LEON SMITH,

Commanding Marine Department of Texas.
