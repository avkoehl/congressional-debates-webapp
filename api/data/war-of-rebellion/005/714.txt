As a general rule it would seem, as is natural, that the ratio of sick is inversely as the military age of the men. When a departure from this rule is perceived, as it will be in certain brigades, one important reason for it will probably be found in the lax and inefficient discipline of the regiment. I called attention to an instance of that sort a few days since, and was told that the regiment was demoralized from the inefficiency of the officers.

I ask attention in this place to a letter I have received from Brigadier-General Peck, a copy of which I inclose to show how much may be done by attention to certain sanitary measures that I have frequently suggested, and which have been more than once directed from your office. If officers could be imprisoned with the necessity of such measures, and convinced of their certain beneficial results, I feel sure they would all be zealous in enforcing them.

I am gratified to be able to state that typhoid fever, which I feared would seriously increase with the cold weather, has been much decreased in a very great majority of the regiments, and upon the whole I think I am justified in saying that the sanitary condition of this army is very satisfactory.

I take this occasion to say that I have sent an inspector of hospitals to Lander's division, and that as soon as the inspections of Alexander's and Duane's commands are completed, I shall send another to Parryville, Md., where I have just learned that typhoid fever has appeared and is increasing in one of the regular regiments stationed at that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. TRIPLER,

Surgeon and Medical Director Army of the Potomac.
