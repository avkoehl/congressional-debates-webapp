SIR: In consequence of ill health, caused by disease contracted in the Mexican war, and aggravated during the present one, I hereby respectfully tender my resignation as major-general of volunteers.

I am, however, admonished that the time has come for me to leave the service, and ask you to accept the above resignation.

That God in His mercy may sustain you is the hope of your obedient servant,
