Are you advised if in force? Did Colonel Mills fall back with his train? You must judge what is best as to holding position. Our primary object now must be to keep fully between the enemy and Saint Louis, doing them all the harm we can. Let me hear from you and manage the cavalry as best you can to watch their movements and compel caution.
W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

De Soto:

Have Colonel Shaw's dispatch of 4.15.* You must see to your rear and don't let the enemy get between you and Saint Louis. Send word to your cavalry to head them off on the State road, and keep them south of the Meramec.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

DE SOTO, September 27, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

The rebels appeared in considerable force near Mineral Point. Colonel Mills has fallen back to Big River bridge with all his train. The rebels burnt South Big River bridge. I expect General Smith here soon. I think a considerable force of rebels is passing west of here out the State, round from Potosi to Saint Louis.

WM. T. SHAW,

Colonel, Commanding Third Division.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

De Soto:

I will send Colonel Merrill to Kirkwood, on the Pacific Railroad, twelve miles from town, advance them to-night and main body in the morning by 6. Is our cavalry so posted that the enemy cannot pass them by a surprise or forced march into the city? Give them the necessary orders to prevent this, and inform them that Colonel Merrill goes to Kirkwood, and telegraph me your dispositions. Colonel Merrill will await your reply before receiving final orders. All news from Girardeau seems to indicate Shelby only, positively. Merrill will scout across south of the Meramec. Let your cavalry know this. Will have 1,800 veterans to-morrow.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

PILOT KNOB, September 27, 1864.

General SMITH:

The train just in will return and take to Mineral Point all the troops yet remaining at Saint Francis bridges, Irondale, or South Big River bridge.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
