A deserter from New Orleans Zouaves, Richmond, ten days since, reports removal of large quantities of stores to Lynchburg. Common rumor among soldiers makes rebel force in and near Richmond 200,000. Came by Lynchburg, Gordonsville, Madison Court-House, and Edenburg. No rebel forces seen or heard of en route. At Lynchburg sick and prisoners, but few troops.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SHENANDOAH,Winchester, Va., June 12-1.30 a. m. (Received 8.35 a. m.)

General Fremont's chief of staff reports that they have beaten Jackson in two engagements and that Shields has been beaten on the opposite side of the river. Jackson has been re-enforced to the number of 30,000 or 35,000 men, including Smith's and Longstreet's divisions, in consequence of which he is falling back to Harrisonburg, on his way to Mount Jackson, where he desires my command to join him. General Sigel's division is in front of Winchester, at Kernstown-6,000 effective men, with ten pieces of artillery. The First Brigade, Williams' division, is on the Shenandoah, opposite Front Royal, and the Third Brigade will be in Winchester to-morrow; total, with cavalry, 6,000 men and twelve serviceable guns. In my opinion Mount Jackson is no place to meet the enemy. Middletown is a point which commands the opening of the three mountain valleys, and either Middletown or Winchester is the place to meet Jackson if he returns to this valley. My opinion is that Fremont should fall back to this line, and I have so suggested to him, in order to keep the enemy from his rear. If we are compelled to meet the enemy here, more artillery and more troops should be sent, if possible. We expect return of messenger in the morning with further advices, and will communicate.

WINCHESTER, June 12, 1862-10.40 a. m.

Your dispatches by Lieutenant Claassen just received.* The condition of affairs has suddenly changed. Fremont is moving to the rear, and calls upon me to support him at Mount Jackson. This from himself. His chief of staff, in dispatch received at 2 o'clock, confirms this and states that Jackson has been re-enforced by Smith and Longstreet to the Extent of 30,000 to 35,000 men to repeat his invasion of the valley. I believe this to be true. It is confirmed by rumors received from all quarters. I repeat it, that the Department may judge the course to
