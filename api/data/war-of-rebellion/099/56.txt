Very respectfully,

Captain C. CADLE, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Seventeenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the reconnaissance I sent out this p.m. found a good road leading to the landing on the Tullifinny-on the opposite side, however, from where the fleet lands supplies for General Foster's command. The landing is seven miles from this place; needs a wharf to enable supplies to be landed. The road is the first left hand one after crossing the Pocotaligo bridge on the Coosawhatchie road.

I am, captain, very truly yours,

M. F. FORCE,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the Major-general commanding.
