KING'S BRIDGE, December 13, 1864-8 a. m.

General SLOCUM:

I have your report, or note, of last night 8 p. m., and think you can make good use of that boat. Don't attempt too much, for a failure of any kind will lead to a reaction; but if the people of Savannah discover us gaining little by little, but surely, it will have a strong effect. The bridge here is now done and is a considerable affair, and Hazen is passing over. I think Fort McAllister, too, will be found a strong work, and, therefore, 	depend on another point which is being examined. Forage, &amp;c., is more plentiful over here, but still it is limited. I cannot imagine what the fleet is about; they may be off on some special errand, or may be expecting us elsewhere. I will go to a point where I can see all the Ogeechee country and Ossabaw Sound. I will be home to-night, or in the course of the night.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. SLOCUM,

Commanding, &c.:

DEAR GENERAL: Take a good big drink, a long breath, and then yell like the devil. The fort was carried at 4. 30 p. m., the assault lasting but fifteen minutes. The general signaled from this side to the fleet and got answers, and vessels were seen coming up the sound when Colonel Ewing left.

I am, General, yours, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,
