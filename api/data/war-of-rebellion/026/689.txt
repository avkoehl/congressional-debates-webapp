FORT MONROE, VA., May 4, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Peck says Longstreet's line of rifle-pits and batteries is not less than 10 miles in extent. Batteries are arranged with embrasures and parapets of 12 or 15 feet thickness. His line was of immense strength. It encircled Suffolk from the Edenton road to the Nansemond.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Major-General Foster is applying for cavalry, and I understand for some of mine. I have but 2,600, and spare none. I have 1,500 at Suffolk, 900 at Williamsburg, and 200 at Norfolk; besides, General Hill is on the Blackwater. General Foster will be undisturbed.

Major-General HOOKER,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

Following just received from General Keyes:

Lieutenant-Commander Gillis, just returned from near West Point, has learned that the rebel force from White House and below, and opposite on the Pamunkey, have been withdrawn to Hanover Court-House. There are troops on this Peninsula, but how many is not known. Nothing has been learned about bridges except that the railroad bridge at the White House still stands.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

May 4, 1863-3.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Peck:

I have in my possession the communication of Major General D. H. Hill to General Longstreet, reporting his arrival at Carrsville, with his entire division 4 miles this side of Carrsville on the 2nd, and awaiting his orders.

A telegram from Major Stratton, just received, confirms this. He says:

The troops from Carolina were ordered to Suffolk on the 2nd, and the wagons to Franklin. Have just returned from a portion of their center line, which would have cost us not less than 2,000 men to have carried. All their lines are strictly in accordance with the rules of besieging army. Hill may commence operations unless demanded elsewhere.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major General.
