Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief, &amp;c.:

SIR: The proposal of the 12th instant, on the subject of paroles, directed by you with the approval of the Honorable Secretary of War, was presented to Mr. Robert Ould by General Meredith on the 24th instant, and was declined; and Mr. Ould submits the following proposal: that--

All paroles on both sides heretofore given shall be determined by the general orders issued by the War Department of the United States, to wit: Numbers 49, Numbers 100, and Numbers 207 of this year, according to their respective dates, and in conformity with paragraph 131 of General Orders, Numbers 100, so long as said paragraph was in force. If this proposition is not accepted I propose that the practice heretofore adopted respecting paroles and exchanges be continued. In other words, I propose that the whole question of paroles be determined by the general orders of the United States, according to their dates, or that it be decided by former practice.

This proposal bears date the 24th of August, at City Point. The questions connected with this matter are respectfully submitted.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major General of Vols. and Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners.
