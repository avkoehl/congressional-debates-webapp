The cavalry sent to Front Royal returned yesterday evening completely exhausted, and reported the roads passed over impassable for any trains. At present, with snow on the ground, the only passable road open to a detachment from this army, viz, the Culpeper and Sperryville pike, is not practicable, from the balling of the snow in the animal's hoofs. I hold the balance of the Sixth Corps, about 10,000 men, a division of cavalry, about 4,000, and some artillery, with a bridge train, in readiness for any movement you may order; but I am still of the opinion that the operations against Early, to be effective, should be from the railroad and defensive, and the character of the season and roads, together with the difficulty of procuring supplies, after exhausting those carried with them, will rendered nugatory any effort made from this army to cut off Early's retreat, as he has a road via Franklin to withdraw to Staunton, in addition to the one through Woodstock. Again, to re-enforce Kelley, if necessary, from this army would require a smaller detachment than an independent movement into the valley, thus weakening me proportionately less. Defensive movements also would have roads, and the troops be more readily supplied. Under existing circumstances, I shall await your orders before making any movement.

Telegram of 12. 30 p. m. received. Mine of 1 p. m. is an answer. Ewell's corps is not in the valley, but Early's command as reported. I have made all the arrangements for a brigade to be sent. Shall I send it at once?

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

January 5, 1864 - 3 p. m. (Received 6 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Up to January 2 the re-enlistments of veteran volunteers amount to 16,189. Of this number there have been sent to their respective States for furloughs and re-organization thirteen regiments, two battalions, and forty-five companies of infantry, two regiments and fifteen companies of cavalry, the whole amounting to 5,000 men. In addition, about 7,000 additional furloughs have been granted, making in all about 12,000 furloughs, and leaving 4,000 to be granted on the return of those now absent. The average furlough is thirty-five days. Should Congress re-allow the bounties to veteran volunteers, and the exigencies of the service permit of furloughs being given, I am of the opinion many more enlistments will be made.

Please communicate the above to the President and Secretary of War:

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
