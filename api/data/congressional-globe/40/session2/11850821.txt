THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

nidation from which they have just emerged.
Of course men will predict a "war of races,"
and expect one, when they pursue the very
course to incite it. Shut him away once more
from your school-houses by law; tear from his
hand the ballot, now that he has learned to
valne it; deprive him of the right of repre-
sentation for himself and a place in the jury-
box ; carry out in this respect your platform
to the fullest extent, and what can be expected
but a war of races? Neither man nor angel
can submit to such a robbery, and the Al-
mighty has no attribute to take the side of the
oppressor.
But it is too late to talk of a " war of races,"
for the victim of your hate and oppression is
now clothed in the garments of American citi-
zenship. You will be slow to make war upon
citizens with the power of the ballot in their
hands and at their command. There is power
enough yet in this Government to protect Amer-
ican citizens.
While I, Mr. President, have spoken of cor-
dially welcoming the return of the States lately
in rebellion when they honestly and fairly come
with a full compliance with the laws made for
their restoration, and while I have no sym-
pathy with the new rebellion which would
keep them out, still I do not mean to say that
I am satisfied to draw a vail over the crimes
of the past and let the guilty leaders go unpun-
ished. I am not for opening every prison door
and making a hero of the chief leader of the
rebellion. Those who voluntarily took up arms
•gainst this Government, it being their own
Government, committed crimes deep enough
and dark enough to condemn a race ; but the
crime of the multitude who followed those who
had the responsibility of leading sinks into in-
significance and whitens almost into'insolence
■when compared with the few leading men who
planned the revolt and led it on to execation.
Why has not the majesty of law and govern-
ment been vindicated? Why have the leaders
gone unwhipped of justiee, while their poor
followers, deluded into •fime, lie bleaching in
half-covered and unmonumented graves, or,
if alive, writhing in the twofold agony of a last
cause and a desolated household ? Sir, with
all my forbearance and anxiety for the return
of the late rebel States, it is my deliberate judg-
ment that it is high time somebody had been
hung for treason. Some blood should have
been shed long before this for the vindication
of justice and violated law. I know we have
bung some for assassination, and the trial of
another is yet to come; but that is not the
crime they committed, and in that they only
were the duped instruments, not the moving
spirit, not the "head center," where all re-
sponsibility pivots and hangs. But even these
tools of the inspiring genius at the head struck
at the life of the President of the United States,
not the inoffensive citizen, Abraham Lincoln.
That pistol-shot was aimed at the head and
life or this Government, and those who con-
federated with Booth were his partners in the
attempt to destroy this Government by strik-
ing at the head of the. President and, at the
same hour of night, at the heads of the De-
partments, showing that their crime was trea-
son, not assassination. It was making war on
this Government, adhering to its enemies, giv-
ing them aid and, for the moment, co'mfort.
Yet during all these three years no wretch has
had a trial for treason, and no conviction has
even been aimed at.
I am expecting, however, that during the
March term of one of our courts we shall have
what I have so long waited for. Instead of
any such thing, the head and front of this, the
greatest crime of the ages, in the person of one
For whose arrest we paid more money as a
reward than we took for his bail, was feasted in
prison, and is now faring sumptuously, I sup-
pose, traveling for his health. Oh, sir, while
the memory of Libby and of Andersonville
lingers in the loyal heart there will be grief,
if not anguish, that this chief of criminals
escapes conviction. Voices not audible to
our ears will plead for his punishment; and
mercy, which is the highest type pf justice, will j
not be dumb at their pleadings. I care not
what others may say, but to vny mind it is
time some one, at least, expiated his crime of
treason by hanging between the heavens and
the earth, as unfit for either, a spectacle to
mankind and a lesson to the nation 1
But, Mr. President, justice sleeps for the
moment; it lies napping in the lap of time. It
will be summoned ere long, and, if not in our
way, in some way the crime3 of the past shall
be atoned for, and all things will be made
even. Sufficient for the moment it may be
that the leaders of this " lost cause" have lost
their leadership ; having been false as well as
wicked guides they are no more to be trusted
or followed. Other men will be raised up,
other hands will point the way, and other
voices will be heeded. All this time the work
will go on. The laborers may fall, but the edi-
fice will rise. Those who have been dumb for
generations, because forbidden to speak, will
now have voices. Those left out ot the enu-
meration when men were counted will now all
be numbered. "Those that were not will put
to naught those that were." So that the dream
of the fathers, who sighed for a free represent-
ative Republic, shall be realized.
• In this work there is no room for discour-
agement. Nothing worth preserving is ever
lost. Baffled for the moment, we return with
renewed energy and purpose, and " the work
goes bravely on." The voice of executive
opposition only insures success. A bill vetoed
is surer to become a law, and each statute is
an advance in the work. Encouraging voices
are speaking to us from every southern State.
No man is trampling upon the rights of the
freedman, for he has a ballot and sits upon
boards of registration and in constitutional
conventions. The "war of races" has passed,
for every voter is a "fellow-citizen." He is
now appealed to by the leaders in the South
with kind And loving words, just before elec-
tion at any rate. His odor has gone! his
manhood is recognized; the ballot is omnipo-
tent. It is better for protection than a stand-
ing army. It is invincible.
"It executes a freeman's will
As lightning does the will of God."
Mr. BUCKALEW. Mr. President, One
aspect of the general subject of reconstruction
has not been made prominent in this debate
so^ar as it has progressed. I think we should
take up this great subject and discuss it with
reference to the question of party power which
is involved in it, and which, whatever may ap-
pear upon the surface, really inspires those
who speak on both sides. We shall get a v t-y
inadequate idea of the subject of reconstruction
if we confine ourselves to a discussion of the
matter of the acts of Congress which were
passed in relation to it during the past year.
We shall get a very inadequate idea of it if we
discuss it with reference to the capacity of the
aduh colored men -of the South for the exer-
cise of the right of suffrage. We shall fail to
grasp and to comprehend it as it must be
grasped and comprehended by the highest in-
telligence if we confine ourselves to those con-
siderations which relate to it as a mere plan
for the political reorganization of the South.
Because this is so, as I believe, I shall begin
my remarks by describing the existing organ-
izations of power in the Government of the
United States, or rather in the legislative de-
partment or branch of that Government. Mr.
President, by referring to statistics, which are
now within reach, we shall ascertain that re-
cently there were at the popular elections held
in the northern, central, and western States
votes given which, when aggregated together,
amounted to a little more than two million one
hundred thousand in favor of what is known
as the Republican party ; and votes were also
given in favor of what is known as the Demo-
cratic party, or Conservative party, amounting
to a little over two million. The difference
between the sums total of votes given to each
party was about one hundred and fifteen thou-
sand:

This statement is arrived at by taking all the
I interesting and full elections which were held
in those States in 1867, and where bo such
elections were held in that year, borrowing the
figures from the previous year—1866—which
will give a very favorable tispect to the returns
for the Republican party, because it was much
stronger before the people in 1866 than it was
in 1867. • In the States of Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Iowa, and Missouri, lying together
in the West, contiguous to each other, there
were Republican majorities given at the elec-
tions in 1866 amounting to the large'aggregate
of one hundred and fifty-two thousand six hun-
dred and seventy-nine. If elections had been
held in those States in 1867, elections which
would have called out the full vote, would hare
induced a complete expression of the voice of
the people npon public affairs, no one ean
doubt that the greater portion of this aggre-
gate of one hundred and fifty-two thousand of
political majorities would have been swept
away. Instead of their amounting to that
large number they would most likely have not
been overtwenty or thirty thousand altogether;
and if you took the same proportion ©f loss
that occurred ia the State of Ohio in 1867 at
compared with the previous year this aggre-
gate 'majority would have been either wiped
out altogether or reduced to an insignificant
amount.
But, sir, I have not made any correction of
the numbers as they appear upon the face of
the returns. I have taken the elections for
1867, as far as those elections were full, and
the elections for the previousyear, where later
information could not be obtained. This state-
ment commences with Maine and goes through
all the States represented in Congress at this
moment, including even the dominion of Brown-
low. Tennessee is included, and every other
State represented in the Senate. The aggre-
gates made tip in the manner I have described
are of Democratic and Conservative votes
2,019,169, and of Republican votes 2,184,554,
giving an apparent Republican majority in th«
represented sections of the United States of
116,385. That is the result of the figures, and
upon a total vote amounting to 4,153,728.
Here you have in these election returns the
voice of the people of the United States as pro-
nounced attne latest periods at which we can
have a due and clear and satisfactory investiga-
tion, and I have made up this statement not in
a partial or unfair manner, but in one which is
liberal and favorable to the Republican party.
Then hpw oughtthe people of the United States,
whom we represent here, to be heard here ?
