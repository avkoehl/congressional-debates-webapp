HANCOCK, August 5, 1864.

(Received 10.30 a. m.)

General B. F. KELLEY:

The report of the rebel cavalry being on the Bath road is incorrect; it was General Averell's men. They have just come in from a scouting expedition, and say no rebs on the Batch road.

Major-General HUNTER:

SIR: I sent to you the following telegram from General Kelley:

CUMBERLAND, August 5, 1864.

We again defeated the enemy at New Creek yesterday. Their loss severe; ours not heavy.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

No enemy crossed the Potomac yesterday, as reported. He has withdrawn his picket from the other side of the river.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. DUFFIE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Nothing new from General Averell.

CUMBERLAND, August 5, 1864-9.10 a. m.

Brigadier-General DUFFIE:

Your telegram just received. Scouts report that General Averell overtook the enemy Moorefield and captured his artillery and 500 prisoners. This is not official; yet, I hope it is so. Your train, &c., arrived here yesterday morning. All quiet here. Will run trains to Hancock to-morrow if all right below you.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
