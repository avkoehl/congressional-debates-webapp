from your order. I wish to facilitate your operations every way. Command me in any way, and I am at your disposal. Telegraphic communication with the general via the United States Ford is broken. Will advise you when restored. I am of no service here while the line is down. If I can aid you on the field, command me.

BUTTERFIELD.

P. S.-My orders were to remain here from General Hooker, but I feel like disobedience now. Please consider this confidential.

MAY 3, 1863-11.27 o'clock.

General HOOKER:

Signal station reports (11.20 o'clock) enemy retreating in great disorders. They abandoned their line from Hazel Run to their extreme left. They are trying to form on the Dahlman Heights; their attempt as yet fruitless.

BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 3, 1863-11.40 o'clock.

General HOOKER:

Signal reports (11.15 a.m.) our troops gained crest of hill on Telegraph road; enemy retreating south on said road, with ambulances and wagons; some of their troops moving in direction of Orange Plank road. Sedgwick reports driving them on double-quick.

BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

UNITED STATES FORD, May 3, 1863-12 m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

General Hooker is doing well. We have plenty of fresh troops still left, but have gained no ground to-day, yet our lines are strong; but no doubt another desperate effort will be made to force our position. We feel confident that Sedgwick must press them fast. Answer me here. I will take it to General Hooker. He wants Sedgwick to press them.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 3, 1863-1863-12 m.

General SEDGWICK:

What answer can I send General Hooker?

BUTTERFIELD.

MAY 3, 1863-12 m.

R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster:

Sedgwick is by this time (12 m.) probably free from all obstructions of earthworks. He has carried the heights on right of Telegraph road.
