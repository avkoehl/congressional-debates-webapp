Lieutenant-Colonel Davis has had an interview with General Thompson. He took forty-eight hours to get his brigade commanders together to decide. Thompson's army is scattered all over North Arkansas, and Jeff. says he cannot surrender without consulting his brigade commanders. No news from plains. Dispatch just received from Lexington. One Clement demands surrender of that place; six miles out, and gives until to-morrow morning. Says he has the force, and will burn town, kill soldiers, &amp;c.
