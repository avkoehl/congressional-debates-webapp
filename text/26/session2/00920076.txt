fray's si ee"h on ihr uec «¡ity ol the i i hard of
New  York employ,! g an agent at   \ /do tiny on,
been led at once to conclude that it must hav e been
a burlesque of the speech actually delivered, for he
could not believe that any one, who wished, as
Mr Jaffray did, to prevent the passage of a law
m Congress, could ever be so blind to his own
interests as to moke such a speech as taat given
as his m the New York Herald.
But further Mr Jaffray had himself published,
in that very paper, a letter or card, positively de-
nying the correctness of the report, and represent-
ing it as a caneatme of his remarks, whieh card
had-been published m the Herald, without editorial
comment or remark, to his knowledge. Hence
Mr M concluded, oi course, as any man would
naturally conclude, that ihe report was admitted by
the editor to have been, as it was charged to be, a
mere playful burlesque. Mr M said he was not
theie to def nd Mr Jaffray, nor was he the'e to as
sail any man When the report oí Mr Jaffraj '*
let er had been read, he perceived th?t it had mere
effect in the Hou e than he could nave thought it
at all likely to have, snd apprehending that the
charac er oí the preat body of the meichan's, of
New York m ght possibly be injuriously affected by
the impression itpioduced, and from the comments
of the gentleman tiom Ma-sachu e'ls [Mr AdímsJ
on the proceedings i Í the meeting at which it had
been delivered, Mr M as in duty bound, had risen
in their defence, and had endeavored to show that
they were in no wi e justly i npb&ited. A" to this
Mi. Atite, Mr M had no doubt he was ene ot
the bcit teporte s in Ihis countiy He had 'aid no-
thing agan st his capacity or character, but he had
hriirstly supposed the repjrt ws a builesqut He
u peated thai he had r>o risen to defend Mr Jaffny
oi to ¡tl aeii the editor er ltpjrtti cf (h Heiald,
but meiely to perform a duty to hi constituent , by
preventing mi apprehen ion on this floor As an
evidence ot the total contempt in which this wh< le
matUr was regarded in New York, in all the letters
he had received from th t city, not a word ¿vs said
in any one ot Ihem about it In fact, it was too
ridicule us an affiir for Mr M to have any thing
fur her to do with, and he washed his hands of it
Mr ADAMS said that, if the gentleman fiom
New Yárk [Mr Monroe] had alluded to him as
nlendino-, in any remanís he I ad sjbmitled, to in-
jure the ornrar'cr ot the me-chants of New York—

Mr WADDY THOMPSON moved that so
much of the President's message as relates to mili-
tary affairs be referred to the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs
Mr ADAMS objected He said that the prac-
tice for some years had been for the House to go
into Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, and for some friend ef the President then
to portion out tne President's reessage among the
appropriate ommittee", by which means the whole
oí that document came under the consideration of
the House It was a good practice, and presented
the only mode by which the House could get full
po¿«ession of every part of the message. But,
withm the last few years, examples had crept in
which he hopfd, for all future times, would stand
as warnirg, and not as admon.tions, of not con-
sidering the message m Commit ee of the Whole,
but of individual gentlemen picking out particular
subjects in it, and having them referrecl to their
own comrnitiees This practice was not only
irregular, but highly inexpedient and injurious,
producing u ter c mtusion in the legislation of the
House It pieiented the House irom getting the
whole message under it  discussion, and that
which it did discuss wa. discussed under expo-
suie, every moment, to the previous question,
by which tree discuss on and full and ripe consi-
der<itic! was pievented Here a gentleman wanted
one particular portion of the message retened to
the Committee on Military Affairs but as Mr. A.
considered the portions of the message on lhat sub-
ject as highly important, he desired the whole mes-
^< „e should first be considered in Committee of ths
Wht le on the slate oi the Union , and he felt the
iothi-r anxiouo on this point because the gentleman
i' he head of the milit try committee at the last
sessonhal p'oii td to add sorn* 1,500 or 1,600
men to the standing ?rmy of the United States If the
House did go into Committee of the Whole, Mr.
A should very probably deliver sentiments on sev-
eral of the subjec's it contained very different from
those expresoed by the Pre&ident. He hoped the
'i gentleman would change his motion.
Mr THOMPSON consented, in pursuance of
th s su;ge-.t on, to change his motion for one to go
into Committee of the Whole on the President's
mes age, at d make it the special ordei on Monday
next He denied, expressly, that the bill to which
the honorable gentleman hdi alluded as introduced
last session did piopos? to augment, by a single
olicer oi man, th  standing army of the United
States, but its object vn s !0 pro'ect a frontier ex-
posed to the utmest dangers irom savage depreda-
t of and m? sicre
The motion, leqmring twe- hirds, was not agreed
to
Vvh reupon Mr THOMPSON gave notice that
he slu de" rmevv his motion on Monday next.
