thicket and among weeds on the banks of the Rio Grande one mile and a half above White's Ranch, where we remained undiscovered until 8. 30 a. m., when persons on the Mexican shore seeing us started to give the alarm to the rebels. At the same time soldiers of the Imperial Mexican Army were marching up that bank of the river. I immediately started for Palmetto Ranch, skirmishing most of the way with the enemy's cavalry, and drove them, at noon, from their camp, which had been occupied by about 190 men and horses, capturing 3 prisoners, 2 horses, and 4 beef-cattle, and their ten days' rations, just issued. Halted on the hill at Palmetto Ranch to rest and feed men and animals. While there at 3 p. m. a considerable force of the enemy appeared, and the position being indefensible, I fell back to White's Ranch for the night, skirmishing some on the way, and had one man of Second Texas Cavalry wounded. At the latter place sent a message to Colonel T. H. Barrett, commanding post Brazos Santiago, who joined me at daybreak of the 13th with 200 men of the Thirty-fourth Indiana Volunteer Infantry. I at once started forward by Colonel Barrett's order, and skirmishing soon commenced; continued all the morning. A halt was made at Palmetto Ranch and the remaining supplies of the enemy that had escaped the flames the day before were now burned. Moving two miles forward a sharp fight took place in the thicket on the river bank; one man severely wounded therein.

Afterward, by Colonel Barrett's order, fell back one mile and a half to a bluff on the river, about twelve miles from Boca Chica, to get dinner and rest for the night. Here at 4 p. m. a large force of the enemy's cavalry was observed endeavoring to gain our rear. I was ordered with the regiment to form line obliquely to the rear, faced toward them. As soon as formed, and while awaiting expected cavalry charge, the enemy from a hill up the river (one mile and a half farther on) opened with artillery, doing no damage and creating no panic in my command, when I moved off, as ordered by Colonel Barrett, in retreat, furnishing 140 men for skirmishers, under Captains Miller and Coffin and Lieutenants Foster and Mead. They kept the enemy at a respectful distance at all times and did their duty in the best possible manner. Some temporary confusion was created by a portion of the Thirty-fourth Indiana breaking through my regiment at double-quick while I was marching in quick time, but order was immediately restored. The retreat was conducted by the right flank, for the reason that the nearest body of the enemy, 250 strong, with two pieces of artillery, were evidently trying to gain our rear and a favorable opportunity to charge, which was each time prevented by halting my command and coming to a front, thus facing him with the river at our backs. The force engaged with our skirmishers up the river was not immediately feared by the battalion, being so much farther distant and their fire, both of artillery and cavalry, very inaccurate. Owing to this same flanking force of the enemy our skirmish line could not be relieved without exposing the men and our colors to capture while rallying. Our losses of ordnance, seven Enfield rifles and accouterments of camp and garrison equipage light. Casualties, two men missing, supposed to be in the hands of the enemy. * The men did their duty nobly. Lieutenant Kantrener, my acting adjutant, was especially gallant, assisting in every part of the field. Captain Dubois and Lieutenants Stewart and Franzman stuck to their places and kept their men in order under very trying circumstances. First Sergeants Shipley, Company E, and Brown, Company D, proved themselves, as far as field duty is neces-
