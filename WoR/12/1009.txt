The heat was excessive, but the troops all bore it, together with the entire absence of baggage, very scant food, and night marching, with praiseworthy indifference and alacrity. I will observe that this is the second pressing occasion in which Brigadier-General Emory has been taken away from his brigade. My command all marched back this morning, the cavalry to Gaines Mill, where I had ordered the baggage train to meet me, but found it had been ordered back to this old camp by General Porter; and from here I am instructed to move toward Old Church. Whenever a thousand or two of cavalry under a bold leader has it in its power to get in rear of the army, to make a dash on its communica- tions and depots, if it follow on the heels of the pickets into a camp of equal force, whether of light cavalry or cavalry reserve, it may chance to destroy it; and in this connection I would suggest a necessary pre- caution of safety on the flanks or rear of the army; that the inhabitants should be confined or restricted to their homesteads. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, P. ST. GEG. COOKE, Bri~yadier-General, U. S. Army. P. S.J am unable to forward a report of the scout ordered to Han- over Court-House, & c., on the 12th, in consequence of the absence of its commander, Captain Gregg, Sixth Cavalry, who I learn returned, and has been ordered somewhere. I have not yet received a report from Captain Royall, who is badly wounded. Respectfully, P. ST. GEO. COOKE, Brigadier-General. Brig. Gen. R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff. HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE, June 16, 18621.30 p. m. SIR: I have just received the reports of the officers connected with the attack on Captain Royall. My present duties make it impossible to connect them in a narrative report of mine at present, as your com- inunication requires, so I herewith inclose them. I only add that Cap- tain Royalls instructions were the original ones from the Headquarters of the Army. I will make the report of the march to Captain Royalls relief and the pursuit of the enemy as soon as I have time. Every moment of this day has been occupied by more pressing daties. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, P. ST. GEO. COOKE, Brigadier- General, U. S. Army. Capt. FRED. T. LOCKE Asst. Adjt. Gen., Fifth Provisional Army Corps. HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE, Camp near New Bridge, June 17, 1862.
