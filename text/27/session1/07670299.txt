Fiscal Bank—Mr, Mason.
H. of Reps.
upon the partieulai features m it to which I have
before referred, yet in no single instance can gen-
tlemen point me to any attack upon that other all-
important feature—the [separation of the Govern-
ment from the banks
This valuable principle, therefore was not a
question upon which the people acted at all at the
late election It was regarded, and very properly
too, a settled question And it shall be my purpose,
sir, briefly to endeavoi to show that it had been
fairly decided by the people previous to that time
Ido not wish any one to believe, hovvevei, that I
entertain the opinion, that, when a question has
been once settled, it can never a aa be touched
I entcr'ain no such belief But when once it has
been cleaily decided, it should so íemam, until
such decision hns been as clearly reversed. I
think I have shown that the people at the late elec
tion decided nothing with respect to the question
of the separation of the Gov eminent fi om the banks,
because such question was not submitted to them
The question, therefore, would be regarded as not
decided at all, unless it had been deciled befóte
that time , winch I assert to be Hue This propo-
sition it shall be my purpose to endeavor to prove
The sub treasury systen was fiiQt propo ed by
Mr. Van Bucen in September, 1837 As might
well have been supposed—and pioperly, too—at
first it created considerable apprehension and
alarm among the people It w as a proposition for
the introduction of an entirely new system into the
administration of the Government. Old theories
were to give place to this new one Ever jealous
of their rights and their liberties, the people ra eiv -
ed it with doubt and distrust Politicians took
advantage of those honest fears and doubts, to turn
them to the injur" and overthrow of the feailess
patriot who risked his political existence m the
step which he had taken At every election w I ^h
followed, whether general or local, this leooramcn
dation of the sub treasury system by Mr Vin
Buren was used against him w ith. all the force w ith
which it could be applied Every hideous shape
into which it could be distorted, whether by pre-
judice or falsehood, it -was made to assume. It
was, inshoit, made the test question, by both par-
ties, at eveiy election which followed its first re-
commendation, until it was regarded a-> ha\ ng re-
ceived the sanction of the people , and then, sir, it
■was abandoned (is all other test questions between
the democrat c and federal parties have been) by
the latter, bet ause the people have liivanablv de-
cided in favor of the foimei. Hence, vr, the
reason why this question w as not ag tated at the
last election. It had ceased to be a bugbear any
longer, and was therefore abandoned by pjliticians
for others which might prove more effectual—such
as the standing army, and otheis of asimilar ehai-
acter States entitled to 180 electoral votes de
cided, at their local elections, in fav or of the sub-
treasury system I do not. pretend to say that at
every election the democratic party were successful
in those States but at some one of them, where
the sub treasury was famy and distinctly made the
test, it received the unqualified sanction, of the
people
But, sir, a more conclusive ground ev en Ian1 he
one just referred to, I pi opose to take, to prov e the
correctness of my position The Congress v loch
had already been, elected at the time when this svs
tem was first proposed cojld not, by any possibility,
have expressed the voice of the people upon that
subject, because the subject nevei h<>d been befóte
agitated in th° country That Congiess was,
therefote, not elected with a view to that qnesfon
Upon their own disci etion, they rejected it three
several times Mr Van Buren still adhered to his
favorite measuie, íelymg upon the wisdom, pa-
triotism, virtue, and, mote 'han all, upon the love
of liberty in the people, foi then sUbseq lent coun-
tenance and support Another Con°ie=s w ns elect

States where the sub-tieasnrj quesion was rot
made th  tfsi and the only test uU"stioi Battle
af er batfl  had been fought upon this g,e t ques-
tion. Partial victories had been von upon both
sides. But it was left, sir, to the great poiiticl
Waterloo—the election foi the 26th Congress—10
decide fmallv the gieat question Biddle, the Na-
poleon of the money power of this countrv met
upon that field his fate , vv hich fate led, like Napo
lean's, to overthrow and to e<ule, if not upon the
island of St Helena, to the quiet and solitary
shades of Andalusia,
What did that Congress do i How did they re-
flect the voice of the people, from whom they were
fresh ^ In obedience to their mandates, they passed
into a law the independent or sub-treasury system
by a decided majority.
Now, sir, w e are giav ely told that this clear and
solemn decision of the people, made upon this dis-
tinct point, is to be regarded as reveised by the
elections oí last fall, which resulted in the eleva-
tion of the whig party to pow er, and which, if you
please, decided e/ety thing or nothing Absurd,
sir i I do not pretend to account for the result oí
those elections , but if I did the last reason which
tiuth would allow meto give w ould be opposition
to the suo-hcasuiy. It may have been the result of
a desire on the part of the people to manliest their
respect foi a patriot soldiei, v horn thej believed
was to be found in General Harmon It may have
been the result oi an enthusiasm which, m the his-
toiy of out countiy, was unparalleled, and which,
like the angi f torrent of the nuuntam, swept all
opposition before it, or it may hay e been the i suit
of the system of misiepresnitation and deception,
which was emjiloyed to defeat the then existing ad-
mimstiation "We all know and feel the result,
but it requires the wisdom of a gieatei jihilosopher
than th s countiy contains to point out the cause
In the overwhelming consequences ot those elec-
tions, the country has lost for a time 'he services of
one of the putest and ablest patnois that has ever
at any time presided over its dcstuues. A sacrifice
to blind enthusiasm, prejudice, and falsehood, is
Mr Van Buren The time is not fai dis ant how-

In addition to ti e lacts and proofs to which I
have airead} called the attention of'he committee,
I would rciei to at authority foi inv position, that
the naked and vital punnplp of the divorce of the
Treasury from the banks was not lermd'ated by
the people at the late presidential electioi Tl at
authority, sir, will be received with high consider-
ation, I feel assured, by tins House and the nation.
It is the authority of Geieral William Henry Hai-
nson, the late President of the United States In
his inaugural ac1 die's he u'esth s language in ref-
erence to the opinion of th" people upon this sub
ject "I know the ímpoitanc" wh di Ins been at
taehed by wen of great abilities -md pau.otism to
the divorce, as it is called, of the Tieasuiv from
the banking institutions It is not the divorce
which is complained of, but the unhallowed un on
of the Treasury with the Executive Department,
which has created such extensive alarm ' Gen-
eral Hainsou, then, acknowledges that \u" punri
pie of divorce was rot condemned by trie people,
but adds, that the union, of the T/cusviy i ith th
Ezccultie uas
I admit, then, t1 at this objection to the system is
a v alid one, in order that I may av i¿l mv aelf oí die
foice of this authority in suppoii of i ij -portion
And, to meet this objection, and the othei objection
to the system, vjz " that ih begets two kinds of
cmrencies—he ote for the people, and the othci
for tne ofiice-holdeis, —I should pi opose and ad-
v ocate, if there was any possibility of success, some
thing like the following modification to the law as
it now stands, m the si.aie of usUuetons to the
committee

Now, s^r, mtioduee such piov i ons v to the pi c
sent system, and it vy oukl then L  disarmed of ev ei v
objection which has been urged against it
The present Congress d xtinguished members of
which have spoken so grav ely about the wjl of
the people which they are called here to execute,
owes its existence to that same unknown cause
which elevated General Harrison to the Presiden-
cy It is a Congress that knows not to what source
it owes its being And I caution gentlemen how
they claim for this Congress a descent from any
hostility on the part of the people to a sepoi ahon of the
Goveiliment pom Vie banks. Many members of the
present Congress were elected during the time and
in the height of the popular excitement which re-
sulted in General Harrison's election. Were the
people willing at that time to prejudice the prospects
of a man whom they had determined to elevate, by
electing those who w ere opposed to him 1 Certain-
ly not, jp their 7eal to accomplish their purpose,
but one test was requited to entitle a man to their
support, and that was—a preference for General
Hamson over Mr Van Buren. All other ques-
tions, however more important they really may
have been, sunk into insignificance m comparison
with it
The gentleman from North Caiolina(Mr. Saun-
ders) showed clearly that though his State was re-
presented on this flooi by a majority of whigs, yet,
nevertheless, the people of his State were opposed
to a national bank I think I can show the same
m regard to my own State, as respects the repeal
ot the sub-treasury If my honorable colleagues
attribute their official existence to any such cause,
they w ill find themselves sadly mistaken. In my
humble opmion, upon the question of the propriety
of the repeal of the sub treasury, Maryland is mis-
repiesented on this floor. Audi shall proceed to
endeavor to prove it to every candid gentleman's
salisfactiou The first general election in Mary-
land aftei ihe recommendation of this system was
the gubernatorial election m 1838 The question
was then fanfy brought before the people, and
the íesult was upwards of three hundred majority
in favor of the democratic candidate, Governor
Grason The (demon turned chiefly on that ques-
tion I do not, however, rely so much upon that,
as I do upon the íesult of the succeeding election
for members of Congress in 1839. In every dis-
trict m the Stale, theie was regularly organized
opposition. The election turned exclusively upon
the Ticasury question Out of eight, the demo-
critic party elected five delegates to Congress, with
a popular majority in the State of upwards of fifteen
bundled votes And now my wothy whigfnends
upon this floor, who have got into Congress as
chief mournets in me funeral tram of the late
lamented Hamson, rathei than as the advocates of
any particular set of principles, are absolutely res-
tive imdei a desire to gel to vvoik tocairy into exe-
cutio), upon the head of the poor unoffending sub-
treasjry what they have been pleased to term the
judgment of the people Th«e remarks, however,
do not apply to all my whig colleigues My tnend
in fnnt of me (.Mr Jon\'soV)I believe correctly
represents his immediate constituents Like Eph-
rairi o<* old, he is "jo ned to his idols," and I am
oil" aliaid, sir, that at the October election the
p"op!c of the State w ill " let bun alone." I wish
rl'o to except my f.ieno> the repiesenta'ives from
the 'list and seventh districts Tor them, sir, "¡o
do evil, is to do their du'v "
But I have a word or two of caution to sav to
the lemaming three , and to my friend the member
f'om old Kent, I would say, Beware of your con
sti'uents' inJignation m your vote upon this meas-
