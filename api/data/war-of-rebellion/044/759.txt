On the 18th, we moved forward, and encamped near Bloomfield, Loudoun Country. June 19, we had a skirmish with the enemy near the pot-house. Moving forward at a rapid trot in support of Colonel Rosser, we came up with the enemy's sharpshooters. Our long-range guns (mounted by order) were sent to the front, and soon became engaged with the enemy, who were protected by a body of woods. There appearing to be a good deal of confusion, I ordered the Seventh to charge on the right flank, which was done with spirit. A stone fence was soon discovered in front, which had to be pulled down. We then charged through the gap, and uncovered the position of the enemy, which proved to be too strong to be attacked, three pieces of artillery occupying the crest above us, and with cavalry support and dismounted skirmishers behind a stone fence immediately in front of us. We moved on the flank and to the rear, but in quite good order, the enemy opening upon us with canister, but having only 2 horses wounded. Among the sharpshooters, Sergeant [Phineas] Stickley, Company H, was wounded in the hand, and Captain [J. C.] Shoup's horse wounded. The regiment then fell back with the brigade to Union. Remained near Union on the 20th. On the 21st, commenced skirmishing with the enemy near Union. Moved, as the day progressed, toward Ashby's Gap, and encountered ordered to support the battery. In obedience to General Jones' order, I charged upon the right flank of the enemy, who were posted behind a stone fence. The enemy charging on our flank, Company D was ordered by General Jones to charge them, which was done. Being exposed to a flank fire for a considerable distance, and the enemy being strongly posted, we failed to dislodge him, but succeeded in preventing the advance of the enemy. By this charge, the squadron with me became separated from the rest of the brigade, and acted, by order from General Stuart, in support of General Robertson. We made a successful charge in concert with him, driving the enemy a considerable distance before us. In this fight our losses were as follows:* Total--5 killed, 3 men mortally wounded, 13 others wounded in various degrees, and 1 missing. Total horses killed, 21; wounded, 27. Adjutant McCarty's horse also wounded. In reviewing this fight, I desire to pay a passing tribute specially to two noble spirits among the fallen - Lieutenant Walter [W.] Buck, Company E, Seventh Virginia Cavalry, and Private J. Warren Brent, Company A, Seventh Virginia Cavalry. Few more gallant have vielded up their spirits on the gory field since the opening of the war. Lieutenant Buck was bright, intelligent, and full of zeal in the service of his country. He was temporarily detailed to attend to the wants of the regiment in the assistant quartermaster's and commissary of subsistence departments, but nothing could withhold him from the field. The manly qualities of Private Brent are well illustrated by his words of encouragement to his fellows at the battle of Beverly Ford - "Come on, boys; it is better to die a brave man than live a coward; " and his sacrifice of life in the forefront, extorting from his enemies the praise that he was the bravest rebel they had ever met.

June 22. - Followed the enemy to and beyond Middleburg, the only casualty being 1 horse wounded.
