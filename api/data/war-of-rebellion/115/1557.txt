Being impressed with the belief from the evidence that the charge of disloyalty was sustained I ordered Mr. Hodges back to jail to be kept in close confinement, and now respectfully forward the papers with brief from his counsel for the consideration of the commanding general and await his orders as to the disposition I shall make of the prisoner.

Very respectfully,

DAN'L W. ADAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Post.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT NO. 2, July 2, 1862.

Mr. Hodges may be released. He should be admonished, however, that it is an unbecoming, discreditable weakness in any one to give way to despondency at this time because the enemy have possession of a portion of our soil and have had successes against us in this quarter. It is a culpable weakness further when resulting in such conversation as he had unquestionably with Mr. Humphreys. Such language may do as much hurt with the ignorant, weak and hesitating as downright disloyalty. In times like these Mr. Hodges does not play the part of a good citizen but actually of an incendiary when he sets to works to discredit the capacity, conduct and policy of the public authorities, the military especially, and it will not be permitted.

Respectfully,

[B. BRAGG.]
