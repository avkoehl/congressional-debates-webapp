General Johnson has orders to move at early dawn this morning on the road from here to Crawfish Spring and close up on General Thomas, who is now 4 mile in advance.

He directs that you have the officer in charge of your train report in person here to Colonel Boyd, who will take and the position it will occupy.. When on the road you will receive proper directions where to encamp. General McCook directs that if you have any information from your front you do not fail to communicate it.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,&amp;c.,

[Brig. General G. D. WAGNER:]

There is every indication of an early attack on our left flank. The enemy is massing his troops on his right. General Rosecrans is closing up this way. You should send your cavalry well out to the northeast, east, and southeast, and keep me advised of every movement. It is probable that the first shock will fall on your command and mine. Keep your troops well in hand. I have this moment returned from General Rosecrans' headquarters.
