HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 25, 1862.

Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,Secretary of War:

In view of the winter campaign at the South, I recommend Brigadier General W. H. C. Whiting be ordered to Charleston or Mobile. His knowledge and experience make his services there more valuable than here. He will probably be more needed at Mobile. Shall I order him?

R. E. LEE,

General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Submit this telegram to the President.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

Let General Lee order General Whiting to report here,and it may then be decided whether he will be sent to the South or not.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, October 25, 1862.

Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War:

SIR: The completion of the Danville and Greensborough Railroad as speedily as possible is almost absolutely essential to us in the operations of the ensuing campaign. The enemy will, doubtless, make his attack in the present winter south of the James River, and will make strenuous efforts to cut off our communication with the South by obtaining possession of the Petersburg, Weldon and Wilmington Railway. Should they succeed in this, hopeless disaster might ensue, unless we could rely on the interior connection, via Greensborough and Danville. This road should be pushed on to completion at once by every means in our power. I believe that I cannot urge its importance too strongly on the Government, and I therefore beg leave to call your attention to it.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.

Send copy to L. E. Harvie, esq., president of the Piedmont Railroad, and inform him that the Department is desirous of giving him every possible assistance, and will be glad to receive suggestion as so the mode in which it may be done.

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: Recommendations for promotion are so frequently made that the Department is perplexed in deciding upon them, and finds it difficult to exercise proper discrimination. I must request, therefore, that you will recommend such persons for promotion as you consider
