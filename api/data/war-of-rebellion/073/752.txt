ing nearly all the way, driving them back. The advance developed the fact that the enemy were in heavy force in front of Cassville. One division of them (Stevenson's) advanced on me in line of battle. I was compelled to withdraw. In the afternoon General Stoneman ordered me to advance with my division and attack. There was nothing but infantry in my front. I drove them from two lines of rifle-pits. The Second Indiana in a saber charge captured on entire company of Eighteenth Alabama. Part of the Eighth Iowa in a charge also killed and captured a number of the enemy. My artillery knocked one of the enemy's guns and one of their caissons all to pieces, which they left on the field. The prisoners inform me that I was fighting Stevenson's division in the morning and Stewart's in the afternoon. All the prisoners taken are infantry. We captured two of their ammunition wagons and a quantity of flour, corn, and bacon. Both men and horses of my division need rest. They have been in the saddle from eighteen to twenty hours each day since the 2nd of this month.

Our loss in killed and wounded was 34 or 35.

I am in the best position I could find here, covering all the roads that lead to the left and rear. I have sent 250 men across the ridge to cover the Cartersville road. I made no report heretofore, because one of your staff officers was here who would communicate to you any information of importance. Stevenson's division passed on the road from Acworth to Dallas this afternoon. Since my arrival here the enemy has thrown heavy cavalry pickets in front of me on all the roads. If I hear the sound of battle in the morning, unless otherwise ordered, I will swing around and endeavor to gain possession of this road over which their troops passed to-day, and on which Hood's corps marched yesterday. It is three miles form my present position. The train with Stevenson was his ammunition train. The information came too late to make any attack.

I have just taken 13 prisoners from the rear of the enemy's rear guard on Marietta road. A small detachment from my command are pushing and annoying them. I did not feel at liberty to detach any large force, as I was ordered to cover these roads, and moving in that direction would uncover them. These prisoners represent
