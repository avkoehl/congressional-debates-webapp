Espy, in a hand-to-hand combat, overpowered two rebels who refused to surrender to him. A great many others performed deeds of a similar character, but to mention all would occupy too much space.

The regiment in the assault had 1 commissioned officer killed and 2 wounded, 3 enlisted men killed and 22 wounded; total, 28.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS 110TH OHIO VOLUNTEERS,April 15, 1865.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with orders, I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of the One hundred and tenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry from April 3, 1865:

After the assault upon the enemy's works in front of Petersburg, Va., April 2, 1865, in which the One hundred and tenth Regiment took a prominent part, and of which I made mention in a former report, the regiment joined in the pursuit of the enemy, but did not become engaged with him until the 6th, when, near Little Sailor's Creek, we met the enemy in force. Lines were immediately formed, the One hundred and tenth Regiment constituting the right of the first line, Companies A and F being deployed as skirmishers to the right. We advanced through a narrow strip of woods, where we were met by a severe fire of shell and grape, with musketry, which caused a temporary halt; but we again advanced, still exposed to the fire of grape and canister, driving the enemy before us across a large, open field, compelling the enemy's artillery to leave its position, and capturing a number of wagons, with some ammunition. Had the men been fresh, instead of being fatigued from the day's march, I have no doubt we could have taken the enemy's battery.

In this charge the regiment was more fortunate than usual, having only one man wounded.

The regiment was, with its brigade, in pursuit of the rebel army at the time it was surrendered by the rebel general, Robert E. Lee.

The regiment then marched, with balance of the troops, to its present position.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. H. BINKLEY,

Brevet Colonel 110th Ohio Volunteers, Commanding Regiment.
