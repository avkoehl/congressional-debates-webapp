W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

BALTIMORE, January 8, 1865-2 p.m.

General GRANT:

I know nothing of the movement of the troops from General Sheridan, except what the depot quartermaster informed me on Friday night-that a division had arrived but there were no transports ready whereupon I provided camp ground. The quartermaster now informs me that transportation for 3,000 is here. Remainder of vessels expected hourly from New York, having left on 5th and 7th. Transportation sent from Old Point was not sufficient. General Grover, who is in command, informs me he will embark the troops and depart as each vessel is ready, without waiting for all and with all possible haste. I will render him all the aid I can.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General

Your dispatch received. I am advised by Colonel Wise that in addition to the vessels now here a sufficient number left New York on the 5th and 6th instant to complete the transportation required. These, however, have not yet arrived. Every effort will be made to hasten the embarkation of the troops.
