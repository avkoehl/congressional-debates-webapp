A package of other papers belonging to the firm of Maury Bros. was brought to me but upon examination I do not find anything in them to justify their being withheld and shall restore them.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.

I sent forward the envelope with the letters referred to above but omitted to place this* in it. If I have put in another in mistake please return the same.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 21, 1861.

Honorable MONTGOMERY BLAIR, Postmaster-General, Washington.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 19th instant inclosing a letter from William L. Burt, esq., of Boston, relative to correspondence intended for the insurgents addressed to their agents in Europe under cover to Mr. Wainwright, of Boston. In reply I have to suggest that since Mr. Wainwright appears to be a loyal citizen the postmaster at Boston be directed to deliver the letters to him, but at the same time to inform him that inasmuch as letters relative to plans for breaking the blockade and furnishing information to the insurgents have passed through his hands it is expected that hereafter he (Wainwright) will not send such letters forward but that when he comes in possession of any trasonable correspondence he will deliver it to the U. S. marshal for the district of Massachusetts to be forwarded to this Department.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 21, 1861.

ROBERT MURRAY, Esq., U. S. Marshal, New York.

SIR: It has been intimated to this Department that M. F. and Rutson Maury, confined at Fort Lafayette, are perhaps suffering from the want of proper clothing by reason of the detention of their trunks by the U. S. officers of the northern district of Ohio who have filed a libel for the confiscation of the same with their contents. You will please ascertain the facts and take [such] measures as may be necessary to provide the Maurys with needful clothing.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 21, 1861.

M. H. GRINNELL, Esq., New York.

SIR: Your letter of the 20th instant+ with its inclosure has been received. In reply I have to state that the U. S. officers of the northern district of Ohio have filed a libel for the confiscation of the trunks and their contents belonging to M. F. and Rutson Maury. Robert Murray,
