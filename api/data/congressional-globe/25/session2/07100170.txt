25th Con'G""2m> Sess._______________Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Brown.______________________________Senate.
President of the United States, of having made an
unnecessary and unprovoked war on the late Bank
of the United States, and that, by having occasion-
ed its destruction, he had brought on the country
the late pecuniary and commercial embarrass-
ments, wlnck it has suffered Mr B. joined is ue,
as to both allegations, and denied that they \v ere
true in point of fact. In the first annual message
of President Jackson, he called the attention of
Congress and of the nation, to the question of the
renewal of lit. charter, and expiessed doubts, both
as to its constitutionality and expediency This,
he had done, not only in the exercise of his unques-
tionable right, as Chief Magistrate, but in obedi-
ence to a high constitutional duly, requiring that
high officer to lay before Congres--, from time to
time, information on the condition of public af-
fairs. The Bank of the United Stales had no claim,
either founded on justice or on ¿ny other conside-
ration, to a i ene wal of its chartei. It was purely
a question for the decision -oíthe Legislative and the
Exaeutive branches of the Government, and any
attempt by that corporation, to call that de-
cision into question, was insolent and dicta-
torial, and was, m itself, a war on that
branch of the Government, whose course of aciion
it thus arraigned. The opinions ot the late Pre-
sident, on that subject, were noi the icsull of change
or caprice, but they «ere m entire accordance
with 1ns published opinions, in i elation to the con-
stitutionality of a National Bank, which he had
enteitamed fiom a veiy earlv petiod ot his public
lite He was a member oi Congress shortly aftei
ihe Government went into opeiation, and acted
umlormily with the Republican party of that day,
a part of whose creed was, that the Government
of the United States had no right to cieate a bank
This opposition, then, to the renewal ol the charter
of the late bank, which is now, by some, sought to
be imputed to peisonal hostility to that institution,
was but the result of old and long cherished political
ptmaples. For having ventured to express them,
he was assailed by that institution with the bitteicst
missiles of the piess, and lis funds anil money
abundantly lavished, (a part of which belonged
to the Government,) to cany on the wai In the
spring of 1832, it applied to Congress for a ret hal-
ter, selecting the year to do so in «huh the
Presidential election came on, and thus, in
effect, held over the head of die Executive branch
of the Government it- mighty influence and sup-
posed popularity with the nation, to intimidate him
m his course, and extort from him an assent to the
bill proposing to renew its chartei With charac-
teristic firmness, he resisted this bold assault on his
independence as Chief Magistrate, and negatived
the bill. In this memorable act, he was home out
most triumphantly by the public voice This was
the extent of his offending, and, for resisting this
bold defiance, was his conduct no  so much ar-
raigned. As well might the discomfmed and de-
feated legions who attacked his army at JNew
Orleans, have charged him atterwards with having
made an offensive mai on them In one case, ho
had stood on the soil of his country, to defend it
from invasion. In the other, he stoo 1 on thepim-
ciples of the Constitution, to guaid it from encioach-
ment.
The scenes -which he had witnessed here, at the
session of 183 i, after the removal of the deposites -
the violent attempt, made by the partisans ot the
bank to produce excitement against the then Ad-
ministration, and all who supported it—the bold and
daring efforts made to overawe the Executive branch
of the Government, and the free deliberations of
Congress, had convinced him of the dan"erous and
monstrous power of great nwnej ed corporations
But for that invincible firmness possessed by the
late President of the United States and the high
degree of public confidenee which he enjoyed, his
Administration would undoubtedly have fallen un-
der such a powerful antagonist. He bel eved that
no other man in this country, acting as President,
could have vuth'to >d the tempest, but that they
would have been whelmed beneath its fury
He, thereiore, placed but little faith in the opinions
of gentlemen, when they spoke of the weakness,
and harmless power, of moneyed corporations'
It was the weakness of the lion when sleeping, but
who, when waked into action, overpowers and de-
stroys his victim'
As to the second branch of the charge, which
imputed the pecuniary disasters of the country to
the policy which had been pursued m relation to the
late bank, the subject had been so fully and ably
examined, at the late called session, m the speeches
of many Senators, who supported the Administra-
tion, and the causes traced so duecily to the succes-
sive contractions and expansions, resoited to by ths
United States Bank, as was believed, for the pm-
poses of operating on public opinion, to effect its
lecharter, that it would be but a íepetiüon of the
arguments then used, to enter on it again. But that
these movements of the bank fust led to the com-
mencement of those gambling speculations, which
were, m their disastrous progtess, aftervvauls aided
by other causes, he could have no doubt
He thought the reproach endeavoied to be cast
on the friends of the Adnimistiation, came fiom
gentlemen vviln no vci> good gtace, when they
taunted them with having foiled to liumsh, what
they called, "ihe bettei currency " Had gentlemen
themselves done ail in their povvei to produce a
sound slite of the cuireney? Had they, m good
faith, traen then support to such measuies of the
Administration as weie of a chaiactcr to eflect that
object? On the contiary, had they not, by their
acts, as well as speeches, made war "on the bettei
current}," which was gold and silvcii Had it not
been consideied, by them, a sort of offence against
ths a edit system, that the Administration should
have encouraged the importation ol specie from
abroad, to place Ui more on an equality with other
nations, m that respect7 Yes, t very dollai of haul
montrj brought fiom Europe to Un* country, had
been considered, and healed, bj them, as a sort ol
unlawful íntiiuler, deseiving to be expi lied' Every
dollar of hard money was to be dnven liom encu-
lation, by the issue of that jxstilence to the cunen-
cy—every species of ¡small notes, down to the lowest
denomination «1 cent bills' When it was kn >wn
that the Opposition had lavoicd and suppoitcd this
course of jiolicy, so destructivo to the attainment of
"the bettei cunency," it did not become them to
thiow out leprojiches on that subject The great
moneyed power of the late Bank of the United
States, then jiolttical ally, had, he believed, been
witldid to defeat the purposes ol the friends of the
Administration, in relation t  the currency, by pro-
ducing all the confusion and deiangcmcnt which it
was ableto effect He k peated, thereiore, that these
repioaches would continue to < oiiio with a vciy ill
frrace, fiom that (¡natter, until gentlemen showed
that th y had done all in their p vv<r, in good faith,
to aid the policy of the Administration, by pursuing
a course of measures favor lble to tin supptession
of small notes, and a greater cuculation ol gold
and silvei cmreney
In riíiütton to the question of a National Bank,
now no longer kept in the back gtound, in the de-
bate by its fiicnds, as was formerly the case, there
was another objection to it, m addition to many
othcis, which had been repeatedly uiged in debate,
that had not keen adverted to, that was entitled to
great consideration, in his opinion Springing, as
such ar institution has heietofore, and, if hereafter
adopted, must ag^uii, from that broad and undefined
field of constitution, which makes the Constitution
mi an any thing that mgc niou men may choose to
make it, all Us sy npathics would necessarily incline
it to support all that class of measures, claiming
the same lineage It will, therefore, be the natural
ally of the tariff, of internal improvement, and all
other kindred measures, derived from construction
Conscious of the doubtful tenure by which it would
exist undei the Constitution, its interests and safety
would both lead it to create as many allies as it
could, of the same character, for -nutual support
and protection Here, then, would cxi ,t a great
moneyed power, whose interests would lead it to
urge the Government beyond its sphere of consti-
tutional action, and to build up other great inte-
rests ol doubtful powei, in order to guarantee its
own pumanency.
It had, said Mr B occurred to him, as a cir-
cumstance by no means unimportant, as related to
the question of a National Bank, and as on« highly
interesting to the Southern States particularly, that
hath ths prices of their great staples, ana those of
property generally, had, since the removal of the
deposites, and the going down of ihe Bank of the
United States., been higher, so far as he was able
to inform himself, than they had through any series
of the same number of years, during the existence
of the National Bank. Nor was this estimáis
made by the standard of bank notes, which were,
perhaps, generally, at this time, at some three or
four per cent, discount; but, allowing for the dif-
ference between notes and specie, would hold good.
It was certain that, during nearly the whole time of
the existence of the charter of the National Bank,
the whole planting interest of the Southern States
was, with the exception of a few prosperous years,
almost entirely prostiated. That the tariff had a
highly pernicious effect on those interests ke did
not doubt, nor did he doubt that the operations of
the National Bank had likewise greatly aggra-
vated the mjnry. He believed, at this time, that
the Southern States enjoyed more real, substantial
prosperity, as a whole, than they had done at any
time since the Revolution That there was some
scarcity of money, and, in places, some commer-
merwal distress, he admitted; but he believed the
gieat mass of the planters, were more really pros-
perous than at any foimer time.
The Senatoi Irom Kentucky, [Mr. Clay] and
the Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Rives] had, by a
very ingenious proceis of reasoning, endeavored to
construct, on what he viewed as a very harmless
and necessary clause m ihe bill, an immense Go-
vernment bank, which each endowed, according to
his iancy, with every dangerous power to do mis-
chief to the country. This charge against the bill,
he thought, was without the semblance of an argu-
ment to support it It was a discovery, for which
a patent right was deserved by those who had
made it. The section of the bill on which this ob-
jection is gtounded, was framed to answer two pur-
poses, and thost two alone. It simply authorized
the Secietaiy of the Treasury to transfer, by his
diaft, money fiom one public depository to another,
to prevent too great an accumulation at any one
point, and to have the public funds m readiness at
such places as they were wanted for thepMie expen-
ditures. It proposed, then, to give the Secretary
two powers, which were indispensable to the safety
of the public funds, and the fiscal action oí the Go-
vernment. The power to transfer the funds from
one depository to another, m case they accumu-
lated to too great.an amount, is only a measure of
precaution for their safety, and looks to that object
alone. The power to transfer from one point to
another, to meet public expenditures, is a power
absolutely necessary to the fiscal operations of the
Government, and without which it could not move.
It was a power that was not now, for the first time,
to be given, but existed, to the same extent, in the
deposite act of 1836, and which, he believed, was
voted for by most individuals, of both political
parties.
Mr. B would now proceed to say a few words
on the subject of the amendment proposed by the
Senator from Virginia, [Mr Rives,] and could not
abstain from the expression of his regret, that that
distinguished gentleman had deemed it his duty to
denounce, in such harsh terms, the original bill.
While he was, disposed to accord to every one
an entire right to pursue the dictates of his own
judgment, yet, in reference to the language of that
gentleman, he muot be allowed to say, that "a
friendly eye could never see such faults."    \
The amendment proposed, to which he hadjust
alluded, would, if carried into effeet, become a mea-
sure of vastly more Executive patronage than the
original bill would confer. Its leading feature was,
to give the Secretary of the Treasury power to se-
lect a number, not exceeding twenty-five, from
among the State banks, to act as public deposito-
ries, and they, under the supervision of'the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, to have the power to deter-
mine what notes, of the eight hundred banks
throughout the United States, shall be received in
payment of the public dues. If this was not, in
name, a great national bank, it unquestionably
po^seoseti all the essential machinery to make it
one. It had the ominous number of twenty-five in
it, corresponding, m that respect, to the number
