ROSSVILLE, SIGNAL STATION, September 18, 1863. (Received 11p.m.)

General GORDON GRANGER,

(Care of Major-General Rosecrans):

McCook has just reported his arrival at Reed's Bridge,but could

not find Minty. He captured 5 prisoners, who said they belonged to Johnston's brigade. They represent Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Firing has been heard by McCook in the direction of Whitaker. The citizens report that Minty moved off to the north,which is not believed. Mitchell's brigade was sent to re-enforce McCook, but General Steedman thinks that he should direct Mitchell to re-enforce Whitaker, but will await your orders, as Mitchell's brigade was sent on General Rosecrans' orders. A wagon train crossed Reed's Bridge just in advance of McCook's vanguard. Reed's Bridge and Peeler's Mills are certainly separate and district. Please give necessary instructions.

Very respectfully, you obedient servant,

WILLIAM C. RUSSELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. 1ST BRIGADE, 1ST DIVISION, RESERVE CORPS,September 18, 1863-8.30 p.m.

[Captain S. B. MOE,]

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

My command has advanced as far as the first creek out. The ford is a little difficult. Found the enemy at this ford at 5.45 o'clock. Drove him one-half mile. We are now resting part of the command on one side of the creek, part on the side next Chattanooga. He has more than one brigade and a battery that I know of. How far shall I feel him in the morning? Have had 1 killed and 4 wounded. We have killed several of them. No forces with me but my brigade. Do not know where McCook is.

W. C. WHITAKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General:
