(Received, War Department, July 13, 12. 15 a. m.)

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

With due respect to Messrs. Cameroon and Moorhead, * I must say that I do not think there is a city in the Union where Trimble would be as little likely to get a chance for intercourse with traitorous associates as in Baltimore. He has constantly been favored with opportunities at Gettysburg, which he could not have had here.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 12, 1863-12. 30 p. m.

(Received 5. 15 p. m.)

General WARREN,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

It is reported that the rebels crossed a good many horses yesterday at Williamsport, swimming the river, and that fourteen flats were nearly completed yesterday. I cannot find out that any large force of the enemy is at Fairview. My Second Division will move down so soon as my provisions are up.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
