ning to the river. The enemy attempted to dispute the crossing, and will no doubt give us a fight at or near Oxford. From all I can learn they are collecting all their scattered forces at that point. So be it; I will give them time, as we will have the advantage of being near our base.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 10, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE;

Johnson's force is full 1,000 strong. Sypert, Taylor, and Jessee, together, have about same force. Is there any considerable Federal force moving in that direction? If not and there is no prospect of it I shall make requisition upon Governor Morton for militia force to place upon the border. General Heintzelman has no troops to send me.

I understood General Hobson was to move after Johnson. Where is he now? I think Johnson should be attacked without delay. The FIFTY- second Kentucky are ordered to move against him from below.
