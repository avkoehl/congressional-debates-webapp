[D. V. ADAMS:]

GENERAL; I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that you will move at daylight with your command south of the railroad to Clinton; your trains in advance of your troops.

You will keep a strong rear guard, and look well to an advance of the enemy from the direction of the Big Black. Vicksburg has fallen, and the movement requires both celerity and vigilance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,[JOHN A. BUCKNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.]
