River, and crossing the heads of its small tributaries,exists, it would be advisable to follow it. Wagons to be used should be overhauled thoroughly, and horses and mules new and well shod. Nothing should be taken; baggage can be done without. If there is deficiency in supply trains, they can be furnished from this place. A movement on Little Rock will probably cause Marmaduke to fall back from Jacksonport, or Price may abandon that point, unite with Marmaduke,and strike rapidly for Missouri. It is the desire of the General-in-Chief that the country north of the Arkansas be cleared, and our south lines established on that river. I shall see General Schofield at Cairo in a very few days, before you can get ready, and will confer with you as soon thereafter as possible.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
