In the Field, Ga., July 1, 1864-10.15 p.m.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: General McPherson is ordered to send a division to support us in the morning, to start at 4 a.m. I have directed General Cox if you are attacked in the morning to support you with all his available force, relying upon General McPherson's troops to hold his present position and give what additional support may be necessary. Make your defenses strong and extend them far enough to deploy your whole division if necessary. You can then hold in check anything the enemy may send until re-enforcements can reach you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

You know his command is small, and though there is no force now that can disturb him, he thinks there may be in the morning. I want you to start one of your divisions down about 4 a.m. and to act in support of Schofield until your command gets there the next day.
