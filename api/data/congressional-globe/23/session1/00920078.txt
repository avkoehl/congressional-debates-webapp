THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 3,
were refused for near a week in New York, till the
cashier of the branch could first write, and then
fly m person, to the mother bank to get leave to
receive them, perhaps about $50,000, refused the
same way in Baltimore, until a like communica-
tion could be had with the mother bank, and
refused absolutely and without explanation at the
bank in Mobile, which was too distant to commu-
nicate with the mother bank. Mr B said that he
stated these facts from a mere sight of the letters
which proved them, the proof would be before the
Senate soon, and he should endeavor to fix public
attention upon a transaction which he might qual-
ify as diabolical and infernal. The result of the
whole was, that when all these circumstances
growing out of the state of the country had made
an unusual demand foi rroney—when the bank
had increased that demand by an extraordinary
accumulation of bills of exchange—the contrac-
tion was commenced at the i ate of several millions
a month, including the bills at ninety days, and at
the moment then own distant bank notes would
have become unavailable in the hands of the hold-
ers if it had not been for the energy of the Secre-
tary of the Tieasury, who coerced the payment of
the branch notes by those celebrated transter di afts
for about two millions and a quarter, the views of
which, and the fear of more to follow, compelled
the Bank of the United States to relax her policy,
pel nut hei branch notes to be received as usual,
and thus saved the country from the shock of an
unconvertible currency
Mr Efntton had, he said, already demonstrated
that ¡he present piessure in the money market
was not o ily unnecessary, but wanton He would
now proceed to piove that the curtailment, so
reprehensible in itself, was conducted in a manner
which was illegal and violated the charter of the
bank, and in the next place, he would prove that
the curtailment was unequal and partial in its
character and operation. He hoped that he fully
felt the responsibility which he undeuook in
malting chaiges against any individual or bodies
coiporate out of this House, and it was from the
thorough conviction that what he asserted could
be proved that he was induced to bring forward
these charges, and, moreover, it was his intention
to give the United States Bank a fair and full
opportunity to vindicate itself from the charges, if
they weie unfounded.
Fust, the mode of curtailment was illegal He
repeated the words of the chatter, stating that the
business of the bank could not be transacted by
less than seven directors, one of whom should be
the president These being the words, he held tnat
the curtailment of twelve millions in five months, i
/as a portion of that business which could be
legally transacted only by a board of dnectors
Now, sn, here is a paper that has come before us
as a public document, and may be taken as evi-
dence of the tru'hof what it contains till it is con-
tradicted Mi 13 then read, from the memorial
of the Government directois, a paragraph, and
said
This, sn , shows that the curtailment was not
made by the board of directors, noi even by a
committee appointed by the board, but by the
prtsident Yes, air, this enormous pressui e which
was to bear upon the whole community, was the
woik of one single individual It appeals that
the removal of the deposites being supposed to
be probable, the bank began to take steps to meet
it, as early as May or June, by curtailing its busi-
ness
The Government directors ga've us an account,
in a narrative of fcevral pages, of the steps taken
to get at tne reduction to be made lie read first
an oider of the board in May, directing a com-
mittee to report a plan of curtailment, and re-
marked, so far, so good That íesolution he held
to be a wise one—but thafwas. by the board, and
was legal He read the íesolu'ion of the 13th of
August, and the whole history of the curtailment
from the repoit of the Government directors
" Jlewhed, That for the present, and ur til the
'further order oi the board, the amount of bills
' discounted shall not be increased at the bank and
' the several offices Tnat the bills of exchange
' puichased at the bank, and all the offices, except
' the five western offices,shall not have more than
"JO days to íun That the five western offices be j
' instructed to purchase no bills of exchange, ex- I
oept those payable in the Atlantic cities, not hav-
ing more than ninety days to run, or those which
may be received in payment of existing debts to
the bank and the offices, and then not having
more than four months to run "                           i
"We perceived at once, in this measuie, the   i
commencement of a system of reduc ion, in con-   I
ducting which, wisely and impartially, the wel-
fare of the whole community was involved    No
: notice of these resolutions had been given, and
1 therefore, while we concurred, as we stated,In
' the propriety and expediency of reducing the   |
1 business of the institution, we required that the
1 plan should be carefully weighed, so as to bear
1 equally on all parts of the country, and on all   '
debtors to the bank     We desired, also, to have
1 the result of the views and inquiries of the com-
mittee aheady appointed     With these objects,
1 we asked that the resolutions might be postponed
1 for one week, or even until the next meeting, it   I
being understood that the subject should be then
1 definitely acted upon    Our request was refused    |
1 The resolutions were passed at once, and, as
usual, by the vote of all present except one other
director and ourselves    Believing that this meas-
ure was notonly precipitate, bu1 partial,and that
it would lead to curtailments  unequal and op
pressive,and entertaining the opinion that a sys
tem might easily be formed on a just basis, we
offered the following resolution
" Whereas a íesolution was adopted on the 7th
of May last, instructing the committee on the
state of the bank toiepoit to the board a scale of
reduction in the businessof themstitution, and no
report has been made in pursuance theieot, And
whereas a resolution passed at the last meeting,  !
which places certain restrictions on the business
of the institution, confines the same to five of the
western offices—
" ' Resolved, That the committee on the state of
the bank be instructed to report to the board, at
as early a day as possible, a system forthegrad-  i
ual i eduction of the business of the institution  i
throughout all sections of the country, having  '
regard to the mteiest of the stockholders, the
debtors of the bank, and the community in gen-
'eral '
" Phis plan, which would have prevented an
1 oppi ese>ive and partial system of cuitailmentjCon-
' fined to particular portionsof the country, and ex-
' erted at particular times, which would have given   l
'to the subject full and fair consideration, and   '
' which, above all, would have enabled every mem-
1 bei of the board to exercise his deliberate judg-
1 ment, was, as usual, i ejected     Nor was this all,
' when we offeied the resolution, temperately ex-  I
1 pressed as it is, the President himself asked the  I
1 question of cons deration upon it, though no mo-
1 tion to that effect had been made—a course never
'before adopted in the beard, nor sanctioned by
1 the by laws, and evidently introduced to curtail
: more effectually, if possible, the very limited in
' terference in the affaus of the institution which
was still allowed to the public djiectois   On this   I
suggestion of the president the msjouty refused
1 even to consider our resolution, by the vote of all
1 present except one director and ourselves   This
plan was peisisted in, and subsequently earned
1 still further  A series of i esolutions wei e adopted
' foi reducing the business of the institution, and
' authority was given to the committee on Ike offices,  I
' which is appointed by the president alone, to modify
1 them in such maniiei as they should deem expedient, .
' and eventually that committee was authorized to i
1 direct such measures for the general reduction of l|
1 the bus ness of the bank as they should think J
1 best   We offered, as an amendment to the reso- '
' lution giving to a committee this extraordmaiy
1 power, a request that ' they should lepod to the  i
' board such measures as they directed '    This le
'questions lejectedby the usual vote   Itis.of couise,
'impossible tor us to know by what principles of
' policy the committee have been governed     Its
' proceedings are secret, and we can on'y ascertain
'at intervals some of the results to which they
'lead     We attribute to thern the excessive cur-
' tailment m the business of themstitution, which I
'hasMately been so sudden and oppressive, and
which was not necessary either to the extent to |
' which it has been carried, or in the manner in
: which it has been made to bear on the commu- ]|
nity    With these sentiments, and in the hope 'I
' that the board itself might be induced, at a time
' like this, to interpose aid to exercise, for tne wel-
' fare of the community, some poition at least, of
' that unlimited power it had lnirusted to the com-
' mittee, we lately offered the following resolu-
' tions
" ' Whereas the pressure on the commercial
' community at this time may be i emoved by a lib-
' eral spirit of accommodation on the part of the
'banks generally, And whereas the State banks
' complain that m consequence of the balances be-
' ing largely in favor of the Bank of the United
' States, they are unable to afford the necessary fa-
' cililies to their cu&tomers without subjecting them-
' selves to increased demands fiorn this bank, And
' whereas it is believed that were the banks in this
' District to extend their loans twenty per cent be-
' yond the income, for a period of thirty days, it
' would relieve the money market, restore cjnfi-
' dence, and have a salutary effect on the industry
' and enterprise of our citizens    Therefore,
" ' Resolved, That a committee of three be ap-
' pointed, to confer with similar committees that
' may be appointed by the other banks, for the
' purpose of uniting in some arrangement to carry
' imo effect the object of the foiegomg preamble,
' and that the cashier be requested to send copies
' of the above to the presidents and directors of the
' other banks, with a request that their determina-
' tion on the subject may be communicated as early
' as piacticable '
" fhebe resolutions, the effect of which would
' have been to produce a concert of action among
' the banks foi the relief of the mercantile com-
' mumty at a period of difficulty, and to display,
' on the part of the Bank of the United States, a
' aetermination to afford it, which cou'd not have
'been unsuccessful, the boaid lefused even to
'consider, they wete rejected in the usual sum-
' mary manner, and the whole subject remains as
' before—m the power of the committee on the
' offices
" It will thus be seen that, while the unlimited
1 authonty of the president to expend the funds of
' the bank had been deliberately confirmed, and
' while the committee on exchange", selected and
1 appointed by him, had been officially permitted
' to discount notes and carry on the proper busi-
' ness of the board, now, in addition to all this,
' the measures of the institution in the regulation of
' its vast business, at this most important crisis,
' uere mti usted to the committee on the offices, also
' selected and appointed by the president, accompanied
' by ar  explifl i efmal toiequae them to t eport any rf
' then acts to the boaid "
Mi  B cortinued—
It was not to a breach of the by-laws that he
alluded as a breach of the charter
This high function of the boaid was delegated
to a committee This was equivalent to a delega-
tion by Congiess to one of its committees of that
legislative power which the Constitution vests in
the two Houses of Congress
Here an authority is given to a committee to
make an enoimous íeducíion, an authority, too,
unlimited by the terms of the resolution which
bestows it The whole power of the board is
surrendered to a subaltern board Sir, said Mr
Sentón, I denounce it as an atrocious violation
oí the charter of the bank Ele hoped the ques-
tion would be biought, for decision, before some
tnounal competent to try the ¡aw and the facts,
wnether this was a violation of the charter and a
forfeiture of it
Does the Senate hear me> exclaimed Mr B
Lest there was a single individual whose ears had
not caught the words, he would read them again
He reads and exclaims
The, five Govern ment directors appointed by the
President and Senate of the United States to rep-
resent seven millions of public stock, and to actaa
guardians over a greater amount of public depos-
ites, were leftm the dark as to the immense busi-
ness which might be transacted by a committee,
left to find out what was done, like mere strangers
to the board'
One of these resolutions was that the Bank of
the United States should act in concert with the
city banks in the adoption of measures for the re-
lief of the money market In what m inner was it
received by this lm lenous board ! They would
not even considu it'   They did not considei and
