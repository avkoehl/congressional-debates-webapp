that the proposition to grant pre-emption rights to
a State was new in. principle. Lands had been
granted heretofore to the Stales, but never pre-
emption to them.
Mi EWING denied there was any novelty m
the principle, unless the bill itself was a new one,
and who would deny a right to a whole sovereign
State, which was not refused to its citizens.
Mr. DUNN, m view ot the existence of the
combinations that would be formed at the sale,
did not believe the United States would acquire
more from the proceeds, than if the State of In-
diena got it at the minimum price. Moreover,
by granting it to the State, the Treasury would be
in the immediate receipt of the money.
Mr POPE suggested that the amendment should
be altered so as to compel the State, if shs entered
any part of the lands, to take the whole.
Mr. UNDERWOOD explained, and severely
condemned the whole plan It was giving a State
the privilege of speculating on the lands, over the
heads of the settlers, and, after the grant was made,
the State would apportion out the land, and watch
those boys who were about to squat He said if
pre-emption rights were to be granted at all, he
would say hands off from all distinctions—let the
settlers stand upon equal termb every where The
land, he was told, was worth three, four, and five
dollars an acre, and instead of allowing the State
of Indiana to speculate, and pocket the profit, he
would prefet to alter the law so a* to compel set-
tlers to pay those puces, and let the United States
have the profit.
Mi. DUNN replied with an argument to show
that it was proper to benefit the State, because the
principle of granting pre-emptions was intended to
reward those who went and settled the western
lands in advance of others, andsuch persons would
have the benefit of this provision.
Mr WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, opposed
the amendment, It was enough for him to know
that it proposed to benefit the Stale of Indiana,
and, if that State was to be benefitted, he wished to
know how a distinction could be drawn between
that Slate and others Why, he asked, should not
the old States be benefitted in, the íncreass of value?
or why should a preference be given to Jndiana
over other States containing public lands
Mr HEROD give an explanation of the situa-
tion in which these lands were, and advocated the
amendment
The question was then taken, and decided m the
negative
So the amendment offered by Mr. EWING was
rejected without a division
The question then recurred upon the original
amendment
Mr WHITE, of Indiana, again advocated the
amendment of Mr EWING, on the ground that
it would be brought forward hereafter as a distinct
proposition, and appeared to prefer it not embar-
rassing the pie-cmption bill.
Mr CASEY remarked that the amendment ap-
peared to han to be superfluous, on the ground that
the following clause in the body of the bill, would
exclude the Miami Reserve—it was in these words
" That this act shall not be so construed as to give
aright of pre-emption to any person, or persons,
in consequence of any settlement or improvement
made bstore the extinguishment of the Indian title
to the laud on which such settlement or improve-
ment was made "
Mr BOON remarked that it Mr Casey's con-
struction was the correct one, still the amendment
of the Committee on the Public Lands could do no
harm, as it might make the bill itself less objec-
tionable to those who were opposed to it
Mr GOODE then moved to amend the amend-
ment by granting the reserved alternate sections at
the price of $2 50 per acre, on the Miami canal
line, m that State, to the State of Ohio, except those
sections now settled and improved.
Mr SNYDER hoped the amendment of the gen-
tleman fiom Ohio would not prevail It proposed
to grant an exclusive right to the State of Ohio, in
exclusion to individuals. The present bill is one
extending to the settlers on public lands the right of
pre-emption to one quarter section Its pnnciples
are general and equitable, ib object is to protect the
labor of the poor man from the rapacity of the
wealthy speculator. The proposition of the gen-
tleman will embarrass, if adopted, the progress and
passage of this bill, and I deny that it is consonant
with the principles of the measure now under con-
sideration. This bill extends to the settlers
on the public lands protection, and a guar-
antee for their labor, and, on the other
hand, the proposition of the gentleman from
Ohio would engross the most valuable lands
exclusively for the State of Ohio, and refuse the
right of pre-emption to the settlers on that portion
of the public domain. I, for one, cannot consent
that this bill shall be so encumbered. If the pro-
position of the gentleman from Ohio has merit ,
I will vote for it in a separate and distinct bill
There has been abundant time during all of this
long session to propose his measure , there is yet
time I hope the friends of a pre-emption will
join me in voting down this amendment, so that
this important bill for the relief of a most meri-
torious class of citizens will stand on its own merit,
ard speedily meet with the favorable action of this
House When the principles of this bill come up
for discussion, I shall avail myself of the occasion
to present my views more fully on the subject
The amendment of the House committee was
then agreed to.
The next amendment was in relation to certain
fraction-, in Palmyra district, Missouri, which was
agreed to
Mr UNDERWOOD moved an amendment, the
effect of which was to prevent persons from getting
moie than one pre-emption
Mr LINCOLN remarked ¡hit he had submitted
the following amendment, when the bill was ori-
ginally reported
" To nisei t in the 25th line, after the words
United States, the following words 'Nor shall the
benefit of this act extend to any person who has
before availed himself of a pie-emption light to the
entry of any of the public lands, and acquired a
title thereto by reason of such entry '"
Mr. UNDERWOOD having temporarily with-
drawn his, Mr Lincoln moved the above
Mr U said the gentleman's amendment did not
provide for the mode of ascertaining the fact, and
hi" therefore preferred his own and moved it, as it
required the settler to set forth his disclaimer on
oath
Mr LINCOLN'S objection to that was, that he
always disapproved of putting an individual's
rights on the laith of his own testimony It was a
dangerous piactice, and he, therefore, preferí ed his
own amendment
Mr L then went at large into a review of the
bill, and contsnded for the right of the old States to
the public lands m common with the new States,
and that they should not be given away eithei to
settlers or to new States He was in favor of
granting these pre-emption lights to settlers, but
wished to restrict them, so that the same person
could not take one pie-emption after anothei, and
thus cover an undue quantity of land He also
made and aigued the point, that a pre-emption
right should be gained only by some service in
making improvements, and that merely because he
staid on a quarter section of land ovei night he
should not acquue a right to purchase it in the
morning He went upon the ground, that lands
not offered for ^ale by the Government might be
secured by pioneers, who settled and improved the
land, but that a mere temporary stopping should
not give a pre cmption light, because he did no
good to the country and performed no service to
entitle him to the right He would offer an amend-
ment to make the residence four months next pre
ceding the first of December, so that those who
went and sowed wheat, and felled timber, and esta-
blished a house, should acquire a right to it, and
not be liable to be turned out houseless after he
had done the service of a pioneer and had become
a citizen and a resident Such an amendment he
thought as liberal as Western people could justly
ask, and, coupled with the one then before the
committee, that the pioneer should have but one
pre-emption right, instead of allowing him to mono-
polize, he was willing to go for the bill Should
such propositions be called illiberal, he was willing
to be denounced here and at home, but he would
also be willing to appeal to a jury of Western men,
to decide upon their justice.
Mr L then discussed the policy of the measure
as affecting the pnces of lands and the interests of
the old States.
Mr MAY moved an amendment to extend ft 
law granting pre emption rights to any persons
who may now or shall hereafter have lived twelve
months upon the public lands, and, after some re-
marks upon objections made by Mr Lincoim to
the bill in its present shape, he went at length into
an argument to show the expediency of the mea-
sure he proposed to insert in the bill
Mr BOON replied to the remarks of Mr. Lin-
coln, chieily to the point relative to obtaining suc-
cessive and separate pre-emption rights. He did
not think such occurrences could take place often,
and if it did now and then, when an actual settler
moved from one location to a better, he thought ns
evil would accrue
Mr LINCOLN said, according to his notion, the
person who removed in such a manner was a spe-
culator
Mr LOOMIS spoke at length in favor ofactual
settlers upon the public lands, and was m favor of
affording them every facility which could be grant-
ed, i  ith proper safeguards against frauds. He
was opposed to selling the lands in large quanti-
ties to non-residents, to hold and sell hereafter If
any benefit was to acGiue from an increase of va-
lue, it ought to go to actual settlers, or remain to
the United States, instead of being given to specu-
lators. He did not understand the policy of con-
fining the application of the bill to settlers up to
December last, and did not see why it should not
be brought down to the present time, or to tho
first of June, and he read a letter from a western
correspondent to show that it would be a hardship
to those who came a little later than the day set,
jnd had been compelled to settle upon lands not
brought into the market, with ihe expectation of
acquiring a pre-emption right He proposed to
offer an amendment at the end ef the bill, to pro-
vide for a piospective system of settling and aci
quiring pre-emption rights, when such an amend-
ment should be m order.
Mr RANDOLPH moved that the committee
rise, with a view to have the amendments printed
Mr GARLAND of Louisiana wished that a
vote might be taken on some of the merely veibal
amendments already offered He had some time
since proposed an amendment, and had it pnnte 1,
which he intended to offer as a substitute for the
bill, but, since then, he had, upon consultation
with a competent officer of the land office, made
some very important alterations, and he had a
stionghope that it would now meet the assent of a
large majority of the House
Mr RANDOLPH again moved that the com-
mittee rise, but gave way to
Mr LINCOLN, who moved another amend-
ment, with a view to have it printed with the rest
Mr RANDOLPH then renewed his motion to
rise, which was carried in. the affirmative, and the
committee rose and reported
By general consent, the bill and various amend-
ments pending, and notice of given, were all order-
ed to be printed for the us® of the House
Mr BRONSON moved to take up the bill in re-
ation to the Rock River and Lake Michigan
Canal
Mr WILLIAMS of North Carolina moved an
adjournment  lost—only 29 voting for it
The above bill was then taken up, the question
being on concurring with the Committee of the
Whole m sundry amendments
Mr WHITE of Indiana moved several vifrba!
amendments, which we-c agreed to, as did also
Mr McKAY
Mr PETRIKIN moved an amendment giving
the State the equity of revocation, but it wav disa
greed to
The bill was then ordered to a third leading

Sundry bills from the Senate were taken up,
