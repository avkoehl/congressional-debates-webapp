assigned to duty; they were not allowed to incur any expense without his authority, and no accounts were to be paid unless approved by him. The necessity for recruiting officers to pay for expenses incurred by them in the subsisting, lodging, and transportation of recruits was entirely obviated, and had they all followed the regulations governing the recruiting service and the special instructions given them there would have been no claims for reimbursements since March, 1864.

While the recruitment of volunteers was under the control of the State authorities it was exceedingly easy for dishonest parties to make out and present fraudulent claims, and it is believed that many accounts of this kind were paid by disbursing officers. This became so apparent that General Orders, No. 198, of December 3, 1862, were issued, prohibiting disbursing officers from paying any accounts for recruiting expenses incurred prior to July 1, 1862, until they had been audited and ordered to be paid by the War Department.

Under the present system but few, if any, fraudulent claims have been paid.

5, 1861-the date of first appropriation-

In arriving at the foregoing statement no consideration has been taken of the amount paid by disbursing officers since May 1, 1863, for recruiting expenses incurred prior to that date, as it is believed that amount is certainly as great, most probably greater, than the amount now due for recruiting expenses incurred since May 1, 1863, but not yet paid.

It will be seen by this statement that, although the premium on gold and cost of subsistence, lodgings, rent of officers, stationery, &amp;c., was much higher in 1864-"65 than in 1861-"62, yet the expense of putting each man into the service was nearly four times greater during the first two years of the war than it was during the last two years.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
