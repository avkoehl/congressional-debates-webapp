Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: Wright very heavily engaged in the front. A new brigade being put in beyond the wooded ridge. In front of Mott's old position is an open space, and beyond this the troops are engaged. Our troops are cheering, and I think the firing recedes.

THEODORE LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel. Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.

N. B.- I cannot find General Wright. No one seems to know where he is, I am well in front, near General Neill. Bullets thick.

MAY 12, 1864 - 8.45 a. m.

[General MEADE:]

GENERAL: General Wright is in support of General Hancock with his two movable divisions, except three brigades, which overlap on the right. He has sent to General Warren for any disposable troops to cover his right. General Russell is hard pressed on the right; General Neill going to him. I am with General Wright.

THEODORE LYMAN.
