W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 18, 1863.

Major-General STUART,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your note of this date is received.

Let me know, as soon as you can, the truth of the report that the enemy has occupied Snicker's Gap in force and is advancing upon Ashby's Gap. This may oblige us to move up the Valley. I do not understand where Jones' pickets are, but the Sixth [Virginia Cavalry] Regiment, which you state are at Ashby's Gap and cannot recross the river, will have to retire southward along the mountain, if pressed, checking the enemy all they can. I wish you to endeavor to ascertain the exact condition of things-whether this force is simply cavalry, or whether the enemy's infantry is moving in that direction.

I am, respectfully and truly obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, July 18, 1863.

Richmond, Va.:

It is very seriously threatened. They have driven in my troops from Raleigh to Mercer Court-House, and a cavalry raid, 1, 300
