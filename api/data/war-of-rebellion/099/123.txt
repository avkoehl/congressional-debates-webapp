hear that a battery and obstructions have been felt on the Ashepoo, and much alarm at our reconnaissance. The Pawnee will go there and try to knock it down. It is said to be twenty miles up the Ashepoo. If General Howard's men feel that way it might prove of interest.

General EASTON, Savannah:

You may employ any vessels suitable for deep water, carrying soldiers, wagons, or ammunition of the Right Wing as long as General Logan wants you, but do not relax your efforts to get food and forage up to Sister's Ferry by the time Davis gets there. Weather is now fine, and if it lasts will make our roads fine in a very short while. On this clear spell we must reach Barnwell and the Augusta road. Keep things moving night and day. I go to Pocotaligo to-day.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Your telegram received. The Fifteenth Corps still have here, to go by water, about 3,400 men, 2,400 animals, 280 wagons, and 16 ambulances. I will get them off as soon as possible.

In the absence of any orders or instructions I directed the Michigan Engineers to accompany the Fourteenth Corps, which column seemed to need their services. They marched yesterday about 1 o'clock. Shall I recall them?
