HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, AND NORTH CAROLINA,Fort Monroe, March 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Brigade Colored Troops:

GENERAL: I have the thank you and the portion of your command that were with you for the prompt assistance rendered by yourself and command in the menace of the Confederates upon Suffolk. The willingness and promptness with which you acted are worthy of all praise. I am only sorry that the exigencies of the service take yourself and your troops out of my command.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 7, 1864.

Colonel G. H. SHARPE:

What brigades, besides those of Johnson's division, were reported to have been sent to Chancellorsville and other points to intercept Kilpatrick? I have mislaid the memorandum you sent in about it. Let me see you as soon as you have looked up this information.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 7, 1864-3. 30 p. m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Measures are being taken to provide transportation by water for Kilpatrick's command from Yorktown to Alexandria. He cannot move for two or three days. He has forage.

WASHINGTON, March 7, 1864-10. 50 a. m.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

General Halleck wishes to delay orders about General Kilpatrick until later in the day. General Meigs has not returned. It will be necessary to hear from Fort Monroe before moving General Kilpatrick. In the mean time transportation will be assembled to bring him to Alexandria, if finally decided that he shall come by water. We can have boats enough in sixty hours to bring up 1,000 at a trip. Dumfries is a bad place to land at; it would be better to land at Alexandria.

RUFUS INGALLS

Brigadier General and Chief Quartermaster, Army of the Potomac.
