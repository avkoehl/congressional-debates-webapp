Senator, I do not think there is any object in
reading it.
Mr. CONNESS. It is not of the slightest
consequence to have it read.
Mr. RAMSEY. With the consent of the
Senate, I will offer a few amendments at the
request of Senators, and then let the bill pass
without its reading.
The PRESIDENT, pro tempore. The read-
ing will be dispensed with, if there be no ob-
jection.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move to amend the amend-
ment by inserting under the head of "Mis-
souri" the following:
From Trenton, in Grundy county, Missouri, via
Edinburg, Grubb Town and Bolton, to Bethany, in

Mr. TRUMBULL. That bill has not been
read, and in my experience in the Senate it is
the first bill that the Senate ever passed with-
out being read. I think it had better be read.
It has always been the practice to have every
bill read.
