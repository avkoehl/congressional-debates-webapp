it am I to be punished for his fault? It ia wrong
in principle.
Besides' all this, I wish to call the attention of
the House to a remark which I made before, that
in order that this experiment of a reduction of
postage shall succeed, and the number of letters
largely increased, we muft put no obstacle in the
way of any person throwing his letters into the
mail. You do put an obstacle in the way the
moment you require prepayment, and the moment
you say that a prepaid letter shall go at a less rate
than one that is not prepaid.
I trust, therefore, that the House will adhere to
the vote taken, and declare that all letters passing
through the mails shall be charged with the uni-
form rate of three cents, and not attempt to check
the entrance of all letters into the mails by requi-
ring, either directly or indirectly, the prepayment
of postage.
The question being taken on the amendment of
Mr. Ashmun to the amendment of Mr. Brown,
of Indiana, tellers were demanded and ordered, '
and Messrs. Phelps, and J. A. King, of New |
York, were appointed.
The question being taken, the tellers reported I
71 in the affirmative and 74 in the negative. j
The tellers stated that they were dissatisfied j
with the count, and asked that permission might I
be granted for a recount. The Chairman directed a j
recount; which being had, the tellers reported,
ayes 85, noes 69. 1
' So the amendment to the amendment was agreed
to.
The question then recurred on agreeing to the i
amendment of Mr. Brown, as amended, and tell-
ers being called for, Messrs. Botd and Andrews
were appointed. ^
Mr. HOLMES moved that the committee rise.
Mr. PRESTON KING called for tellers, and
they were ordered.
The question was then taken by tellers (Messrs.
J. A. King and Ewing) on the motion that the
committee rise, and decided in the affirmativeâ€”
ayes 73, noes 55.
So the committee rose, and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, the Chairman [Mr. Burt] re-
ported that the committee had had the Union gen-
erally under consideration, and particularly the
cheap postage bill, and had come to no resolution
thereon.
On motion by Mr. CLINGMAN, the House
then adjourned.
