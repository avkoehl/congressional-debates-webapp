All   WRIGHT observed mat he was not then
disposed to occupy the time of tl e Senate by dis
cussing t1 e subject of this bill      The committee
had repoucd it with a view to the sute of me
Treasuiy, is indicated by the S ci tmyn  nisan
I nuil lepoit      Ihai exhibit showed  that 1 y 11<*
' 1st of Jinuaiy diete wou'd  be no inon.,}   in the
Iieasuiy te i   the pa} ment op tins fouith instad
j ment, and theicwas noant eipation of mat officer |
that there wool 1 b   any moneys foi  the puipose
by the 1st of Jtnuaiv th leafier      The commit
tee belieted, as he did, that the time had aimed (
when the Treasiu v had pan d with ail the money
that it could spaie, and cany o i the opeiations
of the Government, without ca'hng on the States   |
foi the repayment of the installments they had
already íeceived      He knew of no'hmg which
promised that the Treasury would be able to spaie
! this money by the 1st of January, IS-fO, and theie
i foie must oppose the amendment   Havins made
this explanation, he would content hims If with
| asking t n tin yeas and nays on the qui.st on
1     Mi   CL 1Y, of Kentucky   said tl at he con
tossed he was uttei ly unable to know what would
be the condition of the Tieisuiy by the time
mentioned, and this, he bell ved, was more than
was piactioabie foi anybody to know, fot, after
the defalcations of two public offieeis which had
1 itely come to Ii ¿lit, to the astonishmi nt of this
country—t ne foi j.1 000,000, and tl e amount of
the othei as yet unknown—no one could possi-
bly tell One thing they did know, and that was,
if they could get back this money, o anypait
of it, the state of the lreasiny would be very
different fiom what it would be with the total
loss of it He knew nothing as to the amount
ot these defalcations, oi as to the means of the
Government to íecoveí back the whole or any
pait of them, md theicfore would nothazaidany
calculations as to their probable valup Thegen-
tlemin fiom NewYoik could not say that the
Trt asm y would be in a condition to pay this
money by the 1st of Tanuary, 1840, that was
%eiy tiue Such was the nature of oui financial
eonctins that no man could say with certainty, a
yeai befoiehand, what oui leccipts tnd expend-
limes would amount to, but he would observe
that, if it should be, found when the time came
lound, tin Tieasuiy was not m a condition to
iicot this payment, theie would be the same
powci m Congicss that theie now was to post-
pone it foi another year But what he wanted
to see wis that the act of Congitss piovidmg for
this d< posit should be fulfilled, and the pledge re-
deemed, by cany mg out the assuianct s given by
that act Some gttater secuuty would be given
to the States that they would eventually receive
this money, if a definite day was fi^ed foi the
postponement, than if it was loft, as providcdfor
in the bill, for the future action of Congicss If
it was postpmed till the 1st day of Jinuaiy,1840,
i still finthci postponement would íequire the
ions nt ot both blanches of the Li gislature, as
xv111 as f the Ejt on ivi whereas, if the bill
¡ essn 1 ii its pi sent sh ipe, it would amount to
in i ¡id 1 nte post) incinuit, without a special act
of Goi ,ie , san tioncd by the Executive He
w is ghd the yeas and nxys had been called, as
he wislitd to lecord his vote in favor of continu-
ing tin h po th it the deposit act would be tvent
ually cat mu out
Mi WRIGHT ie; lied that it wat, not his in-
tuition now to enter into a discussion of the la
mentabie defalcations which had 1 itely come to
light He had not the inclination to enable him
to speak to th it body intelligibly on the subject
All he knew with icgard to them wis deuved
fiom glancing at the very voluminous ícpoit of the
Secietaiy, which had been oideied to be pinned,
and which was not yet laid upon th a tubles He
was as much devoid of information on the subject
as thr Sen ttoi who last addressed them But this
much he would say, that if this matter was not
thoi mbhly uudeistiod by Congicss, and by the
whole eountiy, befoie the Close of the session, it
would not b hi* fault It was his fi-íed puipose
to hue ati oiousrh mvestig ition of the whole sub
ject a< <] to let his constituents know the whole
tiuth Then, is n the bill befoie them it was
no* his purpose to hoi I out to the States exoect
ati ins tin he d <1 not believe could be reah?ed
In S"pteinbei list, the Committee on Emance ¡no-
pi ed tlu sime postponement of this installment,
and on the same teims that they now did Foi
hiuiselt, he thought that the time Had gone by
when they were authorized to hold out mv ex-
I eolations to tne States tiom a suiplus in the
Tieasuiy, though, atthe same time, he agieed that
he had no power to look forvvaid and say pre-
cisely what would be the condition oí the Iieas-
uiy at the end of anothei yeai He had no in
foimation which enabled him to say th  this
i istallment could be met on the lit of January,
1810, easiei tu n it now cculd
\lr CALHOL~\ si 1 he should vote for the
postponen f nt moved by the Setiatoi irom Ken-
tucky, tl ough he had rot the slightest anticipa-
tion tint tin ie w 3ul 1 be any suip'us m nn Tieas
urv eithei in tins ot m the coming vcai Ihe
question would then nuuially occur wny he gave
sue i a v o a The answ er w as in the first place,
that it could do no harm, and in the next place,
it would nave the cflect to check this House m
its expendituies If the expendí uies had not
i ei n so piofuse last yeai, theie might then inve
