HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Pulaski, Tenn., November 23, 1864.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Commanding Third Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: The advance of Hood's army reached Lawrenceburg last evening. General Hatch thinks Forrest is moving to the left to strike the railroad between Lynnville and Columbia. General Hatch has moved his force in front of Lynnville to the vicinity of Campbellsville. I will join you at Lynnville about noon to-day. Have your command ready to move, if it becomes necessary. I think Forrest will strike about Pleasant Grove or Hurricane. If you have information that he is moving in that direction, move at once to check him, leaving Wagner until I arrive. I only want to hold the railroad until I can get all the stores from here, when I will withdraw to Columbia.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
