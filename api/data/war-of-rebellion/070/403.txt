COLUMBUS, May 7, 1864-10.30 a. m. (Received 11.05 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Two regiments leave here for Parkersburg this morning. I could send two more to-night, but accouterments have not arrived, and Captain Bradford cannot say when they will come to hand. He is exerting himself all he can to aid the movement, but these things are in freight cars somewhere on the road. The mustering force is now up to our requirements.

JNO. BROUGH,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 7, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

The accouterments complete were forwarded some days ago with special messenger and orders for quick dispatch. Can you not stimulate the railroad companies? An unofficial report represents the engagement of yesterday as not decisive, but the advantage appearing to be on our side. We have not telegraphic communication with the front. The battle is no doubt progressing to-day. The Department has exhausted its means of hurrying up your accouterments, but I hope you will receive them to-day. Push on the troops to Cumberland via Wheeling.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
