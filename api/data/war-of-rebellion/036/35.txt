HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD, May 6, 1863,VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 12.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Ferrying and transportation of rations to Grand Gulf is detaining us on the Big Black River. I will move as soon as three days' rations are received, and send wagons back to the Gulf for more to follow. Information from the other side leads me to believe the enemy are bringing forces from Tullahoma. Should not General Rosecrans at least make a demonstration of advancing?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, Number 32. HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE TENNESSEE, In Field, Hankinson's Ferry, MISS., May 7, 1863.

Soldiers of the Army of the Tennessee! Once more I thank you for adding another victory to the long list of those previously won by your valor and endurance. The triumph gained over the enemy near Port Gibson, on the 1st instant, is one of the most important of the war. The capture of five cannon and more than 1,000 prisoners, the possession of Grand Gulf, and a firm foothold upon the highlands between the Big Black and Bayou Pierre, from whence we threaten the whole line of the enemy, are among the fruits of this brilliant achievement. The march from Milliken's Bend to a point opposite Grand Gulf was made in stormy weather, over the worst of roads; bridges and ferries had to be constructed; moving by night as well as day, with labors incessant and extraordinary, privations have been endured by men and officers as have rarely been uttered. A few days' continuance of the same zeal and constancy will secure to this army the crowning victory over the rebellion. More difficulties and privations are before us. Let us endure them bravely. A grateful country will rejoice at our success, and history will record it with immortal honor.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Our advance is 15 miles from Edwards Station, on Southern Railroad. All looks well. Port Hudson is undoubtedly evacuated, except by a small garrison and their heavy artillery.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAYUGA, MISS., May 11, 1863,

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 18.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

My forces will be this evening as far advanced toward Jackson as Fourteen-Mile Creek - the left near Big Black River, and extending in a line nearly east and WEST - as they can get without bringing on a general engagement.
