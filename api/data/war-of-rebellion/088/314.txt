from the enemy's main line of works, who appear in the same force as yesterday. The Second Brigade (Colonel Wheelcock) remains the same as last evening, both line of battle and skirmish line. The skirmish line is about 150 yards in front of the battle line, and about the same distance from the enemy's line of works. No apparent change in the force or line of the enemy. The First Brigade (Colonel Lyle) also remains unchanged, connecting on the left with the Second Division. The skirmish line of the enemy has retired 300 yards to the center of the corn-field and Colonel Lyle has advanced his skirmishers to near the edge of woods. Wounded men report that in retiring the enemy gained ground to their right.

Lieutenant Colonel FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Army Corps:

COLONEL: There is no apparent change in the position or force of the enemy in my front, except that they have retired their skirmish line about 300 yards opposite the front of my left brigade. The skirmish line of that brigade has been advanced accordingly, preserving the connection with the skirmishers of the Second Division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The connection with the Ninth Corps picket is formed. They connect about one-fourth of a mile from the Aiken houses, bearing 10 degrees north of east. I shall make the line as straight as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 10.15 a. m.

General CRAWFORD:

From what I can learn by Major Roebling, you have not got the connection with the Ninth Corps at all where I wanted it. I wish it to begin on the extreme right of the reserves, then in a northeast direction to the angle in the picket-line where I went with you, if it can be done. If not, then as nearly there as you can. This will enable the line to watch the enemy toward Petersburg; will not take half the men you now
