General GRANT, Culpeper, Va.:

Schofield is now at Charleston, and will move to Cleveland. Thomas will concentrate at Ringgold, and McPherson's troops are all in motion toward Chattanooga, and by may 5 I will group them at Rossville and Gordon's Mills. The First move will be: Thomas, Tunnel Hill; Schofield, Catoosa Springs, and McPherson, Villanow. Next move will be battle. I have Atlanta dates 29th of April. Enemy has a general idea of our plans, and are massing about Richmond and Dalton. Nothing new in the papers, except that General Polk reports, under date Demopolis, 23rd of April, that Wirt Adams had captured and burned a gun-boat at Yazoo City, taking on shore eight 24-pounder guns. Weather fine; roads very good. I leave John E. Smith's division at Huntsville and Decatur till Blair gets there with the Seventeenth Corps, when I will bring forward more men, according to the issues of our first battle. A good deal of the enemy's cavalry is hanging about North Alabama, and McPherson is uneasy about Decatur; but we must risk something. I have removed the bridge at Larkin's, and will try and get one of the new gun-boats to patrol the river from Bridgeport down. Thomas is here,b ut we will all go out on the 5th. I will expect further notice from you, but will agree to draw the enemy's fire within twenty-four hours of May 5.

Major-General.

Brigadier General J. D. WEBSTER, Nashville, Tenn.:

We cannot be too strict about prohibiting citizens on our roads. I will make no exceptions in favor of correspondents, who are mere traders in news like other men, who would make money out of the army. If any are here they stand a good chance for being impressed for soldiers or other labor. We cannot attempt to reconcile conflicting claims of the press.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
