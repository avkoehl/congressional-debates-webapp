EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Milledgeville, Ga., November 14, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Official engagements have prevented earlier attention to your letter of 8th ultimo, which reached me on the 20th. You are pleased to characterize a portion of my letter as acrimonious, and claim that I have transenced the bounds of official propriety and seem to desire me to understand that you labor under difficulties in restraining yourself within the bounds of forebearance in your reply. As the acrimony of my letter consisted in a simple narrative of truths, communicated in a plain, straightforward manner, calling things by their right name, I feel that I am due you no apology. Of course no personal disrespect
