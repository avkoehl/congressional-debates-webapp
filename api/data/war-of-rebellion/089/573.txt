General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I desire to call your attention to the extract from the Richmond papers signal Charles H, Day, One hundred and eighty-eight New York Volunteers, on eight page of to-day's Herald. Two of the men captured on my picket-line by Mahone the other night have already arrived at their home in New York State, paroled by the enemy. Letters have been received from them which I have called for. The firing to-night was brought on, General Mott reports, by the enemy firing on the relief to this picket-line as it was going round. It was quite light in the early part of the evening.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK

Major-General.
