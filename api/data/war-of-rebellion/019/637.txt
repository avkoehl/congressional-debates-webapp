wood that evening. I resumed the march at daybreak September 14, and arrived at the creek, about 1 mile east of Lamar, at 9 p. m., where I encamped the command for the night, stationing Captain Welch, in command of the mounted men of the Second Regiment Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, at Lamar.

Information and rumors here are very contradictory and unreliable. Some say Colonel Weer was forced to retreat; others state that he has, in co-operation with Missouri troops, advanced south of Carthage. My guide, Mr. Carpenter, whom I had sent with dispatches to Colonel Weer at the time of my departure from Fort Scott, communicating to him my march and the expected time of my arrival at Lamar, as directed by you, has not returned yet. I have sent strong reconnoitering parties toward Carthage and Horse Creek, and moved the whole command to Lamar this morning.

At 4 p. m. my messenger to Colonel Weer returned. I inclose copy of his report.* I will march at daybreak to-morrow toward Carthage, and intend to camp at Coon Creek.

I have no doubt Governor Ramsey is doing what he can to forward the movements for the defense of the frontier, but I have been sadly crippled for want of ammunition and rations, as well as proper clothing for the men. I can, however, wait no longer, and it is my intention to march if possible on the 17th or 18th instant. I have no mounted force except about 25 men, and they are far from efficient. My belief has been, and still is, that Ii shall be met in force by the Indians at Red Irons Village, or Lac-qui-Parle, as the accounts from all my sources of information agree in the statement that their men are all concentrated there, with the women and children and plunder; and they cannot well retreat if they would. In such case they will of course make a desperate stand, and endeavor to make our position as uncomfortable as possible in the way of night attacks, ambuscades, and the like. Still they will be met with their own weapons and in their own style of warfare, and I do not fear the result of any encounter, unless their re-enforcements from the Upper Sioux should enable them to take the field in numbers superior to my own and my raw troops should be panic struck, which I have little fear of now, since the skele-
