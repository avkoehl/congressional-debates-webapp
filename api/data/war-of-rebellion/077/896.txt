ago. Do not consider it reliable. I may get more reliable information to-night, as I have a force gone to feel of the enemy. Their pickets are only out three-quarters of a mile this side of the river.

P. S. - General Duke has just reported.
HEADQUARTERS VAUGHN'S CAVALRY,New Market, November 16, 1864-6 a. m.

CAPTAIN: We drove the enemy's pickets in last night only three- quarters of a mile out from the railroad bridge. Considerable commotion in their camp, like they were preparing to leave or fight; fight, I think, because the train ran so often yesterday. I have sent the scout toward Cumberland Gap, as directed, and have a few men gone tot he rear to gather information. No chance to cut the road in their rear only by a large force, as they have every point guarded. There are only two bridges, one within three and the other four miles from the Plains. Some negro troops were seen near the Plains yesterday - only three. Do you desire me to move down this morning to the Plains?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS VAUGHN'S CAVALRY,Mouth of Holston River, November 17, 1864-10 a. m.

CAPTAIN: I have driven in the enemy's pickets into their fortifications on all the roads this side of the river. Their works are too strong to carry by assault, I fear. I have sent a force to destroy the railroad bridge over Flat Creek. Their force is about that we have been calculating it to be. I shall await your orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.
