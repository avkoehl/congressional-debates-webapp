such cases it is the duty of the Representative to interpose his
power over the purse strings to disarm treason or corruption
I am inclined to think thatMi Miller, tne Fust Auditoi, does
not requ re such a remedy 1 believe he was not old m office
when the omissions of duty in relation to the Swartwout defal
cation occurred
[Here Mi Wist said he had been appointed thicc yeais be

Well, («aid Mr U) that is a pretty good app.enticesh p 1
seived with Mr Mi 1er, tw i yeais before his appointment, on
this flooi, and the opinion I foimed of his cl,.n acter was not tin
favorable I cannot think he acted corriif tly in íespect to the
Swartwout affair, and I think the ease is nntofsuffieientmdgm

Mr GORDON under ood his colleague [Ml J C Clark]
to say, and to repeat it thai the object of sulking out this ap
propnation from the bill was to drive this man out of office
NowheCMi G ) had suppused the first time he had ever read
the Constitution of the United states, that the powers of this
Government weie divided into Executive, Legislative and Ju
dicial powers He had suppeser), and he always undeistood
that the power of appointment and removal from office, except
in one s< li ary case, belonged to the Executive, the Senate coi
cuirmg in the appointment* That House had no power what
ever to remove any man from office, be 1 is station high or low
If an officei should be guilty of'conuption, the House might
Impeach him, and the Senate, who would try him on the im
peachment might dismiss him, hut thp House of itself had no
sueh power Now, were not the members on that floorswoin
to support the Constitution,and would not the lemoval of a
man from office in the manner proposed, without an impeach
ment and without a hearing, be a violation of that oath? This
must be the ground on winch the motion was based, fot the
appropriation was not to pay the officer for services rendered
before the ftv artwout defalcation, that time was past and gone,
but the appropuation was to pay fo- services performed during
the current yeai He woul 1 like to know if, in the distribution
of the powers of this Government, the power was constitu ion
ally vested in that House to block up effectually any one of the
branches of the Government
Sir, said Mr G the Executive can move on in itsp'oper
sphere, the Tu i lal Department can move on it l's proper
sphere, ai d the Leglsla'ive branch ran move on in its sphere, all
without usmping the powers of each oih r, andhedeiiiej that
either the judicial or I alslative branches could stop the wheels
of Government Ai the mischievius pulpóse of controlling the
Executive branch II that House could expel the Executive to
lemove a man from ( ffice by withholding his alaiy, he a^kel
if this wasrot the powei to b ock up the wheals of the Govern
ment? Was it not u ui ping theappinong pi'Ver byvithhohl

woithy ol office-! We sh mid have a strange and moma] ms Go
veimncnt, if this power were conceded to the House of Rtpre
sentatives No doubt, said Mr G we have the physical poner,
but I do doubt that we have the constitutional power to w th
hold the supplies necessary to cany on the Government If
this officer were guilty—and he wa  neithei his accuser nor de
fender—why had not the House by impeachment called on h'm
to answei at the bai of the Senate? That was the proper mode
ofproceedng against him, and not by stopping his salary and
compelling the I yecutive to ill miss him without a heanne

the Piesileut who po«se sp« the power t( apt    uimelit  n o
possesses the power of removal from office, was erroneous, was
it any less the law of thehindl If it was law, he asked the gen-
tleman from Kentucky whether he meant to extinguish that
law by the indirect unconstitutional usurpative act of tlia
House of Repiesentatives, or whethei he would not proceed to
change it m the tegular mode, by an am ndment to the Consti-
tution? Admitting that this construction was wrong, it was yet
the received tmpou of the Constitution, and, if it was to be
changed, they ought to proceed in the constitutional mode of
amendments to the Constitution, and when such amendments
weie before the House, he would discuss the mentsof theques-
ii >n and take i«sue with the gentleman f cm Kentucky on the
premises
Did the gentleman mean to argue that k was the policy and
interest of ihis oi any other Government, that die subordinaiei,
officeis, the cleiks under the bureaus, in the customhouses,
&p should be independent? lie a«ked the gentleman how it
was possible fir this Government to go oi if every man was
independí nt? iftheie were to be twenty five thousand different
wills?   Must there i o' be some ovei ruling will?
Mi UNDERWOOD (Mr G yielumg 1 im he floor) said, m
ansvvei to the gentleman n quiilng whether he was in favor of
making each *ubordmatc officer of the custom house and the
Government independent, that he would make every mans
duty under Government dependent on the definition given by
liw, and if he acted wiihm the scope of thoi authority of the
law he should be pi otect il, and he yvould make him so far in-
dependent asti pieventhim fiom being lemoved from office
yvhen hewasfulfiihnghis dutits irescnbed by the law He
would make every n dividual who holds an office responsible to
the law, and when he di«chaiged tha, he should not be limed
out at the mere will and pleasute of his superiors in office
Mr CUSHHNG said trie gent'eman had not met the difficulty
he presented The question he had put w as not a party ques-
tion between a subordinate and the head oí a buieau, but a
question of practical business, and he repeated the question,
was it possible, in an office of any denomination, for business
lo go on, unless there should be a directing will and a subordi-
nation to that directing will? And what was the answer of
the gentleman fiorn Kentucky? He professed that he would so
de*cnbe all the daily and hourly duties of the clerks in the De-
paitments, that theie might be nolhing left lo disci etion Tie
ai'of man could not devise thaw that should entei intoallthe
detailsor these matteis Ihey were things wh eh belonged to
ih crttien and should be governed by a directing will, and
with rtgaid to that be said il was totally impossible that Go
verr ment should go on unless iheie le a governing will m
these eases If the gentleman believed that in a n publican
countrv wh re legislation, as well as the choice of lega-
tors, yvas in the hinds of the peopl , the Govern-
ment could go on when the Government itself and ts sub-
ordinate ofücei were m perpetual coi fhet on any que* ion*,
