Lieutenant Colonel H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

uger marches from Christiana to-day; will be near Tullahoma, and take post from that south, including Elk River bridge. Three rear regiments will be this side of Tullahoma to-night and occupy the rest of my line; all will be in position to-morrow, I think. Which corps should guard Tantalon? It is embraced in orders to both; properly belongs to Eleventh Corps.
