HDQRS. U. S. FORCES OPERATING FROM PENSACOLA BAY,Barren Creek, Fla., March 23, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: It will take us until to-morrow noon at least to bridge this creek. All the streams are over their banks. The water has never been known to be so high. We shall be considerably delayed on this account. It is probable that all the bridges on the Perdido have been swept away. It would also be difficult for us to cross over to Mobile Bay now on account of high water. I sent to Barrancas for supplies to be sent up the Escambia by steamer. Rebel pickets were encountered on the march to-day, and a small force of cavalry was stationed on the north bank of Barren Creek. We have heard firing (we suppose in Mobile Bay) for several days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - We are obliged to corduroy at least one-fourth of the road, and from the best information I can obtain I think the roads are still worse beyond Barren Creek.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST FLORIDA,Barrancas, March 23, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: In connection with Special Field Orders, Numbers 12, extract 5, headquarter Army and Division of West Mississippi, directing that the last regiment of cavalry belonging to General Lucas' cavalry brigade when arriving at this place be retained in this district, I have the honor to report that only one company of the Fourth Tennessee Cavalry arrived two days ago. I am informed, however, by Major Perry, who came from New Orleans last night, that four companies of the same regiment came over with him but were retained at Navy Cove. The exigencies of the service seem to require that at least a moderate cavalry
