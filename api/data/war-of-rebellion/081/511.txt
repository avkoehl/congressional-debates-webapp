HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 29, 1864-12.55 p.m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,Wind-Mill Point, Va.:

Your dispatch from Wind-Mill Point of 8.30 a.m. is just received. I had by direction of the commanding general already sent an officer with a dispatch to meet you on the Prince George

Court-House, informing you that General Wilson was in the vicinity of Reams' Station, where the enemy's cavalry had concentrated to prevent his return, and directing you to move with all the expedition possible to Reams' Station to relieve General Wilson. The commanding general renews the order for you to move as rapidly as possible to that point. A division of the Sixth Corps is moving to Reams' Station to support General Wilson, followed by the remainder of the corps. General Wilson was unable to cross Stoney Creek last night. This crossing is near the Weldon railroad, about twenty miles from Petersburg. He sent Kautz to make a detour to the left with the trains, intending to follow at daylight. The head of Kautz's column reached the vicinity of Reams' Station this morning between 7 and 8 o'clock, and found the enemy in force and position there.
