could be brought up to the charge, and nothwr on earth was
more certain, than if myself particularly, placed by my office of
Vice President at the head oi the Repulicans, had given way
and withdrawn from my post, the Republicans throughout the
Union would have given upio despair, and the cause would
have been lost for ever By holding on, we obtained time for
the Stale Legislatures to come up with their weight and those
of Viraima and Kentucky particularly, but more especially
the former, by their celebrated resolutions, saved theConstitu
uonati  last gasp No person who was not a witness of the
scenes of that ¡rloomy period, can form an idea of the afflicting
persecutions and personal indignities we had to brook They
savwl our country however The spirits of the people were so
much subdued and reduced to despair, that they could hat e
sunk into apathy and monarchy, as the only foim of Govern
ment which could maintain itself •
Such, Mr President, was the terrorism with
which the Federal party surrounded itself forty
years ago, such its mode of action then, and such
its manner of acting on the public mind now.
The Presidential election of 1796 was earned by
terror, extracted from the French Revolution, the
election of 1800 came withm three votes of being
carried by the same means The second election
of Mr Jefferson prostrated Federalism—sent it in-
to a state of hibernation far north, and with it the
mythological deity of its worship, and the whole
machinery of terror and alarm The appearance
of General Jackson, at the head of the list of
Presidential candidates, in the winter of 1824-2r>,
and the events of the election of President at that
time by the Hou e of Representatives revived the
two primitive political parties—the Republican am'
the Federal—and w ith the latter, its distinctive pas-
sion for terror, alarm, and panic From that day
to the present, a succession of alarms has agitaied
the public mind Raw-heads-and-bloody-bones
have stalked in solemn procession over the public
stage. First, it was the military chieftain, who
was to put an end to the Republic at once, «ilh the
sword Then Congress was to be turned out ot
door , neck and heels Then the liberty of speech
was to be put down—to be suppressed by mam
force afterwards it was to be choked down by cor-
ruption Then camp a fright about pocketing
bilk General Jackson did not return the land
bill, which was sent to him too late to be returned,
and, thereupon, all bills were to be pocketed, and
all Federal legislation destroyed Alter thit, vte
had the Maysville Road bill veto alarm, and such
was the effect of this fright for some months, that
many good people believed that theie was going to
be a general destruction ot all roads, and tint all
travelling would be reduced to scrambling ihiough
the woods, camping out at night, and swimming
creeks and rivers like otters CAuick upon the heels
of this fright, came the National Bank bill veto
alaira. Then there wa« no mistake Destruction
had arrived Nationil wo had arrived Tlit
price of all produce and property was to sink to no-
thing, every man's estate was to perish on
his hands, black desolation was to sit upon the
land. From the contemplation of this rum,
the nation was suddenly roused up to the apparition
of the French war For three months, this spectre
of a French war kept its place on the public slage,
to the extreme irritation of the nervous sj stem of
aged ladies, and with vast expenditure of ink and
paper to the peace societies Tlit arrival of the
gold indemnities put an end to the fantasies' of tins
poor spectre These brief and various little panics
were preludes to the great one—the deposite-remo-
val panic of 1833-34 This was a panic indeed,
not only great in Hsell, but the prolific parent of a
progeny of subaltern alarms Orators here, and
bank screws elsewhere, worked up the nation to a
paroxysm of consternation Great was the terror
excited, and great the mischief inflicted For six
months, this chamber was the laboratory of alarm,
the distress flag flying, the tocsin beating, and the
alarm guns firing, all the while the Bank of the
United States turning the screws on her debtors,
to the sound of our music, and, with each scream
ol its suffering victims, exulttngly demanding if
the distress had not arrived1
The revolution without bloodshed—the expul-
sion of this body from its chamber by a military
force—and the Protest, which was to wipe out the
Constitution—were among the prominent scenes of
that magnificent panic The revolution was, in
itself, a curiosity It began m the middle, carried
itself on without bloodshed, and ended without a
catastrophe    That it has ended, I myself do know
I know it of my own knowledge, and can tell you
how You remember, sir, we ware then informed
that, in revolutions, there were no Sabbaths Now,
I have seen Sabbaths since that lime myself. I
have seen the people at church, worshipping, and
keeping the Sabbath. This is conclusive, it is
proof incomestible that the revolution has ended
Bloodless, we know it to have been Wit iout a
catastrophe, we know it was There was no list
of killed and wounded, but there were some crip-
pled and lamed—a certain catalogue of Presiden-
tial candidates, architects of panic, were gravelled
on that occasion They became what the "safe
and solid specie-paying" bank notes aie m the
Treasury—on unavmlabt* fund' They ended with
finding themsehes hms rfu. combat, not horses of
combat, as a worthy friend of mine is accustomed
to read {hat French phrase, but stabled animals,
withdrawn from the turf, tied up to the rack, soli-
tary and alone, to digest their provender at their
leisure
The Senate expulsion panic, though severe at the
time, is hardly to be regretted, on aceount of the
noble spirit which it caused to be developed in this
body When the first tidings arrived ot General
Jackson's design to evpel the Senate by (orce of
irms, then was seen whit stuff our heaitswere
made of. Incontinently patnotic indignation rose
to the highest pitch, and courageous resolutions ex-
hibited themselves m daring forms Some propos-
ed to go forth, and bravely meet the advincing
danger Others pieferred to arm the doorkeeper,
the messengers, and the boyswith sticks and itavts,
and to plant them behind the jambs of the doois
Others, like ancient Romans, deemed it more sein-
tonal to abide the event, in a sitting postule, not in
curule, but in their leather back chairs While still
in this fearful condition, the portentous Protest ar-
rived, to heighten the evcitmg scene, to multiply its
penis, and to superadd alarm for the safety oi
our beloved Constitution to ihe personal conster-
nation we endured on account ol our oh n necks
and limbs How the Seinte her ime reliet ed from
this double peril is mattei of history, which Ihe
tong e of eloquence Ins alrcidy immoitihral on
this floor, and which the pen ol truth willfaithtully
transmit to a remote generation Virginia curie to
the rescue1 Hanover county did ihe business1 We
all remember (hat day when in oritor of this body,
using in his place, announced to us the glorious re-
sults of the precinct elections it Long Tom, Slow
and Hungry, Negro Foot, and Hell Town, and con-
cluded with a declaration thai he had heard the last
knock of the hammer on the last nail m the coffin
of Jacksonism At this annunciation onr spirits
rose The Senate breathed Ireer anddeepei We
all began to feel like Brutuscs, ready to bran-
dish high our gleaming steel, and call on li-
berty, and bid Ihe faihers of their country had1
for, lo, the tyrant down, and we again all free
Bhi, alas' the mutability of humm events!
quickly we found ourselves in ihe condition of the
poor fisherman in ihe Arabian Nights, who had
corked up the terrific genu in a bottle, from which
the ^iant spectrt bad empiged to fill all space ttilh
the expansion of lus boundless form, to oversha low
ihe who'e earth with his endless height, and to
mtnice the luckless fi herman v, ith instant anni-
hilation So of the Senile, ind us coffined Jack-
sonism We had it m the coffm, we nailed it
up , we were sure of it We considered Jickson
done for ever, jet he reappeared on the political
stage with more power than ever, and with such
effect upon the vision, that those who affirmed to
us on this floor that they saw him coffined, now
declare that he is still President of these United
States, ruling the country with a rod of iron, and
menacing all existing institutions with instant
ruin
Subordinate to these great alarms, Mr President,
were three small ones, which filled up the year
1834 There was the gold bill alarm, which was
to debase the currency, and deprive the country
of silver , the Safety Fund system alarm, in which
the Albany regency were to extend corruption and
intrigue to the uttermost boundaries of the Union,
and the pet bank alarm, m which the country was
to be ruined precisely to the same extent, by a
conjunction with the banks, that it now is by a
separation from them.
After so much agnation there was repose for a
little while. We rested nearly two years, until
the year 1836 In that year, the Treasury order
appeared, and the occasion was deemed a favor-
able one for the revivification of panic and disttess.
A signal gun was fired from the Chestnut street
palace, in the form of a letter from the president
of the Bank of the United States to an ex-President
of the United States. A response to that signal
echoed from Kentucky, in ths shape of a barbecue
speech Congress met, the proper resolution was
introduced, panic speeches were let off A brave
effort was made, but to no purpose The country
refused to take fright, and that experiment upon
the public nerves died out.
The expunging panic then took its turn It was
a hard struggle for an alarm, but no progress could
be made at it. The people could not see the de-
struction of the Constitution, in the purification of
the Senate jom nal They could not see the de-
struction of the journal in the erasure of an iniqui-
tous sentence from it Far from being frightened
at the act, they ordered it to be done, and the
branded page will stand for ever as th¿ evidence of
a factious outrage on one side, and a monument of
national reparation on the other.
The Treasury order and the expunging panics
both failed. They were abortive experiments upon
the nervous system of the people. Nothing dis-
heartened, however, we find the Opposition gentle-
men now biavely engaged at the fabrication of
another. The Sub-Treasury bill panic is now the
order of the day, and the total destruction of all
banks—the total destruction of all credit—the sud-
den erection of a Treasury bank upon the rums of
all otheis—the exclusive imposition of Treasury
bank paper money currency upon the people, and,
at Ihe same time, the exclusive imposition also of a
hard money currency upon them, these are the raw-
heidw-md bloody-bones which are now paraded be-
foie the eyes of the people A certain speech deli-
vered on this floor, the title page of whictj will
claim a prominent place in the next emission of
coffin handbills, is the congeries of these new hor-
rors—collected, compounded, and conglomerated
into one huge and frightful mass With the deli-
very of that speech went forth the authoritative
mandate for the new panic, but in vam. The peo
pie are tired of being scared They refuse to take
fright any more Calm as a summer's morning,
they read with indifference the progiamme for the
alarm, and view with contempt the marshalling of
the procession of the hobgoblins, phantoms, and
spectres which are put in requisition for the ensu-
ing elections The country is quiet. But, behold
the symptoms of panic m another quarter' The
panic makers themselves are beginning to take
fright' The temh day of May approaches, and
with it the elevation of that RESUMPTION FLAG
which will cheer the hopes of all Republicans, and
impress with terror the fainting hearts of the broken
bank and shm-plaster party
Thus we have gone on ever since the appearance
of General Jackson on the political stage, and the
coincident revival of the old political parties of
1798 Terror is the chosen agent of action upon
the public mind now as it was then, but with this
great difference, that the phantoms then brought
forward to frighten the people into measures, were
solely directed to the nervous system, and never
combined with any attack upon the business ope-
rations of the country People were then to be
frightened out of their votes, but not deprived of
wors and labor, or ruined m their trade and occu-
pation Now the assault is double—it is both up-
on the nerves of the man, and upon his bread.
The famous Glueen Elizabeth, m stopping the in-
come of the refractory Earl of Essex, said, an unr
governable beail must be deprived ofhisjnovender. So
of the present Opposition tactics in our own coun-
try Stop his bread—make him feel—tum him
out to graze, this is the language of the
day An immense moneyed institution, able
to create the distress which it foretells, has
brought this Queen Elisabeth ingredient into
the composition of modern Federal panics, and
now every successive attempt at alarm k accom-
