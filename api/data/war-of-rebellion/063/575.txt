Have any of the Sixth Missouri State Militia arrived at Cassville from Yellville? Have the commanding officer report by telegraph as soon as he arrives. Do you hear anything from Brown's command or anything from any enemy?

Colonel JOHN E. PHELPS,

Commanding in the Field, south of White River:

COLONEL: It seems now to be settled that General Steele has been compelled to retreat to Little Rock, and General Price's army has followed him up. Some of his cavalry may cross the Arkansas River and attempt to annoy you. If you remain south of the White river you should keep patrols well out and be sure and not be surprised. The country is so destitute of provisions that it would seem impossible for a very large force to subsist in Arkansas a great while. but the rebels may have facilities for living that we do not, and it is better to be prepared for them.

I sent word last night for you not to hurry about moving back, and to bring everything back with you. You may, however, leave subsistence for the home guards formed there, say, thirty days' subsistence, where it can be done with the assurance that it will not fall into the hands of the enemy. You will drive out with you all abandoned property, including cattle, sheep, and horses, and drive them forward to this point. Two squadrons of your regiment that have the smallest number of horses will be sent to Berryville, or some point in that vicinity where they can get grass and remain at that post. As your movement will uncover that point and make it an outpost it must be made stronger. You may get good grass on Rolling or Sugar Loaf Prairie; if so, you can remain there a few days, if you choose. The main point is to find good grass. Write and let know also on as you move.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

All officers and men of your command in Lebanon on that night will be taken before a justice of the peace or
