Major-General DIX;

General Burnside's army recrossed the Rappahannock during the night, and the pontoon bridge have been taken up. Raining hard there.

FORT MONROE, December 17, 1862.

General FERRY, Suffolk:

Have you tried the iron wagon-bodies to ascertain if they will answer the purpose of pontoons? I have ordered four new regiments of Pennsylvania Militia to you.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, December 17, 1862.

Major-General DIX:

Have tried the pontoons. They will not work. Will make full report by messenger to-morrow.

O. S. FERRY,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, December 18, 1862.

Brigadier-General FERRY:

I sent for Colonel Spear to ascertain the truth of reports in regard to rebel forces at Franklin. I have long desired to cross and capture or disperse them. I think it can be done. If you agree with me send Foster with 3,400 cavalry, Spear's regiment, and 300 of Dodge's rifles, and Howard's or Follett's artillery, with a section of Davis'. As soon as possible I will make a diversion above Smithfield. Spear left at 11 for Suffolk. See him as to details of proposed movement. I did not send for you because I did not wish you to leave Suffolk. Let me her from you.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, December 18, 1862.

Major-General DIX:

I think the movement proposed by you might now succeed, and unless otherwise directed by you will send out the expedition to-morrow.

You will get reports from me this afternoon of the last scouting parties.

O. S. FERRY,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, December 18, 1862.

Brigadier-General FERRY;

Let your expedition go to-morrow night. If there is time I will land a force in Burwell's Bay, above Smithfield, to-morrow night. Send me the West End at once. Let me know to-night if you can bet ready to-morrow night.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
