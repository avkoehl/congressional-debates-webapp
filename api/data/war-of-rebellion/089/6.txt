HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT, October 1, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following dispatch from the plank road station is respectfully forwarded:

"1.30 P. M.

"A body of infantry has just disappeared in the woods on the right and to the west of the large fort west of the Weldon railroad. They came from our left on the Weldon railroad, apparently from Warren's old front. The head of the column was not visible on account of the rain. Saw about 1,000 of the column; in its rear 400 or 500 stragglers followed."

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Copy to General Meade.)

CITY POINT, VA., October 1, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

The movements reported in General Crawford's front would indicate that the enemy had felt there this morning to see if they could strip that part of their line. Finding they could, they have re-enforced their right from there this evening. I think Crawford should be directed to push out in the morning directly down the railroad, leaving but a picket-line in his rear, and either make the enemy hold that part of his line strongly or go through. Hancock ought to do the same thing on his front.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Generals Parke and Warren are ordered to attack early to-morrow morning. General Crawford will watch the enemy in his front and take advantage of any opportunity that may present itself, in conformity with previous instructions, either to attack or maneuver so as to compel the enemy to keep a force in his front.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
