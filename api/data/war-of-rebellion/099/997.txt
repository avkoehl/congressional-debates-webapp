SPRINGFIELD, GA., January 6, 1865.

[Colonel M. W. HANNON:]

COLONEL: I have delayed dispatching to you until now (12 m.) for the purpose of getting, if possible, definite information as to the enemy's movements in this direction. I have no information of their advance on the right of this post except for forage and wood. In front and on the left (Augusta road) they made their appearance in small force, but scouts say they have returned, and that they, too, were only protecting wagons after forage, &amp;c. Captain Moncrief reports no Yankees on the right, this side of the canal. I have no information relative to a boat on the river. Have sent several scouts in that direction. Will let you know as son as they are heard from. The scouts that have reported here since my arrival have no idea the enemy is advancing except for purposes above stated. I will know definitely this afternoon and will let you know.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, &c.,

MADISON BELL,

Captain.

P. S. --Captain Moncrief was on the scout himself yesterday, and knew nothing of the dispatch sent you last night. He was in one mile of the canal, which is only nine miles from Savannah. Since writing the above Lieutenant Long has come in from the river road past Ebenezer, and says the enemy was shooting across the creek at that post yesterday, but that they returned last night.

M. BELL,

Captain.

RICHMOND, VA., January 7, 1865.

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Inform me of your position and plans, what re-enforcements you expect from Georgia and South Carolina. Conner's brigade, from Lee's army, is en route to aid you. Have you heard from Hood, as to sending troops to Augusta?

JEFF'N DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., January 7, 1865.

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

You will give special attention to the organization of the cavalry of your command, so as to promote discipline and efficiency, recommending specifically any action which you desire to be taken here. Battalions should, as far as consistent, be organized into regiments, and regiments into brigades of proper numerical strength, attention being given to the prospect of recovering absentees.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

CHARLESTON, January 7, 1865. (Received 5 o'clock.)

General S. COOPER:

We had information some days ago that the enemy were sending troops in transports down the river from Savannah. Confederate surgeons
