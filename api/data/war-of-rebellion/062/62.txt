Brigadier General DANIEL ULLMANN,Commanding at Port Hudson, La.:

Colonel Boardman just in from Redwood bridge. Stream high and rising. Enemy's pickets there. They were in some force southeast of me last night. I think there may not be 500 in all. But for high waters you could easily drive them out of the country. I shall only make patrols to-morrow. If you get important news of them please telegraph me.
