APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1841.
2fTH Cong.......1st Skss.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury—Mr. Woodbury.
Senate.
But" when we advert  next to the
estimated receipts for the next three
months, it  immediately   appears,
that those from customs are esti-
mated  below the Secretary's own         ^
average for the last ten months, of
1841, quite         "-           -           -        600,000
And the lands quite -           -           -          50,000
Correcting this error on his own data, and we
know that July is to be one of the laigest months
in this year for receipts from duties, in consequence
of the very large imports in January, on three and
six months' credit, and that very large quantities of
land are advertised to be sold in June, and the whole
estimated déficit has disappeared, and a balance
wonld be left in the Treasury of $63,426
If, from the circumstances just mentioned, the
receipts be increased near half a million higher,
which is probable for the three months from lands
and duties, and tbere be collected, as might be,
$150,000 more from banks, than is estimated m
these three months and the balance in the Treasury
on the 1st of September would be near three-fourths
of a million.
From another part of the report, it appears that
there would be in the Mint besides, which could be
used, if found necessary, $180,199, and we know
that the actual receipts at this date oa the first of
June, not then returned to (he Department, which
are afterwards returned, and can be ased, will be
usually $100 000 to $150 000 more, or enough to
make $300,000 These last items amount to nearly
at. mue.*< as ihe deficit of the Secretary exceeds  that
of (he President So Mat taking either as the cor-
rect ground ot calculation, tbere would, under
these expenditure* be no deficit whatever, but in
the President's aggregate, a balance en hand of
more than a mil ion ot dollars, and in the Secre-
tary's of near tnree fourths of a million
To be sure, a  beiore intimated, this balance can
be prevented from accruing, if the Executive De-
partment, ird those under them, push expenditures
fa-ler then is usual or legitin ale, and ihey proba-
bly havo been pushed so, during the Ja&t three
months, or if we authorize at this session ihe
new expenditures desired by means of new ap-
propriations. But such a result as a deficit of
five or six millions is otherwise not likely and
hardly possible by ibe first of September, unless
* the receipts are kept down below what is natural
by not advertising lands for sale, or by further
measures, checking still more our foreign com-
merce and destroying what is left, since the United
Stales Bank explosion, of our foreign credit. In-
deed, the teceipts for the next three months, as
well as for the year, have been estimated by me
but a little higher than by the Secretary himself
That little I think he ought in only ordinary libera-
lity to concede, under ail the circumstances.
Thus'c omits near two hundred thousand do!-
lars interest due from banks, and about §80,000
due from the United Stales Bank. This last, it
seems, by an answer to our new call, is now to be
nullified by woe new account, trumped up unce the
4ih of March, and the restoration, I =uppo«e, of
new principles, whioh the Secretary, in another
place, dv¡ lis on with such complacency. He
may coWcct veüh r of these ¡f he pleases not to
to do hi. dniy But ihey are all due, and shoull
be estimated and collected, uniess Congress other-
wise direct .
He also est mates the receipts from customs
during the wh le year, nearly five millions less
than the rao^t intell gent merchants, co.leciors, and
subordinate oificsis mile Treasury did last De-

Some a'lowances were suggested m the innoal re-
port in December last, as proper to be made m
case of the banks not resuming, though san-
guine politicians professed lo believe that the
election alone of a new President would, at all
events, act like electricity on commerce, and swell
our business and revenue to the highest pitch.
One of ihetn, and no careless or circumscribed
observer, said:
"The fact of his election ( Wilha n Hem y Harrison') alone,
without reference to the measure* of his Administration,
will powerfully contribute to the security and happiness of
the people It will bring assurance of the cessation of that long
series of disastt ous experiments, which have so sreatty afflicted

rily — Speech of Henry Clay at Hanover, July 10,1£40
Similar political prophecies «/ere numerous But
the eleciion came, virtually, in November and De-
cember, but without any of the revival in prices
the publ c had previously been led to expect, and
none of the new impulses to commerce, from po-
litical events, which had been so confidently
dieted.
The increase of importations would have occur-
red in January, from the great laws of trade, who-
ever had been elected President, and it would have
been checked again in Febiuary, as it was, who-
ever was or was to be President, by tha same great
laws, violated as Ihey were through the conduct of
the United States Bank, spreading rum for a tiras
among many in great classes in both hemispheres
Disappointed by iheelec ion in its promised fruits,and
likely to be desecrated as false ptophew,H was next
wetended that n was necessary to have actual pes
se         of office in all Us ratifications before a
millemum these matters was lo be complete.
Then even Ihe sanguine hopes as to imports, che-
rished in December, would be exceeded. That,
loo, has come, offices innumerable have been seized
on as ihe spoils of victory, .md yet prices and bu-
siness ate somewhat obstinate about changing for
the better, and now ii is new measures, new legisla-
tion, which is to swell th  tide ot glory, .¿nd work
ihe great reform and revival. Wheie political
quackery is to end on these topics, remains
to be ¡seen; but as ihe measures ot relief
can now be adopted to any exten' desired,
as not only the election has been consum-
mated near half a year; ihe conquered trophies of
effice enjoyed for near a quarter of a year; all the
alleged leaks in the Treasury, it is to be presumed,
stopped, all defaults prevented,—and tho«e magical
Sibylline new books opened, which were to effec
such miracles in finance, 1 tb'nk the Secretary
might be a little more generous in respect to his es-
timate of receipts for the next thiee months, as well
as the re*t of the year The President is kind
enough to anticípale a revival of prosperity; though
omitting to increase the revenue any on account of
it, and the S'cretary should assuredly allow from
half a million to a million more in this year for re-
ceipts, it he bclrves a tithe ot the predictions of
those arounl him, as to the sudden and wondrous
increase of prices and business, whieh their mere
advent to power, and, beside this, their wise mea-
sure , v?ere to produce If this increase donot forth-
with come, it certainly will not be for the want of
political power to ri move any political objection?,
and for want of political nostrums m abundance to
cure all kinds of evils But it will lather be, be-
cause the United States Bink, like the dyirg whale
or levia'han, 1ms, m its death fluny, wounded or

par' of the country it must be that the gambling
speculations and gro^s over-trai'ingan! over-bank-
ing which have led to her ru.n, hav  been too de< p-
ly seated, too corrup u g, and too much intermingled
in the whole f ur uits of our people, either to have
b<=en caused by me polities cf one Piesident ten1 g
Demoeriue, or to be cured by those of anoihci be
mg Federal.
By Ihe tune of the next meeting of this body,
we «hall be ab'e to ee whether ihe present addi-
tional patent medienes now piopo.el ¡or relief of
ail kinds are successful, or aie to be followed by
some new political panacea, and the political miile
mum to come which is again and again postponed,
notwithstanding all the confident Wmg prophesies
to the contrary.
I have done with the expenditures and receipts—
with deficits and debts—-and next will advert to the
measures of relief proposed to get rid of any depo-
sits or debts, which the Secretary calculates to exist
in such inflated, exaggeratedamounts.
The General Government, the States, and the
people, are all represented by him and by the Pre-
sident lo be in a most suffering condition, and, not
contented to administer advice to the i auent
placed in their charge by the Constitution, viz the
General Government, they embrace m their bene-
volent plans all the disorders of the State Govern-
ments, and all the ills which flesh is heir to among
the people at large. Some brief views on their ex-
tended system of legis'a'mg for almost every body
and every thing—on the character and piopnety of
these extraordinary measures of relief, and I shall
relieve the Senate from any further attention to me
on this occasion.
The first prominent feature in the relief pro-
posed, is to magnify its extent and imporiance in
all possible ways, like many physicians, who
never attempt to cure the smallest scratch or slight-
est fetter, without seeking to persuade the patient
and his friends, that lock jaws, choleras, and all
other jjborrors, have been escaped by resortmg to
their skill and aid
The next is, when the General Government is
represented to be embarrassed, ard overloaded
with monstrous debts and deficits, to begin and
take lrom it three millions of us present resources.
Net to take frcm it a surplu —relieve it of an
incumbrance; bi-t while deoiluated, ps they say,
smuggling witn exhaustion, to bleed it three mill ons
more.
Not satisfied with tins, ihe next wise proposi-
tion is to take from it even nine millions more, and
to give it to those Stales who are at this moment in
debted to it over twenty-eight millions, and who,
so far from having any claim to this nine mil-
lions as a debt due, are bound in law and com-
mon honesty, and by their plighted faith, to pay us
back m this exigency the vhole oí thrt twenty-
eight millions. This g ting away of twelve mil-
lions by us, when represented to be much in debt,
that should be paid—this "new way of paying old
debts," is one so sagacious and protound, as
never to have oceuired to the editor of the farce
under that titie. It is left to the present Adminis-
tration as one of its glories, to have made the
great discovery
The ni xt unique or peculiar fearture m the mea-
sures proposed, is to grow rich by banking on bor-
rowed capital. This is the sovertign remedy, and
proposed and elaborated in supplemental reports
with much gravity, notwithstanding the monuments
of ruin now s'anding before us, from similar quack
expenmen s m Michigan, in. Mississippi, and, it is
to be feared, in several other States, and which
identical kind of effort to grow rich in a new way,
has brought on them most of the evils we are ad-
vised lo help remove by precisely the same kind of
hazardous and ruinous expenmen t.
Another feature runnm  through the whole of
these rare schemes i=, that we are to raise the
wind, not for one alone, but for the whole of them
at first, by means of the boasted modern crecit sys-
tem—not by any present surplus, for they pietend
there i  a deficiency—not by retaining all our pre-
sent r-venue" for many oí those they propose to
give away—not by reducing our expenditures, for
those they recommend to3increase, but by overload-
ing this already embarrassed Governmen*, as tbey
call it, and this already rumed people, as they pre-
tend, and all their posterity for age', witn an im-
mense, permanent, national debt, in a period of
profound peace vmh all foreign nauons.
Ye", one of the most stnKing elements in these
recommendations, not yet "olatged en, is, after de-
nouncing the past Administration as wasteful, with
expenso only twenty three millions last year, and
proposed to be not over twenty this year, and yet
profess to practise retrenchment and reform, by in-
creasing these expenses to twenty-s x millions, and
to relieve the public suffering by adding to the debt
millions on millious for the most dangerous and
reckless experiment m public banking that has oc-
curred since the Mississippi scheme of John Law,
more than a century ago.   If our new plans m
