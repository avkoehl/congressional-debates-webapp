Ohio [Mr. Cox] does too. 1 quote the words lit-
erally: " the United States are divided into four
sections, as follows." Who can constiue thai
language to mean anything else than that the Uni-
ted States shall be divided into four sections, as
therein provided ? I would like to see somebody
get. up and suggest a different meaning. The
words are plain, without the least ambiguity, "the
United States are divided into four sections, as fol-
lows." That the whole country may see and
judge the amendments thus proposed by_ my col-
league, I shall append them to my speech.* These,
sir, are the gentlemen who talk about the Union
as it was and the Constitution as it is. The Union
shall be divided into four sections; the section of
the North to consist of the New England States,
New York, Pennsylvania,and New Jersey; while
the section of the South was to consist of the fif-
teen skive States, one half the area of all the States
east of the Rocky mountains, and more than
three times tin; area ofihe empire of France. And
vet these gentlemen talk to me about sectionalism !
'A nioposnion like that was enough todisturo the
lepose ofihe dead Father of om Country.

have oniy said that that side of the House uttered
no word of denunciation against it.
Mr. COX. "Well, then, what does he mean ?
Now, I say to the gentleman that I do not hold
him responsible for a proposition that camc from
a gentleman on that side of the House during the
session of 1861, which proposed to allow these
States to go out of the Union, although the gen-
tleman afterwards voted for the very man who
made that proposition for Lieutenant Governor
of the Stale of Ohio.
Mr. BINGHAM. Who is that?
Mr. COX. Mr. Stanton.
Mr. BINGHAM. 1 do not think he madeany
such proposition as that.
Mr. COX. [ can piove it from the Globe.
Mr. BINGHAM. 31c may have made such a
speech,but never offered such a proposition; but
my colleague cannot divert me in that way, and
he may ptst as wr'l ^ive it m>.
Mr. COX. 1 think it is very diverting to see
my colic go on in this way.

previous question until I should reply to him. -He
knows that, and he knows, also, that I recorded
my vote against the measure which he advocated,
and which, with the aid of'my colleague's vote,
[Mr. Cox,] passed. He knows that before Mr.
Stanton uttered any such words, 1 had excluded
any conclusion that I was favorable to any such
suggestion.
Air. COX. "But I want to know if the gentle-
man did hot vote for Mr. Stanton for Lieutenant
Governor afterwards?
Mr. BINGHAM. The point I make is that
gentlemen on the other side of the House sat here
silent, and allowed the proposition of ray colleague
[Mr. Valx^ndioham] to be introduced, and said
nothing against it; and yet they talk now about
being for " the Union as it was, and for the Con-
stitution as it is." The United States were to be
divided into four sections, the eastern section to
comprise the New England States, New York,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; the western sec-
tion to eon&ist of the fiee States between the Rocky
mountains and the Alleghanies; the Pacific sec-
tion to consist of the States west of the Rocky
mountains; and the southern section to consist of
all the slavehokling States.
Mr. YEAMAN. Will the gentleman yield to
me for a moment?
Mr. HINGIJAM. I will, sir.
Mr. YEAMAN. I understand his argument
to be that there was onee a party in this House—
I was not here then—who made themselves in-
consistent; that they now say they arc for the
Constitution as it is, whereas they wore once for
the amendment of that Constitution. I desire to
know of the gentleman if he has forgotten that
that Constitution contains an express provision
by which it can be amended ? ♦
Mr. 3UNGIIAM. I was perfectly asvarc of
that fact; but, at the same tune, it does not con-
tain a provision by which it can rightfully be
destroyed.
Mr. YEAMAN. Oh, no.
Mr. I3INGHAM. Well, that is the point I am
nt now. This was a proposition to destroy the
Constitution under tho pretense of amending it,
and there is no dodging the fact.
Mr. YEAMAN. 'It was a proposition to amend
the Constitution.
Mr. 1HNGI1AM. No, sir; it was a proposi-
tion to destioy the Union and to destroy the Con-
stitution. I speak ofthe legal effect of the pro-
vision.
Mi. PENDLETON. Will my colleague allow
mc a single question?
Mr. IliNGHAM. Yes, sir.
Mr. PENDLETON. Will you go on and state
to the House for what purpose it was that this di-
vision of the Union was to be made into sections,
whether for the purpose of dismembering the
Union, or for tiie purpose, in certain contingencies,
!; on the demand ofacertaiu numberofSenators and
\ Representatives, to tequiie concunent votes of the
j! Representatives and Senators from those sections.
|j Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I am sur-
|; prised that a gentleman so astute as my colleague
!, should ask mc to define the purpose for which
any gentleman mtioduccd a measure.
ij Mr. PENDLETON. I simply ask you to give
j! a definition of its provisions, which you have not
|; done,
!! Mr. BINGHAM. I say the effect of the bill
was to dismembui the Union. I shall show this
vet y clearly piesently ; and shall also append the
Amendments proposed to ray speech in full, that
the people may knew what was their effect.
;; Mr. PENDLETON. No, sir, you are mis-
: tiiknn,
Mr. iHNGUAM. 1 say the bill stated on its
i1 face that these United States were to be dividedlnto
. four sections; Unit it legalized secession, and that
the wfuot of if was to destroy the Government. I
do not say what the purpose was; that was the
effect.
\ Mr. PENDLETON. I desire to ask my col-
league further, if there was not an express prohi-
bition of secession in the amendments proposed
by my colleague ?
'Mr. BINGIIAM. No, sir.
Mr. PENDLETON. Yes, sir.
Mr. BINGHAM. There was an express pro-
vision lor secession in the amendments—a pro-
' vision that no State should secede without the con-
ii sent of the Legislatures of all the States of the
