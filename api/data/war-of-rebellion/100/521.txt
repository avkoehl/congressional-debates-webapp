Major-General KILPATRICK,

Lexington:

I wrote you yesterday concerning the gold found at the Campany's Shops. You may defer the action directed in that letter for the present. I think it will be wiser to take another course. Captain Brink says he has about $2,000 of the money in his trunk at Lexington. Take possession of and hold it until the matter is investigated. Answer.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, May 17, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch has been received regarding gold, but not your communication.

Brevet Major-General.
