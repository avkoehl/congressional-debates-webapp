Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Wright,
25th ConG""2nd Sess,
abridge it as much as justice to the measure would
permit
As appluable to the first object, the bill com-
menced with the establishment of offices and vaults,
at designated points, for the safe keeping of the
public money The first section defined and esta-
blished the Treasury of the United States, and
placed it undei the care and charge of the Trea-
surer of the United States, and, singular as it haá
appeared to him, and as he thought it would ap-
pear to rpost of the constituents of every Senator,
this-was the first attempt, so far as his researches
had enabled him to discover, to establish by law a
National Treasury Should this bill pass, and
this section be retained, he was confident it would
be the first act of the Congress of the United States
which had given, not a name, but " a local habita-
tion," to this most important institution As the
object of the bill is to place the funds of the Go-
vernment hereafter under the control ot the pub-
lic Treasuiy, and not of private banking instituí
tions, it seemed to the committee peculiarly proper
that its first enactment should be to define and eUa
lish that Tieaaury
The second section constituted the mmtat Phila-
delphia, and the blanch mint at New Orleans, also
places for the deposite and safe keeping of the pub-
lic money collected at those places, or transferred
to them by the direction of the Secretary of the
Treasmv The treasurers of the mints respectively
were assigned to the charge and custody of the
monej s there deposited.
The third section directed the preparation of
suitable offices and vaults m the custom houses
now erecting at New York and Boston, for the de
posite and aft- keeping of the public money at
tno=e pom!", and kr the use of the officers to have
the custody of those moneys and the fourth sec-
tion piovidrd for the erection of two indepen-
dent c dices and \ anils, for the same purpose the
one to be located at Charleston, in the S ate of
South Carolina, and the other at St Louis, m the
S'ate of Missouri
It would not require any remark from him to
satisfy the mind of every Senator of the propriety
of selecting the seat of Government as the place of
location for the National Treasury, or 'nat the
points he had named upon the Atlantic coast, as
well as New Orleans, were places where so impor-
tant portions of tr-> public levenue were collected,
and from w inch so great a 'hare ot the public dis-
bursements were now, m fact, made, or could be
nade wi h incieised convenience to the Treasury,
and to the public creditors, as to render them all
proper places for the loca'ion of offices for the safe-
keeping of the public monev,m case any such offices
were to be provided at the public expense, o*n-
ed bv the Government, and kept in tl.e charge of
its officers Another reason also e tisted, and which
was'conclusive with the committee, as to he re-
ject on of Wa-^h ngton, Plulade'phia, New Orleans,
New Yc k and B jston Public baildmgs of a fire
proof u aiacter were a'ready elected, 01 now be
mg e ccted, at the public expense, and k r tne pub
lie use, at all those places, in which sufi cient rooms,
offices and wjl s, for tne purpose contemplated,
cou d be sec n d without any material addition to
the expense incurred, and to be incurred, upon the
buildings It was aKo his duty to inform the Se-
nate tnat, «mce the bill was rep< rt=d, the committee
had learned thit the Government now owned a
cust )m--ouse a1 O anesto i, and thit tne informa-
tion poses d at the Tieasury Departmen* autho-
rized the btl ef thit -,u tihle roii^s for oil "<>s could

den' offiT ps t ¡e tthcoitemplated, at thit phce
Hehidpr pned an amendmert to the bill, to
make it conform 11 this state of fief, wheh he
would send to the Chan before he resumed his seat
As to the select on of St Louis some d  ersity of
opinion might exist, but the committee had fixed
Tipon that p'ace, because, fiom all the information
they had been able to collect, they believed it to be
the point from wh ch the principal pai t of our hea-
vy disbursements upon the western frontier were
made They weie informed that a very large pro-
portion, of the money paid, and to be paid, annually,
to the Indians westot the Mississippi, and the pn -
cipal part of the dtubuisemeats at the various mili-
tary posts upon the western frontier, were received
by the various disbursing officers at this town, and
that, therefore, large accumulations of public mo-
ney were rendered necessary at this point, to meet
lhe<« pajmenk This seemed to them to require
an office tor oafe-keeping, and an officer or agent
of the Government, ot some kmd, there, and the
place was selected more, perhaps, in consequence
of the heavy disbursements made from, than the
amount of collections at it Still their information
was, that the money collected at many of the west-
ern, and especially the northwestern, land offices
could be more conveniently transferred to, and ac-
cumulated at, that point than at any other upon
that frontier
Ths fifth section of the bill, he said, provided for
the appointment of four additional salary of-
ficers, and which, m the draft of the bill, the com-
mittee had, to distinguish them from the receivers
of public money at the various land offices, de-
nominated "receivers geneial of public money "
These officers w ere to be appointed by the Presi-
dent, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, as other officers of like impoitance were
appointed, weie to hold their offices for the same
termsof four years, and were to be located, one at
New York, one at Boston, one at Charleston, and
one at St Louis, to lake the charge of the offices
and vaults for the safe-keeping of the public money
at those points respectively, and of the money
placed therein
He was well-aware that this was a feature of the
bill rot calculated to be popular, upon a slight ex-
amination, and that it was not palatable to some of
the friends of the measure generally It was not
his purpose to d^mss this provision at large, in
this place, as the course he had marked out for
himself would require that he should again recur to
i, but a few remarks upon the necessity of some
prov ision of the sort were called foi here It was
indispensably necessary to the operations of the
Treasury, that it should ha\ e agencies of some de-
scription at these pomfe The collections and dis-
bursements at them all made this imperative, and
if it was designed to discontinue the banks as
fiscal agents, some other must be substituted This
would be apparent to all, merely from recurring to
the names of the places, and to their importance as
commercial towns It was true that, m the
bill reported by the committee, at the extra
session of Congress in September, no provision
as as made for this addition to the existing officers
of the Treasury Department The duties now
proposed to be assigned to these new officers, were,
by that bill, devolved upon the respective collec-
tors o<" the customs at the places named, but it was
then stated to the Senate by himself, m his place, that
this and many other matters of detail were purposely
omitted, that the bill then reported might be made
as simple as possible, and embody the great princi-
ples intended to be secured by it, knowing, as the
comn íttee did know, the strong desire and deter-
mination of bo'h Houses of Congress to limit that
session within the shortest possible period which
the public busme s would allow They believed
that these detai's, mc'udmg as well the provisions
of the sections before noticed, as the one now
under discussion, and others which follow, would
be calculated to piotiact discussion, delay action,
and thus, either extend the session, or pievent the
final passage of the bill They were thei con
vinced that the recommendations of the President
and Secretary of the Treasury, as to the appoint-
ment of these additional officers, would have to be
carried out, but, in the then almost suspended
state of our foreign trade, they did not believe that
the operations ot theTreisui} would suffer for the
want oí them during the very snort vacation which
was to intervene between tnat and the present ses-
sion cf Congress, and it was then intimated thit the
defects in that bill could be supplied new
The inquiries which the comm ttee have since
made, pot only at the Treasurj Department, but ai
some of the places named, have proved to their en-
tire satisfaction that this addition of officers will be
r^qu red, that the col'ectors of the customs at these
places, or certainly at some of them, are already
charged with more onerous and responsible duties
than an/ one mm, whatever may be his industry
and capicuj foi buHn" s, can v ell dischaige, and
Senate.
that, at the port of New York at least, those duties
would justly bear division, were it not ftet, from
theix nature and character, they cannot be divided.
The same must be nearly the truth at Boston, and
cannot vary very materially from it at Charlesten
and St. Loins The Secretary of the Treasurer
supposes that the receipts and distntráeíttents of the
money ordinarily collected and djsfct0§eftwf>each of
these points, will occupy the full time'-of one com-
petent business man, and will any one suppose that
duties so onerous and so responsible can be added
to those at present to be performed by the collectors
of the customs'! Will any one desire that such du-
ties and responsibilities should be confided to a
mere clerk in the office of the collector'' He thought
not Then the provision, or 'ome ons of a similar
character, wa  indispensable, and its rejection
would endanger the safely of the public money, em-
barrass tne operations of the Treasury, and put in
jeopardy, if not defeat, the successful action of the
whole sj'stem.
The sixth section of the bill was, m substance,
the first section of the bill reported by the commit-
tee at the extra session, the only alterations being
those requ red to make it conform to the provisions
which were before it, and which he had already no-
ticed It declared what officers of the Government
sho rid be depositaries, embracing, in addition to
those named in the former sections, collectors of
the customs, receivers of public money at the land
offices, postmasters, and some other classes, and
assigned generally the duties to be performed by
them mthis capacity.
He would now pass to section ten, which requir-
ed but a single remark It conferred a general
power upon the Secretary of the Treasury to trans-
fer the money in the hands of any depositary to the
custody and keeping of any other depositary, as
occasion might require This provision was neces-
sary , as well to give the Department control over
its own affairs, as to enable it to consult the safety
of the public money, and the calls of the public
serv ice If money accumulate, at any given point,
to an amount which, fiom the smallness of the offi-
cer's bond, or from any other cause, the Secretary
shall have reason to fear is, or may be, unsafe, he
should be authorized to transfer it, or any portion
of it, to a place of safety If money accumulate at
points where it is not wanted for disbursement, he
should have the same authority to transfer it to a
print where it is so wanted If a depositary be lo-
cated at a place remote from any bank, and any
office of safe-keeping, similar authority will be re-
quired to transfer hi« collections for deposite.
These, and many other occasions, will arise for the
exercise of this power to make transfers
The twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth sections
contained provision  to authorize special deposites
of public money for safe-keepmg, at all places
where there was no office for the safe-keeping be-
longing to the Government Tne only parts of the
sections which it would be material for him to no-
tice, were those which defined the character of the
deposites They are made strictly special, and a
broad discretion is given to the Secretary of the
Treasury as to the measures he will adopt to secure
to them that character In ca e he shall think it
wise to do so, he is authorized to provide iron
safes to be placed in the vaults of the banks, for
the exclusive keeping of the public money, and s 
constructed that they may be under the joint con-
trol of the bmk and the depositing officer, so that
neither can gam access to the money without the
con¡>°nt a id aid of the other A further condition
is, that nothing but gold and silver, and paper
issued upon the authority of the United States, and
made, by law, receivable in payment of the public
dues, shall be offered ¡or deposite by the deposita-
ries, 01 received on deposite by the banks It is
further provided, that all deposites shall be carried
upon the book  of the bank to the credit of the offi-
cer making the deposite, and not to the credit of the
Treasurer of the United States, that neither the
Treasurer, nor the Secretary of the Treasury, shall
draw upon the bank for disbursements or transfers
and that the money deposited shall not be with
drawn from the bank, by the officer to w4ios<
credit it stands, without an order from the Secreta
tary of the Treasury for the payment. A commis
