thought we were granting nothing more than the
settler's upon the mineral lands were entitled to.
I do not know that there are any other essential
changes. If gentlemen wish information upon
any other point I will gladly give it.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Will the
gentleman have the report printed so that we may
know what it is ?
Mr. STEVENS. I do not know when a ma-
jority of the House will be found here again. I
think it is explained to the House fairly, and
when they look at the bill I think they will find
no material changes beyond what I have men-
tioned, and that all the changes which have been
made are in derogation of the rights granted to
the company. In other words, they are all in
favor of the United States.
I call the previous question upon agreeing to
the report.
Mr. WILSON demanded tellers on seconding
the previous question.
Tellers were ordered; and Mr. Wasiiburne, of
Illinois, and Mr. Stevens were appointed.
The House divided; and the tellers reportedâ€”
ayes 80, noes 13.
So the previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, demanded
the yeas and nays on agreeing to the report, and
tellers upon the yeas and nays.
Tellers were not ordered, and the yeas and nays
were not ordered.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois, demanded
tellers on agreeing to the report.
Tellers were not ordered.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS moved to reconsider the vote
by which the conference report was adopted; and
also moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
WASHINGTON AQUEDUCT.
Mr. STEVENS. I ask leave to introduce a
joint lesolution. If I am allowed, I may say a
word or two before introducing it. The House
had agreed to appropriate $150,000 under circum-
stances such as I need not repeat for the purpose
of bringing the water from the Potomac into this
city. The House confined the appropriation to
a specific object so that the money should not be
spent on the general work of the aqueduct, but
should effect a certain purpose. The Senate re-
fused to agree to it, and required that the money
should be left to be spent in any way the super-
intendent pleased. The confeience committee on
the part of the House refused to agree to that;
and so the whole appropiiatjon was struck out.
Since that has been done both Houses have been
informed that unless some appropriation of this
kind be made there cannot be any waterbrought
into the city. Nov/ I desire to have sent to the
Senate a joint resolution reaffirming the appro-
priation that we made in the very same way and
throwing upon the Senate the responsibility of
rejecting,' it.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The House
has just voted away $96,000,000 of the public
treasure, without even a vote by yeas and nays.
I object.
The SPEAKER. The joint resolution is not
before the House.
Mr. MQCRHEAD. 1 appeal to the gentleman
fiom Illinois to withdraw his objection.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Iinsistupon
my objection; we have drank muddy water heie
for ten years, and we can do so a little longer.
Mr. COX. I move that the House do now
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to: and thereupon (at
a quarter to eleven o'clock, p. m.) the House
adjourned.
