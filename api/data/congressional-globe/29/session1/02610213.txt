! made and agreed to) the House resolved itself into
1 Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
! Mr. Tihuatts, of Kentucky, in the chair,
i CONVENTION WITH PERU.
â–  Mr. C. J. INGERSOLL rose and said, that, as
1 the gentleman who was entitled to the floor [Mr.
RocifU'F.f.i.) had consented to yield it for the pur-
, pose, he (Mr. f.) would ask the committee to take
up the bill which he had yesterday reported from
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to carry mto
effect the convention between the United States
and the Republic of Peru.
The CHAIRMAN said that the bill could only
be taken up by unanimous consent, or by a post-
ponement of the subject last under consideia-
tion.
Mr. C. J. INGERSOLL said, he supposed that
no objection would be made. A large sum of
money was payable to the merchants of the North
under this convention, and the bill merely provided
that the moneys paid into the treasury by the Re-
public of Peru should be drawn out and paid over
to those to whom it was due.
The bill not being at the moment at hand, the
motion of Mr. Ixgersoll was not pressed.
OREGON.
So the committee resumed the consideration of
the joint resolution of notice, and of the amend-
ments thereto pending.
Mr. JOHN A. ROCKWELL was entitled to the
floor, and addressed the committee during the hour,
in a speech which is in the course of preparation.
After alluding to the importance of the question,
he directed his attention to the following points:
to the interest which his constituents had in its
result; to the number of ships sent out to the Pa-
cific ocean from the district he represented; to the
\rast amount of cnpital invested, ift shipping at the
ports of New London and Stonington, all of which
was, in case of war, to be exposed to entire de-
struction.
M r. R. proceeded to refer to a petition which
had been sent to him from New London, signed
by men of all parties, asking Congress to adopt
peaceable measures for the settlement of difficul-
ties, existing or apprehended, between the United
States and Great Britain. And he read an extract
from a letter from another port, showing the de-
structiv e effects upon that section of country of a
hostile collision; but declaring that if war must
come, the people there would be, found as ready to
defend the country as other citizens in Congress,
who boasted so loudly about shedding the last drop
of their blood.
[Mr. ANDREW JOHNSON and others ex-
pressed the hope that the fact might prove to be
so.]
Mr. ROCKWELL said that the people of that
section were not a timid people; and that he could
refer to the history recently published by a dis-
tinguished gentleman [Mr. Charles J. Ingersoll]
near him, to show what they had done m time of
trial.
All parties in this House (Mr. R. said) seemed
to desire peace. Thcie was no diversity of opin-
ion on that point. All gentlemen, or nearly all,
agreed that the notice was desirable, in order that
we might have peace; and those who opposed the
notice "did so, tliey said, that we might not have
war. 1 n addition to this, there had been a univer-
sal declaration of patriotism on the part of gentle-
men who had spoken. They all seemed to con-
sider it necessary to declare how patriotic they
were, and how ready, if war should come, to shed
their last drop of blood in the cause. These were
very harmless declarations, since the probability
was, that whatever blood wa3 to be shed, would
come from the veins of others, notofthem. They
might do the talking, others would do the fight-
ing.
As to the claim of the United States to this ter-
ritory, he did not think it was either necessary or
desirable for him to go into its discussion. His
own idea was, that our claim was the best. None
of us were disposed, however, to make a claim
against our own country, where another country
was concemod. On the contrary, it was natural
that we should be disposed to make the best of our
own. He accorded the praise that was claimed
for the. Secretary of State in his exposition of the
justice of our claim, and expressed his own strong
confidencc in the character of that claim.
He rejoiced to find that this was not made a
party question. He would deeply regret to see a
question affecting so deeply the interests of this
nation, not only for the present, but for all future
tunc., decided on party considerations.
It had been said, in the course of a former dis-
cussion, that our true policy was " a wise and
masterly inactivity." It was a happy remark,
made, he believed, at an earlier period by John
Randolph, and before him, he believed, by Burke.
For his (Mr. R.'s) part, he not only thought the
remark a happy one, but he believed that at the
time it was made it was the true policy of our
country. He did not believe, however, that it was
any longer so, and he could not but think that the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs
was rather inconsistent when, in the same breath
in which he advocated the policy of sending our
people there that they might increase and multi-
ply as fast as possible, he declared himself in fa-
vor of a course of proceeding which could not fail
to put a stop to that state of things. Mr. R.
thought that the time for that " wise and masterly
inactivity" had passed. He thought it apparent
that we could no longer pursue that course ; that
we could not now leave the question where it stood,
or postpone its decision indefinitely, that our peo-
