Major-General DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis:

Your dispatch is received. I shall do everything in my power with the troops under my command to prevent any bands of guerrillas getting through the district. The citizens here also seem to do all they can to destroy and cause the destruction of these bands. I am very much in need of horse equipments. My ordnance officer made a requisition for 500 sets by telegraph some days since, and I hope they will be received soon.
