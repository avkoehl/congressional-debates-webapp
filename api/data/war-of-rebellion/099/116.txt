Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Some time since orders were sent to General Thomas to forward to Savannah, via New York, all fractions of regiments, &amp;c., belonging to the corps under General Sherman. General Meagher telegraphs to-day from Pittsburg that he has 7,000 men and wants transports ready in New York, but General Van Vliet says that he cannot furnish them if he sends transports here to meet Schofield's corps.
