raised, for some reason or other, perhaps from
the persistency and zeal of the distinguished
Senator from Oregon who is on the Indian
Committee; but I do hope the Senate will not
acquiesce in any such policy on behalf of any
particular class of Indians, or Indians in any
particularportion of the country,as isattempted
in reference to the Indians in Oregon. I have
not asked for an increase of the appropriations
for the Indians in California. I would not do
it. I would rather reduce them. The appro-
priations are very small indeed; but I have not
asked that they be raised, though the Depart-
ment have recommended the raising of the
appropriations for that State. I hope the Sen-
ator from Oregon will not take any such advan-
tage or attempt to raise the appropriations for
the Indians in his particular Stale because he
happens to be ou the Indian Committee,where
he can use the position he has for any such
purpose.
Mr. CORBETT. I think the Senator from
California is very ungenerous in making such a
statement to the Senate. I remember, about
a year ago or so, that the Senator from Cali-
fornia ou the Appropriation Committee raised
the appropriations for the California Indians
I think something like twenty or twenty-five
thousand dollars. I might make the same sug-
gestion with regard to the Indians in Cali-
fornia that he has made with regard to the
Indians in Oregon.
Mr. COLE. I must correct the Senator.
He is entirely mistaken. I never did a thing
of the sort.
Mr. CORBETT. I am quite positive such
is the case.
Mr. COLE. The Senator may be positive
in his own mind, hut he is in error.
Mr. CORBETT. I do not see why, because
I happen to be on the committee on Indian
Affairs, I should neglect the interest of the
Indians in Oregon. This is for the maintenance
of a manual-labor school, and I submit to the
Senate that $2,000 will not maintain a manual-
labor school. How many children can you
support in a manual-labor school for $2,000 a
year? I say that 83,000 is as little as can
safely be voted. You have got to employ a
teacher, and when you take out the pay of a
teacher how many children are you going to
support in a manual-labor school for $1,000?
It is only necessary to make a statement of
the case that the Senate may vote upon it
understanding^. The question is whether we
shall appropriate $8,000 or $2,000 for the
support of this manual-labor school.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment
is to increase the amount in this item, as sent
from the House of Representatives, from
$2,000 to $3,000.
The amendment was rejected.
The VICE PRESIDEN T. The Secretary
will report the next amendment.
The Chief Cleuk. On page 34 the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, struck out
"twenty" and inserted "ten;" so^ as to
read, "for insurance and transportation of
goods, $10,000."
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is for the
Navajoes.
Mr. HARLAN. These Indians are a long
distance from any railroad, and transportation
is very expensive. I do not think $10,000
will cover the cost. I would suggest, how-
ever, that we modify the proposed amend-
ment and make the amount $15,000.
Mr. COLE. I can hardly resist any propo-
sition to reduce the bill. I think $10,000
would be ample for this purpose.
Mr. HARLAN. The honorable Senator
should remember that these Indians have been
removed from their old homes on the Picos
river and are now in the mountains of New
Mexico, a very great distance from any rail-
road, and transportation to them is very diffi-
cult and costly. The Commissioner of Indian
Affairs thought he would be unable to effect
it for less than $20,000 ; but on looking over
the amount of appropriations in the bill to be
expended, I think he can do it for less than
$20,000. I propose $15,000.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amount fixed
by the House of Representatives is $20,000.
In Committee of the Whole it was reduced, on
the motion of the Committee on Appropria-
tions, to $10,000. On the question of concur-
ring, the Senator from Iowa moves to amend
by inserting $15,000 instead of $10,000.
Mr. NYE. I ask the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs what amount it costs
to insure.
Mr. HARLAN. I do not know the rates of
insurance. I once knew, but I do not now
remember them.
Mr. NYE. Strike out the insurance and
you can carry the goods for this amount. I
am opposed to the Government paying pre-
miums to insurance companies.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the amendment of the Senator from Iowa
to the amendment of the Committee of the
Whole in regard to the amount.
The amendment to the amendment was
agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question
recurs on concurring in the amendment as
amended, which is to strike out "$20,000"
and insert " ยง15,000."
The amendment to the amendment was con-
curred in.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the next amendment.
The Chief Clerk. The next amendment is
on page 36 of the bill. The Committee on
Indian Affairs propose to strike out, in line
eight hundred and sixty, "$6,700" and to insert
"$T,600;" so as to read :
For salary of two matrons to take charge of the
boarding schools, two assistant teachers, one farmer,
one carpenter, and two millers, $7,600,
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is for the
Nez Perce Indians.
Mr. HARLAN. The Commissioner of In-
dian Affairs says that these words have become
reversed by inadvertence, that the item should
read "$7,600" instead of "$6,700."
Mr. COLE. It is unfavorable to the Gov-
ernment to correct such a mistake as that.
This increases the amount $900. I do not
think there was any mistake in the House of
Representatives in putting the amount at
$6,700.
Mr. IIARLAN. How is it in the estimates?
Mr. COLE. I am just looking for it.
Mr. CORBETT. It is $7,600 in the esti-
mates. A mistake was made last year in
transposing the figures, and it ought to be
$7,600. It was so in the estimates.
Mr. COLE. I>< the estimates it is "for sal-
ary of ten matrons." The House have put it
at two matrons.
Mr. CORBETT, This was a mistake in the
figures.
Mr. COLE. It is not a mistake m the
figures, I think.
Mr. CORBETT. It is a mistake m the
printing.
Mr. COLE. This change from ' ten to
"two" may have been the reason why they
reduced the amount from what it was in the
estimates to the amount in the bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to agreeing to this amendment? The
Chair hears no objection, and the amendment
is agreed to. The Secretary will report the
next amendment.
The Chief Clerk read the next amendment,
which was on page 39, line nine hundred and
forty-one, to insert after the word "regula-
tions" the words "and on such proofs; and
in line nine hundred and forty-three, to insett
after the word "enter" the words "without
cost;" and to strike out in lines nine hundred
and forty four and nine hundred and forty-five
the words "at $1 25 per acre;" so as to read:
Provided, That each half-breed or mixed-blood of
the Osages, being twenty-one years ot age, or the
head of a family, shall, under such rules and regula-
tions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the
Interior, be entitled to enterwit.hout cost, within th<i
diminished reservation of the Osage Indians in Kan-
sas, a tract of land in compact iorin and by legal
subdivisions, not exceeding one hundred and sixts
acrcs, &c.
Mr.POMEROY. My attention has just been
called to this. It looks to me as if it was an
effort on the part of some half-breed Osages
to get some improvements away from the set-
tlers. Settlers may have gone on and improved
some of this land since the act of Congress of
last year, and now a half-breed Osage or some
man belonging to the tribe may go back there
and locate for the sake of getting those im-
provements.
Mr. HARLAN. The honorable Senator's
suggestion would apply to the whole clause,
and not to the amendment proposed by the
Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr. POMEROY. It is the whole clause that
I was talking about.
Mr. HARLAN. The Senator has no objec-
tion, I apprehend, to the amendment.
Mr. POMEROY. No, not to the amend-
ment; that is better than the clause without
the amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection the amendnjent will be regarded as
agreed to. The Senator from Kansas, if he
desires, can afterward move to strike out the
proviso as amended.
Mr. POMEROY. I will let it go on now,
and reserve it until hereafter.
Mr. COLE. I think we had better dispose
of it. We might have some explanation on
the part of the Committee on Indian Affairs
who propose the amendment.
Mr. POMEROY. When the Committee on
Indian Affairs get through, I will then see if
I can get the sense of the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be in
order at that time to move to strike it out.
Mr. POMEROY. I have not studied it yet,
but it looks to me like an effort of some half-
breed Osage to get the improvements and the
laud from the settlers in my State.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will report the next amendment.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Indiau Affairs was to insert after line nine
hundred and fifty-six "for the purpose of
providing subsistence and clothing, and aiding
said Indians in establishing themselves in their
new homes, $50,000, to be reimbursed to the
United States from the proceeds of the sales
of the lands of the said Indians in Kansas."
Mr. IIARLAN. Perhaps a wordofexplan-
ation is necessary in this case. Senators will
remember that last year a clause was put in the
appropriation bill providing that, when the
Osage Indians should agree to it, their lands
in Kansas should be certified and sold for their
benefit, at not less than SI 25 an acre, and that
they should be furnished homes in the Indian
country at a cost not exceeding the cost thereof
to the United States. The Indians have been
removed and settled on the east side ot the
Arkansas river; a district of country has been
set off to them, and they are now attempting
to make some improvement at their new homes,
and this appropriation is intended merely to
anticipate the proceeds of the sale of their
lands in Kansas. A sufficient amount has
not yet come in applicable to this purpose to
enable them to go on with their improve-
ments. I suppose that no one will object to it.
Mr. COLE. This seems to be a very large
appropriation for what I presume to be a very
small band of Indians.
Mr. HARLAN. They estimate their own
number at forty-live hundred.
Mr. COLE. I do not know the condition
of these Indians, whether they are half-civ- โข
ilized or more than half-civilized or less ; but
I notice that in toimer appropriations for
some years the nmouut annually appropriated
for their benefit has been about fifteen thou-
sand dollars, sud I conclude from that that
