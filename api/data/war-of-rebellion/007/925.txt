WASHINGTON, December 5, 1861.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL:

I have again telegraphed Major-General Halleck for information as to his gunboats and disposable troops. As soon as I receive reply will arrange details with you. Send me draught of water in Cumberland River to Nashville and in Tennessee River. Your letter of 30th received.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, Lebanon, Ky., December 16, 1861.

Brigadier-General BUELL:

Commanding Department of the Ohio, Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-Colonel Letcher, First Kentucky Cavalry, reached this place to-day, with five companies of his regiment, on his way to Piketon. The additional company ordered by you yesterday will probably reach here to-morrow. I have directed Colonel Letcher to take 80 rounds per man, which will be enough until his supplies reach him form your headquarters. I find it a difficult matter to keep the troops at Somerset and Columbia supplied from this department with the limited means of transportation at my command. neither Colonel Dudley's nor Colonel Hobson's regiments have wagons, and the eighteenth Infantry and Colonel Barnes' regiment are also without wagons. We have very few wagons for the brigade and division trains, and although requisitions have been made frequently none have been received. It is absolutely necessary that we should have them as soon as possible.

I have 4 prisoners in camp: 3 of them are Confederate soldiers; the other is a Dr. Jackson, who shot the soldier of the Minnesota regiment on last Friday night. From the report made by the men I am inclined to think the shooting was entirely unprovoked, and the prisoner, from his avowed secession sentiments, should be kept in confinement in some one of the military prisons.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,GEO. H. THOMAS,

Brigadier-General U. S. Volunteers.
