NEW ORLEANS, LA., September 29, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Richmond, Va.:

I seized pork against your advice. Will release if not wanted. Generals not arrived. Have not arms for volunteers in camp. Have you any? What am I do to? Answer.

THO. O. MOORE.

RICHMOND, VA., September 30, 1861.

Gov. THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans, La.:

I can conceive no possible reason for seizing pork and cannot approve it. There is an abundance of food in our country, and private rights ought not to be invaded except in cases of necessity for public defense.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, September 30, 1861.

General DAVID E. TWIGGS,

New Orleans:

Do not accept the Mississippi troops for less than twelve months, unless they are simply for local defense, under law passed last session. Captain Hollins was only ordered to turn over to you a single rifled gun as a model for rifling other guns at the founder. If he refuses this, let me know. Terry has already been ordered to join General Johnston with his regiment. Do as you please about assigning Higgins to ordnance duty. It is said here that young Palfrey, recommended by you for your staff, is not twenty-one years old. If this is so he cannot be appointed an officer in the Army.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., September 30, 1861.

Gov. THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans, La.:

Your several dispatches about arms and generals received. Pray have a little patience. I am doing the best I can with the means at my disposal, and you do not allow me time to concert the arrangements necessary to satisfy you. In two or three days I will inform you fully of what is to be done.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.
