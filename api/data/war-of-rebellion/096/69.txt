MOREHEAD CITY, N. C., January 8, 1865.

DEAR RAWLINS: We have just been aboard the admiral's ship. He says there has not been a day fit for landing since the day we landed at Fort Fisher, December 25. He thinks a northeast gale is about to set in, and strongly urges that all our fleet be brought in two wait for good weather, as he thinks it impossible for them to stand a gale twenty-five miles out. General Terry will follow his advice, but will keep the transports away from here and out of sight as long as possible, giving them orders to run in at the last moment. The admiral thinks we will have good weather in four or five days at the change of the moon, and does not expect it before. General Terry is at once ordering ten days' additional coal and rations for our fleet. This bad weather is very unfortunate, but I don't see that we can do anything but trust to the admiral's judgment in that respect. He says the rebels abandoned Fort Fisher the night of the 25th, entirely.

In haste, yours,

C. B. COMSTOCK,
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,January 8, 1865
