HEADQUARTERS,June 23, 1864-4.45 p.m.

Brigadier General WILLIAM T. H. BROOKS.

Commanding Tenth Army Corps and Line of Defenses:

I am ordered by the lieutenant-general to re-enforce Smith as much as possible. You will therefore send Turner's division at once. I will see him about retaining his pickets at the old mill, where it may be dangerous to disturb them. All else of the movement is left to you. The lieutenant-general desires this relief to reach Smith so early as to enable Burnside to be relieved and join Meade's left before morning. I need not say to you that I desire the utmost exertion to make dispatch. We are accused of moving slowly. Let us in this instance show the injustice of that accusation. We can forward the necessary supplies and extra ammunition to-morrow. The men are wanted to-night. Let the troops march at once.

BENJ. F. BUTLER.
