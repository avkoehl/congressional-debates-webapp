HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, December 12, 1864 - 7 p. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

DEAR GENERAL: I send you a couple of letters* from Wheeler to Kilpatrick, from which you may draw inferences as to the former's whereabouts. The officer who brought them was sent off again, and told if there was any answer we would find some way of communicating to Genera Wheeler. Some of his escort told our men he or they belonged to Ross. I will inform Generals Slocum and Davis -could have sent these earlier had I not expected you. Captain Audenried has just arrived, and yours to General Slocum has been sent. The firing we heard before you left this morning was by his battery on the river and the enemy's gun-boats-two of them and a transport (naval) tried to go down the river, but the battery disabled and captured the latter and drove the former back. He got some 25 Confederate naval men and officers, and some few stores. A few hours' work will repair the steamer.

I am, General, yours, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, December 12, 1864.
