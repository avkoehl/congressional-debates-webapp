Major-General. FRENCH, Commanding Division, Gainesville:

GENERAL: Notwithstanding my application to General Stahel for cavalry, 200 or 300, he declined leaving any. I have made applications to headquarters of the army for cavalry, but the reply I received was such as to deter me from asking again. I will use all the cavalry I have to scour the roads, keeping none in reserve. The men captured this afternoon were taken at Hay Market. They have all been recaptured. They were pumped dry. There is nothing new. I am, sir, very respectfully,WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding Corps.
