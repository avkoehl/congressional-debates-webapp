tary of War assumes the responsibility of firmly sustaining General Floyd or of ordering him back to winter elsewhere. Be this as it may, it is my opinion, right or wrong, and it is a conclusion of my mind frankly expressed.

Yours, respectfully,

A. W. G. DAVIS.

THOS. G. RHETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., November 9, 1861.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

SIR: I have habitually neglected to keep copies of my letters and telegrams addressed to you since you entered on duty with the Army of the Potomac. Desiring now to have them, I request that my friend, C. D. Fountain, may be permitted to take such copies from the originals in your possession.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

HEADQUARTERS, Centreville, November 9, 1861.

General WHITING:

DEAR GENERAL: I received your letter yesterday,* but was too much pressed to answer immediately.

I like you plan much; cannot answer for the guns. I have submitted your letter, with recommendations, to the War Department.

I am mourning over the loss of Jackson's brigade, ordered to Winchester against my remonstrances. The Secretary of War will probably establish his headquarters within this department soon.

Yours, in haste,J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
