HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK, Little Rock, Ark., May 20, 1864.

General West,Brownsville:

Colonel Geiger's pickets attacked on the Des Arc road; probably by some of McRae's guerrillas. I have ordered him to send out and drive them away. Our cavalry ought to whip these small bands and not allow them to annoy us.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BROWNSVILLE, May 20, 1864.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR,

Little Rock:

It is probably, as you say, some of McRae's men. If Geiger wants help I shall give it to him, but do not anticipate this. Am somewhat embarrassed by the detention of a train at Devall's Bluff. Captain Carr has been notified. If everything goes right at Devall's I shall move on Austin to-morrow morning with eight days's rations. Shall not stop there.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BROWNVILLE, May 20, 1864.

Captain B. O. CARR,

Little Rock:

After I had landed my force here one of your trains went to Devall's Bluff, the other remained here. The one that went to the

Bluff should have returned here by 6.30 p. m., as they reported it had left at 4.30 o'clock. At 9 o'clock I found some accident, and sent the other engine with a few platform cars and 100 men to see what was the matter. Mean time I heard that the train that left the Bluff in the afternoon was detained at the Y by your orders. As it had my subsistence on it I took the liberty of ordering it her so that I might march from here at daylight. Now the attack upon the pickets at the Bluff may change matters. Please communicate all this to General Carr. The only order that I gave to your train was the one that the detained train should come forward.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General WEST,

Brownsville:

It would be well to lay out a small field-work at or near Brownsville and set the garrison to work. It should not be too large for two or too small for five companies, with place for one or two cannon, and should be in sight of the railroad; should be convenient
