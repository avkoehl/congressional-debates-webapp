rations he had been so happy to-day to hear com-
ing from that distinguished quarter.
Mr. RIVES thought there was no sort of pro-
priety in reffrnng the bill at ail, and could find no-
thing in the Parliamentary Manual which required
a reference. The rule, according to Jefferson's
Manual, would require t at ¡he select commi'tee
should be composed of a majority of the friends
of distribution. If (he rule was regarded, nothing
else could be done. The only benefit of c"mmit-
ment would be to get a select committee to make a
report favorable to the-question of repeal. Mr. R,
denied also the truth of the remark laid down by
the Senator from Alabama, that the public judg-
ment had bsen given against this measure.
He saw bo evivence of the fact in the recent
elections, and if that Senator could cor vince him
that what he said was true, be would retrace
his steps. His mind was unbiased upon this mat-
ter, and open to conviction. The only position fa-
vorable to a fair and candid discussion was to dis-
cuss it in committee of the whole.
In regard to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury which had been alluded to in a manner
to create a panic in the public mind, he thought
that exaggerated notions hat. been advanced. This
$14,000,000 deficiency grew out of the issues ot
the Treasury notes authorized by the late Admini-
stration, and the mnbility of the Dppattment to
negotiate the loan authorized at the special session
cf Congress.
Mr. ARCHER and Mr. PRENTISS, who
spoke very briefly, took the same view of the
case, and opposed not only the reference to
either of the standing committees, but to a select
committee, or to any committee whatever. After

The question being on the motion of Mr. CAL-
HOUN to commit th- bill to a select committee,

REFERLNCE OP THE PRB-sIDBNT'S MESSAGE
The House resumed the consideration of the following branch
of the resolution heretofore offered by Mr Fillmore
Resolved, That so much thereof [1 e ol the President's
message] as relates to the tarifbe deferred to the Committee
on Manufactures                              /
Which resolution Mr AthertiJn had heretofore moved to
amend by striking out the words "Committee on Manufac
tures," and inserting the words "Committee of Ways and
Means"                        .                t

Manufactures                          4 /
After a few prefatory remaiks deprecatory of the expecta
tion of any set speech, Mr S expressed his surprise that on a
simple question of reference between two standing committees
of the House the entire policy of a protective tarín" should
have been drawn into discussion, and an effort made to control
the votes of members by their general views tor 01 against such
a policy For himself, he should be governed in his vote not
by the genenl question of the constitutionality or expedien
cy of a tariff for protection, but simply by the nature of the
functions assigned, respectively, 0 the two committees m
question The Committee on Manufactures had originally
been raided for the consideration of the ques'ion of protective
duties, and the whole subject of the tariff had always been re
fened to that committee, and never to the Commute ofWays
and Means He was indisposed to depart from the established
practice of the House Mr S said that although a tariff de
bate did not legitimatelv belong to this simple question on lefe
rence, yet as gentlemen had succeeded in eliciting, to some ex-
tent, an expression of opinion m different quarters of the House,
he was not disposed to conceal what were his sentiments in re
lation to it Some gentlemen had taken the ground that even an
incidental protection of domestic industry was unconstitutional,
yet our most enlightened statesmen had held and ably defended
the opposite sentiment And it was absurd to maintain that this
Government was so powerless, so utterly nerveless and lneffl
clent, as to be unable to extend protection to the industry of its
own citizens He declined going into the constitutional argu
ment butmsistpd that, on a mere view ofexdediency, no period
could ever be so favorable as the present to regulate and place
on a permanent basis the protective policy of this country It
could now be done with less of collision and difficulty than m any
pa=tperiod OuiTreasurywasempty theGovernmentwasoora
peiledfiom unavoidable necessity to devise a system of taxation
to supply the deficiency in the revenue, and if might with com
parative ease be now so arranged that while the direct purpose
of revenue was secured, incidental protection might at the
same time be extended to such interests as needed it Mi S
contended that this was the idea intended by the Piestdem in
that clauseof his message which related to the subject of du
ties on 'mports, and so believing, he rendeied the President his
thinks for theiecommend irion By a short but conclusive and
convincing argument the Executive had shown thatthiscould
be effected
Hew Mi S went m'o some severe comments on the adverse
doe rmes of fiee trade and a "horizontal' ta iff So fai as he
could understand the gentleman from South Carolina, and
others who advocated such doc rmes, they maintained that in
la) mg duties for revenue regaid might not constitutionally he
had even to incidental protection a more absurd position he
never had heard advanced Cany out the principle, and lm
j Ose one umfoiin rule of taxat on without any discrimination,
onda tax that woul 1 utterly pío trate and deploy somesources
of íevenuc would leave others scarce at all aftectel and thus,
m effect gentlemen's boasted principle would, m practice,
create that veiy bugbear they so much dreaded, a protective
tariff
Mr 3 nect directed his attack against what is called 'the
fortv bale theory"—a theory which firs made its appeaiance
in the House in the shape of an illuo ratio", by Mi McDuffie,
of the anti (arlff scheme of South Carolina, viz that the
producéis of exports were the payers of the whole duty on
imports Thfs dogma contained the substance of the whole
theory Mr ¡5 utterly denied that it was true m fact, and
facts, being utterly against it, were sufficient to upset the
wnole supeistructuie, however ingenious He would piove
tne theiiy fafae by a /educUoad absuidun if the position
of this firty bale dortnne were ttue, then it must follow that
Pou'h Carolina, Georgia Alabama, Mississippi, and a few
moie of oui Southern States, paid one half of aU the duties
levied in the United Sta us, because they raided one half the
exrorts of the country, and then it would follow that these
were the only States that consumed foieign luxuries But
was the fact sy? Was it not true that the non slaveholdmg
States consumed moie of them than thes'avel oldirg Sfc-tesi
Wis it customary to give these luxuries to the slaves! Ue
believed not But he womd cany the proof still furthei if
the do trine «ere true, then the 7th Congressmna' District 01
the ^tate of Maryland ought to consume ihe whore of the fotci^n
luxuiles imported into the State, hi t to his certain knowledge,
! is was not so, foi he be! eve 1 the city of Baltimolt alone
c msumed more of them than the whole Sta e lesidc—av, an i

san 1 fdd and furnishing materials for a Cv mmei^e which
should whiten with its sails every sea, and sprtal 1 se'l to the
remotest limits of the world To witness such a result oin true
polry was to cast a shield over the industty of our ow n people
This the Government could do, this it was bound to do
Ml   5, here ad vetted to the absurdity of the jo'icy which
would throw open our ports to th  manufactures of all the
world, while, at the same time, our own products were carefully
and systematically excluded fiom admission abroad And on
this topic, he adverted to the duties levied on American tobacco,
which he characterized as openly insulting to the Government
and people of this country With many expressions of dis
gust and indignation, Mr S. here went into some details to show
the actual state of things on this subject, as fixed by the revenue
laws of different couutnes in Euiope, commenting .  he j ro
ceeded on the enormity of exacting such a tubute from the
agriculturists of the United States to fill the exhausted treasu
rie  of the aristocratic Governments of the old world It was a
condition to which the American people could not longer sub
mit without dishonor And here he took occasion to dojustice
to a late Administration, which had used every effort, by nego
nation and remonstrances, to effect the redress of this great na
tional injury, but in vain In support of this position, he re
ferred to, and quoted, communications from Mr Stevenson, our
late envoy to Gieat Britain, from which it appeared that, m re
ply to his remonstiances and repiesentations 'he British minis
try could not but admit the irjtistice and hardship, and even the
impolicy of the case, but pleaded, in reply, the delicate and ha
zardous nature of the task, especially m the present position ot
that country, of attempting a reduction of foreign duties The
maxim of that Government seemed to be that of the dying misei
to his son " My son, get money, honestly, it you can, but, my
son, get money "
Mr S again adverted to the doctrine of the advocates of
fiee trade They saw and were compelled to admit the fla
grant injustice and injury thus done to us byothei Govern,
ments, yet they could not give up then darling max'ms the
theoiy must be carried out at all hazards and at every expense
However others served us, we must throw open our arms to
the whole world, and proclaim to all nations, "send us all you
can raise—we will receive it free of all burdens—serve us
meanwhile as you like ' For the sake of the pride of an ab
surd and extravagant system, they were willing to have m
fiicted the most ciuel oppression on a large class of their fellow
citizens He hoped the House would be governed by no such
wild theories, but would takethe proper means to put an end to
a state of things which "was degrading and disgraceful to our
country
Mr S here adverted to the desire professed by Mi Slade,
in his speech of Monday, to have protection extended alike to
all the industry of the country, whether free labor or slave
laboi He trusted the gentlemen and his friends would not
"keep the promise to the ear and break it to the hope ' He
trusted wben the law came to be framed that they would not
turnabout, and, having their own interests protected, g ve the
go by to every other section of the Union If they acted like
true men, he would go with them to the last, but he shou'dre
serve himself to see what their course would be He never
would consent to protect one interest of the country, ard leav e
another, which far more needed protection, wholly unprovided
foi Gentlemen need not expect this He never would do it
Must Rhode Island have her cotton goods protecteo, and Ver
mouther sheep and Pennsylvania her iron, an I ever} State m
the Unon be attended to and the tobacco of Maryland be passed
byt He trusted not If that was the policy of gentlemen it
could not be known too soon
[Mr Goode, of Ohio, fiom theCommittee on Unrolled Bills,
reported that that committee had examined the bill making ap
propnations in part for the civil department fur the year 1¿42,
and had found the same to be correct Whereupon the bill
received the signature of the Speaker ]
Mi LIMf, of New York, would not stop to mo me whether
this debate on the general policy of a protective tariff d'd oi
did not, legitimately connect itself with the simple question as
to which committee of the House should have charge of a cer
tain clause in the Executive Message The hanging ¡' on 'he
skirts of so narrow a question seeme 1 the result of tha' pohu
ca' cunning which is the wisdom of weakness, but, ¡nee it
had commenced, he hoped it would proceed
