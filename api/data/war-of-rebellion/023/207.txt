By command of Major-General Buell:

J. M. WRIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, July 23, [1862].

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Your telegrams of the 19th or 20th just received. The cipher was unintelligible, and had to be repeated. Lieutenant Craighill belongs to the Engineer Corps. He has been [here?] ten days. He came under orders from the Secretary of War.

This place could no more be held by one regiment than by one man. The enemy evacuated it with a force of 6,000 men, although he had re-enforcements within a few hours' march. I need at once at least five companies of artillery; four to have here, one to advance. I am trying to store supplies, but Wolford has seized one of our trains and our requisitions are not filled. As to other supplies we are very short.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, July 23, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Some days since troops were assembling at Kingston with the avowed intention of invading Kentucky, but it is on the road to Nashville. There were 1,100 cavalry there and a brigade of infantry was expected. Morgan left Somerset for Tennessee on yesterday; he has done much damage. I will order two regiments of Spears' to convoy six pieces of cannon now at Lexington, but the guns will be useless without men to work them.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

General.
