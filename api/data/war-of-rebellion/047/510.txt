CHARLESTON, S. C., November 17, 1863 - 12 m.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy's Morris Island batteries and four monitors opened yesterday heavy fore on Sumter and Sullivan's Island batteries; damage slight; few casualties. Two monitors apparently injured slightly. Ironside still silent at her anchorage; moved once toward Cumming's Point, but soon returned without firing. She must have been injured by the cigar torpedo-boat David.

Should these two platoons be compelled to cross these bridges, they must be directed to destroy them, so that they may not be used by the enemy.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
