1869.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Many Members. "Yes!" "Yes!"
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Now,
then, shall we have this unseemly scene 
Calls to order.
The PRESIDENT. No debate is admis-
sible.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I am not
debating; and neither calls to order nor arbi-
trary proceedings can override the privileges
of this House.
The PRESIDENT. If the gentleman is not
debating lie will resume his seat. [Laughter.]
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I appeal
from the decision of the Chair.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair will not
entertain the appeal.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I appeal
from that decision.
The PRESIDENT. Nothing is in order
but the statement of the vote.
Mr. WOOD. Have we a Sergeant-at-Arms
attached to this body?
Mr. SHANKS. Will it be in order to ask
for the reading of the rule governing this body ?
The PRESIDENT. It would not be in
order.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I object to any further
proceeding on the part of this body until that
appeal is entertained and action is had upon
it, by this body. [Loud shouts of "Order!"
" Order! " and great confusion.]
Mr. CALLIS. Mr. President, I rise to a
point of order. I cannot believe that members
pn this floor are in earnest when they indulge
in such undignified 
Cries of "Order!" "Order!"
Mr. CALLIS. If it be in order, I move that
this convention now adjourn.
The PRESIDENT. That motion is not in
order.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I rise to a point of
order.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I call my colleague to
order.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I make the point of
order that an appeal cannot be taken from the
decision of the President of this body. [Re-
newed shouts of " Order!"]
The PRESIDENT. There is no appeal en-
tertained. The gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr. Butler] will resume his seat.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts, [amidgreat
uproar.] I am in order. I desire the reading
of the joint rule upon the subject of counting
the votes, which expressly states that a vote
cannot be counted unless both Houses concur.
I do not know of any power which the Presi-
dent has to override the rules. [Loud cries of
"Order."]
The PRESIDENT. The tellers will perform
their duty under the concurrent resolution as
directed.
I object.
The Chair understands
Now the
Senate can
[Laughter
Mr. INGERSOLL.
The PRESIDENT.
that. [Laughter.]
Mr. INGERSOLL.
retire and consider that objection.
and cries of "Order!"]
The PRESIDENT. Order! order!
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Would it be in order to
have peace! [Great laughter.]
Mr. VAN HORN, of Missouri. I rise to a
point of order.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I again
insist on my appeal from the order of the
Chair.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair has decided
that an appeal cannot be entertained in the
joint convention.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. From
that decision I have the honor to appeal.
The PRESIDENT. We decide that in the
same way. [Laughter.]
Mr. VAN HORN, of Missouri. I rise to a
point of order, and I wish to state it. The point
of order that I make is this, that since the
retiring of the Senate upon the objection of
the gentleman from Massachussetts [Mr. But-
leii] there lias been no report made of the
action of both Houses upon that subject, and
we cannot proceed until a full report is made.
The PRESIDENT. The votes have all been
counted, and the statement of the result will
be made under the concurrent resolution of
both Houses. [Loud cries of " No!" "No!"
and other cries of "Announce the vote!"]
Mr. DKIGGS. 1 move that the joint con-
vention adjourn.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Let us
have the House to ourselves. [Laughter and
shouts of "Order!"] I respectfully move that
the Senate have leave to retire. [Renewed
laughter and applause in the galleries.]
Senator DOOLITTLE. I rise to a point of
order. It is that everything except the execu-
tion of the joint order of both Houses is out
of order, and I demand that that order shall
now be executed. [Loudshouts of "Order!"
"Order!" "Announce the vote!"]
Mr. VAN HORN, of Missouii. I demand
a decision on the point of order I have made
before any other point can be entertained.
Mr. DICKEY. I desire to make an inquiry
of the Chair, whether it is competent for the
Senate to decide points of order for this joint
convention ?
Mr. INGERSOLL, (amid cries of "Order!"
and the greatest confusion.) There must be
some misunderstanding with regard to the posi-
tion of the question at this time. It is not
understood by the House generally.
Senator DOOLITTLE. I rise to a point of
order.
Mr. BENTON. I object.
Mr. INGERSOLL. It is not understood.
The PRESIDENT. The gentleman, is out
of order.
Senator DOOLITTLE. I ask the Chair to
call on the tellers to proceed, [Loud cries of
"Order!" and "the vote."] I demand that
the tellers shall proceed. [Renewed cries
of "Order!" "Order!" and "Announce the
vote!" ]
Mr. BROMWELL. I rise to ask a question
about the order of this proceeding, and I think
the Chair will hold it to be a pertinent question.
I wish to know, and there are a hundred men
here who wish to know, by what authority the
Chair makes the ruling denying the right of
appeal in this convention from the decision of
the Chair ?
The PRESIDENT. We are proceeding
under a concurrent resolution of both bodies,
which lias declared how the counting and an-
nouncement of the votes shall be proceeded
with.
Mr. BROMWELL. But does the concur-
rent resolution of both bodies prescribe who
shall determine when that order is executed
in order? [Cries of "Order!"]
Mr. BANKS. I ask leave of the conven-
tion to make a suggestion which I think will
relieve us from the difficulty in which we are
placed. [Shouts of "Hear him!" "No!"
"No!" "Announce the vote!"]
Mr. ELDRIDGE. We want a fair fight.
If anybody is going to pitch in let us all have
a clianee. [Laughter.] I object.
The PRESIDENT. Objection being made,
no debate is in order and the vote will be an-
nounced. The tellers will proceed with the
count. [Cries of "Object!" "The vote!"
"The vote!" and groat uproar.]
Mr. BANKS. 1 ask leave of the conven-
tion to say a word. [Continued uproar,]
Mr.-WOOD. I hope the Chair will do his
duty. I demand a count of the votes.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I move
that this convention now be dissolved, and that
the Senate have leave to retire. [Continued
cries of " Order!" "Order!"] And on that
motion I demand a vote. [Cries of "Order!"
"Order!" from various parts of the Hall.] We
certainly have the right to clear the Hall of
interlopers. "
The PRESIDENT. The tellers will now
declare the result.
Senator CONKLING (one of the tellers)
then proceeded to declare the result, amidgreat
noise and disorder, the President endeavoring
to maintain order by repeated raps of the gavel.
The uproar continuing,
The SPEAKER said : The Speaker of the
House appeals to members of the House to
preserve order. The Sergeant-at-Arms of the
House will arrest any member refusing to obey
the order of the President of this convention.
The result of the vote, as announced by the
tellers, was as follows:
List, of votes for President and Vice President of the
United States for the constitutional term to commence

The PRESIDENT. The tellers report that
the whole number of votes cast for President
and Vice President of the United States, in-
cluding the votes of the State of Georgia, is
294, of which the majority is 1-18; excluding
the votes of the State, of Georgia it is 285, of
which the majority 143. The result of the
vote, as reported by the tellers, for President
of the United States, including the State of
Georgia, is—for Ulysses S. Grant, of Illinois,
214 votes ; for Horatio Seymour, of New York,
80 votes. Excluding the State of Georgia, the
result of the vote is—for Ulysses S. Grant, of
Illinois, 214 votes; for Horatio Seymour, of
New York, 71 votes. The result of the vote,
as reported by the tellers, for Vice President
of the United States, including the State of
Georgia, is—for Scnt7TLEr CoLFAX,ofIndiana,
214 votes; and for Francis P. Blair, of Mis-
souri, 80 votes. Excluding ths State of Geor-
gia. the result of the vote is—for Schuyler.
Colfax, of Indiana, 214 votes; and for Fran-
cis P. Blair, of Missouri, 71 votes.
Wherefore, in either case, whether the votes
of the State of Georgia be included or ex-
cluded, I do declare that Ulysses S. Grant, of
the State of Illinois, having received a major-
ity of the whole number of electoral votes, is
duly elected President of the United States
for "four years, commencing on the 4th day of
March, 1809; and that Schuyler, Colfax, of
the State of Indiana, having received a ma-
jority of the whole number of electoral votes
for Vice President of the United States, is
duly elected Vice President of the United
States for four years, commencing on the 4th
day of March, i8(j9.
The object for which the House and Senate
have assembled in joint convention having
transpired, the Senate will retire to its Chamber.
