Assistant Adjutant-General.

DETROIT, September 14, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Have seen the telegrams of 30th August and 13th September to Colonel Hill from General Fry, that of 13th preventing drafted men from enlisting as volunteers. I recommend that they be allowed to volunteer for three years in the new regiments now organizing at any time before they are accepted under the draft, and that they receive the Government bounties. To adopt this rule will insure the filling of the new regiments and give to the Government three in place of one year men, will be an act of justice to drafted men, and to a great extent will do away with much of the odium of the draft, which is important in this political crisis. In my opinion, General Fry's telegram of 30th August allows drafted men to volunteer. In consultation with you while in Washington last week you thought favorably of this plan. Please answer without delay, as time is precious to us now.

AUSTIN BLAIR,

Governor.

Brigadier General JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: On the representations in person of Mr. Commissioner Wild and Supervisors Vosburgh and Rider from the Twelfth District, that if the draft in that district were postponed until Monday they would fill the district quota, and upon a telegram from the provost-marshal of the district, that there were to be large numbers of recruits offered, I concluded to postpone and did postpone the draft in that district until Monday morning next, 19th instant.
