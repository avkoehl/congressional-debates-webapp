in opposition to it; whereas the veto of the Presi-
dent may he overruled by a vote of two-thirds of
both Houses of Congress, or by the people at the
polls.
It is obvious that to preserve the system estab-
lished by the Constitution, each of the coordinate
branches of the Government—the executive, legisla-
tive, and judicial—mustbeleft in the exercise of its
appropriate powers. If the executive or the judicial
bianch be deprived of powers conferred upon either
as checks on the legislative, the preponderance of
the latter will become disproportionate and absorb-
ing, and the others impotent for the accomplish-
ment of the great objects for which they were
established. Oiganized as they are by the Con-
stitution, they work together harmoniously for
the public good. If the Executive and the Judiciary
shall be deprived of the constitutional powers in-
vested in them, and of their due proportions, the
equilibrium of the system must be destroyed, and
consolidation, with the most pernicious results,
must ensue—a consolidation of unchecked, des-
potic power exercised by majorities of the legisla-
tive branch.
The executive, legislative, and judicial, each
constitutes a separate coordinate department of the
Government; and each isindependentof the others.
In the performance of their respective duties under
the Constitution, neither can, in its legitimate action,
control the others. They each act upon their
several responsibilities in their respective spheres;
but if the doctrines now maintained be correct, the
executive must become practically subordinate to
the legislative, and the judiciary must become sub-
ordinate to both the legislative and the executive;
and thus the whole power of the Government would
be merged in a single department. Whenever, if
ever, this shall occur, our glorious system of well-
regulated self-government will ci umble into rums—
to" be succeeded, first by anaichy, and finally by
monarchy or despotism. I am far from believing
that this doctrine is the sentiment of the American
people; and during the short period which remains
in which it will be my duty to administer the Exec-
utive Department, it wilt be my aim to maintain
its independence, and discharge its duties, without
infringing upon the powers or duties of either of
the other departments of the Government.
The power of the Executive veto was exercised
by the first and most illustrious of my predeces-
sors, and by four of his successors who preceded
me m the administration of the Government, and,
it is believed, in no instance prejudicially to the
public interests. It has never been, and there is
but little danger that it ever can be abused. JNTo
President will ever desire, unnecessarily, to place
his opinion in opposition to that of Congress. He
must always exercise the power reluctantly, and
only in eases where his convictions make it a mat-
ter of stern duty, which he cannot escape. Indeed,
there is more danger that the President, from the
repugnance he must always feel to come in collis-
ion with Congress, may fail to exercise it in cases
where the preservation of the Constitution from in-
fract ion, or the public good, may demand it,than that
he will ever exeicise it unnecessarily or wantonly.
During the period I have administered the Ex-
ecutive Department of the Government, great and
important questions of public policy, foreign and
domestic, have arisen, upon winch it was my
duty to act. It may indeed be truly said that my
administration has fallen upon eventful times. I
have felt most sensibly the weight of the high
responsibilities devolved upon me. With no other
object than the public good, the enduring fame,
and permanent prosperity of my country, I have
pursued the convictions of my own best judgment.
The impartial arbitrament of enlightened public
opinio^, present and future, will determine how
far the public policy I have maintained, and the
measures I have from time to time recommended,
may have tended to advance or retard the public
prosperity at home, and to elevate or depress the
estimate of our national character abroad.
Invoking the blessings of the Almighty upon
your deliberations at your present important ses-
sion, my ardent hope is, that in a spirit of harmony
and concord, you may be guided to wise results,
and such as may redound to the happiness, the
honor, and the glory of our beloved country.

This statement shows a balance in the treasury
on the 30th June, 1849, of $2 853,694 84, and a
balance in the treasury on the 30th June, 1850, of
£5,040,542 11. In the estimated expenditures for
the year ending on the 30th June, 1850, are in-
cluded balances of appropriations, amounting to
the sum of $3,762,537 29, a considerable portion
of which may not be required. Unless new and
extraordinary expenditures are authorized by Con-
gress, no further loans will be required, and the
public debt may be reduced.
The whole net revenue from duties during the
entire period of four years arid three months of
the operation of the tariff of 1842 (per table D)
was ^103,554,053 12; being an annual average of
$23>895,208 32 The net revenue received from
the tariff of 1846, during its entne operation fiom
1st December, 1846, to 30th September, 1848, was
(per table E) $56,654,563 79, or an average of
£30,902.489 28 per annum; being an average of
£7,007,280 96 mote per annum under the tanflf of
1846, 'han was i wived under the t.u iifofl842. The
net levenue for the first fiscal year under the tariff
of 1846 (per table A) was $31,757,070 96, being
$757,070 96 more than the estimate of this depart-
ment; and this amount would go on augmenting
every year under this act, with a favorable state of
foreign commerce and industiy, m a ratio at least
as great as the inocase of our population. As the
high duties under the act of 1842 were rapidly
substituting the domestic articles, and excluding
the foreign rival, the revenue must have declined.
If, however, the act of 1842 had yielded the average
revenue lecened during the period of its actual
operation, this, we have seen, would have been an
annual loss of upwardsof seven millions of dollars,
as compared with the average revenue of thetarifi'
of J846. With such a result, instead of a large
surplus on the 30ih June, 3850, there would have
been an addition of more than twenty-five millions
of dollars to our national debt, which roust have
gone on rapidly- increasing, lequiring, in time of
pence, new and large loans to be negotiated. If,
also, the proceeds of the sales of public lands were
taken from the treasury for distribution among
the States, the augmentation of the debt and accu*
mulatmg interest would have been still more rapid
and alarming. From thus disastrous condition
we have been saved by the tariff of 1846, yielding
fiom reduced taxes an average excess thus far of
more than seven millions of dollais over the av< rage
receipts from the tariff of 1842. Had that act
remained in force during the war, from diminished
revenue the loans must have been greatly aug-
mented in amount, with a small and declining
income, and, instead of piemiums lealizeJ, large
discounts must have been allowed.
That the re\enue w^uld have declined results
from the position of the protectionists, that by con-
tinuing the system a few years, they would supply
the whole home market with the protected domes-
tic articles, when the foreign impottation must
ccasc, and the levenue ab-o. The result, then, of
protection must be the annihilation of the foreign
import trade of the country, so far as regards pro-
tected products. With the exclusion or diminu-
tion of imports, the exports must cease or be
reduced, for foreign nations could not buy them.
We exported last year (per table F) $]30,203,7<'9
in value of domestic products and fabrics, exclu-
sive of specie, and under low duties this must go
on augmenting. But how can foieign countiics
pay for these exports; if we will take no imports,
or very few, in return? Clearly, our exports must
m time cease, or fall to a very small sum; the for-
eign markets must be destroyed; and the price of
our staple exports of cotton, of rice, of tobacco, of
breadstuff?, and provisions, must decline; for we
cannot take the return in specie from abroad with-
out exhausting those markets in a single year,
nor can we consume at home this augmenting sur-
plus. The British empire (per table G) took fiom
us (not during the year of famine, as it is called,
of 1847, but in 1848) our domestic exports, in-
cluding cotton, rice, tobacco, breadstuffs, and pro-
