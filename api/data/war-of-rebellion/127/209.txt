Montgomery, April 6, 1861.

General GOLDTHWATER,

Adjutant and Inspector General of Alabama:

SIR: Your communication of this date is received. The order you request will be transmitted to Captain White, in command of the arsenal at Mount Vernon. I desire to know when the men enlisted prior to the 28th of February will be transferred to the Confederate Government as part of the provisional forces, and also at what time the men enlisted by Captains Gee and Loomis subsequent to that date will be organized into volunteer companies. It is necessary that I should know this, that an officer may be directed to recruit for the Regular Army of the Confederate States such of the men enlisted by your State as would not go into the provisional forces or be organized into volunteer companies.

Very respectfully,

L. P. WALKER.

Hon. L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In answer to the inquiries propounded in yours of this date I have to state that it is confidently expected that the volunteer companies required to fill the contingent at Fort Morgan will be organized during the coming week. As soon as that is done the recruits enlisted up to the 28th of February last will be transferred to the Provisional Government. For reasons which will readily occur to you, I would suggest that the recruiting should not commence until the organization of the volunteer companies is effected.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. GOLDTHWAITE,

Adjutant and Inspector General of Alabama.
