At Greencastle and Mercersburg, each, one company of mounted men; two companies of infantry in the gaps between Mercersburg, Loudon, and McConnellsburg, and one in the gap between here and Gettysburg.

I am sight of Martinsburg. The rebels hold Martinsburg; small party of them just came in, and are now driving our scouts; out of the town; about five or six of our scouts had come into the town; had not been there long before rebel scouting party came in; they are still firing in the town. Getting very warm here; I must get out of this. I will go back to Hancock, and go by pike to Williamsport if you say so, and find out what is going on. Answer at Hancock.
