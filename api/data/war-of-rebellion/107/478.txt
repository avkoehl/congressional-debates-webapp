HEADQUARTERS KANAWHA BRIGADE,Gauley Bridge, September 12, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Cross-Lanes:

SIR: Two of your dragoons reached our outposts this morning about daybreak, and have just reported to me that they, with others, were fired upon by a party of my men who were encamping about fifteen miles from here. No one was hurt, and the whole might have come through. The sergeant with the dispatches went back, and from the two now here I can glean but little, except that you have driven the enemy over the river. I had ordered a party of one company of infantry and thirty cavalry forward from the advance post yesterday to push through to you if possible, but the cavalry mistook their order and staid behind. Otherwise you would have had messengers from me yesterday. No distinct firing has been heard by us or our advance parties. Since being deceived in so clear a day as Sunday was, they have not been so quick to hear it. I am preparing to-day to push forward at Wise, and if I see a fair chance I will either get between him and Floyd or drive him beyond the Sunday road. I would give my left hand for another good regiment to-day.

In haste, very respectfully, yours,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
