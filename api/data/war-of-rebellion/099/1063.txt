AUGUSTA, GA., January 30, 1865-11 a. m.

Major-General J. WHEELER, Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 29th instant just received. I thank you for the prompt information furnished of the movements of enemy. Troops are now arriving from the West and I hope we will soon have force enough to meet the enemy on either side of the river. Have no doubt you will hold them in check long enough for General Hill to get them in position. General Beauregard left Montgomery this morning for Augusta and ought to be here on Thursday. The good people of Augusta are much exerdcised in relation to the rumors of negotations for peace. I believe that Hunter, Stephens, and Campbell have been sent on some mission to the Yankee Government; but what they go to propose has noat transpired. If we could whip Sherman it would help the cause wonderfully just now.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. D. FRY,

Brigadier-General.
