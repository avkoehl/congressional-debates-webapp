until Uteevils wluch arise from this organic defect
are remedied.
Considering the great extent of our Confed-
eracy, the rapid increase of its population, and
the diversity of their interests ana pursuits, it
cannot be disguised that the contingency by
which one branch of the Legislature is to form
itself into an electoral college, cannot become
one of ordinary occurrence, without producing
incalculable mischief. What was intended as
the medicine of the Constitution m extreme cases
cannot be frequently used without changing its
character, and sooner or later producing incurable
disorder.
Every election by the House of Representa-
tives is calculated to lessen the force of that
security which is derived from the distinct and
separate character of the legislative and execu-
tive functions; and while it exposes each to temp-
tations adverse to their efficiency as organs of
the Constitution and laws, its tendency will be to
unite both in resisting the will of the people, and
thus give a direction to the Government anti-
repubhean and dangerous. All history tells us
that a free people should be vv atehful of delegated
power, and should never acquiesce in a practice
which will diminish their control over it. This
obligation, so universal in its application to all
the principles of a Republic, is peculiarly so in
ours, where the formation of parties, founded on
sectional interests, is so much fostered by the
extent of our territory. These inteiests, repie-
scnted by candidates tor the presidency, are con-
stantly prone, in the zeal of party and selfish
objects, to generate influences unmindful of the
general gooS, and forgetful of the restraints which
the great body of the people would inforce, if
they were, in no contingency, to lose the right of
expressing their will. The experience of our
country, from the formation of the Government
to the present day, demonstrates that the people
cannot too soon adopt some stronger safeguard
for their right to elect the highest officers known
to the Constitution than is contained in that
sacred instrument as it now stands.
It is my duty to call the particular attention of
Congress to the present condition of the District
of Columbia. From whatever cause the great
d( pression has arisen which now exists in the
pecuniary concerns of the ciuiens of this District,
it is proper that its Situation should be under-
stood, and such relief or remedies provided as
are consistent with the povvcis of Congress. I
earnestly recommend the extension of every po-
litical right to the citizens of the District which
their true interests require, and which does not
conflict vv ith the provisions of the Constitution. It
is believed that the laws foi the government of the
District require rrvisal and amendment, and that
much good may be done by modifying the penal
code, so as to give uniformity to its piovisions.
Your attention is also invited to the defects
which exists in the judicial system of the United
State?. As at present organized, the States of
the Union derive unequal advantages from the
Federal judiciary, which have been so often
pointed out, that I deem it unnecessary to repeat
them here. It is hoped that the piesent Con-
gress will extend to all the States that equality
in respect to the benefits of the laws of the Union
which can only be secured by the uniformity and
efficiency of the judicial system.
With these observations on the topics of gen-
eral interest which are deemed worthy of your
consideration, I leave them to your care, trusting
that the legislative measures they call for will be
met as the wants and best interests of our be-
loved country demand.

CREDENTIALS.
Mr. CLAY presented the credentials of the
Hon. John J. Crittenden, elected by the Legis-
lature of Kentucky a Senator from that State, to
to serve for six years from the 4th of March last;
which were read; and the usual oath to support
the Constitution of the United States was then
administered to Mr. Crittenden by the Vice
President.
OBTTUaRY.
Mr TOMLINSON ro<* and said-
Mr  President:   It has become my painful
duty to announce to the Senate the death of the
Hon. Nathan Smith, late a Senator from tí*c
State of Connecticut.
Arriving in tins city apparently in the full pos-
session of all his powers, my colleague and friend
interchanged the kind salutations appropriate to
the occasion with the cordiality and frankness
and vivacity which characterized his social inter-
course, ind secured the attachment and confi-
dence of those -with whom ho was intimately
associated. He retired to rest on Saturday even-
ing, as far as was observed, in the enjoyment of
his accustomed health and spmts. Feeling in-
disposed, he rose from his bed, and obtained the
advice of a medical friend, who subsequently left
his apartment without the slightest apprehension
of a fatal result. In a short time his altered ap-
pearance caused alarm, and his fnend was again
called. On his return, the heart had ceased to
beat, and he expired in Ins chair on Sunday
morning, about half past one o'clock, without
a struggle or a groan. Thus unexpectedly and
awfully was oui late associate and friend sum-
moned fiom a state of probation and tual into
the presence of the Divine Redeemer and Judge,
in whom he devoutly professed to believe and
trust. May this renewed demonstration of the
solemn truth, that in the midst of life we are in
death, produce its piopei effect on our hearts and
lives, mid be instrumental in preparing us for
the judgment to come and the retributions of
eternity.
The afflictive event which has cast such a
gloom over this body cannot fail to excite pro-
found sensibility and regret throughout the Union,
as well as in the native State of the deceased,
where he had long betn tanked among her most
able and distinguished lawyers and statesmen.
While we lament the inscrutable providence with
humble submission, it becomes us to be still—
knowing that the destinies of men and nations
are in the hands of an omnipotent and holy God,
whose dispensations are merciful and right.
With the Senate, sir, I leave the adoption of the
measures requisite to manifest its highest respect
for the character and memory of the deceased.
Mr. SWIFT then submitted the following reso-
lutions; which were unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That a committee be appointed to take order
for supeiintendingthe tuner.il ot the Hon Nvhian Smith,
which will tafct pi ice to morrow at twelve o'clock, tint the
Senate will attend the same, and that notice of the event be
given to toe House of Representatives
i Rcsohed, That the members ot the Senate, from a sincere

will go into mourning for him one month, by the usual
