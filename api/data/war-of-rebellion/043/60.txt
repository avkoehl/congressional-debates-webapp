(Received 2. 55 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have received your telegram in regard to Harper's Ferry. I find 10, 000 men here, in condition to take the field. Here they are of no earthly account. They cannot defend a ford of the river, and, as far as Harper's Ferry is concerned, there is nothing of it. As for the fortifications, the work of the troops, they remain when the troops are withdrawn. No enemy will ever take possession of them for them. This is my opinion. All the public property could have been secured to-night, and the troops marched to where they could have been of some service. Now they are but a bait for the rebels, should they return. I beg that this may be presented to the Secretary of War and His Excellency the President.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

(Received 3 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

My original instructions require me to cover Harper's Ferry and Washington. I have now imposed upon me, in addition, an enemy in my front of more than my number. I beg to be understood, respectfully, but firmly, that I am unable to comply with this condition with the means at my disposal, and earnestly request that I may at once be relieved from the position I occupy.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C.,

June 27, 1863-8 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

Your application to be relieved from your present command is received. As you were appointed to this command by the President, I have no power to relieve you. Your dispatch has been duly referred for Executive action.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
