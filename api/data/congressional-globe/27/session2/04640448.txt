yoa will still be compelled to resulate the manner of holding
the election To lay off districts, i« a thing diife remind totally

You are compelled to puke regulations for koldinsr any elec

the States should submit to this clause m the Constitution by
■which Congress might so far exercise authonty w thin a State
as to fix the time and place, and the manner of holding an
election -So jealous were they of their own internal regula
tions, that they urged objections to 'his clause of the Constitu
tion, but surely they never dreamed thaf Congress would ever
assume the right to divide a State into Pactions—into political
Com"tnunities—into districts—under thai clause winch gave au
thorny to prescribe the mode in. which an election should be
held
The Government has existed some lime, and the peo( If* of
the States have exeicised then option m this ma'ter, andl un

Mr ARNOLD said he was on this floor nominally a Whig—
nominally, merelv lie was elected on an independent t civet, and
believed, in principle, he was aiiuc Democrat líit> acquain
tances had said that, in practice, he was an ultra Democrat He
would "define his position )J Hebehevedthxtall power was vest
edm the hands of the people That was the gi and fiindimentdl
platfoim on which he stood, and, standing on that, he idvocited
the position taK.cn by the gemlen an from South Cdiolina, [Mi
J Campbell] Another fundimental principle was, that the
majority should govern, and that the nunouty have ns-hts, and
should be heard, bee tuse the warning voice oí the minority did
a great deal of good If this position was true, he said, this
amendment ousht to be adopted And he was astonished that
it should meet with such determined opposinon from any quar
ter, especially fiom those professing to call themselves Dem
ociats He íegretted that so m?ny Whigs, with whom it was
his honor to act, were found in opposition to this a netidment
He waa astonished at the speech of the gentleman from Ge( r
gia, [Mr Colojcjitt,] who piofessed to he a Demociatdyed in
the wool His position and arguments went to make a perfect
raaehme and msliument of the people, who ought to he free
agents The ceneial ticket system, which the gentleman advo
cated, would give use to thccaucusbystem.so muchdepiecated
by gentlemen on this floor A few leahng politicians would
meet together and nominate, their candidates, and the people
would vote entirely m the dark foi men they had nevci seen
The people were not m favor ot it He knew but one ins anee

The amendment was a question of expediency entuely It
involved no constitutional qmstion It tin Gomnrnent wis

to him most astonishing, as tin1 gentlennn fiom Geoigia ha1
proceeded in lu-. lemarks that he should ha/c hid such a it

Ihe genei il ticket &ystem destroyed the j. rmciplesof Demo

the voice of the mmonty wai> often drowned, because m one
half of the States the voice of ona man in an election would

Van Buren party, and to the fact that in 18-10 thu very law

Mr UNDERWOOD requeued the floor to offer an amend

He refeired to the refusal by the Jegislatuie of lumes

in which the minority undei ooktofoice the m tjonty It was

He agreed with the gen'leman from Soufh Caro ins, [Mr
Campbell,} who had very clearly shown if, t' af, by die sen

States was totaUy silenced He also wished to enlarge i
little upon an idea thiown oi t by 'he gentleman from
ííorth Carolina, {Vlx. Stanly,] that, under the general
Ijcfeirt, system, a mmonty of the people of the límted Spates
might govern this nation, and might pass evpry law on this

that eveiy mtn entitled to vote in a State had a right to vote

of the Constitution did not so understand it The district sys

conclusion, that the general ticket system was constitutional,
and the geneial dista t system unconstitutional If the district

Mi IIOUbTON said, as a m mber of the Committee ofEIec
tions where this matter had been matured, and especially as
the & ate which he in part represented had an mteiest m the
subject, he was desuo & to give his views oil the question then
under the consideration of the comm'ttee But he did not feel
willing to proceed to th& disco-Pion oí the menta of the ques-
tion, without first returning his acknowledgments to the gentle 
man from South Carolina, [Mi Campbell,} who claimed the
merit of having mtioluced the proposition undei consideration
of the House, originally fovthe particular regaid he had ex
tended to the small States, as he had thought pioper to class
them Tt was Li us that seveial of the Spates of the Union had
adopted the geneial ticket ¡system, but he tru ted, when they
learned that the peculiar Representative of the Sooth deemed
it unwise they would has i!y abandon it He had no idea that
those States would stind out against the wisdom of the gentle-
man from South Carolina, but that they would >iehlsimpíy on
the around that that gentleman knew their interests better than
tí eyknew fhem themselves Doubtless, as soon as they learn
whatthat gentleman's notions are, they will retrace their steps,
but, as far as his own State Ulabama} was co cerned, he had
a word to cay, and that was, that he did not ar^ept the gentle-
mau'b guardianship Wheievtr they cou'd he under the m-
fluenee and the ccmtioloflaw, they preferred to be so, and it
wa one of the laws of Alabama that a m'nor,o\ei the age of
foui teen yeaisf had the njfnt to select or to change his guardian
Alabama, then, was of age to e>erci*e that ugbt, and-for her he
rpjectcd the guardianship of the gentleman from South Carol!.
na itwa&notbOiauchhispü-aose to enter into the constitu-
tional question which he committee was then discussing, as to
fhJvv, it this power exists, it wa& a powei that was never in-
tend 1 to be exercised undei circumstances like these; and
.hit it was an ultra power, admitting it to exist at
all, which snould be veiy caut.ously approached. In
the fiist place then, let them see what power existed
in Congie s on the subject befoie the committee He as-
sumed it as a pioposition, that the power- di 1 exist, and he
believed it had been admitted by various gentlemen duiinir these
discussions befjre the committee, in shoit, it was denied by
none, with one so itary exception He admitted, then, that it
existed, and let them see wnat was the object of the power.
And, in the next place, let them gee the expediency arü pro-
pi íety ofevercismgitatihisune If Congress had the powei at
all Congi es^ had the same p j wer the   ates had the power was
concurient in eveiy part and paic^l, wi h the solitary exception
of the places wheie the Senators shall be chosen, but when Con-
gross thought propei to act,her act on overruled thatof theStates.
flu n he hn I it down as tiuc, that if Congie s had the power
the States possessed—and it was not questioned that theLegis-
latines of the btat°s po&ses ed fhe powei to district the States^—
it was the duty of Congress, if Congress undeitook to meddle
at all to carry it through, and peifect such legislation. The
1 mguage of the Constitution was, that Congress shall have the
powei at any time to amen I or alter such regulations as were
mide by the fetales And the object was clear, the power being
retained by Congress was s mply for the purpose of enabling
the Government to keep its whee's in motion, if obstruction
aiose in any of the States Irany S<ate neglected or refused to
provide the way oi mode m which members of Congress should
he elected, then thib Government, if she had the power at all,
had the powei to do what the State should have done. But
weie they cairmg it out by adopting the amendment proposed?
He thought not, and he would endeavor to maice it clear to the
committee that thete was a difftrence befween the pioposition
now made tu the committee, and the powei contained in
the Í oKHMtntion It was dout> less contemplated when any
powei was given to Congress to take charge of a subject, that
she would go thiough with it and complete it, m such a «ase
dsthis, by the adoption either of thedistnci-or the general ticket
sy&tem And weie they dwmg that? Clearly not They were
merely issuing an oiderto the States
Geoi.>ia now elet ted ner Representatives by general ticket;
an 1 would a simple or ler, issued in the w«y now proposed, be
such an alteiatioi as was contemplated by the Constitution1?
Ceitamlynot It would rrerely be a duecüon to the States to
altei, andno an alteiatnn itself Suppose they adopted this
amendment, end is=ued their oider, anda majouty of the States
should tefube to obey, wlwt could thty do to keep the wheels of
1  tvernment n motion"! Could they do any thing? Clearly not.
lint lfsomany should íefuse to obey as that a quorum should
not be sent to Congress, the veiy purpose contemplated would
be defeated, and they wou.d be deprived of the power which it
was intended they should exeicise in extreme cases and great
emergencies, wheie gross injustice was about to be done ty the
refusal of the fetales to send a proper representation to this
House But if the power waste be exercised at all, let them
see to what extent it might he earned They knew that a power
frequently lay dormant under the Constitution—it frequently
lay untouched for a number of years, but when they touched
it, and commenced legislation under u, they familiarized them-
selves to such power, and exercised the whole of it; eveit ad-
mitting it to be one which they could exercise If, then, they
hid the power toiegu'ate, by districting the States, they had the
power to say that one State should elect by the general ticket,
and another by the distnet system—they would have the power
todo what is called gei ymaidering, and do any thing or every
thing, even to the appointment of the judges of elections, clerks
of the polls, and all tl e mmut £e now íeserved for State legis-
lation, and it might be <=o exerted, by skill futleaders, that a tri-
umphant paity might perpetuate its power Suppose this
Congiess were to take into consideration the political aspect of
affairs, in3 undeitake to regulate wi h tha' view, why, they
might adopt the diM,u t system in one S^ate, and the general
ticket system m ano her or thty might run a line east,
we->t, north, or south, to suit then purposes But he
laid it down, as a correct principle of legislative ac
tion that they should leave to State Legislatures every
th ng that they could legislate upon, and that Congress
ousrht not to legislate on any subject, when the State Legislature
cauld do it just as well Hut there «as another reason which
str mglv opposed this amendment it might bring about a col-
lision between the State and Teder?l Goveinmenfs Suppose a
Qtdfe should lefuse to obey this order—supr o e South Carolina
should ufuse to obey v onld the ^tate Ri^h s scentlemen vete
for a 'force hill" in lesaid to her7 While, then there was a
pirspectoi bunging about a collisi n ne |ie¡(| ,, t() ^ soun(j
pohcj notto día y thirgthat would contnhu e fa such an end.
PutH was said that Congress shou'd 'al e the juris he "on that
they might ntoduce umfoimity— such a uniform ystem of le
gistatmn a  would not be subject nthe changes ar ó alternations
of pa\ ty lint he should like tj know now a distinction was to
be drawn; he should like to know how this House was further
removed from party feeling than theLegisiaturesef the States:
he would like to know wha* man here, of whatever party,
j     would not sooner trust to the action of his State Legislature,
