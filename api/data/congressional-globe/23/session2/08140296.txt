EXECUTIVE BUSINESS.
On motion of Mr TIPTON, the Senate then
proceeded to the consideiation of executive busi-
ness, and when the doors were opened,
ItAILROAD THROUGH THE PUBLIC IANDS
1 he Senate took up, as in Committee of the
Whole, the bill authorizing the Leavenworth and
Bloomington Railroad Companies to construct
railroads thiough the public lands of the United
States, which, after somesl ghtamendments, was
repotted to the Senate,and ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time
THE PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The Senate then resumed the consideration of
the bill regulating the deposites m the State
banks
The proviso offered yesteiday by Ml Calhoin,
requning the payment of two per cent by banks
for the use of public deposites on sums under
one bundled thouband dollars, to be regulated by
toe Secietary of the Treasury, being under con-
sideration,
Mi WEBSTER moved to strike out "one
hundred thousard dollars " and insert " fifty
thousand dollars," which amendment was agreed
to
Mr WEBSTER moved an additional section,
directing tnat each bank of deposite should ren.
der the same services to the Government as Was
rendered by the Bank of the United States, in
that place.
Mi CLAYTON said it was goirg as far as
they could go, but not to the extent of obligation
to which the Bank of the United States we e sub
ject by the charter
Mr KING, of Alabama, said they were asking
more of the denosite banks than of the Bank of the
United States They were compelling thesebanks
to pay two percent ¡while the Bank of the United
States paid nothing The notes of that bank were
made a legal tender, while the notes of the State
banks vveie not
Mr K thought such restrictions would tend to
keep the ryublic moneys out of thegood banks and
place them in those less secure lie said the
Bank of England received pay for all the public
services it performed He be'ieved thebill would
produce the same evils which they were endeav
onng to pievent, that of endangering the public
treasures
Mr WEBSTER said the public money was
the same as a permanent deposite, for the banks
would soon, by comparing the past and present,
be able to calculate the usual amount in deposite,
and could calculate upon it as a permanent sum
which they ought to pay interest for
Mr W said theie was a stipulation in the late
bill for rechartenng the United States Bank, by
which it was to pay two hundred thousand dollars
a yen into the treasury as a bonus, which would
be two pet cent upon ten millions of dollars He
wished to regulate bylaw what now was ¡egulated
by the S cretary of the Treasury
Mr KING, of Alabama, said he was in favor
of the additional section But he wished to turn
the attention of the Senate to the other impositions
which were laid on the banks, then tendency
would be to pievent the deposites being received
at any safe and i espectable institutions
Mi CALHOUN said the advantages of being
a deposite bank were \ery gieat He thought
there would be banks enough, willing to receive
them with the imposition of the bill
Mr CUTBBERTsud the Bank of the United
1 States, by nears of its branches, was enabled to
4 perform transfers and make exchanges, which
were in fact advantageous to itself    But from the
isolated natuieof the State banks, they were m
some measure deprived of these advantages
Mi WEBSTER said, these same arguments
of the honorable Senator had been urged in favor
of the Bank of the United States at a former
time.
Mi TIPTON said he was well satisfied that
the banks of Indiana would not pay one cent—
but that the Government would be obliged to carry
its moneys out of the State He should vote against
the bill
Mr PORTER thought the Senator's [Mr
Tipton's] remarks a wietched commentaiy on
what had been said last year, " that the State
banks could peiform the services of the Govern
ment better and cheaper than the Bank of the
United States "
The question being on agreeing to the proposed
amendment,
Mr EWING asked the yeas and nays, which
were ordered, and the question decided as fol-
lows
YEAS—Messrs Benton, Bibb,Black, Brown,
Buchanan, Calhoun, Clay, Clayton, Ewing, Pie-
Unghuysen, Goldsborough, Grundy, Hendricks,
Hill, Kane, Kent, King of Alabama, Knight,

Pieston, Roobms, Robinson, Ruggles, Shepley,
Silsbee, Southard, Swift, Tipton, Tomlmson,
Waggaman. Webster, White—37
NAYS—None
So the amendment was adopted
Mr WEBSTER then moved further to amend
the bill, by inserting a clause requiring the banks
to make monthly returns of its condition, and
tnat these returns should be published quarteily
Mr KING, of Alabama, thought no bank
would become a depository if Us private concerns
were to be published to the world every few
months In reply to Mr Porter, Mr K said
he would deny that theSecretaiy of the Treasury
ever had said the public business could be done
better and cheapei by the State than by the United
States Bank In support of this assertion, Mr
K read part of the Secretary'  report on that sub-
ject
Mr CLAYTON thought the returns of the
banks ought to be published It had been re-
quired of the United States Bank, and was also
lequired of the Bank of England Mi C was
desirous of get'ing as much fiom the State banks
as the Bank of the United States paid Us in a
bonus
Mr EENTON said he was m favor of the pub
hcation He wished to do away all seciecy fiom
banking institutions The public ought to know
how such things were managed He believed it
would be of public use He would say the com
munity seemed to be recovering their rights against
banks He believed the Bank of the United
States was the greatest opprobuum that had been
cast upon the nineteenth century There weie
six hundied machines in the Union throwing oat
paper money—worthless paper In these insti-
tutions were two hundred millions of capital on
which an annual tax was paid of eight per cent
That tax was taken fiom the people some way or
other, either by hook oi by crook, for the banks
of themselves produced no value
Mr B wished the people to haie money on
which they paid no mteiest He was in favor of
having oui real money sifted out fiom such a mass
of paper trash, even it but a speck of gold re-
mained from a bushel of chaff He was entirely
opposed to the papel system Tins opportunity
stmck him as a favorable opportunity toi íetnbu
tive justice, for making the bai ks pay foi estab
lishing a hard money currency They should
obtain something to defray the expense of the
mints That while six hundred banks were
stamping paper money, there might be severa!
mints stamping hard money
Mr CLAYTON, by the unanimous consent of
the Senate, made a motion to reverse the order
foi a recess, which was agreed to
Mr KING, of Alabama, called foi a division
of the question, when that part which duects
monthly returns to be made was agreed to
On that part requiring the quarteily returns to
be published, Mr CLAYTON asked the yeas
and nays, which were ordeied, and were as fol-
lows
YEAS—Messrs Benton, Bibb, Calhoun, Clay,
Clayton, Ewing, Pielinghuysen, Goldsboiough,
Hill, Kent, Knight, Leigh, McKean, Naudam,
Portei, Prentiss, Pieston, Robbins, Robinson,
Southaid, Swift, Tomlmson, Wagganran, Web-
ster, White—25
NAYS—Messrs Black, Brown, Buchanan,
Cuthbert, Kane, King of Alabama, Linn, Morris,
Ruggles, Shepley, Tallmadge, Tipton—12
So the amendment was adopted
Mr WEBSTER said he had one or two other
amendments to offer which he would premise by
a few remarks In the discussion of this measure,
it seems a necessary consequence that we should
be diawn into comparisons between the ability
and efficiency of these local banks to peiform the
fiscal operations of the'Government, and the
Bank of the United States He wished to say
now, that he did not go into such comparisons
for the puipose of reviving the question of a pro-
longation of the Bank of the United States He
considered the recharter of the present bank or
the charter of any other under the authonty of
this Government as settled, at least for some tin e
to come And he imagined there was to be no
attempt made to revive it He had determined
not only that he would rot make any movement
towards effecting its recharter, but he would never
move for the establishment of another bankunder
the authority of this Government till this country
should be convinced by experience of the utility
and the necessity of such bank We live in a
Government in which the settled opinions of the
people must prescribe a dist.net course of conduct
to public men When that time shall ai rive that
the people of this country shall be convinced that
some national institution of this sort shall be ne-
cessary and useful to the country, he should Le
as leady as othei gentlemen to act upon the sub-
ject and bring it before the public Until then,
he should be entirely passive with respect to it
And tíieiemarks which he had made upon th.s
bill had not the slightest allusion to the revival of
