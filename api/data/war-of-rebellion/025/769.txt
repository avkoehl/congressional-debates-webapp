VICKSBURG, November 29, 1862.

Captain W. O. KEY,

Post Quartermaster, Vicksburg:

SIR: I will be compelled to have wagons and trains for the transportation of stores now accumulating here on the river bank to the ware-houses prepared for them in the rear, and will have to urge upon you the importance of giving me all the aid you can at once, and also suggest that you procure teams and harness for the wagons now idle, so that they can be made available. This is a matter of great moment to the Government, and as I cannot move a thing from the river until I get transportation you will please give it your immediate attention. I have no doubt that a proper man of activity and energy were sent into the country from 10 to 50 miles from here a sufficient number of plantation wagons might be had here in a very short time.

Very respectfully,

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.
