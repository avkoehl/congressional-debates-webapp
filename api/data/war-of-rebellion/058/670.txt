JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., February 4, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

I have issued orders transferring Major-General Wharton to Trans-Mississippi Department. It is suggested that you make arrangement for some other officer rather than withdraw Brigadier-General Robertson from General Beauregard. If not, you can arrange with General Beauregard.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

RICHMOND, VA., February 4, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

You are authorized to restore the original organization of Cheatham's division; papers returned by mail with President's indorsement.

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Morristown, February 4, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Dalton, Ga.:

The enemy seems to have his main force between Maryville and Campbell's Station. Please keep me advised of the condition of the enemy in his rear so far as you can. He is not inclined to fight, if I can judge by his recent movements.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

DALTON, February 4, 1864.

Lieutenant-General POLK:

Can you not send Loring's division to Rome immediately? I have every reason to believe that his assistance may be of vital importance at the earliest moment at which he can get to that position. If you have a brigade nearer Rome send it, I entreat you, in advance of Loring.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
