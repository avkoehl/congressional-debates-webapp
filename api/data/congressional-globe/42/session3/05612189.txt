THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2180
Mr. PRATT. I object.
_ Mr. FRELINGHU YSEN. I make the mo-
tion that the committee be discharged.
1 he PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from New Jersey moves that the Calendar be
postponed, and the Committee on Pensions
discharged from the further consideration of
the bill.
Mr. TRUMBULL. He cannot make two
motions at once.
Mr. PRATT. I make the point of order
that the eommittee to which the bill has been
referred cannot be discharged without a day's
notice.
Mr. CONKLING. It was ruled the other
day that they could not, by a vote of the Sen-
ate. I do not think it was right, but the Senate
so decided.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I hope the Sen-
ator will not interpose an objection against
the will of the Senate.
Mr. CONKLINGr. May I be indulged in
making an appeal for one moment to my
friend? The very best authority on the sub-
ject said here a few moments ago in my hear-
ing that if we would go through with the Cal-
endar of unobject-jd bills from the House,
they could all be disposed of in half an hour.
Now there are a good many people 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. 1 will wait if
the Senate will agree to pass this bill then.
Mr. CONKLING. I was going to suggest
to my friend that he will have an opportunity
to make his request then. There are a good
many people on this Calendar that I know,
who are not the children of Zachary Taylor,
but the children of nameless men, and they
are poor, too, and they have some cases here
which I know about myself, that have just as
much merit as this. Therefore I hope that we
shall go through with the Calendar.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
sustains the point of order, and the Senator
from New Jersey withdraws his motion.
Mr. CONKLING. Now let us have the
regular order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Calen-
dar is before the Senate, and the Secretary
will report the first bill.
The first bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 1592) for the relief of certain officers
of the Navy who were dropped, furloughed,
or retired under the act of February 28, 1855.
Mr. STEWART. The understanding is that
no Senate bills are to be called.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
understands that no Senate bills will be re-
ported by the Secretary, but only House bills.
Is that the understanding?
Several Senatohs. That is the understand-
ing.
WILLIAM JOHNSON.
The first House bill on the Calendar was the
bill (H. R. No. 2887) for the relief of William
Johnson, of Ripley county, Indiana; which
was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to pay
to William Johnson, of Ripley county, Indi-
ana, $130 for one horse belonging to him, and
which was on the 14th of July, 1863, taken
by the military forces under General Hobson
and applied to the service of the United
States.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.

Mr. CONKLING. That bill has been re-

previous order. The Secretary will proceed
to report the House bills on the Calendar with
favorable reports.

out of the Treasury at this session.
Mr. SAWYER. My colleague will allow
me to say that this takes no money whatever
out of the Treasury.
