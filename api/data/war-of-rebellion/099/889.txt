Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that in compliance with orders from corps headquarters, I broke camp at 9. 30 a. m. this instant, moving in rear of the First Division of this corps upon the Goldsborough road, crossing both Little and Big Cohera Rivers to Newton's Grove, and from thence upon the Clinton road a distance of half a mile, where two brigades of my command and battery are in bivouac and position. One brigade is in position at Newton's Grove covering the Fayetteville and Goldsborough and Smithfield and Clinton roads, and so posted as to prevent a surprise from the enemy's cavalry, and can be easily withdrawn upon my main line. My command has made a march of ten miles over heavy roads.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brevet Major-General.
