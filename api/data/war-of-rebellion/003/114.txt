I advanced towards Totten's (enemy') battery. I advanced to a position some 500 yards from the battery, where I remained before the line of the enemy some twenty-five or thirty minutes, when, falling back, I again rallied some other stray portions of the regiment, and marched by orders to join the right wing on the left of the field. This I did, and having reformed the regiment, I received orders to move so as to place myself in the rear of the enemy's battery (Totten's), then closely engaged in its front.

Although moving as expeditiously as possible, I did not reach the proper position until Totten's battery had been drawn back in retreat. Some of the enemy still remained on the hill and in a ravine. I, however, hesitated to attack, having discovered a force immediately in my rear, whom I did not ascertain to be friends for some twenty minutes. I then ordered the advance, attacked the enemy, and put them to flight. In this the regiment was very gallantly assisted by a detachment of Missourians and others, whom I then supposed to be under the immediate command of Captain Johnston, and who placed themselves under my command. This fight ended the engagements of my regiment for the day. The regiment was formed upon the hill previously occupied by the enemy, and by orders was marched back to their camp. The first engagement of the regiment commenced at 6.30 a.m., and the last ended at about 1.30 p.m. When the enemy made their final retreat my men were too exhausted to make a successful pursuit.

I transmit herewith a list of the killed, wounded, and missing,* recapitulating as follows: Killed, 1 commissioned officer, 1 non-commissioned officer, and 7 privates; total, 9. Wounded, 3 commissioned officers, 6 non-commissioned officers, and 39 privates; total, 48. Missing, 3 privates.

I also transmit a report of Major W. F. Tunnard. [Numbers 28.]

Proud of the manner in which my regiment behaved in their first fight against the enemy of our Confederate States (a fight in which officers and men displayed endurance, bravery, and determination), it is difficult for me to particularize the services of officers or men. I will, however, bring to the notice of the commanding general some cases. The whole of my staff acted with great coolness and bravery, the lieutenant-colonel leading a battalion in my absence against Sigel's battery, and the major assisting constantly in the rear wing. Captain Theodore Johnson, quartermaster, was of invaluable service in transmitting orders, rallying the men, and encouraging them to stand by their colors, often exposing himself to the fire of the enemy. Adjt. S. M. Hyams, jr., left horse and fought bravely on foot. Captain Thomas L. Maxwell, commissary, followed the regiment in battle, and assisted much in rallying the men. The lamented Captain R. M. Hinson fell when gallantly leading his company in the charge against Sigel's battery; a nobler gentleman and a braver soldier is not to be found. Sergt. Major J. P. Renwick was shot down in my sight in the first fight, while bravely fronting and fighting the enemy. He was the first killed of the regiment. Dr. George W. Kendall, a volunteer surgeon, on the field was active and untiring in his exertions to relieve the wounded. In the reports of company commanders many acts of bravery and gallantry by non-commissioned officers and privates are mentioned. With the consent of the general commanding I shall seek hereafter occasions to show that their conduct has been noted.

I cannot conclude without saying that the conduct of Captain James
