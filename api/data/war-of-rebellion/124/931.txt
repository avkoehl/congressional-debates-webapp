The estimates for the next fiscal year have been prepared with care and will not admit of curtailment. They are based not only on the probable wants of the Army during that period, but embrace also the cost of fabrication of all the heavy guns and carriages which the united industrial forces of the large foundries and our arsenals can supply for the better arming of the sea-coast and frontier fort and batteries. Our supply of guns and carriages for these places is now far behind what it should be; and it is not only desirable, but of the utmost importance, that ample means should be placed at the disposal of the department to put them in a complete state of defense as speedily as possible.

The principal articles of military supplies which it is the duty of this department to provide, and which it has procured by fabrication and purchase, and which it has supplied to the Army during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1863, and also the number or or quantity of each which remained on hand at the arsenals and depots at that date, are stated in detail in the accompanying statements.
