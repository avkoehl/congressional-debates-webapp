Question. When with General Hooker did you hear that orders were given?

Answer. As soon as I reached General Hooker I gave information that Colonel Hecker's brigade had arrived and I understood, either from General Hooker himself, in person, or some one of his staff, that Colonel Hecker's brigade was authorized by him to halt there. At this moment Colonel Hecker himself came up, and I remember that General Hooker recognized him speaking somewhat familiarly, as though he knew him well. I remember afterward that either General Hooker or General Butterfield gave the order directing Colonel Hecker as to the formation, in order to face, if need be, either to the Smith Hill or to the front, as he had been marching. I had received two orders from General Howard, and two only, and had communicated them one to General Steinwehr, to which I have alluded, and one to Colonel Buschbeck.

Question. To whom had you pointed out the place where General Howard could be found?

Answer. It was on the second meeting with Colonel Hecker and staff that I pointed out the place where I had just left General Howard, either to Colonel Hecker in person or to some one of his staff, I cannot say which.

Question. Did you inform Colonel Hecker that he would have to stop his column at a certain place?

Answer. I have no recollection of giving him any such information.

Question. Did you not communicate to Colonel Hecker what you had heard when with General Hooker?

Answer. I think it possible, and even probable, that I communicated that information to Colonel Hecker relative to General Hooker's desiring him to halt, but I have not as distinct a recollection about that as I have about some other matters.

Question. Was my column not marching during the whole time and as often as you met me?

Answer. It was until this last meeting, which was almost simultaneous with Colonel Hecker's meeting General Hooker.

Question. Did you not, some distance from the cross-roads, give me the order to go there and halt?

Answer. I remember that either General Hooker or General Butterfield gave the order regulating Colonel Hecker's formation, so that he might face either to the hill or to the front as it might become necessary. I do not remember communicating this or any other order to Colonel Hecker at the distance he mentioned from the cross-roads.

Question. Was not my column marching when you brought me the order, and did I not stop in consequence of that order?

Answer. I believe, I have stated that Colonel Hecker's column was marching each time on meeting it, and I believe that I stated further, that it is possible and even probable that I communicated the information that I received either from General Hooker in person or from some member of his staff, that Colonel Hecker was authorized by him to stop there. As to whether Colonel Hecker halted, in consequence of anything that I communicated to him, I cannot decide.

Question. Were you not all the time with me and saw me when for the first time I met General Hooker?

Answer. It was after my return from Colonel Buschbeck that Colonel Hecker met General Hooker in my presence, and I believe it was the first time of his meeting him, from the manner of General Hooker greeting him. I then went forward to look for General Howard.

Question. Did you not finish your previous conversation with me with the words. "There is General Hooker himself?"

Answer. It is my impression that I did say those words to Colonel Hecker. I will add as to the matters of conversation, I do not so distinctly remember the words as in the matter of orders.
