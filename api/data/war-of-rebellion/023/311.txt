ATHENS, August 11, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have under arrest some Confederate soldiers who claim to have been discharged from service on account of disability. A part of them are willing to take the oath and some are not. Also some citizens applying for passes to go through my pickets, who refuse to take the oath under any circumstances. Please inform me what I shall do in such cases. Please answer soon.

[JAS. M.] NEIGLING,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 11, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel NEIBLING,

Athens:

Send the Confederate soldiers who claim to be discharged to provost-marshal at Nashville, unless in special cases, when you may deem it best to release them on oath and watch them. If there is anything suspicious in civilians who try to pass the pickets send them in like manner.

Colonel STARKWEATHER,

Woodville:

Did you send out the expedition yesterday as ordered? Report in regard to it.

D. C. BUELL.

BROWNSVILLE, August 11, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Your first dispatch was not received until 3.30 p.m. yesterday and the second at 4 p.m. I therefore put my infantry into wagons and moved as rapidly as possible in accordance with your orders. Remaining in camp overnight at the point named by you, saw no enemy; saw nothing of the other columns of your troops, but heard of them being near. Returned this morning to camp, where I await further orders.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 11, 1862.

Colonel SWORDS and Captain SYMONDS,

Louisville:

It is probably true that Morgan is advancing into Kentucky again with 1,800 men and four pieces of artillery. As he will probably attempt to destroy the railroad, push forward supplies in the mean time to the full capacity of the road.

D. C. BUELL.
