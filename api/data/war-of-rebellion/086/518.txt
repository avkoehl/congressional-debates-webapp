Please send two of your strongest white regiments, under command of a good officer, to Natchez with the least possible delay, to return as soon as the emergency has passed. The general's condition is favorable, everything considered.

(Received 3.15 p. m.)

Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Brigadier-General Lee and myself have matured a plan which we think promises to effectually clear out the back country of rebels. It will require all the cavalry for a week. Will such an expedition interfere with the arrangements of the major-general commanding department.
