General J. G. MARTIN:

GENERAL: I observe by paragraph II, Special Orders, Numbers 172, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, that your resignation as brigadier-general Provisional Army of the Confederate State has been accepted by the President. I very much regret that the tender of your resignation did not pass through my hands,as I wished at least to have the matter suspended for the present. What I wish to know is whether you could not retain your position and duties in the Confederate service in addition to those appertaining to your State office. I would desire that you should be placed in immediate command of the forces within the lines of the State of North Carolina, so that General Hill would be enabled to give the most of his time and attention to the troops in Virginia, and especially those along James River.

Please inform me at your earliest convenience whether the arrangement I propose is compatible with your views, and oblige, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE.
