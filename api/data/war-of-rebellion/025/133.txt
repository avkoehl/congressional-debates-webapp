JACKSON, July 29, 1862.

General McCLERNAND, Bolivar:

Have your ordered the men I had at Toone's Station to Medon? If not, I hope you will do it. I have sent one company to Medon to-day.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

Brigadier-General LOGAN, Jackson:

I sent 100 men this morning to Medon. There should be at least 150 men to guard there and half way to Toone's. General Ross will guard the other half and from Toone's. You will relieve the men sent by me to-morrow by sending about 70 more men, which, with what are there now, will be 150.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN A. LOGAN, Jackson:

I ordered you to send a company to Medon and you did not do it. You had more than two regiments at Jackson. You had four companies besides which had been ordered here, and are mistaken in saying they were all delayed as camp guards. The bridges north and south of Jackson within a few miles were destroyed. You have not been asked to re-enforce anybody from your present force. I sent a force to repair the wire and bridge at Medon. The wires are repaired and the bridge nearly. What was your telegram of yesterday but a gratuitous complaint? But enough.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

JACKSON, July 29, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

I have at all times obeyed orders. The bridge at Medon was not destroyed for want of force at Medon. There were enough to protect it. I understand your ordered to leave 100 men at Toone's Station, and not at Medon; this I ordered Colonel Rhoads to do. I am not mistaken about the camp guards, two companies, you speak of, or provost guard, detached. I had no orders to relieve them. It is true the bridges have been destroyed, and certainly they are not the first ones that have been destroyed; in this case if I am to blame I can bear my part as well as any man. I did not say that I was asked to re-enforce from my present command, but spoke of re-enforcing the points guarded on railroads. I know the wires have been repaired, and I shall repair bridges and will try to do it without much delay. I have no complaints to make of any kind, but will do my duty.

JOHN A. LOGAN.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

I found to my surprise that you had not sent an additional company to Medon. The wire was cut in that vicinity. I sent this morning to repair. If you had apprehended an attack on bridge north of Jackson
