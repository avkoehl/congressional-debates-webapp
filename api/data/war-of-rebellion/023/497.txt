SEPTEMBER 8, 1862.

Colonel MIHALOTZY:

The cavalry and artillery will join you this morning. Move your train off so as to clear the road at once. Keep yourself in communication with the telegraph until your convoy is well under way, as I may want to communicate with you. Use all possible energy and judgment to push the trains forward and avoid confusion.

D. C. BUELL.

The division that have not already turned off on the Gallatin road will keep on the Bowling Green road via Three Strings. All wagons, except those that have been authorized to accompany the troops, are to go under convoy via Springfield and Russellville, for which orders have been given. Report your position.
