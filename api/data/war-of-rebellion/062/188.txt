GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE MISSOURI, Numbers 18. Saint Louis, Mo., January 30, 1864.

In compliance with orders from the War Department, I hereby relinquish the command of the Department of the Missouri to Major General W. S. Rosecrans, U. S. Volunteers. In doing so, I desire to express my thanks to the command for their good conduct while under my orders, and also to the loyal citizens within the limits of the department who have so generally accorded a coridl support to the measures instituted for their protection and the peace of the community. In relinquishing the command, I am proud of the honor of having as a successor the general whose brilliant deeds in command of the Army of the Cumberland have made his name illustrious.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, January 30, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Division of the Mississippi, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Having turned over the command of the Department of the Missouri to Major-General Rosecrans, in compliance with General Orders, Numbers 28, current series, from the War Department, I have the honor to report to you for orders. Will you please give me an order for myself and 4 staff officers, 6 horses, and baggage, from Saint Louis to Knoxville? Also, as I shall probably leave Saint Louis before receiving the order of the President assigning me to the command of the Department of the Ohio, it will, I presume, be necessary for me to have your order to assume that command on my arrival at Knoxville. I will be ready to start for Knoxville to-morrow evening.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
