To be applied to the national debt, and the articles of tea and
coffee (which are likely to make so many high tai ff men) left
out ofthe estimate altogether
With the deficit s t easily piovfded for, I ask what reason can
be urged on principle against awarding to the states their just
rights?
Will it be contended tha they will derive no benefit ftom
their several distributive shares'? Have they no purposes to
which they might apply them 1 No debts to pay ( IS o taxes
on than uti2ena which might be alleviated? No embina«s
mentó among (he people which might bo lightened by i judi-
cious application of the fundsf I know that it is a favonte de
claraüon, and seems to have giown into a doctrine wnh d cer
tarn party hure that there is no "want or embarrassment" m
the country The great leader ofthe Democratic parly in the
^eua'e a day oi two since, sal I that none such existed any wheie
in the land I find that this doc-tune is inculcated as best aub
serves party purpo&es Here, foi the purpose of defeating the
action of Congress on the gteat questions which are called to
our consldeianon, wt ate tuld that no kmdot wdntoi emudi

With the viewofretnevmg their lost fortunes, and again get mg

or mined And, sn, tiie pending eleUio 1& are made to tutti
Upon the existente of embarrassment and íehef winch embar

pro e^sion of faith tney are resorting here to every manujuvie
of party discipline to defeat a jy thing being done for the tenet
oi the eouutiy, willing to íorce upen ua rumour and depieciated
currency, tottop the operations of the Government foi the win t
of means to cauy non, and to thwart every reasonable scheme
that piomisos good to the people
But, sir, ifGeor^ia had hei snate of the public lands u would

but to hope that this bill may be so amended as th it, in atcoid
anee with my opinions ot what is right and in accoidance
wi ü the wishes of oui JLegi-Jituie, I can vote for it as an act of
sheer justice to the states For, upon principle, the issue pie
seated is, whether the S ate<! shall ba deprived of then ngnf,
tha* the cousumers ofaiti les duty lree may «stiH hemdulgtdin

An instil >us att mpt is ma nc to prejidice the nglite of
the states, by i íeiiuíymg this measute with the assumption of
¡state debts This, sir, is the "raw head and blooJy bonne"
wiiich party virulence presents to every proposition which 't
opposes, and against which it has no arguments to offer, with a
view of alarming those who cannot be led by persuasion For
one, Í shall look to the intrinsic merits of every proposition pie-
acnted to me, and, judging of each by itself, and for itself, act
acLOrding'y I design not tobe persuaded against my judg-
m*1 it, noi to be alaimed by any appeal to my fears
More than ten y ears ago the States commenced demanding a
distubution of this fund aecoiding to the terms of ces&ion At
thaUíme, very few, if any, ol the debts now owing by them
weiecorirrtcted How, then cuuU they h?ve be*ni i> fiuenced
to make thH demand to piocuie me assumption of at ebf wh ch
did tt >t then existí Con icfiKut has always bee i clamorous
fortius distubu mo, sho owed no debt when she nade the
firstaemand and owes none now ÍSoith C ir Muía has not
been behind hei siUei S ate  in demanding this distribution,
shejoweJnotVbt, owesnot!enow,andhasaiedundantlrexsury.
How could these States be actuated by the mercenaiy mo
tive of having their debis assumed, when they owed none?
Sn, H is enough to withhold irom t* e States their rights,
withoutimpeachiug the motives of "their citizens in demanding
ihem

]eas t willing to admit the fact Thtee schemes are beiore the
conn ry, each with its advocates, and embiacin  all conflicting
opinions, and though no one scheme may succeed, bejn? op-
posed by both of the others yet any two united will prevail
Anj with the absolute certainty that these landi are doom? \
the only question left to be sealed is, which is the best plan to
dispense most exact justice to all the States? The pre emp-
Uo i system the favorite measure oftlae late Democratio par-
ty5 proposes to wrong the States out of the best latida at the
lowest pnce*, and to throw them into the hands of those who
have the fleetest heels and fewest ties to bind tham to the coun
try, and who, constiBUtmg a large voting population, will not
forget the bosom which warms them into being This is the
Democratic ache i e of getting clear of the lands, ard will be
adhered to under ail circumstances foi self interest, and m sa-
crifice of the rights of othtia The cession «cheme proposes to
rob the residue ofthe Union, to throw a bribe mto the laps of
the new States in the next Piesidentia! canvass It is the bant
ling of no party, and is only offered as anucleus around which
to loi*m one 1 he distubution plan proposes to give something
to all the States, and has mere of justice in it than any other
one submitted 1 he gentleman from Maine says that it was
dictated <md concocted in party caucus, assuch matters usually
aie I suppose he has exact infuimatiun on that point, but,
if Í know any thing of its origin, it will be fomd to haveaiKen
from the demands of the States for justice—to have once pass
ed both branches oí Congress^ when hi3 mends had the powei
here, and was defeated by an appropriation of the bill lo bis
own usps by GeneralJackson—to have been recommended by
the present Chief Magistrate, as an act of justice to the States,
andtoh?V3 come to u& through a repoit ofa standing commit
tee ofthis House
JNow, with these facts befóte us, the important question i«,
which of the«e plans should we adopt, m view ot doing the
gieatest justice to the gieatest number?
I throw out these suggestions foi those who assert for Con
gress the right, undci the Constitution, to make such deposition
ofthe proceeds of the landa as H pleases
I come dow, in the last place, to state my objections to thp de
tailsof the bill, and which, if net modmed, will pieven' my eup
port of it
The fiist section provides that the States of Ohio, Ind anaf
Illinois Alabama, Mi-souri} Mississippi, Louisiana, Aikaneae,
and Michigan, shall, in addition to what each is entitled to by
the terms ol compacts enteied into between them and the United
States upon their admission into the Union, receive ten percent
uponthenettpioceeds of the public lands within the hunts of
each State icspectively This is to be paid before distnbunon
tabes place, and then these States aie to shaieequally with all
the rest, according to representative population I he seventh
section provides that each one ol these ¡states shall receive ofthe
United States a sufficient quantity of land to make up to each
State the amount of 500 000 acres, to be selected withinthc
limits of «uch State m such manner as the Legislature thereof
shall direct
1 hece provisions aie manifestly unjust, and create a distinc
tion in favor of the new States, in violation of the deeds of cts
sion, pioposmg an equal distribution of the lands ceded 1 hat
they should have some advantages over the old State1 , I think
manifestly just, for deprived as they are of control and owner
snip in the soil they must be helpless coiporatinns in truth, if
liberal donations of soil are not given to them Bt sides, for all
national purpose^, without this donation, they must rely exclu
sively upon taxation—wh ch their people cannot be?r—oi e se
they must content themselves to remain mere cipheis n the
Union a pismon which 1 am not willing to see mem oceuj y
Ihese btafes pmhrace i great and gmwirg pcop e They aie
now, and are destined io be, the most impoitant sec un of
our Union Tor one, rather than stay their progress for a
moment, in their onward march in science, and in the de
velopment ofthe \ast lesources of their territory, I would
accelerate them at every step, and wish them God speed I
do not, therefore, complain of what they have received I do
not complain of the percentum paid them ait then admission
mto the Union. I do not complain of what they have received
for works of internal improvement, for purposes of education,
nor for what th<*y are to receive for similar purposes, but t do
say and I tnink, a* a Representative of an old State, I have a
right to complain that these States are not satisfied with what
they have and are to receive, but that, afterffivmgthem ailtr-a
ig demanded .sju'it and equal after allowing them all they
claim, that then a large bonus is to r>e allowed them, an*l for
what? Foi no other reason than that they have been made what
they are by the favor md partiality ofthe old States
The following statement taken from the doenments of this
House, will show what donai ions in money and land have been
and are to be made t« these Slates exclusive oí the ten per cent
to be paid under the first section ofthis bill

This table, Mr Chairman, shows with what liberality this
Government has dealt with the new States I do not complain
of this liberality—I would not wrest from them «. dollar Which
they have íeceived, butl must gay, that In all conscience ikey
should be satisfied with what they ime, and s iouI 11 oi Bay*
loek like, demand the veiy last pound in the bond ism there
is no bond, we are under no obligation to have acted so libe-
rally wnh them, they have received all they are enti 1c ] to, and
should be satisfied That they have received what 13 chaiged
to them is evident from the report of the ¡secretary of the 1 rea-
suxy, dated 7th of February, 1839, from which I hare txuaeted
the foregoing statements
And now I would a^k, why is it proposed, in addition to what
ha& been íeceived, and suit is to be received by thase States, to
giveth^m ten j,er cent of th&nett proceedsoi tht «ales of the
lands, and then give them an equal sham acrordir g to popula-
tion with the other totales? lam told that it is because they
increase moie rapidly in population than States excluded. If
this be the reason, it is unequal in its operation as to the Estates
included,and unequal to the States excluded Ohio basim-
creased her population within the last ten years at the rale of
sixty two percent, Michigan at a rate of near sixhundered
per cent, Alabama at the rate of eighty seven p> r cent;
Illinois at the rate of twohundred percent, and a nke dispropor-
tion is found to exist among all the favoted States Now, if
jmstice is the object sought by this featureoftho bill,-why in
Michigan placed on a footing with Ohio, and Illinois w<th Ala
bama? Ii it is proper to discriminate between the States in-
cluded and tho«eexciuded,why do you notdiscrumnatebatween
those included?
Among the excluded States, Virginia, North and South Caro
lina, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maryland 1 ave not in
creased at an average of five per cent in their «gf lesrate popu
lation Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Maine, and IScw loik liave
inoreabed at an average of twenty five per cent , and Georgia at
the ,ate oj thuty five per cent.
Why put these States upon an equality, when put ha great
inequality exists m their relative increase of population"  Sir,
thereis nojusticein it. Tho distribution, if made, wd te irate
upon the next census, the increase of population wilt theü ba
feltand lebpected, and surely that is enough without providHng
lor an mciease which has not yet taken place Yfta ire §0 ng
to pay these States twice over, once for the mciease ltstli, and
then for the prospect of another
Oi, if you aie deteimmed to demand the last shi'lme, then
do justice to all Distnbute to each State, not iccordmg to
any arbiíiiry lule which you may and which you have a?
sun ed but according to the relative inert tac of each tatate n
population With that 1 would be satisfied, butif (be uisiinc
tion is made otherwise, it muet be for some naeutonoub cause,
it is then an appeal to my chanty, and not to mv ju&tice, and of
that I must judge by the facts
But this bill contains another provision in violanon of the
fleet's of ces&iori It is proposed 11 take anew paitner into the
film—the District of Co urnbia nit rccoerit.erM y any ot the

moral and legal obligation rests upon uc to do so, wenevercon
