is occurring in your command. Push forward your cavalry reconnaissances as far south of Luray as possible, even if it should head to daily conflicts with the enemy.

Keep yourself advised as far as possible, and spare no money for the purpose of [learning] every movement of the enemy from Harrisonburg and along the west side of the Shenandoah. I desire especially to know the position and character of the bridge and fords over that river.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Washington, D. C., July 18, 1862.

General PIATT,Winchester, Va.:

I have had no report from you for several days. What is the condition of affairs around you? I see reports in the papers of a force advancing against Winchester and talk of your force retreating toward Harper's Ferry, &amp;c. Let me hear from you immediately. Report to me every day.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Washington, D. C., July 18, 1862.

General PIATT,Winchester, Va.:

You are to understand that your command is posted and intrenched at Winchester to defend that place to the last. It is better to lose your whole force than to make a hasty or discreditable retreat. I apprehend no attack on Winchester which you cannot readily repel, and if large forces are advanced against you be sure that I shall assault them in the rear before they can make any impression on you.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

WINCHESTER, VA., July 18, 1862-4.40 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

Your dispatch, giving me definitely to understand what I am here for, is just received. The tone of the dispatch would intimate that I had in some way given you to believe that we would not hold this place. I have no knowledge of such an intimation or what would give rise to it. In my reports to you I have endeavored to state explicitly what is doing here. This I believe to be my duty. The reports that come to me represent the people jubilant in Winchester over some good news. Their pickets are at Newtown. This may be the case, but let it be what it may, they will find us here.

A. SANDERS PIATT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
