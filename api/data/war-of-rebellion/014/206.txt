HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 1, 1862.

Captain GOLDSBOROUGH,Flag-Office, Fort Monroe:

A battle commenced yesterday between this and the rebel army, which is still undecided. Can you not order the gunboats on James River to move up as near Richmond as possible. It would undoubtedly prove a good co-operation for me. Now is the time if you except to give me any assistance, and not a moment is to be lost.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 1, 1862-6.40 p.m.

Brigadier General E. V. SUMNER,Commanding Second Corps:

From further information the general commanding is convinced that the dispatch send you by Major von Hammerstein exaggerates matters.

The general does not think it probable that you will be attacked in the morning, and if you are, he thinks it will not be in so large force but that you can hold the ground you now occupy. He will communicate with you frequently, and he would prefer that you do not fall back to-morrow, even if you are not attacked, until you receive orders. I will telegraph to you frequently, giving you all the information we receive. The best place for you to send dispatches is to General Heintzelman's headquarters.

A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
