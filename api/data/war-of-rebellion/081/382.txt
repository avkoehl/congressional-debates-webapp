Major-General BIRNEY, Commanding Second Corps:

My pickets are in the same position as yesterday before I swung my left back, and the position agreed upon between us, but I have not yet ascertained whether they have connected with yours. Do you know? I shall not move my line of battle forward until the connection between our pickets is established, and not until I hear from and communicate with you. When I move my line of battle it will be to about the position agreed upon by us yesterday. I am going to army headquarters and will be back here shortly.

H. G. WRIGHT.

Major-General.

Major-General BIRNEY:

By direction of General Meade I am to remain in my present position and to hold my picket-line as at present-that is, in the position it occupied yesterday connecting with you. I presumed you had received similar orders, as you cannot advance without breaking connecting with my right.
