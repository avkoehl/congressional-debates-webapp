FARMINGTON, May 30, 1862-11.10 a.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

My command will move at once. Price and Van Dorn retreated to the northeast, whether toward Danville or farther east I cannot yet say. Our 20-pounder Parrotts enfiladed their camp yesterday, killing and wounding 80 men, as prisoners informed me. Nearly a hundred horses were found in their camp killed by our fire. I ordered Captain Williams yesterday afternoon to fire four shells from his 30-pounder Parrott battery in the direction of the town. One of them destroyed a locomotive and killed the engineer within a few yards of the depot. I have not heard from Elliott, though I am informed by prisoners that it was known yesterday afternoon in Corinth that the Mobile road had been destroyed 40 miles south.

I shall be at my old headquarters until 4 o'clock p.m.
