THE RAPIDLY WITHDREW, AND IMMEDIATELY OPENED FIRE FROM SIX GUNS AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT A MILE. A SPIRITED ACTION ENSUED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, WHEN THE ENEMY CEASED FIRING, AND LEFT THE FIELD, FOLLOWED BY OUR FIRE AS LONG AS THEY WERE IN SIGHT. TWO OF THEIR GUNS WERE SMOOTH BORES, AND THEIR SHELLS ALL BURST SHORT OF US. THE RIFLE SHELLS WERE, AS USUAL, OF SUPERIOR CALIBER AND QUALITY TO OUR 3-INCH AMMUNITION. SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRING CEASED, THE WHOLE COMMAND MARCHED FOR BOONSBOROUGH, ARRIVING THERE JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK ON THE 6TH. KILPATRICK'S DIVISION MARCHED ON THE MORNING OF THE 6TH FOR WILLIAMSPORT AND HAGERSTOWN, BUT I COULD SEND BUT ONE SECTION WITH HIM. MY AMMUNITION WAS NEARLY EXPENDED-THE PERCUSSION SHELLS ENTIRELY-AND MEN AND HORSES WERE WORN OUT, WHILE KILPATRICK HAD A FRESH DIVISION OF CAVALRY AND TWO BATTERIES LATELY EQUIPPED. IN MY OPINION THE SAFETY OF MY GUNS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED BY EXPOSING THEM IN THE CRIPPLED CONDITION OF THE BATTERY. THE BEST HORSES WERE COLLECTED, AND ONE SECTION FITTED OUT BY BORROWING AMMUNITION, AND, UNDER COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT MEINELL, MARCHED TO WILLIAMSPORT, WHERE HE WAS SEVERELY ENGAGED. HE REJOINED THE BATTERY, WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT AT BOONSBOROUGH, ON THE MORNING OF THE 7TH, HAVING HAD 4 HORSES KILLED. I WILL ADD THAT OUT OF COLONEL HUEY'S BRIGADE OF CAVALRY, WITH WHICH WE HAD SERVED, ONLY 200 MEN COULD BE MOUNTED TO ACCOMPANY LIEUTENANT MEINELL'S SECTION, SO SEVERE HAD BEEN OUR PREVIOUS SERVICE. ON JULY 8, THE BATTERY WAS AGAIN ENGAGED WITH THE ENEMY AT BOONSBOROUGH. ON JULY 10, THE BATTERY MARCHED TO KEEDYSVILLE WITH COLONEL HUEY'S BRIGADE OF CAVALRY. CROSSED THE ANTIETAM, AND PROCEEDED UP THE RIVER, RECONNOITERING THE ENEMY'S POSITION AT JONES' CROSS-ROADS. ENGAGED THE ENEMY AT THAT POINT, DRIVING BACK THEIR SKIRMISHERS.

ON JULY 11, AGAIN ENGAGED THE ENEMY JUST BEYOND JONES' CROSS-ROADS, FIRING CANISTER AT SKIRMISHERS, PLACING A SECTION OUT ON THE SKIRMISH LINE. ADVANCED ON THE 12TH, AND TOOK POSITION JUST IN FRONT AND TO THE EAST OF SEINT JAMES' COLLEGE. MARCHED TO WILLIAMSPORT ON THE 13TH AND TO NEAR FALLING WATERS.

ON JULY 15, MARCHED TO HAGERSTOWN AND TO BOONSBOROUGH.

ON THE 16TH, MARCHED TO HARPER'S FERRY, AND CROSSED THE POTOMAC, MARCHING TO SHEPHERDSTOWN.

ON THE MARCH TO THE LATTER PLACE, LIEUTENANT KELLY, IN THE ADVANCE WITH TWO GUNS, WAS CHARGED BY A SQUADRON OF CONFEDERATE CAVALRY, WHO DROVE OUR OWN CAVALRY BACK ON TOP OF HIS GUNS, BUT THEY SHORTLY RALLIED AND DROVE OFF THE ENEMY. THE SAME NIGHT THE ENTIRE COMMAND RETURNED TO HARPER'S FERRY.

ON THE 17TH, RECEIVED ORDERS TO REPORT TO CAVALRY CORPS HEADQUARTERS, AND ACCORDINGLY MARCHED FROM HARPER'S FERRY TO BERLIN, MD., ON THE 18TH.
