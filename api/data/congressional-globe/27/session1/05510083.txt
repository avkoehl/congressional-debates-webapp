Public Lands—Mr. Floyd.

whom the decision pri perly belongs, except to ex-
press my conviction that there is not and has not
been the least danger that any step woald be taken
towards him not fully sustained by jus íc , huma
nity, and sound pol cy Any step which did not
strictly comport with these would shock ihs wnole
community
Having taken <h" ground, I have indicated that
we ought to have received explanation before we
we responded to a peremptory demand, there we
ought to have rested till we had first leceived ex
planation It is a maxim, that he who seeks equity
must do equity, an1, on the samp principle, a Go-
vernment that seeks to enforce the laws of nations
in a particular case against another, ought to show
that it has first observed them on its own part in
the «ame transaction, or at least show plausible
leasons for thinking that it had None, but a proud
and haughty nation like England, would think of
making the demand she has without even deigning
to notice our complaints against her conduct in
connection with the same transaction, and I cannot
but think that, in yielding to her demand, under
such circumstances, the Secretary has not only
ailed to exact whit is due to our rights and honor,
as an independent people, but has, as far as the
influence of the example may effect it, made
a dangerous innovation on the code of inter-
national laws I cannot but think the princi-
ple in which the demand to which he yielded
was made, is highly adverse to the weaker
power, which tte must admit ourselves yet
to be, when compared to Great Britain. Aggres-
s ons are ra/ely by the weak against ihe stronger
power, but the reverse, and the practical effect of
the principle, if admitted w uld be to change the
responsibility of declaring war from the aggressor
—the stronger power—to the aggne\ed, the v eaker,
a disadvantage «o g eat, that the alternative of
abandoning the demand of redrew for the aggres-
sion would almost it variably be foxed o i the
weaker, rather than to appeal to arms This case
i>s'\t will furnish an illustration We have been
told again and agam, in this discussion, that in
jieldtng to the demand to release McLeod «e do
not surrender our right to hold Great Bri'am re-
sponsible, that vie have the power and will to exact
justice by arms This may be so, but is it not felt
on all sides that this is, I will not say empty boast-
ing, but that it is all talk? After yielding to the
peremp'ory demand for his imraedta c re'ea e, a(
ersending the Attorney G-neral to look alter hs
safety, and empliyirs able counsel to defer 1 htm
agtunst the law* of the State, the public feeling
mus* be too much let down to think of taking so
bold and responsib e a meaiuie as that of declaring
war The enly hope we could ever have had j<r
a redress fot the -fgres ion would have open t  de

SPEECiFoFMR. FLOYD,
OF NEW YORK,
In Ihe House of Representatives, June 30, 1841—On
the bill to distribute the proceeds of the sales of
the public lands, and to grant pre-emption rights.
The question pen ling be ¡>g on the mom n ol
Mr. Clifi ord to strike ou theenac írg c'ause—
Mr J G FLOYD addressed the committee as
followc
Shakspeare tells us, Mr Chairman, that Ihe
mad Prmee Hal, having, for his vices, ljng been
in the shade ot the King's displeasure, was, by
means of promises of good behaviour, restored to
the favor of his royal father. He hastens with the
good news to his bottle companion and dependant,
Falstaff, the fat knight of Eastcheap. Hear their
dialogue
"Prince Henry—I am good friends with my
father, and may do any thing.
Fals'aff—Rub me the exch quer the first thing
thou doest "
Sir, said Mr F I can fancy that something of
this kind it now taking place in this country I
can fancy that an American Prince Hal, after re t
ing many ye^rs under popular disple isure for his
political tricks,, again imagines him«elf in favor,
and with a swaggering boast says, "I may do any
thing " And I can fancy that from a million oí
hungry throats of starving partisans, I hear the cry
come up, like the rush of mighty waters, "rob us
the exchequer the first thing thou doest "
Sir, I have no doubt this will be done I have
no doubt that the party now in power, after growl-
ing for twelve years in a minority, will ful y
illustrate the proverb, "set a beggar a trtde and
he'll ride to the devil "
No man who looks about him and sees who are
throughout the cou try the leaders of the domi-
nant party, can doubt that their great object in ef-
fecting a change of Admin straticn was money,
and no one who knows the means used to a -
quire power, can doubt that ihe means use ' o ac-
quire ire uonej, vill be ¡n pcrlec 1 u , i ?, ir<l
that the law and lie CinsHuion vil be sei at
naught—the public fai h vi ated—and every prr-
cip'e of nonesty and morality will be trampled un-
der foot, which stands benveen these Federal poli-
ticians and their picy—the publ c wealth
Far be ltfiom me to flatter myself that what I
can say will induce any individual of this Federal
legion to falter in his course, but it is neverthele s,
my duty to those who sent me here, to expose, so
far as my humble abilities will enable me to do so,
what I c nsider the unmitigated infamy of the mea
sure now bstore us
I do ni t deny that theie is a great propriety in
bringing forward this bill as one cf the first m"a
sures of thi Admt nstration,it is mpe eci keeping
wtih the cnaracttr of the dominant party, tnat their

ner detailed in this bill
It is well known that at the ttme of ihe adoption
of the Constitution the claims which some oi the
S a es made to the western lands were cons dered
as serious objections to the ratification of that in
strumei t by several of the smaller States, on the
ground that their influence would be nnfelt in a
conre 1 racy with such immense empire?, and some
of h>m!, the State of Maryland being one, refused
to come into the Un'on unt 1 these lands Wire ceded.
To obviate this objection, the States claiming these
lands granted them to the U. States.    The State of
New York, then, as always, foremost m every good
work, authorized her de "gates in Congress to cede
alt the lands beyond her pret,"lit v astern border, "for
the use and benefit of such of the ÜlMed States as
shall become members of the Federal alliance of the
said Stales, and for no other vse or purpose tchatso-
evtr," and m pursuance of this authorny, her dele-
gates in Congress, on the first day of March, 1781,
executed the deed of   cession   frem that   Sta e.
Following the patriotic example of New York,
the Siate ot Virginia empowered her delegates in
Ccn^iess  to  execute a deed of cession of all her
claims  to the lands northwest of the  river Ohm,
upon this  condition among others, that the lands
ceded ' tha'l be considered  a common fund for the
use and  benefit of iwk cf the United Stales as have
become, or hhall become members ef the confederation
or Federal alliance of the said States, Virginia inclvr
stve according to  their usual respective proportions
in the general charge and expenditure, and shall be
faithfully and bona fide disposed of for that pur-
pose,  and fm   no other use or purpose whatsoever "
There were subsequently deeds of cession from
Massachusetts, Connecticut, South Carolina, North
Carolina, and Georgia, which vary little in their
terms from the conditions in the deeds from New
York and Virginia. Such is, in brief, our title by
cession from the S ates Note here, however, that
t le States ce 'ed merely the right to purchase of ths
Indians, and that nearly or quite all of the lands
covered by those grants have been paid for out of
the pub ic Treasury, m pursuance of ihe several
t ei is will  be Ind an" who ( ccnpied them
Be ore tl e e cessions were m Je it was con-
tcideü by ihe Stales which had no pretence of
claim to any of them, that the e lands were, before
tae Revolu ton, Crown lanas and that they passed
to the Confederacy by the event of ihe Revolution;
and that our best, if not only title to them, was by
conquest, and so belonged, in common, to all who
aided in bnrgmg that eventful struggle to a suc-
cessful tenninatioi This position was strongly
urged, especially by the smaller S ates, asj a reason
why the States claiming them should make the ces-
sion of them to he Union And such is, in brief
terms, our tule by conques , bat here, too, it should
te borne in miud that this ti le by conquest was
subj ct lo ihe possessory ngnt of ihe aboriginal
oceupanls, and that they have, from time to time,
b>nn paid laige sum  ot money, in order to peifect
the tule 11 the United Siates.

sions of mi h I hive sp< ken, and io assure the
fsaes ¡hit tne chnds should, it gra ted, be dis-
pi ed of accord up; to ¡he sill ol tne gran'or ,

Such a e the terms on which the public lands
were «cqmred If it is claimed that the ceded
lands belong to the several Sates, and should,
therefore, b- di tnbuted, it should be sufficient to
answer, that, before the cess ons, Congress had de*
cJared by the above resolution what disposition
should be made of them if ceded, and out of this
resolution no ingenuity can extract a declared de-
