HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 3 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have ordered the Fifth Corps to move down to Wright's support. He will at once organize a heavy column of assault from both corps, which i trust will break through the enemy's line. Hancock will press forward at the same time, and I trust Burnside will do the same. Everything is working well on the field by my reports.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 3.45 a. m.

General [HUMPHREYS]:

My troops are nearly formed. As it is misty I think I shall wait until it is a little more clear, by which time my troops will be formed. I have no artillery here. It has gone the other road, but I suppose my chief of artillery has placed it. I wish to have some here.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
