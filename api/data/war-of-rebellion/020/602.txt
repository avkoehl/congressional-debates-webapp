HDQRS. SIXTH BATTALION CAVALRY, SOUTH CAROLINA,Chisolmsville, September 4, 1862.

Lieutenant E. H. BARNWELL,

Asst. Adjt. General, Third Military District, Pocotaligo, S. C.:

LIEUTENANT: I beg to report the enemy advanced in one gunboat up to Field Point about 2 o'clock yesterday. The pickets secreted themselves on margin of bluff and waited until the steamer came up, dropped anchor, and was swinging around with the tide-distant some 90 yards from them-when, upon collection of crew on deck, they deliberately fired into them with rifles, creating much confusion and sudden dispersion. They (the pickets) are perfectly confident some were struck. The steamer then opening with her guns so rapidly they were obliged to fall back amid a shower of balls, shells, &amp;c., through an open field; all escaped unhurt. Subsequently three boat loads landed, but before two could reach the point, although I moved rapidly, the steamer had retired down river. Considerable firing occurred yesterday a.m. in vicinity of Hutchinson Island. I beg to inclose roster of battalion; also petition for Private Richardson to be forwarded.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. J. JEFFORDS,

Major Sixth Battalion Cavalry South Carolina, Commanding.
