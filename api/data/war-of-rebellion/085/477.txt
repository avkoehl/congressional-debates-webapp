have, however, directed General Steele to relieve the troops sent by you, and specially to return the cavalry and the detachment of the Seventeenth Corps under Colonel Moore, as soon as possible. Preparations to cross the Mississippi are still being made by the rebels, both on the east and west banks, by Buckner's force near Saint Joseph, La., and Scott's force at Brookhaven. From the reports of scouts and intercepted letters I learn that only Dick Taylor's (now Buckner's) force is ordered to cross. In this case the concentration at Monticello is intended for operations against General Steele's line and to cover Price's operations in Missouri.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, September 29, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The Sixty-fourth Illinois veterans ordered by you to Saint Louis will be immediately returned to General Sherman's command via Nashville. The diversion of any General Sherman's troops is contrary to the positive orders of General Grant.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

COLUMBUS, September 29, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The following just received. Will you please return this regiment immediately:

WASHINGTON, September 29, 1864-11.25 a. m.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

The sending of the Sixty-fourth Illinois veterans to Saint Louis is not approved. It is contrary to General Grant's positive orders to divert to other service any of General Sherman's troops.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

Major-General.

SPRINGFIELD, September 29, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Mayor of Belleville fears a raid and wants 600 stand of arms for home guards. Do you think a raid probable, and had I better send the arms?

RICHARD YATES,

Governor.

SAINT LOUIS, September 29, 1864-11.40 p. m.

His Excellency Governor YATES,

Springfield:

I think there is not much danger at Belleville. We have the timber patrolled, but it would not be amiss for the inhabitants to have a homeguard organization and some arms; 100 ought to suffice.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
