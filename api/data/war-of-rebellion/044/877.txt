SIR: All quiet in this city up to this hour, and, from all appearances, we do not apprehend any trouble to-morrow. We have, however, many applications for military forces to protect the people in adjoining counties from dangers apprehended from those opposed to the draft.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST, New York City, July 18, 1863.

SIR: Quiet and order prevailed in this city yesterday, last night, and this morning, and continues up to the present hour - 2 p. m. The rioters, it would appear, have generally returned to their ordinary occupations, and it is thought by those who seem to be best acquainted with the temper and feelings of the rioters, that they will not again disturb the peace and quiet of the city, unless the enforcement of the draft - temporarily suspended-should cause another effort to resist its execution, followed by burning and otherwise destroying the property of the city, and this example would, no doubt, be followed in the adjoining counties of the State. This gratifying result has been attained by unceasing efforts, night and day, with the very moderate force at command, when the emergency arose. I have received this morning from the War Department the order relieving me from the command of this department, and shall have great pleasure in turning over the command to Major-General Dix, with peace and order restored in this city. As my efforts have been unceasing and continual for more than two years past, in aiding to suppress the rebellion, I would respectfully ask of the Department at this time to be ordered to Troy, there to await orders, and for the purpose of preparing a detailed report of my proceedings while in command here, with the privilege of being accompanied with a portion of my staff. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
