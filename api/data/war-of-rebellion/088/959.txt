Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am about to make a move with my cavalry. It is of the utmost consequence that I have 800 Spencer rifles and 80,000 rounds of ammunition. The requisitions are long since in. May I ask you thus informally to see that I get them. Please notify me by telegram, so that I can make preparations as though I had them.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,September 21, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have received the following communication from Colonel Duncan, commanding Third Brigade, Third Division, colored troops, which I forward for your information, with the observation that is established beyond doubt that the rebels have put our soldiers to labor under their supposed masters when captured as prisoners of war, and some from this very brigade.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAMP AT DUTCH GAP, VA., September 21, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: Is it not established with sufficient certainty that the rebels have remitted to slavery, or otherwise put to hard labor, colored prisoners of war captured from us at Plymouth, Petersburg, and elsewhere, to warrant the use of rebel prisoners upon the work now in progress at Dutch Gap, where the shells of the enemy are beginning to tell with considerable effect upon our laboring soldiers? My men would take pleasure in acting as guards; would perform the duty, I think, with unusual pride and efficiency.

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,

SAMUEL A. DUNCAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
