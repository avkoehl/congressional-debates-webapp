Major-General McLAWS,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: In reference to my note of this morning conveying the orders of the commanding general not allow any destruction of the pontoons on the part of the enemy, I am directed now to say that, as many citizens are said to have returned to their residences inn town, you need not make any trouble the boats nor do anything to draw the fire of the enemy again upon the town. The people of that place have already suffered so much that it is the desire of the commanding general that they shall not again, for a trifle, be exposed to a similar affliction.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

[21.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
