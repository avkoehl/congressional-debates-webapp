siege howitzers, to throw grape, consider, and spherical-case shot. The howitzers are at the Citadel, but the carriages will have to be made. The detachment that fought the battery (a portion of Company D, of the artillery battalion) could serve it again, but as the company is well drilled at the exercise of heavy guns, you will, no doubt, require its services in the harbor. If authority could be obtained from the honor-able Secretary of the Confederate States Navy for me to enlist twenty-five seamen, four of which to rated petty officers, and Mr. Grimball and Ingraham could be assigned to me, I could take charge of the battery and perhaps make her useful.

Very respectfully,

J. R. HAMILTON,

Lieutenant, C. S. Navy.
