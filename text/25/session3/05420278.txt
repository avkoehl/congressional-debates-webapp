Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Smith.
Ho. or Reps.
been asserted for several years—that an officer,
with the title of " warden of the disputed terri-
tory" had claimed jurisdiction over the whole
territory in dispute pursuant to an understanding
between the two nations — that this had been
communicated to our Government at times when
at either had not been denied and repelled, or had
been neglected in a manner which had a tendency
to lead the Government of Great Bntain to sup-
pose there was such an understanding It was
known to the governments of Massachusetts and
Mame that the government of New Brunswick
did claim exclusive jurisdiction I then referred
to the recent proceedings in Maine. She had
sent an armed body of men to enter upon part of
this territory, and they were still in possession,
with a military force to sustain them This
measure I considered to be indiscreet, unfortu-
nate; that it had a tendency to produce the con-
sequences which have followed, it might embar-
rass the great question upon which negotiation
was going on between the two Governments, and
there was danger that it might precipitate us into
war. I did not speak disrespectfully of the char-
acter of the Governor of Mame, 01 call in ques
tion the purity of his motives, or piesent him in
contrast, in any respect whatever, favorable or
unfavorable, with the Lieutenant Governor of
New Brunswick
The part I have taken in this debate—this course
of remarks, it is said, will strengthen the claims
of a foreign Government against the rights of our
own In a question of this momentous import-
ance, are we not to inquire into the truth—to
state facts, and to reason upon them,fiom an
apprehension that what is here said may find its
way across the watpr, and have an injuiious in-
fluence abroad' Is fiee discussion to beiestrained
by such considerations' Is it not oui duty to
examine this gieat question fully ' To discuss
it fieelyf The moie important a question is,
the more emphatically this is our duty If we
cannot debate here with perfect fuedom, if facts
cannot be honestly stated and commented upon,
let us close our doors
But the immediate question is what is now to
be done > Shall Maine be lift aloni ' Must she
contind single handed ' No I snd she must
be piotected There has, in fact, been {io Mich
agieement for exclusive possession as that setup,
it is a misapprehension And 1 expressed my
belief that when the attention of the Biitish Gov
ernment should be railed to tin sub)i et, it would
so be found I did not think, thcicfoie, that war
would grow out of this contioveisy My oppo
sition to the bill was chiefly on account of the
second secdon, which authonzes the Pitsidciitto
raise an additional army I was icady to go foi
the rest of the bill, although I was inclined to
believe that the provisions of the act of 1795
weie sufficient
So much I have thought it my duty to say here
now, that I might not be misicprcsentcd here oi
elsewhere
MAINE BOUNDARY «.UIKTION
SPEECH OF HON. F. O. J. SMITH,
OF M4INE,
In the House of Representatives,
March 2, ]S39,
On the bill giving the President additional power for the
defense of the Uuited States, &c.
Mr SMITH said
Mr Chairman I participate of the anxiety
which I know to be common with the membeis
of the committee, and especially with the Repre-
sentatives of Mame upon this floor, that this
bill shall pass, and pass at the earliest moment
practicable
Tor one, sir, I feel but little concern as to the
particular shape which the bill shall assume in
becoming ajaw, if so it be that sufficient of the
sinews of war—of money and of arms—shall be
put by it at the command of the Executive of the
countiy, to maintain the rights and protect the
honor of thp citizens of Maine
If it shall be the pleasure of the committee and
House to put at the command of the Executive
only the militia of the country until Congress
shall again convene, superadded to the regular
Army now provided by law, I am contented If
it shall be the preference of the committee and
House to give him a laiger number of select
troops than now constitute the regular force of
the United States, instead of the militia alone,
so much the better But I repeat, my gieat anx-
iety is that enough of the one or the other of
these forces shall be granted to maintain the
rights of the State of Maine, and that enough of
the revenues of the Government shall be at the
control of the Executive to sustain those foices
under all emergencies that may occui Beyond
this, looking to the mere details of the bill, I feel
indifferent as to what may be the preference of
the House
Sir, I have listened to the debates of the com-
mittee upon this great subject with intense inter-
est, and determined to do so in silence on my part,
until persuaded that one view, and I believe the
true view, of the position in which Maine is now
placed, has been, in a measure, overlooked I
wish to call the attention of the committee to a
few simple and well substantiated facts, which
will lllustiate to oil, not only the lights of that
State, but the actual position m which she now
stands btfoie the country and the woild.m the de
fense of her n¿hts I am lejoiced at the unanim
lty with which several leading and fundamental
points in her case have bi en undi i stood and con-
ceded throughout the debates upon this floor It
is agietd, sir, upon all sides, that Mame is elenily
light in her claim or absolute title and piopetltj to the
whole ten Uoi y m dispute Your own lecoiils—the
records of this as welt as of the othei branch of
Congiess—place this fact high above dispuiation
on the paitof the Fedeial Government And your
records not only pi ove the claim of Maine to be
right m the abstract, but they piove aUo th< unal-
terable conviction of this Govt rnment thatii is not
involved in mystet 1/—that it is legible upon the fan
ot the countiy in dispute Allow me to lead to the
committee one of the resolutions parsed by this
sime Congress, at the lafet session, within this
11 ill, and passed imaiuirtoits/i/, as youi Journal

It is fuitht r agieod and conceded on all sidos,
and it is a fact alike beyond dispute upon youi
own Join nal, with that to which 1 have just ad-
veilcd, that Maine has been delayed in hei clam,
thus admitted to be right and just and on all
sidts, for jcais and yeais, by the Fedeial Gov
ernment The second resolution of this hi inch
of Congress, pissed upon th< subject at the late
session, and passed, too, wnaiumoits/i/, thus cstib
hshes this gi eat cause of complaint on the pai t of
Maine

further procrastination, tins House c mnotforbe u to oppress
in earnest deslíe that the pending negotiation should be
brought to a close, and the linal decision ot the ih pule be
made as early is practicable "
Sir, I do not desire to go behind these proofs,
to ask where, or upon whom, falls most largely
the blame of thus delaying Maine in the realiza-
tion and enjoymentof her acknowledged lights for
yeais and years I am content to have it brought
home to the sense of this committee and of the
country, at this juncture, that Mune plants hei-
self, at the onset, in demanding the strong aim
of this gieat Republic foi hei support, upon two
indisputable facts
1st That her claim is a righteous one, and of
no difficult ascertainment
2d That she has been unjustly delayed for
years and yeais by the Federal Government, as
well as by Great Britain, in tne adjustment and
enjoyment of it
I proceed now, sir, to call the attention of the
committee and of the country to the position
which Maine has taken in refeicnce to her terri-
tory, and with arms in hand is determined to
maintain, and the authouty which she has fiom
this Government foi that position Her Hue lc-
latlons to this Government, as now put foith in
her present position,appear to have been, to some
considerable extent, oveilooked in this debate,
and I wish it to be understood distinctly, for one,
that I vote for the bill bcfoie you in rcfeunce to
the position which Maine occupies, in fact, at
this moment, and which she his the undoubted
authority of this Government foi occupying, and
that I do not vote foi it with a view of secuung
to the State the support of the Ft deral Govern-
ment in reference to any new position which has
been marked out for her by others In a word,
sir, if the bill is to be executed when passed into
a law, only to sustain Maine in her rights to the
extent of the recent protocol, or arrangement,
made for her by the Executive of the General
Government, thi ough the Secretary of State, with
the British Minister, then, 811, I do not hesitate
to say that I am opposed to it, and would never
give my vote foi it I would ícsist it as a viola-
tion of the lights of Maine, ckarly evpressed
and di fined upon the recoidsof this, Government,
I would tn at it as an abandonment of Maine to
shame and dishonor, in the hour of her pen! and
conflict with a toieign Powei
If the bill is  to  be thus construed, it forces
Minie fiom the righteous stand she has taken,
ot leaves her to maintain htiself by hei own arms
alone     I claim to have that State piotoctidand
defended, thiough this bill, to the full extent of
hi r present position and untlei taking, and 011 the
giound that in nothing has she acted beyond the
express wan ant of the only undei standing winch
j hail hi en entered into between the United States
I and the BiUish Government on the subject of the
I disputed umtoiy, and to givern the pautes im-
