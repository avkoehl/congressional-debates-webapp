THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 14,
mated in the report of the Department of
Agriculture, was, in bushels:
1865. Wheat. Com.
Illinois  25,386,745 177,095,852
Indiana  13,020.803 116.069.318
Iowa  13,698,542 62,997,813
Michigan s.    16,378,488 17,520,305
Minnesota  3,425,467 5,577,795
Missouri  2,953.363 52,021,715
Ohio  17,601,472 91,119,644
Wisconsin    20,307,920 13,449,405
Total  112,752,800 535,851,845
For the whole country the estimates were—
wheat 148,622,827 bushels,andcorn 704,427,853
bushels.
For the five States of Illinois, Iowa, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, iu 1865, the
amounts are of wheat 79,077,102 bushels, and
of corn 276,641,170 bushels.
Now, putting these figures together, it ap-
pears that in 1859 the eight northwestern States
had less than three tenths of the population
of the Republic—that is to say, only 8,955,932
out of 31,443,322—and yet in 1865 the same
States produced three fourths of the corn and
more than three fourths of the wheat.
It also appears that the five States of Illi-
nois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wiscon-
sin, ill the year 1859, had only a trifle more
than one eighth of the population of the coun-
try, and yet in 1865 they produced more than
half of the wheat and almost half of the corn.
It would be superfluous to comment upon fig-
ures like these. And that there is still rooc^
for indefinite expansion we cannot doubt if we
consider the fact that in 1859 the agricultural
area of the country embraced only 163,110,720
acres, while the gros3 aggregate of unculti-
vated land, fertile and waste, was ten times as
much; that is to say, 1,460,969,802 acres.
The wheat shipped from Lake Michigan east-
ward is a part of our surplus contributed to
the aggregate product of the country, from
which, after supplying those of our own States,
whose consumption exceeds their production,
is drawn the surplus which we export to for-
eign countries.
The aggregate export of wheat and flour
from the United States in the three years 1861,
1862, and 1863 was 124,828,902 bushels ; and
in those years the shipments from Milwaukee,
Chicago, Green Bay, Port Washington, She-
boygan, Kenosha, and Racine, on the west-
ern shore of Lake Michigan, amounted to
123,231,981 bushels; and this wheat was almost
wholly the product of Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa, and northern Illinois. It would be diffi-
cult to overestimate the extent to which, in
the peculiar situation of the country during
these years, the national credit was invigorated
by those exportations.
Meantime southern Illinois, Missouri, and
Iowa supplied most of the flour consumed in
Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, and a part
of Nebraska. And during the same three
years Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota,
and Missouri actually shipped eastward one
hundred and fifty per cent, more corn and meal
and twenty-five per cent, more pork than the
whole Republic exported during the same pe-
riod. Their aggregate contributions to the
national surplus, which furnished our exports
during those three years, amounted to $205,-'
726,700. But the entire exports of domestic
produce for the same time, exclusive of gold
and silver, amounted to only $669,032,450.
The surplus of wheat, corn, and pork sent east-
ward from these five States was thus almost
one third of the entire exportation of the Uni-
ted States.
The average yearly tonnage of all vessels of
all nations engaged in transoceanic commerce
in the same three years and entering the ports
of the United States was 5,311,867 tons. The
wheat, corn, beef, and pork contributed by
these five States to our foreign exports averaged
not less than 1,250,000 tons per annum. These
shipments, therefore, which equaled the entire
exportation of these products and one third
of the aggregate exports of afl our domestic
products, except gold and silver, actually fur-
nished outward-bound employment to one
fourth of all the tonnage of all nations trading
across the sea from. American ports.
The Agricultural Report for 1865 places Illi-
nois in the front rank of the wheat-producing
States, looking not to population but only the
number of bushels raised. Her crop exceeds
twenty-five millions. Next comes Wisconsin,
with a crop of over twenty millions. Ohio is
third, Michigan fourth, Iowa fifth, and Indiana
sixth. And as for corn, Illinois alone produces
several million bushels more than Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Kentucky all
together.
In 1859 the aggregate product of wheat in
the States and Territories was five and one
half bushels to each inhabitant. New England
produced only eleven and one half quarts to
each inhabitant. The middle States produced
three and two thirds bushels to each inhabit-
ant. The southern States produced three and
one half bushels to each inhabitant. But the
western States produced ten bushels to each
inhabitant; and one of them, Wisconsin, pro-
produced more than twenty bushels for each
man, woman, and child within her borders.
In 1859 the single State of Illinois produced,
.according to the census returns, 23,837,023
bushels of wheat, and yet the whole amount
exported to foreign countries in the same year
was only 17,213,133 bushels. In the same year
she produced 115,174,177 bushels of corn, and
the entire export of that year amounted to only
15,448,507 bushels. The first shipment of
grain from Lake Michigan of which we have
any record was one of 3,000 bushels of wheat,
made in 1836, by the brig John H. Kenzie,
from Grand Haven to Buffalo. The first ship-
ment of grain from the western shore of that
lake was made from Chicago in 1838, and con-
sisted of thirty-nine bags of wheat. The first
shipment of grain from Wisconsin was made
in 1841, at Milwaukee, where a cargo of about
4,000 bushels of wheat was sent to Canada.
But the shipments of grain and flour from ports
of Lake Michigan were, in 1858, 27,879,293
bushels; in 1859, 25,829,753 bushels; in 1860,
43,211,448 bushels; in 18G1, 69,489,113 bush-
els; in 1862, 78,218,675bushels; and in 1863,
74,710,664 bushels.
The magnitude of the agricultural interest of
the Northwest is shown in a striking mauner by
the figures, which exhibit the extent to which
it furnishes business for the railway lines of this
country. The repoit of the Milwaukee and
St. Paul railway for 1865 shows that the amount
of wheat and flour transported on that road
in that year was 6,286,834 bushels and 271,000
barrels, amounting to 214,623 tons. But the
entire tonnage of freight for that year was only
319,650 tons ; so that the single article of wheat,
ground and unground, contributed more than
two thirds of all its freight. And yet during
the same year the road also carried for the farm-
ers of the Northwest 74,970 bushels of rye,
oats, and barley, 18,425 bushels of corn, 18,797
bushels of potatoes, 10,580 head of cattle,
4,442 live hogs, 2,258,590 pounds of dressed
hogs, 810,970 pounds of wool, and 2,156,190
pounds of hides.
The report of the same road for 1866 shows
the amount of wheat and flour transported
in 1866 to have been 5,945,948 bushels, and
305,685 barrels, or 208,139 tons. But the en-
tire freight was only 361,687 tons ; the wheat
alone, therefore, contributed more than one
half the freight.
The report of the Milwaukee and Prairie du
Chien railway for the year 1866 shows that
in that year it transported 5,724,051 bushels of
wheat and 179,779 barrels of flour, amounting
in the aggregate to 189,334 tons, or more than
one half the entire freight for the year, which
was only 369,320 tons. In addition to this
ground and unground wheat, the road trans-
ported other agricultural products in large
quantities, including 170,525 bushels of rye,
29,661 bushels of barley, 995,148 bushels of
oats, 383,957 bushels of corn, 55,300 buslfels
of potatoes, 20,505,740 pounds of dressed hogs,
1,218,915 pounds of butter, 680,220 pounds of
wool, 1,469,920 pounds of hides, 13,887 head
of cattle, and 36,195 head of hogs.
The same report shows that on the McGregor
Western road in 1806, of a freight business of
60,589 tons, the single article of wheat, ground
and unground, furnished 35,466 tons, or more
than seven twelfths.
The reports of the Chicago and Northwest-
ern railway show that the entire freight reve-
nue of that road in 1864 was $4,448,598 57,
of which grain and meat furnished $2,193,-
953 08; that in 1865 the entire revenue from
freight was $5,7-44,895 57, of which grain and
meat furnished $2,812,042 75; that in 1806 its
entire revenue from freight was $6,649,589 81,
of which grain and meat paid <j2,799,273 80.
Having presented these facts, indicative of
the present development of the agriculture of
the Northwest and suggestive of its indefinite
expansion in the future, I will proceed to show
how grievously it is.crippled and hampered by
inadequate facilities of transportation to its
markets. The history of these States having
demonstrated theiragricultural productiveness,
their prosperity hinges altogether upon the ques-
tion of transportation. If this transportation
shall keep pace in its expansion with our in-
creasing production, then will our prosperity
continue. If our means of transportation shall
at the same time become better and cheaper as
well as greater, then will ourprosperity increase.
It will increase, too, in proportion to the relative
improvement of these facilities for reaching our
legitimate markets. If the enlargement of these
facilities shall not keep pace with our agricul-
tural development our interests must languish,
and in proportion to their inadequacy must we
suffer. To the agricultural producer whose
surplus does not find a market at his own door
the question of transportation is a question of
life or death. And where is the present market
for the surplus grain and meat of those north-
western States? First, we must look for it to
those States ar.d Territories whose consumption
exceeds their production, and next to foreign
countries. The States which purchase most
from us are the New England and the Middle
States. New York city, therefore, virtually
conducts the distribution of these products to
purchasers within the Republic as well as their
exportation to foreign countries. New York,
a mere -cipher in our lumber market, is the
mistress of our grain and meat markets, and
at present our transportation lines must mainly
tend toward that city, while for our export
trade we ought to have, if possible, an unob-
structed route to Europe.
I could comprehend the present condition
of things if in this matter of transportation the
interests of agriculture antagonized with those
of manufactures. Then I should expcct manu-
facturers to stand across our track. But iu
this case, where manufactures will gain as much
by cheaper food as agriculture can gain by
cheaper transportation, I am amazed at the
temerity of local interests seeking to fetter the
whole Northwest, and ashamed that we so
patiently submit to it. New York produced in
1865, in round numbers, 12,000,000 bushels of
wheat, and Wisconsin produced 20,000,000
bushels; and yet New York received for
her wheat $26,000,000, while Wisconsin re-
ceived only $22,000,000. New York received
$4,000,000 more for 12,000,000 bushels than
Wisconsin received for 20,000,000 buchcls.
Thatis to say, Wisconsin virtually paid 8,000,000
bushels of wheat and $4,000,000 in money to
get the remaining 12,000,000 bushels of wheat
to market. Pennsylvania realized $23,000,000
for her crop of 11,000,000 bushels, while Iowa
for her crop of 13,000,000 bushels realized only
$13,000,000. Pennsylvaniaproduced2,000,000
bushels less wheat, but realized $10,000,000
more money. Minnesota produced three times
as much wheat as New Jersey, and yet New
Jersey realized $200,000 more for her crop than
