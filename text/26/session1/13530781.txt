truth ihere, advancing tn life, his own experience teaches him
thai it" the truth, and it become! at last incorporated with our
thoughts as a settled maxim
Ereiy defalcauon, howeTer, it is proper to remark, is not
in embeulement, in the latter there la a felonious in.
tent, it is stealing, except that there is not a compli-
ance with the technical lequisite of taking. I will not
attempt to graduate the criminality ef these offences; but
in cue  of defalcation, it often happens, perheps mo3t fre
qmntly, that there is no felonious intention, that is.no inten-
tion hnally to deprive the owner of his property. The delin-
quent, under the influence of strong temptation—his own ne-
cessities—* prospect of advantage—the solicitation of fi tendá-
is induced to violate his trust; he persuades himself that he is
doing no wrong, for he is convinced that he will be able to re-
turn the deposite in due time It at such a moment he could
be mide to feel that he will never be able to restore what he
tares, he would probably abstain from taking it. But with no
human eye to see him, assured of secrecy, and deluded into
¿« belief that no harm will be done, ho yields to a temptation
whose cnminalitv he does not sufficiently perceive. There is
oa this account the greater snare, and the greater danger Good
men are betrayed by it to their rum; character is no adequate
security.
Now let us examine the evidence—we begin with that fur-
nished by our own statements, first let us turn to document
jin lOJfurni-hed to us at the present session by the Secretary
 f the Treasury. The tables in that document only come down
to the year 1836, inclusive, the total number of defaul'ers in
page 8 is two thousand seven hundred and sixty, m that class
An immense number, it must lie admitted, and an appalling
lUtementfor those who would cenfide the whole treasure of
the United State* to individual keeping The total loss is
$4956,573 5b, "loss per head" (for the Secretary puts it down
u if be were numbering cattle) in the civil department 83 6M5,
in the military and naval department 81,613, and this, after al-
lowing «-deduction of 20 per cent fur credits they might pro-
tah'y show themselves to be entitled to The table just re-
Jsrredto Is of disbursing officers, the next table, No 2, is of
collector*, a sort ol sub-treasurets, confided in for keeping the
public moneys, as the sub treasurers are to be under this act.
To* number of defaulters is 387; the total loss «2,033,549 81, not
Including, however, the defalcation of Swartwout, which is a
million and a quarter more. " The loss per head" is «5,737
Ws next come to the accounts of postmasters, in page 15, who
art also a sort of sub-treasurers, and here we find a large list of
defaulters: the total number is not less than 626; the total
amount of default «377,493 56, and certainly we can derive no
hope of improvement from our most recent experience, on the
contrary, the last is the worst. Of the total amount of the de-
fault of postmasters, «142,250 43, occurred in the four years,
from 1833 to 1836, inclusive The grand total, adding Mr
Pwattwout's default, is no less than «8,622,616' From another
document it appears that the delinquent receivers from the
«alesof the public lands are 66. This table will be found in
the report of a committee of this House at the session of 183',
'J9, No 313, vo1. 2, page 143 Surely these things have not
buen fully weighed, nor the admonition duly considered by those
who would recommend the extension of individual confidence
in the keeping ef the public money
Yet this is only a part of the evidence. I mean of the evi-
dence we have before us, in our own proceedings, testified by
our own document, and constantly in our sight. In the year
1817 occurred the case of Theron Kudd, clerk of the district
court of the district of New York, or of one of the distric 8 in
that State. He was a Sub Treasurer, for he had the custody of
the treasure belonging to the suitors in that court, public and
private At lius time he had received into his hands, in the
course of three or four years, a large sum of money, partly be-
longing to the United States, and partly to private suitors. It
was not forthcoming In the year ISIS a committee of this
Home made a report upon the subject, No. 138 1st session 15th
Congress In that report the ficta are fully stated. I will not
take up the time of the committee with reading it at length, but
will only bring to your view the concluding sentence "By all
which it doth appear to your committee that the funds of the
court have not oeen faithfully applied, but that they have been
most grossly and nefariously purloined " The amount due to
the United States of the money thus purloined, was «64,906 15,
to private claimants «52,486, making a total of «117,307 01
This, it will be borne in mind, was the case of a public officer,
appointed under the authority of the United States By ar d
by I will show hew the recurrence of such purloi ung was pro-
vided against. Then we had a defalcation by a clerk of this
House In both the instances thus stated, the Treasury of the
United States was the sufferer The accounts furnished to us
do not show the extent of defalcation among depositaries of this
description They are, therefore, a very inadequate representa-
uon, large as the sum is of the total loss sustained by the Trea-
inryofihe United otates. Then it will be recollected we had ¡ 
defalcation by the sergeant at arms of this H >usr Have these
things been duly considered, in framing the present hill? They
go to the very neart ot it—they show it to be founded upon a
tal  theory, contra licted by our own experience, as well as the
experience of mankind
But there is still much more evidence, far more than can be
known to any lmiiv dual, and far more than, if I knew it all, it
would be possible to bung before you 'It is not uncommon,"
is the dictionary tells us, "for men entrusted with the public
money, to embezzle it " It is so common, as you hive seen,
that ihe history is loo long to be read, or to be listened t > Some
of the evidenee, however, I can vouch, and for the great remain-
der, must refer to those who will task their recollection Doubt-
less there ii no man present who has not known of instances I
can refer only to a very small part. I beam with Pennsylvania
The most s nking and instructive instance tl ere happens also,
tab  one of erear notoriety It is the case of John Nicholson
In the year 17S4, according to my recollection, Mr Nicholson
was aclerk inoneof the public offices in Pennsylvania He re-
commended himself to nouoe by his integrity, hisassiduity, and
hli capacity. About the period just mentioned, he framed a
Jaw far establishing the accounting department of the Common-
wealth, which m t with the legislative sancuon, and he was
appointed by the Legislature to be Comptroller. He enjoyed
. the highest confidence, and for a long time I really believe he
deserved it. But, unfortunately for mm, and for the Common-
wealth too, too much was confided to htm He was entrusted
with the public money, and with public securities In less than
ten years he was found to be a defaulter to an amount exceed-
ing considerably one hunted thousand dollars. Judgment*
wen obtained agauMl bimW the State; and out of them have
arisen still continuing controversies, reaching gieat nurobersof
persons, but known by his name The remainder of his history
it is not material to revert te Then, at a subsequent period, we
had a dclinquenttreisurcr, his name I need not mention The
case will be found in soma of the books of reports
Wl have had instances, too, not of so public a nature, but
equally demonstrative of the insufficiency and the danger of in
dividual conhJence In the Northern Liberties Bank there waa
an individual employed only as a clerk or bookkeeper, but,
from the excellence of h s character and hie uncommon quaiifi
canons, almost en rus ed with the entire management For
himself and for his friends, ir violation of his trust, under the
influence of temptation, lie withdrew nearly hall the capital of
the bank In this st He things were when the directors first dis-
covered hisdelinqutncy We had also a recent instance in the
Schuylnii Bank We ha! a case of a railroad company, in
which the President appropriated to his own use the means of
the company to the amount, I think, of four hundred thousand
dollars The=e are all instances in which confidence reposed
in indmduals was betrayed They are instances, too, in which
the individuals were deemed worthy of the confidence I do
not doubt that thev were in the beginning They were mined
by the confidence placed in them
"1 now como to some very memorable and painful cases,
whichhaveoccurredin the State of Virginia, and made a deep
a.id permanent impression Important as they are, still, if I
thought there were wounds that would be opened by reviving
the recollection ot ihem, I would abstain from doing so; but 1
am told th-it, after this length of time, there is no danger on this
score The first of these was the case of General Preston, a
treasurer of Virzima I will give the account of it from a paper
which lies before me, furnia ied by a gentleman well acquainted
with the whole matter
General John Preston was first appointed Treasurer of Vir-
ginia by the Executive, in the recess of ihe Legislature, in Oc-
tober, IS08 He wis reappointed by the Legislature to the of-
fice in Januaiy, 18Ü9 and thenceforth, successively every year
till January, 1819, when lerinan Baker was appointed his suc-
cessor Of Gen Pie-ton's malversation in office, no suspicion
had arisen in any quarter till about Christmas, 1818 He had
been, previously, always and universally esteemed a man of
spotless integrity and honor He was one of a numerous fami-
ly of the most respectable people in Virginia, all ol whem,
with the exception of himself, are yet without a stain He was
a man in easy circumstances, of simple and frugal habits, and
apparently free from the dominion of any strong passion what-
ever, and trom every vie  that could offend against good morals
or good manners He wd«, 1 should think, at the termination
of his public service as treasurer, about 65 years of age The
detection of his d falcation came upon the public like a clap of
thunder in a cloudless day
The amount of the slehc it in the Treasury, at the time he
went out ol office, was $132 588 of public money entrusted to
his safekseping, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, in addl
tion. there weie entrusted to his own care «50,000 of money
belongms to the literary fund, which had been put under ihe
management of commissioners who had appointed him trea-
surer of ,he fund, so that the whole amount of the defalcation
was SI -2,533 Ol this sum, it appeared he had vested in real
estate, or otherwise, about «90 000, what he did with the rest
has never been explained, and is still a mystery His malver-
sation commenced no doubt many years before the detection of
it, but it was unimportant, in the suit against his sureties,
which was bi ought by the Commonwealth, to asceitam when
oi how it commenced, or the history of its progress, and, there-
fore, I can give you no information as to this particular A
ju igment was recovered against his sureties, in his official bend,
for the amount of the deficit in the Treasury of the Common-
wealth, exclusive of the amount of the deficit in the literary
fund, (which, in fact, was not discovered till afterwards,) and his
own property was sold to make good the deficit; but the pro-
ceeds of his own effeits fell short of the amount, and a large
balance was paid by his sureties.
Buring the whole time of the continuance of Gen Preston in
office, the state of the treasury was every year examined by a
eomrmttee of the Legislature, and reported tobe in all respect*
fair and regular The absence of all suspicion produced a
vtant of care in making these yearly examinations, which ena-
bled the treasuier somehow or other to conceal his malver-
sations
So much for tho case of General Preston. His successor,
Jerman Bil er, was, at the time he was first appointed to the
office, about forty four vears of age He, too, like his prede
censor, was a miri of the fairest character, but he was n t, like
him in easy circumstance , on tltecontrary, he was much em-
barrassed by debt He continued in office till the 28th March,
\82&, when he died bv his own hand. An examination of the
state of the Treasury bv a committee of the Executive council
hai been appointed to be made on ihe 1st April, he knew fiom
acoiimumcatinn made to him by one of the committee that
the examination must lead to a detection of his embezzlement,
and he anticipated the diszrace by sun ide The total amount
of his embezzlement was little over «33 000 The exact man
ner in which he commrted the embezzlements was distinctly
ascertained, as we I as the manner in which he h id contrived
to conceal them from the investigating committee of the Legis-
lature and of the.Exeetitive council, ami this appeared so sim
pie, so open to view, that it was wonderful how it could have
failed to attnet attention, but the same unbounded confi'ente
was reposed in bim as in all his prcde essors, and no man ima-
gining the p>3=ibility of embezzlement, seno man took the least
pa ns to detect one
Now if our confi 'ence should be asked in the officers to be
appotnttd under tl is act, on account of the hieh source from
which th y aieto derive the appointment, I answer that it is i ot
lusher than in the un'ortunate cases last referred to Those
officers were appointed by the Legislature of Virginia, and
I would siy further, what no man can dispute, that the means
of information possessed by that I egislature were far better
than the Cxecum e of the United States can ever have They
pinbably kne.v the men, many of them personally, which can
rarely happen to the Pres dent Their selection shows ihat
they were wel' q jalified ti make it, for they appointed men of
the very first character in the ¡state It must rot be forgctten
in addiimn to a'l these considera ions, that the President of the
United States has not the whole Union to select from; he makes
his appointments fiom his party Neither are examinations to
be relied upon, they were periodically made in Virginia by com-
mittees appointed for the purpose, and were far more substan-
tia in all respects than the colnrable examinations directed by
thf* bill.   Yet they pioved unavailing; and, «till further, the
character of any officer who may be appointed under this bill
can never offer a hwher pledge, or be a better security, thai
was afforded by Generil Preston or Mr Baker.
These instances have made a deep and permanent impres-
sion in Virginia; it Is not to be wondered at that Virginia is
opposed to the Sub Treasury I call upon the Representatives
of that State to speak her sentiments here I am contending,
not for triumph, but for truth, and will not believe it to be lu
vain In that same State there is a still more recent case, oc-
curring in one of her banks, and marked by the circumstance
that the delinquent was a man of high character, and enjoying
unbounded confidence Yet he too proved himself unworthy
of the griat confi lence reposed in him And here 1 would re-
mark that this question of personal confiderce is precisely the
same, whethei it occur in hanks or elsewheie It is personal
confidence that is to be reposed by this bill, ol the same kind,
exposed to the same tempta ions, and involving the same risks
as the instances which have now been de ailed I appeal, then,
to every member of ihis committee, whethei it is wise, or con-
sistent with just morality, to create such temptations and to in-
cur such risks I appeal esp-cially, as I said hefore, to the
members from Virginia, because they know full well the pain,
and suffenne, and loss of character inflic ted by the delinquency
of the individuáis who have been named.
The evidence does not step here, it goes much further, and
to my mind is quite conclusive. When the security for per-
sonal confidence has b°en betrayed or failed, and thus proved
insufficient, what has bten at last resorted to; not in one State,
but universally 1 The very reverse of that which this bill pro-
poses The use of mdiv ldual depositaries, and the reliance
upon personal confi lence, have been abandoned, condemned as
unfit to be trustel to, and the veiy opposite method employed.
This bill, by asingu'ar contradiction to the universal decision
founded upon experience, goes back to thit which, having be<n
tried and found wanting, has been condemned and abandoned.
What was done by Congress with regard to those sub treasurers
of courts with whom the money of suitors hss been deposited, as
in the instance of Theron Rudd,in New York? By an act of the
3d of Marc i, 1817, It was enacted and provided that thty should
no loneer be trusted When that subject was under discussion,
I recollect that we, who are from Pennsylvania, were gratified
to find that an adequate provision had early been mad* m the
courts of that district affording perfect security, and furnishing
a model for the legislation  f Congress. The learned judge of
that court, the late Judge Peters, had boen in the public civilser-
vice during the war of the Revolution, was the associate of the
men who oreamzed our Government under the Constitution,
and was well acquainted, no doubt, with the arrangement of the
Treasury What did he do? By a rule of ihat court, no money
was left in the hands of the clerk, (though a manas worthy of
confidence aB any man,) nor subject to his power It was or-
dered to be placed In bank, to the credit of the court, in the cause
on account of which it was paid in, and could only be paid out
upon the order of the court, certified by the clerk, under the
court'sseal. This was a perfect check, and not a dollar was ever
lost in that district The same plan precisely is adopted in the
act r f the 3d of March, 1817, as the law of all our courts It is
still the law, it has been found, as far as I know, to be effectual
No less has since been sustained, but what is more material
this law is a legislative declaration by Congress that persona'
responsihilitvie not to be relied on, as experience had shown.
If it be'true, as the existence of this act affirms, that the com-
paratively small amounts lodged in the courts of the United
States cannot be safely entrusted to individual depositaries,
how is it possible that any man in his right mind can affirm
that the wnole treasure of the United States may be so en-
trusted?
What was done m Virginia? The case of Baker induced the
Legislature to make a new organization of the Treasury De-
partment Before that time, the law required all public money
to be paid directly to the Treasurer, and though he was required
to deposite such portions of it as he should think not necessary
to be kept in the Treasury office, in the two banks of Virginia
at Richmond, yet he deposited in the banks, and kept in the of-
fice only such portions of the public money as he deemed con-
venient, and payments to the public creditors were made by
him, either out of the moneys kept in the Treasury office, or by
checks on the banks, as he thought pn per The accounts kej t
by the banks were accounts between them and the Treasurer;
they were accountable to him alone, and he alone accountable to
the Commonwealth. All accounts of moneys due to or from Ihe
Commonwealth were settled in the Auditor's office, and money*
were received into the Treasury, or paid out of it, upon War
rants of the Auditor, whose books were thus a check upon the
accounts of the Treasurer, but not upon his disposition of the
public money
The new organization made in consequence of Baker's case
is such that in truth, not ene dollar of public money is ever en-
trusted to the safekeeping of the treasurer That officer is a
mere clerk to keep the cash accounts of the public treasury.
The scheme is simply this every collector ef public money,
every person indebted to the public on any account, presents
his account to the First or the Second Au litor, accordme to the
character of the fund to which the money belongs The au-
ditor, having as-eitainedthe amountpistly due, gives an order
on the treasurer to receive the money from the debtor, upon
which the treasurer endorses an ori'er, thit the debtor shall pay
it into one of the banks at Richmond The debtor bringsthe
treasurer a receipt for it fiom the bank, the treasurer then
gives him a receipt for it, which he carries to the auditor, who,
thereupon, gives him an acquittance, and when money is paid
fr>m the treasnry, the auditor eettles the claim, end gives the
public creditor an order on the treasurer for ihe amount due;
upon which ihe treasuier endorsees check on one of the bank ,
and takes a leceipt from ihe creditor for the amount No
money can be paid into the treasury, or out of it, in any other
way.
These arrang -nents have proved efficient I call again upon
the members of this House, and especially upon the members
from Viramia, to say why they will depait from it to return to
a plan already tried until us utter failure was proved? Why
will they not listen to the voice of the Congress of the United
Stales deliberately ad Iressed to them? Why will they not
lisien to the voice of Virginia, speaking to them *o ernphati-
callvl But, powerful as it is, we have not yet done with the
evidence What do we all do? What do lrilividuals. do for
the safekeeping of their money? Here and ihere one may be
found who, perhaps, from some humor, (commonly deemed a
very foolish one,) or some weak fear, keeps his treasure in hi*
house    The next thing you hear is of a robbery—perhaps a
