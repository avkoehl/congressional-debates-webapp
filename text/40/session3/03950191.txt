development of our railroad system. I do not
refer alone to the direct influence upon those
who come to find work in the actual construc-
tion of our roads, but to the indirect and far
wider influence exerted upon those who come
to make homes for themselves and their chil-
dren upon our public domain, which railroads
open for settlement and bring within reach of
markets.
It may be instructive to notice for a mo-
ment how immigration has kept pace with rail-
way development in this country:

From 1840 to 1850  5,289 1,558.300
From 1850 to 1860   21,295 2,707,624
Thus it will be seen that prior to the railroad
era immigration was very small, and that dur-
ing the last decade (the period of greatest rail-
way development) immigration correspond-
ingly increased. Since 18G3 the average number
has been about three hundred thousand per
annum. It is not difficult to understand why,
in a country like ours, this correspondence
between the increase of railways and immigra-
tion should exist. Had it not been for the
facilities they afford the lands in the vicinity
of water communication would have all been
occupied, and those at a distance would
have been worthless. The immigrant would
have had none of the inducements to come
here which are now presented to him. In fact,
without railroads Chicago and most of the
other great cities of the VVest would be only
second-class villages, and Minnesota, Iowa,
and Wisconsin would, to a great extent, be
Indian hunting-grounds. It is because rail-
roads annihilate the distance between cheap
lands and good markets, and thus enable the
farmer to dispose readily of his products, that
the people of the Old World are so anxious to
make homes among us. It is for that reason
that among the people of my own State to-
day will be found more than a hundred thou-
sand hardy, honest, industrious Germans,
Norwegians, and Swedes, who rank among
the best farmers of the State.
Of course no mathematical estimate can be
made of the money value of these immigrants
to our country, but it is usually placed at about
one thousand dollars per head. This estimate
is based upon the assumption that each free
person adds as much to the wealth of the nation
as the former slave did to his master—an
assumption evidently unjust to the free citizen.
But iu order that my calculation may be beyond
the reach of cavil, I will estimate the money
value of each immigrant at only $500, which
will give an aggregate increase of national
wealth from this source alone of $750,000,000
within the last five years. It is also stated by
John A. Kennedy, formerly superintendent of
the Castle Garden immigration depot in New
York, that "a careful inquiry, extending over
a period of seventeen months, gave an average
of$100 (almost entirely in coin) as the money
property of each man, woman, and child"
landed at New York. At this estimate, the
amount of gold and silver added to the circu-
lation of this country every year since 1863 is
about thirty million dollars, or the enormous
sum of §150,000,000 in five years. Add this
to the increase just mentioned and we have
$900,000,000 as the result of immigration dur-
ing that time—a sum much greater than the
entire estimated wealth of the United States in
1700. Dr. Engel, the Prussian statistician, says:
"Estimated in money, the Prussian State hus lost
during sixteen yeais, by an excess of 180,994 emi-
grants over immigrants, a sum of more thun one hun-
dred and eighty million thaler?. It must be added that
those who arc resolved to try then-strength abroad
are by no means our weakest elements; their contin-
uous stream may be compared to a well-equipped
army, which, leaving the country annually, is, after
having crossed the frontier, lost to it forever.
Says Dr. Engel:
"A ship loaded with emigrants is often lookedupon
as ail object of compassion; it is nevertheless, m a
politico-economical point of view, generally^morc
valuable than the richest cargo of sold dust.
What Prussia lias thus lost we
But why will the Northern Pacific railroad
prove peculiarly valuable iu stimulating immi-
gration? First, because it will open to settle-
ment the best portion of the public domain;
second, because it will influence the best class
of immigrants, by offering them the kind of
lands they want, and in the climate they pre-
fer. This human tide whieh sets toward our
shores instinctively follows its own parallels
of latitude. That part of Europe which lies
north of the forty-eighth degree of north lati-
tude has furnished, probably, four fifths of the
foreign population now an the United States,
and very much the greater part of that pop-
ulation came from Norway, Sweden, Prussia,
and other parts of northern Germany, all of
which countries lie north of latitude fifty
degrees.
An immigrant from Spain, Portugal. Turkey,
Italy, or any of the countries south of the forty-
eighth degree would be a" curiosity to the peo-
ple of the Northwest, except that they may
have occasionally made the acquaintance of
some gentleman from the latter country, as he
plied tlie enterprising avocation of "organ
grinder." The intelligence, the energy, the
thrift, the money, and the progress, all conic
from northern Europe, and from a parallel of
latitude further north than the line of this road.
The census reports show, also, that but few of
this class of immigrants seek the southern por-
tions of the United States. The construction
of this road will open up a vast extent of fertile
territory, which, in climate and natural pro-
ductions, exactly meets the wauts of the popu-
lations of northern Europe, and hence it will
exert a most powerful influence upon them.
Lettho Northern Pacificrailwayand the home-
stead law march hand in hand across the con-
tinent, and in less than a decadc you will see
along its line at least two millions of the liardy
farmers, miners, and mechanics of northern
Europe, in whom alone the Government will
find an increase of wealth a hundredfold
greater than the cost of the road, and who
will bring with them enough gold and silver to
pay five times over the amount of the proposed
loan. If the United States are to advance in
wealth in the future as they have done in the
past, we must keep wide open the doors to
those people who bring with them, and who
dig from our soil, so large a proportion of this
wealth. And as no other road can, for the
obvious reasons just named, supply the induce-
ments to immigration which will be afforded
by the Northern Pacific, it seems to me that
this alone is conclusive as to the merits of its
claim for aid.
'2. It will be the means of developing, our
agricultural and mineral resources.
' We are sometimes told that " this is doubt-
less a meritorious and beneficent enterprise,
but the Government cannot, afford to aid it be-
cause of our immense national debt." We have
already seen what other nations similarly situ-
ated have done, and how the results have dem-
onstrated their wisdom. Let us now examine
this objection by the light of the facts aloue,
unbiased by their example.
It is true our debt is large, but our resources
are also immense. The true way to pay the
former is to develop the latter.
The farmer who should refuse to incur the
expense of plowing and sowing his fields be-
cause he is in debt would be voted an idiot by
all his neighbors. Wherein does he differ from
the statesman who, aware of the inexhaustible
wealth of our soil and of the countless treasures
that crop out 011 almost every mountain side,
! can yet refuse on grounds of economy (?) the
j perfectly safe loan of Government credit to the
1 comparatively small extent necessary to de-
| velop that wealth and gather up and appropri-
; ate to the public benefit those treasures?
I The public debt of a nation is great or small
j according to the proportion it bears to the
; public wealth. A debt that would have crushed
! the United States in 1800 would not be felt to-
| day. Hence, in the exact proportion that our
i wealth increases our debt diminishes. For
instance, in 1840 the entire national wealth
was valued at $3,764,000,000. At the close
of the rebellion the national indebtedness
reached over thirty-three hundred millions. -
Hence, to have paid the debt of 1865 twenty-
eight years ago would have required ninety
per cent, of all the property, real, personal,
and mixed, in the country. In September,
1868, ourdebtwas $2,585,614,818; and accord-
ing to the most reliable estimates the wealth
of the nation had reached $30,000,000,000.
While, therefore, the debt of 1865 would h V£
consumed almost the entire property, public
and private, owned by the nation in 1840, the
payment of the debt of 1868 would require only
about eight per cent, of its present wealth. It
is therefore apparent that the burden of the
debt of 1868 is only about one-twelfth as great,
on our present property as the debt of 1865
would have been on the property of 1840.
Prospecting the future by a just analogy with
the past, let us see what will be the relative
burden of our debt in the year 1900, on the
assumption that the actual amount of the debt
remains unchanged, and that the ratio of in-
crease in wealth shall continue as great here-
after as it was from 1850 to I860. The ratio
of increase during that decade was one hun-
dred and twenty-six and forty-five hundredths
per cent. I will assume, however, that the
decennial increase will be only one hundred
per cent., and the following table will express
the result:
Percentage
National wealth. of debt to
property•
1860  $16,159,000,000
1870   32,318,000,000 7.84
1880   64,630,000,000 3.92
1800  129,272,000,000 1.96
1900   253,514.000,000 .98
For the data of this table I am indebted to
Hon. D. A. Wells, who shows by a document
published in 1864 that it is by no means an
unreasonable estimate of our prospective
wealth.
I think no one can reasonably doubt that our
national capacity for growth in the future is
quite equal to what it has been, and that with
wise statesmanship we-may confidently expect
to realize the increase just estimated. It will,
therefore, be seen that in 1900 our debt willbe
only one eighth as great a burden as it is now,
or only about one ninetieth what it would have
been on the property of 1840. In 1900 a tax
of only one per cent, will wipe out the entire
indebtedness, while now it requires one per
cent, to pay the current annual expenses of the
Government. Is it not, therefore, clear that
the burden of debt diminishes in exactly the
same ratio as the wealth of the nation increases ?
Let us now inquire more particularly how
we shall best promote this increase of wealth,
and thereby strengthen the public credit and
reduce the public burdens. What has been
the chief cause of this wonderful increase
heretofore? Let facts and figures answer. A
reference to the table of property already sub
mitted will show that the decennial increase of
wealth from 1800 to 1840 averaged only about
thirty-six and seven tenths per cent., while for
the next decade it suddenly ran up to eighty-
nine and six tenths per cent., and for the last
one, from 1850 to 1860, it sprang forward to
one hundred and twenty-six and forty five hun-
dredths per cent. The secret of this great
increase in the ratio may be found in the fact
that the last two decades were the periods of
railroad construction.
The relative growth in wealth with the in-
crease in railroads is shown in the following
statement:
