APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
n
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Protective and Free-Trade Tariffs Contrasted—Mr. Walion.
Ho. of Reps.
his report. After adverting to the deficiency in !
tlie revenue, the Secretary uses this emphatic i;
language: i|
'• A k'vi-hor of the tariff of 18,">7. and the imposition of j,
additional dunes, is the oi.hj icncd /, Uiilo^ ('on^re-s rball !'
take xorne «u'i ion to lehevc the Trea>uiv tu>iu a poition of (i
the expendnuie it now twinned to meet."
The President is even more emphatic. Re-
counting the loan and Treasury notes, to the
amount of #40,000,000, required of Congress at
the last session, he says:
"No btate.-anau would advise that we should go on in-
crea<in<  the national debt to meet the ouhnary expenses of
the Government. This :■ ould be a most ruinous ■policy. In
case oi was. our credit miht be our chief resource, at lenM

having eontiueied a i.ir^e debt in time of peace, (t i- our i
ttuo poh''V to luoiea^c oar revenue <-o to '-qtini out ex- 1
penditmes. It uouhl Ic ruinous to continue to hoiro<n." \
Thus, sir, the responsibility is thrown upon
Congress by the Executive; and I confess the i|
right of the Government and the people to hold
us strictly to if. :|
Let us consider the necessities of our condition ;1
in respect to revenue. j

tlie bal-
 $27,100,1^ 93 ;
as the deficiency m the resources of the Treasury i
for the single year ending 30th of June, 18.>8.
And if to the $11,311,798 17 deficiency m the bal-
ance, is added the sum of $23,716,300 received on
Treasury notes, the deficiency in the ordinary
curient receipts was $35,028,098 17. Now, sir,
I think the President was right; we cannot go on
at this rate, adding to the national debt twenty-
seven or thirty-five million per annum. Tins j
would, indeed, he " a most ruinous policy."" j
But this is not all. While frankly admitting i
that the '' present estimates arc based upon the |
opinion that a reaction m the trade and business j
of the country has commenced, and that we are j
gradually, but steadily, returning to aptosperous :
and healthy condition," the Seeretmy still admits
a deficiency for 1859 of $4,000,000, with an addi-
tion to the debt of ^>20,000.000, (for the loan author-
ized m 1858,) making a deficit of ^,24,000,000 for
that year; and for I860, he counts upon a deficit
of neaily eight million dollars more. Here, then,
accotdmg to the official estimates, are $32,000,000
to be added in the next year and a half to the ex-
isting debt; making, as the result of three years of
financiering by the present Administration, a debt
of ^59,000,000 ! And not all yet, sir. So much
for tlie official estimates; but if these approach no
nearer the truth than did the estimates of Decem-
ber, 1857, you must add $15,000,000 each to the
deficits of 1859 and 18G0, reckon the addition to
the debt by this Administration at £89,000,000,
and the total national debt in I860 at more than
one hundred millions. Nor is even this the worst
view of the case. Why, sir, tlie Secretary has
not estimated for a single dolinrof the <30,000,000
for that remarkable "■negotiation," which the
distinguished Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Doug-
las,] and the distinguished member oi thus lipase
from South Carolina, [Air. Kejtt.] have united
in recommending to us; that negotiation for the
Island of Cuba, with the Army and the Navy
bravelv ahead, and the negotiator safely behind.
And !$,30,000,000, in my judgment, are modest
nest-eiigs for the brood that will be apt to follow;
robbery to begin with, war m the middle, and a
national debt of two or three hundred million dol-
lars to bring up the rear—counting negroes and
nullification as the causes rather than the cost of
this magnificent crime.
But, to confine myself to the programme which
the President has provided for us m Ins mrssage,
let me say, that the #30,000,000 for the Cuba ne-
gotiation "are not in the estimates; the Pacific rail-
road is not in the estimates; the armed occupation I
of Mexican States, and all creation besides, m
the discretion of the Executive, is not in the esti-
mates; and war is not in the estimates; although,
if we are to credit the President, our differences
with Great Britain, Spain, Mexico, Paraguay,
and the Central American States, are ample
enough to lead to the most serious results. Now,
sir, without exaggeration, I think it may be said,
if wc arc to go into these great projects which
are gravely recommended by the President, and
as gravely discussed mtheSenatp and the House
—or, if we are to have even one little war upon
our hands—that the addition to our debt in the
three years ending on the 30lh of June, 1S60,
(even if the present official estimates are not ex-
ceeded,) will be at least eighty million instead
of fifcy-six; and the total national debt at that
date will be, m round numbers, $110,000,000. Sii,
I think it high time for us to take care of the rev-
enue of the country. In any view of the ques-
tion, without the addition of a dollar of debt be-
yond that already estimated, there is to be an
alarming deficiency in the next two years; and
do what we will, the Government will be bound
to cairy, for several succeeding years, a heavy
national debt.
And now, Mr. Chairman, let us consider the
necessity of a revision of the tariff in respect to
the business of the country; and, that the pic-
ture may not be exaggerated, I will quote the
language of the President:
When Congress met in December last, the busmen of
the cuiiiitiy had jiM been crushed by one of those periodical
levul-ions winch are the ineutable consequence ot oin un-
bound mid e.\trava;.Mnt system of bank eiedit and inflated
eiinenev. Wnh all the elements of national wealth in
abundance, our nianuiaetuie-. weie suspended, our u-eful
public ami p> ivate enU'tpuse* were arretted, and thousands
or laborer- weie depnvd ot employment, and reduced to
want. jnev-nled aiming tnc commercial,
munufucitaiiis;, eiul mcchamcci eludes."''—President's mes-
s« i?3 J)crei.tb<'r, 1857.
Su , I will attempt to add nothing, either to the
sad truth of history, or the intensity of the Pres-
ident's expression of it. Such was the picture of
December 1857; and what was it in 1858? The
President has not dared to look at it, or he has
not dared to draw it. lie is no longer historian,
but prophet; he gives us but few facts, and a full
measure of fancy. lie tells us what energy and
enterpnse will do, ''within the period of an-
other year;" that " capital has again accumulated
in the large cltles,,, although he foigets to tell us
that it has been drawn from the sulfeimg coun-
try; and he finishes the prophesy by assuring us
that " so soon an it is discovered that this capital can
be profitably employed," " prospti ity will again smile
throughout the land." No doubt of that, sir; and
no doubt, too, that suffering millions in this land
would have been greatly pleased, if he had but
named the day. But it is for k,s to say when
" tins capital can be profitably employed."
Mr. Chairman, I am not dealing with the fu-
ture, but with the condition of the business of the
country during the year 1858, and now. There
is an impression, indeed it is claimed, that the
condition of 385S was better than that of 1857. I
think 11 is a great mistake. It is indeed true, that
in 1857, the merchants and manufacturer^ m the
Atlantic Slates sank beueath the stroke. The sud-
den crash of many and large f stublishments, seen
and felt by all around, and flashed by telegraph
to all abroad, was a calamity wh;ch everybody
readily understood. The calami ly of 1858, though
lusss sinking, wos wider spread, and far larger in
, its los^f s. It spread from the narrow cities to the
1 broad country—from three million people to more
tiirin twenty—from the mei chants and manufac-
turers to the farmers. It spread silently, indeed,
but as fatally as " the pestilence that valketh in
dtukness;" and none can understand the magni-
tude of the ruin, until he shall gather a million
bills of moitality into one ?rand and sad sum total.
I will take for illustration two of the largest
branches of agriculture—cotton and flour.

! While the mciease of the price of cotton from
June 30, 1856, to June 30, 1857, was three and six
hundred ths cents per pound, the loss from June 30,
1857, to January 11, 1859, was one and five hun-
dredths cents per pound—equal to $i 1,750,000 on
the quantity exported in 1858; and while the loss
on flour was 24 per barrel from June 30,1856,
to June 30, 1857, the loss from the last named
date to January 18, 1859, was $2 23 per barrel—
being nearly thirty-six per cent, on the value of
1857, and amounting to $18,250,000 on the quan-
tity exported in 1858.
Thus it will be seen that, to the farmers—the
great body of the people of the country—the losses
of 3858 and to this date greatly exceed those of
the preceding year. But it is the loss of both
years, and of the year upon which we have al-
ready entered, and the loss to all interests, that
demands our care. Compared with 1856, when
cotton was low,and excluding 1857, when cotton
was high, the loss in exports of domestic products
in 1858 amounted to $15,000,000, or five and a half
per cent, of the exports of 1856. If that was the
loss on our annual product of at least three thou-
sand million dollars,* then our loss in the year
1858 was $170,000,000 on the value of all prod-
ucts, and §107,360,000 on agricultural products
alone, saying nothing of the reduction on all fixed
property, the losses by forced sales, the deprecia-
tion of capital, and the absolute losses by bank-
ruptcy. We may safely double that sum;f and
yet it is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared
with the blasted hopes, the mental and physical
misery, and the moral degradation which accom-
panied this terrible pecuniary loss. Figures can-
not measure the calamity; language cannot ex-
press it.
Mr. Chairman, it is clear enough, I think, even
from this incomplete statement of the present con-
dition of the country, both as to its revenue and
its business, that our first duty is to give all the
lelicf within our power. The disease is too se-
rious for,delay.
The next point I make is, that our present con-
dition is not exceptional or accidental; but that,
springing from identically the same causes, we
have had a recurrence of such calamities periodi-
cally in the past, and must, unless we provide a
remedy, expect them in the future. The Presi-
dent describes these calamities as " periodica!
convulsions,'' and plainly tells us that " the pe-
riodical revulsions which have existed in our past
history, must continue to return at intervals," so
long as their causes exist. I disagree with the
President, somewhat, in respect to the causes,
but I agree fully as to the consequent calamities.
The calamities have been as regular and as inev-
itable as the tides of the ocean, and have swept
the business of the country to wreck and rum,
as surely as the resistless wave sweeps all its bur-
den to the strand. There have been thiee marked
eras of rum within the memoiy of many living
men, occui ring at almost exact and equal points
of time, from essentially the same causes, and
marked by the same terrible disasters to the rev-
enue of the Government and the business of the
country. In these, sir, I propose to find the causes
of the present condition of the country ; and from
these causes, illustrated by the intervening periods
of prosperity and peace, I shall attempt to find
the measures of remedy and relief which 1 think
| we are bound to adopt.
| These eras embiaeed the periods of 1818-19,
' 18.37-38, and 3857-58, almost exact, of twenty
'' years. Few members of this House will remem-
I1 ber the convulsion of 1818-19: let me therefore
| say, m the language of President Monroe, quot-
i inic from the message of December 7, 1819, that
