Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

Have not seen or heard from General Trapier. Full investigation satisfies me that troops, guns, &amp;c., should be removed promptly from Saint Vincent's Island to Apalachicola. Shall I order the movement? A messenger here waiting for the order.

JOHN MILTON,

Governor of Florida.

RICHMOND, October 31, 1861.

Gov. JOHN MILTON,

You are authorized to remove the guns and other munitions of was from Saint Vincent's Island to Apalachicola. General Trapier will be in Fernandina in two or three days.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Tallahassee, Fla., October 31, 1861.

His Excellency JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Governor of Georgia:

SIR: I have this day recommended to the President and Secretary of War the establishment of a military department, to be composed of the following counties in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, lying on or near the Chattahoochee River, viz:

In Georgia: Decatur, Thomas, Miller, Early, Baker, Clay, Calhoun, Randolph, Quitman, Stewart, and Muscogee. In Alabama: Henry, Dale, Barbour, and Russell. In Florida: Leon, Gadsden, Wakulla, Jefferson, Madison, Liberty, Washington, Jackson, Calhoun, and Franklin.

I respectfully invite your consideration and approval of the measure proposed. Georgia and Alabama derive even more commercial advantages from Apalachicola than Florida herself, and both those States are deeply interested in its defense.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

JOHN MILTON.
