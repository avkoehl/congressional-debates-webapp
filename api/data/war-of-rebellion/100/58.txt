It will probably start day after to-morrow for Florence, and will then move on Sumterville, returning by way of the shortest rute to transports on Santee River. I most hearily approve and shall cordially carry out in good faith the views of General Sherman and the orders of the lieuenant-general in regard to the reduction to the minimum of the garrisons on this coast.
