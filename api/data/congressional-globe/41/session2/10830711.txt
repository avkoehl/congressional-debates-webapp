sider a joint resolution in regard to therancho

Mr. DAWES. I rise to make a privileged
report.
The SPEAKER. That would not super-
sede a motion to suspend the rules.
Mr. DAWES. 1 ask the gentleman to yield
to me for a few moments.
Mr. BINGHAM. I desire to say that since

ordered to be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. MAYNARD. I desire to say that I
reserve the right to make all points of order
when the House is in Committee of the Whole
on the bill.
Mr. DAWES. The bill appropriates the

The original estimates for these purposes
were $21,806,751 83. The Committeeon Ap-
propriations after patient labor for some weeks
and diligent inquiry, and such assistance as
they have been able to obtain from the Depart-
ments, have been enabled to cut down these
estimates, as follows:
Senate and House, and miscellaneous, $1,021,272 00

2,692,413 83
Amount recommended   19,203,037 00
821,895,510 83
With reference to this reduction I desire to
say that as it is very possible that it may have
been made in some instances at points where
it is not wise to make them, the committee
invite the scrutiny of the House to each of
these items; and so far as the reduction com-
mends itself to the spirit of economy and re-
trenchment which they believe pervades this
House they invoke its support in the passage
of the bill.
Mr. ARNELL. I desire to make au inquiry
of the chairman of the Committee ou Appro-
priations. Have any appropriations been made
by the committee for the Department of Educa-
tion ? ' . ■
Mr. DAWES. There was appropriated last
year $6,000. The committee this year,ha,v<>
made no appropriation for that Department.
I desire, Mr. Speaker, in view of the reser-
vation made by the gentleman from Tennes-
see, [Mr, Majnard,] to move so to suspend
the rules of the House that this bill shall b,e in
order when it comes up for consideration. I
do this because if we propose to cut off abuses
which have grown up in years that are past, in
the administration of affairs and in the expend-
iture of money it is necessary that propositions
which are contained in this bill should be
brought before the House for their consider-
ation ; but the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr.
Maykard] by raising his point of order pre-
vents the Committee on Appropriations from
bringing before the House for consideration cer-
tain provisions in this bill. I therefore move
to so suspend the rules of the House -that this
bill shall be in order in Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union.
Mr. BEN.TAMIN. I ask for the reading of
that portion of the bill which is legislative in
its character.
Mr. DAWES. The portions of it which are
legislative in character are scattered through
the bill.
Mr. ARNELL. Then I demand the read-
ing of the whole bill.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I de-
sire to ask the chairman of the Committee
on Appropriations how mucli of the two mil-
lions and odd hundred thousand dollars saved
by the bill is saved from legislative expenses ?
Mr. DAWES. I have not added up the
figures myself, but the clerk of the commit-
tee has, and I believe he is correct, and the
amount is $1,021,272.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Nearly
one half 1
Mr. DAWES. Yes, sir; if I find any error
I will communicate it to my colleague.
Mr. ALLISON. I desire to ask the chair-
man of the Committee on Appropriations how
the appropriations proposed by the commit-
tee compare with similar appropriations made
last year by Congress, and whether there is a
reduction of appropriations or an increase?
Mr. DAWES. As a, general remark I reply
to the gentleman that there is a reduction, but
that the reduction from last year is small. In
the general result, however, the amount is
carried up above the appropriations of last
year by the item for the public .printing, in
which there is a vast increase caused by the
unusual amount of matter thrown upon the
printing office by the Departments at the other
end of the avenue. There is an astonishing
increase of work in the Public Printing Office
caused in that manner, and calling, in the
opinion of the Committee on Appropriations,
very loudly for legislation; but there is no
legislation in reference to that point in this bill.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I would
inquire if that amount of printing which is
thrown upon the Public Printing Office from
the other end of the avenue is not caused by
the factthat, by the law of lastyearwe required
all the departmental printing offices to stop?
There used to be departmental printing offices,
and I remember reporting aprovision stopping
all those offices.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. 1 rise to a point of
order. This debate is out of order on a motion
to suspend the rules, and also because of the
rule that appropriation bills shall receive their
first consideration in Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER. The Chair sustains the
point of order. Discussion is out of order.
Mr. COX. I desire to ask the gentleman
from Massiichusetts a question.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Illi-
nois [Mr. Farkswobth] raises the point of
