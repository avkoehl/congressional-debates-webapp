bridge, via the Hampshire road. 7 p. m., the rain that commenced this morning still continues. It is almost impossible for trains to move down the bank of the river to the pontoon bridge,a nd up the bank on the other side. The road on the other side for three miles is almost impassable. But very few wagons and only two or three caissons have crossed up to this hour. Owing to the miserable condition of the road it will be impossible for all of the trains and artillery on this side of the river to cross before noon to-morrow. 8 p. m., sent word to division commanders that it will be impossible to cross the river to-night, and that the movement of the infantry will be suspended until further orders. The artillery which has been taken out of our lines of works this evening has also been ordered back. 9 p. m., reports from the cavalry forces guarding the fords of Duck River above and below Columbia have been received by General Schofield this evening, to the effect that no movements of the enemy have been discovered; that he has appeared at none of the fords. 12 midnight, two of the boats of the pontoon bridge have sunk, and but one or two wagons have been able to get over since 7 p. m. Orders were sent at this hour by General Schofield not to attempt to cross over any more to-night, but to fix the bridge and cross them over to-morrow a. m. The rain that commenced this morning still continues. If General A. J. Smith's force has reached Nashville it may be sent to Columbia to-morrow; if it is so sent we will not cross to the north bank of the river, but, with these re-enforcements, will be able to hold our advanced lines on the south side of the river, while a force of infantry can be left on the north side to prevent Hood from crossing.

November 27.- 8 a. m., sent word to division commanders that they would not move to-day., but must be prepared to receive orders to cross the river to-night. Pioneers are working on the road at the river crossing at the pontoon bridge and on the other side of the river, and the trains will be worked over if possible this morning. The rain has now ceased. 1 p. m., in accordance with instructions received from Major-General Schofield, directed division commanders to send all wagons to the north bank of the river at once. 3 p. m., received Special Field Orders, of which the following is a copy.* 3 p. m., sent orders to division commanders to move to-night across the river in the order-First, General Wood; second, General Kimball; third, General Wagner; and for General Wood to start at 6 p. m.; the pickets to be withdrawn to the outer line of works at 6.30 p. m., and to the inner line at 7.30 p. m., and from this latter line toward morning. General J. A. Smith has not yet been heard from. It is not yet known whether he has reached Nashville. The forces of this corps withdrew, in accordance with instructions, at the hours indicated, without being followed by the enemy. The last of the corps crossed the river at midnight. The rain has ceased; it has not rained since daylight. It is now decided by General Schofield to destroy the pontoon and railroad bridges across be impossible to protect them and the fords both above and below Columbia. Deserters from the enemy, just in, report that the last of Hood's infantry arrived at Columbia this evening; that Hood now has 40,000 infantry strong and from 10,000 to 12,000 cavalry. Our force at present: Fourth Corps, about 15,000, and Schofield's (Army of the Ohio), about 10,000, with about 3,500 cavalry. Our forces are increasing rapidly each day by the addition of recruits arriving from the North, from 300 to 350 per day.
