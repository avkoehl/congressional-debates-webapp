Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received. General Halleck says, in a dispatch of to- day, General Grant thinks I can and ought to send you re- enforcements. I have looked upon General A. J. Smith's command as a loan from you. They are now near Kansas border, and will march toward Saint Louis with all practicable speed, scouring the country. They will be provided with everything needful, and sent to you as soon as they can reach the Mississippi. I have no cavalry available. I would like very much to know your exact wants and situation.

I forgot to say that Winslow's cavalry, that came with General Mower, will be sent to Memphis as soon as it can be done. It is now on the Kansas border, has had a hard campaign, and must be re- mounted, which will be done as speedily as possible.
