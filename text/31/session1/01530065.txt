New Series No. 5.
that proposition to be out of order, and, therefore,
that it had not been received.
Mr. HOLMES declared that no such vote had
ever been taken.
[Calls to order, and cries of " Call the roll.'1]
Mr. HOLMES. The vote of which the Clerk
speaks was on ordering the yeas and nays. If
gentlemen choose to vioiafe the rights of a member,
he (Mr. H.) would stand up for that member, even
though it was Mr. Giddings.
[Calls to order, and some laughter.]
The Clerk stated the question of order.
Mr. V1N l'ON submitted that there could be no
question of order whilst the roll was bein^ called
[Cries : ts Call the roll.1'] * ° |
Mr. BURT rose to say, that, after one gentle- I
man had answered to his name, on the call of the j
roll, the Clerk had no righL to recognize any i
member. j
Mr. HOLMES said there wa3 no such rule in !
existence now as that laid down by the gentleman j
from Ohio. [Air. "Vinton.] •
Mr. VINTON. The point has been decided by j
the House a hundred times. j
Some animated conversation passed between I
Messrs. Vinton and Holmes, of which nothing .
is known to the reporter beyond the gesticulations |
which accompanied it.
Mr. HOLMES insisted on the question. There :
was uo parliamentary rule (and under that law ,
they were now acting) by which his question was
out of order. ;
[A. voice: There is a rule of the House.] i
Mr. HOLMES, Of the House, yes; but no 1
rules have been adopted for the government of this
House. j
The Clerk proceeded with the call of the roll. '
Mr. HOLMES insisted on the question. ■
[Calls to order, and " Go on with the roll."] [
Mr. HOLMES. I will not give up a principle,
evenlthough Mr. Giddixgs himself does.
[Roars of laughter and calls to order.]
The Clerk proceeded with the call of the roll.
Mr. HOLMES, (turning to Mr. Giddings.) Do 1
you give it up, Mr. Giddings ? [Laughter.]
Mr. GIDDINGS, (in his seat ) No, but the
Clerk has entered it upon the Journal as being ■
rejected.
Here the conversation ended. 1
The Clerk proceeded with thecal! of the foil,

nounced—yeas 113, nays 106, as follows: ;

ELECTION OF SPEAKER.
There was now a general demand over
House thai the roll be called.
Mr. ASPLVHTN rose, he said, to a privileged
question.
Mr. WOOD moved that the House do now ad-
journ.
The Clerk stated the motion—
A.nd the question thereon having; been taken, it
was decided in the negative, without a division.
So the House refused to adjourn.
[Cries of " Call the roll.]
Mr. ASHMUN moved to reconsider the vote by
which the proposition of Mr. Stanton had been
adopted.
(Several members: " We have no rules"—
fi There is no necessity for the motion."
Mr. ASHMUN withdrew his motion.
[Cries of " The roii"—" Call the roll."]
Mr. STANLY rose and said; Mr. Clerk, with
the permission of the House, I wish to make a
statement relating to myself. After the adoption
of this resolution—which I earnestly hope will
lead to an organization—I presume, of course, it
is desirable that the members of each party should
vote for their respective favorites. The other side !
have their favorite, and we have ours; and all who
wish an organization will vote for some gentleman
of whose election we can have a reasonable hope.
I most respectfully but earnestly express the wish
that no gentleman will vote for me, but that they
will all, for the sake of the country, give their
votes for him who is decidedly the favorite of the
Wh)£ party, as i shall.
Mr. MoCLERNA-ND rose, he said, to make n
personal announcement. During the protracted
and painful struggle which had ensued in regard
to the Speakership, his name had been introduced,
and the poll for several days past showed an in-
creasing vote in his favor. He had neither ex-
pected nor in any way solicited this flattering dis-
tinction. To its kind authors he begged to return
his grateful acknowledgments, which, although an
humble tribute, he hoped they would receive. He
had not wished at any time to be placed as an as-
pirant for the Speakership; on the contrary, he
would avoid rather than court its weighty respon-
sibilities. With mis feeling, therefore, he would
beseech his friends—those who had voted for him,
and those who might be disposed to do so—to ,
withhold their suffrages from him, that they might J
be bestowed upon some other member more worthy
to receive them, and more likely to be elected.
Mr. McC. repeated this request.
THE SPEAKERSHIP.
The House again proceeded to vote viva voce for
the election of Speaker.
Messrs. Venable of North Carolina, Henry of
Vermont, and Van Dyke of New Jersey, resumed
their seats at the Clerk's table as tellers to count
the vote.
The roll was then called for the sixtieth time,
when the tellers reported that the whole number
of votes given was 217; necessary to a choice 109;

! [When the name of Mr. Cartter, of Ohio, was
