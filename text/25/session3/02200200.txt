February 22,
United Stiies, and whereas, such trade involves an out
riL,eou= vi dition ft homin lights, is i disgrace to the coim

Tht uJoie, tu the end that all oh tielcsto thecorioidcration
ot this- subject eny be removed and a remedy tor the evil
speedily provnl d,
" Resollad I hat *o much of the fifth of the resolutions
on tin subject ol si ivtry, pi M d !>y this Hon t on tlie 11th

of slaves fiom St itc to State,' md prohibits the iction of
this House on l cverv p( tition, memoinl, rt solution, piop
osmon, or paper touching the same, be, and hereby is
rescinded "
After which, it is icported tint 'Mr Duv^on c died foj
the reading of the re solution , which hivmg b* en ignn
read, Air ístí.*íly snd he wished to introduce to inn ml
ment The Chur snd it wii not now in irder the resolu
tion not yet being in the po st. ssiou ot the House. "
Whtn Mr qum s resolution wis u ul,md I henrd tin
words iC outngeous viol mon of humm rights 'and ' dis
graceful   applied is I thought, to the sHvdioldmg tatúes,
and to North Carolina as one ot thorn, I could not rt press
the indignation Í hit it such 1 mguige It vvi-i unde r the
influence of this excíteme nt th it I v\ i hed to " introduce
an amendment," when the iE Chair «iid it wis not now in
order "
The amendment I wished to introduce was in the words
following
"Jlesoíue<Ü,That said resolution is disr< spectful m its lui
gmge, and outrageously insulting to the n piesentim s oí
the slavthotdmgbtite s , tint it iscilt ulited to provoke ind
irritate the members Jrom siul fotuta and th it tin consul
eration of said resolution would be m e outtageous viol ition'
ot the respect due to the sliveholdmg elates and would

member who prest nts it is u tunees i total disitgird ot
the icelfiiiis oí tin representatives oí the si iveholelmg tallies
