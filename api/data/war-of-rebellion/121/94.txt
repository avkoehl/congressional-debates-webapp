JANUARY 20, 1865.

Respectfully returned to Honorable Secretary of War.

The complaint is well founded. These men sometimes pass the night without fire. The quartermaster of prisons is forbidden to get fuel except through the regular channels. I have forwarded repeated complaints without remedy. I do not doubt that there has been considerable loss of life already at the Libby and Castle Thunder from this cause. The fault is with those officers whose duty it was to furnish a supply of fuel, and who have not made proper provisions.

IS. H. CARRINGTON,

Provost-Marshal.

Respectfully referred to Captain Weisiger for attention.

There is now plenty of wood at the yard with which to supply all reasonable demands.

ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

Richmond, January 26, 1865.

Respectfully returned to Major Maynard.

You are aware of the difficulty in procuring wood for the last ten days. I borrowed wood several days to fill requisitions made upon this office and was not aware that any suffering had existed at the prisons. My receipts for the last two days have increased, and trust there will not be any further cause for complaint.

Very respectfully,

WM. W. WEISIGER,

Assistant Quartermaster.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.
