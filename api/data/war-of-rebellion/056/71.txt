HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 6, 1863.

Brig. Gen. J. D. STEVENSON,Corinth, Miss.:

It is impossible for me to send you any troops from here. Hatch has returned, having driven Chalmers across Tallahatchie. Mizner is coming into La Grange, and will be ordered to you with all force at La Grange. Send scout across to Dodge, at Eastport. Corinth must be held to your best ability and the last extremity. Let me know if the road is damaged and how much, and in what way the troops at La Grange can best come to you.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 6, 1863.

Brig. Gen. J. D. STEVENSON, Corinth, Miss.:

If you are cut off, as you probably will be, open communications with the river at Hamburg through gun-boats and report that way. If the worst comes, destroy all stores, ammunition, and arms, and fall back to the gun-boats. I will move to you as soon as troops come. Hold out to the last. I do not think they will move infantry and artillery on you, as they cannot feed them long. I will only hold to Moscow and with cavalry to La Grange.

Send all engines and cars except what you want to Memphis, with the extra stores and sick at Corinth and La Grange, as soon as the road is open. Close your lines and impress every able-bodied man into the military service and put him on duty.
