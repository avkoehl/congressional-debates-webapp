OFFICE INDIAN AFFAIRS, NORTHERN DIST. CALIFORNIA,

San Francisco, July 2, 1862.

Brigadier General GEORGE WRIGHT:

SIR: I am just in receipt of information from the Smith River Valley that the troops sent thither have crossed the river and are about settling camp almost in the midst of the Indians, or at least about half way between the two largest tribes, or say half mile from one tribe and a mile from the others. I hope you will order the troops on the south side of the river to be stationed at or near a place called Fort Dick, where U. S. land and good water can be found in abundance.

I have the honor to be, &amp;c.,
