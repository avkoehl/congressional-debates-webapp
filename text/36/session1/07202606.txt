THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 4,
public buildings, I think I can say a majority
â– would have favored this bill, which seems to be
an exception to the general rule. Brooklyn is the
third city in population in the Union. Its post
office is inconvenient and unsafe, having been once
or twic,e robbed. This bill, drafted by .their Rep-
resentative, [Mr. Humphrey,] who has been sev-
eral times before the committee urgently pressing
it, is closely guarded. It allows $40,000 for the
site, and $100,000 for the building, and no con-
tract is to be made until bids are received for the
entire completion of the building within that
amount, so that no additional appropriation can
be asked hereafter, which has always been one of
the great objections to bills of this character. It
may be too late in the session to ask action on the
bill at this time, and I move its reference to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
LANDS FOR RAILROADS.
Mr. VANDEVER, from the Committee on
Public Lands, reported a bill to amend an act en-
titled " An act granting lands in alternate sections
to the State of Mississippi, to aid in the construc-
'tion of railroads", and for other purposes," ap-
proved August 11, 1856; which was read a first
and second time.
Mr. SINGLETON. I ask the House to put
that bill upon its passage. It involves only the
place of terminus of a railroad, and I hope there
will be no objection.
Mr. HICKMAN. I object; but I do not ob-
ject on account of the mentis of the bill, but be-
cause it consumes our time this morning.
Mr. SINGLETON. I would say to the gen-
tleman that the action of the company for the
construction of that railroad depends upon this
change.
Mr. HICKMAN. I withdraw my objection.
The hill was then ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was ac-
cordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. SINGLETON moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and also moved
to lay the motion to reconsider upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

order, if the gentleman yields the floor.
