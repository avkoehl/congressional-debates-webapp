WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., September 7, 1864.

Governor M. L. BONHAM,

Columbia, S. C.:

Movement by Sherman toward your State not anticipated. Should it occur, General Hood's army, still intact, will operate to prevent and defend. General Jones' needs do not allow withdrawal of reserves from Charleston. Instead, as many prisoners have to be temporarily sent to that city, more of the reserves are needed as indispensable guards.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 8, 1864--2.30 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I suggest that all the reserves of Georgia, under General Cobb, be ordered to this army and the prisoners removed; that Lieutenant-General Taylor be ordered to relieve General Hardee, bringing with him all the troops he can.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 8, 1864--2.30 p. m.

Major General F. GARDNER,

Mobile, Ala.:

I send the following dispatch to Lieutenant-General Taylor; if not there please answer. "Have any your troops crossed the river as yet? If not, when will they be over?"

[J. B. HOOD,

General.]
