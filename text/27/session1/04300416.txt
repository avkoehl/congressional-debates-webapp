York    The farmer or planter dews to transport
the produce ot his farm <u rUntat.on  to i.arket
for sale—that !*, be desires io exchange property at
home for its equiva'cnt valae m tin market ¡own
It would seem tnat, in eq<A n\ of justice, they lud
the same claim upon the Government for afi-
ance—that is,  no r ghtful c¡a m at all.    Congress
has   no   light,   a1 !   is   under  no obi'gatiop, to
furnish   the means of trans'er to eitbei—tu pro
vide   for   either   the   laclitics   of   exchanging
value   m   oí e   p'ace   lor   value   in   another.
And   if   Congress   was   bound    to supply the
means   of exchange,   or  to  make  the revenue
subsihary to t^a purpose, there dues not appear to
be the slushiest nee ssiiy for the use of a Bank of
the United States.    It could le moie readily eff<e-
ed at once, by aathonri' g the prop r officer, of the
Treasury to biy and sell bids of exchange upon
different places, as the wants of the Government
and the st le * f the finances mdica ed.    In  'hts
mode the íevenue would be employed more conve-
niently to die Governm ntand to the citiz-n, would
be more immediately under the supervisión of the
Government, would  be managed for purpecs of
exchange by legal officers strictly accountable a"d
punishable.    Henee there caí be no necessity ol
creating a mammoth 'Jink,'o swallow    p cII the
revenues of the United Sate", firing a piomise
•which it never can ¡ulfil, of suppljmg ihe means,
and equalizing the exchanges- oí the country.
In fi ie, this mee'irg are of opinion, frota a care-
ful peru-al ot the Constuution, that Ihsere is not a
single power granted therein, which may not be
carried mlo execution without Ihe agency of a Na-
tional Corporation. They do not bebeve any such
lnstitu ion necessary 01 appropnate to the accom-
plishment oí any constitutional purpose— \at it is
