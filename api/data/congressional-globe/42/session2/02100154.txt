APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 16,
Ho. of Reps..
Tariff and its Burdens—Mr. Qrossland.
42d Cong.,..2d Sess.
Daring the last year of the last Democratic
Administration the entire expenses of the Gov-
ernment amounted to less than fifty-six mil-
lion dollars, as follows:
Civil and miscellaneous $27,976,434
War Department  16,409,767
Navy Department 11,514,964
Total $56,901,165
The Republican party denounced this as
unprecedented and wicked extravagance.
How much ought these expenses to be in-
creased on account of increase of population,
&c.? I quote from an estimate presented in
a speech of my distinguished friend from New
York, [Mr. Brooks,] made last spring in this
House, which was admitted by the leaders of
the Republican party, and by the distinguished
leader of the protectionists from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Kelley,] to be afair speech. Mr. Brooks
estimates thus, except that he allowed thirty
per cent, for increase of population. Total
expenses last year of—
Buchanan's administration $55,901,000
Add for increase population 22 per cent... 12.320,000
For pensions  28,OOU.OOO
For depreciation of currency  7,000,000
Interest on public debt :  115,000,000
Total  218,221,000
Add Indian expenses  3,000,000
Total $221,221,000
to which ought to be added the one per
cent, provided for the sinking fund, which will
amount to §11,500.000, which would raise the
amount to $232,721,000. Surely this amount
ought to be ample and sufficient to defray all
the expenses of the Government. Yet last
year the people paid as follows:
Collected from customs $2f>i.270.40S 05
Collected from internal revenue  143,098.loo 63
Collected from sales public lands  2,388,616 68
Collected from miscellaneous sources... 31,566,736 89
Amount of net receipts during last
fiscal year  383,323,944 89
The amount as estimated above  221.221,000 00
Excess of collections over what ought
to have been expended $162,102,944 S9
Over one hundred and fifty-two million more
than ought to be collected or expended. The
Committee of Ways and Means and every
Representative can see that we are expend-
ing large sums of the people's money without
necessity and without right.
But, sir, I cannot stop here. There are
other means of reducing and lightening the
burdens of the tax-payers. As i have said,
we have thousands of worthless and useless
officeholders, on high salaries, doing nothing
of value to the country, living luxuriously,
mere sinecurists, rendering no service. Will
any man on this floor who has been one
week at this capital dare ask for proof? If
he does, I will tell him to look around this
Hall and answer me how many pensioners on
the Treasury and on the labor and toil of the
people he can see Look at every door, look
at every opening in the wall, and he will see
them. Go below and above, inside and out-
side, and he will see them. Are one half of
them necessary? Are not expenses incieased
enormously by having them here? I will show
you: the expenses of the legislative depart-
ment during the last year that Democracy
managed and controlled affairs, and honesty
and economy presided here, were §2,000,000,
How much was appropriated for the same pur-
pose by the bill which passed a few days ago ?
Why, $3,421,812 40, showing an increased
expense of $1,421,812 40. Can you not see
"willful and wasteful profligacy in this increase
of expenses ? I invite the committee who are
deliberately devising u ways and means"
'to look ut these figures. I invite the com-
mittee to go to the various Departments and
see what vast multitudes there are in the pay
of the Government, what services they are
rendering^ how much labor they perform, and
then let them inform this House and the coun-
try if there are not thousands; yes, sir, I re-
peat, thousands more than are necessary for
the transaction of the business. I have taken
occasion to make some investigation, and have
been led by it to the conclusion that a wild,
reckless waste of money is perpetrated in the
employment of officers and clerks; and I will
state some facts derived from my investigations.
I append a table, showing the amount of money
expended last year in the several Departments
in the payment of salaries, namely :
Legislative  $4,202,015 74
Executive  50,180 00
Department of State  177,200 00
Treasury Department-  8,557,765 50
United States Mint, branches, and as-
say offices   790,380 00
Governments of the Territories  219,700 00
Department of the Interior  1,661,380 00
Department of Agriculture  168,440 00
Post Office Department  463,622 00
War Department  598,350 00
Navy Department    141,740 00
Judicial   356,200 00
Court of Claims  428,340 00
Department of Justice  198.820 00
Total $18.0] 4.733 24
Now I propose to show the number of offi-
cers in the Navy, and the amount of their
salaries per annum. We have—
1 Admiral $13,000
1 Vice Admiral  9,000
12 rear admirals, each  6,OK)
25 commodores, each  5,000
50 captaias, each  4,500
89 commanders, each  3,500
178 lieutenant commanders, each  3,000
141 lieutenants, each  2,600
151 master?, each  2,000
169 ensigns, each  1,400
69 midshipmen, each :  1,400
150 surgeons, each  2,0;i0
148 paymasters, each  1,900
257 engineers and assistant engineers, each,
from $1,900 to 4.200
24 chaplains, each, from  2,800 to 4,200
These vast hordes of officers are in the pay
of the Government, and draw these enormous
salaries, whether they are in the discharge
of any duty or not. And nearly all of them
have numerous clerks, who also receive high
salaries.
Now, sir, the people, who pay taxes to
defray the expenditures of the Government,
would like to know what duties these officers
render. What fleets and vessels have we in
commission to require so many commanders
and other officers? We have but one hun-
dred and one vessels of the first, second,
third, and fourth rate; but sixty-five of these
are in service, the remaining thirty-six being
laid up repairing and not doing service. We
have fifty one iron-clad vessels, but five of
which are in service, the other forty-six being
laid up and doing no service. And these con-
stitute all the vessels belonging to the Navy
of the United States, except a few worthless
tugs. Sixty-nine vessels and iron-clads in
service and fourteen hundred and thirty-nine
officers.
I get these facts from the Navy Register and
other strictly official sources and defy contra-
diction of what I state. I have not mentioned
the Marine corps as part of the naval estab-
lishment, and tor which this House appropri-
ated a few days ago 55678,145. Nor have I
included in this list of Navy officers the pro
lessors of mathematics employed, the naval
constructors, or civil engineers. And now,
sir, I ask, can any sane man believe that all
these officers are necessary, and does he believe
that one half of them are rendering any duty
whatever? No, sir; no, sir. Then, I ask fur-
ther, can any honest Representative approve
of this useless waste of mouey ?
In the Army there are doubtless many hun-
dreds of useless officers, and as flagrant abuses
are chargeable there as to the Navy, but I
have not time to pursue it.
I desire now to direct the attention of Rep-
resentatives to theTreasury Department. They
have employed there more than three thousand
five hundred officers, clerks, &c., as shown
by the response of the Secretary to a resolu-
tion of this House addressing certain in-
quiries to him some time ago. They receive
salaries of from $900 to §8,000. Now, sir,
I shall prove in few words that one half
of the clerks can be dispensed with. They
work, or rather remain in the Treasury build-
ing, but six hours per day ; they go in at
nine and are turned out at three o'clock each
day; they are not required to. work but teu
months in twelve, and have two months' holi-
day or rest out of each year, but all are paid
for the whole twelve months. As I before
stated, they work six hours per day for ten
months, and are paid large salaries lor a full
year's work. The tax-payers who toil for the
money that pays these salaries, their wives
and children, labor from sunrise to sunset
every day, the year round. No rest for tbem ;
they must toil incessantly for food and cloth-
ing and the payment of taxes.
I understand that the same rule prevails in
all the Departments, and about the same
trifling services rendered by the employes,
and similar salaries paid them. And yet the
Secretaries and heads of Departments are all
clamoring for an increase of salaries for their
assistants(?) and clerks; they are overworked
and poorly paid it is complained, and some
Representatives are affected by these appeals,
and are ready to put their hands deeper into
the pockets of the farmer, mechanic, and
other tax-payers, who, as I have said, toil
from daylight till dark under the burning
suns of summer and in the freezing winds
of winter, and rob them of an addi;ional per
cent, of their hard earnings, for what? Why,
to increase the salaries of these poor (?) clerks
who work but two thirds of a day at such
slavish service as counting postal currency
and signing names in comfortable rooms,
seated on easy chairs. I beg, you, gentle-
men to stop and reflect. You are selling your
constituents into perpetual slavery ; think of
their toils and trials; think of the hardships
and privations they have to endure, and re-
member if you increase salaries you neces-
sarily increase taxation ; and, instead of paying
higher salaries for such labor as the Govern-
ment receives, let us reform these abuses, dis-
charge the useless number, employ competent
men, who are willing to render an honest, full
day's labor for its value.
I come now, sir, to speak of the losses the
Government sustains by the dishonesty of
those employed to transactthe public business.
IIow many millions are annually lost by de-
falcations, by thefts and robberies? An official
statement shows that in the internal revenue
department alone over twenty million dol-
lars which was collected from tliepeople stands
unaccounted for by the collectors. And from
every direction, North, South, Bast, and West,
we have daily accounts of defalcations and
robberies; collectois of internal revenue, re-
ceivers of custom, quartermasters, from all
classes of those who get the public money into
their bands, come accounts of defalcations
and delinquencies, and millions upon millions
of dollars have been stolen.
Men without character, without capacity,
(except to steal,) and without responsibility,
have been appointed to the most important
offices. I n some instances men of notoriously
bad character, known to be infamous m the
estimation of every honest acquaintance, have
been given positions, and sent out to collect
