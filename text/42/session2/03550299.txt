Observe that skilled labor ranges from ten
to fifty per cent, higher in the States than
in the Dominion. Skilled labor shows less
difference. The disparity is great enough in
all branches to attract a steady stream of emi-
gration from the sparsely settled British colony,
with new and cheap lauds, even to our older
States.
Such figures are the proof that the American
financial policy does keep up wages; lhat

wages at a given time are in the ratio of the
duties on the articles which we manufacture.
To-day, leaving all else unchanged, strike off
all duties on woolen and iron, and their manu-
factures, and all wages would fall nearly in the
ratio of the duties to the market .price. The'
fall in wages would first be in those manufac-
tures, and then would extend to other indus-
tries. Observehow much cheaper skilled labor
is in Canada than in the United States. It will
not be hard to write a tariff that will place the
rewards of akiiled labor on the same basis on
both sides of the St. Lawrence. American
producers prefer their own condition, and do
not seek such a change.
The figures already given are a response also
to the aigument of the gentleman from Indi-
ana, [Mr. Kerr,] who tells us that " wages are
advancing more rapidly now in the greatlabor
countries of Europe than in the United States."
It is true that the production of the precious
metals has caused a general increase iu prices
since the discovery of gold in California, of
from fifteen to twenty five per cent.; and while
the effect was felt here years ago, it has only just
now affected wages in some of the European
countries. The steady immigration to America
combined with other causes, has drained the
foreign labor market of some of its best sup-
plies, and that influence is now recognized.
More than by the departure of numbers, itbas
aroused those who remained, and created a
moral power which daily asserts itself.
When intelligent workingmen testily, as did
a silk-worker before the Committee of Ways
and Means, that they can save more here than
their total earnings in England, improvement
mpst occur there, or all operatives who can
will come hither. That is the reason why
wages ii  Manchester have recently advanced
twenty-five per cent., in British iron-works
thirty-three per cent., and in Germany, in some
branches, at the same rate, I am indebted
to the Bureau of Statistics for a table of the
advance on the Clyde within six years. It
shows an advance of from twelve to thirty-
three per cent.:

Bokeau of Statistics, April 12,1872.
It has already been seen that a like advance
has taken place in corresponding branches in
this country. I rejoice that real improve-
ment has been achieved in Britain and on the
continent. This result is in a large part attrib-
utable to American example and American
ideas. Our policy has favored high wages,
which a distinguished gentleman in another
place [Senator Hamilton, of Maryland] and,
as I understand him, my colleague [Mr. Burch-
abd] deem of no advantage. It has wrought
beneficent effects here. We have refused to
strike down our people to the condition of

Europe. We have thus done something to
elevate the condition of the Old World. More
of this work remains to do. We must adhere
to the system by which we have prospered.
We must refuse to strike down the standard
of wages on the poor pretext that somewhere
a coat can be bought cheaper or a brogan for
a few sous less. The peddler's plea of a cheap
market must not drown the statesman's appeal
for steady work for all at fair wages. We
cannot surrender the results of the American
policy for all the theories from Quesnay to
Bastiat. Let Britain choose her own path
and walk in it, and may prosperity be her por-
tion. Our career is, as it has been, other, and
we believe better, and this continent must
continue the field of vigorous aud remunera-
tive production.
the batio op labor.
My colleague on the committee, the gentle-
man from Missouri, [Mr. Finkklnburg,] sur-
prised the committee on Friday last by these
words;
"There is nothing more delusive than this theory
of compensation for difference in cost of labor,
for the simple reason that the price of labor is by no
means a true test of the cost of production. Raw
material forms'the bulk of the cost of production,
and this is often cheapest where labor is dearest,'
and such is the case with many factories and indus-
tries in this country. Many j/ersoas take it "for
granted that the labor account is, the great item in
the manufacture of our protected goods; aiid we
often hear manufacturers argue in this way: I pay
my laborers twice as much as is paid to laborers in
the same line of business in Europe; therotoro I
should have twice the price for my. goods. 11ms
argument, plausible as it may seem at first glance, ig
utterly fallacious and a flimsy pretext for monopoly
duties.
"I have paid some attention of late to the propor-
tion of the cost of labor to'the whole cost of mafiu-
faetured products, and I have found) fomewhat to
iay own surprise, that it rarely exceeds twenty-five
per cent. For instance, labor represents only fif-
teen to twenty per cent.' in pi'g iron, only fifteen
per cent, in woolen #oods, twenty-five per cent, in
cotton goods, eighteen per cent, in paper, and in
some articles, as for instance in soap, it sinks down
to only six per cent., while a tobacco manufacturer
told us in committee that the labor in sweetened
plug tobacco costs less than the licorice that goes
into it."
The fallacy and inaccuracy of this statement,
arise from the assumption that the labor to b«
estimated is only that in the last form of tha
product. But labor vitalizes the whole fabric of
socie'y. Before you can make anything, labor
must prostrate your forests, redeem your soil,
fashion your homes, produce your food and
clothing. It must bi iug metal from your mines,
and render it available for tools. Tben it
must carry every product forward from seed
planting to harvest, to market, and to every
new form. Labor in plug tobacco includes ail
these elements, before it begins to be plug at
all.
Analyze ready-made clothing, for example.
Under the proposed bill it will have a duty of
fil'ty-four and one fourth per cent. To trans-
form the cloths into clothing the labo* may
be twenty percent, of the new value.. Bat if
clothing be imported, it represents not that
labor only. Yon must go back to the wool-
raiser, and te the articles constituting his sap-
port and comforts. You must reckon all the
labor in the factory and the machinery, in the
dye-stuffs and the incidentals. You must in-
clude every process of wool selection, of oard-
ing, spinning, weaving, and finishing. You
cannot omit thread and buttons, and the labor
preliminary to the production of either. AH
this is to be added to the twenty per cent, of
the tailor in transforming the articles into gar-
ments ready for wear.
Indeed, without this long analysis, you will
see that labor is often almost the exclusive
element in production. Bloom iron is made
by J. & J. Rogers, Essex county, New York,
and the following statement of the actual cost
of manufacture in 1870-71 is furnished from
them:
