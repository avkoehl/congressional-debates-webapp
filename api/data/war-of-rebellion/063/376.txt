the escort, and will march 400 yards in front of the train, with a few men still in advance and on the right and left of the road, to prevent surprise. A rear guard of the same strength will march in a similar manner in rear of the train. The remainder of the escort will march in the center of the train between the two divisions, ready to support either the front or rear guards, and will keep flankers out on each side 300 or 400 yards from the road.

The wagons of the train will not be allowed to separate on any pretense. When a part stop for forage, the others must wait till these are loaded, when the whole will move on together. A sufficient number of soldiers from the escort will be detailed to load the wagons rapidly.

If attacked, or if it is found necessary to remain out over night, the train will be parked, and every possible effort made to defend it. The teamsters will be shot on the spot if they do not obey orders or attempt to run away.
