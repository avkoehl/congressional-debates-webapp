absolute necessity and will be made to fall equally upon the troops of the different States of the department. The proportion of cavalry is greatly in excess over the other arms of service. Their horses are consuming the breadstuffs of the country. Already have we been forced back in search of forage to the inland streams of Texas. If continued mounted they would soon be driven from the country without an effort on the part of the enemy. All good and true men must recognize the necessity for this reduction. The law authorizes it and every patriot will readily acquiesce. The regiments dismounted by you will be organized into a division of infantry and sent to the support of the garrison at Galveston. I could have ordered these regiments temporarily dismounted and have placed them on the Island of Galveston, but I preferred dealing with them as men, as soldiers, and as patriots, believing that a manly appeal would convince them of the justice of the measure forced upon me by necessity. I promise that the horses taken for the Government shall be paid for from the first funds received.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH.

General.
