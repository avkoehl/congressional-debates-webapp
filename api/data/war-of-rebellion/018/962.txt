POPE.

[AUGUST -, 1862]-9.30.

Major-General McDOWELL:

GENERAL: General Tower has just thrown out skirmishers, and is preparing to push forward. He is about three-quarters of a mile from the cross-roads, and his skirmishers are a half a mile ahead. The battery section has taken up a good position a half mile to the rear.

H. STOCKTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

[AUGUST -, 1862]-9.45 a. m.

General McDOWELL:

We can discover a body of infantry, probably a brigade, about 3 miles off. They are stationary. We think the battery firing on Sigel is the same that opened on us this morning.

All quiet on our front.

RUFUS KING.

WATERY MOUNT, [August -, 1862]-10 a. m.
