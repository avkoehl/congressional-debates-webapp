Your dispatch is received. The district is being thoroughly patrolled as ordered. We have about 22,000 prisoners, and under present circumstances I should have more troops here.

Brigadier General J. P[. SLOUGH, Alexandria:

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS, Washington, D. C., April 15, 1865-4 a. m.

General SLOUGH, Military Governor:

The murderer of the President is undoubtedly J. Wilkes Booth, the actor. The other party is a smooth-faced man, quite stout. You had better have a squad of cavalry sent down toward the Occoquan to intercept anything crossing the river. The fishermen along the river should be notified and kept on the lookout.

C. C. AUGUR,Major-General.

ALEXANDRIA, April 15, 1865-5.20 a. m. (Received 5.20 a. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

GENERAL: All of the orders received during the night from you have been obeyed, except the sending of cavalry toward the Occoquan, which will be done as soon as a sufficient number can be assembled. The river and shore from Alexandria to Washington are abundantly patrolled, and all are active and vigilant. A tug-boat will start soon to notify the fisheries.

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

ALEXANDRIA, April 15, 1865. (Received 10 a. m.)

Major General C. C. AUGUR, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Is your order of 12.05 a. m. to me, to see that no one leaves the city until further orders, to be constructed strictly? Is it intended to prevent persons from going to Washington by the ferry-boat, or well known persons elsewhere?

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General.
