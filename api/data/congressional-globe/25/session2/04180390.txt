CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
hcopmion,to act onentire States, thanb> theslower
and more detailed plan of acting on section s, by
granting thctn appropriations for roads, rivers, &c
Hence this chang , m his opinion, m the plan of
the Opposition and American System party He
attributed it to no motives of economy on their
part, for that was a principle somewhat alien to
their policy, but to a design to use the veiy iimds
of the Government to break down those in power,
by professing to hold out more of liberality to-
wards the States In this point of view he had al-
ways regarded the possession of a surplus more as
a source of weakness than of patronage to those
in power By the dexterous use u hich the Oppo-
sition had been disposed to ma  e use oí it, it had
been m reality turned against the Administration,
and had been a soures ot patronage 10 those out
of power, to aid their designs in obtaining power
Mr B said, t'ierefore, on a review of the whole
course and policy of the two great political parties
in this country, that no impartial mind could fail
to arrive at the conclusion, that the policy of the
late and present Administration had, by favoring
a reduction of duties, and restricting appropna-
ttons for internal improvement", greatly piomoted
economy in the pubhe expenditures, in comparison
with the system ot extravagance -which would have
prevailed if the policy of the Opposition had suc-
ceeded It was not foi thote «ho had introduced
and established an exorbitant system ot duties and
taxes, by which large and unnecessary sums were
brought mto the Treasury, to reproach others with
extravagance The sin was in having unnecessa-
rily raised this money from th- people, that was
the mischief of which the public mostly complain-
ed, that was the real source ot extrpvagince, and
the great stimulus to it, no muter bv what party
committed, and its authois would be held accounta-
ble by the American people for a'I the conse-
quences Who they were, and to what party they
mainlj belonged, was matter of history. They had
done more to injure the purity and simplicity ot
our Govern nent than any other and every other
party which had heretofore sprung up m this
country
Mr WRIGHT observed that, holding as he dil
the particular position m relcence to this bill, he
was yet bound, out ot rtspect to the body, and his
anxiety for a speedy decís on, to deiy hmself the
privilege of replying to tut uiny misreprisenta-
t ons of the gentlemen o i the olhcr s de lie hi 1
yet hopes that the question woul I le taken this
evening, and in that hope he wiuld lei ain from
consuming tne time oí the Sprite iy ins\ enng
either of the gentlemen who had spoken against
the bill It was not necessary to take up the tune
ot the Senate by answering all the misrepresenta-
tions which had been made Some of them were
well understood, and would be easily corrected
For instance, we have been told, said he, that ten
millions of debt were contracted bv the bill of the
extra session, and that ten millions more were
asked for now. Now every gentleman knew that
ten mill ons could not be exceeded, and that not
one dollar of Treasury notes could be issued under
this bill, except to supply the pUce of a note that
had been redeemed and cmcelled "Wan íefereice
to the amendment proposing to reduce the issue of
Treasury notes to two iin" ons, he would observe
that there were the expend ti res under the General
Appropr ation and Navy bills to be provided for
and, m addition to that, a bill to meet the expense,
of the Florida war, must soon be expected here,
and from information they had, <it least two mil-
lions had been expended on that ol ject alone, and
that drafts to a large amount f r hat service were
w aitmg here for the neces ary appropn a on lo paj
th-m Could it, then, be expected that two mil-
lions would be enough1
After seme remarks from Messrs WCBSTER
and CIA Y,
Mr BENTON rose fcr the purpose o rnsweung
the question how the Tieasury caine to bo at pre-
sent out of money He shou'd be ab'e to answer
that question out of the book, and m such a way
that there should not be a man, wom-n, or child
m the country but wouid be able to understand it
It was because the Congress of 1836 distributed
among  the- States not only the surplus, but nine
millions of appropriated moneys [Mr B. here
lead the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
showing this fact ]
By the act of Congress of 1795, every appro-
priation made by Congress must remain two years
to be applied to the object for which it was appro-
priated, and then, if not applied for, it was to go
into the surplus fund Every human being knew
that money appropriated could not be «xpended m
a day. Now, when the bill of 1836 was passed, this
policy of ihe Government, established by the law
of '95, was violated, ard it took all the money
in the T-easury on a certain day, whether it
w as appropriated or not The distiibution law was
peremptory on that head, and divided the money,
not that which remained aftei answering the ap-
propriations, but that which was m the Treasury
on the first of January. The stave-off policy was
pursued then, a* now, and it was mid-summer be-
fore the appropriation bill was passed, and there-
fore, as he stated, there was a recapture oí the ap-
propriations Yes, sir, by this bill the appropria-
tions were recaptured on the last day ol December
He denounced the recapture at the time, and at
the ensuing session, when the report of the Secreta-
ry of the Treasury, showing thit $9,646,000
had been recaptured, he called for the ob-
jects f;r which the appropriations thus re-
captured had been made, ami a detailed state-
ment was made by the Secretary explaining them
These facts sue known to every gentleman he"e,
notwuhstandn g it is represented to the people that
the Treasury is destitute in consequence of extrava-
gance If he had known that these statements would
have been made, he would have piovided himself
with the document, and shown the portion of these
appiopnations that had been recaptured These
Treasury notes were now wanted to pay for them
He t( ok his stand, [Mr B said] with five or s x
others, against this Distribution bill, and he now
congratulated himself that he had done so The
consequences resulting from this bill had shown
that he was right He said at the time that it was
an illusion, that theie was no money, that it was
all bank credits, that would vanish into nothing as
soon as the banks were called upon. He remem-
bered a former occasion, when all this song of a
surplus was sung in the same key, and ended very
much in the same manner When he came into
Congress, in Mr Monroe's time, we had an income
oí forty millions, and a suiplus of nine mil-
lions, and in the next vtar theie was not a dol-
lai—no recaptuie In the first year he was
heie, ei¿ht millions were borrowed, and that
too within a >ear after Mr Monroe had called
on Congress to \now what to do with the surplus
He had risen to answer the question why the Trea
sury was out of money, and he had answered that
it was because of the recaplure of £>i>,646,000 by
the distribution act Another reason was that the
banks had suspended pajment with the money of
the Government in their vaults, and Congress had
given tune to pay ii m They had also extended
credit t) the merchants on the duty bonds due by
them—thus laying out of six millions of dollars,
another reason was hi cause thiy had divided
twent}-eight millions ..mong t^e States, and it was
in vain to bamboozle the public with any other
reasons
Mr TALLA1Í DGD recollected the word "bam-
boozled ' It ha 1 b en quote I by the Senator as
oltja in 1836 ?s to da), and was a kind of catch
phrase used for p'lmcal effect Mr T contended
that if the deposite law had gone into operation as
on nnaljy intended, all the present disasters would
ha/e been avoided Tne Sen tor from Missouri
has told us that he was proud he was one oí the six
that had stood up agairst that measure, and that he
nad warned gentlemen at .he time it tv ould destroy
the ba ii s. It so hapnened that two of the cashiers
of banks of New York had to'd him to take the
money out of their hands, and deposite it with the
Sta'es, and that conversation was what induced
him to mrl e a proposition lo that effect It was
well known the Piesident said he would veto such
p hill, and with this threat of the veto over ou
heads, the bill was not passed as originally drafted.
If it had, we should now have had any money that
we might have wanted, had it not been for Execu-
tive interference. Mr. T said, if this act had not
been passed, which arrested the eight or-nme mil-
lions that the Senator spoke of, where would the
gentlemen now have been if his magnificent
schemes of fortifications had been earned out? If
the report sent m by Secretary Cass had. not had the
effect to arrest this extravagant appropriation, in-
stead of now being called on for ten millions, we
should be required to give twenty or thirty millions,
Mr CRITTENDEN said he did not understand
how this nine millions was recaptufed.
Mr. BENTON  Here take the book and read it.
After some remarks fiom Mr  CRITTENDEN,
Mr. BENTON said he meant to speak oat of
the book, inasmuch as the Senator from New
York, [Mr. Tallmadgb,] had denied that the dis-
tribution act had contributed to the suspension of
the banks, and gave as his authority information
derived from gentlemen who were directors of two
of the New York banks. Now he had a report
made by Mr Albert Gallatin and others at a con-
vention of the city of New York banks, and as
that report was made for all of them, the two
banks alluded to by the Senator must have been of
the number. The report was made before a meet-
ing of all the banks of the city, and approved of
by the whole of them Mr B here read extracts
fiom the report, in which U is asserted that the im-
mediate cause which compelled the banks of New
York to suspend specie payments were well known
—they were the simultaneous withdrawal ol the
public deposites, etc
[Afier reading a few extracts, Mr B. continued ]
Now here was an enumeration of the causes
which produced a stoppage of the New York banks.
Four causes were given, and tne of them was the
simultaneous withdrawal of the public deposites,
etc. Now what caused the withdrawal of the pub-
lic deposites? It was caused by the distribution act,
and not by the Secretary of the 'lreasury, and the
report adopted at a meeting of all the banks, as-
signed this as the first cause This is what he as-
serted, and he was supported in the assertion by all
the banks of New York None of the extravagant
appropriations were mentioned in the report of the
New York banks His fortification bill was not
mentioned, and even the Specie Circular was not
thought of
Mr. CALHOUN said that the necessity of pass-
ing the Deposite act oí 1836 was so imperious, and
its benefit so manifest, that it required but little to
be said in its vindication Such was the urgency,
that it is well known many who were disinclined
to the measure felt compelled to give it their reluc-
tant support, as the only possible m- ans of extri-
cating the country from overwhelming difficulties,
and ot saving any portion of the immense -surplus
that had accumulated in the Tre?sury, and which
was still daily augmenting. If there had been no
other argument m Us favor, the one which is so
clearly s'ated and forcibly urged in the late report
of the Finance Committee on the resolutions of the
Senator from Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] was all-suffi-
cient That document clearly prov es, as was urged
at the tune, that a vicious circle had been formed
from the deposite banks to the speculators m lands,
and from them to the land offices, and thence again
to the banks, hy which millions on millions oi the
choicest portions ot the puoltc domain were, at
every revolution, passed from the peop'e to the
speculators foi worm hss bank note" Every time
the wheel went round, the surplus was increased,
and the capacity for another and more sweep ng re-
volution augmented m the same proportion. The
Deposite act, by withdrawing the fund  from the
banks, and placing them m ihe safe-keeping of the
States, cut and destroyed this circle, and broke
down the speculation, which, if it had continued
another year unchecked, would have transferred
most of the public lands worth having from the Go-
vernment to those whom the banks might choose to
designate It did more it saved the large amount«
w ich w as withdraw  from the banks, and safely
deposited with the States, much of which, without
it, must necessarily have been lost
But we are told that the withdiawal of the funds
from the banks was the cause of the suspension of
specie payment That the manner m which it was
done accelerated that event, he did not doubt; bntu
