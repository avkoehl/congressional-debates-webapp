Major General B. HUGER, Commanding at Norfolk, Va.

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of the 8th instant I would state that it is myintention to permit Mr. Jones to proceed to Norfolk in a few days. Special reasons have prevented me from doing so sooner, but no restrictions whatever have been placed jpon Mr. Jones and he has been at perfect liberty at all times to leave this post for Baltimore or elsewhere in the North. Should Mr. Ector be sent to Old Point I will permit him to proceed to Norfolk by flag of truce and if desirable you can notify his friends to this effect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CAIRO,Fort Henry, Tenn., February 10, 1862.

Captain J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.

CAPTAIN: After writing the dispatch to General Halleck suggesting the propriety of paroling the prisoners of war (commissioned officers) at Paducah, Ky., I received such reports of their conduct as to make me believe it was not prudent to leave them within our lines so near the enemy. Paducah being the home of General Tilghman makes it particularly objectionalbe, and I therefore gave orders before the receipt of Major-General Halleck's reply for the removal of all these prisoners to Saint Louis or suchother place as the department commander might direct. I hope this will meet with approval.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel D. STUART, Commanding U. S. Forces, Paducah, Ky.:
