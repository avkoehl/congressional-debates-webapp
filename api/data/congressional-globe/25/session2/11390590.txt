It is roundly a'ser fdbv the chairman of the Committee of

the country has been flooded, under the frank of members of
Congress of Executive officcis, and of tht President himself,
contained nothing but arrant falsehoods, and that tlws was so
understood by the people If there was believed to be one
word of tiuth in them, the banks could not resume
When the chairman makes this assertion, are we to under

is not necessary It is sufficient, if there be enough to meet
the calls of tiade and public convenience, the reuaindtr of

that the resources of the banks, in claims upon solvent bor

snnct-s be safely assumed But what beco nes of it when the
avowed policy of the Administration invites and demands a
tun upon the bai ks] The very pel sons who talk oí the for
heaiance which would result fiom public confidence, are those
who now strive to bla^t th it confidence, hy preaching up ut
tci, uncompromising distrust What is the whole theory of
the expeiimenf I-, it not that confidence m any bank is mis
placed, and full of penll How is a proselyte to it made but
by ¡ etsuadng him that his modicum 0 f inter est m the public
treasure is insecure so long as papershall be received? And
if you Riicceel m fixing these apprehensions upon him, can
it be supposed that the same individual will leave Ins pnvate

him to feel restless and uneasy whilst he has a banl no e m

Who that is oblige! to go t > th" bank to get a note changed,
in Older to pay speue to the Government, will not, at the

SPEECH OF MR. MASON,
Of Virginia,
In the Sfoute of Representatives,   May 12, 1838—On the
Treasury Note Bill
Mr   EoBKftTSON having moved an amendment to the Trea
sury note bill, proposing to substitute a provision authorizing a
loan for the provision authorizing the issue of Treasury notes—
the hour oeing late, and the Committee of the Whol* refusing
motions to rise-
Mr MASON, of Virginia, rose and addressed the House as
follows;
This bill, Mr Chanman, is intended to furnish to the Treasury
the sum of ten millions of dollars, in aid ofthe current revenue
It is Pimply a bill for supply, and as such I shall treat it, avoiding
all collateral matter, the example of the honorable chairman of
Ways and Means, who biought it in, to the contrary notwitk
standing
We are told, and I believe correctly, that the Government
wants so much money, a  one ofthe representatives of the peo-
ple, 1 am willing to grant it, and thus to me there lemains the
single inquiry, what is the beet means of raising ifí T his ques
tion 1 shall discuss T am bound to do so, because it has been
the pleasure of the chairman of the Ways and Means, in his re-
ports asking the supply, to avoid such discussion altogether
He has been content with declaring that the deficiency mthe
íevenue "must be provided for, either by an authority to re
issue the Treasury notes received, or by an is&ue of others in
their place " And this word "must," having the same lgnifi
cant u^e, is found appropriately alike in hie íeporte of the 5th
and 230 of March
Sir, let me say to the honorable chairman, that in f report ad
dressed to the intelligence of the representatives of the people,
and leastofall when asking a supply, this word "must* 13 not
parliamentary English His the language of Courts, but has
no place in Parliament I should have thought u his duty, m
recommending the supply, to canvass before us the best and
most economical means, of raising it The financial condition
of the country, as well a¡* of the Titasury is familiar to his
mind, we have a right to expect fiom him an exposition of the
"ways and means" of supply, when, in lieu, we have nothing
but an imperative monosyllable
This, sir, is adepartme fiom usage Former committees, in
laying before the country the necessities of an extraordinary
supply, to meet a deficient revenue, have thought it their duty
to present fully the several modes of railing it whether by taxa
tion, loan or an issue of Treasury notes, and to recommend that
which, undei the circumstances, to them might seem best
Our chairman, however, thinking otherwise, it is our righf,
as it is our duty, to consider this subject fully, and with tht Lest
lights v\e can command, each for himself and this would seem
the more necessary because, notwithstanding the whole inquiry
is shaken off by the committee in the use of their confident mo
nosylUble, yet it "siemarkable that the leeemmendation comes
fiom them at last m the most crude and undigested foim They
were not themselves satisfied with the results of their own rea
somng Let me trace, for a moment, this vacillation of pur
pose, not so much, sir, with a view of confuting them, but to
show the propriety of full consideration by this Hout-e
We have then first, the bill ot the 23d of March, cntt led, "A
bill to authorize the issuing of Treasury n tes" accompanied
by a report at length This bill provides for an l^sue of
$16,000,000 of Treasury notes payable one third in twelve one
third in eighteen months, and the residue in two years after their
date, to bear interest not exceeding six per cent per annum,
and to be redeemable at maturity at the Treasuiy, ibi which
redemption certain funds are specifically pledged m ihe bill
Thia is a loan out and out, to be effected by a sale of Treasury
scrip, bearing interest, redeemable at stated periods during
which it was to run and not in the m*an time receivable in
payment of public dues
In the report accompanying this bill, (our printed document
No 71$,) much reasoning is used to show that, by the nnfortu
nate provisions of the act of the special session, for theisoue of
Tieasuiy notes it#had exercised an lmpoveiishmg instead of an
invigorating influence upon the Treasury I nderthat act, i is
said, th issue of $10,000000hadoperated a retZwcíío?*-,m Ii u of
an augmentation of the revenue, and this reduction ofthe te
venue, so brought about, wab to be tJiovided foi by a r evv is^ue
under the proposed bi'l
One not versed m the mystene* ot finance, as the honorab'e
chairman is, would be a little curious to know row anextraor
dniiuy supply of 4*10 000000 maid of tho current revenue could
reduce instead of increasing it Put, having ascertained the
fact,u was his duty to trace out the causes, however perpiexjed
the problem might be, and he has act oidme'y defected and ex
posed theoffending mitter After capitulating certa'n extraor
dinary demands upon the Tteasmv, arming out of the Ln^ran
wars and the tioubleson the ( añada homier, he says Not
withstanding theoe addit onal e«tinntes the runent resources
of the year would, with proper economy, be equal to all tie
demands upon the Tieasury, whether lor oiihnnry or extra
ordinary purposes, but for two provisions ofthe Treasury n He
actiefeired o, the one author izmg their receipt inpayment of
public dues and the other piohibitmg the Treasury irom leis
sun g them "
\\ ell, sir, this bill for a loan took the reg nai course of a fir-t
and s-eeadreadme on the day that it wa= biought m, and was
referred to the Committee of the Whole
Belore anv furthei action was bad upon it, there was brouafet
in fr«m the same committee a &ecoil eititled "A bill «•uptjlen en
taiy to the act enti'led an act to authorize the fosue ol Treasuiy
notes,"íeported on the 13th April Tms wasm like rnanmn
twice rea 1, m 1 ref«ned with its predecessor
Thin"  so íeinaired, withoi t action 01 either, until the23d of

tie close (if rt 'nig day a debite uf on 1 * liferent subject, th*

Thus we have had, in the short t.p*tce of ons nionui, rui ui^g
from the 23d day of March to the ^d of April, three several
schemes for supply, repotted from the Committee ol Ways
and Mear'a, each variant irom the other, and ta^fc piopo^na
