CROSSING OF THE BALTIMORE PIKE AND RAILROAD, July 9, 1864. (Received 11. 40 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I fought the enemy at Frederick Junction from 9 a. m . till 5 p. m., when they overwhelmed me with numbers. I am retreating with a foot-sore, battered, and half-demoralized column. Forces of the enemy at least 20,000. They do not seem to be pursuing. You will have to use every exertion to save Baltimore and Washington. Colonel Seward, son of the Secretary, is wounded, and is a prisoner. Brigadier-General Tyler is a prisoner. I think the troops of the Sixth Corps fought magnificently. I was totally overwhelmed by a force from the direction of Harper's Ferry arriving during the battle. Two fresh regiments of the Sixth Corps are covering my retreat. I shall try to get to Baltimore.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.
