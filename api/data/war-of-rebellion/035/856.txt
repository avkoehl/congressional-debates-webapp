SPRING HILL, June 1, 1863-9 p. m.

General BRAGG:

My scouts report the enemy's cavalry all moved to the front of Murfreesborough. Rosecrans' headquarters are at Nashville. All the streets are being blockaded; cutting ditches and placing sand-bags. They intend to move either forward or backward.

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SPRING HILL, June 1, 1863-10 p. m.

General BRAGG:

My scouts have just returned from Franklin, and report the enemy have released all the citizen prisoners and are under marching orders. I will move up in the morning as near Franklin as possible, and remain as near the enemy as prudent, and would like the balance of the cavalry to move up, if you think it advisable.

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
