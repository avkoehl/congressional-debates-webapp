After the charge the recruits speedily rallied, and I again reported in line of battle to the commanding general. General Fagan then assumed command, retained me still as a support to the rear. The troops under my command behaved well even if they had been armed veterans. As unarmed recruits they distinguished themselves. During their whole march there is no known instance of lawlessness. In all the demoralization they have behaved well. No insubordinate spirit has been developed. They have reported in greater numbers for duty, comparatively, than any other brigade.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Major H. EWING,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Marmaduke's Division.
