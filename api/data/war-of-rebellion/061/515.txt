means, and when the enemy is already in the vitals of the department, is a policy I am too obtuse to understand. There is no position short of the head of Spanish Lake, 18 miles from here, where I can undertake to do anything with my present means. In fact, Pleasant Hill, with an effort to hold the country to Blair's Landing, is the only position where I can await Green's forces and secure subsistence and forage. The enemy is in formidable numbers, prepared to overrun the Red River Valley, and he must and will succeed unless all a the means at our disposal are used energetically to prevent him. I most respectfully call attention to the fact that sixteen days after he fall of Fort De Russy and the opening of the campaign by the enemy only 250 re-enforcements have reached me.

Your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Brigadier-General BOGGS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I left Natchitoches to-day at 11 a.m., just before the head of the enemy's column reached the place. I am on the steamer Frolicc, and shall proceed to Blair's to inspect the road to Pleasant Hill, at which place the main body of my troops will encamp to-night. General Liddell has been ordered to throw the larger portion of Harrison's brigade on the river at an above Campti, with a battery of artillery. I propose placing artillery below Blair's on the west side. By this means I hope to secure navigation down to Blair's and thus sustain the troops at or near Pleasant Hill. From all I can learn, it will be ten days before Green's command will reach me one regiment under Major McPhaill having alone come up. The troops ordered here from Texas, excepting Green's original division, have been directed to halt in Polk County until further orders, so I am informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Hearbert. If this be true, Green will bring me less than 2,000 men. Had I conceived for an instant that such astonishing delay would ensue before re-enforcements reached me I would have fought a battle even against the heavy odds. It would have been better to lose the State after a defeat than surrender it without a fight. The fairest and richest portion of the Confederacy is now a waste. Louisiana may well know her destiny. Her children are exiles; her labor system is destroyed. Expecting every hour to receive the promised re-enforcements, I did not feel justified in hazarding a general engagement with my little army. I shall never cease to regret the error.

Your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.
