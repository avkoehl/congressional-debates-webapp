PENSION TO MIU3. LINCOLN,
Mr. SUMNER. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of the bill (S. Â£io. lit]
granting a pension to Mary Lincoln, widow oj
Abraham Lincoln, late President of the United
States.
The motion was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill ia be-
fore the Senate as in Committee of the Whole,
I and will be read,
The Secretary read the bill. It provides that
Mary Lincoln, widow of Abraham Lincoln, late
President of the United States, shall ree&iTea
pension of $6,000 annually, to be paid from
the date of the death of her husband.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think that is a subject
that merits inquiry by a committee. If this
lady is not destitute, and enjoys affluence or
comfort, then it may be that it will be entirely
unjust to give her this sum to the exclusion of
other widows of soldiers. If on the contrary,
as is represented, as I hear within a day or
two, she is in destitute circumstances and is
absolutely in want, it will undoubtedly be
proper for the Government to do something
for her. in that view 1 move that the bill be
referred to the Committee on Pensions.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, 1 hope that
that, motion will not prevail. The bill at the
last session was referred to the Committee on
Pensions, which reported it back to the Senate
for consideration. I have 110 reason to sup-
pose that it would receive any different report
from the committee at this session. Still far-
ther, sir, there is no occasion for reference to
any committee. The question is so simple
that it does not need any inquiry or report. I
hope, therefore-, that the Senate will proceed at
once to vote upon it without any reference, and
so far as I am concerned I would say without
any speeches.
Mr. TIPTON. As a member of the Com-
mittee on Pensions 1 was not present with the
committee at the time of its action in, this case.
I am anxious to do what is right in the prem-
ises. 1 wish an opportunity to look into the bill
thoroughly and entirely, and therefore I am
anxious that it go to the committee that I may
have an opportunity of investigating it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion of the Senator from Vermont
to refer the bill to the Committee on Pensions.
Mr. SUMNER called for the yeas aud nays ;
and they were ordered.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to say one word
in reply to my friend from Massachusetts. He
says that this is a perfectly simple qsestion. He
fixes by his own will the sum of $5,000 a year
as exactly the sum, no more and no less, that
we are to give to this lady. Now, does it not
merit inquiry whether that is the proper sum
in view of all the circumstances? There are
a great many other widows ot sufferers from
this rebellion in the land who only have thirty
dollars a month, fifty dollars the very highest;
the great majority of them only fifteen, twenty,
and ten dollars. Now, are we to say, without
a single fact before this body reported by any
inquiry from a committee, that this sum of
$â¢5,000 for the life of a lady per year is to be
voted away 1 It may be that it will turn out
when all the facts arc known that it is perfectly
right; it may be that it will turn out, let me
say to the Senator from Massachusetts, that it
is entirely wrong ; and are we to set the pre-
cedent of refusing to have an investigation into
the propriety of the principle and the amount
on the spur of the enthusiasm of my friend
from Massachusetts ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion to refer the bill to the Commit-
tee on Pensions, oil which the yeas and nays
have been ordered.
: The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resultedâyeas ol, nays 27 ; as follows:
