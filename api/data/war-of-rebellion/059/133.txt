The mounted force of Fifty-second at Scottsville and part of Thirty-seventh Kentucky have been ordered to act in concert with Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry. I have offered the scattered rebels in that country who have belonged to any regiment the privilege of coming in under the amnesty proclamation or being exchanged.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
