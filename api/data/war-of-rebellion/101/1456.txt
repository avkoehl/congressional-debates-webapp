LEWISVILLE, ARK., March 31, 1865.

Major-General PRICE,

Washington, Ark.:

GENERAL: I inclose an extra of the Natchitoches Times of 25th instant, which, though rather old, is yet of interest; first, because it shows how the recognition rumors we had some days since originated; second, it contains General Lee's report of the fight between Generals Hampton and Kilpatrick, of which we have heretofore had only rumors; and, third, it shows that, notwithstanding the contradiction received here, General Early did have a fight with Sheridan and was worsted, losing prisoners, &amp;c., as mention is made in our papers of an effort to recapture the prisoners. Doctor Taylor received a letter this morning from Doctor Burton, dated Camden, 30th, saying that a Northern paper of the 20th had been received and that no battle had been fought up to that time. No mention of foreign news was made by Doctor Burton and it is to be presumed the paper continued none.

Very respectfully,

B. DAVIDSON.
