The whole amount of expenditure from 1829 to
1837, inclusive, is $ 184,937,479 The average
annual expenditure lot  the same yean amount
to................................$20,550,831
'1 lie whole amount expended fiom

iture during the same years amounts
to.............................12,625,477
Annual average e^c ess of the last nine
over former lour years............    7,925,354
From this deduct average annual ex-
cess oí ceilain items of expenditure
during nine yeais, over annual sums
expended on same account during
said period of foui years, and for
which the Administration is not
properly chargeable or responsible,
vu:
The annual average excess of pen-
sions................£,1,013,738
Of expenses of Indian de-
partment ............1,125,942
Of trust funds for Indians,
and indemnities from for-
eign Powers..........     568,333

Ot expenditures on account
of Judian wars, Black
Hawk, Creek, and Semi-
nole, amounting in all to
$13,500,000,pnortol838, 1,722,222
--------------5,185,438
Which leaves the true annual excess, $2,739,916
No reasonable man would attempt to hold the
Adminístranos responsible for the items of ex-
penditure above deducted. Were such an attempt
made, it would be futile. The Administration is
no more chargeable for the increase of pensions,
for payments of revolutionary claims, balances
due States, or repayment of duties on drawbacks
and debentures, than for the payment of the na-
tional debt. The trust funds are properly no
expenditure at all; and so far as concerns the in-
demnities from foreign Governments, which con-
stitute the greater portion of these funds, they are
clear gains to the country, and not expenditures.
By the terms of then admission the new States are
entitled to a per cent of the proceeds of the public
lands given in consideration of their agreement
not to tax these lands The amount which they
receive annually from this fund depends on the
quantity sold of the public land, for which the Ad-
ministration is not responsible. In 1836 the pro-
ceeds of public lands was swelled to $24,877,000.
JThia item, therefore, is properly deducted For
the expenditures of the Indian department, being
on account of purchases of Indian lands, the Ad-
mimstiation is not more responsible than was Mr.
Jefferson foi the fifteen millions paid for Louisiana,
or Mr. Monroe for the five millions paid to Spam
for Florida The census and increase in the num-
ber of judges and other officers, from an exten-
sion of the circuit courts, &c , to the new States,
constitute charges of necessity, for which the
Administration is not blamable For the money
expended in the Indian wars, the Administration
is not more blamable or responsible than was
Mi Madison foi the expenses of the late war
with Great Britain. In these expenditures, there-
fore, there is no "profligate extravagance, no
corrupt feeding of Treasury rats "
The remainder of the average annual excess of
expenditure is composed in part of the average
annual excess of expenditure for the same nine
years over average annual expenditures for the
same items during thefourprecedingyears, to wit-
Navy establishment.................   $415,995
Armories, arsenals, barracks, and
quarters.........................     103,000
Ordnance and ordnance stores........       63,366
Fortifications......................      149,110
Congress and punting for Congress...     181,777
Light houses.......................      95,000
Intel nal im pi ovements, including rivers,
creeks, harbors, <Lc , and excluding
Alexandria canal and Potomac bridge    321,000
Total annual average excess for these
items...........................$1,399,054
Which deducted from the general annual aveiage
excess of £2,739,910, leaves an average annual
excess still lemaming of $1,340,862
Another principal item of inciease, that of sur-
veys, is not included The excess of expenditure
for the various items first above cited was, in
part, thrown upon the Administration by its suc-
cess and good fortune, as in case of the foreign
indemnities and the various purchases of Indian
londs, in part by national misfortunes, as in case
of the several Indian wars. Butall of them either
support themselves, as in case of the three and
five per cent fund paid to new States, or are
temporary in their character, having already ex-
pired or being shortly to expire The aggregate
amount of excess for the last-named items for
nine years is $12,067,758 greater than would be
the amount ol expenditure on same account in
nine years, at the rate of expenditure therefor,
from 1825 to 1828 inclusive. How far the people
may be disposed to sanction this increase when
they come to consider the wonderful growth of
this mighty nation, I leave them to determine.
A large portion of it is not such as I approve
myse f, but whatever may be the decision of the
people respecting this matter, the Opposition are
wholly precluded fiom blaming or abusing the
Administration for this increase The measures
by which it has been effected have generally re-
ceived their strongest support fiom the Opposi-
tion, and gentlemen of that party cannot with
more reason hold the Administration responsible
therefor than for the deposit of $28,101,000 with
the States, which leceived the most cordial sup-
port of the Opposition The greatest inciease in
these items has grown out of large appropriations
for internal improvements, light-houses, and the
Navy, the increase in the last being partly attrib-
utable to the exploring expedition. For light-
houses and improvements on roads, canals, rivers,
and sea coast, the Opposition have always voted,
and are always demanding more The Secretary
of the Treasury, in his last annual report, sug-
gested a retrenchment in expenditures for these
objects, noticing, at the same time, that they were
rapidly increasing every year to an extent un-
warranted and impolitic. How was this responded
to by the Opposition' The whole party abused
him for suggesting the retrenchment, and some
of them made the usual charge that he was at-
tempting to dictate to Congress " Our commerce
must be broken down," says the party organ in
this city, " but not one of the Treasury leeches
of the Administration departments to be dispensed
with " I quote from memoiy, but this is the
substance of the editorial remark. How far the
clerks in the several departments might be cur-
tailed in number, or whether curtailed at all, I do
not know. But one thing I do know: the aug-
mentation of public business in those departments
has been, within the last ten years, beyond all
conception, and I discover that business in many
of them is always in arrear. The business in the
Land Office department, since the administration
of Mr. Adams, from the entry of public lands
alone, has increased tenfold, and there must be
something like a corresponding increase in most
of the other departments There has been more
than a corresponding increase in the labors im-
posed upon them by this and the other branch of
Congress, which have now become onerous m
the extreme. One of the items of annual excess
of expenditure submitted in the foregoing state-
ment is that of Congress and printing for Con-
gress, the annual excess over average annual
expendituie therefor, under Mr Adams's admin-
istration, being $181,777. This is owing, in part,
to the great number of resolutions passed by this
or the other House of Congress, calling upon the
departments for copies of papers, lecords, corre-
spondences, &c , under the plea of information.
Look at your executive documents of last session,
mostly made up in this way, and reaching the
enormous dimensions of twelve volumes in the
House and six in the Senate, in all, eighteen
volumes, each one as laige as the " big hall
Bible." They have to be copied by the cleiKS
in the Departments, and then printed, (some of
them several times over,) bound, and distributed.
Is it any wonder that so many clerks are re-
quired, when all this is superadded to their ordin-
ary and official duties' Instances are common
of ten or a dozen clerks being at work for several
months to prepare an answer to a single call But
the other day I read the published note of the
Solicitor of the Treasury, stating that he had
directed the labor necessary to answer a single
call to be examined and estimated, and that it
would take an expert clerk five years and some
months to copy the papers It la notorious that
seven eighths of these calls are made by Opposi-
tion members, and that two thirds of the docu-
ments obtained in answer are scarcely ever exam-
ined even by the member making thecal!. Who,
then, are most responsible for the increase of clerk
service, and for the swollen expenditures of
Congress > Why, su, it has taken four hundred
reams of paper to envelope thiee speeches alone
of the Opposition, besides the labor of pages,
messengeis, superintendents, &c, in folding and
preparing the huge mass for the frank. 1 allude
to the speech of Mr Binncy, of Philadelphia, at
the panic session in 1834, and the speeches of a
distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Webster,] and of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Bond,] during the last session. Now, sir, 1 am
not complaining of all this, but are the friends of
the Administration to be charged with all this
extravagance' If we make the least show of
resistance against these numerous calls on the
Departments, we are instantly charged by fifty
voices with an attempt to suppress information
which would subject us to exposure, and that we
evince a disposition to remain in tne dark " be-
cause our deeds are evil "
Sir, (said Mr. M ,) until I was more familiar
with the manner in which things are done here, 1
was at a loss to know how an argument, solely
for party effect, could be made out, with all the
plausibility of truth, giving facts and figures, and
