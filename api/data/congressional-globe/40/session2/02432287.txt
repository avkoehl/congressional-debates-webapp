And whereas further, it appears by said advertise-
ment that the sale of the said steamship Atlantic has

Be it resolved. That the Secretary of the Navy be
directed to report to this House all tho facts and cir-
cumstances connected with tho mortgage held by tho
United States on the said steamship Atlantic, and tho
reasons why the said sale of tho said steamship has
been postponed for so long a time; whero the said

impeachment of the president.
Mr. ROBINSON. I ask consent to offer a
resolution, which I think the Speaker will rule
to be privileged, when it shall have been read.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolved, That tho resolution of impeachment
against Andrew Johnson, President of the United
States, passed February 24,1868, and the proceedings
of this House amendatory thereof, or supplemental
thereto, be, and the same are hereby, rescinded, and
that the managers be recalled.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will rule that
this resolution is not privileged at this time,
and for this reason : the House is now acting
under the previous question, which was pend-
ing at the adjournment or. the 31st of March.
The House at that time had under considera-
tion a resolution reported by the gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Laflin,] from the
Committee on Printing, to print an extra
number of copies of the argument of Manager
Butler. The motion of the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Chanler] tolaytheresolution
on the table was voted down; the previous
question was seconded, and the pending ques-
tion now is '' Shall the main question be now
put?" and no other business is now in order,
except by unanimous consent.
Mr. ROBINSON. Then I call for the reg-
ular order.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I move
that the House now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at twelve o'clock and fifteen minutes p. m.)
the House adjourned.
