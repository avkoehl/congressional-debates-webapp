no guard at bridge 3 miles north of Pulaski. See to it. The bridge guards cannot do patrol duty. Captains Bell and Bostwick and Lieutenant McMillen, Seventy-fourth Ohio, reported as absent on 12th and 13th. Have facts ascertained and report them. Arrest the officers if they were absent unjustifiably.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 15, 1862.

General NELSON, McMinnville:

Rebel accounts of affair at Tazewell are false. The facts are as follows: Morgan send De Courcy's brigade to Tazewell to reconnoiter and get forage; they procured 200 loads, and had a slight skirmish on 5th; on morning of 6th, as he was returning, De Courcy was attacked, not vigorously, considering vastly superior force of enemy. Our object was accomplished and the affair a success. We had but one brigade and a section of artillery. Loss not serious. Nothing has occurred there since. It is of highest importance for you to verify the report of Bragg's movement to Richmond; spare no labor, means, or money to do so. Send General Jackson at once to report to General Boyle in Kentucky to command a light brigade for active operations.

General BUELL:

I ordered Wolford's cavalry to proceed to Liberty, where General Johnson was waiting for him with two other regiments to cut off Morgan's retreat. General Cruft writes me that the order was countermanded from headquarters. I ask that Wolford may be sent; also that I may be notified when my orders are countermanded, that I may take the precautions necessary. Can I get supplies from Murfreesborough?

Are you looking after your guards and the bridge defenses? What condition are they in?

General THOMAS:

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
