Brigadier General D. W. ADAMS,

Selma:

Take steps to prevent the capture of any more trains. Steele with large force was near Mobile last evening. It is possible that the force moving up is only cavalry sent to cut railroad. Your cavalry should be thrown forward from Montgomery.

Brigadier General D. W. ADAMS,

Selma or Montevallo:

Report progress made moving stores, &amp;c., ordered east from Montgomery and steps taken to execute orders relative to cotton at Selma and Montgomery. No delay must occur in sending east everything ordered. The few stores remaining after these shipments can, when necessary, be brought away by boat to Selma, if you find it impracticable to send them east by railroad. It is possible enemy may be moving around to Claiborne instead of on Montgomery directly. Your attention is called to necessity of furnishing these headquarters earliest information possible.

Your telegrams this date received. In view of movements from Russellville and Moulton, your order for Jackson to move via Tuscaloosa is right. Jackson with his own and Lyon's command should meet, whip, and get rid of that column of enemy soon as possible. Wirt Adams and Scott's forces ought to be able to dispose of any enemy advancing toward Columbus or from Mississippi River. Think will have in few days 800 or 1,000 Reserves to re-enforce Wirt Adams or Hodge, at Jackson, as circumstances may require. Our only plan is to meet and whip these detached columns before they can unite with each other. You had better, soon as possible, move via Meridian to Selma, whence you can assume direction of Jackson's, Chalmers', and Buford's movements. Telegraph when can expect you here, as lieutenant-general commanding will either precede or accompany you to Selma.
