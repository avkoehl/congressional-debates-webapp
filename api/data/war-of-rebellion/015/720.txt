One of the largest store-houses in the town had been appropriated by the United States medical purveyor, and was filled with medicines, instruments, and hospital stores. The supply was very large, and intended, as I was told by the Federal surgeons, for the armies under the command of Generals Shields and Fremont, as well as that of General Banks. Most of the instruments and some medicines (badly needed at that time by our army) were issued to the surgeons and the rest sent to Charlottesville, Va., where they were turned over to a medical purveyor. No invoice was made of them. There were also two large, very well furnished hospitals accommodating about 700 patients. The stores in these hospitals were left for the use of the sick and wounded Federals, and a few of your own men, who were too ill or badly wounded to be removed.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
