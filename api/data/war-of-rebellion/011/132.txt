NASHVILLE, April 27, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have just received a dispatch from President Lincoln in answer to a dispatch in which I pressed the importance of a force at this point sufficient to exert not only a military but a moral power throughout Tennessee, which would be most satisfactory upon the public mind. I also pressed the propriety of the Sixty-ninth Ohio Volunteers, Colonel Campbell, being located at this place, and which was ordered by the Secretary of War. There were many reasons given for this request.

The President informs me that the substance of this dispatch has been transmitted, and by this time it is expected you would be in comminution with me. If the dispatch has been received, I hope and trust that General Halleck will find it consistent with the public service to grant the request made. In regard to the amount of force to be left at this point, to be disposed of as circumstances may require, I simply ask that at least Colonel Campbell's Sixty-ninth Ohio Regiment may remain here, not only for reasons of public consideration, but for reasons peculiar to myself. The President requested that I should at once telegraph you thus freely. Please favor me with an early reply. I wish you complete success in the coming contest. Accept assurances of my high esteem and respect.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Major General C. F. Smith died at 4 p. m. on the 25th. His remains have been sent to Saint Louis, where they will be buried with military honors. He is a great loss to this army. I have not directed military honors to be paid to his memory here, but will wait your orders.

Transportation is rapidly arriving, and as soon as the roads can be made passable we shall move. The enemy has been strongly re-enforced since the last battle.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
