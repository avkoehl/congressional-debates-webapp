The enemy's sharpshooters are very annoying here. The mist now interferes with observations. The enemy has a battery of six guns bearing directly on this point.

PIERCE,

Captain, Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS Army of the Potomac, July 3, 1863-8. 30 a. m.

General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

I presume you are advised of the condition of affairs here by copies of my dispatches to the General-in-Chief. The result of my operations may be the withdrawal of the rebel army. The sound of my guns for these three days, it is taken for granted, is all the additional notice you need to come on. Should the enemy withdraw, by prompt co-operation we might destroy him. Should he overpower me, your return and defense of Harrisburg and the Susquehanna is not at all endangered.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 3, 1863-9. 57 p. m.

(Copy received, War Department, July 4, 8. 40 a. m.)

Major General D. N. COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

You will be apprised of my operations through my dispatch to the General-in-Chief. I do not think Lee will attack me again, but am as yet uncertain whether he will assume an offensive attitude, and await an attack from me, or whether he will withdraw down the Cumberland Valley, holding strongly the mountain passes, which, I understand, he has fortified. Should the former be the case, I will apprise you of the facts so soon as I am certain of it, and I then desire you either to form a junction with me, or, if in your judgment the same can be done without jeopardizing the safety of your command, attack him. Should I be satisfied that he is retreating, I shall then move down on this side of the mountain, and wish you to pursue him as rapidly as possible down the Valley.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

JULY 3, 1863-10. 05 a. m.

GENERAL MEADE:

I have placed Shaler's brigade in position. The other brigades sent me I do not think I shall need.

SLOCUM,

Major- General.
