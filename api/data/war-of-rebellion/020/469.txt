His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

SIR: You cannot fail to be aware that my removal from the command of the Department of the South has been all but universally regarded as a censure on my conduct while in that command.

Satisfied and well knowing that I acted throughout in strict obedience to orders, and that my record when published will prove an ample vindication of my course, I now respectfully request of you liberty to make such publication of official documents and records as may be necessary to set me right in the eyes of my friends and in the justice of history. The time has now passed when any injurious effect to the public service could possibly arise from such publication.

Knowing how greatly your time is occupied, I shall regard your silence in reply to this note as giving me the liberty I ask and will act accordingly. Should you deem such publications as I propose unadvisable, will you be kind enough to notify me of your opinion without delay?

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
