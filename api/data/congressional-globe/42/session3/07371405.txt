have instructed me to report it back without
amendment, and recommend its passage ; and
I should like very much to have it put upon its
passage now.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Let it go on the Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
placed on the Calendar.
Mr. WRIGHT, from the Committee on
Claims, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 3860) for the relief of William Ruther-
ford, of Washington, submitted an adverse
report, which was ordered to be printed ; and
the bill was postponed indefinitely.
Mr. WRIGHT. The same committee, to
whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 3875) for
the relief of Christopher Weidner, Henry Heg-
wer, Moise Bellmard, Louis Paschall, Aaron
Grigsby, Harvey L. Bickford, and Thomas
Stanley, composing the firm of Bickford &
Stanley, claiming compensation for depreda-
tions to their property by Indians, have in-
structed me to report it back. We find that
the bill contemplates that there is to be so
much money paid to these persons out of the
Treasury of the United States, and not with-
held from any annuity due the Indians. Inas-
much as we are opposed to the bill in its form,
and should recommend its indefinite postpone-
ment in this shape, I am instructed to report
it back with a recommendation that, it be re-
ferred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, so
that it may be examined by them ; and if they
find that annuities are due to these Indians,
they can consider the question of the propri-
ety of paying for these depredations out of
such annuities or any sum that may be due
these Indians. At present I only report the
bill back and ask that the Committee on
Claims be discharged from its further consid-
eration, and that it be referred to the Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs.
The report was agreed to.

tories, reported an amendment to the bill (H.
