THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 16,
I have already shown that the expenditures
for the year, exclusive of payments grow-
ing out of the public debt, cannot exceed
$166,132,378 82. Deduct that amount from
$214,124,066 43, and you have of unexpended
balances $47,991,687 61.
I have made these statements and calcula-
tions without reference to the payment of a
portion of the public debt and the interest and
the premiums thereon. Evidently this is the
only true rule for testing the economy or ex-
travagance of an Administration. The present
Administration did not incur the present debt.
Payment of the interest thereon, or of any por-
tion of the principal thereof, is in no just
sense an expenditure of the Administration.
It is but the disbursement of money in dis-
charge of a preexisting obligation.
But even if the gentleman intended to in-
clude in his statement of $400,000,000 all
moneys disbursed and to be disbursed during
the present fiscal year, whether in payment
of the ordinary expenditures or in the dis-
charge of interest on the debt, I think he will
be wholly unable to show expenditures to any
such amount as $400,000,000. I think I have
shown very clearly that tne expenditures for
the present year, exclusive of payments ap-
pertaining to the public securities, cannot
exceed $100,132,378 82. If you add to that
amount $128,690,676, appropriated for the
payment of interest, you lind only the sum of
$294,823,054 82.
Mr. Speaker, I have judged it proper to say
this much in reply to the remarkable state-
ments of the gentleman from Kentucky. Be-
yond this I need not go at present. The ad-
vancement already made by this Administra-
tion in the work of retrenchment proves most
conclusively that the President is prompt to
redeem his pledges made in behalf of econ-
omy ; and I predict with confidence that the
work already commenced, in which the people
have so deep an interest, will be continued
during his Administration.
Mr. DAWES. I yield five minutes to my col-
league on the committee, the gentleman from
Kentucky, [Mr. Beck.]
Mr. BECK. Mr. Speaker, I simply rise to
reply to the statement of my colleague on the
comm'ittee, from Michigan, [Mr. Beaman,]
who, when he comes to review what he has
said, will find not only that he has misappre-
hended what I have stated, but that ho has
failed to comprehend the facta in the case.
The gentleman's whole assumption of dimin-
ished expenditure, as 1 understand it, is based
upon the idea that I said there was only
$213,000,000 appropriated during the current
year ; and from that ho has apparently gone
into an elaborate argument to show that I iiave
overstated the facts in regard to the expend-
itures, when I said they would be nearer
$400,000,000 than $314,000,000. That is far
from being my statement and is far from being
the fact. I stated that there was $102,000,000
of unexpended balances in the hands of cer-
tain Departments of the Government; and for
the same Departments to which these balances
apply there was appropriated for the current
fiscal year $111,000,000, and when you took
from the $102,000,000 all that the Secretary
said could be carried forward to the next
hscalyear, and all thalcouldbe carried forward
into the surplus fund, there would still bo left
$94,000,000 to be added to the $111,000,000 to
be appropriated to_ these Departments, making
$200,000,000 for those Departments alone. I
showed him, in connection with that, that in
the regular appropriation tjill we had appro-
priated $281,000,000, leaving out fractions, in
addition to all the balances on hand for the
current fiscal year, of which that $111,000,000
was a part, and to which this $94,000,000 must
be added, together with the moneys we may
have since appropriated for other purposes,
and all that is embraced in the present defi-
ciency bill, running it to between three hundred
and eighty and four hundred million dollars;
and the gentleman cannot escape from that.
And it is simply by failing to apprehend
that that $94,000,000 had to be added to the
$281,000,000, and by addingit to the $111,000,-
000 merely, that he has been able to make
something like a show of apparent economy,
when the fact does not exist, and I have never
stated it in any other form than as I now do.
And if the gentleman will look at the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury he will see
that the Secretary does not state it otherwise
than as I do. When he tries to get away from
the fact that the Secretary does so state it, as
already explained, he fails to read the plain
language, which is as follows: "estimated
amount which will be expended during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1870," for these
Departments, "$206,000,000;" of which
$111,733,906 76 was embraced in the regular
appropriations, and the other $94,367,000 was
in the Treasury, subject to the order of the
Departments, when the current fiscal year
began.
The truth is that gentlemen are playing fast
and loose all round about this question. The
Speaker and the chairman of the Committee
on Appropriations announced, as I heretofore
showed, that during the last year of Andrew
Johnson's administration $368,000,000 had
been expended, with a debt of $8,000,000 con-
tracted besides. The chairman of the Com-
mittee on Banking and Currency, the gentle-
man from Ohio, [Mr. Garfield,] announced
in his speech Monday that during the last
year of Andrew Johnson's administration year
they had only expended $321,000,000, being
forty or fifty millions less than the Speaker
and the chairman of the Committee on Appro-
priationssay; andhefftmounces asa fact which
he says cannot be controverted that during the
current fiscal year the expenditures will be re-
duced down to $292,000,000, when the Secre-
tary asserts and shows that when you add the
unexpended balances, which he says will all
be expended, it is nearly one hundred million
dollars more than he says.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I quoted it
from the Secretary's report. That is all.
Mr. BECK. This is exactly what you said:
" The year ending June 30,1869, which embraeed
only about four months of General Grant's admin-
istration, showed expenditures of $321,000,000—afalt-
ing off of $56,p00,000. And tho year which will close
on thcSOth oi June next, by the official estimates of
tho Secretary of the Treasury, will bring the expend-
itures down to §292,000.000, a further reduction of
nearly thirty million dollars from tho expenditures
of last year.''
Now, sir, if the gentleman from Ohio is cor-
rect the Secretary is reporting one thing one
day and another thing another day. Nothing
could excuse what would seem to be the total
ignorance of the distinguished gentleman from
Ohio, oxccpt that ha now says he was misled
by the statement of the Secretary.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I did not say
1 was misled. I say I quoted the report of
the Secretary.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. I yield for three minutes to
the gentleman from Wisconsin, [Mr. Wash-
burn.]
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I under-
stand the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr.
Beck] to say that there was on hand at the
commencement of this year $102,000,000.
Mr. BECK. I say the Secretary so reported.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. And that
we appropriated for the eurrcnt expenses of
this year $181,000,000.
Mr. BECK. Two hundred and eighty-one
million dollars.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I should
have said $281,000,000, thus making an aggre-
gate of $383,000,000.
Mr. BECK. Yes.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. That
amount, then, I understand him to say was at
the disposal of the Government for this year,
and that it seems by the report of the Secretary
of the Treasury it will 8,1 1 be expended during
the year, and no balances will be carried to
the surplus fund.
Mr. BECK. Or to the next fiscal year.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. Or to the
next fiscal year. And the gentleman there-
fore says that the expenditures for this year
will amount to $383,000,000. Now, I appre-
hend that the error my friend from Kentucky
has fallen into is in supposing that we can run
this Government up to the 1st of July and
exhaust all the appropriations at that time, and
that none will then remain unexpended. The
gentleman cannot fail to know that the Gov-
ernment cannot work smoothly with hal
ances much less than $100,000,000 constantly
on hand, or something approaching very nearly
to that. It is scattered all over the country in
the hands of disbursing officers, and the report
from which quotations are made simply means
that the appropriations for next year cannot be
relieved by balances that will remain on hand
at the close of this year, as a similar balance
must be on hand at the end of every fiscal
year; and it is just morally impossible, as the
gentleman must know, to run the Government
and exhaust all the appropriations on the 1st
of July. How much actual balance there may
be on hand on July 1, 1870, is a mere matter
of conjecture, but I fancy that the balance
actually on hand at that time will not vary very
much from what it wajs on the 1st of last July.
Mr. BECK. It is made the duty of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury by law to tell us exactly
what is on hand at the end of each fiscal year,
and at no other period of the year can these
facts be arrived at at all. He is obliged to tell
us not only what is on hand, but what will be
expended artd what will go to the next fiscal
year and to the surplus fund ; and when the
Speaker and the chairman of the committee
attempt to give the expenditures from the 4th
of March to the 4th of March in any year they
attempt what is impossible.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. I now call for a vote on the
amendments and bill.
The SPEAKER. Unless a separate vote is
desired on any amendment the question will
be taken on agreeing to all the amendments
reported by the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union.
Mr. CREBS. I ask a separate vote on the
amendment offered by myself in relation to the
custom-house at Cairo, Illinois.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands
that the amendment was not agreed to in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
and it is not therefore before the House.
Mr. CREBS. I ask the consent of the chair-
man of the Committee on Appropriations to
have a separate vote on that amendment.
The SPEAKER. The chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations could not give
such consent, as the previous question is oper-
ating. It would require unanimous consent.
The amendments of the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union were then
agreed to.
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time; and being engrossed,
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr._DA.WES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
