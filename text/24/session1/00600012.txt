THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

On that arc already imposed by Conjrets the
following charsres, by current and permanent ap-
propriation*, which have not yet been expended.

seen 'n ili.-eitimat «.land the balance of 5,475,320,
which rus no' been required,e-ther at all, or sm-
sonahly, for the ob]ects contemplated in its ap-
propriation, will, thertibre, be carried to the .sur-
plus fund. Secondly, on what is properly em-
braced in the appropriations towards the sinking
fund, there is an outstanding charge of about
$053 556, for unclaimed laten ¡ t and uiv idends on
the funded d> bt, and of $37,333 for unfunded
debt.
These, though chargeable on the Treasury, un-
der existing act* of Congress, and subject at any
moment to be demanded, are not all likely to
be called for immediately, if ever.
Computing, however, all the existing charges
of every kind on the Treasury at the end of the
present year to be about $7,55)5,574, the balance
of available funds then on hand would, it is esti-
mated, be sufficient to meet the whole at once, and
leave, to be hereafter applied by Congress to new
and other purpose , the sum of about $10,450,024.
The next subject deserving consideration is
the action of this Department since the last re-
port in relation to the final extinguishment of the

Before the close of the yesr 1834, ample funds
were deposited with the United States Bank, as
Commissioner of Loans, to discharge  all  the
public funded debt which was then outstanding.

Previoi s appropriations to be used for 1836,
for civil, ¿Le., ¿5,192; for military,&c, $339,515.
By v irtue of former acts of Congress there will
probably be wanted, during-1836, for the payment
pf intr rest and dividends unclaimed on the funded
1 debt, and of unfunded debt itself, yet unpaid, the
sum of $50,000.
To these add such contingent excesses of new
appropriations by Congress for ordinary pitr-
po^s as are not included in the estimates, but
which are likely to be deemed proper by that
body, and the giounds of which were explained
in the last annual report, $3,000,000. The esti-
mate"! of expenditures in lKjb", for extraordinary
purposes, which are submitted in connection with
the military and the naval services, amount to
$3,326.825. Making, as estimated for the service
of 1836, all the new appropriations of every kind,
specifically called for, to be $17,515,933; and all
the expenditures of every kind, for the service of
the same year, to be in the aggregate $23,133,640.
On the supposition that the appropriations out-
standing and unexpended at the ends of the years
1835 and 1836 will be similar in amount, this
would leave an available balance in the Treasury
at the close of the year 1836, or on the 1st of
January, 1837, estimated at about $14,500,000,
provided the receipts be as computed, and Con-
gress make no larger appropriations for extraor-
dinary or other purposes at their present session
than those enumerated in the estimates submitted.
From this amount, after deducting about eight
millions to pay the outstanding appropriations,
to which the Treasury will then probably stand
pledged, there will be left, at the elo«°e of 1836, a
net balance of only from six to seven millions
applicable to any other use, w Inch Congress may
now, or then, be pleased to designate, instead of
about ten and a half millions, the net balance
estimated to be left so applicable at the close of
1835. In other words, the expenditures will in
the ensuing year, for only the objects specified in
the estimate', probably exceed the receipts in that
year about four millions of dollars, and thus to
that extent reduce the balance now on hand.
IV.—Explanations of Estimate f«r 1836, with some
suggestions on the probable changes till 1842.
The basis on which the above estimates rest
will now be exhibited and explained.
In the peculiar condition of the country at this
time, without any deht to absorb our surplus
receipts, and amidst the great changes which
have recently happened, and will probably con-
tinue to happen, in our whole rev enue and expend-
itures, till after the essential alterations made by
existing lav. s shall cease in 1842, this Department
feels bound to enter more into detail than usual
concerning the grounds oí its estimates, and to
disclose mote fully every material consideration .
which nas li ditto the results presented. Congress
will thus be better enablfd to judge of their aecu- <
racy and to cornet any unintentional errors. For
convenience in reference, a tabular statement is
annexed (A.) which piesents separately for 1833,
1834, and 1835, so far as the List is ascertained,
the general estimates in one coraran, the actual
appropriations in another, and the expenditures
m a third. To these are added, in oth< r columns,
the vv hoi  n venue, with the exports and imports
fur tach of those years. For a similar reason the
Register has been requested to have the detailed
estimates for 1836 prepared with a second column,
showing against each the actual appropriation irt
1835 towards a like object.
Explanation of tlie Estimates of Receipts from
Custotas.
In respect to the estimated receipts in the
Treasury for 183G, sofar as derived from customs,
they have been computed on an importation of
foreign merchandise, expected to be near the
average of the last three years, but much less
than the importation of the yeai ending Septem-
ber, i83á.                                y                      v
Undei our present system of revenue, derived
usually in the ratio of three fourths to six sevenths
from customs, the amount of lthports have a very
important bearing on our whole receipts. The
amount of exports is likewise material, a  in some
degree influencing the imports, and in the present
condition of the country throwing much light on
its great agricultural prospf rity, and furnishing,
with the others, highly useful indications concern-
ing the extent and increase of our foreign com-
merce.
The imports dur.ng the year ending Septem-
ber 30, 1835, are ascertained and estimated at
|151,030,368.
They show, compared with the preceding year,
an increase of $24,509,036. Those during the
three past years have on an average been about
$128,556,670.
The exports during the past year are ascer-
tained and estimated at fl 18,955,239; of these
|98,531,026 were in domestic, and $20,424,213
in foreign products. Compared with the preced-
ing year they exhibit án increase of $14,618,266.
As some evidence that our estimates of the
whole importations the ensuing year are founded
on correct data, it appears from a document an-
nexed, (C,) giving the amount from 1790, that
they have constantly and sometimes largely fluc-
tuated between particular years, though, compar-
ing most terms of a few consecutive years with
former ones, they have generally increased. Thus
the whole imports during the five years prior to
1835 exceeded those of any former period of
similar length by nearly fifty millions, except on
one occasion, almost thirty years since, when
they approached near, and another, about twenty
years since, when they exceeded, their recent
amount; in consequence, at the former period, of
our extraordinary share in the carrying trade, arid
at the latter one, of the large demands to supply
the deprivations which had been caused by war,
and to meet the increased calls of numerous new
commercial enterprises, fostered by returning
peace. But the very fact of our recent importa-
tions having been so large, is one of the causes
why a considerable diminution in the whole
amount in 1836 is anticipated. Some further
causes will hereafter be specified, in connection
with other considerations, which, it is believed,
will tend to produce the same conviction. When
we proceed to examine the free or dutiable char-
acter, rather than the amount of our imports
during only e few years past, with a view to esti-
mate more critically the revenue which will prob-
ably be received from them in 1836, and to form
some general conjectures upon the subject thence,
forward to 1842, it is a fact, deserving careful
notice, that while the whole amount of imports
has for some years been increasing, that portion
paying duties has greatly diminished, and at the
same time the portion exported and entitled to
drawback has not diminished in a similar ratio.
A statement is subjoined, which furnishes im-
I portant details on this point since the late great
' changes in the tariff, (B.)
The general results from them are, that while
the importation  paying duties have fallen ofT in
1833 about eleven millions, and in 1834 about
seventeen millions more, and the free goods
increased wi even larger proportions, the expor-
tation of dutiable articles has fallen off" in the cor-
responding years only about six and two millions,
leaving the  actual  consumption  in the United
i States of such foreign merchandise as pays duties
at little more than one third of our whole imports,
and quite twenty millions less than in 1832. This
computation as to the consumption is made on
the probable hypothesis that the stock of such
merchandise on hand remained about the same
at the close of each year, which, though not cor-
rect in some single years, on account of war and
various vibrations in trade, would, in any series
of a few years, be near the trXith     The importa-
l tions, howevei, in 1835, and especially in the last
quarter, as they have been Unpreeedentedly large,
exceeding, it is computed, in that alone, more
than fifty-three millions, and mostly not yet con-
sumed, may be thought to constitute some excep-
tion to the above rule; and hence, coupled with
the fact that the returns are still incomplete, and
depend, in part, on estimates, their amount and
character have not been introduced into this
comparison. But they are inserted in the table
as far as ascertainable, and if considered without
any unusual limitations or deductions, would
show a great fluctuation in the consumption, both
I of all foreign merchandise and of that which is
1 not free.
[ The rate of duty has in many articles been so
essentially reduced or entirely removed, as to
lessen the whole receipts fiom customs over
twenty-four millions m the last two years, and
produce most of the above differences in the
character of our imports.    With a view to enable
