Simsport and will in all probability get away to-night. A regiment has been sent to the left bank of the De Glaize to annoy him between Simsport and Old River. I have had no report of their operations. The campaign may be considered as closed here, where it opened on the 12th of last March. It has been a most arduous one to me and to this army. The limits of human and equine endurance have been reached. If the water permits I will cross the Atchafalaya, bring up Walker's division and push for the La Fourche, and blockade the Mississippi River.

Your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA, Alexandria, May 23, 1864.

COLONEL: On the night of the 20th and 21th instant the enemy completed their crossing of the Atchafalaya, and the country south of Red River is now rid of his presence. All previous operations have been reported to you. The communication of the general commanding of the 17th instant reached me on yesterday on my arrival at this place.* I am suffering from sickness and exhaustion, and as soon as I am strong enough will reply thereto. My cavalry force is now crossing the Atchafalaya, and Walker's division is resting at this place. The usual refrain of want of clothing and shoes is being sung. I hope the Clothing Bureau will be able at once to put a stop to it. My batteries are rendered very inefficient for want of artillery horses. Unless the most stringent measures are adopted and their wants supplied, it will be impossible to act upon the defensive, much less upon the offensive. It is out of the question to fit our batteries with horses from the country overrun by the enemy, and I must rely upon the northern portion of the department, which has been protected from invasion, to furnish the army whit the necessary means to punish the enemy still further. During the last twelve months I have been constantly urging the necessity of furnishing artillery horses and the absolute need of supplying them. I cannot too urgently impress upon department headquarters the vital importance of immediate action which will supply my wants in this respect. I have not received a horse for my batteries from department headquarters since I have been in command of this district, notwithstanding my constant appeals and the urgent wants of my artillery.

Major-General Canby arrived in New Orleans on the 19th instant and relieved General Banks of the command of the Department of the Gulf.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

Colonel S. S. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
