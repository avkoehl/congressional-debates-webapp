General R. H. ANDERSON:

I have just received your note of 5 p. m. I am glad you have discovered the road intersecting that between Haw's Shop and Attle's. Place a picket on it to give you notice, as well as for your safety. If you find the enemy moving on it, strike at him. I have sent Breckinridge on thee direct road from Attle's to Haw's Shop. Do everything for the grand object, the destruction of the enemy.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.

[WILMINGTON, N. C.,] May 24, 1864.

Major MOORE,

Commanding, &c, Kenansville:

Reliable scouts report the enemy at Peletier's Mills, under Colonel Ripley, on a raid, said to be intended for Richlands. Communicate this to Captain Morris, at Richlands or elsewhere, and inform him that Captain Beazley marched from here yesterday morning by Holly Shelter road to join him. These two, judiciously managed, might turn the raid back.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
