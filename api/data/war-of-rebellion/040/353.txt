MAY 2, 1863-6.15 a.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy's troops opposite this place remain in the same position as yesterday. Owing to the high winds now prevailing, I am unable to use a glass sufficiently to see whether there is any move on the roads between here and the battle-ground of yesterday or not. I will examine them the first opportunity, and report.

Yours, &amp;c.,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts.

MAY 2, 1863-7.45 a.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

Heavy cannonading has just commenced in a westerly direction about 12 miles. The enemy are shelling our troops opposite here.

T. S. C. LOWE,

Aeronaut.

MAY 2, 1863-8.30 a.m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

I cannot say that the enemy have decreased, but they do not show themselves quite so much this morning, and I can see no reserve on the opposite heights.

T. S. C. LOWE,

Aeronaut.
