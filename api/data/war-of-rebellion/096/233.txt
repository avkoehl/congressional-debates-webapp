three boats-two iron-clads and one wooden boat-as having passed the upper end of the canal, and that the wooden boat was coming back. I have telegraphed General Ferrero to know what evidence he has of the passage of the obstructions, and sent an officer, with some orderlies, to Varina to report the facts.

The signal officer at Crow's Nest reports that the enemy's gun-boats have not yet passed the obstructions. They are at Sleepy Hollow.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

City Point:

I shall know shortly from the commander of the Onondaga if the enemy's boats yet reached the obstructions. They mary be waiting for daylight to pass them. I have sent for two tugs from Bermuda Hundred to bring vessels up to the draw in the bridge at Varina, with a view of sinking them there if it becomes necessary, but I will not sink them unless it becomes the only way to stop the gun-boats.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

City Point:

General Grant's dispatch of 4.35 received. An intelligent officer should be sent up with the barges, so as to exercise good judgment about where to sink them in case of necessity. I think the best place is the draw in the bridge at Varina; next to that, Deep Bottom.

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
