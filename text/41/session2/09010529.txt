Total, ten districts .161,246
In these districts we have an aggregate vote
only of 161,246, which gives only 16,124 votes
to each district as against 38,347 in each of
the ton western districts to which I have called
attention. Is this the kind of equality of polit-
ical power in this Government which gentle-
men of the eastern States desire to accord to
us of the West ? Is this the kind of entertain-
ment to which we are to be invited for the next
three years on the floor of this House in this
Government of law, of equal rights, and of
exact justice ? Is this the policy you propose
to pursue under your amended Constitution?
Is this the measure of right you have to offer
to those who carry the banners^ of our civiliza-
tion and fight on the skirmish line? Is this the
encouragement you give to those who come to
us from other lands; those in our mountain
regions of mineral wealth; those on our great
rich prairies who are the real architects of our
vast material power, and to those who float the
commerce of our great rivers and lakes and
bring to your markets the products of our
mines, our forests, and our soil? Is this the
spirit that should be shown to States and peo-
ples who belong to a common Union,who fight
under a. common flag, and contribute to a com-
mon welfare? Is this the highest exhibition of
republican equality that can be given to the
people whose servants we are,whose rights we
should respect, and whose mandates we should
obey?
But this is not all. If these ten^ large dis-
tricts had an equal representation with the ten
small districts, on the basis of one for every
16,124 votes, they would now have twenty-three
members in this House to plead for the modi-
fication of the tariff on the common articles of
life, to vote for the reduction of internal taxa-
tion, to break up the monopoly of banking
privileges at the East, to demand for the new
sections of the country a fair share of the ap-
propriations for public improvements, and to
protest by voice and vote against every species
of class legislation. And, sir, what is true of
these ten districts is still better illustrated by
the condition of my own State, which is the
largest single district represented here, and by
the west district of Rhode Island. The vote
of Kansas at the last election was 45,000, while
the vote of the west Rhode Island district was
only 6,775. On this basis Kansas would be
entitled to seven members in_ this Congress
were she awarded the same privileges here now
enjoyed by the State of Khode Island. With
these glaring facts before us I can understand
the policy but not the justice of resisting a
reapportionment of the country at this time-
Take another view of this question. In the
districts represented by the gentleman from
Rhode Island, [Mr. Dixon,] the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butleb,] and the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. IjL'ffin-
ton,] there were cast at the last election only
42,314 votes; while Kansas, with its one Rep-
resentative, cast an excess of nearly 3,000 votes
over the entire vote of the three districts I have
named. But even the comparisons I have
made do not do full justice to Kansas. In that
State we have a Democratic party hopelessly
in the minority, and which, since its achieve-
ments in forming the Tjecompton constitution
and in exemplifying the traditional policy of
that party in the art of voting at Oxford and
Kickapoo, has given but a few feeble signs of

enterprise or life. The consequence is that not
more than three quarters of the legal voters
went to the polls, while the unprecedented large
immigration of the spring and summer was
excluded by the provision of the State consti-
tution which requires six months' residence to
constitute a voter. It cannot be doubted, there-
fore, that there were at least sixty thousand
men in the State who were of the proper age
to vote at that time. Since then the increase
of population has been enormous, and I will
not undertake to estimate the vote that would
be cast now with a contest between the Wo
political parties for the supremacy.
If we compare the vote for President by
States we shall find that the same inequalities
exist as between congressional districts. The
States of Kansas, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota,
Illinois, and California voted in the aggregate
for President 1,002,726 votes, and are repre-
sented by twenty-nine members of Congress.
The States of New York and Massachusetts
voted atthe same election only 1,045,677 votes,
and are represented by forty-one members of
Congress. Illinois, with a vote of440,436, has
only eleven members ; and Massachusetts, with
a vote of 195,911, has ten. The six New Eng-
land States, with Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
and West Virginia added, voted 1,411,514
votes, having fifty-nine members here ; but the
1,406,258 voters in California, Kansas, Wis-
consin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana
have but forty members, though of equal pop-
ulation and of more than equal producing j
agricultural capacity and other resources. 1 ;

Mr. Speaker, having shown the. pressing
necessity, based upon the most apparent facts,
of making a reapportionment for the election
of the Forty-Second Congress, I now desire to
say that I am in favor of increasing the number
of the members of this House for the next Con-
gress to three hundred at least. Indeed, I
would make the number still larger if it were
in my power to do so, and for reasons which it
seems to me are worthy of consideration in the
decision of this important question. The ag-
gregate population by decades, upon which our
representation has been based from 1790 up to
1860, is shown as follows:
1790   3,929,8g
1800   5,305,937
iaO   ...  7,23^814
IgV... :  9,63^191
1830   12,866,020
lm'z:::::::: 17,069,453
1850   23,191,876
I860;;...;":  31,445,080
The number of our population in 1870, as
estimated by the best authorities, will amount
to over forty millions.
I now give by decades the numerical basis
for a single Representative since 1790, and flie
whole number, as follows:
Sate of appor- Whole number of Ratio for a single
iionment. Representatives. Representative.
1792 105 33,000
1802 141 33,000 •
1811 181 35,000
1822  212 40,000
1832  240 47,700
1842 223 70,680
1850 234 93,340
1860 241 126,823
By this it will be seen that the basis of rep-
resentation has increased from 83,000 in 1792,
when the first enumeration was had, to 126,823
under the enumeration of 1860; and that the
number of members of this House has increased
during the same period from 105 to 241. In
order to show this progress of our represent-
ative system in detail I have carefully prepared
the following table, exhibiting the number of
members from each State as authorized by
the various acts of Congress passed within the
period of each decade:
