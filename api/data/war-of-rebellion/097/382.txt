*So recorded in Meade's letter-book and so dated in the original draft. But in the latter the date is in ink (while the dispatch is in pencil) and in a different hand from the next. It was probably written between 10.15 and 10.45 p.m. March 31, 1865. See Grant to Meade, 10.15 p.m., p. 342, and Meade to Grant, 10.45 p.m., p. 342.
