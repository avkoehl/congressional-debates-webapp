massacre yesterday, and they stated that Thrailkill left Singletone with the intention of crossing the river and joining Pap Price. They paroled the two bushwhackers, and the rebels at Florence buried them.

FRANK D. EVANS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GLASGOW, September 30, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,

In the Field, Sturgeon:

Move your command to Rocheport regardless of any small bands of bushwhackers, and send 100 men toward Glasgow by forced marches. Wait my arrival at Rocheport unless you receive other orders.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SURGEON, September 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK, Glasgow:

My scouts just in and report guerrillas numerous south and southeast of this place. I think they are concentrating to cross the river at Portland. Have you any news from the Mount Zion fight?

T. J. STAUBER.

GLASGOW, September 30, 1864.

Colonel STAUBER, Sturgeon:

I have heard of no fight at Mount Zion Church. When was it, who fought, and what results?

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 30, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Colonel DYER, Warrenton, Mo.:

SIR: I am pained to learn that the guards sent on the railroad are in the habit of behaving in a most disorderly manner, firing from the cars at animals and persons. Such behavior is worse than savage. You will promulgate this, and hereafter have any man shot who is guilty of firing at persons-not armed enemies-from the cars, and arrest and send here to prison any one who fires from the cars without orders, except at the enemy. Officers having charge of the guards will be held responsible for the conduct of their men and the execution of this order.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

GLASGOW, September 30, 1864.

Colonel DYER, Mexico:

That is the talk; push is the word. Rocheport needs your spirit among them. Order every rebel in that region to haul his forage to you forthwith. Keep every man on the alert, and tell the boys to remember Centralia.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
