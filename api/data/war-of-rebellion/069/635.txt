Chief Quartermaster:

COLONEL: General Butler directs me to inquire whether the sawmills at Sewell's Point, Tanner's Creek, Warwick, Portsmouth, Newport News, and others, if any, are running. Also, whether you can supply lumber for the use of this army. If you cannot supply lumber, he desires to be informed of the reason.

June 5, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

My lookout reports seeing some light artillery, estimated as two batteries come to Chaffin's Bluff battery and pass down the river there. Some fires have appeared back of Chaffin's Bluff to-day like camp-fires. Some mounted officers appeared on the green on Farar's Island as if on a reconnaissance this p. m. After our firing some of the enemy's batteries opened on battery Numbers 3, and one gun from Dr. Howlett's of pretty large caliber. Captain Foster has gone to report to you.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

GILLMORE'S,

June 5, 1864-3.40 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have fired twelve times from Battery 3 at the point from which the enemy fired last. Caused no reply; only saw a few heads above their parapet.

GILLMORE,

General.
