24th Cóiíg....1st Sess.                Navy Appropriation Bill—Mr. Garland, of Virginia.
Hck of Reps.
who oppose the present incumbents are proprie-
tors of presses, and each had a distinct party
vote; and the only reason why neither -was
elected is, the party to which they were attached
was not strong enough. The party vote which
elected the present incumbents is cited as proof
of party organization; yet, sir, the direct party
vote to the other candidates is proof that there
was no party organization; a singular conclusion
certainly. íf the election proved party organiza-
tion, it proved it in relation to all parties.
I think, by recurring to the elections of public
printer, it will be found, from the foundation of
the Government, that the conductor of a public
journal has been selected; and since parties have
assumed a distinct character, the editor elected
has always been attached to the dominant party.
It is generally on© of the tests of the strength of
party; it is one of the iesults of our system of
Government, and cannot well be avoided; the
public printing is dpna at fixed rates, and may
from time to time be reduced. So much for what
has been cjiarged as the corrupt practices of the
Government; for it is all based upon the fact, that
papers sustaining the Administration have been
employed to do the public printing. I would
gladly aid in restricting any improper interfer-
ence, by presses doing the public work, with elec-
tions, if it could be done consistent with the high
principles of liberty involved in the freedom of
the press. But, sir, I cannot consent to disfran-
chise the whole class of editors, becauseyin com-
mon with their fellow-citizens, they use the free-
dom of the press and of speech; it would not be
just; it would be incompatible with every princi-
fle of liberty and our free institutions. I confess
do not see very-clearly how it could be done;
but if the public service could be disconnected
with the public press, I .would aid all in my
power to accomplish it; "but k seems very imprac-
ticable, however plausible in theory.
I win now consider the charge of neglect' in the
Executive Department, in providing for the de-
fenses of the country. In making this charge,
the honorable gentleman from Tennessee has
called to the attention (of the committee) the de-
plorable state of the defenses of the country, and
almost entire destitution of arms and munitions
of war, and charges this state of things upon the
War Department.
Mr. BELL said, he made no attacks, nor in-
tended to make none, upon the War Department
in particular. My attack was upon the party—
upon those who were responsible for the action
of the Government in both the executive and
legislative departments.
Mr. GARLAND. I was aware that the hon-
orable gentleman did not exclusively implicate
the War Department; yet, sir i he charged upon
that Department great neglect.. It is my purpose
now to vindicate the Department itself. I will
«ay something hereafter as to the majority.
There presides over that Department? Mr. Chair-
man, a man whose genius, enterprise, energy,
and activity, are not surpassed by any of his pre-
decessors. Order, skill, energy, integrity, and
activity prevail in the administration of that
Department in all its ramifications, and 1 assert,
without the fear of'successful contradiction, that
all the means which have been placed in its power
have been promptly and judiciously employed in
placing the defenses of the country in an imposing
and safe condition. Beyond the mean  afforded
by Congress, that Department could not go. • It
is known that rwarly all the fortifications con-
structed during the late war, owing to the haste
with which they .were constructed, and the bad
materials employed, are, and have been for years,
in a state of rapid) deeay; yet, sir, what are. the
means which have been appropriated for their
repair? The annexed table will show:
Statement of the estimates for repairs and contin-
gencies of fortifications, and the amounts appro-
priated for the same object from the year 1821 to
1835 inclusive.

These sums are totally inadequate; yet it will
be perceived, that the last year, J834, and several
preceding, only $10,000 were appropriated to this
object; tliat for four successive years, commencing
with 1830, the Department asked «15,000, and
■Congress appropriated ál0,000 only,   In 1835,
nothing was appropriated. _ This accounts for the
state of dilapidation in which many of our forti-
fications are found.
In the  annual  report from the. Secretary of
Wpr, of November 30, 1829, the necessity of
hastening the preparations for the armament of
the fortifications was stated, and additional ap-
' propriations were asked therefor........,.'
Ektract from the Annuai Report of. the .5'PCfPÍS if War,
__                 dated 30th November, 1829.
l"A reference to the report of the chief of the ordnance
wilt show the particular details of the operation in tliat
branch of .the service; it merits attention.   It has .been
' frequently observed that the- best way to «void war as to
be in preparation,   tn this point of view it is desirable that
. the appropriations to be made for clothing our fortifications
" should correspond with the probable periods of'their com-
pletion.   It would, indeed, be a mortifying result, if, after
the labor and coet which have been encountered for their
. completion, it should rest in the power of an enemy, at the
. onset of war, to seize and destroy them, because the means
' bad not been placed in readiness for their defense.
fc    " From the report it will be perceived than at the present
i annual rate of appropriation, to wit, $100,000, sixteen or
■ twenty years will have- passed before a proper supply of
arms fqr those fortifications now in progresacan.be obtained
for thoir defense.   As regards this subject,.the course.most
■advisable to b£ pursued' would be, that the armament prep-
aration should progress corrcspondently with the works
themselves; not tbatthey should be mourned, and, by ex-
posure w the weather, become.decayed and useless, but
that the guns being at their positions, and the carriage? in
readiness, on the apprehension of war, suitable preparations
for resistance might at all defensible points appear, meeting
the objects for which, those fortifications were designed,
and yielding protection to the assailable parts of the union.
If, in the slow and gradual preparation for a necessary and
adequate armament at present pursued, sixteen years shall
be found requisite, and war within that period take place,
a consequence would be that some of our forts, built up at
great expense, would be destroyed, because incapable of
self-defense; or else, by being retained and armed, be used
by the enemy as annoyance and injury to ourselves. A meas-
ure involving snch important considerations should not be
protracted iu its execution; it carries with it, in foreboding
anticipation, too much of probable evil consequence. This
subject derives additional interest from the consideration
that guns and carriages require time, in preparation; they
are things that cannot be hastily arranged, and Which, to
defer, might prove prejudicial.     >    - -
" At the different arsenals and magazines an abundant
supply bf powder is in store. Considering its liability to in-
jury, rather than keep up the supply, it would bo preferable
to procure the materials of which it is composed, ready to
be manufactured, when circumstances shall makeitneces-
sary. These articles are now remarkably cheap, and are
easily preserved from deterioration. ReeoHeetiOn retains
the fact, that during the last war, the average price of salt-
peter was about forty cents, and bnmstone eight. Involved
in another contest, the same state of things might be pre-
sented, while at present those articles can be procured at
one eighth the price which, of necessity, had then to be
given.
" Being susceptible of ready preservation, it would prove
a matter of economy to forbear any future purchase ofpow-
der, contenting ourselves merely with obtaining an ade-
quate supply of ingredients, whenever it could be procured
at fair prices. The materials thus preserved and in readi-
ness, could, at short notice, be manufactured, whenever oc-
casion should make it necessary."
In the annual report from the Secretary of War,
of December 1, 1830, the subject was. again re-
newed, and the propriety of an additional appro-
priation again pressed.
Extract from the annual Report of the Secretary of War,
of tk* 1st December, 1830.
" The Ordnance Department is progressing as rapidly as
the means afforded will permit, in arming the rnihtia of the
States, and in preparing the necessary guns and carriages
for garnishing the different fortresses of the country. It is
worthy of consideration whether the appropriation appli-
cable to this service should not be increased, so as to pro-
vide a suitable armament by the time the different fortifi-
cations along the coast shall be completed. For the forts
which are finished, $1,000,000 will be necessary; but, be-
sides these, others arc in progress, and will shortly be
completed. With the annuai appropriation of $100,800
towards this purpose, it will require ten years to accom-
plish the object for those which are in readiness. Should
we be blessed with peace, no injury will arise; but should
war take place, the effects upon our country would be of
a serious and prejudicial character."
In the annual report from the Secretary of
War, of November 21, 1831  this subject was
again brought before Congress, and all the neces-
sary details connected with the supply of cannon
on hand, and of the number wanted, were given,
and the propriety of establishing a national
foundery ,■ witha view ef providing the necessary
armament,- was suggested and recommended.
Extract from theJhtnvai Report of the Secretary of War,
■ ■■ thteé November 21,1631.
"There are now 623 cannon of various calibers for field
service. And there are at the arsenals and in the old forti-
fications, 1,165. But these cannon are all of antiquated
patterns, and, with- the exception bf the- six' pounders,
amounnng to 344, and a few of the heavier pieces, are con-
sidered unserviceable. There have been procured for the
armament of the new fortifications. 1,214 cannon of the
improved pattern.     ■• •               •■     r

•* It fs estimated that an iron'cannon will not safely bear
wore than l;20b discharges with the service charge, after
' which it should be broken up.
.    " The United States have no armories for the fabrication
, of cannon. The practice for some years has beep to make
contracts with the owners Of the four founderies atltieh-
tnond, fieoreetown, Pittsburg, and West Point, to the
l amount of the annual appropriatrotr, allowing about an
equal proportion to each, and paying lUuti price as the
Ordnance Department, on the «est information, judge rea-
' sonable.                        ,        '
" This procedure has been'' repeatedly stated i  the nn-
' nual reports td Congress, together with toe seasons which
. led to it. These are founded in the capital and experience
required to conduct this business; in the necessity of de-
pending, in some degree, upon the integrity and character
of the manufacturers, as there may be defects'in Ore piece
not easily discoverable, owing to the necessity of muting
together iron of diffomt qualifies i audio' the bflief, tliat
if a general competition for these supplies were e*cited,
the existing establishments would be broken down, and
others endeavor to take their places, which wottM either
tail from similar causes, or furnish icaaaon unfit for. Bar-
vice, and thns leave the Government, at some critical pe-
riod, without the means of procuring this indispensable
arm of defense. The provisions of the act of Congress of
March 3,1809, seem, however, to present serious objec-
tions to this course; and I bring the subject before you, at
this time, that it may be fully considered.
" It appears to me that a public armory for the fabrica-
tion of cannon is required by obvious considerations. By
forming snch an establishment, the necessary experience
and artisans would be provided, and suohsupplies of heavy
ordnance manufactured as the Government might direct.
The actual value of the article would be ascertained, and
contracts with individuals' could bfe formed, with a full
knowledge Of the circumstances. There would be no
danger of combinations, nor would any injury result from
lair competition. The supplies might be so controlled as
to leave no fear of a deficiency in the quality or quantity
of this essential arm of defense."
.     In each of these years .the sum of $100,000, in
. addition to the usual approprit lion of #100,000,
was asked for the armament of fortifications, and
not granted by Congress.
The sum actually appropriated fot ihe¡ arma-
ment of fortifications, which   object, includes
cannon, carriages, &c, for each year since 1839,
inclusive, is *100,000, making for the years 1829
to 1835, the sum of #700,000.
There have been.procured With this «urn—
i   a 4£-pounder cannon..   ,     .,
1,052 32-pounder   do.

There was on hand, on the 4th of March, 1829,

which were serviceable.
There have been since added, as is shown
