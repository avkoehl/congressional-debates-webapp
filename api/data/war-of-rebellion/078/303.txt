EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, August 26, 1864 - 9. 31 a. m.

Governor JohnSON,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Thanks to General Gillem for making the news, and also to you for sending it. Does Joe Heiskell's "walking to meet us" mean any more than that Joe was scared and wanted to save his skin?

Major-General BURBRIDGE:

I have heard nothing from Wheeler since last night. He was then at Strawberry Plains, eighteen miles from Knoxville. The line is down between here and Knoxville. A part of Morgan's command is at Jonesville, Va. Some of his men were captured at Rogersville Monday night.

W. Y. DILLARD,

Colonel, Commanding.

CUMBERLAND GAP, August 26, 1864 - 6. 40 p. m.

[Major-General BURBRIDGE:]

A detachment of General Gillem's cavalry have arrived here with Wheeler's inspector-general and another prisoner. I learn from them that Wheeler has nine brigades and two batteries. his destination is evidently Kentucky. He will either go through Big Creek Gap or attempted to force his away through Cumberland Gap. I expect Gillem's command will reach here to-morrow from Greenville.

W. Y. DILLARD,

Colonel.
