The SPEAKER, by special order of the
House, the Committee of Claims is entitled to
the floor.
southern claims.
Mr. BLAIR, of Michigan, from the Com-
mittee of Claims, reported back with amend-
ments, and with the recommendation that it do
pass, the bill (H. R. No. 3583) making appro-
priations for the payment of claims reported
allowed by the commissioners of claims, under
the act of Congress of March 3, 1871.
Mr. BLAIR, of Michigan. I will ask that
the reading of the bill be dispensed with, as it
is a simple statement of the amount due to
various persons.
There being no objection, the reading of the
bill was dispensed with; and tbe amendments
reported by the committee were agreed to.
The question was upon ordering the bill as
amended to be engrossed and read a third
time.
Mr. BLAIR, of Michigan. I will state sim-
ply that this bill contains the entire work of
the Southern claims commission. The total
number of claims reported by the commis-
sioners of claims in their last report is 2,209,
of which 1,061 have been allowed in whole or
in part, and 1,148 have been wholly rejected.
Since the report was transmitted to the
House of Representatives, eight cases reported
allowed in whole or in part have been returned
to tbe commissioners, at their request, for re-
examination.
Of the eases reported at the last session
some five, I think, were suspended on the sup-
position that some further evidence might be
obtained in regard to them which perhaps
might satisfy some scruples that the com-
mittee had in regard to them. We have be-
come satisfied, and they have been inserted
in this bill. The bill, therefore, contains pre-
cisely the work of the commission. We have
neither increased nor reduced any of these
amounts. A good many of the cases we have
examined at considerable length, thinking at
first that we ought to do so, but on a careful
examination we found that we could not im-
prove the work of the commission.
Some of the cases are peculiarly hard. I
recollect' a single case in which the property
taken and destroyed on the plantation of loyal
persons in Mississippi was worth $450,000,
and all the commission could allow was
$56,000. We looked into that case with a
very great desire to have done something bet-
ter if we could, but upon a full examination
we found that it would be impossible without
unsettling the rules on which all the examin-
ations have been made. The total'amount of all
the cases reported in the bill is $853,609 17.
I presume there will be no objection to the bill,
and I ask for a vote upon it.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time ; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr BLAIR, of Michigan, moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the bill was passed ;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table,
I he latter motion was agreed to.
