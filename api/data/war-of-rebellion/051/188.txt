After passing for some time through swarms of stragglers, wounded,a nd prisoners, we arrived on the line and were formed, facing our right flank, and moved forward to the attack,and proceeded some 200 yard, when the brigade was halted and ordered to lie down. In a few minutes we rose up and advanced to the front, and occupied some time in getting our position. It was now getting dark, but the firing was still heavy and constant between the enemy and some brigade oppo-
