Wisconsin Contested Election—Mr, Thomas.
Bo. os U$m-
fully competent to afford us sufficient information
to enable us to judge correctly and justly, on this
subject of repeal Why, then, pay f 50,000 to
printers for infoimation we do not need' It had
been hinted that the compromise act, so called,
with regard to the tariff, ought not now to be dis-
tuibed Hedidnotfeel that his hands were tied by
by that act, so as to prevent him doing justice now
No' "let justice be done, though the heavens
should fall "
Mr. M. begged of gentlemen to pause, and look
back at what they had done The amount paid '
for printing had been enormous The post office
reports—thirty thousand or more of that docu-
ment had been printed, at some forty or fifty
thousand dollars cost, with the view of enlighten-
ing the people as to the corruptions, as was saiJ,
in that department—what had this printing done'
Furnished a job foraprmtei,and the whole story
is told They were so distubuted, he had heard
of their being used as wadding for cannon fired to
celebrate Demociatic victories ' Bethought it an
effectual mode of distribution, and commended
the inventor for his wit, but, in his part of the
country, this document, with others, under which
the mail coaches literally groaned, fianked by
membeis of Congress, were dibtubuted in the
country stores, and used as wrapping paper for
tea and other articles sold in small quantities
Another charge for printing had been made some j
years ago of $20,000 or upwai ds, on a motion of |
a Senator from Alabama, to print the correspond |
ence and papers of the Indian Bureau A Seii-
tor near me says, name him, he said he had no '
objection—the Hon Mr Mooie He believed
that the Senator who made the motion did not,
nor had any other at the time, have an idea of the
extent and cost of this work, it consisted, he be-
lieved, of many volumes, he had seen a Senatoi
present his aims full of them to the Senate, and
assert that the expense was laiceny of the public
money, a fraud upon the Treasury, and he
thought the expression not too severe for the
occasion. Thus we had gone on printing and
distributing documents until the practice had
become a serious dram upon the Tieasury, and
almost a nuisance to the country, they were used
mostly, not for information, but as weapons of
political warfare by contending parties, and having
exhausted our own store, we are now to supply
the vacuum from a foreign country He hoped that
gentlemen, if they did not intend to pull down this
Administration, would not only make professions
of economy and retrenchment, but would actually
reduce it to practice, by beginning at home, here in
Congress, the very fountain head from whence all
these streams of wasteful extravagance flow He
had been reminded that the farmers of his own
neighborhood had suffered lo'js in the bale of their
poikonaocountofthescaicity and pi ice of salt the
past fall Headmittedhe hadundeistood that the
purchasers of poik weie somewhat checked, and
dealers in the article stood off for a while, under
apprehension that it would be difficult to obtain a
sufficient quantity of salt, but no one ever dieamed
that this state of things was produced by the duty
on imported salt No, sir, we had abundance of
salt in the country, and nothing but the lowness
of the waters m our nveis prevented a full supply
in the market. He said he would admit that pork
was at a lower price now than it had been the last
year, or was when the market first opened, but he
would inform the gentleman of the cause of this
change. It was not because we had notoidereda
sufficient number of documents to be punted at the
public expense; no such thing it was to the labor
of the gentleman here, and in which good work he
has afforded all the aid in his power, it was by
checking the banks in their wild career of specula-
tion,and bringing back the inflated currencyof the
country to something like a reality The value of
money had risen, because the article had appeared
something like it was of old, and genuine currency
had taken the place of a fictitious one, and what
the farmer could obtain for his pork now, had the
name at least of being substantial, not quite so
doubtful as formerly, which like Jonah's gourd,
was liable to wither and die in anight. Now, sir,
the firmer, with a good horse, common industry,
and the distance not too great, might hope to re-
ceive his pay by obtaining at the bank the money
for the paper he had íeceived for his pork.   He
had no doubt but the country was much benefited,
instead of being injured, by this change. He nad
conversed with sensible farmers and dealere, who
both concurred in opinion with him on this subject,
who weie ready to tender their thanks to the Sen-
ator from Missouri, for the noble stand he had made
in their favor, and he could assure the gentleman
that he most cordially tendered his, but he could
not join the gentleman now in printing documents
to raise the price of pork, because he did not see
any connection whatever between the tvvo objects,
and he remained still of opinion that the order for
printing ought to be rescinded
WISCO\SIN CONTESTED ELECTION
REMARKS OF HON. F. THOMAS,
OF MARYLAND,
In the House of Representatives,
January 3, 1839,
On the Wisconsin Contested Election.
The question was on the adoption of the follow-
ing resolution of the Committee of Elections-
" Resolved, That James Duane Doty is entitled
' to a seat in this House as a Delegate from Wis-
'consin Territory, and that George W. Jones is
' not bo entitled "
Mr THOMAS moved to amend the resolution
by transposing the names, so as to declare Mr
Jone3 entitled to the seat, and proceeded at length
to oppose the conclusions of the report
Mr T said that, as a member of the Judi
ciary Committee, he had been compelled at a
former session to examine veiy generally the laws
relating to the Territories Knowing this, the
sitting Delegate from Wisconsin had requested
him to piittcipate m this discussion I do so, sn,
foieseeing that the opinion I entertain will not
be banctioned by a vote of the majority of the
House The Committee of Elections, with great
unanimity, has reported in favor of the petitioner,
and against the sitting member, and there is, we
all know, a piedisposmon in many members to
acquiesce in the decision of a committee In this
case, too, we who oppose the report of the com-
mittee labor under another serious disadvantage
There is nothing to be gained by either political
party in the issue of this question And hence
a very strong inducement felt in most cases for
attending to a discussion "designed" to leveise
a repoit of a committee does not exist in this
instance Notwithstanding I have these reasons
to fear that my remarks will not be very patiently
listened to by the majority, and although I foresee
that defeat awaits us, I shall stand up for what I
think the right cause
The committee id this case have fu'ed to per-
form one of the most impoitant objects for which
this «object was referí ed They have not mfoi med
the House whether there has been heretofoie a
contest for a seat as a De'egate from a Terntoi y,
that we might pioht by the opinions of oui pie
decessors i propose to supply this omission I
will call the attention of the House to a contested
election which give rise to an act of Congress
applicable to the Territory of Wisconsin, and de-
signed, in my opinion, to guard against the occur
rence of a contest like this now under considera-
tion
On the 4th of June, 1813, an act of Congress
passed, authorizing the citizens of Missouri Ter-
ntory to elect one Delegate to the Congress of the
United States Nothing was said in the act as to
the time when the service of such Delegate should
commence oi terminate The power given to the
people of Missouri under this law was exercised,
and Rufus Easton, having been duly elected, took
his seat at the second session of the Thirteenth
Congiess, and continued to act as a Delegate
during that and the first session of the Touiteenth
Congress At the second session of the Fourteenth
Congress, John Scott appealed and claimed the
seat as a Delegate from Missouri, he having a cer-
tificate of election ftom the Governor of the Tet-
ntory. His right was contested by Mr Easton,
his competitor at the election, who maintained that
the election had been illegally conducted The
House, after a full examination of the whole mat-
ter, " Resolved, That the election m the Territory
' of Missouri has been ¡Ilegrlly conducted, and
' the «eat of the Delegate from that, TerrtíerTy ía
' vacant." No objection was urged on that occa-
sion to the right claimed by Mr Scott apon, the
Wiund now taken by the sitting Delegate from
isconsm. The law under which the Delegates
from Missouri had been elected, contained no pro-
vision like that in the law to which I shall pres-
ently refer. There was nothing to befoundsttfeat
time, either m the Constitution of the United States,
or the laws defining the term of a Delegatefioi  a
Territory. The Constitution had conferred upon
Congress the power to " make all needful rules
and regulations respecting the territory  r other
property belonging to the United States." And in
pursuance of this authority, Congress had estab-
lished a government for the Territory of Missouri,
and given to the citizens therein a right to elect a
Delegate, but Congress had not declared when the
time of service of such Delegate should either com-
mence or terminate. There was nothing in the law
or the Constitution authorizing a Delegate to sit
more than one year, or forbidding him to sit more
than two years, or five years, under one and the
same election Upon this point, the legislation
of Congress was manifestly defective. The eau-
test for a seat from Missouri directed attentionfH>
this imperfection, and a law was passed to gaajri
against the inconveniences and irregularities which,
without it would be unavoidable. I hold that act
now in my hand. I invite the attention of the
House to its provisions It is not referred to in
the leport of the Committee of Elections in thts
case, and may have escaped attention It was
approved by the President on the 3d of March,
1817, fifty days after the Missouri contest .had
been disposed of The first section, which ak>o*
i elates to the question now before the House, 4e-
clares "That in every Territory of the United
' States in which a temporary government has
' been, or hereaflei shall be, established, and which,
' by virtue of the ordinance of Congress of the
' thnteenth of July, one thousand seven hundred
' and eighty-seven, or of any subsequent act of Con-
' gress, passed or to be passed, now hath, or /teic-
' after shall have, the rightr to send a Delegate to
' Congiess, such Delegate shall be elected every
'second year, for the same term of two years, fin
' which members of the House of Representatives of
' the United States me elected." This language is
explicit, unequivocal. All delegates from the Ter-
ritories then existing, or to be established, are to
hold their seats for the same teim of two years for
which members of this House are elected. What
is that term' When does it commence' When
does it terminate' These questions*are settled be-
yond controveisy The term of a member of this
House commences on the 4th of March, and
teimmates on the 3J of Match two years next
succeeding Within those peuods, whenever the
Congress assembles of which an individual is a
duly elected member, he takes hisseatm the body
By the act of 1817, these privileges are extended
to the Delegates from all the Territories then exist-
ing, or to be established Ibey have a right to
sit in the Congress of which they are duly elected
members whenever it assembles between the 4th
of March, when its term commences, and the 3d
of that March, when its term ends
1 am awaie, sir, that there is another act of
Congress, concerning the Delegate from Wiscon-
sin, to be taken into consideiation But upon an
examination ofitsprovisions.it will be found that
they do not conflict with those of the act of 1817.
It still stands upon the statute-book unaltered, not
repealed by subsequent legislation, so far as Wis-
consin is concerned, and must be considered,as it
was obviously intended to be, as a fundamental
law for all the Territories That the House may
judge of the accuracy of this opinion, I will read
that part of the law to which I allude It is an act
passed on the 20uh of April, 1836, " establishing
the territorial government of Wisconsin " The
fourteenth section of the act alone relates to the
Delegate to this House, and decíales, "That a
* Delegate to the Hou«e of Representatives of the
' United States, 'o serve for the term of two years,
' may be elected by the \oters qualified to elect
' membeis of the Legislative Assembly, who "hall
' be entitled to the same rights and puvileges as
' have been granted to the Delegates from the sev-
' eial Territories of the United States to the said
' House of Representatives "
