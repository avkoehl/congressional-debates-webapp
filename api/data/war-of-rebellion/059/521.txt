Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The following dispatch is just received, and sent for the information of General Grant:

All my troops are now moving toward the objective point. In consequence of the detention down Red River of A. J. Smith, and the delay attending the collection of McPherson's furloughed regiments, I will be short three divisions of my right, in consequence of which I will not attempt to move on Johnson's rear at the start, but collect the entire army in front of Chattanooga, and make no detachments till the first issue at Dalton is determined. By May 5 all my infantry will be within one day's march of the enemy, but my cavalry, as usual, may be late, because of the difficulty of getting horses. I must imitate Forrest's example, and help myself. I began here yesterday, and at once have got here 1,000 good horses. I start for Chattanooga at noon to-day.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

NOTE.-The dispatch above spoken of did not accompany the message from General Sherman, which was not discovered until after he had left for Chattanooga.
