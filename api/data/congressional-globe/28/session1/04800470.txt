as it has over that with the Indian tribes; and in
that they have, at times, prohibited the sale of- dis-
tilled spirits.
' We have a good illustration of the power of Con-
gress over the subject-matter of trade or commerce
in relation to slaves. Immediately following the
enumeration of the powers of Congress, in the 8th
section, 1st article, of. the constitution, in the first
clause of the^9th section, it is provided that "the
migration or'importation of such persons as any of
the States now existing shall think proper to admit,
shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the
year 1808; but a tax or duty may be imposed on
such importations, not exceeding ten dollars for each
person." Now, this is no grant of power. It is a
limitation of power, restricting Congress from pro-
hibiting the importation of slaves before 1808, and
further restricting the duty to ten dollars each.
The slaveholding States then did, and still do, re-
gard slaves as objects of property—objects of trade
or commerce. Hence, having granted to Congress
the power to regulate commerce, they then under-
stood that Congress had entire power even to pro-
hibit any article of commerce, and hence was in-
serted that section, to prevent the exercise of such
power over slaves until "1808, and also to restrict
the laying any prohibitory duty until that time.
Let it be here understood, that the slaveholding
States, in relation to their principal article of per-
sonal property—and without which their lands
would, as they say, be of little value, ill relation to
iheir labor, and of course to its fruit—in relation to
their slaves, they now possess and enjoy a larger
measure ofprotection than any other part of the
country. The importation of slaves is forbidden
only by act of Congress, and Congress has power
to repeal such law at any time, and let in the im-
portation of slaves from Havana, Brazil, or else-
where; and what would be its effect, the southern
gentlemen can best tell us. I have no doubt itwould
diminish the value of all that property one-half in
two years, and we should buy cotton and sugar
less than at present. Men who are thus situated—
who thus live in glass houses—ought hardly to cry
out that Congress possesses no power, under the
grant of power to regulate commerce, to protect or
prohibit any article of importation, but can only
lay a duty such as will let in the article and secure
most revenue. If so, then our laws against im-
porting slaves are unconstitutional.
I wish it further understood that I am now speak-
ing merely on the subject of the constitutional pow-
er of Congress; and I insist thst as to its power
over the subject of commerce, Congress has no lim-
itation but its own discretion. But I now say that,
in the present exercise of that discretion, I consider
no prouibitory laws are necessary to encourage and
sustain our manufactures. It is only necessary to
lay such duties as will raise a revenue required for
the treasury; but, in so doing, discrimination for
protection is necessary.
But it is suggested that the present bill raises the
duty on wool. That is untrue and deceptive. The
present duty, by the act of 1842, is on all wool, ex-
cept that costing seven cents or under per pound at
the place of exportation, SO per cent., and three
cents per pound. This, on wool costing thirty cents,
would be about 40 per cent.; and on -wool costing
less than thirty cenls, it would be over 40 per cent.
The proposed bill takes off the three rents per pound.
Ill relation to coarse costing at the place of exporta-
tion seven cents per pound, or under, the present
duty is five per cent. Now, it is quite certain that
we raise no such wool as this here contemplated.
No wool-grower, in America, raises wool which lie
can afford at seven or ten cents per pound. What
few of coarse woolcd sheep are raised in the south-
ern part of the country for the mutton, and whose
wool is worked into coarse cloths in families, they
need nor ask no protection. It has ever been a pol-
icy, approved by our most intelligent protectionists,
that it is best to let in this coarse wool, which we do
not produce, on the easiest possible terms, that our
manufacturers may compete with the foreigner in
this branch, and furnish coarse woollens on as
good terms as the foreigner, who obtains his coarse
wool on the most favorable terms. But it has been
s.ud that, in fact, some fine wool is imported under
tins provision. It is difficult to see how that is
l"'a Jicab!e, if the law is faithfully executed; nor do
1 Relieve that statement to be true, to any consider-
.leextent. There are two facts which lead me to
t'link otherwise. The first is, that the importation
of that species of wool has greatly diminished un-
der the present tariff—(see appendix, table C,) and
its price has not improved; while at the same time
all our wool of tolerable quality has much improved
ill price. But what does the proposed bill offer? It
proposes to raise the duty on that wool 10 per cent.;
that is, from 5 to 15 per cent. Not ten cents, but
ten percent. Now 10 per cent, on seven cents, will
be seven mills per pound. The whole provision of
the bill is to add seven seven mills on each pound of
coarse wool imported which we do not raise, and
take off three cents per pound on such as we do
raise. This seems to me a miserable attempt to
pull wool over our eyes on this subject. If that
wool does not compete with ours, it is well as it is.
If it does compete with ours, it should be sub-
ject to the same duty; but the proposed bill does
neither. But again, this proposed bill raises the
duty on coarse wool, but it reduces the duty on all
and every fabric of woollens. It compels our man-
ufacturer to import his stock dearer, and yet it lets
ill the foreign woollens cheaper than before. Indeed,
sir, I can hardly trust myself to speak with freedom
of this bill for fear of discourtesy. I ts provisions
betray either the most gross ignorance with the de-
tails and operation of a tariff, or a most indiscrim-
inating and reckless desperation to destroy all home
industry and interests,' in order to repeal a whig
tariff. Instead of any attempt to amend or improve,
it is to demolish and destroy, both in principle and
detail. • v *
I have now shown the origin, history, extent, im-
portance, and pr6sent condition of the wool-growing
interest of the country; and that the necessary con-
sequence of adopting the proposed bill, and the doc-
trines of the report which attends it, will be the de-
struction of this interest. I will now submit some
considerations why Congress should not destroy
this great interest.
First. From considerations of pecuniary interest.
This country is almost exclusively an agricultural
one, and much the largest part of it is a grain and
provision-growing country. So much of it as is, or
shall become, a wool-growing country, is diverted
from the production of grain and provisions, and
they become purchasers and consumers instead of
being rivals and competitors. If we turn our atten-
tion to the returns of 1840, we shall find that Ver-
mont, with all its sheep, produced less than two
bushels of wheat to each person; and in wheat, rye,
and corn, it produced only six bushels to each per-
son. (See appendix, table A.) Now we well know
this is entirely insufficient for its supply. I have
taken some poitis to ascertain what is the amount of
flour imported from other States and consumed in
Vermont, which I personally know to be very great;
and, according to my best sources of information, I
find that while our farmers are directing their exer-
tions to the raising of wool, we actually import and
consume at least one hundred and fifty thousand
barrels of flour annually. Is it best for our wheat-
growing States to destroy this market?
It is generally calculated that what will sustain
ten sheep will sustain one cow. And the grazing of
cattle and producing butter, cheese, and beef, was
formerly our pursuit. Now, can it be best for our
provision-growing States that Vermont should aban-
don the growing of wool, and instead thereof, keep
101,181 more cattle than she now does, and thereby
come into the markets of this country with so much
more beef against the beef of our provision-producing
States' This view is to be extended to the whole
wool-growing employment and interest of the coun-
try.
Secondly. It is exceedingly unkind and unjust.
I have already shown that this business was entered
upon by our people by placing confidence in the en-
couragement of the government. It was entered
upon under the influence of laws passed, without
their solicitation or votes, but conformed to by us as
an obedient people. Shall that confidence be be-
trayed? Will our countrymen, and especially our
highmmded and honorable southern friends, content
themselves with reproaching us as robbers and
plunderers, for conforming our action to the laws of
the country which we did not procure' The system
of a protective tariff has shaped the destiny and
moulded the form of society in New England. We
(■bunged the condition of our agriculture, covered
our lulls with flocks, erected factories, villages, and
even cities on our streams, and though still small,
we now solicit that the wind may be tempered to
the shorn lamb, and that the ploughshare of de-
struction may not be driven over us."
Thirdly. The prosperity of this interest does in-
jury to no one. It is no monopoly, for all may en-
ter into it; and it is capable of being extended to
most States in the Union. But even if it were true
that to some parts, and for a time, their cloths were
to cost little more than if obtained, under a light du-
ty, wholly from abroad, yet that is a consideration
entirely unworthy the legislation of a great nation.
Is there left no patriotism or love of national inde-
pendence in this country. Are we ready to return
to the bondage of colonial dependence upon Eng-
land, even for our cloths—our necessaries of life?
Shall we peimit our manufacturers and artisans to
be deserted, and our .workshops be transferred to
Europe? I cannot but hope our nation will not
voluntarily shear off its locks and grind for the Phil-
istines.
The condition of a nation dependent on another
for its supply of necessary manufactures is forcibly
given us by the sacred historian, in describing the si-
tuation of the Israelites when subjected by the Philis-
tines:
1 Samuel, Chap. Verse 19.—Now| there was no smith
found throughout all the laud of Istael, (for the Philistines
said, lest the Hebrews m^ke tliem swords or spears.)
Verse 20.—But all the Israelites went down to the Philis-
tines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter, and
his axe and his mattock.
Virsf 22.—So it came to pass, in the day of hattle, that
there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any
of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan.
