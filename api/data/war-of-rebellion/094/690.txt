and knowing no one who can perform this duty as well as yourself, he hopes that you will enter upon it at once. Brigadier General M. J. Wright, has been similarly assigned by General Beauregard in West Tennessee; the two portions of the State being in different military departments, renders separate assignments necessary for the present. Please communicate your news freely on the subject, and General Hood will cheerfully extend to you all the aid which the limited means now under his control permit.

Captain W. A. REID,Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General, Corinth, Miss.:

The officers of the military courts must come forward at once, bringing their personal baggage on their horses, or in any other way they can, taking advantage of loaded wagons that may be coming forward, but no wagons can be allowed exclusively for them and their effects. The public service requires that all wagons coming to the army now should bring either ordnance, commissary, or quartermaster stores. When the courts reach the army I will give them such transportation as I can. Order them up at once, in my name.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
