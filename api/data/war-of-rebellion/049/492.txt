when I reach there. It will be very late before the rear of my command gets to its bivouac, and I doubt whether Newton will be able to get more than over the river.

Respectfully,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Germanna Ford, November 26, 1863-3 p. m.

Major-General FRENCH, Commanding Third Corps:

I am instructed to say that General Sedgwick was so much delayed by being obliged to halt at Brandy Station until the Third Corps had cleared the way, and subsequently by the artillery of that corps being stuck at the crossing of Mountain Run, that he will probably not be able to reach Jacobs' Ford before night. You will not move forward from the river farther than to clear the way for him until he comes up and crosses.

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 26, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

There was nothing at the run to stop the batteries. The head of my rear division was within a mile of the ford by 2 p. m.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 26, 1863-2 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

My troops are crossing rapidly. The road on the south side is impracticable for artillery. Captain Tunbull can do nothing for it.

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

JACOBS' MILLS,

November 26, [1863]-4 p. m.

Major J. C. DUANE, U. S. Engineers:

The crossing here is bad, except for infantry. There is a very steep hill on opposite side. Artillery can only get up by doubling teams, and it is difficult then. Road will be impassable on this side if it should rain. I have all seven boats and one trestle in the bridge. I have spoken to General French and advised that all artillery should go by Germanna. It is the worst place I have seen for a pontoon bridge. The Third Corps is now crossing.

CHAS. N. TUNBULL,

Captain of Engineers.
