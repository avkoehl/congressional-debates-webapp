I learn the Tenth Michigan Cavalry will arrive to-morrow. The Clinch was not fordable yesterday. My wagons are ready. Will I go with the Thirty-fourth [Kentucky]? Excuse the question. All quiet here.

BARBOURSVILLE, November 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General McLEAN,

Commanding First Division:

The enemy are at or near Strawberry Plains. You are in no danger. I shall not leave the Gap until Monday. See that every man is sent me that can be mounted. Has Johnson's regiment and detachment Thirty-ninth Kentucky left? Send them without fail; horses can be had at Camp Nelson. Also send balance of Eleventh Kentucky, if it can be found. When all troops have left send a staff officer through, with a small escort, to hurry up the rear. I must have enough to make a force of 5,000.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 24, 1864.

General McLEAN:

My orders to you were to send the whole of Colonel Johnson's regiment (Fifty-third). You will equip it, from Louisville or elsewhere with horse equipments and forward them at once. Use in the place of them their Forty-sixth of Forty-ninth Indiana or One hundred and fifteenth U. S. Colored Infantry, or else Sixth Colored Cavalry, from Camp Nelson. If you need more troops Captain Dickson can order one or two of the four regiments recently received from the front by General Ewing to report to you.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Major-General.

NICHOLASVILLE, November 24, 1864.

Brigadier-General McLEAN:

I am here with Thirty-ninth, Captain Webb, say about 400; will move right on.

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
