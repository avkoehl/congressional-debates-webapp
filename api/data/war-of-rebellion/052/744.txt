General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: There is no truth in the report of rebel cavalry having been on this road. The train is parked at the side of the road about 2 miles from Rossville. I crossed to the east side of the ridge. All appeared to be going well. Our men were advancing, and large squads of prisoners were being brought out of the wood.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding.
