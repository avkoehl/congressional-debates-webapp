HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, April 29, 1865.

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

I have just received the following telegram from the Secretary of War.* Have it copied officially and forwarded to General Wofford with a renewal of the terms sent him some days since, assuring him that he can get no better terms.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, April 29, 1865.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

There are large numbers of paroled rebel soldiers from Lee's army and Forrest's here and coming into our lines at all points, who are utterly destitute, and who will inevitably be driven to stealing and robbery, if not bushwhacking, unless they can be permitted to go to their homes or be provided for in some manner. What shall I do with them?+

JAS. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

DALTON, [April] 29, 1865.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE:

Brigadier-General Judah will move to Resaca to-morrow morning with 1,500 infantry and Merrill's Horse, to give General Wofford an opportunity to surrender, or require him to leave this section of the country. I shall accompany him to Resaca, from which place I will communicate with you.

Respectfully,

JAS. B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, April 29, 1865.

Major-General STONEMAN:

Have just received official notification that Johnston had surrendered to Sherman on the same terms that Lee surrendered to Grant. It will not be necessary for your cavalry to go any farther than to the northern part of South Carolina, unless Palmer hears of Jeff. Davis or his treasure. He must be captured if it be possible. Officers and soldiers of the rebel army will not be permitted to come into Tennessee, Kentucky, or any loyal State.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
