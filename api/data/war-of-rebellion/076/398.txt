General SCHOFIELD:

Keep me well advised to-day, that I may co-operate from all points. I want to know when you are in secure possession of the big Sandtown road, and then of the railroad.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch is received. I have a division covering the Sandtown road, where it debouches from the enemy's line, and hard at work intrenching. All my troops are well in hand to meet an attack.

Major-General SHERMAN:
