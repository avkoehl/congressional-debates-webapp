General JOHNSTON:

I will meet you at the same place as before, to-morrow at 12 o'clock noon.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

IN THE FIELD, April 25, 1865.

(Received 7. 03 a. m. 26th.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding U. S. Forces:

GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your dispatch of yesterday, summoning this army to surrender on the terms accepted by General Lee at Appomattox Court-House. I propose instead of such a surrender, terms based on those drawn up by you on the 18th for disbanding, this army, and a further armistice and conference to arrange these terms. The disbanding of General Lee's army has afflicted this country with numerous bands having no means of subsistence but robbery, a knowledge of which would, I am sure, induce you to agree to other conditions.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

You may see General Schofield, whose army will operate along the road and will guard the construction parties.

I am, &amp;c.,
