eligible, and the office of Quartermaster-General was tendered to General Lawton, who was averse to accepting it if it involved a nomination and new appointment, for the reasons that it withdrew him from service in the field, interfered with his chances for promotion, and that, as he was then the oldest brigadier in the service, he would, by acceptance of a new commission, be deprived of his relative rank as compared with other brigadiers. There were two officers recommended to me as specially fitted to discharge the duties of Quartermaster-General, who could be spared from service in the field, and they were both major-generals and could not

therefore be expected to accept a lower grade in the staff than that which they held in the line.

The name of the officer then performing the duties of Quartermaster-General was also presented to me with recommendations entitled to carry great respect, but my own observation of the manner in which those duties had been discharged had previously satisfied me that the public interest required an officer of greater ability and one batter qualified to meet the pressing emergencies of the service during the war.

On examination of the law above referred to, its language, although not free from doubt, was held, after consultation and advice, to justify the conclusion that the intention of Congress would be fulfilled by assigning to the performance of the duties of Quartermaster-General an officer already confirmed as brigadier-general in the Provisional Army, without again submitting his nomination to the Senate. The grounds for this conclusion were that the eight section of the act of 6th of March, 1861 organizing the Regular Army, expressly authorized the Executive to assign the brigadier-generals to any duties he might specially direct, and when the five brigadier-generals were raised to the rank of general by the of 16th of may, 1861, the President was again empowered to assign them to such commands and "duties" as he might specially direct. As it had, therefore, been permitted by Congress that any one of the generals of the Regular Army might be assigned to staff or any other duty at Executive discretion, it seemed a fair inference that when by the law of last session provision was made that the rank, pay, and allowances of Quartermaster-General should be those of a brigadier in the Provisional Army the will of the Legislature was as fulfilled by assigned to the duties of that office one who already a brigadier-general of the Provisional Army as by nominating a new officer.

This view of the question was fortified by the fact that the law last referred to did not create an office, but only provided that during the war the officer discharging the duties of Quartermaster-General should have the rank of brigadier-general, and by the further fact that the original act of 26th of February, 1861, for the establishment and organization of the general staff, contained a provision still in force, that officers of the Quartermaster-General and other staff departments might by order of the President be assigned to the command of troops, according to their rank in the Army, thus indicating that position in the quartermaster's and other staff department were not distant offices, but were posts of duty to which office of the Army were appointed, and from which they might be withdrawn and assigned to other duties at Executive discretion. This is a provision of our law that did not exist I the former service of the United States, in which when an officers of the Army entered the Quartermaster's Department he surrendered his commission in the line and his right to command troops.
