Military Governor of Alexandria, Va.:

Colonel Gamble, at Camp Stoneman, has been direct to send all mounted men of First and Third Divisions, Cavalry Corps, and of Averell's division, to report to you at 7 o'clock to-morrow morning. General Augur directs that they be sent to Colonel Gallupe, at Rectortown, and that you provide the necessary transportation. A staff officer of Colonel Gamble will report to you to make arrangements. There will probably be 500 men and horses.

Respectfully,

C. H. RAYMOND,

Brigadier General JOHN P. SLOUGH,

Military Governor of Alexandria:

GENERAL: Five hundred cavalrymen will report to you at 7 a. m. October 7. Please push them out by rail toward Rectortown as rapidly as possible. Direct Colonel Gallupe to use this detachment in furnishing couriers to General Sheridan. Early party on arriving within the lines of that army, instead of returning, will report to its regiment. The train should carry sufficient subsistence for horses and men. Please report time of arrival of these troops at Alexandria, and condition.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff, Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 6, 1864-10.10 p. m.

General SLOUGH,

Commanding, &amp;c., at Alexandria:

I shall be in Alexandria about 1 a. m. to-morrow morning, and hope to see you. Has Gallupe all the ammunition he requires? If not, please have some ready to send when the cavalry goes to-morrow morning.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General, Commanding.

I shall require a train guard with me. Please have one ready.

ALEXANDRIA, October 6, 1864.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

GENERAL: I will meet you at the Alexandria depot on your arrival. Colonel Gallupe has, I think, eighty rounds to a man. No more can be had here, if that is not enough.

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General.
