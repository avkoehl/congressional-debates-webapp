Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I find Lieutenant-Colonel Knight, First Delaware Cavalry, picketing White's Ford and mouth of Monocacy. He telegraphed General Tyler asking that the detachment expected of First Delaware Cavalry from Camp Stoneman be sent to him. If I picket the whole line I need them. Captain Pierce reports nothing on Young's Island, and says only three canal-boats have been burned during the whole excitement.

Very respectfully,

J. D. LUDLAM,

Major, Commanding Department.

The battalion of the First Delaware at Camp Stoneman has been assigned to duty in this department, and will report to you for orders as soon as it is ready to move. Inform Colonel Knight.
