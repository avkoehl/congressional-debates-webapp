HEADQUARTERS RESERVE FORCES OF VIRGINIA, January 27, 1865.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Gardner.

The accompanying agreement between the governor of these regiments, and places them under the direct and exclusive command of General Garnder, and empowers him to dispose of the cases here inclosed.

J. L. KEMPER,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, January 26, 1865.

Major DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have nothing of interest to report this morning. Three deserters from the Fifty-first New York Regiment came over in front of Wise's brigade last night. They do not confirm the statement made by the deserters of yesterday that the Fifth Corps had gone to Shenandoah Valley. One man deserted from Wise's brigade last night. The following casualties are reported, viz, Elliott's brigade, 1 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

WILMINGTON, January 26, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Richmond:

General Hoke reports no change in his front. With the very limited means here I deemed it imprudent to move without further information from General Baker, who has been twice ordered to report promptly and in full as to the enemy's forces on the Chohwan. He has moved with all his means, but as yet I have no further report from him. I did not expect to await your instructions, but if the enemy's force as reported on the Chowan came form beyond this department we shall not have the means ot meet it successfully.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Wilmington, January 26, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Northern Virginia:

COLONEL: I inclose a telegram* from Major-General Hoke recommending Brigadier General C. Leventhorpe, of the North Carolina State service, for commission to command Clingman's brigade. The brigade is greatly in need of good commander, and there seems to be but a remote prospect, if any, of Clingman's return.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG.
