Expenditures of the Government—Mr. Beck.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
comparison of the expenditures of the Gov-
ernment between the years 1860 arid 1871.
The report of Hon. Joseph Holt, Postmas-
ter General, for 1860, volume three, part one,
second session Thirty-Sixth Congress,page 420,'
shows that the acttal expenditure of the. Post
Office Department for 1860 was $14,874,772 89;
and tbat the "amount of various appropri-
ations drawn from the Treasury during the
year, as specifically shown by the Auditor, was
$11,154,167 54;" all of which is charged as
part of the $58,955,952 89, which constitute
the ordinary expenditures of the Government
for 1800. In other words, all the actual ex-
penses of the Post Office Department for 1860,
except $3,720,605 35, appear in the table pre-
sented by Mr. Dawes, and are there charged
as part of the ordinary expenses of that year,
while no part of the §25,000,000 collected
from the people by the Post Office Department
is embraced in the table of the gentleman from
Massachusetts in making up the expenditures
of the Government for the year 1871, and yet
he professes to be making a perfectly lair com-
parison of like expenditures during each of
the years to which his table relates. The House
and the country can determine how much jus-
tice or fairness there is in his comparison upon
such data and with such facts, and by that test
ascertain how much his table is worth.
Following that part of the table a little fur-
ther, 1 propose to avail myself of the researches
of my friend from Indiana, [Mr. Holman,]
because he is known to all of us to be unusually
careful in his facts and figures. ' In a speech
made on this floor on the 18th day of April
last, he said: •
"To illustrate tho alarming increaso of our ex-
penditures, I call attention to tho fact that tbe ap-
propriations made tor the lust, yoar of Mr. Buohan-.
ari's administration were $60,277,033, and theso ap-
propriations were believed to be excessive. But to
still more elearly present tho l'act, let us compare
tho appropriations made in the session of 1860-81,
for tho first year of Mr. Lincoln's administration,
■with those for tho present ii-e.il year.
" Tho appropriations for the first year of Mr. Lin-
coln's administration (made before the war expend-
itures began) are as follows:
11 Ilecapituiation.—Appropriation* for 1861.
Legislative, executive, judicial, civil, and miscel-
laneous  $12,501,060 83
Diplomatic and consular   1,036,562 00

valid, and otber pensions  3,802,314 68

emy, and military roads  16,038.645 41
Suppression of Indian hostilities-  3,2 >4,512 20
Post .Office  21.668 101 86
Naval services :  12,790,676 11
Total 871,094,953 09
"'This amount embraces a double appiopriation
for $5,391,353 63 for the same object: one being an
appropriation out of any mon^y in the Treasury,
and contingent unon tho insufficiency of the reve-
nues of the Post Office Department, out of which
tho other is appropriated to meet the same.' (See
Miscellaneous Document No. 44, Thirty-Sixth Con-
gress. page 60,)
" Deducting $5,391,350 63 from tho $71,094,953 09
leaves the actual appropriations made tor the first
year of Mr. Lincoln's administration (made betore
the war expenditures) the sum of $65,703,602 46 for
the ordinary expenses of tho Government, so that
eleven years ago $65,703,602 46 was deemed sufficient
to meet the current expenses of the Government."

"And now, sir, what are the appropriations for
the present fiscal year? I quote from tho Execu-
tive Document No. 5, second session Forty-Second
Congress, page 239 :
JJitimates Appropriations

" From the sum appropriated forlS72 'should be
deducted the appropriations for pensions and inter-
est on the public debt and sinking fund, for these
are results of the war. How then would the account
stand ?

Ordinary appropriations for 1872 $i27,5Qo,763 29
It will be observed by the tables furnished
by Mr. Holman in this speech that in the ap-
propriations for 1872 and in the estimates for
1873 only the deficiency necessary to cpm-
plete the postal service appears, and that the
$25,000,000 collected and expended by the
Post Office Department annually in addition
to the sums taken out of th(i"Treasury are not
taken- into account, while in his table giving
the appropriations for 1861 the whole sum
required lor the postal service, as well that
collected by the Department as that drawn
from the Treasury, is em braced, $21,608,151 86,
being the amount charged to the Post Office
in 1861, against $5,848,125 in 1872, when the
true expenditures of the Post Office Depart-
ment now exceeds $31,000,000 annually. Yet
tables are paraded by the chairman of the
Committee' of Ways and Means before this
House and the country to show how economical
the present Administration is as compared
with that of 18G0, wherein the truth is with-
held in such manner as to make a false im-
pression.
Up to and including 1861, no Postmaster
General ever thought of using the revenues
collected by bis Department without an appro-
priation thereof by Congress. If gentlemen
will turn to volume five, Executive Docu-
ments firstsessionThirty-Sixth Congress, Nos.
19 and 20, they will find the estimates of
appropriations for his Department set out in
detail in communications from Postmaster
General Holt to the Speaker of the House,
showing how much can be appropriated Irom
the revenues of the Department and how
much be added from the Treasury, the total
amount, from both sources in 1860 being
$1-4,871,547," and for 1861 being $15,665,135
The present Administration has learned that
they can make their annual expenditures ap-
pear $25,000,000 less than they really are by
leaving out of account all the revenues col
lected by the Post Office Department. That
is perhaps shrewd management, leaving the
morale ol the thing out of view, but it assumes
another, and much less creditable phase when
the mere deficiencies ot these latter years are
held up in contrast as fair and honest compar-
isons with the total expenditures of twelve
3 ears ago, and the people are asked on tbat
exhibit to' laud the frugality and economy of
the present managers of public affairs.
The deductions in the tabie claimed to be
expenses incident to the war need only be
characterized as preposterous and ridiculous,
not in amount, for they reach the sum of
$40,535,328 <32, but in fact, because after six
years of peace many of thein have no more to
do with war expenditures than they would if
no war had ever existed.
It seems to me that it is extremely far-fetched
to claim that tho debates in Congress have
been more voluminous and costly because of
the war. I think I could show that the Sen-
ate debate growing out of the sale of'the
trench arms, and the personalities which
have followed, covers ten pages of the Globe
for every page relating to the rebellion.
So also the political capital sought to be
made out of the Ku Klux is charged to the
war. I could show that the swarms of re-
tainers and pensioners in all the Executive
Departments of the Government, from the
military aid-de camps who attend the Pres-
ident to the squad of supernumeraries who
are kept on full pay to wind up the clocks at
the Observatory, are wrongfully charged if
they are charged to anything else than the
extravagance and corruption of the present
Administration.
I could account satisfactorily to the country
for all the increase in the expenses of the
Army, without reference to the war, simply
by showing the enormous increase of the pay
of officers and the squads of unnecessary and
useless officials provided for at the public
expense. Perhaps it would be well to glance
at that, as $1G,(S07,973 85 is sought to be
deducted fronii the admitted expenses of the
Army in 1871 because of what are called war
expenditures.
Hon. John A. Logax, while chairman of the
Committee on Military Affairs of this llou.se in
the Forty-First Congress, madea speech which
will be found in volume eighty-one of ihe
Globe, page 150, from which 1 propose to read
a few extracts, as he is a prominent member
of the dominant party, and his statements will
perhaps be regarded as less likeiy to be preju-
diced than niiue. He said :
" Now, sir, I ask why do we spend $37,000,000 on
thirty-seven regiments? I will explain how some
of tho great expense arises. The Army has a great
staff, for which they have bat little use. All these
staff officers require to have horses, forage, commu-
tation ot rations—everything of that kind. For in-
stance. you have a quartermaster's establishment in
jVcwYork. There aic nut live bundled tioops to-
day in the department, and yet they have allowed
for rent ot buildings for licadquai ters and other
offices an amount leaching over thirty thousand dol-
lars a ye.tr. I speak merely of office rent. Why it
isT do not know, but that is the fact, m some mil-
itary departments the rent of headquarters atone is
•$15,0OO. I believe it cost a great deal more than that
ill S.ui Francisco. That is the way in which the
public money is spent for rental ot offices and lor
quarters at extravagant prices lor a gentleman who
is perhaps a lieutenant colonel or colonel.
" Then I want to have the attention of the IIouso
particularly to the law as it now stands on the sub-
ject ot pay. I will show the House what the pay of
each general is: the pay of the General ot tho
Army, pay proper, is $4,800; and wuat is the pay
he actually draws from the paymaster? I have it
certilied by the paymaster that what the General of
the Army is paid amounts to $19,^78. Now, how
does that come about? The excess over the pay
proper is on account ot rations, loragc, commutation
ot quarters, and eveiythmg eke a man can imagine,
summed up together in such a way that neiiher
you nor 1 could sit down and figure it out satisfac-
torily.
" Then, sir, what is the pay of the.Lieutenant Gen-
eral ot the Army ? The pay pioper ot the Lieuteuant
General ot the Army is$3,24Ua year, but he actually
draws $14,803 97, ttie excess being lor commutation
of quarters, foraee, and other things that no one
out of the Army kuows anything about.
"We come next to the major generals. Major
General 11. W.llalleck receives as liis pay proper
$2,640, but he actually draws from tho Government
ifi),862 98. Major General Geoige G. Meade has as
his pay proper !j,2,64d, but be draws from the Gov-
ernment $9,342 05. I do not know why there is this
difference: why it is they do not draw exactly the
same amount. Major General George 11. Thomas
has as his pay propel- $2,640, but he draws flow the
Government$9,524 19. JUujor General W. S. Han-
cock has as his pay propei $2,640, but draws, $9,735 66.
£Idl0/ General J. M. fcichofielil lias as his pay proper
$2.b40. but draws $7,432 92, some two thousand less
than the others. There is a memorandum here that
the reason ot t hat is that he lsnot roported as draw-
ing any commutation: it is not said commutation
Vl- I St-J J'tthout commutation his pay is $7,432 92.
It he had been paid con) mutation he would no doubt
navedrawn as much as the others.
-Che same sort of thing is fouiid all the wav down.
w.r-ri§ar1??' SeneraTs pay per.annum is $1,438 : but
, . .  So,655 61; Biigadiei Gen-
eral Augur draws £o,9o9 40.
"Someof them draw over seven thousand dollars,
some ot them over six thousand doUtirs, and some
oi them over five thousand dollars."
When it is understood that all these enorm-
ous abuses have grown up within the, last few
years, the expenditures' now required for the
