pose such acquisition of power, whether it came
from Henry Clay, William H Harrison, or
Martin Van Buren, that the refusal to receive
State bank paper, went to destroy the power of
the States, &c , and argued that the establishment
of the sub Treasury system would have the ten
dency to bring into existence another national
bank He denied that he and the Conservatives
had formed an alliance, offensive or defensive,
with any party,but that the Whigs had embraced
their opinions, and let come what might, he would
not change his opinions
Mr UNDERWOOD obtained the floor, and
was about to proceed to address the House,
when
Mr CAMBRELENG suggested to Mr Un-
derwood the propriety of delaying his speech
until the committee should take up the other appro
priation bills This bill was of great length, and
would require considerable time to act upon the
various amendments and engross the same, and
the others wc-e very short, and could with facil-
ity be passed through
Mr. UNDERWOOD could not yield to the
suggestion, but proceeded to reply at some length
upon the speech of his colleague, [Mr Murray,]
and upon the question of currency, and the van-
ous other topics which occupy the public mind
at the present day, concluding with the position
that a national bank was the only remedy which
could equalize the currency, and hence he was
opposed to Mr Garland's scheme, for the State
banks would continue to blowup on eveiy revul-
sion or depression, as they had done heretofore
Mr. HALSTED then went mto a review of
sundry small items of contingencies, and m touch-
ing, among other things, upon the Mint estab
lishment, heavened that every dollar coined at
New Oilcans cost th< country two dolíais, at the
othei blanches $150, while at Philadelphia the
cost of coining was only eight mills on the dollar

at the latter place Mr H went over a variety
of othei topics
Mr REED made a few remarks which were
not distinctly hpard
Mr BRONSON remarked that, before the
question was taken, he wished to correct an error
which he had understood had occuired in the re-
port of some remarks winch he had made on m-
tioducmg this amendment He understood (for
even now he has not observed the report) that he
was represented to have chaiged the cleik of the
Supiome Com t with evil piactice orabuse in this
mattti He did not intend to say, and he thought
he did not say, that the cleik had been guilty of
any malpiacticc, and if he ws so leported, he
apprehended that he had been mtsundeistood
He believed thatthechaigcswhich hid been made
by the clerk of the couit weie such as weie au
thonzed by law, or by the rules and practice of
the couit, and it was but justice to the clerk to
say that no malconduct oi abuse was imputed to
him personally But Mi B said that he had
probably stated (and such, as he understood it,
was the true state of the case) that, as the law and
the 1 ules and practice of the court now stood, they
seemed to allow of an abuse, or of something
which operated as an abuse, tow'ards the Gov-
ernment, by permitting the cleik to chaige the
Government for copies of records which had been
printed at the expense of the Goveinment, and he
was still of the opinion that, inasmuch as the
Government paid the expense of printing these
records, they should not be charged by the cleik
for copies of such as were necessary for the At
torney General in suits in which the United States
were interested, and ne conceived that, if such
was the law, it was perfectly competent foi Con
gress now to altei that law, so as to correct this
thing, and relieve the Government from the charge
complained of
After a few remarks from Messrs McKEN-
NAN, SERGEANT, and COR WIN, in oppo
sition to the amendment, and in explanation of
the practice of the clerk,
Mr. BRONSON then withdrew his amendment,

question on its adoption was taken, and decided
in the negative
