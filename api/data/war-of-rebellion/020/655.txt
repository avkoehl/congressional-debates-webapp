with bolt shot for iron-clad boats as soon as possible, and that the casemates in the second tier should be armed with rifled pieces as soon as they are embrasures. Ten-inch guns would be preferable, but it is feared would be too heavy for the arch. Three 10-inch mortars in the fort require new beds; those which they have are useless unless provided with elevating screws. A cupola, now constructing under the supervision of the Ordnance Department for filling shells with molten iron, is slowly being completed. Much of the engineer work lags, and under present arrangement all that can be done by the commanding officer is to report. I would suggest that the officers of the different departments may be instructed to push the work on this fort and supply the material required as speedily as may be.

Should the obstructions be moved to the inner harbor heavy guns on the western face of Fort Sumter will be very necessary. They could be obtained from the requisitions already in when supplied. The garrison will want two more companies.

Fort Johnson, James Island, now armed with two guns, will become important when the obstructions are placed in the inner harbor. Fort Ripley, on the Middle Ground, will also require the guns which have been called for. These and the other projected works in the interior harbor will require a full regiment of artillerists.

Powerful auxiliaries to the defense of the harbor are the iron-clad gunboats of the Navy. Properly manned, they will assist in the greatest degree in increasing the chances of a successful defense, and it is to be hoped that no exertion will be spared to assist their efficiency.

For a prolonged resistance our powder and other ammunition is not sufficient, not being more than 100 rounds per gun. It should be increased by 150,000 pounds of powder at least, if it were possible.

I append a recapitulation of increased force, as estimated by General Gist and myself as desirable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
