SURVIVORS OF WAR. OF 1812.
Mr. WILLARD. I ask leave to report from
the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions
and War of 1812, for the purpose of printing
and recommitment, a bill (H. R. No. 2571)
to amend an act granting pensions to the
survivors of the war of 1812 who served sixty
days, and to their widows, approved February
14, 1871.
Mr. HOLMAN. If that bill is not long, I
hope it will be reported.
Mr. WILLARD. It is a public bill and we
do not ask action upon it now ; but I have no
objection to its being reported.
The SPEAKER. If there is no objection
the bill will be read.
There being no objection, the bill was read.
It provides in the first section that the first
section of an act granting pensions to the sur-
vivors of the war of 1812 who served sixty
days, and to their widows, approved Febru-
ary 14, 1871, be hereby amended so as to read
as follows:
That the Secretary of the Interior be, and he is
hereby, authorized and directed to place on the
pension-roll the names of the surviving officers and
enlisted and drafted men, including militia and
volunteers, of the military and naval service of the
United States who served in the war with Great
Britain of 1812, and were honorably discharged, and
the names of the surviving widows of such officers
and enlisted and drafted men : Provided, That such
widow shall have been married prior to January 1,
1825, to such officer or enlisted or drafted man, and
shall not have remarried.
The second section amends section two of
the act of February 14, 1871, so as to read as
follows:
Sec. 2. That this act shall not apply to any person
who is receiving a pension at the rate of eight dol-
lars or more per month, nor to any person receiving
a pension less than eight dollars per month, except
for the difference between the pension now received
and eight dollars per month. Pensions under this
act shall be at the rate of eight dollars per month,
except as herein provided when a person is receiving
a pension of less than eight dollars per month, and
shall be paid to the persons entitled thereto from
and after the passage of this act for and during the
term of their natural lives: Provided, That widows
pensioned under this act shall, if they become wid-
ows after the 14th day of February, 18/1, be entitled
to a pension only from the date when they became
widows.
The third section provides that all applica-
tions for pensions under the act to which this
is an amendment, heretofore or which may
hereafter be made, shall be considered and
decided as though made under this act-
Mr. HOLMAN. This bill is so manifestly
just that I hope there will be no objection to
putting it on its'passage at once.
Mr. MAYNAKD. I understand the gentle-
man from Indiana [Mr. Holman] to say there
is no objection ?
Mr. HOLMAN. I trust there will be none.
Mr. MAYNARD, If we haveh'S assurance,
of course there will be none.
Mr. .WILLARD. Mr. Speaker, before the
vote is taken upon the passage of the bill I
desire to state the changes in the present law
contemplated by it.
In the first place the bill amends the law of
14th February, 1871, by striking out the limit-
ations both as to length of service and as to
participation in rebellion. Under this bill all
who served for any length of time during the
war of 1812, including Indians, will be en-
titled to a pension; and it is estimated that
by removing these limitations in the law at
least ten thousand persons in addition to those
now entitled will be entitled to pensions.
The bill also changes the limitation as to the
date of marriage of widows, and provides that
all widows married prior to January 1, 1825,
may have pensions. I was opposed to this
