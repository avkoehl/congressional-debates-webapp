HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 2, 1863. [Via Cairo, 6th. Received 12.10 a.m., 7th.]

Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief:

It is impossible with present force to open the telegraph-line from Columbus to Corinth. It will be even difficult to maintain railroad and telegraph from Memphis to Corinth. General Dodge, with eighteen of my best infantry regiments, is ordered to cross the Tennessee, and will leave Iuka for Eastport to-day. The enemy is active in North Mississippi, and increasing his force. I have only nine whole regiments of infantry, including all at Memphis and Corinth, on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

Major-General HURLBUT:

The One hundred and thirteenth Illinois Infantry is at Chewalla; the One hundred and eighth at Pocahontas; the One hundred and twentieth has just reported with train of General Dodge. I shall have to send the One hundred and twentieth to Pocahontas, the force there being entirely too small.
