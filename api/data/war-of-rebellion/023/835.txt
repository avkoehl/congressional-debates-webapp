KNOXVILLE, TENN., September 16, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Richmond, Va.:

I have just received the following:

Please urge your appeals upon the Government. It is a pity and a great loss to the service that this army should remain here idle. It may be a serious matter with East Tennessee. If they are permitted to hold the Gap the people who are about to be conscripted will flock to them by hundreds, probably thousands. They had when they arrived at the Gap about 8,000 stand of arms for them. Some have already been issued, but many are left. We must thoroughly invest the Gap, and it cannot be done by the troops now in the department. The difficulty of foraging our animals and the long distance from the railroad place us in about as unenviable a position as the enemy. We cannot remain here many weeks longer.

C. L. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Prompt action is necessary in this department.

J. P. McCOWN,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., September 16, 1862.

Major General SAMUEL JONES, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Colonel Smith's Legion, with the convalescents, is en route to Kentucky, escorting a large money train. It can be stopped at Jamestown if you can get the arms there. The convalescents would not be sufficient to guard the money without Smith's Legion. If you want it stopped let me know. I know nothing of Douglass' battalion.

J. P. McCOWN,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., September 16, 1862.

Brigadier-General MAXEY, Graham's, Ky.:

The Forty-first Alabama, Colonel Talbird, ordered to Kentucky by way of Knoxville with all the troops I can gather-some 3,000-you to go in command. Give the necessary orders to Forty-first to come here prepared for the march as soon as possible. You can come up this evening and report to me. I want to start you as soon as possible.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., September 16, 1862.

General HENRY C. WAYNE, Milledgville, Ga.:

General Bragg directs me to send all the arms I can collect to Kentucky to arm men who are flocking to our standard. Have you any available to send here? Will be sent under strong escort immediately. Of great importance to arm the Kentuckians.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., September 16, 1862.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

General Bragg directs me to send all the arms I can collect to Kentucky; is very urgent for them. General Maxey goes in a day or two
