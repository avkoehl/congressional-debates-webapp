August 30, 1866.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I most respectfully and earnestly request that the order mustering me out of service September 1 be suspended one month, or until October 5, for this reason, viz: I have been here fifteen months during the imprisonment of Jefferson Davis and been the subject of every kind of abuse, which I consider has been unjust and an injury to my reputation. His friends have demanded my removal and are still doing so through their papers. I am of course responsible for my action here and am willing to take the responsibility one month longer.

Hoping this slight consideration will be granted me in justice to my own reputation, and for the credit of the Government, which I think it affects alike, or will in history.

I have the honor to remain, with the highest respect, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

GENERAL: Inclosed I forward report to Surgeon Cooper regarding health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

P. S. - Your order has not been received at this office.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST. OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be somewhat better than on the 22nd instant. The indications of malarial poison are not so distinct as they were and appear to have yielded to the action of quinine which he has taken. He states his appetite to be slightly improved. The exhibition of fruit has relieved, in a manner, the tendency to constipation. He complains to-day of a pain in the head, caused by having got chilled by sleeping in a draft of damp air.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
