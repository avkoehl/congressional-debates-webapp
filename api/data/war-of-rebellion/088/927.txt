was soon silenced, and did no other damage. My men are generally in good health. I believe Major Ludlow intends to carry out my suggestion of sending over fifty men to capture the enemy's piece to-night. Am to protect the crossing with the light pieces.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding Department:

There was nothing new on my line yesterday. Everything seems very quiet on the part of the enemy; no firing on my front. I had thought some of riding over to see you to-day; if you will be at home I will do so.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy have opened this morning from the large gun reported as being placed recently in position. This gun is a 7-inch Brooke not columbiad, and fires very effectively into the fourteen-gun battery at Fort Wilcox. Traverses will have to be put up at once. I would suggest that two of the 30-pounder Parrotts in the rear, near Jordan's house, be placed in the fourteen-gun battery to silence it, or that the Rodman guns be moved to the proper position in the battery to control its fire.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I send six deserters up. There seems to be nothing new. They all confirm withdrawal of Hoke's division from opposite my right, and that Bushrod Johnson covers the line hitherto occupied by Hoke.
