General C. C. AUGUR:

I think the enemy's line of march clearly indicates that the main attack will be to the right of this point. From here it would seem to the extreme right, that is toward the railroad. It is, I suggest, time to move the reserves up here toward the threatened portion of the front.

JAMES A. HARDIE,

Colonel and Inspector-General.
