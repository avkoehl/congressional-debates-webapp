which it is deduced    This position, they say, has been exem
plifled m fourinstances "
After slating them, the Attorney Geneial then pioceeds
"Whosoever will attentively inspect the Constitution will
readily perceive the force of what is expiessed m the letter of
the convention, 'that (he Constitution was the result ofa spirit
of amity and mutua! deference and concession ' To atgue then
írom its style or arangement as being logically exact, is per
haDS a scheme of reasoning not absol utely precipe     But if the
Constitution were ever so perfect, considered even as a compo
sition, the difficulties which the above doctrine has stated may
besolved by the following remarks   these similai ponéis on
which stress is laid, are eithei incidental or substantive, th t is,
independent poweis     If they be incidental powers, and the
conclusion be, that because some incidental powers, aie e\
pressed, no others are admissible, it would not only be contrary
to the common foims of con&!ructior, ibut -would íeduce the
piesent Congress to th*1 feebleness of the old one, which could
exercise no powers no' expressly delegated      So that the ad
vocates forthepowei ofincoiporation, on the principle of mci
denulity to some specified power, would, notwithstanding this
supposed rule of mtei pi etation, be as much at libeity to insist
on its being in incidental power as ever '
The conclud ng paiagiaj h of the 8th section of the látamele
of the Oonfctitution, which give^ to Conmxss the powei "to
make all laws which shall be necessaiy and proper lor carry
mg into execution the foiegoing powers and all othei power 
vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United
States or in any department or office theieof, ' is a distinct re
cognition of the fatt that it does not piofe«s distinctly and ex
piesslyto set foitli a1! the poweis of the Government, but
merely the great leading heads or classes of powei which weie
designed to be delegated That clause adds nothing to the pow
ers oí Congress, but was l-iseited ev majore cautela to \ icvent
cavil upon the pai t of disaffected individuals as to ti e essential
powers of the Government, when any crisis should ansp,
inasmuch as then efficacy would depend on the mode m which
the incidental power of making proper laws was o\erci-ed
And here, sir, let me invoke once mor*  the authonty of (hit
great and good man, whom I have before cited in relation to this
I o nt I read to you, su. Mi Madison's commentai) upon this
veiy clause, m the 44th number of the Tederahst
" Few parts of the Constitution have been assailed with more
mtempeiance than this, yet on a fair inv estimation of it as has
been elsewhere shown, no partean appear more completely in
vulnerable Without the substance of this powei the whole
Constitution would be a dead letter Those who object to the
article, therefore, as a pirt of the Constitution can only mean
that the form ofthe piovision isimpiopei   !
Aftei staling that the convention might have adopted foui
other methods, namely
1st Positively to have piohit lied the excicisc of my prwer
notexpiessly delegated,
21 To have attempted a positive enumeration of all (hepow
era granted,
3d To have attempted a negative enumeration of those de
nied, or,
4th to have been altogether silent on the subject and show
ing that the first method would have rendered the Consntution
adeadlettei and the second and thud been attended with insu
perable difhculties—he pioceeds thus, to notice the la t
" Had the Constitution been Client on this head, theie can be
no doubt that all the particulai poweis lequisite as means ofex
ecutmg thegeneralpowers would have resulted to the Govern
ment by unavoidable implication No axiom it> moie cleaily
established m law, or in íeaaon, than that uheiet.tr the end ¡s
req tired, the means art authorized wheievei a geneial
power to do a thing is given, every pat tictdat pouei necessity
for doing it is mclud'd
"Had this last method, therefore been pursued by the con
mention, every object now urged agamst then plan would le
main in all its plausibility, and the lealinconvemency would be
incurred of notremoving a pretext which miv be seized on ci i
tical occasion for drawing into question tht, essential powers of
the Union."
No, Mr' So fans it from being true that tln« Government
has no other powers, than those expressly given, that I pro
pose írom another part of the Constitution to show tint 'he
practical enforcement of some of its most impoitant stipula
tions, and those, too, in which thp Southern States die most
deeply interested, depend altogether upon an implied power on
the part of Congress to cany them into effect Anil 1 will
makL itai pear aibO that the Senitor's[>Ir Calho* n's] rule of
construction that the expression of ceitam power-, which
might have been implied is a proof that otheis aie excluded,
contrary to the well known maxim that "expresan coi urn
quae tacitc msunt nihil opeiatum,' is wholly without foun
dation
The greater pait of the powers delegated by the Constitution
aie enumerated in the 8th section ofthe 1st auicle, but not all
of them There are some others and those verv impoiUnt
ones, which are dei ived from the fourth aincle Thus m the
fiist section of that article ir is declared that "full faith and
credit shall be given in each fetaie to the public nets records
andjudieial proceeding  of every other S ate,7' and Confess is
anthonsed to prescribe by law their effect an 1 the minner in
which they shall be proved
I  the next section of the same article ire the following
provisions
lA person charged many State with treason felonv or other
cume, who shall flee hom justice and be foun! m another
Stats shall, on demand of the Executive authority ofthe ^tate
fiom which he fie 1, be delivered up ¡o be íemoved to the ^tate
h ivuu j insdi tiun of the crime
3S > i ^r on held to seivice oi Jahoi in one State under *he
laws theieof escaping into anothei,shall in consequenceofany
law oí íegulation therein, be di chirked from such ser\ice or
labor bu hall bedehvtred up on claim ofthe paity to whom
such sen ice or laboi may be due"
Heie ate two piovisions of vital cw^equente to the Union,
and theie cannot be a doubt that the ( onstiuuion never would
hive been adopted unless the latter provision for the pieserva
tion ofthe property ofthe South had been mseited And yet
there is no £a;/i^^power giveL to Congre->sto legislate on the
subject Indeed, the latter, and, to the South, the most impor
tant provision is onccived m negi ive terms and wouM «ecm,
at a first and superficial view, to be a meie lestnin' on the
powers of the States Here is not onlv no espies gian' of
power toCongies*! to pass any law on the subject, but, accord
ing to the Senators mode of reasoning, that the expiession of
an incidental power excludes others not expressed, the fact,
Independent Treasury—Mr. Bayard
that in the first section of ti is aitiele the general piovi&ion
withiegrirdto lecoids is loll owed by an express autnority to
pass general liws on that subject, would effectually exclude
any implied power to carry these provisions into execution
And yet, sir, who ever doubted the power of Congress to give
efficacy to these piovisions by legislative enactment1 So
far from it, we find that as ear*y as February, 1793, at the
second session of the second Congress, when the vigilance of
public attention had been drawn to the doctrine of implied pow
ers m the discussion whicn had previously taken place mrela
tion to the bank charter, an act of Congress was passed to give
them effect, and which guarded ¡ts execution, in relation to the
first, by fine and imprisonment, and, in relation to the second,
by a penalty of five hundred dollars, besides preserving the right
of iction (or the mjuiy sustained, against such as interfere
with the claimant A stronger case of implied power could not
be put, oi one more at wai with the Senator's tule of construe
tion, than that ofthe law in iclation to fugitive slaves Not
only is there no express grant of powei to Congress, but ihe
terms used are negative, implying irhibition in relation to the
Sfates, and m the very same article wheie a general provision
was made in relation to another subject, care was taken e\
piesslyto add an authority to Congiess to make the pioper
laws for canying it into effect Yet, sir, every one must per
ceive that these are great national provisions, without which
the Union could not have been foimed, and without which it
could not long be pieserved That construction, then, which
weuld rendei them a dead letter, muat be erroneous, as Irus
traung the vny end and purp >se foi which they were in
tended The power to make the law in question i& fairly im
plied on these giounds that the piovisions m question are of
vital impoitance to the Union, that some 'egj&lation is also
lutely necessary to settle the details of proofand mode of pn
ceedmg and some penalty necessarv to guard the rights which
are meant to be tnioiced, ill winch can alone 1 e umfoimlv and
certainly provided (oi by the It^isidtion ofCongress, md as they
wereinuoduced to insure ptactical benefits which can on!y be
realized by the ac'ion ofCongie->s it follows, by necessary con
sequence, i was the design ol the Constitution to confer the
powei to make the laws piopei foi tint puipo^e The lesidtof

s itutiou wou'd boa dead letur I do not wish, however, to be
misunderstood on this point, or to have it supposed that I am

abu«ed their trust
Having, sir, now disposed of the question of incidental
poweis, 1 come to the moie pieciseoneof the right which Con
eiesshas to make any deposit on, tempoicry or peimanent, of
the pioperty and revenues ofthe country to promote the sene

to be an exploded doctrine, depend-- that of making the piopos

that the ol I di pure between Mr Mfuson on the one hand and
Mi Hamilton on the other was no whethei the wordb "etne
