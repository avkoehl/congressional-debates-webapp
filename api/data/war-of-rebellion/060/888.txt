of the Second Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery. I asked him if he could not spare the Second New York Heavy Artillery also, but he thinks it would leave his line too weak. I therefore submit the matter for your decision, with the following remarks: The line of defenses is about 37 miles in length. Some of the works are not completed, and the recent heavy rains have os injured some of them as to require extensive repairs by working parties. They are now garrisoned by ten regiments and one battalion of heavy artillery; effective force about 14,000, or, deducting regiment ordered for Burnside, about 13,000. Very few of these men have ever been under fire and one-third are rear recruits.

The public stores and buildings are guarded exclusively, with the exception of two or three special detachments, by invalids (Veteran Reserves). General Tyler has in front, on railroad and picketing Bull Run and the Occoquan, about 2,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and a battery of artillery. There are also a few companies of calvary and infantry north of the Potomac, guarding railroads and picketing the river to the mouth of the Monocacy.

There are always at the artillery depot a number of batteries, being repaired and fitted out, and at the present time there are some 4,000 dismounted cavalrymen. All these, in case of an emergency, could be armed as infantry and placed in the trenches.

The public stores are mostly in wood sheds, and if into well guarded would be burned by the rebels in this city and Alexandria. The board of officers ordered by the Secretary of War to report on the defenses estimated that, with a covering army in front, they should be garrisoned by 25,000 men and 3,000 cavalry for reconnoitering in front. This was exclusive of the store-house guards and military police. With no covering army the complete garrison should be 50,000. I think the estimates made to the President by the generals under McClellan at the time of his Peninsular campaign were about the same.

I have always considered this line of defense too long, but very able obbiders are of a different opinion. The evil, if it exists, cannot probably be remedied now. Perhaps the forts south of Anacostia Creek might be abandoned. If so, as they bear on the Arsenal and navy-yard, they should be dismantled and the guns and ammunition removed.

I submit herewith a list of the heavy artillery regiments now here, with effective strength, that you may decide what forces shall be assigned to General Burnside's command:
