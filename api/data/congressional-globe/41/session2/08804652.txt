TAXES ON' IXStJItANCri COMPANIES.
Mr. SHERMAN. The Committee on Finance,
to whom was referred the joint resolution
(S. R. No. 205) to determine the construction
of an act to provide internal revenue to sup-
port the Government, and for other purposes,
approved June 30, 1804, have instructed me to
report it back without amendment, and to
recommend its passsage ; and as the Senator
from Connecticut, is very desirous to have it
acted upon I wish to have it put on its pas-
sage now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It requires unani-
mous consent.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I hope the Senate
will give unanimous consent to have tho joint
resolution passed now. It is a matter of pub-
lic importance,
Mr. SHERMAN. It is to remove a doubt
in the construction of an existing law, and will
take no time except to read it.
There being no objection, (he joint resolu-
tion -was considered as in Committee of the
Whole. It declares tjiat tjae act entitled " An
act to provide internal revenue to support the '
Government, to pay interest on the public <3eb|,.
and for other purposes," approved June 30.,
1864, and the several amendments thereto, shall
not be construed sp as to impose a tax on any'
undistributable sum added to the contingent
funcj. of any fire, gnaojpe, inland, life, he^ltU,
accident, or like laSttrance company, or say
unearned premium or premiums received fat-
risks assumed by such companies. -
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. P think if the Senate
will hear with me for two minutes I cau pre-
sent the object of this joint resolution so that
it will bo understood and there will be no
objection to it.
The present law contemplates a tax of one
and a half per cent, upon all the receipts of
insurance companies. It also levies a tax of
live per cent, on all dividends which are made
by insurance companies and on all the surplus
earnings of the companies. The language of
the law is in substance this: it requires the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue to levy a
tax on all sums ad-ded to the contingent fund.
Insurance companies keep their' accounts
differently from almost any other corporations.
A banking institution will open an aecount
with discount, with exchange, with expenses,
and brin| them all together at tjie end of the
year, and the balance will show the profits for
the year ; but an insurance company places to
the credit of the contingent fund every premium
received, so that when a sum of money is re-
ceived for a premium according to the con-
struction of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue it is added to the contingent fund
and subject to taxation. Although the premium
occupies such a position on the books of the
company,y.et until tha policy \yhich was issued
for the premium shall expire it is liable to he
lost, and if lost there is a tax of live per cent.;
not on the profits, not on the gains, but on the
losses. Now, I do not believe that Congress
intended to tax these companies except in the
manner I stated at first, simply on the actual
profit?, This resolution put's a construction
upon tho law so as to enable the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to collect tho tax on tho
profits of the companies, and not on a sum
received when that sum is not a profit.
Tho joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate without amendment, ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, read ths third time,
and passed.
