battery at mouth of Sandy, Paris Landing, and Fort Heiman. Some of their guns are 24-ponderous. They claim that they will hold the place to prevent our running supplies up the river. They have the two transports in running order, and run them up and down river at pleasure. General Burford is in command at present, whose headquarters are on the gun-boat, which they have towed to the Heiman side and are fitting it up for use. I learn the officers are divided as to attacking this place. Some are in favor of it, others opposed.

Couriers from the scouting party at Campbellsville, report nothing seen, but a scouting party of the enemy, FIFTY strong, heard of in the neighborhood. No other information of the enemy. Can you give me any news?

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

I have information which I rely on that Hood's army is not this side of the Tennessee River and has not been, but only a small portion of it, enough to make a demonstration. It is believed that he has gone toward Corinth. If allowed to goes, I would say he is striking for Memphis, or will take the railroad to go by Meridian or Selma back to Georgia. I think it barely possible he is waiting for supplies, with a view to advancing into Middle Tennessee. He knows as well as we do not that this long delay will give us time to prepare for his reception.
