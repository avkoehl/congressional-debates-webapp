Those batteries ought to be here at once. When may I look for them?

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Major-General Foster desires me to say that he requires the services of a company of Sappers, and Miners, regulars, if possible, and when ready to embark, if it is not generally known where they are destined, he would like to have them sent to Beaufort to report to the commanding officer for orders.

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

January 11, 1863 - 8 p. m.

M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

Major-General Foster desires me to say that on consultation with Admiral Lee it was found that the naval vessels would be fully occupied in towing the monitors, and that they could not be relied on for the transportation of troops. He had therefore requested Colonel Thomas officially to take up any transportation he thought proper to replace the navy transports, and it would have your sanction. He says he will require 20,000 sand-bags and 2,000 shovels and spades in addition to those sent to him. He wishes them sent to the quartermaster or commanding officer at Beaufort.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
