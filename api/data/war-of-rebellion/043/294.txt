About 7 o'clock in the evening were moved farther to the left, to support the operations of the Third Corps, in which we were subjected to a considerable artillery fire, with some loss; which duty being accomplished, we returned. About 10 p. m. were placed in position on the Emmitsburg and Gettysburg road and in front of the cemetery, to support a portion of the Eleventh Corps, from which duty we were relieved at daylight on the 3d. About 2 p. m. of the 3d, the artillery fire becoming heavy and general along the line, the brigade was moved quickly to the right, to the support of Captain Ricketts' and other batteries operating on the right of the cemetery. Here we remained about an hour, and were exposed to both the front and rear fire of artillery and the enemy's skirmishers. When about to move on return to the left, I was wounded and temporarily disabled, and the command was transferred to Colonel Lyle, of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment. I remained with the brigade, however, and soon after resumed the command. About 3 p. m. moved rapidly to the left, under a severe fire, to the support of the Second Corps, upon which the enemy appeared to have concentrated their attack, and took position in support of a battery on the right of the Third Division, Second Corps. Brisk skirmishing was kept up with considerable loss on both sides until 9 p. m. About 11 p. m., it being ascertained that the enemy were removing the fences within reach, either for the purpose of making defense against attack or of opening the way, the breastworks in our front were much strengthened by the addition of stone and timber, the brigade working almost the entire night. No change was made on the 4th. The skirmishing was continued with some loss. The following table gives the loss each day:O	Officers. M	Men.

This table does not include the loss of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers on the 1st instant, it being then attached to the Second Brigade, and its loss being accounted for with that brigade. Many reported missing, it has been since ascertained, were killed or wounded. Some were recovered on re-entering the town, and the residue are in the hands of the enemy. The conduct of officers and men, so far as they came under my observation, was in every way creditable. Three officers of General Paul's staff being reported among the missing, I selected Adjt. A. R. Small, Sixteenth Maine, as acting
