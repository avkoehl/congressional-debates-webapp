[Inclosure Numbers 1.] O'BANNONVILLE, May 9, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel J. F. CONOLEY,

Pensacola:

In destroying public property and such as General Sam. Jones has ordered of private property, remember that there is an act of Congress prohibiting the destruction of private property other than what can be used against us for war purposes. Tell your men that much of their regulation as honorable men and true patriots is at stake, and that coolness and judgment must characterize the destruction, and no more than what is absolutely necessary must be burned.

THOS. M. JONES,

Brigadier-General.
