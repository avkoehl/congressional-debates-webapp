and tools used by the carpenter, blacksmith,
and workmen they employ. Go through the
list of our exports and see the millions ot value
produced by the labor, skill, and capital of our
country that must compete with the labor,
skill, and capital of foreign lands. Regard-
less of cost of production, of dear labor, capi-
tal, or any other disadvantage, these exports
must be sold at the ruling prices for our own
and foreign products. We exported in 1870-71

NUMBER NON-PROTECTED.
Those engaged in producing these commod-
ities outnumber those engaged in all other
"industries. Next numerous are the various
local trades and industries which every town
and village affords, likewise taxed but not
benefited by tariff duties.
The number engaged in industries claiming
protection against loreign competition are com-
paratively lew. They comprise only those
whose products are easily tiansportable ; such
as manufacturers of textile fabrics, metals,
earthenware, glass, salt, paper, &c., miners,
and owners of coal aud ore beds. Not one in
twenty of the laborers in all the employments
and industries of the country is benefited Jjy
the high tariff duties. Enumerate the trades
and pursuits of this country. See how many
are burdened, how few aided by tariff laws.
The distinguished gentleman from Pennsyl
vania, [Mr. Kelley,] the feailess advocate of
protective duties, who may well be styled the
apostle of the faith, addressed himself lately
to this theme, Should Congress compel Ameri-
can laborers to work for lower wages? He
mistakes the object of maintaining present
tariff rates. The question is, shall thirty-
eight million consumers in this country be
exorbitantly taxed to keep the profits of capi-
tal and wages of labor excessively higher in a
few employments '.ban in others? The main-
tenance of high tariff rates means nothing else.
Its aim is to divert capital to certain pursuits.
It seeks to keep manufactured products dear
in order to induce investments in their pro-
duction. It affords higher rewards in new
fields of industry, by burdening production
and lessening profits in the accustomed em-
ployments.
For ten years past the unavoidable results
of a necessary war tariff of duties have been
uncomplainingly endured. The practical ques-
tion presents itself for our consideration, is
the continuance of present rates necessary or
defensible? How far can they be safely atid
advantageously lowered without serious dis-
turbance of industries or injustice to invested
capital and impairment of the revenue?
The capitalists engaged in mining and man-
ufacturing pioiess to ask high tariff duties ior
the interests of their' operatives as well as
their own. If their laborers secured these
bounties, other laborers taxed but unprotected
by the tariff might well complain of its par-
tiality and injustice.
TAKIFF BOUNTIES.
How much is the per capita bounty to his
operatives each manufact.uier claims should be
paid to him to maintain his establishment, it
is not difficult of computet,ion. The statistical
tables of importations and of domestic produc-
tion in this country give the total consump-
tion. the census statistics the number of per
sons employed, aud the tariff laws the rate
of duty by which the price of the domestic
article is sought to be enhanced above the
foreign. I append a table giving the bounty
allowed by present laws to manufacturers
engaged in producing some of the most neces-
sary articles of comfort, health, and enjoyment:

TARIFF PENSIONERS.
The Commissioner of Pensions reports
92,667 Army and Navy pensioners. He states
the total number upon his rolls, including
widows and others, at 207,495, requiring the
annual expenditure of $22,804,994. This is
not half the number for whose support pen-
sions are claimed and the people taxed—not
a tenth of what is paid. Those who lost
health and limb in their country's service are
the rightful recipients of the nation's bounty.
The orphans' or widows' scanty allowance
does not requite the debt due to the dead
soldier. The loyal tax-payer sanctions with-
out murmur the transfer of his hard earnings
to provide for such pensions. But who are
these drawing pensions from the general
wealth? Where are they maintained? They
are the protdgis of the present tariff laws,
the owners ot coal and ore beds, and manu-
facturing capitalists, who exact contributions
from consumers to swell the profits of their
investments. They resist reductions in ex-
cessive rates ; they ask that high duties shall
be perpetual. Their exactions cease to be
temporary bounties; they ask life pensions.
_ The tariff taxes are assessed and the boun-
ties paid through the laws of trade, instead of
t Tons.
passing through the Treasury and the Pension
Bureau. The tables I submit show nearly
four hundred thousand able-bodied men for
whom manufacturers ask tariff pensions; not
those worn-out or disabled in the public ser-
vice, but those still vigorous in private employ-
ment; not objects of charity, suffering and
in distress, but surrounded with comfoits and
abundance. W'hy should these men be placed
upon the pension-rolls that manufacturers may
swell their own profits ? Why should farmers'
sons and farm laborers toil from the rising to
the setting sun to contribute for the support of
manufacturing establishments in distantStates?
How liberal the pensions the manufacturer
asks and appropriates 1 The half-disabled
soldier must be content with four dollars per
month; fifty dollars a year is more than can
be afforded to aid him. The soldiers' widow
is considered entitled to eight dollars a month.
That sum is deemed sufficient to make good
her pecuniary loss. But the owners of coal
and ore beds and iron-masters draw for
each miner, smelter, and puddler employed as
much as the widow and half-disabled soldier
together receive. The one-armed or one-
legged veteran is entitled to his fifteen dollars
a month, while the cotton manufacturer takes
for his operatives twenty-three. The glass
manufacturer deems himself well entitled to a
dollar a day from the general bounty for each
blower he requires. A yearly bounty of $345
is none too high, while the disabled commander
of a regiment is limited to $300.
pension frauds.
The country was startled by the announce-
ment that great frauds had been discovered in
the administration of the Pension Bureau.
Fictitious names were upon the rolls. The
ghosts of deceased pensioners quarrerly, as
pay day came, revisited the pale glimpses of
the moon and left legible evidences in regular
receipts for the Government bounty their un-
substantial forms were supposed no longer to
require. An Indian pension was sufficient to
induce virtuous traders to forego the sweets
of civilized life and doff the trappings of the
Ute or Camanche. Only a few thousand dol
lars was thus fraudulently drawn, but how
indignant the feeling that, sacred trusts were
thus betrayed or careless officials overreached !
Yet all the while millions upon millions of
the bounty claimed for the laborers in favored
industries have been misappropriated and
diverted by capitalists and employers.
No wonder that mechanical labor is discon-
tented. If we believe their employers, the
pay-roll here is higher than abroad for the
same labor, and yet strikes and unions. As a
distinguished agitator says, the nation is slum-
bering upon a volcano. New England asks
a labor commissioner to investigate these sub-
terranean rockings and mutterings. Gentie-
men, the laborer sees the result of your system
but cannot apprehend the cause—adventurous
manufacturers amassing fortunes, building
palatial residences, immense warehouses and
factories, becoming large landed propiietors,
and investing surplus wealth in bonded securi-
ties or mortgage loans. In contrast, the laborer
sees his seeming liberal wages absorbed in
increased expenditures. At the end of the year
no richer, or at best but a few dollars remain-
ing of the scanty savings of weekly toil, he sees
there must be injustice and wrong when capi'al
grows rich and swollen upon his earnings, and
no share of the profits comes to him. He has
heard that making the products of labor dear
is a protection to industry, and, credulous and
unreasoning, he believes the tariff and the
debt which requires it national blessings. He
knows not that this system grinds upon
national industry to fatten wealth. He sup-
poses it is the currency, the use of coin, the
rate of interest, congressional land grants or
railroad oppressions that keep him poor and
have made his employer rich. He has never
investigated to ascertain the enormous boun
ties paid by the nation through the protective
system to manufacturing capitalists, and how
little comes back to him.
But our farmers are threatened that in case
these bounties stop manufacturing States will
cease to consume farm products, as though
food could be dispensed with. Who believes
that coal-mining, or the making of iron, steel,
ortextile fabrics would materially decrease if
the duties were reduced? Who supposes they
would wholly cease if duties were restored to a
revenue basis?
