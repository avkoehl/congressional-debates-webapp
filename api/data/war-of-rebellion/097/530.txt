HEADQUARTERS MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,April 3, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General J. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff to General Sheridan:

I have the honor to report that the wounded of the cavalry and Fifth Corps were left at the following places for want of transportation to send them to the rear, namely: Dinwiddie Court-House, Union, 25; Confederate, 5. There may be more at this place, but these are all that have been officially reported. Fifth Corps hospital, Sutherland's Station, on South Side Railroad, about 100; and perhaps 15 cavalry men wounded in skirmishers and left in houses in that vicinity. Twelve Confederate wounded were captured in cars and left at Ford's Station, on South Side Railroad. Medical officers were left with all these wounded, and they were supplied with everything sufficient to last them three days. I respectfully suggest that the wounded remaining at the places mentioned be sent for at once, and the battle-fields near Dinwiddie Court-House and Gravelly Run Church, and the houses in their immediate vicinity, be thoroughly searched for any wounded who may have been left in consequence of the rapid movements of the army and the very limited transportation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. T. GHISELIN,

Surgeon, U. S. Army, Medical Director.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding Armies of United States, with a request that the wounded men of the cavalry now in the vicinity of Dinwiddie be collected and sent to City Point in the ambulances belonging to the troops now at City Point.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Prisoners are coming in constantly. Enemy has without doubt left Petersburg. There seems to be immense demoralization in the rebel army. We have prisoners from Heth's division of Hill's corps. They seem to have been badly beaten in the attack by our army. They say another fight will be made for Richmond, but think everything is gone up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.

APRIL 3, 1865-12 m.

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I shall press on with two divisions and with Mackenzie's division, if he comes up, to Bevill's Bridge across the Appomattox. I learn that twenty-three miles of wagon trains are ahead. If a division of infantry is pushed up their capture is insured.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.
