Colonel Shields, Thirtieth Louisiana, commanding separate detachment, who speaks in high terms of the intrepidity of Lieutenant Fauntleroy, commanding section of guns in his detachment. Captain Semmes, commanding battery, and his officers, Lieutenants Barnes and J. A. A. West, performed gallant service. Captain Blount, brigade inspector of Second Brigade, rendered gallant service in the field. It is believed he has fallen, as nothing has been heard of him since.

I also have the gratification to name the members of my staff who served with me on this occasion, viz: Lieutenant L. D. Sandidge, corps artillery, C. S. Army, acting assistant and inspector-general; Captain George Whitfield, chief quartermaster; Major E. S. Ruggles, acting ordnance officer and acting chief commissary of subsistence; First Lieutenant M. B. Ruggles, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Col. Charles Jones, who was severely wounded, and Col. J. O. Fuqua, district judge-advocate and provost-marshal-general, who were all distinguished for efficiency, coolness, and gallantry throughout the conflict.

The following officers, attached to the general staff, also rendered gallant service: Captain Samuel Bard, on special service; Lieutenant A. B. de Saulles, engineers, and Lieuts. H. H. Price and H. C. Holt.

Other officers on special service, among whom were Captain Augustus Scott, commanding squadron on temporary service; Captains Cuney and Henderson and Lieutenant Behan as volunteer aides-de-camp for the occasion, and Captain J. M. Taylor served with zeal and gallantry.
