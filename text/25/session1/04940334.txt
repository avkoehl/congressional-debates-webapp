We can often, Mr Chan man, look into th*1 future by the
lights of the jiast \nd the past furnishes to my mn d the mo^t
conclusive evi lence that a United Sia*es Bank is highly, almost
indispensably, necessaiy, fo promote the rapid and uniform
prosperity of the nation Without monej no business can pros
pei, and without a convertible cnrrenc}, andaneai i mformity
of exchanges the piospmity of all business ib in a eieat degiee
paraly7ed Whilst the 1 equality if exchange^ m idejieciat
ed currency will secuie vsealth to the brokeis and money ex
changers, in the &an e ie¿iee will it dimmish the profits of the
farmer and the merhann , of the met chant and tl e man of use
ful enteipnse
Whenevei we ha\e had a X nited fetales Bank, we have had
eveiy where a conveit hie redeemable currency by which the
value of property comd be clearly estima ed, \\ nenes er we
have not liad a Bank ol the TJmted States we has e bid a stop
pase of specie paymen dMiess and 1 idivilual íuin If vte
aie to judge oí effects by causes what can be more convincing
andconelusivei When the Bank of the Tinned States \\a<* n
existence, exchanges fiom New Oileans to ISew Yoik wue
never more than one per cent tten at par, and sometimes,
from one city to the other, above par There was then but a
teasonable and u-seful number of State banks
How are the exchanges now? We can sometimes judge of
great things by small A fuend sent me a hundred dollar note,
a few days ago, on a bank 111 rionda, which he had been ti ymg
to oass off, but could not 1 went toabrokei, and he untied
me seventy five dolíais in JDistiict^ aper forthehundred dolíais
on the F'onda bank I offered him the note foi eighty five dol
lars, and he refused it I called on the Delegate Irom Honda
to know whether the bank was good lie informed me that it
was perfectly solvent, and as «otind as any hank in the woild
that its paper passed freely in Florida 1 hen a man who ow es
a debt of sesenty fh e d<>! jis m this c \ nin myic lit ui
Honda will hate to pa\ one hnndied d > i is 1 r ¡ ei whth
he tikes at par at home to liquid ne his habd t> sn th s ci y
Such ist thed scountat but one half the extent of  m nation It
mv mind had es er doubted on the stibject of the expediency of
a United States Bank, th s single cncum«tance would h tve ie
moved every dot bt The Government has disconnect d it°elf
bom the cunency, and all thinysaie in confu^i n and I fear
will lenmn so until we have what was ippiopmtely cahm1

they receiveforthisimmense purrend^i of State sovereignty,
but that the Government would extend itP natern d care to ef
iecta good currency and safe and easy exchanges? But the
President, with a profound ignorance of both the spirit and the
intention of the Oonstitstion, nas told us that the people might
as well expect the Government to aid m the transpoitation of
their merchandise, as totano or establish a good system of ex
changes It is he firct tune that an Amencrn President has
uttered such a sentiment of di^e^ai 1 to an injured people,

sered that they are totally ignorant of the «¡ubject, and huve

I will use this occasion to express my uttpr abhorrpnc- of the
lone essays which are annually given by our Executive to the
representatives of the people and the States The Executive
seems to think it his duty to send ua a long lecture upon our
pub'c duties and assumes as much importance as if he were a
profesor Vet urine a class of sophomores upon the principles of
philosophy, and schooling us in the line of our duty
Ihe King (or now the Queen) of England and the King of
France send their messages or speeches to the Parliament or
the Chamber of Deputies, of about a span's length simply say
1 ne' that the nation is at peace with the world the King is thank
fdfor the supplies granted, and that he will take pleasure m
c rrymg out such measuresa,s the Parliament or Chambers may
think proper to promote the interests of the nation If either
the King- of Fngland 01 the King of Fiance weie to threaten a
veto, reithei would hold hi^cio.vn a month, ii he would escape
with Ins head I think it ought to be an impeachable oiience
for any Executive office] of Go>einmentto send a message 01
communication to Congre^slongei than a column of an ordinal y
newspaper, unless, after tl at space, statistics and tabular exhi-
bits should require more
The Secretary ofthe Treasury has sent us a volume of ei£;h
ty eight large page", laying off Ins sul ject, like the monger in
giavehistoiVjlnto "seven heads and ten horns "   I base lead
it by candlelight and by daylight, and m groping thiough it
foi a clear idea, I could not find one'   Now and then >ou will
find a beggarly thought enshrouded m a whole n 1st ai d cloud
of w oid*     But his thoughts and  ideas are like the arts of
the cnttlc-fMi, which, natuialisu inform us, when pursued,
thiowsout, a* cpuck as magic, adaik liquid, which embanastes
and besvilders its pursuers, wluK it escapea fiom pursuit amid
its own «elf created darkness     \ou puisne his thought**, but 111
the pursuit you aie left in darkness    If the Secretaiy ofthe
Treasury is a man of delicate and refined feelings, 1 would not
ha,e   uilued the perturbation of mind which he must have ei*
dine 1, whilst he was t! inking of and writing that report, foi all
the ¡ublic money which he has lundled for the last four y tais
I could never fully realce to m\ mind the de«cnption which
Milton has given one of his heroes, who was confused and dis-
appointed, until I lead the Secretary of the Treasury's report
Milton deociibes a personage who attempted a great íeform—
not, perhaps, in curi ene y, but in civil government—(and m quo
ting Milton, I do not wish to interfere w ith the ci lucidme of my
eloquent friend fiom New York, (Mi  Hoffman,) and my no
legs able friend from feonth Carolina, (Mr Ficken«,) who have
rendeied him, by the r able leview, of such questionable autho
nty )   This teformerwas disappointed, as the Secretary has
been, and was humbled nom his Inah estate, and "nine tiirrs

The Secretaiy of the Ireasivy is an officii not known in the
Constitution Then, undtr the <" on^atunon, he can claim no
powers He has bf* n created b> lav*, and to that law he should
look for not only his existence as an officer oí the Governmei t,
butf r tne powers and di ties which have been assigned to him
And he should look to all the laws (and not to the Executive)
which assign him dime*, for the quantity and discretion ot duty
which maybe imposed upon him to dischaisce He 19 not to
look to the nominating power foi bis authonty of action, but

Those who urge that the President has entire control over
the Sscrctary of the Treasury, because he has the pow er under
the Constitution to nominate to office, run into e(ror, and, ia
order to make their constmction moie plausible, assume (what
is not the fact) that the Secretary is a mere subordinate auxilia
