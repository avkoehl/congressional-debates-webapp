HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 30 [31], 1864 [1865]-7.40 m [sic]. (Received 8.50 a.m.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

Please let me know where your right will rest that I may connect with you. General Miles has already relieved General Griffin, and I find a vacant space on his left.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-9 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I send you a sketch* of the country west of the plank road and a copy of my communication to General Webb as to my position. I cannot take up any regular line of battle on account of the woods and swamps, but have assembled each division at a point so they can fight in any direction with the line refused. I had Griffin's and a battery stationed at Stroud's, with support. I don't think your left could be turned, even if I moved away, without your having full information; but as my troops now are, I could move Griffin right up on your flank with my artillery. I shall work hard all day to get the road through the woods in order.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,March 31, 1865-9.45 p.m. (Received 2.55 a.m. April 1.)

General WARREN:

I am directed to resume the position of this morning, holding as far as Mrs. Butler's and the return. As the return is your work, and as I do not know it, will you let me know if it rests on Gravelly Run, and if not, upon what it does rest.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.

MARCH 31, 1865-11.30 p.m.

(Received 12.40 a.m. April 1.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

I am directed to resume my position of this morning, &amp;c. At what time do you propose to move? I propose to move simultaneously with you.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
