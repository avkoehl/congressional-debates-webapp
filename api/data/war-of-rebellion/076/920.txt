(Received 7.40 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Your dispatch of 6.10 received. The general says it will be necessary to change our lines to-night. Please ride in and bring General Bate with you, if all is quiet.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

JULY 28, 1864-3.25 p. m.

(Returned to headquarters 5.15 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General STEWART:

General Hood directs me to say that if you are pressed you can draw a brigade or so from Bate, but he does not want you to weaken his line more than you can help. He desires you to hold the enemy, but not to do more fighting than necessary, unless you should get a decided advantage. It may be well for you to cause Bate's skirmishers to threaten the enemy in your favor.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]

JULY 28, 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General CHEATHAM:

Please ride to headquarters. General Stewart is wounded.
