In obedience to these directions I at once gave orders to Generals Morgan and Steedman to put their commands in readiness to move at any moment, and be ready to start from Athens as soon as possible after railroad transportation reached them. General Morgan informed me at noon to-day that he was ready, and I doubt not but that two brigades of his are already on their way, as sixty cars were sent by the superintendent of the military roads to Athens to-day. I have ordered two regiments of Steedman's, which were at Tullahoma, down to Chattanooga, and the remainder of Steedman's command will follow these as soon as it returns from the pursuit of Forrest. I have no further intelligence from the remaining portion of my command to report to-day.

General THOMAS, Nashville:

Come to chattanooga to take direction of matters from that quarter. Leave orders with General Webster as to the troops to follow. Stevenson and Bridgeport should be re-enforced.

General G. H. THOMAS, Nashville:

The brigade of Colonel Hoge is doubtless the one ordered to Eastport. He seems to have got there too late, for the enemy cannot operate that road with Eastport in our possession. That brigade and gunboats should patrol the Tennessee River as high up as they can go, and in time I will re-enforce the command.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, October 12, 1864-8. 30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

In obedience to your directions, captioned in dispatch of last evening, I at once gave orders to General Morgan to put his DIVISION in readiness to move at once to Chattanooga. He reports to me to-day at 12 noon that all was ready, and I presume that two of his brigades have already started, as Mr. Anderson, superintendent of the road, informs me that he had sent sixty cars to Athens for General Morgan's troops. I have also sent two regiments of General Steedman's command, which came up as far as Tullahoma, back to Chattanooga, and the balance of his command will be sent after these as soon as it returns from the pursuit of Forrest. I have already issued orders to Major-General Steedman in the case, and there will be as little delay as possible in pushing forward the troops.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
