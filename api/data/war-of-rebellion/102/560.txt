SIR: From the report of General Sherman, commanding Southern Division of Louisiana, is appears that the post of Brashear, La., will have to be temporarily evacuated. In that event the post will have to be left in charge of the gun-boats to prevent the enemy securing a foot-hold upon the falling of the waters. I therefore respectfully request that at least one additional gun-boat be sent to Brashear City as soon as practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,
