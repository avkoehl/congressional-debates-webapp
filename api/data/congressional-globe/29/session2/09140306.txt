APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Increase of the Revenue—Mr. Poyne.
Ho. or Reps.
would do the same thing again. But under existing
circumstances—your country at war, and your na-
tional debt rapidiy increasing—I would do almost
anything else, sooner than vote against the meas-
ure.
Sir, I have said, that in my opinion, there are
but two certain modes of providing for the pay-
ment of the war debt, viz: direct taxation, or a tax
upon the free list. The foimer I oppose, the latter
I approve, and have given my reasons for doing
so. It now remains for me to show, if 1 can, that
an increase of duties "upon articles now taxed un-
der the existing revenue system, would not in-
crease the revenue; and hence a resoit to that
policy, as a means of providing for the payment .
of the war debt, will prove a deceptive failure. I j
desire to do this, because many are in favor of pro- j
vidmg for the payment of the debt by that means. J
1 maintain, as a proposition not to be doubted, j
that there is, in levying duties upon imports, a J
precise point, above or below which you cannot i
go without diminishing revenue. What that precise j
point moy be, it is difficult, nay, almost impossi- j
ble, to ascertain; but still it exists. No one will i
doubt, I imagine, that the circle has its square; and I
yet all the learning of mathematics, aided by the
ingenuity of man, has never discovered the "square
of a circle." So it may be in levying duties upon
imports, the exact revenue point may, possibly,
never be discovered; still that point exists, and, if
ascertained, would raise the largest amount of revenue.
If your rate of duty is above the revenue point, by
diminishing importations you lessen the revenue; if I
the rate of duty js below the revenue point, the !
increased importations, resulting from diminished !
duty, will not supply the deficiency of revenue. j
Now, sir, as the exact revenue point in levying I
duties upon imports cannot be determined with I
precise accuracy, all that we can do is to approxi-
mate it as nearly as possible. How are we to do
this? It can be done only by examining the his-
tory and progress of our legislation upon financial
questions for years past, and particularly observ-
ing its eifect upon the revenues of the country.
This I have done, and have satisfied my mmd be-
yond a doubt, that the existing duty of 30 per cent,
ad valorem is very considerably above the true
revenue point; and, judging of the future by the
past, I am prepared to prove that an increase of
duty upon articles now paying a tax of .SO per rent.
ad valorem will prevent an increase of revenue cor- |
responding with (he augmented consumption of )
our rapidly-incrcasing population. ;
I now present to the committee a tabular state- i
mcnt showing the amount of revenue collected |
under the low duties of 1800, embracing a*period
of seven years, prepaied with great tare, and re-
plete with information upon tins subject. The
articles taxed by the tat iff bill of 1800 were divided
into three classes: one class paving a duty of 5 per
cent., another 15 per cent., and a few other articles
20 per cent. It is also worthy of especial con-
sideration, that more than two-thirds of the entire
revenue from customs was collected upon those ;
articles paying the 5 per cent. duty. Here is the
table:

By this table it appears that our population had
increased, in 1830, to 12,866,000 souls. The rev-
enue collected per annum was $22,169,521, and
amounted to $1 72 per head; which shows a de-
crease of revenue per head of ninety-six cents per
annum, and an aggregate decrease of revenue, ac-
cording to population, as compared with the low
duties of 1800, of §12,351,460 per annum. If the
revenue collected under the high duties of 1824 had
equalled, per head, the amount collected under the
low duties of 1800, your annual revenue from cus-
toms under the tariff of 1824 would have been
$34,547,667 per annum, instead of $>22,351,460 per
annum.
These facts are important. The tariff of 1824
was the first protective tariff ever adopted by this
Government for the sake of protection; and its
rapid decrease of revenue, according to population,
demonstrates the impossibility of combining the
principle of protection with the principle of rev-
enue by any scale of duties you may devise. One
or the other must go to the wail. They cannot
stand together.
Let us now turn to the tariff bill of 1842. I present
to the committee a similar tabular statement, show-
ing the effect of the high duties imposed by that
bill upon the revenue.

C tabl,e k 18 seen that' wuh a population of'
iMUU,Udu souls,^ the annual revenue collected was i
&14,185,367. Tins is the largest revenue ever col-i
lected from customs in proportion to the population '
It amounts to §2 68 per head. Every increase '
oj duty, from that day to tins, lias resulted in a de- Ij
create of revenue according to the population. |j
1 next invite your attention to a similar tabular t|
statement, embracing a period of seven years, un- [i
bill ofl834 Pr0tectlve duties imposed by the tariff ji
1 This table embraces the entire existence of the
I tariff bill of 1842, for which 1 could procure the
! estimates. In 1844 our population had increased
to 18,500,000 souls. The revenue collected per
annum was ^29,143,635, amounting to $1 57 per
head, thus showing adccrcaseof revenue, as com-
pared with the low duties of 1800, of $1 H per
head; and an aggregate loss: of revenue, according
to population, of £20,533,000 per annum. If youi
revenue had not been diminished by the incieased
duties of 1842, assuming as the basis of the calcu-
lation the amount of revenue collected under the
low duties of 1800, you should have collccted
under that bill $49,678,635 per annum, instead of
$29,143,635 per annum, which you did collect. It
is also worthy of especial observation, that the
declint of revenue, according to population, was
greatei under the tariff of 1842 than it was under
the tariff of 1824. VV"hy is that the case ? Because
the duties upon imports were higher under the tariff
of 1842 than they were under the tariff of 1824.
Thus establishing the fact, as I humbly submit,
that every increase of duty upon imports has been,
and must be, followed by a decline of revenue, ac-
cording to population, when the duty levied is
above the revenue point.
Now, sir, I cannot say, certainly, that the low ■
duties levied upon imports by the revenue bill of;
1800, embraced the cxact revenue point, and raised i
the largest amount of revenue which could have ■
been collected by a duty on imports. 1 will not
say so. But I do contend, and have demonstra- !
ted, that more revenue was collected, according to j
population then, than has ever heen collected since;
and hence 1 infer that the low rate of duty of that !
period approximated more closely the exact reve- j
nue point than any subsequent duty has done. ;
Well, sir, if your duties upon imports now taxed i
are above the revenue point, and you increase i
them, a reduction of revenue, according to popula- '
tion, is the inevitable consequence. That must be j
the result, if the experience of the past enables us
to judge with the least certainty of the future.
To attempt to provide for the payment of the
war debt, by increasing the duty upon imports
now taxed, would therefore prevent an increase of
revenue corresponding with the rapid increase of
our population. This must ultimately weaken our
financial resources, and finally end in ridiculous
failure. Let us not rely upon such expedients,
but let us rely upon the more certain mode of pro-
ducing the required amount of revenue by levying
a duty upon the free list.
Mr. Chairman, it may be supposed that the enor-
mous amount of revenue collected under the low-
duties of 1800 was the result of entire dependence
upon foreign manufactures for our supplies. No-
thing is further from the truth. What amount of
manufactured goods were produced in the year
1800, or between the years 1800 and 1810, I have
no means of ascertaining, no statistics having been
compiled between those years; but they must have
been considerable. Tench Coxe, who was engaged
in compiling statistics upon manufactures between
the years 1810 and 1813, and whose authority will
not be questioned, says:
" In the course of the numerous and diversified opeiations
occasioned by the deliberate execution of this digest and
statement, constant and very close attention lias been ap-
plied to those facts which have occurred throughout the
Union, since the autumn of the year 1810, from which a
judgment of the condition of manufactures of the United
States, in the current year J813. might be safely formed. It
lias resulted in a thorough conviction that, after allowing for
the intenuptions to the importation of certain raw mateiials,
the several brandies of manufactures m the States. Territo-
ries, arid DiMriet^, have advanced upon a medium at the lull
rate of twenty p<*r centum, which would give an aggregate
for this year of >$07,315,000.
"But as it is best to make ample allowances for some
manifest repetition of articles wim-h are mextiieubh in-
volved in the subouhnate returns, a sincere and well-re-
flected final opinion is respectfully offered, that the whole
people of the United States, taken in 1813 at 8,0<)0 000 of
persons, will actually make within tins year manuiactuied
goods (exclusive of tne doubtful) to the lull value of 200.000,-
000 of dollars, or 45,000,000 of pounds sterling money.-''
This prodigious manufacturing interest was not
the growth of three or four years; it commenced
with the colonies, and strengthened with the Gov-
ernment, and in the year 1810 amounted to $25 per
head for every man, woman and child m the re-
public. It was not, therefore, the absence of
manufacturing establishments in America, or de,-
pendence upon Europe for manufactured goods
which produced the immense revenues under the
low duties of 1800. Far from it. It was but the
legitimate result of unshackled commerce and the
unrestricted interchange of the products of different
' countiies, upon principles of commercial freedom,
j combined with a system of finance, looking to
! revenue only. Now, sir, if we permit the duties
to remain as they are, the revenue will increase to
some extent with the increasing population. But
if you reduce the duties to a revenue standard,
; then the increase of revenue will be rapid, bearing*
| an exact_ proportion to the growing necessities of
I your rapidly-increasing population. If these views
i be correct, great will he the folly of that man who
| recedes one inch from the ground we now occupy,
| and wise will be the statesman who is the first to
: advance another step in the great highwav of com-
! mercial freedom. Sir, I trust the financial officer
j of this Government, at least, will have the moral
i courage to meet this crisis. Let him submit no new
1 financial measure to Congress; and if we fail in
the perfoimancc of our duty in providing the re-
quired amount of revenue, the responsibility falls
upon us; but if he yields to temporizing expedients,
the responsibility rests upon him.
Air. Chairman, are there no other reasons, inde-
pendent of diminished revenue, why the duties
upon imports should not be increased ? In my
opmion_ there are other reasons against it equally
conclusive. If high duties have heretofore dimin-
ished your imports, and thereby your revenue,
according to population, they have also diminish-
ed your exports m a greater ratio. I shall enter
upon no theoretical reason to prove this position,
1 appeal to facts, and submit them to the candid
men ot all parties. Relying upon the correctness
of my own investigations, and in their patuotism,
I have no fear that we shall ever again lesort to
high duties, either for revenue or any other pur-
pose.
I now call the attention of the committee to the
following tabular statement of annual exports, em-
