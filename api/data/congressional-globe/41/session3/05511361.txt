It was undoubtedly the intention of the
Committee on Military Affairs to make their
reform thorough, and to reduce, generally, the
pay of officers, and therefore I offered the
amendmentwhicli Isent to thedesk, and which,
I regret, to say, the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Dickey] objected to and the Chair
ruled out of order. I do think that the reform
which was intended by the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs ought to be carried out, and if
the law now i'ails to accomplish it we ought
to make the law so that it wiil accomplish it.
If the Committee on Military AS'a'.rs have been
misled it is no fault of theirs, but it grew out
of the manner in which statements have been
made up and furnished to them. I submit
that the amendmentwhicli I offered ought not
to have been objected to, but ought to have
been adopted, so as to carry out practically
the reform which the committee designed.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Sir. DICKEY. I want to make a single
remark on this proposition, and that is, that
upon this single item of pay proper of the
Army there is a saving of $1,147,420 in this
appropriation bill over that of last year.
Mr. STEVENSON. That ought to settle
the question.
Mr. LOGAN. Now, if the gentleman will
allow me a moment, I can explain to him all
these certificates. I understand exactly how
they are made. And if you will call upon the
Paymaster General of the Army to make out
two pay-rolls, one under the law now and one
under the law as it formerly stood, you will
see the difference at once. What does the Pay-
master General of the Army mean by the pay-
roll? We are mustering out two hundred offi-
cers. By the bill which we passed last year we
provided that each officer who should resign
or be mustered out should receive a year's
extra pay. That is what the pay of the Army
means; that is what is referred to when it is
said that the pay of the Army has been in-
creased. In the discussion 011 that bill I
stated that the pay would be increased by
reason cf this one year's extra pay to the offi-
cers going out of the Army. Now that they
are mustered out, the question is whether the
pay of the Army will be increased or dimin-
ished by that law. As the gentleman says, the
amount required now for the pay of the Army
is $1,500,1100 less than was required last year.
[Here the hammer fell.]
The question was then taken oil the amend-
ment moved by Mr. Lawrence ; and it was
not agreed to.
41st Cong. 3d Sess.—No. 86.
t Received double rations under old system.
| The Clerk read as follows:
I For payment to discharged soldiers for clothing
; not drawn, $300,000.
I Mr. DICKEY. I move to strike out that
! paragraph, it having been included in the pre-
j ceding paragraph.
| Mr. JOHNSON. I rise to oppose the
! amendment; but I shall direct my remarks
entirely to another snbiect, with the indulgence
of the Committee of the Whole. A great deal
ox comment has been made here upon the
action of the Democratic Governor of the
State of California.
Mr. DICKEY. I must object to any further
discussion upon that subject.
Mr. JOHNSON. I hope the gentleman will
not object to my making a few remarks, as so
much has been said by others.
Mr. DICKEY. I must object.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair must sustain
the point of order.
Mr. JOHNSON. As a matter of course, the
point of order would be sustained if made.
The motion of Mr. Dickey to strike out the
paragraph was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
For extra pay to soldiers employed under the
direction of tbe quartermaster's department in tho
erection of barracks, store-house?, and hospitals, in
the construction of roads and other constant labor,
for periods of not less than ten days, under thft acts
of March 2,1819, and August4,1854, including those
employed as clerks at division anddepartmenthead-
quarters; expenses of expresses to and from the
trontier posts and armies iu the field; of escorts to
paymasters and other disbursing officers, and to
trains where military escorts cannot be furnished :
expanses of the interment of officers killed in action
or who die when on duty in the field or at posts on
.the frontiers, or at posts and other places when or-
dered by the Secretary of War, and of non-commis-
sioned officers n.iul s"ldiers; authorized office furni-
ture ; hire of laborers in the quartermaster's depart-
ment, including the hire of interpreters, spies, and \
guides for the Army: compensation of clerks to offi-
cers of the quartermaster's department; compensa-
tion of foraso and wagon masters, authorized by the
act of July 5,1838for the apprehension of deserters
jind the expenses incident to their pursuit; and for
tliu following expenditures required for the several
regiments ot cavalry, the batteries of light artillery,
and such companies of infantry as may be mounted,
namely: the purchase of travelitig forges, black-
smiths' and shoeing tools, horse and mule shoes and
nails, iron and stoel tor shoeing, hire of veterinary
surgeons, medio*ties for horses and mules, picket-
ropes. and for shoeing the horses of the corps named;
also, generally, the proper and authorized expenses
for the movement and operations of an army not
expressly assigned to any other department, $900,000.
Mr. SLOCUM. I move to insert after the
paragraph just read the following:
For laying pipe for supply of pure water to Gov-
ernor's Island in the harbor of New York, and for
the purchase of the necessary pipe, $20,000. if in the
judgment of the Secretary of War the expenditure
is advisable.
I offer that amendment after consultation
with the Secretary of War, who tells me that
water is now brought to the island in water-
boats, and that in his judgment this would be
a measure of economy. The matter would have
been brought to the attention of the Committee
on Appropriations had I obtained notice of it
earlier. The amendment is so worded as to
make it discretionary with the War Department
whether the expenditure shall be made or not.
I have consulted the chief engineer, and he
approves it.
Mr. DICKEY. This appropriation is not
included in the estimates; but if the Secretary
of War recommends it as a measure of economy
I will interpose no objection to it.
Tbe amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows :
For transportation of the Army, including bag-
gage of the troops when moving either by land or
water; ofclothiQg, camp and garrison equipage from
the depots of Pailadelphia and Jeffersotiville to the
several posts and Army depots, and from those de-
pots to the troops in the field; and of subsistence
stores from the places ofpurcbase, and from the places
of delivery under contract, to such places as thecir-
euuistances of the service may require them to be
sent; of ordnance, ordnance stores, and email arms
from the founderies and armories to the arsenals,
fortifications, frontier posts, and Army depots;
freights, wharfage, tolls, and ferriages; the purchase
and hire of horses, mules, oxen, and harness, and
the purchase and repair of wagons, carts, and drays,
and of ships and other sea-going vessels, and boats
required for the transportation of supplies and tor
garrison purposes; for drayage and cartage at tho
several posts, hire of teamsters, transportation of
funds for the pay and other disbursing departments,
the expense of sailing publio transports on the vari-
ous rivers, the Gait of Mexico, and the Atlantic
and Pacific; for procuring water at such posts as,
from their situation, require it to be brought from a
distance; and for clearing roads and removing ob-
structions from roads, harbors, and rivers to tho
extent which may be required for the actual opera-
tions of the troops in tbe field, $4,000,000.
Mr. HOLMAN. I move to amend the par-
agraph just read by adding to it the following:
No part of which shall be applied or expended in
the transportation of troops to be employed in any
manner whatever in connection with any election in
any State of the Union, unless called for by the
Governor of such Srate under the provisions of the
Constitution of the United States.
Mr. DICKEY. I raise a point of order ort
that amendment.
The CHAIRMAN. What is the point of
order?
Mr. HOLMAN. It is a limitation of the
appropriation.
Mr. DICKEY. Not only that, but it pro-
poses to direct the President what he shall do
with the military.
Mr. STEVENSON. In opposition to exist-
ing law.
Mr. DICKEY. Yes, in opposition to exist-
ing law.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair rules that
the amendment is not in order.
The Clerk read as follows:
For heating and cooking-stoves, $5,000.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I move to strike out
the clause just read. I make this motion for
the purpose merely of enabling me to correct
a statement made by ray friend from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Beck] a few moments since. He
said that the Government had sold arms to
foreign nations. 1 wish to say that on this
point he is entirely mistaken. This Govern-
ment has not sold arms to any foreign nation ;
it has not thus aided either party in the Euro-
pean conflict. But arms have been sold to
private parties, and if they were afterward
taken to foreign nations this Government could
know nothing about it and had no agency in
the matter.
Mr. DICKEY. The gentleman having gone
that far I must object to further debate, as the
question which he is discussing is not before
the committee.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Very well; I.have got
through all I wanted to say.
The CHAIRMAN. The remarks of the
gentleman from Ohio are notgermane to cook-
