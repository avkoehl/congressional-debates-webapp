General E. V. SUMNER,

Commanding Second Corps, Warrenton Junction:

By order of the President Blenker's division is to join General Fremont. I shall replace it by a division under General Mansfield.

The purpose of withdrawing the two divisions of your corps is to concentrate your corps in the field of active operations under your personal command. You will receive further instructions to-morrow. In the mean time please have Richardson's division ready to move back in the morning.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

WARRENTON JUNCTION, March 31, 1862-p.m.

Your telegram of 8.50 p.m. is received. Richardson's and Blenker's divisions are at this point, in bivouac. I had intended, under previous orders, to have sent on the arrival of General Abercrombie's to-morrow Blenker's division to Manassas Junction the day after.

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Corps.
