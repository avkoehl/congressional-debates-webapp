post at Houlton, to which no claim has yet been s<n up by
wm Bntaia   How soen it may be, under, tweh, ^oawsworw,
is yp to be seen The idea of a straight line from the monu
mont to the highlands, which maybe found conformable to the
treity, goes upon the ground that the point thus íeached would
be thsnoi hwest angle of Ssova. feco'ia, it can rest upon nothing
el^e And yet Great Butam does not c'aim it as such She
knows too well wherethe northwest angle of Nova Scotia ib to
<^e up suth ipre eneion The ground now talen by bei is,
that the line of the treaty is impiacticable , canno be rnn , is
\oid foi uncettainty, and that there is no northwest angle of
isova scotia If so, why need we concede her more than «he

an examination of these opinions and arguments, although it
would be an easy ?nl an muting task to show their u tei

them e westwardly to Connecticut river, so as to divide U\e
sources of the uveis flowing on either side of u TJiera-isno
d ifficulty in it at all The re is but one way to do it Men can-
noL differ about it That line gives you the soiuherii iymedary
of Lower Canada, or the Province of Quebec, as it was called
in the proclamation aal act of Parliament already referred to,
and, o course, it was the noi them boundary of Nova Scotia,
now New Brunswick, and also of Massachusetts Bay, bow
Maine This new boundary of Nova Scotia was expressly
recognised m 1767 and m 1771 in commissions granted to the
Governors of Nova Scotia, then appointed. The language id
both is—
•'Bounded on the westward by a line drawn from Cape Sable
across the entrance of the Bay of Fundy to the mouth of the ri-
ver St Croix, by the said river to its source, and by a line
drown, due north fi om thence to theboothern botjndaky of
our Province op Quebec ,j
We know where the southern boundary of Quebec is That
is beyond dispute A due north line, theiefore, from the St
Cioix to tl atsouthern boundary, gives the northwe&t angle of
Nova Scotia, and it can be nowheie else
Now the American ptoposition abandons this altogether,
an 1 ab indons all the evidence tmon which it res^s, and by con
sen ing many eient, to deviate from a due north line, it ad
puts what Great Britain so audaciously asserts, that there is
reai y no northwes1   angle   of Nova  Scotia, that the point
which the treaty of 1783 assumed to be so well known m for
e\ er to prevent dispute, is, m truth, nowhere to be found
1 he  proposition  is, that commissioners shall  go upon the
giound md, by ob ervation, by the eye, by exploration, deter
