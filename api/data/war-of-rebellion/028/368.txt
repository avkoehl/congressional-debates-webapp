Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The twenty regiments which I am now sending you, will leave, exclusive of the permanent garrisons, but three regiments on the lines of defense north of the Potomac and one which has just arrived, under Casey. General Casey is under orders from General Halleck to send two more regiments to Fort Monroe. These four regiments are the only troops disposable north of the Potomac without removing the garrisons. The troops on the other side consist of the Third and Eleventh Corps, Whipple's division, and the cavalry, besides the permanent garrisons of the works. Eight thousand of the troops to go to Frederick will get off to-day; all, I am informed, by to-morrow night. They are to go by railway to Frederick.
