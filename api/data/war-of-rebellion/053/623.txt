On Scott's approach they fell back to Sweet Water. Scott pursued as far as Philadelphia. No other Federals in neighborhood of Charleston. This is the force spoken of in former dispatch.

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.

Richmond, September 7, 1863.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

The President authorizes General Sam. Jones, lately ordered with re-enforcements toward East Tennessee, to use his discretion as to evacuation of Cumberland Gap. The order for its abandonment the President thinks probably founded on erroneous impression as to force of enemy threatening it and East Tennessee. From rather imperfect information it is believed to be small, a mere cavalry detachment. General Jones is advised if he can, to advance and clear the enemy from East Tennessee. Report if this interferes with your plans.*

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, September 7, 1863.

General S. JONES,

Abingdon, Va.:

Your command will extend as far over East Tennessee as circumstances will permit, and you will supply the temporary absence of General Buckner, suppressing tory organizations and holding the important positions.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.

Richmond, September 7, 1863.

General SAM. JONES,

Abingdon, Va.:

Generals Bragg and Buckner probably acted on misinformation as to force threatening. You have better information and must exercise fully your own judgment. The President advises you to push forward with strong force, and if enemy has, as is probable, only small detachment, you will probably be able to save the railroad and the valuable position of Cumberland Gap. Use your own discretion.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

ABINGDON, September 7, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

I omitted to mention in my telegram last night, as an additional reason why Cumberland Gap should not be evacuated at present,
