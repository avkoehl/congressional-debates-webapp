Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners:

Does the last declaration of exchanges cover officers or men belonging to the Navy? Those captured on the Hatteras for example.

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, May 15, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners:

Can provide for 2,000 paroled prisoners here and 5,000 at Annapolis. If more are delivered they must be sent to Fort Delaware. Get a list of wounded who remain at Richmond. Please answer.

W. HOFFMAN.

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, May 15, 1863

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDLOW,

Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners:

There are 1,100 rebel prisoners at Fort Delaware. Will be delivered when you send for them. About 500 prisoners of war and 200 citizens in the old Capitol for delivery.

W. HOFFMAN.

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

FORT MONROE, May 15, 1863

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have every reason to believe that the whole number of our officers and men captured at Fredericksburg and sent to Richmond will not exceed 4,500. There are very few wounded among them. Over 100 of our officers (General Hays among them and not wounded) arrived here this morning. Colonel Streight's command, captured in Georgia, have been received at City Point. I shall know to-morrow the exact number.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
