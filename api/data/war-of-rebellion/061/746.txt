reach the swamp which lay in our front, which they succeeded in doing, and by this means nearly all except the badly wounded were enabled to reach camp. Many wounded men belonging to the First Kansas Colored Volunteers fell into the hands of the enemy, and I have the most positive assurances from eye-witnesses that they were nurtured on the spot. The action was commenced at 10 a. m. and terminated at 2 p. m. I was forced to abandon everything to the enemy, and they thereby became possessed of this large train, two 6-pounder guns, and two 12-pounder mountain howitzers. With what force could be collected I made my way to this post, where I arrived at 11 p. m. of the same day.

At no time during the engagement, such was the nature of the ground and the size of the train, was I able to employ more than 500 men and two guns to repel the assaults of the enemy, whose force I estimate at 10,000 men and twelve guns, from the statements of prisoners. The columns of assault which were thrown against my front and right flank consisted of five regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, supported by a strong force which moved upon my left flank and rear. I have named this engagement the action of Poison Spring, from a spring of that name in the vicinity.

My loss during the engagement is as follows: Killed, 92; wounded, 97; missing, 106. Many of those reported missing are supposed to be killed. Others are supposed to be wounded and prisoners. The loss of the enemy is not know, but in my opinion it will much exceed our own.

The conduct of all the troops under my command, officers and men, was characterized by true soldierly bearing, and in no case was a line broken except when assaulted by an overwhelming force, and then falling back only when so ordered. The gallant dead, officers and men, all evinced the most heroics spirit, and died the death of true soldiers.

Very respectfully,

J. M. WILLIAMS,

Colonel First Kansas Colored Vols., Commanding Escort.

Captain WILLIAM S. WHITTEN,
