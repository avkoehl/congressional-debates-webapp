APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Cong—2nd Sess.
Trea*my Note Bill—Mr, Wise.
Jan. 1841
H. of Reps.
for a measure which he thought unconsUtatioaal,
for any paltry benefit to his own section, nor v/ouid
he, for any present benefit to his oiu particular
staple, recognise the protective principle which,
in its general operation, would infinitely counter-
vail the benefit ot a small increase of consumption
of cotton ]
Mr. Wise. I understood the gentleman not to
intend to vote for protection to co'ton in this sense,
bat I could not so well understand why the idea was
SO elaborated by him, and why cotton fabrics were
praised a* so much "prettier" than «tiles. I give
this principle of protection—'his pr > is.ion o' ih. 
fourteen sections pas^ tn the Señale last «-e^ion
to tax bleached and unbleached linen-, of Ru^a
and Scotland, in order to exclude ' burlaps," &r
from competition with American hemp—this old
and not odd idea of 1832 again revived at th s time,
when the cry is now only to tax Ivxunes—os an exam-
ple mtrely of the understanding of some gentleiren of
how the compromise art is fo b' earned out' Sir, it
only hhows that this thing oí carrying out this act
is a complex and intricate question—it is an edged
tool, and we of tne minority aie Ifadin  upon
burning ploughshares every step we take in taxing
luxuries. Tins mode of carrying out the compre-
mise—of not disturbing the rcmpiomise, has ma'e
me distrustful and diMnc ined to occ'i the sulj'ct
ol the tariff at all—has dt-teimined n- to meet the
attemptat the ihreshc-ld, to "take the I all .it die first
hop,"
Besides-, sir, ihecompiomneaot provide-! expns -
ly on what article-, the duties sh, II be l.nd p-iui to
June, 1842, in case of evcess or d"ficiency of rer-
uns. What are theyl See section G h of (he act,
which provides that,' m the contingency eithci (I
excess or deficiency of revenue " an act m-y by-
passed prior to the 30th day of Jt ne, IS 1-3, ' ?itir
ing the rates of dunes on articles wh ch, by the act
of 1832, are subject to a less rate of duly than 20
per centum ad valorem," m stub, miiuur  s • o'
to exceed ihat rati , and "so as loaclj ivt ihe reveim 
to eiiher of the said conitngcnciLS "
By the report ol the Secre ary aheady quot d—
page second—wesee also that ihe second limitation
of the compromise is that there chalí be no alttr>-
tion of dutiis prior to Jure, 1842, except upon the
articles named in this section—to wit, the articles
subject by the act of 1832 to a less rate of duty than
20 per centum ad valoren
What are those anielts? See the ac  of 1812
The list is too lung to quote, but many oí theoc ar-
ticles are of the ptotectei class, and if we t uth
silks and wines, what is tu prevent an inerea e ol
duties not exceedmg 20 per centum ad va'oiein on
tie who,e of these protected article"-' Did not the
resolution of inquiry proposed hy ihe ppntleman
from Vermont {Mr. Evs.rltt] point dintlly to
t%l7 I feared it did su,and, tr-eriftre, objected to
its reception
Again: The duties proposed even upon wines and
¡Alks and bleached and unbleached linens, &o in-
volve projection and the whole subject < f counter-
vailing duties, and viola'e ihe compron>ise act
The 4th section of the art provides etpro?sly
that "bleached and unbleached linens, tabic linen,
linen napkins, and linen cambaes, and worsted
stuff goods, shawls, and other manufactures of silk
and worsted, manufactures oí silk, cr of n'uci
silk shall be the component material oí < lutf \ ah e,
coming from this side of the Cape of Good Hope,
except sewing silk, shall, until the 30th oí June,
1842, be admitted to enter free Aoiii duty " Yet
the act of last session proposed to tax some oi
these very articles as high as 25, and even 50 per
cent.!
But, sir, I wish to examine a moment the subject
of duties on French wines and silks, especially a
connected with our staples of Macro and cotton.
On this subject, sir, I am for "iettibg well enough
alene." I do not know how n is with the pipe ami
segar tobacco of Maryland-—the bw- oot of my
friend, (Mr. Jenifer,) but the ol 1 J nr=5 riVir
weed, the chewing tobacco of Virginia, Í am told,
was never doing better. It never, upon the whole,
bore a better price as compared with otbe articles
of export, and our planters are doing too well to
enter upon a war of countervailing dutie ,
Which never yet ended m any thing else but recn-
mina ion, making bad, even where there was any
bad, wore  I want more light, Mr. Chairman,
than tUe Tobaxo Convention his yet Learned upon
this subject. Maryland may have cause to com-
plain, though I am 'old there are more than 70
millions of cigars imported into this couiury, and
ihe mo-it of them are not only manufae'ured oí our
tobacco, but are ac ually manufactured here and
exported to get the Havana stamp befo c they are
•50i(i—ihat the enhanced value of the cigars wi'l
justify fie exportation for importation again. How-
ever tins may be, and I d > not viuch for it, I hav
a fu'l sui ey of our whole trade with Frarce,
whit ii ought to be well ui derslood b-fjre we (am
per wi'h the cieli- " >-uKj  ot of eou tervailing du

s It may be objected that the idvaritages which the t tabular
jtsuits seem to show in Tavor of France ares i(i increased by
the nature ofthe exchanged pioduc ^, since thoot sent to France
consist   mostly of primitive materials while France  seno
*n letuta a large quantity of manuiactuied atticles But
uia im, ortant to no cc, according to the abo\e (able, that this
la^t cncumstancehas laigelycontributed to ensure to the Ame
ntan exportation itsanno«" constant and legular increase since
tw< uty yearis, th it the only decrease in the importation vva¡  in
H"1! that in 1837, it was 33 per cent larget than the French
exportation, and that, from 1825 to 1833, it mcieased ftom 41
millions to 101, increase equal to 146 3 per cent
'During that time, the Fiench eipoitb have been submitted
tithe most abrupt variations, as well in increase asindecieaae
Ftom lS32to J833, it went lorn 58 rml'mns up to 107, to fall
backagdin, m 1&37, from 158 milbons to 5^ The 15S millions
to which it amounted in 1836 and the 120 in 18-38 but paiucu
larly the firs!, may be considered ag unusual, being to a gieit
dciee the result of the extraordmaiy impure given to the
commercial mterrourse with Lmope hy the e^ialhshment of
ocd! banks m he 'UTerent ^tatf *? oi theT^uion, and the facility
they aliorded to the commerce to get rid of iheirown paper
And thi- iii)[ uise may heconsideiea a^ the «nnue of all the los

u usual exfoit3t!un And at the piesent time ¡ike in }P3",
the reaction of tin- <?ys urn, a^ain felt m 'he United States, will
cieate and haa alrt.a ¡y created, a notable reducaon in their im
portation from Trance for l-,f) and 1840 Is ot withstanding these
obseivaiions if we take as i regular term of comparison the
amountof 1 tench expori^ foi 18JS, wesee that, =ince 1825to
the present moment, it has only bt,en incieased fiom 94 millions
to 120, that !<*, 2d pei cent
