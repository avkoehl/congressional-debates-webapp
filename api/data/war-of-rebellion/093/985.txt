HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, November 22, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Pulaski:

The guerrillas got at the Northwestern railroad yesterday morning and destroyed a train sent for Ruger, which has detained his brigade. He expects to be here by 4 p.m. Did General Wilson reach Pulaski to-day? Upon inquiry I learn that there are three crossings of Duck River below Columbia, viz, at Williamsport, Gordon's Ferry, and at Centerville; at all of them the ground at the north side commands. I will give Ruger instructions to occupy the north bank at all three places.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

PULASKI, November 22, 1864-4.50 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have just received General Hatch's report of 10 a.m. to-day, a copy of which has been forwarded to you.* I think Hood has probably developed his plans to-day, and I will know by morning. Train has just arrived. General Wilson has not come, so far as as I can learn.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LYNVILLE, November 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Commanding Second Division, Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: My command is encamped on the north and west sides of the place. If you will take the south side as you approach, covering the hills southwest of the village and occupying also the old works on the east, it will made a good arrangement of camps and a good position for mutual support.

Yours,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

While he is loath to lose you as comrades in the great cause for which we are battling, he feels that you have faithfully filled the contract made with your Government three years ago, and is glad to see you now enjoy that pleasure, so well merited, of returning once more to your friends at home. He congratulates you on establishing
