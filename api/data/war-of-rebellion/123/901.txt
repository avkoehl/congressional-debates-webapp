under command of Major-General John Pope. The Indian hostilities have been suppressed and further trouble from that source is not apprehended. Such force as may be deemed requisite by the military authorities will be held in readiness for any sudden necessity. The Indian hostilities in Minnesota, by whomsoever instigated, seem to have been accompanied with more than usual cruelty and outrage. Heavy losses in property are said to have been endured by the inhabitants, and application has been made to this Department for compensation. As it has no funds applicable to that purpose, nor authority to assess the damages, the subject will require Congressional action. Three hundred captured Indians have been tried by court-martial, and their sentence of death is now under your consideration.

The rebels under Sibley were driven from the Department of New Mexico by General Canby, and the force in that department, now under command of General Carleton, will be able to protect the inhabitants of that remote Territory.

The Department of the Pacific has been free from any of the calamities occasioned by the rebellion; but an earnest and deep sympathy has been manifested by the loyal citizens of the Pacific States in support of the Union cause. Volunteers have come forward to fill the ranks of the Army, and, with unparalleled liberality, large sums of money have been transmitted by humane and loyal citizens of California for the relief of our sick and wounded soldiers. The patriotic loyalty of our brethren on the Pacific, thus humanely exhibited, evinces their estimate of the value of the Union and their willingness to share the burden of maintaining it from sea to sea.

In the Department of the Ohio the invasion of Kentucky by General Bragg, the terrible battle of Perryville, and the escape of Bragg's army were events that pressed heavily upon the Government, and moved deeply the hearts of the people, especially in the Western States. These events are about to undergo investigation, and when the causes to which they are attributable are judicially ascertained they will be laid before you for your action. Recent events prove that whatever hold the spirit of rebellion may once have had in Kentucky, it is now to be reckoned as a State loyal and steadfast to the Union.

The Department of the Tennessee is now under command of Major- General Grant. The principal operations in that department have already been alluded to and are detailed in the report of the General-in-Chief.* Their importance cannot be overestimated. The occupation of Memphis - next to New Orleans the principal mart on the Mississippi - and the wise and vigorous measures of Major- General Sherman, commanding there, have opened a market for cotton and other Southern products the beneficial effects of which are already felt in the reviving commerce of the country.

The Department of the Cumberland, embracing that portion of the State of Tennessee east of the Tennessee River and the Cumberland Gap, was placed, upon the removal of General Buell, in command of Major-General Rosecrans. Having a well-disciplined and gallant army under his command, a proper degree of diligence and activity cannot fail to exercise an important influence upon the speedy termination of the war.

From a survey of the whole field of operations, it is apparent that whatever disasters our arms may have suffered at particular points,
