the nation, purchase blood horses and jacks, and
bring them home and sell them at public auction
and divide the proceeds of the adventure among
the States If, sir, you can do this, can you not
establish a Treasury note bank, or a bank with
$50,000,000 capital, and divide it among theStates
and distribute its dividends5 Is there, sir, any
distinction between taking the money out of the
lieasuiy and pui chasing lands and dividing their
proceeds, and taking the same amount for the
purchase of stocks and banks and dividing their
pioceeds ? If there is, I acknowledge very frankly
ray utter inability to appreciate or understand a
particle of diffeience between the two proposi-
tions. And, sir, I am at a loss to understand Aojo
the gentleman fi om Virginia, who is a strict con-
structionist and a lawyer of distinguished preem-
inence, can possibly bring his mind to the con-
clusion he has adopted. I am perfectly assured
he is candid in taking the ground he has assumed,
and I can only account for the singularity of his
dogmas by supposing that he is exceedingly anx-
ious to get a little money out of the public crib
for the "good old Dominion."
Mr. Speaker, we are often told that much more
has been done for the new States than for the
old Sir, I deny and controvert the fact, and
boldly declaie that the new States have been im-
posed upon. Restrictions and onerous obligations
were placed on us as a condition before we could
be admitted into the Union; and those restric-
tions and lmpedimentsliave originated a scheme
for keeping up a heavy taxation upon personal
propelty in the new States, and yet, sir, we have
not had the privilege of taxing the public domain
within our holders. Had we that privilege, and
could we tax the property of the General Gov-
ernment as we do that of our own citizens, we
should have an oveiflowing State treasury—a
treasury, sir, that would enable us to cany out
our systems of education and internal improve-
ment.
I will take my own State, Mr Speaker, and
base upon it the grounds that I assume Aikan-
sas was admitted into the Union three years
since. Since her admission she has received from
the Government by appropriations about one hun-
dred thousand dollars, which sum was expended
in improving the navigable wateis of our com-
mon country, for our nveis, sn, like our roads,
aie open to all, have conferred, in a tenfold de-
gree, more benefits on the great body of the
American people than on the immediate popula-
tion of Arkansas These rivers have been im-
proved, and you have used them to transport
troops and munitions of war and piovisions to
your outposts, Fort Gibson and Tort Smith, on
the Arkansas, and to other important points on
the southwestern and western border. Without
these impiovements, the demand and the price of
supplies for your Army would have been aug-
mented to the rate of one hundred per centum
What would have been the taxes of the State,
provided we had taxed the lands of the Govern
ment at the present late of taxation imposed on
the people ofAikansas for the support of her
government' That rate is about one cent the
acre, including State and county taxation ' From
House document No. 46, covering a report and
estimate from the Commissioner of Public Lands,
we find that there yet remain within the limits of
Aikansas twenty eight million two hundred and
sixty thousand seven hundred and forty-three
acres of land yet unsold, after deducting grants
and donations to the State and individuals.
Suppose, sn, we weie permitted to tax that
land at the moderate sum of one cent the acie, the
gioss amount would be swelled to the round sum
of §280,607. And if we had taxed these lands at
that late for tht last three years, oi from the day
of oui admission to the Union, we should have
diawn fiom your Treasury the sum of $841,811,
an amount nearly equaling the amount the State
and Terrtory have leceived since their establish-
ment1 And yet you deny my State the pooi
p ttance necessary to establish roads within her
boundaries
Fiom the same document, to which I have
made rffeience, I find that, in all the new States
and Territories, there remains unsold the gross
amount of t\v o hundred and twenty nine million
seven hundred and eleven thousand and seventy-
five acres, which, at the veiy moderate rate of tax-
ation of one cent the acre, if taxed, would yield
the sum total of #2,297,100 ' Some of the new
States have been in the Union nearly forty years.
I will, however, make an average of twenty years
oftaxationattherate I have previously spoken of,
and, in that period, the taxation would amount to
#47,940,000 ' As an equivalent for the denial of
the nghtto tax the public domain, thenewStates
and Tenitones have received—
For satines    ..............................329,600 acres
For common schools.....................9,385,000   "
For various other purposes................3,385,000   "
Total................................12,770,000   "
Money received for two per cent fund for roads leading to
the States, to be expended under the direction of Con-
gress    .................$1,456,000
Tor three per cent fund to he paid to each State
for the construction of roads within the same,  2,1S4,000
For five per cent fund paid for construction of
roads within the States   ..............     326,700
Total    ...............................83,966,700
Within the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illi-
nois, we have sixty-six million acres of public
lands, which would yield, if taxed at one cent
the acre, about double the amount now proposed
to be expended in the opening of the Cumberland
road, and yet wp are told that the new States are
receiving morp than then proportion of the public
money1 Hereafter, I shall advise gentlemen to
look to the expendituies in their own States,and
bear in mind that the old thirteen States owned
and received all the benefits denvable from the
Crown lands which lay within their limits, after
the revolutionary war, and let them recollect that
not one dollar, derived from the sale of them,
ever reached the thirteen new States.
One would think, Mr Speakei, after the com-
pact with the State of Tennessee, in the year
1806-07, that that State was and is bound to pay
and satisfy all the Noith Carolina land warrants
Under that compact the General Government
donated to Tennessee, for colleges and academies,
two hundred thousand acres, and besides this,
the Government was to set apait for common
schools the sixteenth section of each township
embraced in the whole of that section of country
lying north and east of the congressional resei va-
tion line, which would have given the State one
hundied and seventy thousand acres, instead of
the twenty-five thousand acres actually received,
leaving unsatisfiedanddue the State one hundied
and thirty-five thousand acres. But even that is
denied her' And the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr Robertsov,] says that injustice would be
done to the sutlers by compelling them to remain
on the poor refuse lands, and offers the asset tion
as an aigumcnt to prove that the lands should not
be ceded' If the gentleman is cand.d in his po-
sition, then why refuse to relinquish to the State
of Tennessee and to the other States the refuse
lands > Why desire to hold on, and sell them at
high prices, to divide among the States, when he
admits that it is an injury to the settlers to suffer
them to remain on them without price ? Avarice,
I fear, is a controlling passion, and it is that, sir,
which withholds from these States and fiom the
people lands which the gentleman fiom Virginia
admits are not fit for cultivation.
Mr Speaker, the spirit of avarice and plunder
seems now the oider of the day, the trials and
misfortunes of the poor, who have sought a re-
treat in the forests of your western wilds, amidst
the dangers of climate and the red man, have no
place in the hearts of American statesmen. That
band of patriotic citizens which have emigrated
and settled your wild domain, who opened your
roads, and, by then valor, defended your fron-
tier, and who are bound together by new ties as
society increases, have been left to contend against
a herd of speciiíníors to secure their ownjust rights,
and aie now, by this resolution, to be broughtm
contact with the greedy and voiacious States, in-
stead of the heartless speculatoi
Mr Speaker, I have now offered all the argu-
ments that I intend to present in support of the
position that Congress has no powei, under the
Constitution, to raise money fiom any wmce for
the purpose of dividing it among the States-, ana
I will now proceed to offer my objections to the
passage of the resolution upon the ground of in-
expediency. Sn, as a matter of interest and ex-
pediency, I protest against it The state of the
nat.onal Tieasuiy will not justify it, and, under
the present situation of the tariff, the ievenue must
giadually decrpase until the expiration of the
compiomise act, m the yea' 1842, at which pe-
nod the revenue will sink to about twelve oi thn-
teen millions, thus producing a probable and sup-
posable deficiency in the Tieasmy of money, ex-
clusive of the sales of public lands, of some eight
or twelve millions I need not say that mci eased
duties will follow to supply that deficiency, and,
until the country is prepared to suffer itself to be
burdened with a high tauff, for the benefit of
eastern manufacturers, will it submit to the pro-
visions of the resolution of the gentleman from
Vnginia? Sir, my people more especially íefuse
to submit to a tauff of some fifty or one hundred
per cent., the buiden of which must (as all im-
ports ever do and ever must) fall on the consum-
ers; and at least two thirds of such a tariff would
fall upon the new States, whose citizens will be
required, individually, to pay the increased tauff.
In this place I take much pleasure in presenting
to the House the views of the late President of the
United States, General Jackson, who, as a states-
man has had no superior, and whose arguments
in his celebrated veto message on Mr. Clay's land
bill aie so conclusive as to leave not a doubt on
the mind of any man, who is not blinded by pas-
sion or partisanship, as to the impolicy and un-
constitutionality of the distributive system. Thua
argued the late Piesident
11 Cut this lull assumes a new principle Its object is not
to return to the people an unavoidable surplus ot revenu 
paid in by them, but to create a surplus for dlstiibutiofl
among tht States It seizes the entire proceeds 01 oni
source o, revenue, and sets them apartas a surplus making
it necessary to raise the inonev s for supporting the Govern
I ment, and meeting the general charges, irom other souices
It even throws the enure land system upon the customs loi
its suppoit, and makes the public lands a perpetual thargi
upon the 1 reasury It does not return to the people mon-
eys accidentally or unavoidably paid b\ tlitin to the Gov
eminent, by winch they are not wanted , but compels tha
people to pay moneys into the Treasury for the mere pur-
pose of creating a surplus for distribution to their State gov
ernments If tins principle be once admitted, it is not diffi-
cult to perceive to what consequent! s it ma) lead Already
tins bill, by throwing the land system on the revenues fiom
imports lor suppoit, virtually distributes among the States
a part of those revenues 'I he proportion m ly be increased
from time to time, without any departure fiom the principia
now asserted, until the State government shall derive all
funds necessary for their support from the Treasuiy of the
United Slates Or, if a sufficient supply should be obtained
by some Mates and not by others, the deficient States might
complain, and, to put an end to all further difficulty, Con-
gress, without assuming any new principle, need go 1 ut one
step further, and put the salaries of all the State Governors,
judges, and other officers, with a sufhcient sum for other
expenses, in their general appropnation bill
" It appears to me that a more direct road to consolida
tion cannot be devised Money is pow er, and in that power,
which pa>s all the public officers of the States will all
political power be substantially concentrated The fetate
governments, if governments they might be called, would
lose oil their independence and digintj The economy
winch now distinguishes them would be converted into a
profusion, limited only by tin extent of the supply Being
the dependants 01 the General Government, and looking to
its 1 reasury as the source of all their emoluments, the Snte
officers under whatever names they might piss, and by
whatever forms their duties might be prescribed, would, in
effect, be the mere stipendiaiies and instruments of the
central powtr "
And again, the same enlightened statesman
remarked:
" I deceive myself greatly if the new States would find
their interests promoted by such a sjstem as this bill pio
poses Their true policy consists in the rapid settling and
improvement of the waste lands within their limits As a
means of hastening those events, they have long been look
ing to a reduction in the price of public lands upon the
final pajment of the national debt The effect of the pro
posed system would be to prevent lint reduction It is
true the bill reserves to Congress the power to reduce the
price, but the effect of its details, as now arranged, would
probably be forever to prevent its exercise "
The message fiom which I have read these
extracts was so able, so conclusive, th it it u as
not only sustained by Congiess, but by an over-
whelming majonty of the American people It
demonstiates, beyond the shadow of a doubt,
that the system of distribution is not only im-
politic, unjust, unequal, but that it is unconstn'-
tional.
