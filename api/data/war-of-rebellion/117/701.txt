other side is an abstract of the regiments, officers, and number in each, showing at a glance the number of available men to be immediately thrown into the service whenever an exchange is effected. We have in the State besides these a very considerable number who are being hunted up and brought to camp with a view to reporting them for exchange.

Very respectfully,

LAZ. NOBLE,

Adjutant-General of Indiana.

HEADQUARTERS, Camp Chase, November 11, 1862.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.

COLONEL: Yours of the 7th instant came duly to hand and contents noted. The distinction drawn in your letter of instruction of 22nd September between Confederate prisoners of war and irregulars is specific and I believe is correctly comprehended by me. In the specific cases to which I called your attention my understanding was that the prisoners were Confederate prisoners of war for exchange unless they were willing to take the oath of allegiance, and without any promise to release them they declared their willingness to take the oath. The minors and those sick I discharged on taking the oath--perhaps twenty in all.

The sending of these men from Kentucky to this post when it would have been so much less expensive to have sent them direct to Cairo, the fact of their being nearly all Kentuckians, many of them living in neighborhoods infested with guerrilla parties, together with the instructions of the Secretary of War that such only were to be released as would evidently respect their oaths, and Governor Tod's approbation
