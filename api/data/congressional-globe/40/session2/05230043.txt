APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
43
40th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
The subject of connecting the telegraphic
system of the country with the postal service
has attracted public attention, and it received,
to some extent, the consideration of my pre-
decessor. It has recently transpired that the
telegraphic system of Great Britain has been
put in charge of the British post office depart-
ment. It is a matter of very great importance,
and its propriety and practicability ought to be
thoroughly investigated by Congress. The
most efficient mode of examination of the
subject, in my judgment, would be the appoint-
ment of a special commission to inquire into
the working of a new arrangement in Great
Britain, and into its feasibility in the United
States, and report to Congress for such action
as may be wisely taken.
I am compelled again to call attention to
the gross frauds perpetrated upon the Depart-
ment by violations of the fratiking'privilege
in almost all parts of the country. The fac
simile franks of different members of Congress
are freely used to circulate obscene books and
papers, lottery circulars, business cards, &c.,
and to cover all kinds of business and domes-
tic correspondence of persons not authorized
by law to frank mailable matter. Unless
something is done speedily by Congress to
check this serious mischief, the annual appro-
priation to cover the transmission of free matter
will have to be increased from $700,000 to at
least $1,000,000. To avoid the continuance of
this serious abuse in the use of the names of
members of Congress without their knowledge
or consent I again urge that the law be so
changed as to require the written signature of
the person exercising the franking privilege
upon the matter franked; and, to relieve the
heads of Departments and Bureaus of great
labor, that a franking clerk be authorized by
law for each Department, of the Government,
with the authority to frank all matter pertain-
ing to the Department for which he is so
appointed.
The commercial enterprises of the people
of the United States are carried on to a very
large extent by the use of foreign ships. The
oeean mail service also is performed to a very
great extent by foreign ships. The commer-
cial and postal interests of the country ought
to be made aids to each other. We are too
dependent upon the enterprises of other peo-
ples in the transaction of our business. Some
encouragement ought to be given in some way
to our own ship-builders and citizens engaged
in ocean commerce to build ships and buy
ships and own ships, to be used in our own
business. It is to be hoped that Congress will
relieve labor and ship-building materials of
taxes and impositions, so that our own ships
may be built in our own waters, to bear our
commerce and carry our mails. As long as
subsidies are paid by other Governments to
aid in establishing and maintaining lines of
ocean steamers to and from European ports,
giving them the command of the carrying trade,
with comparatively little competition, it is due
to the citizens of the United States that like aid
should be furnished to American enterprise.
This can, in my judgment, be very properly
and profitably done by subsidies to lines of
steamers already established, or to be estab-
lished, as a consideration for carrying the
ocean mails.
Respectfully submitted.
ALEXANDER W. RANDALL,
Postmaster General.
The President.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Department op the Interim!,
Washington, November 18, 1807.
Sib : I have the honor to submit a summary
of the results which were attained during the last
fiscal year, in the branches of the public service
committed to the supel vision ot this Depart-
ment. The accompanying reports of the chiefs
of bureaus and other officers furnish that
specific information on matters of detail which
could not be embraced in this paper without
unduly extending its limits.
None of these branches occupies a higher
place in the public regard than that which
relates to the national domain. Much of this
noble patrimony was acquired by cession from
the States which won our independence. Suc-
cessive additions to it have been made by
treaties, the first of which was concluded with
France in 1800, and the last with Russia, ceding
to us her American possessions, which cover
an area of 309,529,000 acres.
Our legislation has been adapted to_ the
peculiar status of the territory acquired from
foreign Powers and to the adjudication of indi-
vidual rights claimed under them. Experi-
ence has suggested salutary changes in the
mode of disposing of the public lands. Credit
on sales has been long since abolished. The
right of preemption, originally conferred only
by special enactment, has become a perma-
nent part of our system. At a later period
the homestead policy was ingrafted upon it.
In no respect has the wisdom of Congress been
more strikingly displayed than in the adoption
of a general and uniform method of public
surveys. Until they are extended over the
soil, the proprietorship thereof remains in the
Government. This policy offers a marked
contrast to that of the nations which estab-
lished colonies within our limits, and secures
to the purchaser an indisputable right to a
well-defined tract. Notwithstanding our set-
tlements have progressed with a rapidity un-
equaled in the history of nations, few serious
controversies have arisen in regard to titles
emanating from the United States. Our pres-
ent system is so simple and efficient, so well
adapted to the wants of our population and
the interests of the service, that it is not sus-
ceptible of much improvement. Such modi-
fications as were needed to perfect it were
alluded to in my last annual report. No
necessity exists for making at this time more
special reference to them.
During the fiscal year 7,041,114.50 acres
were disposed of, as follows:
Arret.
Sold for ca^h 
Located with military warrants  4/b /bO.Oil
Taken for homesteads 
Approved to States as swamp  I,0otj, 0.l3
Grants to inilroads, wagon roads, and
canals  i-i, /-jr-"?
Located with college scrip  2,-120,0fZ.tS
Total 7,041,114.50
This quantity exceeds that disposed of dur-
the previous year by 2,111,800 acres.
The cash receipts of the office from sales
and fees of various kinds amounted to $1,347,-
862 52; a sum greater than that received the
previous year by more than half a million
dollars.
During the last fiscal year and the quarter
of the present year ending 30th September last,
550 Indian patents were issued, embracing
89,824 acres.
Under the several acts of Congress relating
thereto, 275 patents for private land claims in
California have been issued, embracing4,303,-
300 acres.
Contracts have been entered into for sur-
veying and marking the northern boundary of j
California, that portion of the eastern boundary
of Oregon which lies due south of the conflu-
ence of Owyhee with Snake river, to the north-
ern line of Nevada, and the northern boundary
of New Mexico. It is recommended that appro-
priations be made for the survey of the north-
ern and eastern boundaries of Colorado Terri-
tory and the northern and eastern boundaries
of Nevada.
The report of tlie Commissioner evinces great
labor and research. He discusses with his
accustomed ability many questions in connec-
tion with the landed interests of the United
States.
The last soldier of the Revolution who was
on the pension-rolls at the date of my last annual
report has since died. By special act of Con-
gress two other veterans of that war have been
placed on the rolls at the rate of $500 per
annum. Of the widows of such soldiers there
are on the rolls the names of 997 ; of these 119
were married prior to 1st January, 1800.
Of wars subsequent to the Revolution and
prior to the rebellion the number of pensioned
widows and orphans of soldiers was 1,310 at
the close of the last fiscal year.
During the past year, 16,452 new applications
for invalid pensions of soldiers,at an aggregate
annual rate of $1,180,194 72, and 13,940 ap-
plications for increased pension of invalid
soldiers, at an aggregate annual rate of
$1,089,003 02, have been examined and al-
lowed. During the same period 19,600 original
applications for pension by widows, orphans,
and dependent relatives of soldiers were ad-
mitted, at an aggregate annual rate of $1,979,-
062 07. Of applications for increased pay
by the same class, 19,309 were admitted, at a
total annual rate of $1,150,640. On the 80th
June, 1867, there were enrolled 70,802 invalid
military pensioners, whose yearly pensions
amounted to $0,478,004 14, and82,291 widows,
orphans, and dependent relatives of soldiers,
whose yearly pensions amounted to $9,064,-
075 83, making the total aggregate of Army
pensions 153,093, at a total annual rate of
$16,142,079 <J7.
The whole amount paid during the last
fiscal year to invalid military pensioners was
$0,428,532 58; to widows, orphans, and de-
pendent relatives, $11,873,182 72; a grand
total of $18,301,715 26, which includes the
expenses of the disbursing agencies.
During the year ending June 30, 1867, there
were admitted 137 new applications for invalid
Navy pensions, at an annual rate of $10,317 ;
206 applications for increased pensions of the
same class at an annual aggregate of $17,892 ;
233 original applications of widows, orphans,
and dependent relatives of those who died in
the Navy, at an aggregate rate of $31,856 per
annum, and 120 pensions of the same class
were increased at a total yearly rate of $0,792.
On the 30th June, 1807, on the rolls of the
Navy pensioners were the names of 1,054 in-
valids, at an annual aggregate of $89,652 25,
and 1,327 widows, orphans, and dependent rel-
atives, at an aggregate annual rate of $305,-
742 25. The amount paid during the last fiscal
year to Navy invalids was $77,241 2S, and to
widows, orphans, and dependent relatives of
officers and seamen of the Navy $240,999 92:
a total amount of $318,241 20.
During the year there were added to the
number of pensioners of all classes 36,482;
there were 7,932 dropped from various causes,
leaving on the rolls June 30, 1867, 155,474.
The total annual amount, of pensions of all
classes was $16 449,822 22, and the amount
paid was $18,619,956 46, which includes ex-
penses of disbursement.
During the year ending September 30, 1807,
there were admitted 954 applications for bounty
land warrants, requiring 148,963 acres of land
to satisfy them.
The invested Navy pension fund now amounts
to $13,000,000, and there is an uninvested bal-
ance ot' $229,216 37. As the interest on the
invested sum far exceeds the amount required
for the Navy pensions, Congress provided, by
act approved March 2, 1867. for tin1 increase
of the pensions of meritorious disabled officers,
seamen, and marines. The Secretary of the
Navy has favorably reported seven claims or
this class. There is an urgent necessity for an
increased appropriation for special investiga-
tion to prevent frauds upon the Government
in obtaining pensions. The amount saved to
the Government by such investigations lias Ur
exceeded the expenditures m conducting them,
