"When tbi« partv s^all have found a tract of country suit
mg the emigrant0, and not claimed by other Indiana, we will
arrange with them and you the exch-ng  of that for a jti«t
poition of the country they ]ea\e,and to a part of which, pro
p irtioned to then numbers they have a right Every aid
ovvante their removil, and what wilt he necessary for them
there, will then be freely adrnimsteied tothem, and when esta
bli&hed in their new settlements, weshail still consider them
as our chiUrcn, give them the benefit of exchanging their
perries for what they will want at our factories, and always
•told them fi-mly by the hand
And wheieas the Cheiot-ees relying on the promises of the Pre-
sident of the United States, as above recited, did explore the
country on the west side of the Mi^iss ppi. and made choice of
the country on the Arkansas and White rivers, and settled
themselves down upon the TTn ted btates lands, to which no
other tribe of Indians have an) just claim, and have du1} not!
fied the President of the United States thereof and of their
anxious des re for ihe full and complete ratification of his
promi c, and to that end, as notified bv the President of the
United states have sent on their agents with full powers to
execute a treaty íe tuqulshing to the Unlxd States all the
i^hi, ti le, ind interest t > alllaniU ofrishtto them belonging, as
pan of the rhcrokee nation, which they have left, and which
thev a-e about to ieive, proportioned tc ihPAr numhers in
eluding, with thos" now on the Aikans^s, those who are about
to lemovc thither, and to a poition of which they have an
equal right agreeably to their number?
The "lower towns," who thus made known
their desire, in the year 1808, to continue the hun-
ter-life, and also the scarcity of ?ame where they
then lived, and their wish, under those circum-
stances, to remove across the Mississippi river, on
some vacant land of the United S ates, were chiefly
that portion of the Cheroitee tribe who were in
the occupancy of the lands which the United States
were to obtain for Georgia Notwithstanding this
disposition of the Indians to surrender their lands
as early as 1808, the Unfed Slates did not embrace
it, bu', on the contrary, abandoned her duty, and
made no effort to obtain the land until this treaty
of 1817, wich extinguished the occupant right of
the Cherokee Indians to nearlv all the lands con-
templated bv ti e comp ict of 1802 Georgia now
thought her just r s>b.!s were secured, and that soon
her forests vv ou'd becos"  fields, and her popula-
tion increase. ¡No"* ithstandmg these just expecta-
tions, this treaty of 1817, against which no al ega-
tion had been made of fraud or injustice, unless it
was considered a fraud in the United States to
comply with her contract, and to have done an act
of justice to Georgia,-was, by articles of conven-
tion made between John C Calhoun, Secretary of
War, ben g specially authorized therefor by the
Presideni of the United States, and the chiefs and
headmen of the Cherokee nation ol Indians, duly
authori7ed and empowered bv sain nation, at the
city of Washington, on the 27th February, 1819,
readjusted, and, so far as the interest of Georgia
was involved, measurably abrogaied, and, on its
very face, vntuallv declared that the United States
did not intend to comply with the articles which she
was solemnly pledged to fulfil. Sir, let me read to
the committee the preamble of this treatv

I am thus partienbr, Mr Chairn an, to show the
treatment Georgia has ec iv ed, to present m the
people of the Union the injustice she has suffered,
the patience she has exhibited, the christian for-
bearance which has marked her submission amidst
the embarrassing difficulties and djsappoiatmenis
which this Government caused by its fiegted of
solemn engagements. Remember, m 1817 obt
rights were partially regarded, and our territory ob-
tained. In 1819 our rights divested, our prospects
blighted; the Indians, instead of being removed,
were arranging for permanently remaining, and
this Government approving these arrangements;
and if Georgia utters a complaint, files a protest,
or uses that " ultimata ratio" of some politicians,
remonstrance, she is charged with violence, cruelty,
and hatred to the Indians. Such conduct is insult-
ing to the feelings of every Georgian, disreputable
to the General Government. We have paid mil-
lions for the mere obligation to extinguish the In-
dian titles. Look at the sales of public lands m
the States of Alabama and Mississippi You have
received the proceeds, and how have you compen-
sated Georgia for all thi*1 Have you discharged
your obligations? have you acted in good faith1?
No, sir, to vindicate yourself as a Government,
and as an obligor, you have slandered your credi-
tor; when she has requested payment, you speak
of her importunities Sir, the whole conduct of
this Government towards Georgia, on this transac-
tion, has been faithless and dilatory. Why has tt
been so' Mere avarice; a desire to obtain for her-
self—to procure millions, for her own use, by ne-
glect of her obligations to us.
To add to all this, in making this treaty of 1819
and others, you violate the compact, by placing it
ou* of the power of the Government to discharge
it, you guaranty in fee simple six hundred and
forty acres to each head of an Indian family who
reside vithin the ceded terntery, who choose to be-
come citizens ot the United S'a'es, &c. Is this
extinguish ng ihe Indian occupant rights fcr the
use of Georgia' l\o, sir, tor the use 01 the Indian
—he or she i  to have the absolute fee, and the
consequent right of individual alienation or sale
to whom he or she pleases And yet, we are told,
Georgia is too clamorous.
Mr. Chairman, I ask of gentlemen who hav e so
frequently eipressed themselyes unkindly, if they
are not convinced of tbs mjastice of their censure?
In 1808, the Cherokees m GeeTgia ' tie an? cms
for a treat), the Government, ¡1 n r- w, s < >
much involved in foreign diificou <*o and c , ,c.
to attend to such mailers «e did nc < r pt

and sacrifices freely encru^tf-red,  i 1 by 'o S > e
more free!) than by Georgia Peace was res ured;
unusual prosper ) sprung up, the Government
was basking in a glorious sunshine, and Georgia,
who had conttibuted her share in the struggle, and
severel) earaed her proportion of the fame, asked
once more, in 1816, that the compact of 1802
should be executed. Her request was responded
to, and she saw, as she supposed, an end of this
exciting controversy Bu', unfortunately, she was
mistaken, soon -he heard of local jealousies—Ca-
rolina and Georgia feeling, the great men to wh'ch
the war had given b rth began to aspire, individu-
al jealously commenced lakmg root, "infles light
as air"' soon increased the flame into a blaze the
end of all this has been an injury to the entire
South. We then heard of the duty the Gov em-
inent owed 'o itself to prepare for the pavmert ol
the public debt .ncurred b> the war, it was a pa-
triotic object, and a praisen orth) suggestion, and
should ba\ e been done, but not at the expense of
the faith of the General Gove nment to Georgia
To disencumber the Government of her debt,staxes
had been mcrasased by the tar.ff of 1816, lands
«ere obtained for ihe purpose of sale, so that the
proceeds might go into the treasury of the Union.
The treaty oí 1817 obtained lands for Georgia, for
which the General Government had to expend, not
recite, hence the modifications of the treaty of
1817 by the one made at Washington city, 1819,
by which Georgia lost her right*, and ihe rich and
fertile lands of Tennessee and Alabama weie *b-
tained, sold, and the proceeds applied, in payment
