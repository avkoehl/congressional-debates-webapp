Bvt. Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding the corps directs me to any that parties have been sent out by Generals Mott and hays with a view to finding the entrenched picket-line of the enemy and securing it. General Hays is ordered to go to Dabney's Mill. General Humphreys wishes you to send out a party of, say, about 300 men from your front with the same object, viz, to ascertain where the picket-line of the enemy is; obtain possession of it.

Very respectfully,

C. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel C. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

COLONEL: The Fifth Corps has advanced its line of battle about 1,000 yards. It is now at the Friends Meeting-house. Its picket-line is advanced still farther (about 800 yards). I have sent out 300 men to drive in the enemy's pickets, and have also ordered my picket-line forward some 500 yards. Men have been sent to extend my picket-line to the left so as to connect with that of the Fifth Corps.
