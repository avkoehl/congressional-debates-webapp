HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT,
Richmond, December 29, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Honorable Mr. Reagan.

This is subject over which I have no control. These troops are turned out by order of the Secretary of War on account of the emergencies in the front, and the application should go to him. I would observe, however, that I have frequent applications from ladies, who are well recommended and in great want, and are apparently well fitted for clerical duty.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, SUBSISTENCE, DEPT.,

Richmond, December 29, 1864.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: In reply to your inquiry I have to report that the unpaid requisitions of this Bureau amount to $34,002,684. 65. The debt of the Bureau is largely in excess of the requisitions issued, for the following reasons, viz: No estimates have been received from several districts for November and December, and in nearly every district the estimates for December will fall short, from the fact that officers are now paying vicinage appraisement prices instead of schedule rates for all subsistence delivered prior to 1st of February, 1865. Requisitions for the full amount of the indebtedness of some officers have not been issued, because it was known that the Treasury would not meet them. For example, the indebtedness in the State of Georgia is $12,000,000 or $13,000,000, of which there are requisitions for only about $7,000,000. In response to an inquiry from the War Department, $12,500,000 of the appropriation for the Subsistence Bureau was appropriated for the Trans-Mississippi Department, and Major W. B. Blair, chief commissary of subsistence for that department, was designated as the office to draw for that amount. The Treasury
