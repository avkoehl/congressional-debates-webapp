reduction of taxation and relieve the people !
from The heavy and onerous burden of support-
in.: :m army for the purposes of this so-called
Mr. 1U Tl.HR. Mr. Chairman, I had not
exp vtml to go into this class of observations
upon this bill. 1 supposed we had heard all
the £;".itleman from New York had to say
upon the physical qualities of the negro yes-
terday. We listened to him upon that subject
with patience and, if we are to believe some
of the public prints, with admiration. But
the gentleman seems to be anxious upon the
subject of expenditure for transportation in
the South. What, sir, are the bills run up for
transportation in the South'? I will tell him.
One of the expenses in reconstruction from
which we propose to relieve the people of the
South is shown by the bill I hold in my hand.
It is an official copy of a bill rendered by the
chief of police of New Orleans to the city treas-
urer for services after the murder of the mem-
bers of the convention, which was paid.
" Comptroller's Office, City Hall,
"New Orleans, Sovember 18,1S67.
[Copy.]
" Office of the Chief of Police,
"Xew Orleans. August 10,1S6C.
"City of New Orleans to Thomas E. Adams, Dr.
"For cash paid for hauling forty-six loads of dead
and wounded from around Alechanies' Institute to
station-houses at three dollars, S13.S,"
That is the way the unreconstructed rebels
talk about the dead and dying murdered Union
men. " Forty-six loads of dead and wounded !'"
A general upon the battle field counts his dead
as so many human beings. This chief of police
charges over his own signature as would a scav-
enger for a load of filth, for—
" Forty-six loads of dead and wounded from Me-
chanics' Institute to station-houses, at three dollars,
$138.
"Paid for carrying dead from station-houses to
work-house yard, eight loads, three dollars, twenty-
four dollars.
" Paid for fifteen loads wounded from station to
Freedmen's hospital, four dollars, sixty dollars."
It would seem that it was cheaper for the city
of New Orleansto transport loads of dead than
wounded. A dollar a load! That was the
reason, perhaps, they murdered and crushed
the life out of so many. There is economy for
you!
" Paid carriage and cab hire for myself and aids
during the week of the riot, seventy-five dollars."
Thus, while the dead and dying Union citi-
zens—the lamented Dostie, for example—were
sent by loads in a cart to the station-houses and
to the work-house yard, this chief of police
and his aids, their murderers, were riding in
" carriage:and cab'' at the expense of the city
of seventy live dollars.
Now. sir, what are the purposes for which we
propose these appropriations to carry oat recon-
struction? First, as a measure of economy,
to get rid of this standing army of which the
gentleman complains, and put krto loyal hands
freedom secured hy ballot, which was wrested
from them, white and black, by unhallowed
treason and rebellion. We propose it as a meas-
ure of relief. We want to relieve the people
of the South from such tax bills as the one I
have read. We propose it as a measure of
justice, to give to those who have fought for us
and with us, whatever may be their color,-the
right and power of self-protection, so that we
may no longer be called upon to protect them
by our soldiers. We propose it, sir, as the
great finishing up of the rebellion, which during
all these years of war and unquiet peace has
received the sympathy of those who are acting
with the member from New York, because we
believe that when we have given the ballot to
these loyal men of the South they will protect
themselves, and that the ballot will be around
them, doing more duty than an armed police-
man in keeping them from all wrong and out-
rage.
.Sir, I listen to all these attacks upon the
negro and this talk that the Democracy are
going to take away the ballot from him with the
utmost contempt. What, sir! take away the
ballot from nearly six millions of people who
40th Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 19.
have tasted its sweets, felt its power, and were
shielded by its protection! take away that
great franchise from almost a nation! take
away this safeguard of freedom which 110 peo-
ple who ever enjoyed ever yet surrendered
save with their lives! You may talk about it,
you may plot for it, you may try for it, you
may scheme for it, and with all the aid of all
the powers of death and hell, but let me say
that the ballot, once in the hands of millions
of freemen, never was and never can be taken
away. That is afixed fact, fixed beyond airier-
adventure, and whoever arrays himself against
it simply buts his head against a wall. 1 have
heard enough of this talk about taking away
the ballot from the negro. Whenever it is
attempted I hope my friends on the other side
will go South and head the army of subjuga-
tion, and when they do they will be welcomed
in a way by which, in my judgment, they will
learn that the negro has some of the highest
attributes of manhood—to wit, courage to main-
tain his rights, knowledge to appreciate them,
and steadfastness never to yield them up.
Mr. GETZ. May I ask the gentleman whether
he means that the army he speaks of will be
' "welcomed with bloody hands to hospitable
| graves" or not?
Mr. BUTLER. No, sir, no; the negro is of
a kind, amiable, forgiving disposition, whatever
ethnologists may say of his blood, and when the
gentlemen fall in such an unhallowed contest
they will be taken kindly in the best way they
can and cared for with tenderness and mercy;
not thrown into carts and carried to Work-
houses, not given over to the tender mercies
of the station-house, but brought perhaps to the
lowly cabin where nursing and kindness will
take the place of true valor, firmly-determined
battling for rights.
i Let me say to gentlemen, too, that the negro
has fought for us, and he will fight for himself
whenever he is attacked, and not till then;
and when gentlemen tell us there will be a
war of races I say that it is like every other
of these predictions about the negro—false.
You said he would not fight, but he did fight.
You said he would not work, buthe does work.
You said if we gave him a vote he would vote
just as his master wanted him to. That is
1 exactly the way he did not vote. [Laughter.]
You said he did not know how to vote. Well,
the negroes vote just as I would have done if
1 had been in their places, and that is as good
t voting as I desire. [Laughter.] It is said they
1 are going to rise and that we are to have a war
of races. Why shonld they rise, and upon
whom will they rise? They have the power
i now because they are the laboring bone and
sinew of that country, because they are the
- loyal nlen of that country. Rise ? Why, they
I are at the top now, gentlemen on the other
! side say. What should they rise for? How
j are they to get up any higher than to the top,
as they are, if we are to believe gentlemen
opposite?
Oh, no: I have listened to these croaking
' predictions of evil; the country has'listened
; to them. They are the false prophecies of false
prophets.
j Let me say to you, Mr. Ch'airman, and to the
committee, that we of the party of progress,
, of equality, of right, and of freedom shall take
i no step backward. Theballot put in the hands
! of a man created in the image of his God will
; remain in his hands, as his greatest boon and
! blessing, until he chooses to relinquish it; and
no power can take it From his hands. Whoever
| tries to take it from him will try an experiment
that in the history of the world never yet has
j succeeded ; and 1, without claiming the gift of
| prophecy, will say, an experiment which never
i will succeed.
But I beg pardon of the committee for this
.digression. The gentleman from New York
1 [Mr. Brooks] by his remarks led me out of
the line of legitimate argument upon this ap-
propriation bill. If I have erred in that respect
it is because I have followed a bad example.
Mr. RANDALL. Will the gentleman per-
mit me to ask him a question ?
Mr. BUTLER. Yes, sir; any question.
Mr. RANDALL. I would ask the gentle-
man what is his plan—I have seen it intimated
in the papers that he has a plan—by which he
proposes to introduce negro voting into Penn-
sylvania and other States where the State con-
stitution and laws do not permit it.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I would
inquire if this bill was made the special order
or not.
Mr. RANDALL. I know that my question
is a very disorderly question.
Mr. BUTLER. I will yield no further than
to answer the question of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Randall,] and to say that
I have no such plan.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I would
inquire of the Chair if this bill is a special
order.
The CHAIRMAN. It is.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Then I
ask that the discussion be confined to the
merits of the bill.
Mr. BUTLER. I desire to say to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania that I have no such
plan; that I never had any such plan ; that I
never force anything upon anybody unless they
deserve it
The CHAIRMAN. The bill will now be
read by paragraphs for amendment.
The first-paragraph was read, as follows:
Be it enacted, <£-c., That the following sums, or so
much thereof as may be necessary, be, and the same
are hereby, appropriated, out of any moneys in the
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the objects
hereinafter expressed for the fiscal year ending June
30,1868, namely:
To provide tor the expenses of carrying into effect
the act to provide for the more efficient government
of the rebel States; for the first military district, the
sum of $511,000: for the second military district, tho
sum of $110,000: for the third military district, the
sum of 897,000; for the fourth military district, the
sum of $150,000; and for tho lil'th military district,
the sum of 8250,000; making in all the sum of 6657,000.
Mr. WOOD. I desire to say a word or two
upon this bill.
Mr. BUTLER. I cannot yield the floor for
any such purpose.
Mr. WOOL). I submit that we have aright
to debate this bill.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair understood
the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. But-
ler] to yield the floor, which lias been claimed
and conceded to the gentleman from New
York, [Mr. Wood.]
Mr. BUTLER. I have not yielded the floor,
except to have the bill read by paragraphs for
amendment.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman neces-
sarily yielded the floor for that purpose.
Mr. BUTLER. I called for the reading of
the bill as a part of my remarks.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair decides that
the gentleman from New York [Mr. Wood] is
entitled to the floor.
Mr. WOOD. I have risen more particularly
for the purpose of protesting against a bill of
this magnitude being passed through the Com-
mittee of the Whole without any discussion
upon its merits, and without the attention of
this House and of the country being called to
the fact that it proposes to appropriate nearly
thirteen million dollars for a pretended defi-
ciency.
1 do not propose to follow the line of argu-
ment in which the gentleman from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Butler] has indulged, because I
am without the data which his position upon
the committee from which this bill was re-
ported gives him in reference to the details
and items which go to make up this bill in the
aggregate. He has, however, in replying to
mv colleague [Mr. Brooks] with reference to
some of these expenses for reconstruction,
referred to some police items in the city of
New Orleans, amounting altogether, I believe,
to about one hundred thousand dollars. Tie
appears to be exceedingly familiar with the
police department and with the violation of
municipal law so far as New Orleans is con-
cerned. I do not think, sir, that we on this
side of the House can attempt to discuss that
branch of these expenditures with the gentle-
