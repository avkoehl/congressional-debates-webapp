Try and ascertain the strength of enemy, and if he has any infantry supports. Send out scouts in all directions. Make arrangements for communicating in letters to us, in case telegraph line be cut. Concentrate your forces and fight like the devil. General says you will have help from us, and if you whip him recollect you have him at mercy.

Information from Lebanon is to the effect that there is no rebel force there. Pegram is at Baird's Mills, with two brigades and two batteries, grinding the wheat recently taken from Lebanon. Report about Lebanon is that Morgan has left Alexandria, to cross at Carthage or Gainesborough and go into Kentucky.
