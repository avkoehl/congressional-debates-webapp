stnlatwts of the United States ofAmerica, m Congress
assembled, That the Secictaiy of State be, and he
hereby is, authorized and directed to permit Jared
Sparks to íetain the papers of General Washing
ton, now in his possession, m virtue of a contract |
and agreement with the late Bushrod Washing-
ton, until he shall have completed the publication
of the woiks of General Washington, on which
he is now engaged, or until otherwise ordered by
Congiess, and that the Secretary of State be
authorized and directed forthwith to pay to George
C Washington the balance of the money due to
him under the ac' approved on the 30th day of
June, 1831, foi the purchase of the books and
papers of General Washington
Mr GILLET begged to inquire of the gentle
man who íepoited the resolution [Mr Everett,
of Massachusetts,] whethci any intimation was
given last year, when the anangement was made
lor the purchase of these papers, that theie was
any lien upon  them, Or any contract by which
they could be withhdd fiom the hands of Gov
ernment as soon as the appiopnation was made'
Mr   EVERETT lephed, that the whole cit-
cumstances and history of the case, and the pre
cise condition and situation of the papers, had
been fully spread before the House in the docu-
ments piesented lastyear—the contents of which
he presumed to bo w ithin the knowledge of most
gentlemen piescnt
Mr GILLET had perused those documents
and the repoit lefened to by the gentleman, but
he had no íecollection of anything in the natuic
of a lien upon those papéis The question then
was confined to their -value and historical and
documentary importance, and the purchase was
regarded, by himself at l ast, as unconditional,
and without any contingencies  Not a word
was said about their being mortgaged, and Mi
Spaiks's communication was confined to the sub
jectof their value Mr G said 1 e considered it
wrong that any poi tion of the mon^y should have
been paid until the Government had been in pos
session of all the papéis He believed Mr
Spaiks to be as honoiable aman as lived, but his
demise, oi many other circumstances, might in-
tervene tojeopaidtheirsecunty He u as decided-
ly of opinion that the íesolution ought not to
pass
Mr EVERETT explained that more than one
half of the papéis weie alicady in the possession
of the Government, and that the loan of the íesi
due was asked for only till the completion of the
work in which Mi Spaiks wis engaged, which
would, in all probab h y, not extend beyoi d
another yeai—thiee f)ui lis ofit being finished
Mi E could see no objection to the passage of
the i (.solution, for the papéis weie as safe m Mi
Spark s hinds asthev would be in the possession
of their intended depository All partus desned
it The Secretaiy of State, Mi Wtsh'nston,
Mr Sparks, and he hoped a majouty of the
House
Mr P VliKER agieed with thegentleman from
New Yoik, [M\ Gilí it,] and with him vva3
ignoiant of the authonty of Ml Spaiks to detain
tnese papers 1 hey ouglit now to be in their
propei custody, and not a* Bosam, oi any othei
part of the United btit"s All that ouglit now
to be asked by the gentleman should be, tint he
might be peimittcd at Washington to mike such
an examination of, and take such txtucis Aom
them, as might be deemed noces*u> to the com
pletionoflnswoik Mi P i i'scd tlusobjccaon
last yeai, that toe money should no  be paid till
the ¡iiueisliid been cicliveicd, and he tuisted (hat
ti e balance would be withheld till that had been
(loin .
Mi WNDERPOEL had vot^d last session in
fivoi of the appiopiiition for the puich sl of
tl« so papus, mil In did so, as he believed the
mijoiitv. did, in the undeistandmg that they
vvouid come imm diaalj into tie hands of the

Mi VNADIiPOIL was not pieviously
iw<. _ of iliat, but still it anpeared to him that
the House ought not to pay away the money
asked for without a full equivalent He had
been in favor of the appropnation first as relics
of the great Father of his Country, and then
because assurances were given that their posses-
sion would be the means of efectmg a great
saving of the public money For these reasons,
and others that might be urged, Mi V was un-
willing to vo'e for the payment of the balance of
the appropriation until the papers had been de-
livered up
Mr MERCERcalledtheattentionoftheHouse
to the fact that Mi Sparks had been engaged by
the Government in the compilation of the diplo-
matic history of the United States, and surely no
one would conceive these papers to be mseciiie
in such hands
Mi EVERETT would add, that Mr Sparks
was not only employed by the Government to
prepare this compilation, but he had been per-
mitted to take out fiom the Department of State
all the requisite revolutionary documents, and
that he had ananged, indexed, and put them in
regular order All that was asked the House
was to giant the same permission that had been
given by the late Judge Washington, whose rev-
erence feu his great relative would have prevented
his placing them where their security would be
hazarded
Mi JONES, of Georgia, begged to ask the
gentleman from Massachusetts what amount of
money had been already paid >
Mi EVERETT said $20,000 out of $25,000,
the sum agieed upon
Mr JONES thought enough had b en done,
and he should be unwilling to pay any further
sum until the papers had been delivered Theie
had been considciable discussion on this subject
last year The jiosstssors of the pipéis fust
asked $20,000, and as soon as Congress agieed
to give that sum, and a bill had been repoited
for the pui pose, they then asked §25,000, and
now we find that theie is some contingency, or
lien, by which they aie withheld, and will be
withheld no one knew how long, even aftei the
whole sum should be paid Mr J said he felt
bound to vote against the resolutioi
Aftei a ftw fuithei íemarks from Mr EVER-
ETT, Mi VINTON, and Mi PARKER, who
read the act of last session—
Mr McVEAN said he could not see vv hat the
House had to do with Mi Spaiks The papéis
had been puichased of Judge Bishrod Washing
ton, and to him they had to loon for them, foi
there was no íeseivation m the contiact that we
were to receive them of Mi Spaiks The ques
Hon was, if they should pty the residue of the
money until the papers weie delivered up, and
Mi McV was of opinion they ought not, and
should vote accordingly
Mi MINERandMi BATESbueflysupported
the íesoluuon
Mi    CLAPTON   said  if these  papéis were
woith anything to the United States, it was plain
they had the light to them      Piom the contrict
made by the late Judge Bushrod Washington with
' Mi   Spaiks, this gentleman might ictain them as
long as he pleased, fo-it-vas lelf ontucly to him-
self" to say when he had done v/ith them     Ho
mi°-ht give them up whenever h" thought proper,
1 forCongiess had no power to take them out of
his hand , he having, by agieement, a pnoi claim
to then possession     Mr C   cxpicssed his in
tention oí voting against the passage o*"the íeso-
1 lution                                                                        .
Th  ycis and nays having been oideied, the
uestion was then taken, md decided in the nig
postpone, it was decided in the negative—ayes 75,
noes 76
Mr MERCER said*, to avoid along discussion
on this subject, and at the same time give the
House an opportunity for its mature consideia-
tion, he would piopose that it be postponed to a
foitmght from next Monday.
Mi GILLET moved that it be indefinitely
postponed
Mi WHITTLESEY, of Ohio, asked if this
question did not require a vote of two thirds of
the House to decide upon it, accoidmg to the
rules'
The CHAIR explained, and, without taking
the question on the subject of reconsideration,
the House passed to th" special order of the day,
being the bill for the íehef of Commodore Isaac
Hull, and th" amenlment of the Committee of
the Whole, striking out allowances foi compen-
sation as navy agent
Mi  PEARCE, of Rhod  Island, was in favor
of the amendment, and in opposition to the allow-
ances claimed
Mr BURGES followed m support of the claim.
Mr PARKER opposed it, and
Mr BINNEY stated th.. t he w shed to address
a few remarks to tlie House on this subject, and
was prepaied  to proceed if it was the general
wish longei to continue the sitting, but as the hour
was somewhat advanced, to try the sense of the
House, he would move an adjournment
The  motion was agieed to, and the House
adjourned______________________
