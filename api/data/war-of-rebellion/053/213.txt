SIGNAL STATION No. 1,

Cameron's Hill, October 9, 1863-2.40 p.m.

Captain JESSE MERRILL,

Chief Signal Officer:

CAPTAIN: See small column of smoke rising in Lookout Valley about 12 miles southwest. The main rebel force in sight extends from a point 30 degrees east of south to a point 35 degrees south of east. Not so many there as yesterday. From 35 degrees south of east to 15 degrees south of east can see but three of four small squads, not to exceed a regiment in the aggregate. From 15 degrees south of east to east, can see nearly as many as yesterday, but they have gone from our extreme left entirely, where there were several regiments last night. The above refers to troops at foot of ridge. On top of ridge the force I reported last night east southeast is gone. The guns, nine in number, 35 degrees south of east, are still visible in position. Large column of smoke due south, 2 1/2 miles distant.

Respectfully,

HOWGATE,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.
