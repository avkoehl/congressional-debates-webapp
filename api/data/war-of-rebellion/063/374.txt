Major General JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps:

In answer to your communication of to-night, I am directed to inform you that a brigade of General A. J. Smith's command is posted on the Opelousas road, about 4 miles from this place, at the fork of the Opelousas and Bayou Robert road, and will give all the necessary support to your left flank. It is the opinion of the commanding general that the dispositions already made will be sufficient without calling in any working party from across the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
