Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nearly all the bands of guerrillas have moved near to the line of Jackson and La Fayette Counties. I have troops moving in that direction. Appearances indicate a combined movement of the robbers.

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 26, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that the order for the execution of Erwin was countermanded. The guerrilla chief Anderson has seized Duck, the postmaster at Wellington, and two others, whom he says he will shoot if I execute Erwin. I have ordered that 6 of the most prominent rebels or rebel sympathizers in the vicinity of Wellington shall be seized and put in close confinement, in irons, to be held as hostages for Duck and his companions, and that they have the facilities afforded them to inform the guerrillas of the fate that awaits them if our friends are not returned in safety.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 26, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I respectfully request that two companies of the One hundred and thirty-fifth and the headquarters of the regiment be moved from the Osage and the Gasconade bridges to Jefferson city. I think that one company to each bridge (as they will be protected by blockhouses) is sufficient guard, while the capitol and the stores at Jefferson City should be protected by a larger force than I can otherwise send them.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

Colonel PHILLIPS:

SIR: In obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 8, dated headquarters camp near Warrensburg, June 18, 1864, I have the honor to report the following:

I left here on the evening of the 18th instant with 25 men of D Company, Seventh Missouri State Militia, reached Clear Fork at midnight, and on the morning of the 19th I proceeded up the creed some 6 miles, where I struck the trial of some bushwhackers. I dismounted my men and followed them on foot several miles through the brush, when I concluded that they were striking for the timber on Tedbo Cree. I then mounted and scouted on Tedbo Creek until midnight of the 19th instant, and camped in the brush 5 miles from Belmont until morning, and on the 20th I returned to the head of Clear Fork Creek, where I scouted through the brush during the day.
