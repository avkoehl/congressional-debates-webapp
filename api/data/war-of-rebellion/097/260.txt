During the afternoon troops from the right have passed my front going toward the left. Their numbers were perhaps 4,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,March 29, 1865 - 9.45 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

A lieutenant and six men from Steuart's brigade, of Pickett's division, have just come in. The officer reports that his brigade was on the line near the Squirrel Level road and the other brigades of the division were on the Cox road, tree miles from town; that his brigade moved about two hours before dark toward their right to form a junction, as was understood, with the other brigades, the whole to continue toward the right, but to what point was not known. One other brigade, which one not known, was under similar orders. He knows of no other movement of troops. Two deserters from Scales' brigade report that the line of their division has been extended to the right, their own brigade having been extended a little.

Major-General ORD:

It appears on further investigation that the brigades of Wilcox's division, instead of strenchening out, moved a little to their right without extending their front.

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865 - 10.45 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

All reports agree in stating that the only change on the part of the enemy in my front up to this time is the increased activity of his working parties engaged in perfecting his line. It is believed no troops have been withdrawn from the front of the corps.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
