The SPEAKER. The bill will be read for
information.
The bill was read. The first section pro-

of the United States shall otherwise provide,
shall govern as to the competency of witnesses
in all criminal trials in such courts.
The second section provides that in all crim-
inal cases in the courts of the District of Co-
lumbia and the several Territories the party
charged, at his own request and not otherwise,
may be a witness; but his neglect to testify
shall not be considered by the jury as evidence
against him.
The third section provides that in all courts
held under the authority of the United States
in the several States and Territories and in the
District of Columbia parties in civil actions
and proceedings, including probate and bank-
ruptcy proceedings, suits in equity, and divorce
suits, (exceptthose in which a divorce is sought
on the ground of alleged adultery of either
party,) shall be admitted as competent wit-
nesses for themselves or any other party ; and
in any such case in which the wife is a party or
one of the parties, she and her husband shall
be competent witnesses for and against each
other, but they shall not be allowed to testify
as to private conversations with each other.
Where one of the original parties to the con-
tract or cause of aetion in issue and on trial is
dead, or is shown to the court to be insane, the
other party is not to be admitted to testify in
his own favor unless the contract in issue was
originally made with a person who is living and
competent to testify, except as to such acts and
contracts as have been done or made since the
probate of the will or the appointment of the
administrator.
The fourth section provides for the repeal of
the proviso in section three, chapter two hun-
dred and ten, of the act approved July 2, 1864,
and all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with
the provisions of this act.
