Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

I have just read the report of furloughs and discharges at Atlanta- from General Bragg's troops alone 66 discharges and 1,482 furloughs in three months preceding January 14-and respectfully repeat my recommendation, that Article IV, General Orders, No. 72, be revoked, because it is draining the army.
