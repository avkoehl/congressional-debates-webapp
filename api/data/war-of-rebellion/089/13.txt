HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 1, 1864-10.15 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Mott should take the ammunition train allowed with troops and ambulances, &amp;c. Supply wagons should go over to Weldon railroad in order to let him fill up his haversacks. In speaking in previous dispatch of railroad station near Mott's headquarters, I referred to his old headquarters near trestle railroad bridge.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-11 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

General Mott has been ordered in accordance with your dispatch. His field return shows 6,001 enlisted men for duty and 324 officers. He leaves about 300 men on picket. I could not relieve them on account of the lateness of the hour the order was received. Nine negroes who left Petersburg at 9 last evening were sent to your headquarters a short time ago. They report that the line in front of Petersburg was thinned out last night, about one brigade having been gotten out. They were not, however, closely questioned.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General MEADE:

General Mott's division will bring about 5,000 men, I suppose, and as it is comparatively well officered, I think it will do very well and may at a critical time turn the tide. I hope circumstances many admit of its being put in in mass if it is called upon, as I think it will do much better than by brigades; it is now loading.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.

I will add that Gregg's cavalry will fight remarkably well dismounted, holding a defensive position.
