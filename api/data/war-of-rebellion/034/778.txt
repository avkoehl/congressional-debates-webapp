General BURNSIDE:

Fighting at Buffington confirmed; cannot hear the result. Rebels may try to cross at Cutler's Ford, at lower end of Vienna Island, which is in fine condition for crossing. I have 300 men fortifying the ford, and they shall not cross there. They may try to cross the Muskingum, if driven from the Ohio. I will do my best to prevent it.
