The farms to be selected will be taken when practicable from that class of owners exempted from the benefit of the President's amnesty proclamation. A military superintendent will be placed in charge of each county poor farm. Through this agent minors will be bound out, contracts for hire will be secured for the able-bodied, work in the penitentiary department will be provided for the unwilling, and food for the helpless. As the citizens of the counties shall experience the benefits of these institutions they will be permitted to bear the expenses of their establishments and maintenance. Brigadier General C. K. Graham, commanding Norfolk, Portsmouth, and defenses,is charged with the execution of this order, and will immediately proceed to make selection of the farms in each county.

Princess Anne and Norfolk Counties, being provided for on the above principles, are excepted from the operation of this order. Special assignments to the command of counties will be made hereafter.
