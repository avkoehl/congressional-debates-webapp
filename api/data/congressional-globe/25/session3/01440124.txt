this House, and especially upon the resolutions
and amendments now under consideration; bat,
concurring in the decision made by the Chair in
the question of order now raised, and as an ap-
peal had  heen   taken from that decision to the
House, he felt bound by every consideration of
duty which he-owed to himself and the privileges
due to every member of the House, briefly to
assign the reasons for the opinion he entertained.
He regretted that, in the views he should present
upon this subject, he should be compelled, by
way of illustration, to allude to the practice of
another legislative body, over whose deliberations
he long had the honor of presiding.
_ Mr. Speaker, (said Mr. B.,) what is the ques-
tion we are called upon to decide?  Certain reso-
lutions have been introduced proposing to raise a
committee to investigate the defalcation of Mr.
Swart wout, late collector at the port of New York;
a motion had been  made by his colleague [Mr.
Wise] to amend the resolutions so as to change
the mode of appointing the committee, by insert-
ing the word's "by ballot;" and the gentleman
from  Maryland  [Mr.  Thomas]   had   moved  to
amend the amendment by substituting in lieu
thereof, " viva voce."    He asked whether it was
in order to move to amend the amendment ? There
could be no doubt upon that point.    It is a prin-
ciple of parliamentary law recognized by every
writer upon the subject, ami practiced upon by
every legislative body known to our history, that j
a further amendment at this time would not be in j
order.   However inconsistent or incompatible an |
amendment may be to one already agreed to, or I
to   the  mam question itself, it furnished ptoper j
ground for its rejection by the House; but it could
not be suppressed by the Speaker.   Suppose that
the proposition of the gentleman from Maryland
was in direct and palpable violation of the Con-
stitution of the United States: could the Speaker
say that it was out of order, and, therefore, not
entertain the motion? Surely not, sir. Each mem-
ber decides for himself what is constitutional or
unconstitutional, expedientar inexpedient.  The
only question for the Speaker to decide, when a
proposition is submitted, is, whether it is in order
to amend.   If that question be answered affirma-
tively, he has no right to decide upon the char-
acter or bearing of the proposition or amendment.
If this amendment to the amendment should be
adopted, and finally become incorporated with,
and stand as a part of, the original resolution,
then, by another rule of the House, it would re-
quire two thirds of the members present to pass
the resolution, which he believed would be cairied
by nine tenths of the membeis of this body; for
no member was opposed to this investigation.   In
the House of Delegates of Virginia everything
is decided by a majority of the House; we know
nothmgof this two-thirds system.   By a standing
rule of that House, no committee, whether stand-
ing or select, shall be less than five, nor more than
thirteen members; it had often happened there,
upon great and general questions, affecting every
portion of the Htatc, that a resolution would be
adopted directing the Speaker to take one mem-
ber from each congressional or senatorial district;
the standing rule, by the action of the House
itself, would be, pro initio, suspended or repealed; i
so the same principle would prevail here under ;
the rules of this House.    But, sir, you are doing j
every day in practice  the identical principle in-1
volved in this amendment.  He would not, how-!
ever, recapitulate and comment upon the prece-
dents and authorities brought to bear upon this i
question by the Speaker, and would not trespass ,
longer upon the patience of the House, believm
that action was more important than words.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Maryland, replied  briefly
Mr. WISE thereupon withdrew his appeal.
Mr. CAMBRELENG so modified his original
resolution as to accept the words " viva voce," in
the place of "by ballot."
Mr. WISE inquired if the resolution, in this
form, providing (or the appointment of the com-
mittee viva voce, was in order?
The SPEAKER decided it to be in order; but
that, if the resolution, in its modified form, be
agreed to, it would operate as a suspension of
the rules, and would require a " vote of at least
two thirds of the members present" to pass the
same; and that, if not passed by a vote of two
thirds, the message of the President would re-
main the business before the House, subject to
be referred to a committee to be appointed by
ballot, or to any other disposition which the
House might choose to make of it.
The resolution being modified by the mover to
read, "appointed by the House viva voce," the
amendment moved to the original resolution by
Mr. Garland, of Virginia, and the amendment
moved thereto by Mr. Thomas, fell.
Mr. MARVIN asked whether it would be in
order so to amend the resolution, as modified, as
to strike out the words " viva voce," and insert
the words " by ballot?"
The SPEAKER decided that it would.
Mr. MARVIN then moved to amend the res-
olution accordingly.
Mr. GARLAND, of Louisiana, demanded the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered; and, being
taken, resulted—yeas 113, nays 105; as follows:

So the amendment of Mr. Mari in was agreed
to.
The question then recurred upon the adoption
of the resolutions; and upon that question,
Mr. KENNEDY demanded the yeas and nays;
which were not ordered.
The resolutions, as follows, were then agreed
to:
Rewired, That the communication from the President
[ of the United State , of the 8th of December, 1S3J, relating
to the defalcation of tile late collector of the port of New
York, except so much as relates to a modification of the
of the'sBntX',aiddin °PPTi0'! t0 íc d1ecis'°'1 I   revenue laws, be referred to a select committee of nine
ot tne speaker, and contended that the adoption 1   members, to be appointed by the House bv ballot, whose
of the  two-third principle, by entertaining the
motion to incorporate in this resolution the words
"vim voce," would be practicing a fraud upon
the House.
The SPEAKER here made a further brief ex-
planation in support of his decision.
Mr. HARLAN moved the previous question
upon the appeal; which was seconded.
The main question being, " Shall the decision
of the Chair stand as the judgment of the
House?"
Mr. CAMBRELENG demanded the yeas and
nays upon that question; which were ordered.
duty ltshall be to inquire into the causes and extent of the
late defalcation*! of the custom house at New York and
oilier places; the length of tune they have existed ; the cor- I
rcctness of the returns which have been made by the col-
lectois, naval and other officers, and the deposit banks, re-
spectively ; and all such facts connected with the said defal-
cations as maybe deemed matciiat to develop their true
character.
Be it further resolved, That the said committee be required
to inquire into, and make report of, any defalcations among
the collectors, receivers, and disbursers of the public
I money, which mav now exist; who are the defaulters;
the amount of defalcations, the length nt time they have
existed, and the causes which led to them; and that the
said cominee have power to send foi persons and papers."
Mr. CAMBRELENG expressed a wish that
the House would make it the order of the day for
to-morrow to go into a ballot.
Mr. COFFIN moved that the House proceed
immediately to ballot.
Mr. GRANT moved that the House adjourn;
which was taken by tellers, and decided in the
negative.
Mr. Coffin's motion was then agreed to; and
the House accordingly proceeded to ballot.
The SPEAKER appointed Messrs. Drom-
güule, Oakland of Virginia, and Marvin, as
tellers to count the ballots.
Number of ballots 110; necessary to a choice,
106; of which—
