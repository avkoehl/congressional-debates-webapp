EXHIBIT D.
HDQRS. ARMY OF TENN., OFFICE CHIEF QUARTERMASTER,Tullahoma, Tenn., March 3, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel E. J. HARVIE,

Inspector-General, General Johnston's Staff:

COLONEL: In obedience to your verbal orders of this date. I have the honor respectfully to make the following report:

There is now on hand in store the following amount of corn:

Bushels.

At Tullahoma............................................ 8,000

At Decatur.............................................. 8,000

At Bridgeport........................................... 6,000

At Chattanooga.......................................... 3,000

At Dalton............................................... 10,000

At Athens............................................... 10,000

At Stevenson............................................ 4,000

In addition to the above, the corps of Lieutenant-General Polk, at Shelbyville, and Lieutenant-General Hardee, at Tullahoma, have on hand, already issued, forage of corn for four days. The cavalry are at present foraging themselves in the country in which they are now operating east of the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. The district of country is being rapidly exhausted of forage by Major General Wheeler's corps of cavalry and the supply cannot last in that district beyond twenty days from the present date. The country west of the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad is now supplying forage for General Van Dorn's corps of cavalry and the animals of Lieutenant-General Polk's corps. This district is much better supplied with forage than the district east of road, and, if the posts at Columbia and Shelbyville can be maintained, will furnish forage for General Van Dorn's corps of cavalry and animals of Lieutenant-General Polk's corps for two months from this date, the supply being hauled by the wagons of these respective corps. The present source of supply for Lieutenant-General Hardee's corps, as well as the accumulation of reserve, is from Northern Alabama, and the counties of Giles and Maury, in Tennessee. The supplies are hauled to the depots at Athens and Decatur by the wagons belonging to this army, and from Decatur are transported to Bridgeport and Chattanooga by two steamboats now in the employ of Government, and from Athens to this point by means of Memphis and Charleston and Nashville and Chattanooga Railroads. From these sources we can have brought here 3,000 bushels per day.

2nd. Clothing: The command has been fully supplied with clothing (except shoes), and 6,000 suits are now in depot at Chattanooga. Requisitions for 10,000 pairs of shoes have been made upon the general depots at Columbus and Atlanta, Ga. These will fully supply the wants of this army for next month. The command is at present fully supplied with horse and mule shoes, with arrangements made for manufacture of 150,000 per month for future.

I inclose a consolidated report of field transportation, in addition. There are now on hand in depot at Chattanooga 50 new wagons, with harness. Contracts have been made for manufacture of 150 spring-wagons for ambulances, and 300 four-horse wagons, to supply the deficiency created by wear of our present supply of wagons, which are old and in many cases unserviceable on the rough roads of this section. These wagons and ambulances are being delivered weekly at Atlanta. The want of tire iron has caused some delay in completion of these
