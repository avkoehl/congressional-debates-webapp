General HARTSUFF:

The following has been received from General Boyle:

There is room to believe that Wheeler's force, and probably others of Bragg's army, have backed into Sequatchie Valley, and moved to left of Rosecrans, and are now in Kentucky. Where will troops be gotten to meet them? They will move directly for this city if they are in the State. I can raise 1,000 or more men if I had arms, but with such an ordnance officer as is here, arms can't he had. I am asked to furnish arms to arm part of Indiana Legion. I have no control of arms.

BOYLE.

Have you any information of this force?

CAMP NELSON, July 8, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I am perplexed by the accounts of Wheeler. Have just heard from Judah at Elizabethtown. He says colonel commanding infantry at Vaughn's Ferry reports Wheeler crossing with large force at bridge near Green River, above Columbia. Colonel Moore reports no confirmation of his news, and that barricade he made in road at Muldraugh's Hill remains there. I have ordered him to send small scouting party to Campbellsville, reporting back from New Market and from Muldraugh's Hill. I still believe it to be a ruse, and the supposition will account for the rumors coming from so many sources. The plan being to send from Columbia the same time to the nearest troops, in every direction, I will use the infantry of Carter to Danville, and save a little distance if obliged to move either toward Lebanon or above. I leave at daylight for Stanford.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

You will, as quietly as possible, remove all the public stores, &amp;c., across the river to Jeffersonville. I have telegraphed Lieutenant Smyser that he must issue arms and ammunition upon your requisition. They must be taken for the defense of the city, and, if the place is attacked, you must defend it till the last.

A gunboat and a battery have left here for Louisville. I cannot order any up from Cairo, but have informed Commodore Pennock, who
