Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel D. T. Chandler, U. S. Army, will proceed to the headquarters of the Army and deliver the dispatches with which he is charged. He will travel with all possible haste, as it is important that the information contained in the communications intrusted to his charge should reach Washington as early as possible.

On arriving in Louisiana Colonel Chandler will communicate with the governor of that State, and ascertain it a safe transit for the troops evacuating Texas will be afforded through the State of Louisiana, with permission to purchase the necessary supplies and secure the required means of transportation. For this purpose he will deliver a communication addressed to the governor of that State by the commissioners on behalf of the committee of public safety of the State of Texas. After having complied with these instructions Colonel Chandler will return to San Antonio.

By order of Colonel C. S. Waite:

W. A. NICHOLS,Assistant Adjutant-General.
