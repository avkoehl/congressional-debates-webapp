Captain MENDELL:

Captain Harwood is here. I wish to see you about working on the redan on the plank road, when you are ready to come,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 16, 1864.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding, &amp;c.:

My redoubt is completed, except magazine and gorge defense, which are in progress. The line of rifle pits is completed for a little more than half the distance to the redoubt on the right, with the exception of a gap of 300 yards to the left of the negro brigade. Abatis is in position on the front of my redoubt, and more hauled on the flanks for about eighty yards in front of the line and along the whole length. The slashing on the left of the redoubt is nearly done. About thirty trees still standing.

F. HARWOOD,

Captain of Engineers.

[JULY 16, 1864.]

Captain HARWOOD:

I am going to have the rifle-pits begun by my corps on the right to-morrow. I went along the line to where the work stops. There is no pressing necessity for the rifle-pits. To-morrow will probably finish them. Go on with your work in the daytime.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 16, 1864-9 p.m.

General S. WILLIAMS:

I have nothing special to report this evening as having occurred to-day. Work generally goes on by daylight whenever it is practicable, and this extends all along our left from the large redoubt on the plank road to the one on the railroad. All the heavy work on this line will be done in a day or two more, and is now so far completed that I have directed a suspension of night work on it. All the redoubts are now occupied with artillery. Night work continues along the front toward the enemy, under direction of Major Duane. We shall soon have our defensive works so complete as to allow a considerable increase of our reserves, and perhaps an extension of our line to the left, so as to cover the establishment of another battery.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
