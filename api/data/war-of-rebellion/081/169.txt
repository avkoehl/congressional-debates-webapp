HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

General Potter, Ninth Corps, reports his line of battle in advance of your skirmishers. Is there not some misapprehension about this, or have you withdrawn any from the advanced position you held after your last assault?

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Barlow for explanation.

By order of Major-General Birney:

WM. R. DRIVER,Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Second indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

There is no difficulty about the connection of the lines of my division with those of the Ninth Corps. General Hartranft, commanding the right of the advanced line of the Ninth Corps, informs my staff officer that he is satisfied with the connection as it exists. If any part of my skirmish line happens to have got in rear of General Potter it shall be withdrawn. I have not withdrawn from my advanced position, and my connection with Ninth Corps, if not actual (on account of the ground), is practically complete.

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I am further informed that General Potter did not authorize the report in question, and respectfully suggest that there is some mistake in the matter.

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864.

General MEADE:

Your dispatch has been referred to General Barlow. I have not withdrawn from any of my advanced positions. The enemy's line makes an angle near the point referred to. I do not think it possible that General Potter's line is in advance of General Barlow's skirmishers, as General Barlow advanced when the last assault was made and now occupied the railroad (Norfolk) cut with his skirmish line.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General, Commanding Corps.
