Honorable E. M. STANTON:

If the State of New Hampshire will offer an extra bounty sufficient to till the First New Hampshire Cavalry to their maximum number, will you permit the companies now here to remain, and here mount the entire regiments? I saw General Burnside in New York, and from him have received his hearty approval. Orders have already been issued from the Cavalry Bureau to commence the purchase of horses, and preparations to that effect already been made. If we can fill this regiment we shall have a surplus of 500 on all calls made upon us.
