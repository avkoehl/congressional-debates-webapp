and when done it will require time to restore confidence in their ability to protect themselves, during which the use of regular military forces will be required. I submit these views to your consideration.

I am, very truly,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

MACON, MO., September 11, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

Colonel Beveridge and the additional battalion of his regiment will be of great service to this district, and I will see that their service is properly directed while they remain in the district. All the available troops of my command that can be spared from garrison duty will, for the present, operate in Chariton, Howard, Boone, Randolph, Audrain, and Monroe Counties, and the new troops are going into the brush after the whackers fast as mounted.

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., September 11, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Upon returning to my headquarters this morning I find serious trouble brewing in Nodaway County, and go to that region to give it personal attention to-night. Twenty-five of the best citizens of the county are here as refugees from a marauding band of midnight rangers, who are serving notices upon their neighbors to leave the county within five, ten, or fifteen days, or suffer death, &amp;c. I can stop this quickly by going up into that region. I have forwarded notices to the leading men of the county to meet the Committee of Public Safety with myself to devise measures to stop the infernal business. I shall have to lay my hands heavily upon certain loyalists, but the evil must be promptly checked or a reign of terror will extend over the four northwestern counties. The troops are well at work in the Boone and Howard District. I shall visit Glasgow in person during the week.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, September 11, 1864.

General DOUGLASS,

Mexico or Glasgow:

(Operator at Allen will find his whereabouts.)

Let the most vigorous work against the guerrillas in the Boone-Howard district go on. You now have a large force. Push the infantry after their haunts secretly. The gun-boat Fanny. Ogden will be at Glasgow to co-operate. Give the villains a big turn. Keep me posted daily, if possible.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
