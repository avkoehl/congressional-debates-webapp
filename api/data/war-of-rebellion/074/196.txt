Captain George M. Crane, Captain John T. McAuley, and Lieutenant Robert Martin, aides-de-camp-deserve great praise for their bravery and efficiency in action.

The enemy's loss in my front, from the dead found, is estimated at about 600. I inclose herewith an official list of casualties of the brigade.*

HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 15TH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, Ga., July 29, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by the First Brigade in the engagement with the enemy on the 28th instant:

Early in the morning we broke camp, and advanced by the left flank on the right of the Fourth Division, same being the extreme right. The advance was made through timber with heavy underbrush, over rough and uneven ground. We gained position on a ridge on the extreme right about 10 a.m.; and were attacked by the enemy in force at 12 m., the First Brigade being in reserve. It was, however, found necessary to extend our lines, when the same was ordered into position in the front. The engagement lasted from 12 m. till 4 p.m., and for severity is unsurpassed by any of the campaign. My lines were held, and the enemy repulsed in every assault with terrible slaughter. The entire command, with but a single exception, maintained their position and fought heroically, and are entitled to all praise for their good conduct. The right of the Sixth Missouri Volunteers, under the impression that they were flanked, broke, and for a time that part of the line was confused. They were soon rallied, after which their conduct was unexceptionable.

My entire loss of killed, wounded, and missing was 82. The enemy's loss in front of the division in killed [was] 320, from which I estimate the entire loss of the enemy in front of the division would amount to 2,200. The regiments composing First and Second Brigades occupying different parts of the works, it is impossible to estimate the loss in front of each.

Officers and men conducted themselves so well particular mention can hardly be made of any. I will, however, mention, as coming under my particular notice, Captain Windsor, commanding One hundred and sixteenth Illinois, and Captain Jolliff, commanding One hundred and eleventh Illinois. They were at all times during the engagement at their posts, directing the fire on the enemy and holding their respective commands steady and cool. My staff officers were at all times at their posts, and acquitted themselves with credit.
