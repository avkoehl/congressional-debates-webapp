THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 21,
telegraphed to us and spread over our coun-
try, have been misreported and misconceived,
which I shall he very glad to learn, and thus
a great misapprehension will be corrected, or
it will turn out that the honorable commis-
sioner on the part of Great Britain is wholly
mistaken in his memory or understanding of
the preliminaries of the negotiation of the
Washington treaty, or has wholly misconceived
them as well as the motives arid acts of the
American commissioners and the American
Government,, and has therefore misled his
country men by statements tending to stir up
strife between the two countries.
I have, sir, very substantial grounds for the
belief that this statement is wholly wrong
whichever way it is taken, and if the House
will have patience for a few moments, while I
state as succinctly as I may the grounds of
that, belief; I feel certain that the House and
the country will agree with me therein.
In the first place, sir, there are a few his-
torical facts that are neither forgotten nor can
be successfully disputed. First, that our min-
ister at the Court of St. James, during the
whole of the lavages by the Alabama and
kindred British cruisers, and during the whole
course of the unfriendly action of Great Britain
toward us during our late war, was pressing
upon that Government the grievous wrongs
and injuries that country was thereby inflict-
ing upon us as a nation.
Again, it is history that one of her most
eminent statesmen in Parliament, Mr. Blight,
warned his Government from his place that
its course was heaping up a claim for damages
done to the nation as well as to individual
citizens to an incalculable amount.
Still there was 110 pause by the British Gov-
ernment in its hostile course, until when the
war steamers built by the Lairds, the builders
being members of the same Parliament, were
about ready to sail, Mr. Adams, our minister,
was driven to the extremity of declaring to
the British Government that to let- them sail
was war. Then that Government paused, but
not till then.
Our minister could have hardly taken that
very bold, direct, and positive stand at that
time, which was in the very crisis of our own
war, simply because of damages expected to be
done to private individuals, if he had not felt
and believed that still greater wrong and injury
was about to be done to the nation itself by
the sailing of those new sister cruisers of the
Alabama.
Again, sir, when our war was over, by the
instruction of the State Department of a late
Administration, a convention, known as the
"Johnson and Clarendon treaty," was effected
between this Government and Great Britain,
under which the claims of individual citizens
for damages done during the war by Briiish
cruisers under the rebel flag were alone to
be adjusted and arbitrated. That treaty was
almost unanimously rejected by the Senate of
the United States, because no reparation was
provided for therein for injuries to the nation
because of the unfriendly course of Great Brit-
ain toward this country, either by the accord-
ance of belligerent rights to the confederates,
or in the transfer of American commercial
marine to the British flag, the enhanced pay-
ment of insurance, the prolongation of the
war, and the addition of a large sum to the
cost of the war, and of loss of blood in the
suppression of the rebellion, all these causes
of grievance and the consequential demands
of reparation at the hands ot the British Gov-
ernment ; and this reason for the rejection of
that treaty was notified to that Government,
not only by dispatches from the State Depart-
ment and instructions to our minister near the
Oouit of'St. Jaines, and his representations to
her Majesty's Government, but it was given to
the vyorld in the still more solemn and official
form of a direct message to the Congress of the
United States by the present chief Executive
Magistrate on the 1st of December, 1869, ap-
proving the rejection of the Johnson-Claren-
don treaty upon the very ground that these con-
sequential claims were not included in that
treaty, and approving the course of the Senate
in rejecting so futile and illusory settlement
of the questions between the two countries.
Listen to the words of the President upon this
subject addressed to an-American Congress:
"Tow'ard the close of the last Administration, a
convention was signed afc London for the settlement
of all outstanding claimsbetween Great Britain and
the United States, whichfailed to receive the advice
and consent of the Senate to its ratification. The
time and the circumstances attending the negotia-
tion of that treaty were unfavorable to its accept-
ance by the people of the United States, and its pro-
visions were wholly inadequate for the settlement of
the grave wrongs that had been sustained by this- Gov
emment as well as byits citizens. The injuri-ez reunit-
ing to the United Slates by reason of the course adopted
by Great Britain dwing our late civil war in the in-
creased rates of insurance ; in the diminution of exports
and imports, and other obstructions to domestic indus-
try and production; in its effect upon the foreign com-
merceof the country; in the decrease and transfer to
Great Britain of our commercial marine; in the pro-
longation of the tour and the increased cost (both in
treasure and in lives) of its suppression could not be
adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial,claim9
which continually arise between commercial nations.
Ami yet the convention treated them simply as such
ordinary claims,from which they differ more widely in
the gravity of their character_ than in the magnitude
of their amount, great even as is that difference."
 **##**** *
" Believing that a convention thus misconceived
in its scope and inadequate in its provisions would
not have produced the hearty, cordial settlement of
pending questions, which aiono is consistent with
the relations which I desire to have firmly estab-
lished between the United States and Great Britain.
I regarded the action of the Senate, in rejecting the
treaty, to have been wisely taken in the interest of
peace, and as a necessary step in the direction of a
perfect and cordial friendship between the two conn-
trie?- A sensitive people, conscious of their power,
are more at ease under n great wrong wholly un-
atoned than under the restraint of a settlement
which sntisfies neither their ideas of j ustice nor their
grave sense of the grievance they have sustained."
Now, if in the settlement of the questions
at issue between Great Britain and this coun-
try the treaty of Washington did not contain
provisions adequate to adjust the grave wrongs
that had been sustained by this Government
as well as by its citizens, so fully set forth in
the message, then in this regard the Johnson-
Clarendon treaty was as inclusive and extensive
in its provisions as to injuries suffered at the
bands of Great Britain by citizens of the
United States as is this treaty of Washington.
In view, therefore, of these patent facts,
which have become history, can this utterance
of Sir Stafford Northcote'be credited, that any
official of the United States, or the Executive
of the United States, in any form made any
"promise" which could have informed the
understanding of the British commissioner
that our claims for such grave wrongs to the
Government, if included in the treaty of
Washington, in fact were not to be presented
to the tribunal which was by that treaty espe-
cially charged and empowered to arbitrate and
determine " all the claims growing out of the
acts committed by the aforesaid vessels, and
generically known as the Alabama claimls?"
Or can it be believed that the American
Senate, composed of almost identically the
same men who had so unanimously rejected
the Johnson-Clarendon treaty because it pro-
vided no reparation for these "grave wrongs
committed against the Government," could
with nearly the same unanimity have agreed
to advise and consent to the treaty of Wash-
ington, if the Senate had understood that these
momentous claims, the omission of which in
the one treaty had caused its rejection, were
not included in the second which it ratified ?
And a fortiori can it be for an instant credited
that any Secretary of State or commissioners
on the part of the United States will so palter
with their duty and with the nation in a
double sense as to do anything to lead an
American Senate not to place itself in a posi-
tion requiring the confession that a wrong had
been done ?
Suppose, however, another construction
may be placed upon this very remarkable
utterance of the British commissioner, that is
to say, that negotiations have _been_ subse-
quently set on foot by Great Britain in order
so to change the treaty of Washington that an
article shall be placed before the Senate so
framed that while our claims for these "grave
wrongs done to the Government" may in effect
be taken away from the tribunal at Geneva,
yet tbijit it shall be done without a confession
by the Senate that a wrong has been done by
our Government in presenting them, what
shall then be said ?
Does not the nation find itself in this posi-
tion? A treaty has been made with Our hered-
itary enemy, who has always struck us when
she thought it safe for her so to do, by which
her wrongs done to us may be adjudicated by
a high aud impartial tribunal, before which
she may be arraigned before the' civilized
world for having in our hour of peril and
trouble, for her own aggrandizement, covertly
aided our enemies with all her power, so that
our commercial marine might be transferred
to her flag; so that our commerce might be
swept from the seas; so that our misguided
enemies might disintegrate their country, and
a great rival nation broken up and blotted out
from the family of nations, and changed into a
bundle of snarling, contesting, inimical con-
federacies.
And while we are before this very tribunal,
at the bidding of the British ministry, under
menace and threats, we are called upon to
enter upon new negotiations by which we are
to surrender all that we have gained and give
up all hope of reparation for all that we have
suffered and lost; and this, too, after we have
solemnly declared to her and to the world in
so many different forms, some of which I have
just now brought to the notice of the House,
that having suffered these injuries we have in
the most official and positive manner of diplo-
matic action presented our claims upon the
British Government,and through the Executive
have laid them before the tribunal mutually
agreed upon by the parties to adjust them, and
give us such reparation ar such decision as to
justice and right shall be meet. We find our-
self peremptorily told by Great Britain that
unless we retract these our just demands, to
which we are so fully pledged, unless we make
supplemental negotiations by which we are
in fact to give them up, she will withdraw
herself from an arbitration to which she had
pledged her faith and the royal word of her
sovereign, and abandon, abrogate, and setaside
a treaty which had been duly ratified and con-
firmed by the two nations as the only hope of a
peaceful adjustment of all differences, and thus
destroy the expectations of the civilized world
that an exemplar would be furnished of the
manner in which two great nations should
arbitrate disputes instead of resorting to war,
the ultima ratio regum.
The question thus brought home to the
American nation is this: how shall this de-
mand of the British Government, enforced by
threats of broken covenant and breach of
plighted faith, be met? If in accordance with
the principles of public law we are wrong in
presenting these claims before that tribunal ;
if they can be justified upon no principle;
if, however grievous the injuries we have suf-
fered, no reparation in justice and equity ac-
cording to public law can be made, let us
waive our demands in a straightforward manly
way, acknowledge our error, and as gracefully
as we may retrace our steps, but at least com-
manding the respect of nations while we arc
so doiug. It is always magnanimous, cbivalric,
and noble in a nation to acknowledge and
retrace a wrong step taken, as it is for the
individual so to do in like case. This should
be the American way of meeting this crisis.
This we should do, if we do anything, irre-
spective of the threats of withdrawal of Great
Britain from her solemn treaty, or, when her
Government was endeavoring to coerce us
into the abandonment of claims we believed
to be just, of the menace of her minister,
