Trea0urer of the United states
Treasurer's Office, November 14,1839
Here is a plain question, easy of compreh^nsior
The Secretary of the Tiea«-ury h¿s told as, ofttn,
that the*e deposites still belonged to the General
Government He ca'ls them our deposiia , again
and again. I propose to release the States (rimal
obligation to pay back this money The dominant
party refuse to do so I make the issue with that
party: will you release the States—will you gire up
this moaey to them—will jovt pay tnem the lou- h
instalment, or will you recall the depos >es aheady
with them? II this money justly belongs to the
States, why not give it to them? But jou contend
it does not, then, assuredly, you must, when3 0u
can, take away from ihetn the money already re-
ceived Let the people understand thi . I quo'e
Mr Woodbury's own language, and I say ihe ques-
tion is correctly and fairly stated, when he, m his
annual report, December, 1839, says
"We must either provide for recalling portion cf the public
money now deposited with the tetates, or establish an adequate
system of direct taxation, or at onceresott to ihe contingent
power contemplated m the existing laws ci ncernmg he tariff
when changes become necessary for purposes of revenue, and
restore the duty on several articles of luxury now fiee '
I am willing to stand by this issue before the
people. Will you tax the S ales, oppressed as they
are with debt, to pay back the sums mentioned in
the fourth column just referred tt?
Will you brm?; upon this country the dreadful
horrors oí a system of direct taxation, with a stand-
ing army necessary to sustain it? or will you tax
luxuries imported into the ceuntry, the burden of
which the rich a'one can feel?
Mr. Chairman, I have nearly concluded. I feel
conscious ot having consumed much time. I have
done so in the discharge of my duty. For the
present, I part with the gentleman from South Ca-
rolina In discussing his opinions publicly de-
clared, I hnve not intended to use personalities I
do most cordially and from my soul abominate his
political principles. I regard members of Cor-
gress holding his opinions «is worse than Abolition-
ists. The Abolitionists, Ihe Tappan V?n Buren
Abolitionists, are a contemptible handful of de-
luded fanat>cs, ignorant of v í¡at they speak, igno-
rant of what they wish to do They are unac-
quainted with our institutions, and I believe know
little of our form of Government. But these po-
liticians who are eternally accu* ng thdr Northern
brethren with "plundering," who perpetually strive
to create dr-cord and hostiUty between different
sections, seem willing, with a knowledge of the
blessings of our Union, after having lived and
pro«per<-d   unuer it, to restroy tne most perfcet
term of Government ti e vvor'd has ever seen
Mr Cna.iman, I ngret to have percived that
one of my colleagues [Mr. Shepard] seems to
have an inclination to support some ot these opi-
nions If I could be surprised at any thin? m this
changing world, I should have been surprised at
some of his opinions He ^pokt oí the ' greedy
manufacturer ," and cf th ' tree t ode pan ," he
spoke of those who were "hungry rind thirsty after
plunder," ¡>nd intirpated ti at, while one section
might receive a "shower of go'd, another was bur-
dened and oppressed "
But \;hat added more to my surpr se was, to hear
bin oppo=" dibtr bution Ye", Mr, tae gen leman
said that ' the rorihwe tern ternuryno m le be-
lorigel to Virgi 1a than lo Crina," and he sai I he
was gl?d to see that on? in whtse opinion he had
confiderc said " *as ■•ound doc nne—he íeferred
to the vencrab'e gentleman from Maso^chu eits,
[Mr Adams] If I h'd sad thi , I rr-ight have
been .-ecu eJ of favoring \boluion But I con-
gratulate my co'Ieague that le and th  gentleman
fri m M?ssii hosetts are four.c1 asreems-, ard f must

Mj colleague said he d ' t v, th n > unkmd fee -
ir?s, bat a great chaise hi 1 com  oier gentle-
rreti " Nov, si", I tt ink he is mistaken, th-
chat ge has come over him I Ih nk he once favor-
ed <li tnbution
[Here Mi. Shepard said he should like to have
the proof tha1 he ever h-d favored cV'nbution ]
M' Stanly le^rie I to h s vo es at the extra ses-
sion, in Sep ember, 1837 <? h c he opposed the
pos pinement oí th" fourth uist Imen*, a id made a
speech upon 1'.
Mr Shepard v as understood to say thai, at hat
time, he was a very voting man, apd that he wish
ed the money paid to the Slates, bec?use he tnought
the Government did not need it And that w<.s
more Ih n thiee ye<i s pgo
Mr Stanlt said, my colleague pleads "infan-
cy,"—(some member said Trie statule of limua-
t.ons too ) No, said Mr S I kn^w he does not
intend to rely on that But, sir, the plea of "in-
fancy" cannot avail him We were both young
men then—he some years my senior, I had known
him long, he was alwa/o sagacious, shrewd, and
cool, never apt to act hastilt I h tened to his
speech with pleasure We then s'ood side by side,
denouncing corruption, and advoca mg the same
measures
It was his maiden speech.   At the risk of being
tedious I wdl read an extract    I make a long quo-
tation that I may not be accused of doing him in-
justice.
Exhact from the speecn of Mr  C   bHEFARD on the bill to
postpone thefourth instalment of the payment to the ^tafs,
delivered in the Hotit,e of Repi esentalives September 21^,
1337
1II there be a deficiencv m the Tieasury and this money
which was promised to the States could be used, H io not pro
per that it should be withheld They did not petition Congress
for this boon, cev eral of them indeed were o¡ posed to the po
hoy if t e measure and weie partially loiced into the accept
anee of their shaies but alter t ley ha 1 been led to expect this
fund and have commenced works of internal ímorovement,
ha\eíounded schools and semi lanes at d made other expendí
tures o! local importance, it 1 not just that the\ should be dis
appointed This is not a cortract which could be enfoiced n
a court of justice, but as the Governments oí (his Confederacy
were erected for the benefit of the people they should act to
wards each other with good faith and the strictest honor in or
der that confidence and harmony might be permanently esta
Wished If this instalment be not paid, some of the states may
be compelled to create stock and make loans to comply with
then engagements and here, peihaps might be another source
of derangement in the money marketmthe union
' inhonorable gentleman ftom Kentucky hassuirgesied that
the bonds of tne Bank of the I mteJ States shou'd be sold to
supply the wants of the Treasury these bonds would probably
be sought after 111 London oi Amsteidam, and then sale in Lu
lope would ha-ve a tendency to lowei the rate of exchange and
has en the return to spec e paj ments As the Government has
been hostile to that institution and i&aruons tobe freed from
all connection with banks this plan of relief 1  not < nly feasi

1 ^o patriot would attempt to distuib the compromise act
and 1, commerce veuves the 'evenue musí be greatei than a
frugal Government can expend, and it would be wiser to and-
cij ate our future income in the payment ot this instalment,
than to place in the hands of any Administration a large amount
ol money It will be used for selfish purpo¿es, more offices
will be cieated, salares will be increased, and every effort
will be made to sustain parties at the expense of the
people, or the seiamb e for appropriations will again com-
mence on this flooi—haibors for patticular sections, and
to impiove private property, creeks and livers, never be
fore heard of will again put in their claims for national
patronage Sir, in this contest for the public money, alike de-
grahng to the Representative and corrup ing to the people,
North Carolina would get but little, therefore if it is collected,
and is not wanted for the constitutional pui poses of the Govern-
ment common senst and common justice demand of me to sup
poi t an eq jitab'e distribution But is there a deficiency m the
Treasury? The honorable gentleman from Tennessee has made
a lucid statement, fron, which it would appear that theGovern
menthas ample means, the becretaiy has sent us his report,
the members of the Ways and Means have made theirs, and
they all disagree in theconclusionsat whlchthey arrive I also
have made a calculation, but,as older heads have differed, I
shall not troub e the Hou-e with my anthmetic, and I shall
con ent myself with tbe belief thai there is no need of this bill,
unti1 it is proved mote satisfactorily
Several gentlemen have indulged in sarcastic remarks on
ihe Secretaiy of the Treasury It would be nubecumingm me
to follow then example but I must say, with due respect to that
officer that he diawslargely on the patienceand generosity of
the \niencan people this country is free from de t, its cm
zens are indusiri uis and enterpnsing they have been ble sed with
íieifu seasons, and yet they have been suddenly arrested in
then career otriospeuty without foreign wat, without the oc
cunence of cxtiaoidlrarv calamity The schemes of the ¿nan
cial o(f er have signally failed and he now comes uptothie
Hiuse 0 propose ihe abandonment of a cherished policy, the
creation of a new debt, and a novel experiment upon the re
sources of the countiy Sir, if undei these ciicurastances, a
Chancelloi of the Exchequer had opened such a budget as this
to (he British Pu íamei ( hewould have been scouted, and the
Km° 3 Ministers would have though themselves well off to
have saved tl eir heads Butheie m this boasted land ofin
"t isence, the pi ople super from the knavery or ignorance of
their rules and manvagain submit to the yoke of party, and
peimit then selve to be again whee'edby artlul appeals to
then passions and n ejudiees
But sir 1 have depaited Irom OV subject I rose merely to
exoress my dissent to ü e bi 1 urder discussion, and to state
wha I cor si lei the fpphpc and interests of r*orth Carolina.
\\ h n the great qjestioi sinvolved m the President s message
are ¡ ropeilv be! jie Us 1 may again trouble the committee with
a f"\\ remaiks "
Noiv, sir, I leave it to the House to judge if my
colleague nid not favor distribution If he did not
contend th n, as I did, and do row, that the sur-
plus revenue arose from the sale of the public
'ands, did he not advocase "division,' of the reve-
nueirom lands'! D d he not support "an pquitable
distribu'ion?" If "the good faith and strictest ho.
ror" required a pajment of this land money to the
States, has tie lapse oí three years changed the na-
ture of  'good ia th and honor?"
My colleague is mistaken, sir, he has changed,
not the Whig paitj He is like ihe drunken man,
who went t) bed, and wat'ed un'il the bed turned
round aga n tha* he might lie down
My colleague told us, in conclusion, that if "the
new President should tomk and act for the whole
nation, and no' for a clque, or particular section,
no member of the House would give him a more
cordial «upport than himself" The gentleman
from South Carolina, [Mi Rhett,] one of my
colleague's ' cl que, or particular section" friends,
gave utterance to oiiething like the same senti-
ment Now I beg of them—keep away from us.
Do any thing tut oofriend us We defy your op-
position, bul fear your fnendship, it contributed
much towards b'eakir 2 down Mr. Van Buren.
IuiAIh dune, Mr Cnairman, to go into this
question of dis riLution, but I know it is needless.
It any question nas ever well discussed, this has
been. The whole argument will be found in the
celebrated report of Mr. Clay, when ihe question
first arese tor ihe examination ot Congress. In
another report, made by Mr. Ewing, the argument
was again presented with great power We have
heard it w th great abil ty from the Senate during
thii sessnn Let me tell my fnend from Virginia,
[Mr Wi«e,] in answer to his fantastic idea of
'distributing a deficiency," that we propose to dis-
tribute the pr< ceeds 0/ the sales of the public
lands, and to supply any deficiency in the Treasu-
ry b> iinpo mg duties en luxuries We impose
duties on luxuries not to distribute, but to support
Grover ment, 'to pay debts," which he admits we
have me power to do
Ihe money an mg from the sales of the public
land  we con end is a sacred fund, not to be squan-
dered by the General Government Give the pre-
cíeos to the States, it \ nl lessen executive patro-
n?ge, ihe Su'es can then, in a gieat measure, adopt
their own system of m'ernai improvements, and
keep out the hands of the General Government.
