said to cross Stone's River, and under whose command? In the event they cross, and move on the railroad at some other point, shall I move on them, leaving a section and a regiment here?

Colonel, Commanding.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN.,

February 16, 1863 - 3.45 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have as yet no reply to telegrams of 3rd and 13th, in regard to money for payment of troops. A reply is desirable, that, if we can be assured of the required amount, payment may be commenced to December 31. You will observe from dispatch of 13th that arrangements have been made to reduce amount required to $ 1,700,000.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 16, 1863.

Captain PENNOCK, Cairo:

None of the gunboat commanders have yet reported to me either their arrivals or departures, nor given me any idea of what they proposed to do or not to do. My command requires the use of these or some boats, and unless something more can be done than I have yet seen, the interest of the country will suffer very greatly. I do not hesitate to say that were it not for the hope of some more effectual co-operation, I should at once purchase common transports, and try to use them to patrol the river above Nashville, at least. Pray do not suppose I venture yet to blame the commanders of the gunboats. I cannot say what may be the preventing circumstances. But the necessities are above stated.

Major-General.

Lieutenant Fitch has gone down the river with the fleet. You can telegraph him at Clarksville or Paducah.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 16, 1863.

Lieutenant LEROY FITCH,

Commanding Gunboats, Nashville:

Have received no answer to my dispatch of last night. Will you communicate with me? It is of importance to the service that the gunboats visit Carthage immediately and destroy the boats building up Caney Fork, if possible; also that there should be a steady patrol up and down the river from Nashville, for a short time, at least.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
