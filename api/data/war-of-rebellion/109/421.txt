General GARFIELD:

I have the honor to forward a copy of a dispatch just received from Colonel Laiboldt, commanding at Bridgeport. Colonel Laiboldt has been ordered to remain and occupy Bridgeport, and, if possible, protect the remaining portion of the bridges there. Colonel Bradley will reach there to-morrow with his brigade.

STEVENSON, July 29, 1863.

General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

Arrived at Bridgeport by 6 o'clock. Cavalry scouts in both directions along river report all clear. Found at Bridgeport that the rebels took the machinery of a large steam-mill apart, carrying some pieces to the river's edge, evidently for shipment on the mentioned boat. Saw rebel sentinels on the other side of river, who after awhile fired on us. My sharpshooters drove them from this position, many taking refuge in the middle bridge and an adjoining house. A few well-directed shells made them scatter and run, and also scared away a locomotive just arriving on other side. Returned at 3 p. m., leaving a sufficient guard of cavalry. Will send topographical sketch to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. LAIBOLDT,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade.

Colonel Bradley will reach Bridgeport to-morrow. I want you to send me the result of your reconnaissance to-day.*
