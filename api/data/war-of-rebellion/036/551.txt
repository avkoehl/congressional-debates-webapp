COLUMBUS, April 20, 1863.

The enemy (some 2,000 mounted men, with four field guns) were at Pontotoc last night. My cavalry, with three guns, are moving against him.

I reported this at 2 p. m. Everything rendered possible by my limited resources will be done.

COLUMBUS, MISS., April 20, 1863.

[James M.] Burton reports that some 8,000 or 10,000 enemy's troops were at Burnsville on Thursday night with artillery, wagon train, and pontoon bridges, who stated that they would cross the Tennessee River at Eastport to join Rosecrans. There is evidently some formidable movement in that direction.
