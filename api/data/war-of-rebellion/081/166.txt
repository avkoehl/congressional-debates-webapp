Following telegraphed for your information:
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-[1.10 p.m.].

General MEADE:

General Barlow does not connect with the right of General Burnside, and the report is that Barlow has not advanced, so that the enemy hold the railroad cut on the right of the Ninth Corps. General Burnside would like Barlow to advance, as they have a cross-fire on Willcox.

W. W. SANDERS,Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

SECOND CORPS, June 18, 1864-1.55 p.m.

General MEADE:

The attack under General Gibbon was unsuccessful. I will reform and organize for another later in the day, selecting another brigade. The assault was not a spirited one, but the enemy's position was strong. I will seek another front. I hold advanced ground and have gained a good crest for artillery, which is in position.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
