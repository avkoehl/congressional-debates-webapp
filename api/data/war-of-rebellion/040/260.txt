Can you not get in the rear of the rebel force and cut off their retreat? They are reported to have reached Rowlesburg and Oakland.

BUCKHANNON, VA., April 26, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

Received your telegram. The Second [West] Virginia Regiment, with two companies of cavalry and two pieces of artillery, have just reached me, having retreat from Beverly on Friday night, by way of Philippi. I have here now the Second Virginia, the Eighth Virginia, that has just reached me from Bulltown, and Twenty-eighth Ohio. The forced marches of the Virginia regiments, on the worst roads I ever saw, have broken them down, and they came without transportation that I directed to come by way of Weston.

The Third Virginia is between Bulltown and here, and will be here to-morrow by noon. I shall move three regiments and three guns from here toward Beverly Tuesday morning; at the same time Colonel Mulligan will move from Philippi, and I expect to capture all Imboden's and Jackson's forces. For want of horses and forage, I cannot move earlier.

B. S. ROBERTS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BUCKHANNON, VA., April 26, 1863.

General KELLEY,

Commanding Harper's Ferry:

I just received a dispatch from Clarksburg, reporting that at 11.30 p.m. the enemy were at Rowlesburg.

B. S. ROBERTS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
