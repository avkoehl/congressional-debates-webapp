RICHMOND, May 19, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Raleigh:

In reply to your telegram of the 16th in regard to amnesty oaths, I have to state that I permit all persons who are included in President Lincoln's amnesty proclamation to take that oath, unless there is a special reason for governing the particular case. Those not included in the amnesty proclamation are permitted to take the oath of allegiance and petition to the President for individual pardon. The President alone can act on such petitions. It is understood that a new amnesty proclamation is soon to be issued.
