PONTOON BRIDGE, May 15, 1864-6 p. m.

General MACKALL,

Chief of Staff, Army of Tennessee:

GENERAL: There is a very good crossing at this place now for every arm of the service. The engineer officer in charge is still improving it. I had an order this evening from the general commanding, through Colonel Hays, to allow no wagons to pass at this point until after night-fall, but to place them under cover and out of view of the enemy. This I did, except so far as the ambulances bearing the sick and wounded are concerned. I have permitted them to pass back and forth.

Very respectfully,

POLLOK B. LEE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Tennessee.

ROME, May 15, 1864.
