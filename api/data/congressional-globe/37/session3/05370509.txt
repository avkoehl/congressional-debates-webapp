1863.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
The only reason why I offered it was that the bill
itself provides that the salaries are to be paid out
of the moneys they collect, and thatatsome time,
either in the appropriation bill or elsewhere, some
provision must be made. I shall not insist on
it being made here; but, as a matter of course, I
shall ask that it may go on an appropriation bill,
and thereby appropriate the money to pay their ij
salaries. h
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator ;j
withdraw his amendment? J,
Mr. DOOLITTLE. No, sir, not the entire jj
amendment. I am willing, if that be the sense of ,
the Senate, to withdraw that portion relating to jj
their salaries. i!
Mr. SUMNER. When the Senator proposed j|
that amendment, it seemed to me, and I suggested 'j
to him, that it was a departure from the policy of i|
the Government. I am notawate that any pub- ji
lie officers are allowed to take out of moueys they j|
receive their own salaries. For instance, no ofii- ji
cer under the internal revenue law, or under our j{
tariff law, no custom-house officer, is authorized H
to detain his salary. He must pay over every- ■!
thing he receives to the Government; his salary |i
is provided for by the appropriation bills; and it i!
strikes me we should not make an exception in this i;
case. These gentlemen should be provided for, j;
as the Senator suggests, in the appropiuuion bills. ;i
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will then accept the sug- j!
gestion, and have stricken out that portion of the i|
amendment which provides for paying their sala- ji
ries. jj
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amendment !j
will be so modified. j1
Mr. GRIMES. It seems to me that the effect jj
of the amendment will be, if adopted, to allow i!
these officers to audit their own accounts, it vir-
tually puts the whole thing into the hands of these .;
•officers, whatever they may be called, and allows \
them to decide for themselves whether or not any
item of expense is necessary or otherwise. If they ,|
decide in their own favor, they take that amount j,
out of the money in their hands, which they have 1
received from this property, and pay for the ser- \\
vice. I think the whole thing is a departure from |
the practice of the Government. jj
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will not insist upon the !
amendment; for I do not desire toenfei on a change
of the policy of the Government. 1 feel the force \
of the suggestion of the honorable Senator from j1
Iowa. ;■
The VICE PRESIDENT. Docs the Senator }\
withdraw the amendment? i(
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will withdraw it. b
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended, >i
and the amendment was concurred in; the bill was '[
ordered to be engrossed for a third reading; and 'j
it was read the third time, and passed. ;i
On motion of Mr. SUMNER, the title of the \
bill was amended so as to read: 44 An act to amend
an act entitled ' An act for the collection of direct
taxes m insurrectionary districts within the Uni- jj
ted States, and for other purposes,"' approved !i
June 7, 1862. j!
INDEMNITY FOR INDIAN DEPREDATIONS. jj
Mr. HENDERSON. I desire to move that !l
the Senate postpone all piior orders for the pur- |i
pose of taking up House bill No. (i34, giving Aid 1
to the State of Missouri for the purpose of recur- '
ingthe abolishment of slavery in scad State.
Mr. WILKINSON. 1 hope that motion will
not prevail. I gave way to allow the hill which :
has just been passed to be considered. These
bills relating to the Indians of Minnesota should
certainly be taken up m preference to anything ■
else. The bill which the Senator proposes to take
up must necessarily lead to debate, and will take
a long time. I hop^, therefore, the motion will be ,
voted down.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. If thp honorable Senator
from Minnesota will ailow me, I w?.s going to ap-
peal to my friend ftum Missouri to allow nv to
take up the bill referred to by the Senator from
Minnesota. I do not think it, wll take half an .
hour to dispose of it. It was mad' a special order 1
for disposition last week, but has been laid aside, [
and some other bills have come up, wliMi have '
taken an extraordinary length of time, and l-a\e '
displaced it. I do not think it will take ov^r half .
an hour to dispose of it.
Mr. HENDERSON. I had this bill up ten days !
ago, and I have on several occasions tiled to get i
it before the Senate, but have yielded to the wishes
of other Senators. I dislike very much to resist
an appeal of this character, and I shall yield with
the distinct understanding that my friend will
assist mo in getting it up at some other time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
withdraw his motion?
Mr. HENDERSON. Yes, sir.
Mr. WILKINSON. I move to take up House
bill No. 582.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate as in
Committee of the Whole resumed the considera-
tion of the hill (II. R. No. 582) for the relief of
persons for damages sustained by reason of depre-
dations and injuries by certain bands of Sioux
Indians; the pending question being on the amend-
ment reported from the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs, to strike out the whole of the original bill,
and to insert the following in lieu thcieof:  
Wheieas the United States heretofore became bound by
UCiity stipulations to the Si-s>cton, W.ihpatou, Mcdaw akim- j!
ton, and VWihpakootu band- ot the Dakota or Sioux htdt- jj
mi** to pay sums of money and annuities, the gi eater '[
pottioti ot which remains unpaid aeeouling to the tonus of i j

a lai^e amount of jflopoity, and theiebj have foifoiled all >,
ju^t claim to the said nn>n^\s and annuities to the United j1

may be necessary to pay the same.
Sec. {>. Jlnd he it further cnacted, That tho Secietary of
the Interior, immediately after the passage of this act, shall
cause the same to be published in four of the newspapers
of the State of Minnesota which, in fif* opinion, will give
the mos-i publicity to the same among the people who have
suffered by said depted.ttions, and give notice of the first
meeting of said commissioners the expenses to be paid out
of the sum appropriated in the next preceding section. '
iSto. 7. And be it further enacted, That if tiie complain-
ant oi any willies'?'testifying before said commissioners
shall he guilty of peijuiy, upon conviction thereof iu the
proper court of the United States, he shall suffer the pain|
and penalties prescribed by the laws of the United States
lor that oflense.
Src. 8 *dnd be it further enacted, That the Secretary of
the Interior Is herein* authorized to set apart of the public
lands not otherwise appropnated. one hundred and sixty
actes in severalty to each individual of the before-named
hand? who excited themselves in ic.scuinj* the whites from
the late tnassacie of'caid Indians. And there shall be an-
nually paid to each of said Indians, po lonp as he or she shall
live, the sum ot fifty dollars*. The land so set apart shall
not bo subject to any tax, forfeiting, or sale, by process of
law, and shall not be aliened oi devi>cd, except by the con-
sent of ^c Piesident of the United States, but shall be an
lnhentaffe to said Indians and their bears forever.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Anthokt
in tiicchnir.) The question is on agreeing to the
amendment in tho form of a substitute which haa
just been read.
Mr. WILKINSON. I suppose it is proper to
perfect the substitute before the vote is taken upon
it. I move, in section two, line eleven, ufter the
word " troops," to insert the words, " defending
in behalf," so that it will read," or by the troops
defending in behalf of the United States/' &c.
The reason for that is this: many of these troops,
although they had been recruited, had not been
regularly mustered into the service of the United
States until after the war had progressed some
time. I hope there will be no objection to the
amendment.
The amendment to the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WILKINSON. I offer another amend-
ment, to add the following as additional sections
to the bill:
,/lnd be it further cnacted. That the said commissioners
may make l ule> not iueoiiMs-tont with tin* act prescribing
the outer and modi' of piesenting. pio^eeutmij, and proving
said elaniH hetoie ihein, which iule< shall be published in
one iK'vvs-papci mtheeiu ot bt l'aul and one in St. Peters
foi at h;ar-t t'wo wreks puoi to the hot session of said eoin-
nn-sion, to be held at St as ditected in the fourth
-ection of this act, and the <!xp" v*e of ntch publication
vball be paid out of the fund appiopuatcd in the fifth section
of thr; act.
And he it farther cnacted, That powersof attorney which
may be  ivvn toi tho pio^eciition and collection of cl.iiws
uudei lin^aet slial! not he subject to any duty under the
{Tnited ^rate^ internal revenue law, except that to each of
said power* shall be afiived one or more legal stamps de-
noting a dutv of ten cent?., and the ceinfieate of acknowl-
edgment oi f'uither anthentt^ation ot such power shall rc-
qnne no fiuthei .-tamp whatevei.
The first of these sections relates merely to the
publication of rules by the commission. To that
I suppose there will oe no objection. The last
section relates to stamp dunes. Necej>sati!y a great
many of those el dims will be small, and it seems
to tne it would be very onerous to charge each of
these claimants a dollar or two dollars, which is
provided by the revenue laws for powers of attor-
ney of this kind. 1 therefore take the stampof the
smallest amount winch is included in the internal
tevenue lav/ as necessary for powers of attorney.
Mr. FKS8KNDKJN". I should like to have that
last section read again. ^
The Serrefnry lead it.
Mr. FESvSENDKN. I hope tho Senator will
withdraw th.it siction. As the law now stands
the '-hem^e is onedolur. It is too much, and wa
design to ( hong;e it m a general bill at this session.
Then is a lull being ptenared in the House of Rep-
resentatives with reilrenee to necessary amend-
ments to tin5 tax law, and that is one of them. Xf
it is not put in m the House, it can be insertedin
the bill in the Senate. As it nowsiands the charge
is altogether too hi^h. We have already post-
poned the operation of the law, so far as regards
invaliding th« instruments is concerned, until
the 1st of March; and when the bill to which I
have referred comes in here, I design to have an
alteration made in reference to this subject._ But
what 1 object to is making any distinction m the
same class of cases. It will lead to very great dif-
ficulty - ud eotifnaion; and as we deem the charge
