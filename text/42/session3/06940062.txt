erativein grazing and farming than in mining.
The copper mines of Carroll, richer than
those of Cornwall, yield an average from good
and bad ores of thirty-two per cent, of metallic
copper, yet they are not Worked. The ores
at present have to be hauled twenty-five miles
to the Virginia and Tennessee railroad, thence
shipped by rail to Norfolk, where they are
transferred to vessels; whereas with New river
improved and the James River and Kanawha
canal completed, these ores would be within
ten miles of water transportation to the mar-
kets of the world. But iron is the miueral to
which attention is being chiefly directed. The
extent and richness of the iron ores of south-
west Virginia render them of great value.
General Haupt, chief engineer of the Shenan-
doah Valley Railroad Company, in his report
in 1871, speaking of the iron upon the line of
the proposed extension of that road, which
crosses New river in Giles county, says:
"The-iron deposits are very numerous and of
superior quality. Pennsylvania, rich as she is, is
poor in iron ores as compared with Virginia."
This remark of General Haupt applies with
peculiar truth to the counties of West Vir-
ginia and Virginia lying upon and drained by
New river. For years furnaces and forges
have been worked in some of these counties,
but only to a limited extent; still, in the face
of the high freights on heavy tonnage, the high
prices of iron have given quite an impetus to
the manufacture of iron, and, within the last
year or two, many new furnaces have been
erected, and the quantity of iron produced
greatly increased. But this great field of
industry, which has made Pennsylvania rich,
is only in its infancy in Virginia. Let the
James River and Kanawha canal be com-
pleted, and the Shenandoah Valley railroad
constructed, then the valley of New river
will have four outlets: first, the Atlantic,
Mississippi, and Ohio railroad; second, the
Shenandoah Valley railroad; third, the Ches-
apeake and Ohio railroad ; and fourth, the
James River and Kanawha canal. With these
outlets to the heavy freight of the New river
valley, the consequent choice of routes, and
the competition that would naturally follow,
the trade of that country would enjoy the rich
rewards of cheap transportation. Business
interests that have heretofore lain dormant
will spring into active life, and the ascending
smoke of a thousand furnaces will mark this
rapid development.
At present the only outlet for the trade of
most of the New river valley, in the State of
Virginia, is the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio
railroad, and which is wholly insufficient for
the purpose. The improvement of New river
would give at least one other outlet by tapping
the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad at the
mouth of Greenbrier. The value of this road
for heavy freights will be appreciated when it
is remembered that the maximum grade going
east is only twenty-nine and a halt feet to the
mile. During the last year many tons of iron
and zinc ore lay for weeks at the railroad depots
awaiting transportation, due to the heavy de-
mand upon the company for the transportation
of through freights.
From January 1, 1872, to January 1, 1873,
there was shipped, or remaining on hand
awaiting transportation, of pig iron and bloom
iron, from the counties of Wythe and Pulaski
alone, as follows:
Pounds.
Wytheville  2,518,500
Max Meadow    2,409,335
Dublin 17,518,380
N ew Eiver  44.800
22,521,015
And from Max Meadow, zinc ore  4,897,870
Total 27,418,885
This does not include the lead from the
Union Lead mines, which amounts to many
tons. Mr. Edward Shelley, a real estate agent,
whose business has lead him thoroughly to
examine into the agricultural and mineral
resources of southwest Virginia, and whose
experience in the iron business makes him
competent to speak, closes an article on the
subject, as follows:
" I estimate that not less than five hundred tons a
week or twenty-five thousand tons a year of pig
iron will be made when all the furnaoes are in blast,
which will be worth fifty dollars a ton, or $1,250,000,
besides the value of lead, zinc, and agricultural
produce."
This remark about the production of pig
iron was made with reference only to the
furnaces already at work in the counties of
Wythe and Pulaski, or in process of construc-
tion.
_ That iron ores exist here in untold quanti-
ties, and that the improvement of New river
would rapidly develop this great interest, no
one can doubt. On the upper waters of New
river, where the improvement is proposed,
they have to rely on charcoal for smelting.
Op the lower waters of New river, in West
Virginia, coal of the finest quality is found in
great abundance. With the river opened to
steamboat navigation, we should have the
coal and iron brought in connection, and thus
these two great elements of wealth would be
utilized and made productive. The commer-
cial value of the James River and Kanawlui
canal, with New river as a feeder, no one well
informed can deny. That the Government is
abuudantly able to make these improvements is
equally true. The construction of the James
River and Kanawha canal gives an outlet by
water to 16,500 miles of internal navigation,
and would be an annual saving of at least
$40,000,000 to the trade of the West. Not
only by the extent of the connections, but by
the trade, are these works national aud proper
subjects for Government aid.
But were I speaking for Virginia alone, I
would still maintain upon a principle of equity
and justice that the Government should not
only complete the water line to the Missis-
sippi, but also improve the bed of New river.
Let us consider briefly how the account
stands upon the score of benefits received be-
tween Virginia and the Federal Government.
In the first place, the State of Virginia ceded the
territory northwest of the Ohio as a gracious
gift to the nation ; an area of about 206,640,-
000 acres of the finest lands upon the continent.
This cession was made in deference to the
wishes of the other States, and in a spirit of
conciliation, but it was a condition that the
lands so coded should be held as a trust and
disposed of for the common use and benefit
of all the States. How far this trust has been
faithfully executed, let a few facts show. In
the States that have been carved out of this
northwest territory, Congress, from the year
1827 to June 30, 1G71, has granted public
lauds for canal purposes as follows:
Acres.
Indiana  1,439,279
Ohio  1,100,361
Illinois    290,915
Wisconsin  325,431
Michigan  1,250,000
Total  4.405,986
And during the same time Congress has
granted for railroad and military wagon-road
purposes as follows:
A. CV
Illinois  2,595,053
Wisconsin  4,631,271
Michigan  6,649.774
Total 13,876,098
Grantedl'orcanals, asstated above  4,405,986
Total  18,282.084
And yet when has Virginia, that ceded this
vast domain to the Government, received one
acre for internal improvements? She was once
bounteous to the Government. Will the Gov-
ernment now, when she no longer has the
means of making these improvements, step in
and render this valuable service to Virginia,
and at the same time to the whole country?
But these are not the only States that have
received land grants for railroads and wagon-
roads. The following statement, taken from
the Land Office report for 1871, will show the
quantity granted for such purposes :

By reference to the report of the Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue (1872) it will be
seen that while the total internal revenue for
1870 was $167,560,307 49, the State of Vir-
ginia paid $5,496,351 39 ; and that while she
is the eleventh State in the order of the popula-
tion, she was the eighth State in the payment
of internal revenue.
In 1871 the internal revenue collected was
$127,873,109 23, and Virginia paid $5,319,-
272 69, being the seventh State in the pay-
ment of revenue.
In 1872 the revenue collected was $115,-
299,061 48,_ and Virginia paid $4,939,027 93,
still remaining seventh in payment of revenue.
But this statement does not present, in its
true light, the value of Virginia production
and labor to the Federal Treasury, and the
amount of revenue which she in effect pays.
