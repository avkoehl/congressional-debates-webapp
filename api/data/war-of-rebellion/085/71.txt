GENERAL: I have reliable information that fifty guerrillas camped seven miles north of this place last night. Captain Todd is in command. I also learn from the mail carrier that forty guerrillas passed south of Waverly on their way to Jackson County, Mo. I hear of other bands prowling around in this county. I have sent all my available force with Captain Bingham, to Boonville, for his arms, and I have not enough of mounted me to send in pursuit of them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
