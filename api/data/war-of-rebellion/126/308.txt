Numbers 35. DIVISION OF REGULAR SUPPLIES, QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., October 17, 1865.

Bvt. Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C:

GENERAL: In compliance with General orders, Numbers 39, Quartermaster-General's Office, July 1, 1865, I have the honor to submit the following as my personal report for the year ending June 30, 1865:

My report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was transmitted to the Quartermaster-General November 28, 1864.

At the commencement of the fiscal year of 1864-"65 I was on duty in the city of New York, under my commission as captain and assistant quartermaster engaged in the purchase, procurement, and shipment of forage.

September 7, 1864, in accordance with the law of July 4, 1864, reorganizing the Quartermaster's Department, I was assigned to duty in charge of the Fifth Division of the Quartermaster- General's Office, with the rank of colonel, to date from August 2, 1864.

September 8, 1864, Special Orders, Numbers 298, Adjutant- General's Office, directed that I should turn over my property and duties in New York City, under such instructions as might be given me by the Quartermaster-General, and report in person to him and enter upon my duties as chief of the Fifth Division of the Quartermaster-General's Office.

The fact that I was supplying forage for the entire armies of the East and the Atlantic and Gulf sea-coast depots, and the importance of keeping up the supply, in the opinion of the Quartermaster-General justified my remaining in New York and giving my personal attention to these shipments until January 1, 1865, at which time I reported in person to the Quartermaster- General and entered upon my duties as chief of the division of the Quartermaster General's Office.

Preparatory to my departure from New York City, Captain E. D. Champ, assistant quartermaster, was, by Special Orders, Numbers 395, Adjutant-General's Office, November 12, 1864, directed to repair at once to New York City-this order relieving him from duty at Saint Louis, Mo.-and relieve me from my duties as forage officer; and I was by the same order directed on being relieved, to report to the Quartermaster-General in person.

December 20, 1864, I turned over to Captain Chapman all the quartermaster's property for which I was responsible and, as before stated, entered upon my duties in charge of the Fifth Division of the Quartermaster-General's Office, where I still remain.

The Schedules A, C, CC, D and G, and the statement of public moneys called for by General Orders, Numbers 39, are hereto attached.
