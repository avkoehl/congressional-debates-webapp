When moved you will pass through this place and go in the direction of Houston. Boats have been ordered to Minden to transport your division. Further and fuller instructions will be sent you to-morrow.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. S. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, January 21, 1865.

Major General, JOHN A. WHARTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the general commanding to write you as follows: The movement of the enemy's troops down the Mississippi and the concentration of a large force at New Orleans, with other information received, indicate an intention on the part of the enemy immediately to assume the offensive. An effective force of at least 30,000, including A. J. Smith's corps, from Nashville, is available for this purpose. An attempt in force is about being made against either Mobile or the Texas coast, while a formidable naval expedition ascends Red River. Keep your command in readiness to move promptly, as circumstances may require, either toward Houston, Sabine Pass, or Natchitoches. The roads, especially that toward Houston, should be examined and provision made for crossing streams, so that your march may be as expeditions as possible. Major-General Walker will be instructed to notify you of the enemy's appearance on the coast. You will be directed to march to the support of General Buckner or of General Walker, as may be determined by the movements of the enemy's land forces. Forney's division is ordered to Texas.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, January 22, 1865.

Major General J. H. FORNEY,

Commanding Division, Minden:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you move your division as rapidly as possible to this place. You will select for the artillery battalion under your command two batteries to accompany the division to Texas. These two batteries should be carefully chosen with a view to their efficiency for service and the condition of the horses. I am also instructed to inform you that three boats have been ordered to Minden to assist in transporting to this point the heavy baggage and the two batteries of your command. The road through the Red River bottom is certainly impracticable for loaded wagons and probably so for empty ones. Such as cannot be transported in the boats had better be sent here by way of Bellevue and Benton. The road from Fillmore to Bellevue, by way of Mr. Hutchinson's, is in good condition. Three hundred Enfield rifles now here will be turned over to the unarmed men of your division upon its arrival at this place.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
