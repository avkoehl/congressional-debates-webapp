§90                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                              May 15,
State was inte sted—would be disposed of be-
fore the 16th of June, but he could perceive no
necessity on the part of the Housefor committing
itself as to the precise day at this time
Mr BURD addressed the Houseat considerable
length, and was understood to support the motion
for postponement
Mr CAMBRELENG was quite as anxious as
the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Johnson]
could be to terminate the session But when gen-
tlemen recur to the situation of a portion of the
impoitant subjects which demand the attention of
Congress, they will be satisfied that the period
has not yet arrived for fixing the time of adjourn-
ment It should be recoiled ed that the message
of the President, sent to the House at the com
mencement of the session, was still in Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union It had
been stated that the majority of the Bouse was
lesponsible for the transaction of public business
If so, the maioiity should beware of fixing the
day of adjournment before the necessary business
could be completed
After some further remarks from Messrs.
BOON, EW1NG-, and BURGES,
Mi. WAYNE said, the question was one upon
which no difference of opinion ought to exist
What were the facts as to the situation of the busi-
ness of the House' He had taken pains to make
an abstract from the records, and it appeared that
478 bills had been ongmated,and were now ready
for the disposal of the House, 182 had been defi-
nitely acted on by the House, and 34 bills fiom
the Senate had been acted on Theie was,there-
fore, no ground for any imputation of negligence
upon the House. As to the discussions upon the
great principles of our Givernment, he neither
expected nor desired that they should cease It
was obvious, from the history of our Government,
that the practical operation of every provision
in the Constitution was not entirely foreseen
Discussion upon these subjects wa', in his opinion,
exceedingly profitable, and though he diffeied
fiom many gentlemen in the views they had ex
piessed, he hoped their arguments would convince
the country that the public time devoted to them
had not been improperly spent He believed the
jjeoplehad regarded them with interest, and would
fully sustain the decision of the House upon
them Our fiee institutions require that the fullest
discussion should be given to such topics There
weieseveral measures before both Houses of Con
press which requned its action before a final de
cisión on (he ques'ion of adjournment could with
propriety be taken
Mr LANE said he regretted to differ in opinion
with gentlemen with whom he usually acted, and
none more so than bis honorable colleague, who
had introduced the i evolution
Sir, (said Mr L ,) did he consult his own wishes
or interest, he would vote foi the earliest possible
day of adjournment But there were (said Mi L)
considerations of a higher eharactei than private
interest or desu es—the public good
Mr L eaidhe would not deteiminetlie question
of adjournment by what had been done m the busi-
ness of legislation, but from what remained to be
done for the public and private interest A post
ponementof the resolution does not, as some gen-
tlemen had considered, necessarily extend the
period contemplated by the resolution foi the close
of the session On thecontmrythe House will then
be able to act more advisedly upon the question
Mr L said, no western gentleman could, in his
opinion, consistently with the interest of his con
stituents, vote for the resolution, when not a bill
m which the West was interested had yet been
acted upon Sir, the bill to reduce and graduate
the price of the public lands—a bill in which the
western people had more at stake, and felt a moie
lively interest in than any othei—is undecided
There is another bill, until acted upon, he would
nevei agree to leave the House—the one reported
by the Committee of Ways and Means in relation
to the public deposites Every consideration of
public duty required action upon the subj ct
There was (said Mi L ) another objection By
the passage of this resolution the House placed
itself in the power of the Senate, to do which he
would not consent, however great his confidence
n that body might be, while so many bids of vast
importance remained to be disposed of
Mr VANDERPOEL said he was sorry that
he could not vote for the motion of his friend and
colleague, [Mr Caiibreleng,] for whose opinions
and views upon this floor he cherished that re
spect* which was due tn much greater experience
in matters of legisl-tion than he (Mr V ) could
boast, but he (Mr V ) was decidedly in favor of
fixing upon some day certain for the adjournment
of Congress Mr V would not say thathe would
prefer the day proposed by the resolution to anv
other day, eailieror moie remote, but he believed
that it would conduce to the acce'eration of the
public business, to the dispensation with, or, at all
events, to the abbreviation of many speeches with
which gentlemen were still laden, if we now pre-
scribed to ourselves a certain period within which
om duties here must be executed We would
then be more apt to stop speaking, when we had
finished thinking, and would, practically, pay
more respect than we hod been accustomed to pay
to the maxim, that " brevity is the soul of wit "
After all, (said Mr V ,) with all our vaunted wis-
dom, we are nothing, Mr Speaker, but full-grown
boys, and all experience teaches us that boih boys
and men will invariably execute more v ithm a
gnen period, when they are stinted, than when
they are at liberty to dispose of matters at their
leisure, and if we fix upon a day when our lal o-s
heie are to terminate, we will inevitably redouble
om diligence, and accomplish all that the interest
of our constituents requires us to execute
The gentleman from Georgia [M>- WAVNE]has,
to be sure, presented us with a pretty formidable
calendar of unfinished business, and pi otests, at the
same time, against the inference that we have not
hitherto been diligent Mi V said he should not
regret it if we were to go home without acting
upon a majonty of those bills, that he had long
believed that excessive legislation in this country
was an evil, and that, as an oidmaty rul°, if a
balance were struck at the end of each session, the
sins of commission of legislative bodies would
much overbalance their sins of omission Mi V
said he was happy to perceive, from recent indica-
tions here, that there was a grov mg disposition
to go about and execute the business that ourcon-
stituents sent us heie to tiansact, instead of spend-
ing the time with interminable panic speeches
Yes, (said Mi V ,) it has become rather an uphill
business to make a panic speech here now, and
he congratulated the House that this standing dish,
this commonplace and stale chowder of panic and
distress, and the removal of the deposites, liad
ceased to be palatable to any portion of the House
it was a most auspicious omen, and proved that
we were disposed to do what was most loudly
required of us As to finishing the general orders,
and e\ecut.ng all the business, (said Mr V ,; we
could not do it if we should sit here till next
March If we entertained such a hope, we would
find that the tnd of our race would be like the
horizon—constantly receding fiom us Would
the numerous little mills we had heie, called com-
mittees, cease to grind out the r grists' Would
the number of petitions foi further legislation cease
if we sat heie ti'l doomsday '                              .
Mr BROWN said, if he saw any prospect that
the discussion would be brought to a close before
the usual! oui of adjournment, he ceitamly should
not detain the House fiom moie important busi
ness His opinion had been made up fiom the
commencement, and he had th  same desire which
influenced other gentlemen, that his reasons for
that opinion should accompany his vote He was
most anxious to bring the business of the session
to a close, aid return to his family, and no one
could personally hive less to gain Dy postponing
the period of adjournment than he had The
close of a session of Congress, supposed by many
to be one of the most important since the organ-
ization of the Government, was a question in
which public duty rnu^t prevail over private srrat-
fication It was almost file weeks to the 16 h of
June, the day of adjournment named in the reso
lution, and if we refused to postpone, and adopted
the resolution, it was an act which we could not
recall, and we therebv put ourselves entirely in
the power of the other branch of the Legislature,
who might, or might not, concur with us, as its
members saw fit His objection was not to the
proposed time of adjournment, (he hoped and
believed the House would be in a situation to
adj urn by the 16th o*" Tune,) his objection was to
fixirg the day five weeks in advance, when the
time could be determined two weeks hence, with
far greater safety to the public interest than at this
moment Public events of gieat magnitude and
moment might occur in the course of two weeks,
which might lead us to legret oui hasty and pre-
mature action Gentlemen had intimated their
determination not to adjourn until something shall
be done to íe'iete the country This idea of re-
lieving the country so often repeated and reiterated,
both here and elsewhere, was quite a vexed ques-
tion, upon which a wide difference of opinion pre-
vailed, and probably would prevail, until it was
finally and effectually decided (as he trusted it
would be) by the people If gentlemen meantby
" re! levmg th e cou n try," a restore tion of th e publ ic
deposites, or a rechaiter of the Bank of the United
States, he would ask, what hope was there of
accomplishing either of those purposes short of a
new expiession of the pooular will' What hope
was there of reversing the opinions and votes of
those who, in resisting both those measures, be-
lieved, and honestly believed, they were fulfilling
an obligation which they owed to their constitu-
ents and the country, and which would ultimately
be sanctioned and sustained by the voice of public
approbation' He would not transgiess the order
of tne Hoase by departing from the question of
postponement under consideration He would
therefore vote for the motion of his honorablecol-
league, [Mr Cambreleng,] m the hope that, at
the expiration of two weeks, the day of adjourn-
ment might be settled for the ICtn of June, the
ear'lest day proposed.
Mr HARDIN did not assent to the statement
of his colleague, [Mr Lane,] that the responsi-
bility of not acting upon the measures before the
House rested upon the majority Upon a gieat
portion of the most important questions, nothing
of party was involved, and the responsibility of
neglecting such measures rested upon both sides.
A further explanation was made by Messrs.
EWING, BOON, and BURGES
Mr WA RD was in favor of adjourning at the
earliest possible day, but it was impossible to say
whether the essential business could be completed
by the 16th of next month The most impoitant
business was generally postponed until near the
end of the session Investigation and arrangement
was necessary before business could go forward
Twelve days before the close of the last session,
only ten bills had been passed On the last day,
one hundred bills weie passed
Afteraremark from Mr BEARDSLEYagainst
the motion to postpone, the question was taken,
and carried by the following vote
