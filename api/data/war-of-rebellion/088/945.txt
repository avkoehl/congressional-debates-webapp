GENERAL ORDERS. HDQRS. FIRST DIV., FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 53. September 20, 1864

The general commanding has noticed the fact that some regiments of this command have sent their colors to the rear during engagements with the enemy, the very occasion when they should bear them unfurled, protect and defend them. Every regiment should consider it vital to its honor to guard and defend its colors to the last extremity through every peril. It is directed, therefore, in future that each regiment bear its colors when in battle line on the field of action as well as at other times.

By command of Brigadier-General Griffin:

GEO. MONTEITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General..
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 20, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have the honor to report all quiet on my front during the last twenty-four hours.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 20, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you relieve the line of cavalry pickets from a point south of the Gurley house to the plank road in the vicinity of the church. General Warren will relieve them from his left to a point south of the Gurley house, the point of union of your picket to be mutually agreed upon. General Hancock will take up the line at or near the plank road. The change is to be made immediately.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 20, 1864-3.45 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The cavalry picket-line is at least two miles in front of our line, through the Williams house. Do you mean that we should relieve the cavalry in the line they now occupy, or take up a better line for infantry, so that the cavalry may retire?

Very respectfully,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
