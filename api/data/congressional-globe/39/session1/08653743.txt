S. C. POMEROY,
B. GRATZ BROWN,
UEORSfi RliAD RIDDLE,
Managers on the part of the Senate.
BENJAMIN F. LOAN,
SIDNEY CLARKE,
CHARLES A. ELDRIDSE,
Managers on the part of the Home.
Mr. LOAN. I deem it necessary only to
say to the House in explanation of this report,
that the committee of conference agreed to
take substantially the first two sections of the
Senate bill and the last section of the House
bill and make of them a new bill, with this
single exception, that the conterminous prin-
ciple, as it is called, contained in the Senate
bill has been added to the House bill. It is
simply the bill as it passed the House with the
first two sections of the Senate bill substituted
for the first two sections of the House bill,
with the conterminous principle, as it is called,
of the Senate bili added to the House bill. I
call the previous question on the report of the
committee of conference.
The previous question was seconded and tlie
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the report of the committee of
conference was agreed to.
Mr. LOAN moved to reconsider the vote by
which the report of the*- committee of confer-
ence was adopted; and also moved to lay the
motion to reconsider upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
election contest again.
The Ilonse resumed the consideration of
the contcsted-election case of Smith Fuller vs.
John L. Dawson, of the twenty-first congres-
sional district of the State of Pennsylvania,
upon which Mr. Paine, from the Committee
of Elections, had submitted a report in favor
of the sitting member.
Mr. PAINE. The chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Post Office^ and Post Roads [Mr.
Alley] seems to think it a hardship that he
should be robbed of the morning hour to-day,
and therefore I promised to move that this
case be postponed until after the expiration
of the morning hour to-day. But I would not
have made that promise if I could have fore-
seen that an hour and a half would have been
taken up by other business. But having made
the promise, I will move to postpone the fur-
ther consideration of this subject until after
the expiration of the morning hour to-day.
The motion to postpone was agreed to.
organization and instruction of militia.
Mr. PAINE. Before the morning hour com-
mences, I ask unanimous consent to introduce
for consideration at this time a joint resolution
recommending the organization and instruc-
tion of the militia by the several States, and
providing for the distribution of ordnance and
ordnance stores.
No objection was made.
The joint resolution was read a first and
second time.
The joint resolution was read at length. It
provides that in order to preserve and perpetu-
ate the military knowledge now possessed by
the people of the United States, and to render
useful to some extent the large amount of
ordnance and ordnance stores that have been
accumulated by the Government of the United
States, it is for the interest of the Republic
that, until a uniform militia system shall have
been adopted by Congress, the several States
and Territories should thoroughly organize,
arm, equip, and instruct the miiitia in accord-
ance with their own laws ; and such organiza-
tion, arming, equipment, and instruction is
hereby recommended to the several States and
Territories. _
The second section provides that two thirds
of all the ordnance and ordnance stores of each
and every kind now in the possession of the
United States, excepting only such as may be
required for the Navy or the permanent lortin-
cation of the country, shall bs distributed by
the Secretary of War to the several States and
Territories and to the District of Columbia, at
the expense of the United States, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the act of April 3,
1808, entitled "An act making provisions for
arming and equipping the whole body of the
militia of the United States," and the act of
March 3,1855, entitled " An act making appro-
priations for the support of the Army for the
year ending the 30th of June, 1856, and for
other purposesprovided, that the quantity
issued to either of the Territories or to the.
District of Columbia shall not exceed the pro-
portion to which the smallest State shall be
entitled by law; and provided, also that the
distribution to the late rebel States shall be
postponed until hereafter authorized by law,
but the distribution to the other States and to
the Territories shall be made forthwith.
The question was upon ordering the joint
resolution to be engrossed and read a third
time.
Mr. KASSON. Is this joint resolution be-
fore the House by unanimous consent, or has
it been reported from a committee?
The SPEAKER. It was introduced by
unanimous consent by the gentleman from Wis-
consin, [Mr. Paine.]
Mr. KASSON. I hope the gentleman from
Wisconsin [Mr. Paine] will not press this joint
resolution to a vote now. It provides for the
disbursement of what has cost the Government
several million dollars, and a great deal of
which would be utterly useless to the States
when distributed to them. I should like to
read it in print, and I suppose it will appear
in the Daily Globe to-morrow.
Mr.. PAINE. This measure has been very
carefully considered by myself, and I hope it
will be passed now. I hope the gentleman
will not press his objection to it.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I would inquire
of the Chair if the joint resolution is now pend-
ing before the House.
The SPEAKER. It is; and the question is
upon ordering it to be engrossed and read a
third time.
Mr. PAINE. I call the previous question.
Mr. LE BLOND. I desire to say that if I
had heard the joint resolution read, I should
have objected to it in the first instance. But
we had.no means of knowing what was in the
joint resolution until it was finally reported.
The SPEAKER. The title was reported,
as is usual, and no objection was made.
Mr. THAYER. I think the general impres-
sion of the House was that it was read through
simply for information. * The House should
not certainly pass so important a measure as
this without consideration.
Mr. PAINE. If the motion for the pre-
vious question is in order I insist upon it.
Mr. FINCK. I would have objected to the
introduction of this joint resolution if I had
known what was in it.
The SPEAKER. Any member had the
right to reserve his objection until after it was
read through; but no member reserved any
such right.
Mr. KASSON. Do I understand that an
objection will not prevail now?
The SPEAKER. It will not.
Mr. ROSS. Is it in order to move to refer
this joint resolution to tha Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs ?
The SPEAKER. It is not pending the call
for the previous question. If the previous ques-
tion is not seconded then the motion will be m
order.
The question was taken upon seconding tho
demand for the previous question; and upon a
division there wereâayes 53, noes 40.
Before the result of the vote was announced,
Mr. FINCK called for tellers.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs FiNuxauu
Paine were appointed.
The House again divided; and the tellers
reportedâayes sixty-six, noes not counted.
So the previous question -yas seconded and
tha main question was ordered.
