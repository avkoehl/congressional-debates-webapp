LAWRENCE, October 10, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I will take the field and keep it as long as I can, and had so intended when this emergency arose. If I am to be virtually superseded I respectfully request that orders to that effect be issued, as I cannot remain at my headquarters without a command.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Lawrence, October 10, 1864.

Captain B. F. SIMPSON,

Acting Assistant Quartermaster, Paola, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: The militia of Johnson County and the range of counties west concentrate at Olathe; the militia of Miami and the range of counties west at Paola; the militia of Linn, Anderson, and Coffey that Mound City; of Bourbon, Woodson, &amp;c., at Fort Scott. This will indicate to you where forage is needed. The State troops are expected to bring their own transportation, but I fear not much will be obtained from farmers, &c. Get everything in the best shape you can. I want some five or six scouts who can be relied on kept in your employ for the present. If I go to Olathe you will have to join me, and will be advised in time.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.
