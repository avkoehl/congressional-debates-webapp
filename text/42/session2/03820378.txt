Mr. SCOTT. I also present the petition of
a number of citizens of Alleghany county,
Pennsylvania, who are interested in transport-
ation on the Ohio river. They state that
under the act of July 14, 1862, allowing the
construction of bridges across the Ohio river
with channel-spans of only three hundred feet
in width, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
Company, in 1869, commenced the construc-
tion of their bridge at Parkersburg at a point
where the water-way was so narrow that the
bridge contemplated would be fatally disastrous
to the river commerce, owing to the abrupt
bend and strong winding currents existing at
that point; that owing to this improvident
legislation allowing the location of the bridge
at this point, these citizens, for the purpose of
averting this disaster to their interests that
would have ensued, contributed a sum of
money, amounting to $30,000, to secure an
additional passage-way under that bridge.
They now state that this sum was contributed
in the faith that a just Government would re-
imburse its citizens the cost of saving them-
selves from the injurious consequences of its
own mistake, and they pray that it be reim-
bursed, in the sums contiibuted, to the persons
whose names are given. I move that this peti-
tion be referred to the Committee on Com-
merce.
The motion was agreed to.

Mr. COLE. I present the petition of Mae-
onchay & Co., and Patrott & Co., and others,
very influential firms and business men of San
Francisco, asking for a reduction of the duty
on rice. 1 move its reference to the Commit-
tee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COLE. I have also a similar petition
signed by a very large number of the Chinese
firms of that city, some fifty or sixty of them.
The petition gives the particular number and
the street iu which they are doing business,
and is a bona fide petition. They set forth
the increase of the importation of that product
within the last few years, ,and the further fact
that the tariff upon rice amounts to from one
hundred to one hundred and fifty per cent.
They do not ask for an entire abolition of the
duty upon this article, but simply a reduction ;
and as it is an article of such common use
among the poor and laboring people of the
country, I can see no reason in the world why
this duty should not be reduced. Indeed, I do
not see for myself any good reason why the
duty -upon rice should not be entirely taken
off. I move the reference of the petition to
the Committee on Finance.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chairdesires
to state, that this may not be considered as a
precedent, that by the usage of the Senate,
repieatedly affirmed, it has been decided that
petitions from foreigners cannot be received,
except through the State Department, the only
medium by which we communicate with for-
eigners. The Senator has stated that this is a
petition from Chinese firms. The Chair makes
no objection, but he simply makes this state-
ment, so that this shall not be considered a
precedent.
Mr. COLE. I understood that that rule
