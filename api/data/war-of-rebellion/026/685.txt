28,000 to 30,000. One of the spies, who has spent weeks in their camps, supplied a list of that army, as well as Lee's, and 28,000 was the figure on April 1. He has enforced the conscription most vigorously in several counties, not heretofore visited, on this side of the Blackwater. He has been joined by 4,000 from Hill, and perhaps more; but the advance of Hooker will soon force him to the river. His men are ready to go at a moment's warning.
