Colonel WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I am directed by General Woods to say that he has just reached this place. The rebels have torn up the bridge, but not destroyed it. They made no attempt to burn it, the heavy timbers all standing. The rebels, some 1,500 or 2,000 strong, with a small wagon train and four pieces of artillery, are reported by citizens not to have crossed Little River at this bridge, but to have taken a road leading up the river on this side to a crossing some seven miles above here, and there is every appearance that this is the case, there being no marks of a wagon train moving on the road on the other side of the river. The road leads up the river on this side, turning at a point about 300 yards this side of the bridge. We have had some skirmishing but lost no men.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

FRED. H. WILSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - It will take until 5 o'clock this afternoon to ix the bridge, as considerable new timber has to be got out to replace that destroyed by the rebels. There is one regiment from the division across the Little River covering the working party at the bridge.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
