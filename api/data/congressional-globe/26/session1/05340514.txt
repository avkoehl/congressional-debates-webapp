80 that amendment was concurred in.
The foanh amendment of the committee «appropriating the

Mr. HUBBARD demanded ths yeas and nays; which the
Mouse refused to order
Toe question was then taken, and the bill was ordered tobe
engrossed and read a third time, and 11 was read the third time,
and the question being, "Shall the bill passl"
Mr PETRIKIN moved to recommit the bill to the Commit
ssmee of the Wnole House on the state of the Union, with in-
structions so to amend it as 10 strike out the appropriation for
• dry dock at New York
Mr P advocated his motion to recommit with much warmih.
He alledsd to the present state of the Tieasury, and contended
that we were not now prepared to expend so much money in
the erection of a dry dock which was not wanted He called
«pen gentlemen not to waste the money of the people in that
manner For his part, he was an advocate 01 equal rights, and
when they legislated, it ought to be for the good 01 the poor as
wallas the rich specula ore He declared that whatever others
might do, he would never vote for any thing which was in di-
rect violation of the professions he made to the world He called
upon ihe House to bejustbetore it was generous, and, above all
things, tobe honest. Let those gentlemen who made such pro-
fessions of economy, now walk up to the chalk Let them come
up tothecrack l'ke men, and show the country then vo^es. II
this appropriation for a useless dry dock at New York was to
be male, taking  95,0)U of the people's money for a beg nning,
which would actually cost a million, let the country see who it
was that voted. Ha was determined to let it be seen if he could,
and he desired the yeas and nays en his motion might be taken
I/* gentleman corae up to the chalk on the yeas and nays, let
tneie be no •Irulking in the matter
Mr. HOFFMAN then sprung upon his leet, and said that on
a certain occasion after a thril1 log speech in the liritish House of
Commons, an immediate a ljournmant was moved, lest by other
speakers the enraptured tuarers should be awoke from the
trance into which they had been thrown So, said Mr H af-
ter hearing so sublime an appeal from the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, in order that the effect it has produced may not be
marred by the humbler speeches of other members, I move
ths previous question.
Which received a second—ayes 72, noes 39.
So thj motion to recommit was cut off
The main question was ordered to be pat, and the question be-
ing "Shall the bill pass 1"
Mr. HUBBARD demanded the yeas and nays; which having
been ordered, were—yeas 154, nays 10

the rule, obligatory for every member in his seat to vote
Mr STANLY said the gentleman looked towards him, and
be defied him to compel him to vote
Mr. CARR said he did allude to the gentleman from North
Carolina and others.   The 1 ule should be enforced upon them
do the bill was passed.
Mr PROFFIT asked the general consent of the House to go
into committee for the remainder of the evening, on the bill
from the Senate entitled an act to confirm to the Stab* of Indi
ana the land «electa;! by her for that portion of the Wabash and
Ene canal which lies between the mouth of the Tippecanoe
river and Terre Haute, and lor other purposes Mr P said
he was willing that the bill should be passed upon without de-
bate, and he would not debate it unless calleJ upon to explain
Its p ovisions.
Mr JUNES of Virginia had no objection, if the bill would
aot give nse to debate, but he was of opinion that it weald,
and he did net think that this bill shoulo be taken up in prefe-
rence to the appropriation bills They should be acted upon
first.
Mr. CAVE JOHNSON said the best course to get speedy ac-
tion apon the bill would be to discharge the Committee of the
Whole, so as to bring it before the House, he therefore made
that motion
A debate of a conversational character here took place; and
before thequesuon was taken,
Mr. STEENROD moved that the House adjourn, which was
agreed to on count—ayes 75, noes 57
The House accordingly adjourned.
