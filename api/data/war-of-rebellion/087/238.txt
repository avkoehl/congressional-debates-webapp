near the crater with a storming party of the One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, led by Captain Brown of that regiment and Lieutenant Price of the One hundred and sixteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, acting assistant adjutant-general of Mulholland's brigade. Lieutenant Price was unfortunately killed. This party held the work for a short time, capturing several prisoners, including two field against them, and General Miles had not the troops at his disposal to pursue his advantage. On the same night he captured a part of the enemy's picket-line, on the Jerusalem plank road, holding it for two or three hours, and retiring at leisure. Lieutenant Colonel Burke, Eighty-eighth New York Volunteers, is highly commended for his good conduct on this occasion. He had command of the attacking party. Captain Jerry Brown, One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers, is recommended for promotion by brevet to the rank of major for the gallant manner in which he led the storming party from the One hundred and forty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers.

A tabular statement of casualties is hereto appended.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

Major-General of Volunteers.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac.
