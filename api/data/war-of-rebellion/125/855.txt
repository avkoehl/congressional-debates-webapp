The reels not being suitable, we adopted a form of our own; the instruments and insulators were found most too frail, and therefore we have suggested improvements, some of which I believe are being made.

Considering that this branch, of the service was entirely new to us and had to be wholly reorganized, I think we have succeeded remarkably well with it, and great praise is due Captain J. C. Van Duzer for its successful operation in his department-the only one in which it has been needed in my division. For details thereof you are respectfully referred to his report, herewith transmitted.

Our success is attributable in a great measure to the operators, who, with but few exceptions, have been very faithful in the performance of their duties, and deserve much credit thereof.
