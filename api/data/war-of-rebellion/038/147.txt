LA GRANGE, March 25, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Information just received from General Brayman, at Bolivar, says:

Thirteen guerrillas just arrived. Sent in by Colonel Hurst at Pocahontas. They left last night. No re-enforcements had then arrived. FIFTEEN more prisoners sent to Bethel. Our loss, 1 private killed. Colonel Miller, of the rebel forces, killed. Sol. [G.] Street said to be desperately wounded. No danger.

Major-General HURLBUT, Memphis:

What news have you? What from Vicksburg? What from Yazoo Pass? What from Lake Providence? What generally?

A. LINCOLN.
HDQRS. SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, March 25, 1863.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States:

Two DIVISIONS of General Sherman's command are in Steele's Bayou, above Haynes' Bluff, and two DIVISIONS in Yazoo Pass, near Greenwood. Water runs freely into Lake Providence, but Bayou Macon is encumbered with trees. About 900 square miles of Upper Louisiana under water. Canal at Vicksburg deep enough but not wide enough. Enemy are repairing Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and will run to Tupelo by next week. This road is strongly guarded. All indications point to a steady abandonment of Vicksburg and concentration on Rosecrans, with a DIVISION on my left. Enemy's cavalry in front of Corinth are being strongly re-enforced. This, I think, is a cover, unless Van Dorn is driven across the Tennessee, when we may have something to do.

The troops in this command are in fine order and ready for what may turn up.

S. A. HURLBUT.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., March 25, 1863.

Major-General HALLECK:

May I ask what was the purport of the order you sent to General Grant about the detention of boats? Does it give me any authority?

The tow-boats employed in towing coal barges are detained, and, if continued, will stop the supply of coal.

ROBERT ALLEN,Chief Quartermaster.

WASHINGTON, March 26, 1863.

Colonel ROBERT ALLEN:

The orders to General Grant were peremptory, not to detain boats, but to send them back immediately.
