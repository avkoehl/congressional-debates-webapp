From your dispatch of yesterday, and also from one from General Logan, it looks as through the enemy was preparing for a move against our line of communications east of Chattanooga, and it may be west of there also.

You will therefore, if you have not already done so, place heavy guards upon the important railroad brigades both east and west of Chattanooga, so that they cannot, without a severe battle, destroy them. This should be attended to without delay.
