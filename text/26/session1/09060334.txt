AVPmmXJi TO THE COttGRESSÍONAL GLÓfeE
26th Cohg....1st Sess.
Appropriation Bill—Mr. Samuels.
April, 1840.
H. of Reps.
Without stopping to defmd the President and
the former Congress from the grave charge im-
plied in the statement of my colleague, I mus-t say
that the censor  conveyed by it is most unjus-.
The charge i , that a secret influence is po-sensed
by the Executive over a co-ordinate braneh of the
Government, which is alike dishonorable to be th.
Yet because he foregoes the exercise of that al-
leged influence in regard to a most important
branch of public basness, it is made a subject of
reproach. If such influence did exist, it would
not have been a cause of complaint that it was
permitted to lie inactive forever.
My colleague gave his testimony, without re-
serve, egatnst the extravagance of the present and
late Administration; he condemned them without
any qualification or saving whatever. He gave
amounts of money expended in various years, and
because the amounts in ceitain years exceeded he
amoun s in certain other years by large sums, he
considered the charge fully made out. It seems
to me, however, that, if the expenditures in 1838
exceeded those in 1826 by the sumof fifteen millions
of dollars, it by no means follows that the expendi-
tures of 1838 were extravagant, because it might
be necessary and prorer to expend so much more
in 1838 than in 1826. The charge alleged, is,
that a useless and wasteful expenditure of public
money has been made; my colleague bere testi-
mony to the truth of the charge. It is due alike to
himself, to his constituents, and to the country, that
full proof should be obtained upon this subject.
The charge is a conclusion drawn from many
facts, and the justice or injustice of that conclu-
sion most depend upon the facts from which it is
drawn. The candor and liberality of my colleague
should prompt him to bear testimony in favor of
the Administration upon those points wherein they
art justified. That gentleman was a member of the
Twenty-fifth Congress: that Congress made the
appropriations which were expended in the year
1838, in which were made the largest of the ex-
penditures complained of. Tesrimonv coming from
my celleasue would have grent weight; and it would
be important to hear him upon each item of ex-
cess of expenditure in 1838 over 1826. I have pre-
pared a table contrasting the expenditures of those
years respectively, and would like to know which
of the appropriations in 1838 he approved, and
which he opposed. The aggregate of the excess is
made up of smaller sums; and if each item of ex-
cess be justified, the whole cannot be wrong.
The table is not perfect, because of the great
difficulty in identifying the character of the expen-
ditures in those years. 1 will not detain the com-
•mittee by a minute examination of these particu-
lars, bat there are a few iiems so large in amount
as to show how a great part of the excess was
created. For instance:

[In the progress of the recital of the table, much
desultory debate occurred between Mr. Samuels
and Mr. Wise, !he former insisting that if any one
of these excesses was improper and inexpedient, it
should be pointed out, and interrogating Mr. Wise
as to his votes in regard to several of them. Mr.
W. said it was impossib'e for him to recollect how
he m-ght have voted upon particular appropria-
tions. In regard to the increased expenses of the
army, Mr. W. said he was not answerable at all,
as he had oy>po ed the increase of the army, which
necessarily increased the expenses. Mr. W. final-
ly declined answering any further questions.]
Mr. SAMUELS said ii was, in his opinion,
wholly unjust to make a g n^ral and sweep-
ing denunciation of waste and extravagance
against the Administration, without being able
and willing to particulars. Such a coarse
involved this injustice; there are many items
of excess which all must agree ought tobe subjecti
of commendation r?.ther than of censure: as, for in-
stance, the expenditure on account of the trust
funds. These funds were received almost entirely
by the Government in satisfaction of claims by our
citizens upon foreign Governments, yet? when
paid over to the rightful owners, they go to swell
the aggregate of expenditure, and are thus made
the cause of repreaeh—that is, the Administration
is reproached for successfully asserting, and ho-
nestly'paying over, the claims of our citizens upon
fore'gn powers.   ,
Mr. Chairman: I think it has already been shown
that the responsibility of passing approp iation
laws rests wholly upon Congress. It is for the peo-
ple, who are deeply intetes'ed, to inquire into this
subject, and if there be any waste, to hold those
accountable who caused it. It is a fact perfectly
well known, that the original unmixed "Whig
party" and their new alies, the «'Conservative par-
ty," held the power in the House of Representa-
tives during the Twenty-fifth Congress, which made
the appropriations for 1838. In regard to the
Whig party, the immediate political friends of my
colleague—he must admit that they were not under
the influence ef the Executive—whatever ihey did,
or omitted to do, cannot be charged to that officer.
Th? "Conservative party" made a great display of
independence; they have not permitted the world to
be in ignorance of their singular fortitude in with, •
