NASHVILLE, TENN., October 6, 1864.

General A. C. GILLEM,

Bull's Gap:

General Sherman directs me to recall General Burbridge, but he can hardly get back to do any good in the matter occasioning his recall. I have no intelligence from him except a report in the newspapers that he has captured the salt-works. Forrest is supposed to be trying to get across the river (Tennessee) somewhere about or below Florence. Northing certain from him for several days.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier - General.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

General Meredith telegraphs from Paducah that a rebel cavalry force of 500, which he considers the advance of a large force, is advancing toward Paducah from Jackson, and asks for re- enforcements. Captain Dickson says General Burbridge has no troops.
