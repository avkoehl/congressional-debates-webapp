ships eor foreign trade.
Mr. CHANDLER. I am exceedingly anx-
ious to. hear the termination of the speech of
my friend from Delaware. I hope there will
be no further interruption. I shall be com-
pelled to object. That speech I insist upon
hearing.
Mr. CAMERON. I move that the Senate
take up the bill (II. It. No. 1115) for the relief
of Robert Brigham, late postmaster, Franklin,
Pennsylvania.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the
Chair understand the Senator from Michigan
to object to other business ?
Mr. CHANDLER. I want to hear the con-
tinuation of my friend's speech. I must object
to everything else.
Mr. CAMERON. To House bill No. 1115 ?
Mr. CHANDLER. Yes, sir. I must object
to the consideration of any and everything. I
give notice that I hope to pass this bill now ;
and if I do not it will become the unfinished
business on the first day of the meeting of
Congress; and I insist on keeping it in its
order of business.
Mr. WILS ON, (at five minutes to five o' clock.)
The committee appointed for that purpose have
waited upon the President, and the President
stated to the committee that he has no further
communication to make to Congress.
Mr. STEWART. I wish to make a remark
on the bill before the Senate.
Mr. CAMERON. I appeal to the Senator
from Michigan to say, can he now prevent the
passage of my bill after I have helped him so
much to-day? [Laughter.]
Mr. STEWART. I simply wish to say that
the friends of protection and of high protec-
tion, of special local protection, had better be
a little careful that they are not pressing the
matter too far. It seems to me they have to-day
shown a selfishness that may be injurious to
them. I hope they have considered the whole
thing. I think they are making a very great
mistake. That is all I have to say about it. I
express the opinion that they have made a mis-
take that they will be sorry for.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Those who oppose the
bill or those who favor itâ€”which do you mean ?
Mr. STEWART. Those who oppose the
bill.
Mr. SCOTT. I hope the Seuatorfrotn Ne-
vada will also admonish the chairman of the
Committee on Commerce that, having intro-
duced this bill on the 31st of May, he ought to
regret not having reported it until the 13th of
July, within the last two days of the session.
Mr. STEWART. I think he also ought to
regret, and that seriously, that he did not have
foreknowledge enough to know what would
occur. If he had been endowed with fore-
knowledge he might have known that it was
important to have this bill passed. I think he
is very censurable that he did not know what
was going to occur before it did occur.
Mr. NYE. I think my colleague is a little
severe on the chairman of the Committee on
Commerce. I wish to inquire about the Chi-
nese bill; will my colleague call that up?
[Laughter. ]
Mr. CAMERON. I am surprised that my
friend from Nevada should get up and make a
speech when my bill is pending. [Laughter.]
Mr. CHANDLER. There is just time for a
vote on my bill before the Senate adjourns. I
call for the yeas and nays.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Delaware has the floor oa the bill.
adjournment.
Mr. ROBERTSON. I want to pass a little
bill, House bill No. 1596, for the relief of the
Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, of Charleston,
South Carolina.
Mr. SUMNER and others. Pass that.
The bill was read.
Mr. ROBERTSON. The bill has passed
the House.
Mr. DRAKE. I inquire Whether it requires
unanimous consent to take up that bill at this
time?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It does
not. It requires the vote of the Senate.
Mr. DRAKE. How many must consent
to it?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. A major-
ity of the Senate.
Mr. DRAKE. A majority of the Senate, sir!
I should like to know what would constitute a
majority of the Senate upon this occasion ?
Mr. ROBERTSON. Let us have a count.
Mr. DRAKE. I commend the Senator from
South Carolina to count the Senate, for he can-
not count on this bill passing this afternoon.
[Laughter.]
Mr. ROBERTSON. I am sure we can pass
it, if the Senator will yield.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The hoar
of five o'clock has arrived, and, in pursuance
of the concurrent resolution of Congress, 1
pronounce the Senate adjourned sine die.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, July 15, 1870.
The House met at nine o'clock a. m. Prayer
by the Chaplain, Rev. J. G. Butleb, as follows:
Great God, by whose almighty power and
boundless love we have been spared during all
these months, we now ask Thy blessing upon us
in these closing hours; we pray Thee that Thou
wilt forgive wherein we have sinned against
ourselves, or against each other, or against the
great God of truth and love and mercy, and
bless us with Thy peace. Sanctify to us Thy
providences, which have removed one and
another of our number to the land of spirits.
And, oh! teach us alwaj's to number our days
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Bless, we pray Thee, 0 God, all that has
been done during this session of Congress, and
have our country, our persons, and all the in-
terests of our families and of our Government
in Thy holy keeping. Keep us in Thy fear to-
day ; preserve us from sin, grant grace to these
Thy servants, that amidst these perplexing
and responsible and trying duties they may be
strengthened, that Thy fear may be before their
eyes and Thy love in their hearts. And as we
separate to our homes, take us in Thy rare in
our journeys, bless us in ail our families, and in
Thy good time return us to this place. If any
of us are appointed to die, prepare us, 0 God,
for death ; and help us so to live that we may
fall to sleep in the arms of our blessed Re-
deemer, and pass joyfully to the land where
there are no more toils and no more tears.
These mercies we ask, with the forgiveness
of our sins and the indwelling of Thy Spirit,
and a conscience void of offense toward God
and toward man, for the sake of Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.
