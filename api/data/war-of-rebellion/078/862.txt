PALMETTO, September 22, 1864.

General BRAGG:

I shall, unless Sherman moves south, so soon as I can collect supplies, cross the Chattahoochee River, and form lines of battle near Powder Springs. This will prevent him from using the Dalton railroad and force him to drive me off or move south, when I shall fall upon his rear. I make this move, as Sherman is weaker now than he will be in future, and I as strong as I can expect to be. Would it not be well to move a part of the important machinery [from] Macon to the east of the Oconee River, and do the same at Augusta to the east side [of the] Savannah? If done, it will be important to make the transfer so as not to interfere with the supplies for the armies.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

There are a large number of supernumerary officers in the army and throughout the country, owing to the consolidation of regiments and brigades. Cannot their resignations be accepted if they will join some regular organizations or form some organization of their own, selecting their own officers?

General BRAGG,

Richmond:

Brigadier-General Wright unfit for field service; commanding at Augusta; is doing good service there. I respectfully request, if compatible with the interests of the services, that Brigadier- General Wright be allowed to remain there. Brigadier-General Fry has been ordered to assume command there.

Major DILLARD,

Quartermaster, Columbus:

I have telegraphed General Lawton for the order for the shoes. The army is in great need of them. Can I not have 3,000 pairs at once?

J. B. HOOD,

General.
