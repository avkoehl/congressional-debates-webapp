Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

The enemy attacked my picket-line on my right in considerable force about 5.30 p. m., and drove my vedettes back to main line, but were repulsed on reaching there. The reserve was at once ordered up in season to assist in repelling a second charge and in following up and re-establishing my line of vedettes on the original line. I had 3 or 4 of the Tenth Connecticut wounded. The enemy is reported to have suffered considerably in the last charge.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,
