LITTLE SANTA FE., October 25, 1864-5.20 a. m.

Major-General SMITH:

I can hear nothing of you. I sent a note to you last evening. It is a profound disappointment placing your infantry thirty-six hours behind time. The best thing you can do is to move down the Line road as rapidly as possible. The enemy is fully thirty-five miles ahead of us. I placed a courier line on the road yesterday, but could not communicate with you. You ought to have communicated with me. I move at 6 o'clock on the Line road south. I shall probably encamp on Grand River, but will send back word to you. No news from the front since yesterday at 9 o'clock.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

CAMP ON GRAND RIVER,

Military Road, October 25, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General SMITH,

Hickman Mills:

Move to Harrisonville with your entire command; communicate with us by the military road. Send word to Warrensburg of your arrival and get supplies from there and get all the train now at Warrensburg to your camp at Harrisonville. Anything that you can do to intercept band of straggling guerrillas, reported moving south from the Missouri River, will be of service to the command in front. We shall encamp at Coldwater Grove to-night.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
