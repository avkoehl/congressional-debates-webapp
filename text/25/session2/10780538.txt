ai?Víi!L ? Proofs I must necessanly adven to eviden e,
which he dwelt upon with a force and clearness that I cannot
liope to improve I have bestowed time enough uloü this sub

tnattneiereally is no question in the ca*e, so clear and decisive
is tne evidence, and it really seems to me that while om com
mieaionera have examined the cats wuh great ability, by far
the laiger portion of the evidence and the argumente are about
any thing and every thing but the direct question raised by the
treaty The language of the treaty is so explicit that nothing
is leftm doubt to argue about By mno*ucing collateral matter,
e-nd thus making tip, as you see, Mr Pi evident, great folio vo
j luirles, Cheat Britain has succeed in compelling us lo print
booksttf refute reatumng thathasbut aiemote bearing,u any
! at all, on the subject Tins is the fiuit of dip'omacy I shall
prove, before I sit down, that this process has worked us into
our piesent condition, for, when we began to negotiate, no
doubt darkened the mmd of enhei Govei nment in regard to the
questions now agitated Great Britain leasoned as we reason,
and admitted what we nowilaim
If the Senate will examine the treatv of 17P3 on which rest
our right*, they will perceive that his Bntanic Majesty, m the
first aiticle, ' «"knowledges the United State*  vi? New Ham p
shire, Massachusetts Bay, [&c namme them all,] to be free,
sovereign, and independent States that he ticats with them as
such, and foi himself, his hens, and successors íehnquishes all
claims ti the Government, propuety, ind teiiitorial rights of
thebame, and eveiy part theieqf" This language shows a
plain intention of separating foi evei from Gieat Britain the
fmtue lemtory of each State, without dimir ution The treaty,
then pioceeds
'And that all disputes which micht af He in future on the
subject of the boundaries of the sud United States may be pre
ven ed it is hereby agreed and declared that J he following are
and shall be, then boundaries, to wit
cAiticle2 Fiom the northwest angle of Nova ¡Scotia^lo

and from i/s ~$ource'directly 7101 th lo the a{t resaid JugJüands

Such is the plain, unambiguous reading of the treaty, and
yet Great lintam denies that, by ihisdebcnption, we can find
the Unes described
The question then is, wheie is tho northwest angle of Nova
ft olía'* This is the point of dej ar me and manifestly spoken
of as a known pre existing pi ice I shall first consider thii
question upon the evidence contained m the treaty, and I hold
that the prt of on the flee of this instrument is so plain, so un
equivocal,and so decisive, that it is next to impossible that this
pointshouldnotbe ascertained with precision The noithwebt
angle of Tsova Rcotia is the angle iwimed by the noith and the
Westboundaiy of ihat piovmce This north line is continued
along th highlands westerly between the United SiatesandCa
nada The intei&ection of these lines theiefore, constitutes also
thí northeast angle ( f tl e United State Th© noith west angle
of NoviSeoti us «elected as the staitn ? point doubtless be
i auce the north and the we&t lines of Nova Scotia were ancient
and known line*, and, consequently the angle an ancient,
known angle If, thei, we can by the tic tty imd the northeast
angle ol the United btites, is it springs from the same point,
we shall identif) the place in questun
The treaty tcllo u^ in sub'ta cc thatthfteis no monument
at (Ins place, out points out how theangle is tobe found, vt7
by di iwmga hue from the couue of the St Croix nvei due
not (hto the highlands w iic i divide the nveis emptying into
the "*t lawience fiom those which fill intotlie \ttautic Ocean
The source of tl e M Cioix i^ ascertained by íguement, inda
monume it has been made I rom this monument, if a line be
run due noith till it falls uj on he highlands described, then at
itt, tu minus is the nouhvvest an«!c of Isova Scotia Whoever
looks at the map will see that thei e is m elevation ofland which
foims the southeastei i &k it of the vtlley of the St lawience,
horn which watersdividean 1 flow doth ways, and that this is
the only highland, south and cist of the tot lav.ren.ee, from
which waterilows into that river It it, equally obvious that a
duenoith line from the monument wul fall upon this highland,
and that it can fall ui on no c thei which sends downriversmto
the bt Lawrence \\ e can then at once satisfy the two great
ind leading requirements of* the ticaty Wt can run a line
dae north hom the head of the St Cioix till it leaches the
summit t f laud which sends its watusdown into the St law
lente Ihetieatv lequues that the nofihem boundary of the
Unit d^tites shilhin along this summit and at the mtersec
tion of these two Ime-s tlie one lunnng north and the otlter
westerl), shad be the nouhvvest angle of iSovaScoUa, and the
northeast angle if tl e Uní ed States Is there, then, any em
bdriassment whatever midentifyirg this point* I think, to an
ingenuous mind there is none
But Great Uutain is not 'a'i&fied, because she say the treaty
lequues highlands from which wafei flows into the Atlantic
Ocean tdso    I ook, then on the map and yo*u will see it every
wheie diversified with ihe sources oí fcüeams flowing down the
o hei   felope of these hi0hUnds into the sea    There are the
head waters of the Ri-tigouche the St John's , the Penohscot,
Ac    Po not these wat^i^ now into the sea i   Yes, says Great
Uiitun, but the Ilia igouche  flows nrst through the Cay of
Chalenr and the Gulf of fet   Lawience, an 1 tl e St   John's
thiough the Bay of Fundv   therefoie these nveis do not fall
into the sea and the treat / description tails in this ] ai   cular
Is this a pn¡,t conclusion?    Suppose this ctrcumstance created
a real doubt v> hether thes* rivet-, ("n fíow n o the sea, can that
control the othei evidence m the treaty, oi must that doubt
yield to evidence which ib clear and decisivo?   The hiffhlinda
spoken í f mus,, '■end down the i rivers into the St Lawience
the line fimn the St Croi\ mtibt be due 101 th to such highlands    i
\nd fahall i be su 1  th^t we can find ne.thei  the one nor the   j
othei when •* e find h   h becmup the waters of the Risti?oucl c    \
where this hie terminates, fovv thiough the Bay of Chaleu,r   j
into the sea'   Ivoth nc is plainer than that this doubt must   !
yield to evidence  tl at is tus deci ive  and the Ribiigoucho   '
must be taken as a rver r feued to, vvhose waters now into  !
the sea    lhe map shov s is that you cannot íun a nouh line
toan) other highlard whici divid s the riverB which empty
into the St Iawrence fiom those which empty into thcAtlan
tic ocean
But, sir, the Bays of Fundy arm Chaleur, and the Gulf of
St I awrence, are parts of the Atlantic ocean That ocean em
braces all bay  and inlets formed by it These waters are parts
of the gieat whole, and Chaleur and Ftmdy are places in that
ocean as much as the Grand Bank or George's Bank, or the
Gulfs of Mexico and St Lawrence The names are given m
matter of convenience, and we might as well contend t&at
Washington is not in the District of Columbia, because it ha 
a name of its own, as ihat Fundy is not m tire Atlantic, or that
the oceans of the eaith combined aie not the great sea, because
each has a sepaiate name
But this part of the question has been so fully argued that I
will not further dwell upon it than to say that the treaty itself,
independent of all other considerations, leaves no doubt where
the nor'hwest ang e of Nova Scdtia is
But there is another view of the question, and T rose chiefly
to add something to what my colleague advanced on thi* head
1st I will prove that a line drawn due north fiom the head
of St Croix aver to the highlands was established in 1621. and
has ever unce been the west bound try of Nova Scotia
2d That stnet 17b3 the south line of Canada has been, and
now is, a continuous line drawn from Chaleur bay, which se
parates that province from Nova bcotia, along the highlands
southwesterly which divide the nveis which empty themselves
into the St Lawrence from those which fall into the sea, to the
waters of Connect .ut river
3d That the noithwest angle of Nova Scotia was, at the
making of the treaty of 1783, in this south line of Canada, at
the point where the west Hi e of Nova Scotia interacted lu
4th That it follows from the&e facts being established, that
(he lines described by the tre uy coincide with the lines of the
two provinces as they had Jong existed, so fai as Massachusetts
(now Maine) is bounded on them
5th That Great Britain established and maintained these
lines as the true boundaries till 1783, when the treaty was made,
and afteiwards, till she found her mtere&t would be promoted
by own ng a portion of Maine which lies betweui Canada and
New Brunswick, and would afford a freer and better communi
cation between these provinces
AH this I will prove from the official acts and declarations of
the Government of Great Britain
The great question is, where is the northwest angle of Nova
Scotia? for at the same point is the noitheast angle of the United
States When the treaty was made, Mame was a part of Masea
chusetts, New Brunswick a part of Nova Siona, and Canada
was called the Province of Quebec With this explanation I
proceed
First  as to the west line of Nova Scotia    The Province of
Nova Scotia was granted by Jimes the first, in 1C2J, to Sir
William Alexander ( and I will abk attention to the west aud
north boun (ary, which alone are í i portant in this inquuy
The west line begins at Cape Sable, the southwest point of
Nova Scotia, thence across the enti anee of what is now called
the Bay of Fundy, but was then called a great inlet of the sea,
to the St Croiv. aver th nee up that river to its highest spring
or head, thence noith to the waters of the St Lawrence, or, as
it was then called the Great lliver of Canada  thence dowu the
bank of th it nver to the eea and round to the place ol begin
ning    Mitchell'*, map of this province, publ shtd in 1755, was
as lo agreed, used by the negotiators in making the treaty  j
1783, and on this map this hne appeals running due north
until  it reaches the south branch of the St  Lawrence, and
then down the bank, making the northwest angle at this point
In 1703 I lance ceded Canada, which was bounded on the
south bank of i he St lawience, which separated it fiom Maine
and Nova Scotia, to Gieat Britain, who thus became the pro
puetor ofagreat portion of Noith America    In that year, the
King issued his proclamation establishing the Province of Que
bee    Bv this nioclamation it appears that he moved ihesoutfc
line ofCanada fi om themerto the highland*., so as to em
brace withm the Piovmce of Q,ueh c the valley of the St Law
rence    Thus, a large tract of lard was taken fiom Maine and
Nova *ko ia, and annexed to Quebec    In passing from west to
east, this new south line lsiepusented at. cubing the St La a
rence m the 45th deg  of north latitude and continuing on that
parallel across the I o.ke Champ'ain to the highlands, thei 
ualongthe highland* which divid  the rueis ichich empty
thevwelt c* into the said St JLaxm ence f1  oír th***> whtck fall
into the sea and also along the north coa*t of the Bay de&
Ckalews," to the Gulf of bt Lawrence. &c Thus, the north
we*t angle of Nova Scotia was moved back with this lme,
which extended along these highlands from near the head wa
ters of Connecticut nver,  not theasteily, for thiee hundred
miles, to the head waters of Chaleur bay, which lies between
Canada and Nova Scotia    No other chanee wap made in the
lines of Nova Scotia or Maine by the proclamation, except thu**
to place then northern front on these highlands
In 1774, thia. south line of Canada was confirmed by an act of
Parliament, in which the description is leveled, and runs thus
'Bounded on the southby a line fiom the Bay of Chaleur,
along the highland* which divide Lhe noirs that empty them
selves into the S1/ Luir-rencejromt/iose ir hick fall in o tie
sea, to a point m foity five decrees of northern latitude, arid the
eastern bank of Connecticut river, ; A.r
t In 17b3 James Murray was made Governor of Quebec, and
jhr south line of the province, as debCi ¡bed in th s commission,
s identical with that in the proclamation and act of Parlta
merit
In 1767, and m 1774 Guy Cailtonwas made Govemoi, and
m bo h ot his commit, ionnne line i¡> similarly descrrbed
In 1/7 , Credent k HoU1imonc¡ was made Governor, and the
renewed deftnpiion of the hne m hit, commission iuns in tins
laneuace
"Bounded on the south by ahncf om the Bay of Chalem
almg the highland* which divide he nveis that empty them
selves into the river S' Law? ence from those which jail into
thes^a, to" $c
I read this des(iipt!on,foi this commission bears date oulv
six years before the making of the treaty of 17S3 and the line
remained unaltered when thattieaty was ratified
I will now bung down the histoi) oí the west line of Nova
Scotia to l! e same period
In 1763 "Montague Wilmot was made Governor of this pre
vmce His < ommssion savs, m allusion to die removal of tie
north line from the rjvei tothe highlands
1 We have thoueht proper to'restiain and eampri&e [the
pioMucel within the following limite, viz to the nrnthteard
our said piovmce shall be bounded b) the swt/iem boundary
of Quebec, aq far as the western extremity of the Bay of Cha
leui " Ac , 'Ho the wesneard it shall be bourded by a ¡me
drawn from Cape Sable acro¡es the end anee of the Bay of Fun
dy to the mouth of the river St Croix, by the said river to its
source and by a hne drawn due north from thence to the
sot/them boundary oi Quebec "
The same description i& repeated in the commission of Fran
cisLegge, in 1773, and m that of John Parr, in 1782, and the
