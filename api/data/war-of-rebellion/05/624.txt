were all hunted up in the streets and in their hiding places and brought back to their regiments. Since that time there has been no repetition of these disorderly scenes. All soldiers arrested in the city are taken to the exterior stations of the police, and guards are sent for them every morning and evening. During the month of September, about 7,000 men in and around the city, only 140 were taken in custody by the police, and of this number 59 belonged to the Second Regiment Maryland Volunteers, which was recruited in Baltimore.

The city has never been so free from disorder, disturbance, and crime as it has been during the last sixty days, and during the whole time not a single soldier has been employed in aid of the police. Much is no doubt due to the presence of a military force, and it is due to the regiments under my command to say that the orderly conduct both of officers and men has procured and improved feeling among large numbers of citizens who have been exceedingly hostile to the Government. I may say this most emphatically of the Sixth Regiment Michigan Volunteers and the eighth ward, the most disloyal in the city, within which the regiment is stationed, at the McKim mansion.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 22, 1861.

General WILLIAMS,.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: Circumstances preventing a circumstantial report* to-day of the number of men required for the garrisons of the defenses of Washington, we respectfully present the following summary, with the intention of giving another report to-morrow or as soon as practicable:

For full garrisons of works of exterior line south of

Potomac................................................ 5,952

For three reliefs of gunners for Forts Ellsworth and

Scott.................................................. 363

For one relief of gunners for Forts Runyon, Jackson,

Corcoran, Bennett, and Haggerty........................ 230

------

Total garrison south of Potomac............................ 6,545

Garrisons of works at Chain Bridge......................... 1,500

------

Total...................................................... 8,045

For three reliefs of gunners for all the works south of

the Potomac............................................... 3,000

------

Total garrisons considered necessary for all the works..... 11,045

For reserves south of Potomac from Fort Lyon to Fort

Corcoran.................................................. 12,000

Reserve at Chain Bridge.................................... 750

Reserve in city............................................ 10,000

------

Total...................................................... 33,795

The full garrisons of the works north of Potomac would amount to 9,000 men. The above estimate is based on the supposition that in all ordinary circumstances it would be only necessary to supply then with men enough to man the guns.

Respectfully submitted.

WILLIAM F. BARRY,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Artillery.

J. G. BARNARD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief Engineer.
