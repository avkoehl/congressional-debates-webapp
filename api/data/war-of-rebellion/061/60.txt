several influential parties in Saint Louis. These letters are in the hands of District Provost-Marshall Allen, who will forward them to Colonel Broadhead, provost-marshal-general of the department for his action.

On the 15th, I sent Lieutenant Harris out with a small reconnoitering party, ostensibly toprocure beef-cattle, but in reality to obtain information of the enemy's movements under McRae, who was reported, at Jacksonport. He was so far successful as to get the cattle and also valuable news of the enemy, as per his report,* forwarded herewith. I at once organized and expedition, under Captains Turner and Majors of my regiment, the result of which is contained in his report.* I regret most sincerely the unfortunate circumstances attending the captain's scout. To have lost such men as he had captured was virtually losing the whole of fruit his labors, but I beg to say that stay within 100 miles of me I will have them again, dead or alive.

On the 19th, learning that a force of Freeman's command were feeling their way toward me, I immediately sent a small party, under Captain Baxter, Fourth Arkansas Infantry, who charged 200 of the enemy at Lunenburg, 30 miles from here, and drove them, killing and wounding several. I inclose his report,* to which I refer you for particulars. The man reported missing in Captain Baxter's report was killed while gallantly refusing to surrender to superior numbers. He killed his man before being disabled.

Fearing that the steamer Pocahantos, expected, here by the 20th instant, might be detained and attacked by guerrillas from west side of White River, I dispatch and attacked by guerrillas from west side of White River, I dispatched Captain Castle, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry,+ with 75 men, to scour the country in the neighborhood of the Grand Glaize. He succeeded in dispersing a band of them, capturing Colonel Jim Rutherford and Lieutenant Stone. His report* sent herewith, gives all the particulars. Thus, within the last twenty days, six expeditions have been sent out, besides numerous minor ones with forage parties. The effect of these movements is of the very best character, and the people see that, while I forgive those who surrender under the proclamation, I at the same time hunt down and destroy all who will not. I cannot convey in words the deal that armed rebels have of my command. We never stop to count numbers, but rush right into them and invariably rout them. If I had 500 more cavalry here I would be able to do the work assigned me far more effectually than at present. My horses have to be watched very carefully, for this heavy duty will break them down, and I frequently have to reduce the force the post here to 100 men and one occasion it was less than that; but as the tents stand the encampments deceive the enemy, and the impression abroad is that there are many more Federals here than there really are. Recruiting goes on very slowly; hope it will increase soon. I do not ask for troops, but as I am right among enemy I could use them to greater advantage than where they are at many stations in Missouri. I feel certain that with a sufficiency of men, so as to move on the enemy's encampments from different directions, I would capture and destroy all there is of them in North Arkansas in two months.

The enemy do not desirous of engaging us, and from their untiring efforts at conscripting the men in the country and arresting
