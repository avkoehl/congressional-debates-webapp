106                                   THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.        ____________JmlJS,
quest of the valley of the  Mississippi was not
achieved in 1783>
How could the western country be said to have
been wrested from Great Britain as long as her
military posts were occupied by her arms, and the
numerous Indian tribes, her open allies during the
first six or seven years oí the revolutionary war,
continued to be excited to hostilities, and furnished
by her with munitions of war' The country had
not been delivered up. The peaceable and actual
possession of it was not enjoyed, but was in a state
of war. Yes, sir, a Butish war was carried on by
British mercenaries for ten or twelve years after
the treaty of 1783. Then the revolutionary war
was not ended. It raged upon the western frontier
until the final pacification in 1795 It was then,
and not till then, that Gieat Britain acquiesced in
the extension of our bounSary to the westward,
and refused any longer to afford the means of hos-
tile incursions to the Indians.
Mr Soeaker, another objection is started to the
proposition, which, when duly considered, I think
is entitled to but little weight. It is proposed to
add afewhundred,perhapsa thousand, names more
to the pension list, and not one of them who may
not be said to have passed many years in the ser-
vice of the country. It is objected that the whole
system of pensioning is demoralizing, and ought,
therefore, to be extended no further Such an ob-
jection—I speak it with deference—seems to me to
come with a bad grace just now, and against such
men as are proposed to be added to the pension
list Sir, I am not disposed to go into an argument
of the policy of-the pension system Much, no
doubt, may be said on both sides, to show the fit-
ness or unfitness of such a system in such a Gov-
ernment as ours Perjuries and corruptions of
various kinds doubtless attend the granting pen-
sions in every country. The unworthy and per-
jured applicant often steps in and enjoys the
reward due to valor and actual service only. The
community is taxed to pay the cowardly and un-
deserving soldier, as well as the one that is pa-
triotic aid deserving Many who receive this
bounty from 'he Government do not need it, and
irany misapply it when they receive it, and find no
permanent relief fiom their poverty It may be
Sruethat thegranting pensions for military services
may tend to create a mercenary spirit in our citi-
zens, and cause them to regard the sordid pay
which they may or may not receive, according to
eircumstances, when called upon to defend the
country when threatened or invaded by a foreign
foe, instead of cultivating that patriotic chivalry
tmd devotion to country which isalways the surest,
eafest, and strongest defence any people ran have
All these views may be true, and yet, sir, there
are some views on the other side of the question
worth considering The youngand discreet soldier
who engages to exhaust the energies of his youth
and the prime of his life in the service of his coun-
try, may often find his courage fortified and h s
patriotism receive a new impulse from the reflec-
tion that his old age would be rescued from the
miseries attendant on destitution, by a generous
and grateful' ountry A country acquires ahigher
moral elevation, and gives a finer tone to all its
public actions, and furnishes a new incentive to
onorable and hazardous enterprises, by the prac-
tice of that sort of justice which is voluntary, and
not yielded in obedience to law. The spectacleof
a Republic (a form of Government that has been
denounced by monarchists in all ages of the worjd,
for being ungrateful) yielding that kind of volun-
tary but substantial homage to its greatest bene-
factors, which is implied in the pensions which
have been granted, and which are now proposed
to be granted, may not be without a salutary effect
upon the feelings and judgment of the world, m
deciding upon that form ot government which is
best suited for the protection of human rights and
human happiness
Mr BURGES, of Rhode Island, could not see
the piopriety of confounding the Indian with the
revolutionary war, nor was he before aware of the
existence of an Indian war carried on for the space
of twenty years The principle on which the pen-
sions were granted to the soldiers of the revolu-
tionary war was, that those soldiers had been un-
paid for their services at the time, and were,
therefore, justly entitled to a public compensation
But this is not applicable to the case of those who
n
fought against the Indians The claim for ardu-
ous or difficult service has not been recognized by
Congress, nor has a claim foi any term of service
As to the twenty years' wai,if any has ever been,
it must have been puvate, not public, and must
have merely exhibited reciprocal energy^ on the
part of the invaders and the invaded—on the part
of the Indians to obtain forcible possession of the
territories of the frontier settlers, and on the part
of the frontier settlers to repel those attacks, and
defend their own possessions. So has it ever
been in this country since first colonized. Those
occupying the frontier settlements have always
voluntarily or compulsonly repelled the Indian at-
tack, and have pushed their frontiers further west-
ward. But which of them have ever demanded,
or thought of demanding, public remuneration for
services so performed > Where is the frontier
which had formerly existed ' There will always
be frontier settlements. There will always be
settlers on these frontiers. There will always be
wars after wars on these frontiers, so long as In-
dians exist beyond them. Must these settlers be
perpetually making demands on the public purse
for defending their own possessions > be continu-
ally affecting claims, orasking alms' Is the coun-
try to tax itself that they may be secured in their
possessions5 and aie we to subsidize or pension
every íace of settleis who may find it necessary to
band together for mutual defence' He thinks it
better to retain the principle on which the pension
system was founded, than to have it enlarged so
as to embrace every variety of individual claim,
continued from age to age It should extend no
further than the revolutionary war
The House proceeded, at one o'clock, in accord-
ance to the resolution adopted yesterday, to the
order of the day, being the
REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
motion to refer the Secretary of the Treasury's
report on the deposites to the Corcmiittee of Ways
and Means, and the question being on the amend-
ment submitted by Mi. JONES, as an amend-
ment to that previously submitted by Mr Mc-
DUFF1E, viz to add to the motion for reference
the following instructions to that committee.
" Inquire into the expediency of depositing the
' revenue hereafter collected in the State banks in
'the different States where the same is collected,
' in proportion to their respective capitals paid in,
' and to prescribe the terms on which the same shall
' be deposited, and to report by bill or otherwise "
Mr MOORE, having had the floor from the
previous day, rose and claim°d the right to vote
on this question, untrammelled by party, and with
the single view of promoting what should aopear
to be for the best interests of the country, consid-
ering himself not so much the organ of the senti-
ments of any particular party as a representative
of the whole people. Acting upon this principle,
he would vote, not upon the responsibility of any
party, but upon his own, and for such measures
as would be most conducive to the interests of
those whom he had the honor to represent Be-
fore he would address the House upon the general
subject involved, he wished to explain some cir-
cumstances as to the vote given by him on aformer
occasion, and which explanation he had hitherto
been desnous, but was unable, to make. He had
voted against the motion submitted by the honor-
able member from Ternessee, [Mr. Polk,] foi re-
considering the vote by which thesub]ect had been
referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, because he thought, from the
reasons given in the i eport, the House could judge
whether the Secretary had done right or not in
making the removal, and he desired to have dis-
cussion on the subject in the whole House, that
hei eafter they could act understanding^ and know-
ingly on the subject; for this reason he wished
the debate to go forth to the nation, that they could
come to a right conclusion in this way, rather
than through the corrupt medium of the press,
which, fiom all that appeared, was charged as
being influenced, on the one side, by the Bank of
the United States, and upon the other, by those
State banks who weie interested in pullinf down
that institution He denied that he was°one of
those whom the member fromTennessee had hinted
" was desuousto stifle all debate," and would
maintain that if the subject had been left in the
committee whe e it was first p'aced, the House
could have decided  the question, whilst if they
had desired fuither investigation as necessary for
that purpose, he would have supported ¡'     He
would desire investiga ion, in ordei to act impar-
tially between the bank and the Administration;
and after quoting the various passages from Mr.
Polk's speech, in which " he pledged himself to
' prove that every word contained m the Secreta-
' ry's retjort could be established, if a committee
1 of investigation was appointed," and that he
viewed the conduct of the friends of the bank in
declining investigation " as a departure from the
light of truth," &c , he commented upon them,
and said he could not see what light could have
been shed on the subject that would not be the
same if presented to the House, as to any of the
individuals on the Committee of Ways and Means
1 IJe contended that, so fai from light being desired,
I there was a party made to sustain the views of the
' Secretary, and that the investigation which the
I honorable member from Tennessee, and those with
whom he acted, sought, should not have been for
the purpose of sustaining this or that officer of the
i Government. It was true that gentleman had said
he had no right to impute motives, but he was in-
duced to consider, if he had, what sort of motives
I would  he  have imputed.    That gentleman had
J again said  that the object of those opposed to
| him was, in debating the question, to poui out
I upon the country, through speeches made in that
i House, a torrent of misrepresentation and false-
hood as to the Secretary's report    But it was
easy to see that his object in stifling debate, by
referring it to the Committee of Ways and Means,
was to let the Secretary's report go to the people,
and which afterwards being backed by a repoit
from that committee,which would be in opposition
to the bank, the  peoDle would have been thus
prejudiced against the institution     This was his
object, and the method taken to effect it seemed to
be the same which was taken by the pastors of a
certain religious sect, who, professing to instruct
their flock in the doctrines of Christianity, would
not permit them to look into the Scriotures—into
that inspired book which established it.
He disclaimed any intention of using disrespect-
ful terms towards any officer of the Government,
and would not enter into the question of Mr
Duane'b dismissal, as not properly belonging to the
present discussion, but would merely remarlf, that,
from the tenor of Mr D 's correspondence with
the President, the friends of the Administration
would have some difficulty in showing why he
was originally selected for the office from which he
had been dismissed, however, being put there, he
ought not to have remained m office, under these
circumstances, so long neither ought the Presi-
dent to have dismissed him, solely for having
entertained a diffeient, but honest, opinion, for he
should have known, that m that matter he was the
officer of Congress, not of the Executive Mr M
proceeded to quote various other passages from the
Secretary's report, and contended at length that the
Secretary was not justified in removing any money
from the bank, which, once placed in it, ought not
to have been withdrawn, except by virtue of that
article of the Constitution which provides that no
money should be drawn from the Treasury unless
by appropriations made m conformity to law
There was no power that he knew of conferring
th's right The act of 1«?89 did not give it, that
act only authorized warrants to be issued to draw
money from the Treasury, and had prohibited
eypressly any other interference with the public
money He could not accoid in the precedent
referred to by the Secretary as to Mr Crawford,
for that officer had rather appeared to have acted
as trustee, and by consent, between the bank and
the United States Government Mr M next
referred to the opinion of the Secretai y, as to the
power originally m Congress, but of which the Sec-
retary alleged Congress had divested themselves
by gi anting their charter to the bank, and given it
to him The whole history of the English people
showed that they would not subscribe to such
slavish doctrines, and he trusted that the people of
the United States would not be backward in fol-
lowing their example The origin of parliaments
or representative bodies in England was closely
connected with this very money power    Their
