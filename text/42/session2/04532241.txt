AMERICAN SHIPPING AND SHIP-BUILDING.
Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, the ques-
tion of how best to revive the ship-building
interests and external carrying trade of the
United States is one the correct solution of
which will affect in a great degree both the
material interests of our people and the stand-
ing and importance of this nation in the eyes
of the other nations of the world. Our national
pride, as well as our material interests, is
involved in the solution of this question.
If history has taught one lesson more plainly
than another; it is that those nations which have
excelled in commerce have been marked for
the enterprise, intelligence, and general com-
fort of their people, as well as for their power
as States.
Tyre, Carthage, Egypt, Venice, Genoa, the
citics of the Hanseatic League, and the Dutch
republic, with others that I might name, Were
leaders in the civilization and power of the
world, and took the front rank in their day
in promoting the comfort and elevation of their
peoples, ana spreading around the world the
blessings of civilization.
Sir Walter Raleigh was about right when
he said that—
"Whosoever commands tho sea commands tbo
trade of tho world; and whosoever commands the
trade of the world commands tho richos of tho world,
and the world itself."
It would indeed be difficult to overestimate
the beneficial effects of commerce, not only as
a source of national wealth, but as givingfresh
life to industry and invention, and inspiring
the people who engago in if, with enlarged
views. It has well been said that a nation of
traders can never be a nation of slaves.
ot'R siiirrmu, its risk and fali,.
From the enterprise, energy, spirit, and
ability of our people, and from the physical
characteristics of the country, it would seem
as if no nation could outstrip us in the navi-
gation of tho seas; and no sooner was the
independence of the colonies achieved, than
they began to take that advanced position in
the world of commerce for which they wore so
clearly adapted. To show the progress they
made in the carrying trade of the world, I
give the tonnage of the United States every live
years from 1790 to the present, time as
follows:
Total
Tonnage..
1790   274,377
1795  747,964
1800   972,492
18U5  1,140,868
1810  1,424,784
1815  1,368,127
1820  1,280,16(5
1825  1,423,110
1830   1,191,776
1835  1,824,940
1840   2,180,764
1845  2,417,002
1850  3,535,454
1855  5,212,001

1870   3,940,149
In the beginning of the present century
everything was favorable to the prosperity
of our shipping interests. The nations of
Europe were embroiled in the Napoleonic
wars, and so long as we remained at peace
we had almost a monopoly of the carrying
trade. Having become involved in war with
England, we lost tho great advantage arising
from our neutral position, and the conse-
quences were anything but favorable to our
shipping. It appears, from the foregoing
table, that while in 1810 our tonnage was
1,424,764, in 1830 it was but 1,191,770, so
that in twenty years we absolutely retrograded
in the amount of our tonnage.
By far the most prosperous era for our ship-
ping interests was from 1850 to 1860, daring
which time our shipping increased about two

million tons. From 1851 to 1855 it increased
thirty-eight and a half per cent., while that
of England and her colonies increased only
eighteen and three fourths per cent. These
were the years when our ship-yards turned
out those splendid clipper ships which defied
the ships of all the world besides. These
were years when in every harbor on the globe
could be seen floating the proud banner of the
stars and stripes. Those proud tokens of our
people's greatness were not • placed on the
ocean by Government subsidies wrung from
the sinews of the toiling millions, but by the
enterprise and skill of a free and untramraeled
industry. In those bright days there was no j
whining about being unable to compete with ;
the pauper labor of Europe, and there were
no complaints that our mechanics were infe-
rior to those of England in this department.
Our workmen could outstrip all competitors
in inventive genius and mechanical skill.
In 185!) John Bright said, in the English
House of Commons, that—
"The finest vessels which are at this moment per-
forming the voyage between England and tho Aus-
tralian colonics have boen built in the United
States. In ship-building tho United States not only
compete with, but in somo respects excel this coun-
try," (England.)
In 1854 the returns of the British board of
trade showed the remarkable fact that nearly
sixty per cent, of tho new shipping added to
tho mercantile licet of England was tho work
of North American ship-yards, the British
having bought from us in that year two hun-
dred and sixty-seven vessels. If from 1850 to
1860 were the brightest years in the history of
our commerce, from I860 to 1870 were un-
doubtedly the darkest. While our tonnage in
1861 amounted to 5,539,000, in 1865 it had
sunk to 5,096,000, being a loss of 448,000 tons
during the four years ot war. But during tho
four years since the war it has lost more than
twice that, or 952,000 tons, and the falling off
still continues, showing that some other causes
must be at work to destroy besides the rebel
privateers. Had tho rebel cruisers been tho
only destroyers of sur commerce, as soon as
the war ended, if our ship-building intorests
had beon in a healthy state, our ship-yards
should have manifested renewed activity to
supply tho places of those vessels which had
been destroyed. Instead of that, our ship-
yards are deserted, and ship-building has
become one of the lost arts in our laud.
It is claimed by some that the substitution
of iron for wood has had much to do with the
falling off of our tonnage. Of the fact that
thore has been such a change there can be no
doubt.
According to the London Shippiug Gazette,
Britain during 1870 turned out of her various
yards 974 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage
of 342,706 tons. Of these 483 were steamers,
representing a carrying power of 225,674 tons,
and 541 sailing vessels of 117,032 tons. Four
hundred aud ninety-nine vessels, representing
58,530 tons of measurement, were built of tim-
ber, and 445 vessels of 271,760 tons wore of
iron, while 80 vessels of 12,416 tons were of
composite manufacture. But then this large
percentage of iron vessels is but recent; the
mcreuse in 1870 over the previous year in the
construction of iron vessels as compared to
that of wooden ones was as five to oue.
Now, I believe so great is the invention and
versatility of genius in the American workmen
aud designers, that I have no doubt whatever,
had our builders been left untrammeled, they
would rapidly have accommodated themselves
to any change required in the nature of the
vessels, and by superior skill they wouM have
soon made up for any temporary disadvantage
arising from such a change. Our ship-builders,
however, had no opportunity to. devote them-
selves to building iron vessels. About the
time they should have commenced to do so,
they were crushed down beneath the heavy
and remorseless hand of ill-judged taxation.
If not the rebel pirates, if not the change from
wood to iron were the causes of the destruc-
tion of this industry, let ns see if we can dis-
cover
WHAT DESTROYED OUR SHIP-BUILDING.
In 1867 tho Secretary of the Treasury sub
mitted a report to Congress, wherein is given
tho testimony of a large number of the leading
ship-builders as to the cause of the decline in
our ship-building, and we find the almost
unanimous testimony to be that it was de-
stroyed by over-taxation. One builder said
that in 1864 he built a vessel which cost
$136,000, of which $81,000 was paid for ma-
terial, $30,000 for labor, and S25,000 for taxes
in various forms.
In 1861, just when the new improvements
and changes in tho art of ship-building were
being commenced, just as iron was beginning
to displace wood, under the pretense of pro-
viding revenue, Congress imposed such exor-
bitant taxes on all the material needed for
building a ship that that noble industry, once
our greatest boast, was crushed beneath the
load. Tens of thousands of men employed in
theyards and marine engine works were driven
to other occupations, and ever since our public
men have been asking how pliall wo revive our
shipping.
HOW SHAM, WE KHVIVE OUI£ SIIIl'-BUILDINO?
First. I answer, let us remove the load of
taxation which Congress has imposed and
which Congress should remove. It has boen
said by those who ought to know that wo are
at a disadvantage of thirty per cent, when com-
peting with England in the building of iron
ships. But the tariff on the materials entering
into our ship* is more than thirty per cent.,
and there seetns to be no plan so simple and
easy as to greatly rcduce or wholly remove the
high imposts on all materials which may be
used in ship-building. Such areduetion would
affect the revenue of the country but a very
few millions, and would be a boon of unspeak-
able value in its beneficial effects. I presume
there will come up a terrible clamor from cer-
tain parties who think they are protected by
these imposts which have ruined our shipping.
I would ask these parties if the time will never
come when they will say they have had protec-
tion enough, aud are now willing to stand on
their own feet and let ship-building have a
chance to revive ? For eleven years now has
ship-building been sacrificed for their benefit,
and it is high time that they were willing to
make some concessions, for it really seems as
if we had to ask their permission before we
can do our duty to our shipping by repealing
tho imposts which were laid on in 1861.
Admitting free of duty tho materials used in
ship-buildiug can affect those industries to no
perceptible extent, for at present the demand
of our ship-builders for their productions is
next to nothing, and can hardly be less when
ship-buildiug materials are admitted free.
Nay, more; it is my lirrn belief that some
of those industries which it is feared will be
injured by a repeal of the duties on the mate-
rials to be used in building ships will really be
greatly benefited. Take iron, for instance.
According to the best authorities our iron has
a toughness and a strength and durability not
found in British iron, and is less subject to
oxidation. Now, I am of opinion that if the
materials to be used in ship building are ad-
mitted free it would be more profitable for our
builders to use American iron rather than
the inferior British iron, evenif admitted free;
and I am convinced that our iron interests,
instead of having anything to fear from this
plan, would be greatly promoted.
But the Secretary cf the Treasury says the
cost of labor and interest on capital are greater
hero than in England, and were those duties
reduced we could not competc with tbat coun-
try. But were not wages and interest higher
here than in England in those years when the
clipper ships of Donald McKay beat tho world ,
and when England in one year bought two
hundred and sixty-seven vessels of this Repub-
