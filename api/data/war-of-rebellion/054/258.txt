Dispatches of Charles A. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War.

KNOXVILLE, Tennessee, November 13, 1863-4 p.m.

After detailed conversation with General Burnside, I sum up his

present situation, possibilities, and ideas as follows:

1. There is no reason to believe that any force has been sent from Lee's army to attack him on the northeast.

2. It is certain that Longstreet is approaching from Chattanooga with from 20,000 to 40,000 troops. He already has all the fords

of the Little Tennessee strongly picketed, and is building pontoons on Pond Creek and elsewhere.

3. With Burnside's present forces he is unable to resist such an attack, and the question is how to obviate it, or in case that cannot be done, what is the most advantageous line of retreat.

4. A successful demonstration by Thomas at the mouth of Chickamauga Valley, by throwing a bridge across the Tennessee, fortifying a bridge-head, and displaying a force to threaten the rebel line of communications between Dalton and Loudon, would compel Lonstreet to return and allow Burnside not only to hold his present positions,

but to advance and occupy the line of the Hiwasssee.

5. In case this cannot be accomplished, the addition of 5,000 of

Thomas' cavalry to Burnside's present force would put the latter

in
