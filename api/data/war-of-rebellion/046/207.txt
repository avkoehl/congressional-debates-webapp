stockaded work, containing five or six heavy guns, to bear, a part of them on the channel and a part up the harbor and on the city.

Second. I shall stockade the ditch of Fort Wagner, and render it capable of resisting an assault on all sides.

Third. I shall establish a battery of light guns on light-House Inlet, and cover it by two or three heavy guns, placed in the batteries erected by the enemy on the high bluffs near the inlet. The guns on these bluffs I shall also secure against escalate.

Fourth. I shall place the picket on the hummock between Morris Island and James Island, northwest from the mouth of Light-House Inlet, within a defensive stockade, so that a small force can hold that position.

Fifth. In the defense of Morris Island, according to this project, 3,000 men will be ample.
