AheSPEAKER The report of the committee is now m or

on the table
The reading of the report which had b' en sent to the table by
Mr Saundgrs w*s here loudly called for, and equally loud ob
lections to the reading were made
The SPEAKER here put the inquiry "Has the bill been pre
seiited'i"
Mr BARNARD here rooe and reported a bill remarking that
he did so in obedience to the peremptory ordei of the House,
and under the decision of the bpeaker ai d the House
The SPEAKER announced the first reeding of the bill
Mr WIN I'HROP rose to a point of older He submitted
that the order under which the ^r eaker had ruled in tne report
was exhausted by ¡he net of presentation, and that it was the
duty of the Speaker now to go on with the call of the States for
petitions
Mr HOPKINS called the attention of the Chair to the UOth
rule, which is m the following words
"The fust reading of a bi'l ehallbe for information, andif op-
position be made toil, the question shall be, Shall this bill be
rejected? If no opposition ue made, or if the question to reject
be negatived, the bill shall go its second reading without a ques-
tion "
Mr WINTHROP insisted that the report being presented,
the order of the House had been complied with, and that the
report was now no more than a message or Executive commu
nication lying on the Speaker's table to be taken up when in
Older, and he agim called for the regular oldei of business
Mr UNDERWOOD How do we know this is a bill to i e

to be read that the IIou=e might understand what it wa* The

The bill having been read,
Mr WINTHROP rose and obiei'el ti any ques.uonbi.iDg
taken upon it, ami insiste 1 on his point of oi der
Mr HOPKINS insisled that the question was (objection hav
ing been mailtjShall this bill be rejected? And on that ques
tion he demanded 'he previous question
The SPLAKER said there was a great deal of entina asm
in this matiei for the 11 use, but none for the Chair so ra
pidly did questions of a delicate character anst. one on the
other
The SPEAKER here   ead th  orlpr oi instructions

or if the bill was nov. regularly up for action, that r udd cer

Mr Clay refeired toan opinion which had been thrown out
undei the san Hon of come hi?b ct mmercial authority m New

ope'-atMo throw one hundred milliors worth of property into
themarketto be sacrificed Suchareinaik,coming from that
souice, miehtbe liliely to have some weight Butitmustba
remembeied that the estimate of one hundred millions was
meie assumption a^d random conjecture, lor no man could tell,
with any thng like accuiacy, what the amount would be, it
mi^htiustas welt hive been set down at two hundred millions
a* at one But, be the amount what it might, in estimating the
weight of the * a'ement as an aiguirent against the bill, it
should be mquned on the other hand, what would be done with
this property should the hill n  t go into effect? Would it be
kept out of the market? Not at all On the contiary, it would
bethrowninto the maiket, to be sold und~i the hammer by
sheriffs and other officers executing ¿he process of the courts,
and that without competition to it.ise the puce For, when
the propei ty of a debtor was «eized by one of his crediters,
what mo ive could htaolhercreditors have to enhance us avails,
by compe ition at the sdtpi None in ti e world Onthe con-
trary should the law remain undisturbed, what would be the
course of action uudei it? Accoidingto his understanding of
the act, it would produce a distribution of the goods of
the debtor among all his creditors pío rata, of course,
when his property shou d be Pet up to sale, it would be the inte-
rest of them all to make as much out of it as possible They
wouldbidit up instead of stilitjiing it to be sacrificed for a
son** He considered that, whatever mieht be the exact form
of legal proreeding^incdiijing out the law, the result in prac-
tice would he, that, unctei the benignant operation of the act,
there would ' e a distribution of the debtor's effects, not only
among all his c-edi or<s but at the highest price they could be
male to command
