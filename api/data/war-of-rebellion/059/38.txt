Commanding Third Division, Fourth Army Corps:

SIR: The commanding general directs that "the oldest two veteran regiments" of your division be sent on Thursday next to Strawberry Plainis, to occupy that place until further orders, relieving Hascalls' division, Twenty-third Army Corps, which will move to this point of Friday.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

NEW MARKET, March 8, 1864.

Brigadier General E. E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff, Knoxville:

General Wood reports is doubtful whether some of the regiments which offered to re-enlist as veterans would now do so. He therefore wishes to know more especially whether the prospect is that the veteran furlough will soon be granted the two regiments ordered to Strawberry Plains, so that he may be sure that the ones sent there will certainly re-enlist. Please answer.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Acting Chief of Staff in the Field.

DECATUR, March 8, 1864.

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS:

Brigadier General MORGAN L. SMITH,

Mead and Dillon crossed Tennessee River last night with about 15 guerrillas and took the Bellefonte road. They are now suspected to be in the neighborhood of Boyd's Switch. I will try and watch them from this point, and suggest your doing the same if you think proper.
