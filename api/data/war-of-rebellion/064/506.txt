it must be obvious to Your Excellency that leading conspirators like Charles L. Hunt and Dr. Shore, of Saint Louis, arrested for being implicated in the association, cannot be released without serious hazard to the public welfare and safety.

Major RAINSFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to inclose statement from E. R. Baily, a deserter and rebel. His statement in reference to Freeman and Shelby I expect is correct.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. B. REED,

Captain and Provost-Marshal.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ROLLA,Rolla, June 23, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded, for the information of the major-general commanding.

I think the statement of prisoner in regard to Shelby and Freeman is reliable. I have a rumor from Salem that Shelby is on the Warm Fork of Spring River, with 2,000 men. This is near the south line of Oregon County. I regard this rumor as not altogether reliable, though it is difficult to anticipate when and where Shelby will move.

O. GUITAR,

Brigadier-General.
