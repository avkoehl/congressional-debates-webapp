My thanks are due to Captain H. L. Foules, commanding my escort, and who acted as an aide, and to the officers and men of his admirable company, for their intelligence, activity,and zeal. I have never required a service form the company, nor from any member of it, that was not performed to my entire satisfaction.

In conclusion, I desire to express my humble but most grateful acknowledgments to Almighty God for the signal success that crowned our arms. Greatly outnumbered as we were by a skillful and determined foe, our own strong arms and stout hearts could never have secured to us the victory without the divine favor. Let all the praise be ascribed to His holy name.

Inclosing with this the reports of brigade and regimental commanders, to which I beg to refer for details and for the names of those in their respective commands who entitled themselves to special mention.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. STEWART,

Major-General.

Captain J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Buckner's Corps.

P. S.-The credit of rescuing Carnes' battery, of Wright's brigade, is due to Brown's brigade. The flag of the Fifty-first Tennessee Regiment was recaptured by Bate's brigade.
