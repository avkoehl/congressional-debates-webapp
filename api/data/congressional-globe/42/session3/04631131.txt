Mr. DICKEY. I will answer the question
by stating that that is the exact fact. But
after the 1st day of Afiril there will be no
mail carried on a trunk line in this country in
a postal ear. Is that an answer to my col-
league?
Mr. SPEEIl. It is a kind of answer.
Mr. DICKEY. I think it is a full answer.
I want to say another thing to my colleague,
and it is that the Pennsylvania railroad com-
pany, with whom I have never had any con-
nection in my life, get less per ton per mile
for carrying the United States mails over their
road than they do for carrying coal.
Mr. RANDALL. I am not legislating for
the Pennsylvania railroad company, but for
the country.
Mr. DICKEY. Nor am I; but I am stating
facts. The line between Washington and Bos-
ton get less per ton per mile for carrying the
United States mails and carrying mail agents
free of charge than they get for carrying pig
iron ; and they say that after the 1st of March
next they will go before the people of the
United States and say that they have a right
for carrying the mails and mail agents of the
United States in first-class accommodation
cars to more than they get for carrying pig iron
and coal on trucks.
Mr. SARGENT obtained the floor.
Mr. KERR. I desire to move that the com-
mittee do now rise.
Mr. SARGENT. I cannot yield for that
purpose.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes
the gentleman from California as a member
of the Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. SARGENT. I desire to call attention
to the fact that last session we passed a law
authorizing the Postmaster General to allow
to any railroad company with whom he may
contract for carrying the United States mails
such additional compensation as he may think
fit, not exceeding fifty per cent, upon the con-
tract rates.
Now, the argument of gentlemen is that
although there is a statute on the statute-book
authorizing the Postmaster General to exercise
that discretion, we will refuse to put any ap-
propriation into his hands for that purpose.
The Postmaster General comes to us and
says that he has withstood the pressure as
long as he can; that they are carrying the
mads and six or eight postal agents for a less
price than they carry third-class freight; that
they press the matter on his attention so that
he cannot but admit the justice of their claim,
or stand up against it in defiance of the legis-
lation of Congress.
Now, if he makes this additional allowance,
which will amount to ยง1,500,000, it will con-
stitute a legal claim against the Government,
and you will have to pass a deficiency bill at
the next Congress to carry out the contracts
which the Postmaster General will have made.
Under these circumstances, the Postmaster
General desires that instead of incurring a lia-
bility of $1,500,000, you will regulate the scale
so as to bring the amount within $500,000.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. PALMER. I move that the commit-
tee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr. Burch-
arb reported that the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union had, according to
order, had under consideration the bill (H. R.
No. 3498) making appropriations for the ser-
vice of the Post Office Department for the year
ending June 30, 1874, and had come to no
conclusion thereon.
contumacious witness.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has received
a communication, addressed to the House in
the form of a petition, from Joseph B. Stewart.
What order shall be made in regard to it ?
Mr. BANKS. What is its purport?
The SPEAKER. The Chair has no knowl-
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move that it be
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary,
and printed.
Mr. STEVENSON. I move that it be re-
ferred to the Belect committee of which Mr.
Wilson, of Indiana, is chairman.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. The vote must first
be taken upon the reference to a standing
committee ?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is correct.
Mr. BINGHAM. Cannot the communica-
tion be read, so that we may know what it is ?
Mr. HAZELTON, of Wisconsin. It is too
long; it would take a week.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands
that the petitioner wishes to present a corrected
statement of his testimony.
Mr. SARGENT. Then it ought to go to
the special committee, as it. raises questions
of fact in the possession of that committee
alone.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I will accept the
reference proposed by the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr. Stevenson.]
The SPEAKER. The question, then, is
upon the proposition to order this communi-
cation to be printed, and to refer it to the
select committee of which the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Wilson] is chairman.
Mr. STEVENSON. I did not include in
my motion a proposition to print. โข
The SPEAKER. The proposition to print
was included in the original motion of the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Farnsworth.]
Mr. STEVENSON. The committee can at
any time obtain from the House an order to
print, if they deem it necessary.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Very well; let it
be referred without printing.
No objection being made, the communica-
tion was referred accordingly.

leave of absence.
Mr. Witthorne was granted leave of absence
for ten days from and including Monday next.
Mr. Forker was granted leave of absence
for one week on account of sickness.
Mr. HAZLETON, of Wisconsin. I ask
unanimous consent to offer a resolution call-
ing for information.
Mr. DICKEY. I call for the regular order
of business.
The SPEAKER. The regular order is the
motion of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Garfield,] that the House now adjourn._
The motion was agreed to; and accordingly
(at four o'clock and fifty minutes p. m.) the
House adjourned.
petitions, etc.
The following petitions, &c., were presented
under the rule, and referred to the appropriate
committees:
By Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts: lhe
petition of George T. Adams, for payment of
his proportion of French spoliation claims.
By Mr. LOWE: The petition of John A*
Anderson and others, citizens of Kansas, for
suppression of polygamy in Utah.
By Mr. McCLELLAN D: The petition of
Thomas Mulloy, Edward J. Keenan, John EL
Watson, Josiah Mills, Samuel Adams, H. M.
McKim, and 96 others, citizens of Beaver
county, Pennsylvania, stating that about one
hundred and sixty-five Chinese laborers have
been imported for a cutlery company, located
in the borough of Beaver Falls, in said county,
thereby causing the discharge from the works
of the white American mechanics and work-
men ; that two hundred more Chinese, direct
from China, are said to be engaged and on the
way for the same cutlery and other works of the
same company, to the exclusion from the works
of our own people ; that contracts have been
made, through one of their own race, for loug
periods of servitude on their part, at wages
so low as to forbid competition by American
workmen; that their habits are so debasing as
to insure the demoralization and degradation
of all Christian communities brought in con-
tact with them; that their introduction into
the United States, in the manner it is done,
shows a manifest attempt to revive the insti-
tution of slavery; and that it is an act of bad
faith toward the work people of Pennsylvania
and of the United States, inasmuch as that
the protection of thirty-five to fifty per cent,
against the importation of foreign cutlery was
enacted for the purpose of protecting the
American laborer against cheap foreign labor ;
and asking that as a means, therefore, to be
saved from such evils, and in behalf of their
own work-people, Congress will pass a law
prohibiting any further importation of Chi-
nese laborers under contracts made in China;
or tbat it will authorize the free importation
from foreign countries of such articles or
manufactures as are or may be produced in
the United States by and through Chinese
cheap labor so contracted for.
By Mr. MANSON: The memorial of P.
S. Veder, J. Teague, G. W. Rice, E. Lippold,
Samuel Clark, J. O. Reed, and 80 others,
of Attica, Indiana, praying Congress to make
an appropriation to improve the outlet to the
harbor of Toledo, Ohio, by the construction
of a permanent and direct channel through
the Maumee Bay of sufficient width and depth
to admit vessels of the largest class used in the
lake trade.
By Mr. NIBLACK, of Indiana: The me-
morial of Dr. Thomas J. Swara, of Rockport,
Indiana, praying compensation for expenses
incurred in recruiting men for the United
States service in the State of Kentucky during
the late civil war.
By Mr. PECK: The petition of D. B. Aro-
gree, editor of the Henry County Signal, pro-
testing against any change in the postage
of weekly papers, whether printed in part or
wholly in the county where published.
By Mr. STEVENSON : The petition of the
national banks of Cincinnati, Ohio, relative to
taxation.
