APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBB.

Making public officers depi sitarles—Mr. Norvell.
Mar. 1838.
against this measure, even before it was debated.
It has been denounced, in advance, «s a measme
fraught with tremendous consequences, worse than
all the calamities of a war with the most potent
nation on earth. The denunciation has been daily
repeated by the honoiable Senator from Kentucky,
and by some of his party friends, until, I doubt noi,
they have begun to credit it themselves But, Mr,
in despite of the disposition of parties to receive the
declarations of their leaders with implicit faith,
this measure is gaming ground with the American
people, and the more it is discussed, the more gene-
rally will it come to be viewed as a measure indis-
pensable to the secuiity of the public money, the
stability of business and the currency, and the
purity and safety of our tree Republican institu-
tions
Some years ago, in another pl c«) warmed by
the circumstances and associations mound him, the
Senator from Kentucky pronounced the measuies
of the late President to be woise than wai, pesti-
lence, and famine And what, sir, was the real
fact' The countiy was never more picsperous and
happy than it was under the whole of the adminis-
tration of that illustrious Chief Magistrate No
epoch in lit histoiy was evei more blessed The
only unhappy people were those who aspired to the
honors and emolument of public station, without
success'
The honorable Senator I rom Kentucky predicts
that this measme will lead to consolidation On
the contrary, sir, it sepaiates this Government I rom
the moneyed institutions of the States It takes
from it all the means ol undue influence over them
It establishes a Treasury of its own, with no power
to use or disburse the public funds, except in pur-
suance of approptiationsmade" by law, and itaiiays
against it in all the States a pow ei ful moneyed inte-
rest adverse to the Treasury system, an interest
which has commenced war upon th- s3stt.n1 befóle
it is established, an interest too well calculated, I
fear, to impair the vigor and efficient action oi this
Government
I am glad to find 111 the honoiable Senator tt-
turnmg symptoms ol regard to the íesi ived lights
of the States I had appiehcndt d tint he h id
changed Ins early principles on this sublet t Tin
high tariffs) stem, of which he was the able cham-
pion, embraced within its stope all tin- aiteitsts of
society, individual, State anil Nation il It struck
directly, not thiough the medium of the Si He Go-
vernments, but lmmcdiitely, as it we hid been ,i
consolidated empire, at live pocket , tin business,
the propei t), of every man, woman and child in
the country The great system of internal im-
provement, upon a national scale, was suppotlMl,
if not projected, by that honoiable .Senator That
system would have given boundless cnhiueinmt in
the patronage and power of the General Govt 111-
ment in all the States, menacing not onh dnn.d to
the public liberty, but tin absorption of all tin ic-
sourees of the Treasuiy, the Slates and the peoplt
To these, sn, let us add a nitional bulk, the pn
severing advocacy ol whith has <,„ )<,ng (j stm-
guished the Senator from Kentucky 1 intend to
revive no wai upon the late Bank of the United
States I speak of any national bank, when 1
say that such an institution, opeiating, undtr the
mantle of this Government, upon all the pecuniary
mteiCits of the country, has a consolidating ti n-
dency, and would rerjuite constan! \1g1lat1ce t<
avert or weaken that tendency Sir, I can discovei
in the measme before Us no symptoms of consth-
dation to compare with the tremendous, f -atines of
the system to which I have just adu ited, and
which threatened to extinguish all the reserved
poweis and rights of the States, it not to subject di
the interests ol the people to the unlnn ted council
of the General Government
The honorable Senator fiom Ind ana [Mr Tip-
ton] alleges that this b II i« a conflict between the
friends of a hard money currency and the friends
of a mixed currency The Senator is 1 nstaken
It is a conflict between the friends oi  sptce cir-
rency, or iU equivalent, and the J'iends of an na-
sponsible, unredeemable and uniedeemcd pani r
currency. The supporters of t le measure before
the Senate are lor a policy which will rrmg all
banks up to the specie standard. Its opponents are
foi a surrender of the Government and the curren-
cy into the hands of paper banks, and foi making
both the Government and the people subservient to
bank interests. I do not say, sir, that such is their
design. 1 do say that such, 111 mv judgment, is the
effect of the course which they take
The Senator from Indiana alleges the Specie Cir-
cular to have been one ot the principal causes of
compelling the Western banks toclo.e their vaults.
Sir, I speak from peisonal knowledge when I de-
clare that this was not the case m my quarter of
the West The Westein banks, so far as Michi-
gan at least was concerned, would not have sus-
pended specie payments jf the suspension bv (he
New York banks had not compelled them to fol-
low Iheexarnple The banks were certainly pressed
They were pressed by th*u excesses m business,
not by the Tieastuy Oirculni They weie piessed
m consequence of undue loans to speculators, to
favoied individuals—in too many instances to then
own officers and direcmis
The honorable Senate  (10m Kentucky [Mi
Cr at) has affnnietl, that it was the dchheiate piu-
po e ol the late Admtmsli.Uion to establish a Go-
vernment bank, under the exclusive conliol and
ditecuon ot the r.xeculive department. In pioofoi

reset t.l 1 "his ol the Slates, he admits that, if
cal'ctl upon, the "^ecntiv" vou'd h*\e furnished
such a project, but he does not say that he would
have recommended aUovunmcni bank, under the
control and direction of the Executive department
At the veto message, the honorable Senator from
Kentucky discontinued his quotations from the
late President on, this subject. Had he pursued
them to a later date, he would have disclosed to this
body and to the people, what rt might not have
suited his argument to disclose, that General Jack-
son had, upon long experience and mature dehbe-
1 ation, come to the conclusion, that any Bank of
the United States was neither necessary nor consti-
tutional. In his sixth annual message, he fervent-
ly hopes that, "admonished by the evils and dis-
tresses inflicted by such an institution, those who
have favored the establishment of a substitute for
Ihe present bank, will be induced to abandon it,"
as any inconvenience would be preferable to this
concentration of the whole moneyed power of the
Republic, in any form, or under any restrictions.
In his seventh annual message, the late President
declares, that " the experience of another year has
confirmed the utter fallacy of the idea, that the
Bank of the United States was necessary as a fiscal
agent of the Government," and that such a bank
is " one of Ihe fruits of a system at war with the
genius of all our institutions." In the eighth and
last annual message oí the lllustnous chieftain, he
impiessively remarks, that " the lessons taught
by the Bank oí the United States cannot well
be lost upon the American people. They
will take care never again to place so tremendous
a power m irresponsible hands; and it will be fortu-
nate if they seriously consider the consequences
which are likely to result, on a smaller scale,«from
the faculty with which coiporate powers are
ga anted by their State Governments " Finally, in
the farewell address of the late President, he so-
lemnly declaies that " the powers enumerated m
the Constitution do not confer on Congress the
liaht to establish sucha corporation as the Bank
ol ihe United States, and the evil consequences
which followed may wain us of the danger of de-
parting from the true rule of construction, and of
permitting temporary circumstances, or the hope
ol belter promoting the public welfare, to influ-
ence, 111 any degree, our decisions upon the ex-
tent of the authority of the General Government.
Let us abide by the Constitution as it rs written,
oi amend it in the constitutional mode, it it is
found defective."
It will, from this connected view of the opinions
of the late President, appear that, while during his
first term he entertained a vague and doubtful idea
that some bank might be constitutionally establish-
ed, his opinions during the second term lent no
countenance to that idea. He entirely repudiated
both the necessity and constitutionality of any bank
established by this Government, and he retired
fiom that public life, which he had adirned with
so much public vntue and firmness, warning his
countrymen to abide by the Constitution, on this
very^subject, as it is written
M lie Senator has, therefore, completely failed to
establish his position, that it wjs the settled purpose
of the late Administration to establish a Govern-
ment bank, under the direction and control of the
Executive department
Having failed, sir, to establish this position, he
has still moie signally miscarried in his effort to fix
upon the pit, sent Administration tne same purpose.
It the present Executive has succseded to the prin-
ciples an 1 policy of the late Piesident, and does
stand plcelged to cany them out, I have conclusive-
ly shown that a Government bank, under the con-
trol oí the Executive department, constituted no
pait ol those prmcip'es or that policy. But weare
not left to conjectuie or inference upon this point
The present President of the United States came
into power with the declaration upon his lips, that
he deemed any Bank of the United State? to be un-
constitutional In his September message he rei-
terated the kindled declaration, that "again to cre-
ate a National Bank, as a fiscal agent, would be to
disregard the popular will, twice solemnly and un-
equivocally expressed " In his lecent message he
has again reitei died the same sentiment, and we
¡nu e all along had his own distinct intimation that
he would sign no bill establishing any National
Hank
But, says the honorable Senator from Kentucky,
the bill before the Senate is intended to execute the
purpose of establishing a Government Bank upon
