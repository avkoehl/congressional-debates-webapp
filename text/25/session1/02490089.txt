not, have an absolute ti'le to the fourth instalment,
j et tl ey liad an equitable title to it ]
The gentleman's statement corresponds with my
recollect on The argument s still the «ame Ken-
tucky holds, in common v,nh the other States, the
bond of this Government, which 1-. the act of
1836, to pay tKe fourth instalment When it is
rtdeemed by payment, the t tie oí the States to
the money paid is complete Sir, this is m effect an
avowal of the principle oí distiibuüen I know
the doctrine is oppnlv avowed. Had this principle
been asseited eitner tn tne act of deposite, or bj
tho e who brought it íorwaid, the mark of the first
murderer would have been stamped unon its foie-
head Every man's hand wou'd have been against
H The act pi,rpom upon its face to be a de-
po«ilc act It is the first rule of construction that
"i/o« aie not allowed to interpret that which has no
need oj mleipi elation " The gentleman from Ken-
tucky, vtrsed as he is 111 legal learning, can find
no rule in the books by which he is authorized to
construe a lorn fe 1 a term of >ears, or at will, to a
gift in fee simple It would be dnectlv in the
teeth of the instrument, and unhinge the founda-
tions of all human agreements But if the act itself
condei ins such an interpretation, equa'Iy strong is
the aigumtnt from the certificates of the Slates,
plighlin r then fail! upon the face of those nis'i uments
to pay the amounts received accoidmg to the terms
prescribed in the deposi e act If anv argument
could be adduced stronger than another ti jus-

for that pait ol the laws of nature and of nations

vested lights undei legislative enactments, 01 of pto-

aspect, and threatens, unless speedily checked, lo

is by vuttie of this doctrino, s r, that the ag (cul-

this kind' Docs it form an exception to the gene-
ral law of legislative repeal? I think not In the
first place, Congress has no authonty to borrow
money, or tax the people to place on deposite with
the States, when no1 demanded bj ihe wants ol the
Government In the second, th^re are no words

of ihe United Slates, to supply any deficiency

however, tiounle the house with any remarks of"
mine, were it not for what the honorable gentle-
man from New York, the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means (Mr Cambreleng) had
said m regard to those who might vote for this
amendment He said, sir, if I understood hnn,
that any man w ho might vote for it, and, at the
same time, being a hearty opponent of the Bank
oí the Uniled States was wanting in «agacity
Sir, I mean to tote foi the amendment of the gen-
llmian from Kentucky, and also for the addition
to tha amendment offered by mj colleague, and
I thought 1 liael sagacity enough to know that it
will have no tendency to recharter that bank li
it has any suth tendency, I would be glad to be
informed how, and w ill go against it The gen-
tleman from New York has not shown how He
1 as shown that if anv profit can be made, the Bank
of the United States of Pennsjlvania will make it
This I knew If theie be any piofit to be made
of consequence, that bank, or some bank, or some
capitalist or some association ol capitalists, will
make 11    But 'hat is no a ic charter of the bank
Sir, I am against a Bank of the United States,
from the heart outward I am not one of those
who wou'd have the constitution altered to allow

against a Bank of tht United States, will ransack
