THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ment stopped the work. The contract, as is
usual in such cases, reserved twenty per cent,
to be paid to the contractor in case the work
should be stopped. When this work was stopped
by the Government Sir. Fowler applied for the
twenty per cent., and it was refused to him.
After the work had been delayed two or three
years the Government asked him to go forward
and complete it under his contract. Mr. Fowler
at first declined to do so, because prices had
so risen that the completion of the work would
cost him double what it would have cost if it
had not been delayed. Ho was told that if he
would go forward and complete the work he
would be reimbursed for the increase in the
prices of material, &c. The late Senator Foot,
chairman of the Committee on Public Build-
ings, assured him that if he would resume and
complete the work he would, on its comple-
tion, introduce a bill to compensate him for
the increased expense incurred by reason of
the delay.
The old gentleman, relying on this, went for-
ward to complete his contract in the best pos-
sible manner. Senator Foot introduced a bill
in the Senate. On examination it was found
that the old gentleman had lost over one hun-
dred thousand dollars, and the committee of
the Senate came to the conclusion that sixty-
odd thousand dollars was the amount which
iron had risen while he was delayed in the
work. The committee reported the bill. It
passed the Senate unanimously. It came to
the House. The Committee of Claims, the
chairman of which at that time was Mr. Del-
ano, unanimously agreed to give this man that
amount of $60,000. The time ran out and the
committee could not report it. So the bill has
laid over to the present session. This gentle-
man has lost everything he had. He is an
old gentleman. I pay it is but just that we
should appropriate this much to pay him. I
a<-k the House to pass the bill so that it may
bosent to the Senate and become a law. It has
been delayed some four or five years already.
He has not trusted to claim agents. He said
t ho claim was so just that he would not ask any
cue but Congress to consider it. The Commit-
tee of Claims, therefore, havenotbeen troubled
by any claim agents on the subject. This money
is fairly due this man, and I move the bill be
reported to the House with the recommenda-
tion that it do pass.
The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman
move that the bill be laid aside ?
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
move that the committee rise and report the
bill to the House.
