YORKTOWN, VA., August 22, 1863.

General NAGLEE,

Norfolk:

All my cavalry parties have returned. They have scoured the country on this side the Chickahominy for 15 miles from Williamsburg. All the rebel scouts or pickets hitherto permanently kept in our front were withdrawn within two days and sent to Richmond. The last, 12 in number, passed Twelve-Mile Ordinary last evening at sunset, going to Richmond. This statement was uniformly made by all. i shall have reliable information from Richmond within a few days from another source.

General Wistar advise me that all the rebel cavalry pickets for 15 miles in his front have been withdrawn to Richmond.

NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General.

[FORT MONROE, VA., August 22, 1863] - 10. 30 a. m.

General NAGLEE,

Norfolk:

I leave the matter to your judgment and discretion. The only objection that I can see to that course is that if there is anything serious, there may not be time to get the regiment into position. But of this have no doubt estimated carefully.

I have received your second telegram, and will ask the navy to send a gunboat. Is the General Jesup at Norfolk? If so, send her up.

Major-General, Commanding.
