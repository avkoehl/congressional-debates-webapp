to a third reading, read the third time, and
passed.
MINNESOTA STATE UNIVERSITY.
Mr. HBNDlliCIvS. I move to lake up Sen-
ate bill No. 555, icpurted from the Committee
on Public Lands. It is a bill that involves
simply the construction of two statutes. The
committee gave a good deal of attention to it,
and came to what they deemed the right con-
elusion.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.
No. 555) authorizing the allowance of the
claim of the State of Minnesota to lands for
the support of a State university was read the
second time, and considered as in Gommittee
of the Whole. It is a direction to the Com-
missioner of the General Land Office, in ad-
justing the claim of the State of Minnesota to
lands i'or the support of a State university, to
approve and certify selections of land, made
by the Governor of that State, to the full
amount of seventy-two sections, mentioned in
the act of Congress approved February 26,1857,
without taking into the account the lands that
were reserved at the time of the admission of
the State into the Union and donated to that
State by the act of Congress approved March
2, 1861.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered
to be engrossed for a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.
BKNJAMIN B. FKENCII.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I wish to take up a
little bill on the table, as that seems to be the
fashion. The bill has already passed the House.
It is a bill for the relief of B. 13. French. I
move to take it up.
The motion was agreed to ; and the bill (H. 11.
No. 132-3) for the relief of Benjamin B. French,
late Commissioner of Public Buildings, was
consideied as in Committee of the Whole. It
pruvidesforpayingto BenjaminB. French,late
Commissioner of Public Buildings, for service
performed from the 2d to the 1-ith day of March,
1867, inclusive, for which he has not been
heretofore paid, the sum of eighty-five dollars.
Mr. IIO WARD. I should like to have some
explanation of that little bill from the Senator
from Maine. How does it happen that eighty-
live dollars is due to Mr. French as a balance?
He has got rather rich out of the public em-
ployments he has held, I understand.
_ Mr. FESSENDEN. The explanation is
simply this: after he ceased to be Commis-
sioner of Public Buildings, on account of the
passage of a law abolishing the office, it was
deemed necessary that he should remain there
until the officer designated to take charge of
the place could take possession, and he stayed
there at the particular request of the Secretary
of the Interior to take care of the books,
pap.ers, &c. This is to allow him the same
rate that he had before lie received a salary, for
the time he thus stayed.
Mr. HOWARD. Does he say that he could
not verv well afford to do that little duty with-
out additional compensation?
Mr. FESSENDEN. We know that men
generally accept pay for what they do.
Mr. HOWARD. I asked the Senator if Mr.
French had expressed any wish on the sub-
ject?
Mr. FESSENDEN. I have not had any
conversation with Mr. French. T have reported
the bill from the testimony before the commit-
tee that he performed the service at the request
of the Secretary of the Interior, and that the
service was valuable and necessary.
Mr. HOWARD. I suppose that is all the
information we can get.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered
to a third reading, read the third time, and
passed.
PRIVATE BILLS.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that the Senate
adjourn.
Mr. HOWE. I wish the Senator would
withdraw that motion, and allow me to have-
a few little private claims passed. We can
administer a good deal of relief now.
Mr. fllUMBULL. I submit to my friend
from Wisconsin whether we ought not to ad-
journ?^ The hour is late, and the Senate is
very thin.
Mr. HOWE. I know there is a thin Senate,
but the business which I have in hand to-day
I can do just as well where there are two or
three met together. [Laughter.]
Mr. TRUMBULL. Does the Senator from
Wisconsin think it' best to go on with this busi-
ness? If he insists on it, I shall withdraw
the motion ; but I fear that after he gets his
business through some other business will be
taken np that perhaps ought not to be passed.
Mr. HOWE. I should be very much obliged
to the Senator if he would withdraw the mo-
tion.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Very well.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pome-
koy in the chair.) The motion to adjourn is
withdrawn.
TIMOTHY LYDEN.
Mr. HOWE. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House bill No. 445.
The motion was agreed to ; and the bill (H.
R. No. 445) for the relief of Timothy Lyden,
of Parkersburg, West. Virginia, was considered
as in Committee of the Whole. It provides
for the payment to Timothy Lyden of $302, in
compensation of services rendered in the quar-
termaster's department, and for a period of
captivity in rebel prisons.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered
to a third reading, read the third time, and
passed.
ROBERT FORD.
Mr. HOWE. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of Senate bill
No. 550.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.
No. 550) for the relief of Robert Ford was
rpad the second time, and considered as in
Committee of the Whole. It proposes to
appropriate $814 to Robert Ford, in full pay-
ment for his time and services as a teamster
in the quartermaster's department of the Army,
from May 1, 1802, to August 1, 1864.
Ttie bill was reported to the Senate, ordered
to be engrossed for a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.
PALEHON JOHN.
Mr. HOWE. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House bill
No. 433.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (H.
R. No. 433) for the relief of Palemon John
was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to instruct the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to allow Palemon John a
credit for the sum of $709 37, for that amount
of revenue stamps lost or stolen from the
mails while the same were in transit to the
Commissioner from Palemon John, late rev-
enue stamp agent.
The hill was reported to the Senate, ordered
to a third reading, read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. BUCKALEW afterwards said: I desire
to enter a motion to reconsider a bill passed a
short time since, House bill No. 433. I do not
know but that it is all right; I want to look at
the papers.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The mo-
tion to reconsider will be entered.
SALLY C. NOItTIIROP.
Mr. HOWE. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House bill No.
722, for the relief of Sally C. Northrop.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN. That is a land-warrant case.
I am inclined to think that it is an old case
that has been rejected heretofore. I think it
better that the Senator would let that go over.
Mr. HOWE. If the Senator wishes to
examine it, I move to postpone it.
The motion was agreed to.
CLAIMS AGAINST AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT.
Mr. HOWE. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House bill No.
1068.
The motion was agreed to ; and the bill (H.
R. No. 1068) to provide for certain claims
against the Department of Agriculture was
considered as in Committee of the Whole.

the bill by striking out all after the enacting '
clause, in these words:

culture shall hereafter, in the name of the United
States, or in the name of said Department, contract
ior any goods or services lor the use thereot beyond
the amount of money appropriated and remaining

contract, tho officer so offending shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor in office, and upon convic-
tion thereof shall be punished by fine not exceeding
$5,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding two years,
or both, at the discretion of the court.
Mr. HENDRICKS. That appears to be a
combination of a bill of particulars and a crim-
inal code. I think the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Claims ought to explain that, If we
stand by the criminal provisions we had better
strike out the bill of particulars. If we stand
by the bill of particulars we bad better strike
out the criminal provisions.
Mr. HOWE. I think -we had better lake
them both.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment was concurred in. The
amendment was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, and the bill to be read a third
time. The bill was read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I move that the Senate
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.
