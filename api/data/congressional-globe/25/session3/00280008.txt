was to compel the Postmaster General to carry
into effect an award made by the Solicitoi of the
Treasury, undei a special act of Congi ess for the
settlement of certain claims of the relators on the
Post Office Department, which award the Post-
master General declined to execute in full, until
he should receive fuither legislative direction on
the subject If the duty imposed on the Post-
mastei General, by that law, was to be regarded
as one of an official nature, belonging to his office
as a branch of the Executive, then it is obvious
that the constitutional competency of the Judi-
ciary to daect and control mm in us discharge
was necessarily drawn in question And if the
duty so imposed on the Postmaster General was
to be consideied as merely ministerial, and not
executive, it yet remained to be shown that the
circuit court of this District had authority to in-
terfere by mandamus —such a power having never
before been asserteu or claimed by that court
With a view to the settlement of these important
questions, the judgment of the cncuit couit was
carried, by a writ of error, to thcSupieme Court
of the United States In the opinion of that tri-
bunal, the duty imposed on the Postmaster Gen-
eral was not an official, executive duty, but one
of a merely mmisteiinl nature The giave con-
stitutional qiitsttons which had been discussed
weie, therefoie, < xehtdtd from the decision of the
case, the couit, indeed, expiessly admitting that,
with poweisnnd duties properly belonging to the
Executive, no othei dipaitrnmt nn mteifere by
the writ of ranndimus, and the question, theie-
fore, íesolved itself into tin's has Connies1? con
ferred upon the cncuit touit of this Distnct the
power to issue s,ucli a wnt to an ollutrof the
Geneial Government, tinnin imling him to pei-
form a mimstuiAl uct? A mnjouty of th court
have decided that it has, but have founded their
decision upon a piocess of leasoncng which, in
myjudgment, lenders fuithi 11< giUattvi piovision
indispensable to the public interests and the equal
administration of justicí
It has long smct been decided by the Supreme
Court, that neither that tubuiml nor tile circuit
courts of the United Stiles hi Id within tin ie~
epective States, poised the powi i in qmition,
but it is now held that tina powi r, dome d to both
of these high tribunals—to tin loinm by the
Constitution and to the latti r by Congn «i«s—has
been, by its legislation, vi iud m tin i mint couit
Of this iJistm t JNo such timet «ant of power
to thtcuiuit mint of this Disiu t is ilmnitd
but it has Ik i n held in ic suit, by in cc ssny lm
plication, from f. \e i il m i turns' ol ti i law i stab-

In England, the Couit of King's Bench—be-

It has been held, in thi rise n fe in d to, that, as
the Supreme Court of tin United Sta 11 is-, by
the Constitution, ui di itd mconipc ti lit to ixii-
rise this powci.and as tilt menu couit of this
District i« a court of gt neral junstlii  ion m c isi t,
at common law, and the highest couit ot on-
gina! jumdiction in the Distnct, the n,l f to is
sue the wut of mandamus is inn lent to its com
mon law powois, Another giound lehoel upon
to maintain the power in question is, that it was
included, by fair construe tion, in the powei it
granted to the cncuit courts of the United States
by the act " to piovide for the more convenient
organic mon of iht courts of the United States,"
paswl Jjthofr biuuy, 1801 that the act estab-.
Iishing Die cncuit touit of this District, passed
the 27th d y of Vebrnaiy, 1801, onfured upon
that court and the ji<d"es thcieof the same pow-
is as were bylaw vested in the cncuit coin ts of
he United S ites and m the judges of the said
onus, that the repeal of the ¡list mentioned act,
which took place in the next year, did not divest
the circuit court of this District of the authority
in dispute, but left it still clothed with the powers
over the subject which, it is conceded, were taken
away from the circuit courts of the United States
by the repeal of the act of 13th February, 1801
Admitting that the adoption of the laws of
Maryland for a portion of this District confers on
the circuit court thereof, m that portion, the trans-
cendent extra-judicial prerogative powers of the
Court of King's Bench, in England, or that either
of the acts of Congress, by necessary implication,
authorize the former court to issue a writ of man-
damus to an officer of the United States, to com-
pel him to perform a ministerial duty, the conse-
quences are, in one respect, the same. The result
in either case is, that the officers of the United
States, stationed in diffeient parts of the United
States, are,m respect to the performance of their
official duties, subject to diffeient laws and a dif-
feient supei vision, those in the States to oneiule,
and those in the Distnct of Columbia to another
and a %ery different one In the District their
official conduct is subject to a judicial control,
from which, in the States, they aie exempt
Whatevei difference ot opinion may exist as to
thee xpediency of vesting such a power m the
judicial y, in u system of Government constituted
like that of the United States, all must agree that
these dispaiaging disciepancies in the law and in
the admuiis-tiation of justice ought not to be pei-
mitted to continue, and as Congiess alone can
provide the leniedy, the subject is unavoidably
piesented to yom consideiation
