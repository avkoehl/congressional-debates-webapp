HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Tunnel Hill, May 12, 1864-3.45 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The rebels marched out a column of cavalry, infantry, and artillery-about 10,000 strong-just east of the fort on Potato Hill. Another column, composed of cavalry, footmen, and some wagons, passed up the Dalton and Cleveland road a little past 9 o'clock this a. m. I sent the two brigades of Wood on Tunnel Hill to Newton's left. After making a display in front of Newton and Wood the larger force returned eastward and finally toward Dalton. The raiding party may be aiming at Cleveland or Ringgold. Stoneman sent a portion of his force toward Lee's house to head off the party. I have also sent a regiment of cavalry and a section of artillery direct to Ringgold to aid in defending that place. The troops at Cleveland, Julian's, McDonald's [McDaniel's], and Parker's Gaps were noticed to be on the lookout. The whole was undoubtedly a diversion, as I suspected at first. I delayed General Geary through misinformation, having been told by a staff officer that he had not left camp. As soon, however, as I was satisfied of the rebel's intentions I sent him word to go on.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
