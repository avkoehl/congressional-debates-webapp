Brigadier-General BUSSEY,Fort Smith:

Rebel soldiers reporting without arms will be permitted to go to their homes. Surrenders imply that arms are laid down. Where no arms are surrendered no notice should be taken officially. We have discovered a disposition to secrete arms and at the same time come in to secure a certificate of parole as a protection against further demands upon them. These certificates are at a premium now. Rebel General Dockery has just left here after concluding an agreement to surrender all forces and arms in the State on the 20th instant at Monticello, Camden and Washington.

By command of Major-General Reynolds:

JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
