These shops were supplied with machinery partly seized or purchased in the country and partly obtained from Northern manufacturers.

The shops at nashville, particularly, were on a large scale, as at times 100 engines and more than 1,000 cars were there at once, it being the main terminal station of 500 miles of road running from it east, south, and west. Extensive store-houses were also built at Nashville and Chattanooga, and kept supplied with all necessary materials to rebuilt or repair track bridges, buildings, engines, or cars to any reasonable extent.

The general intention was to make these two cities the great centers toward which all operations should converge; where supplies of all kind could be obtained in case the roads were cut in their rear; where repairs of any kind or to any extent could be made, and in case communication was destroyed between them, operations could be conducted from either with facility in any direction.
