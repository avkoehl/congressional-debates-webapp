Brigadier-General STANLEY,

(Care Major-General Crittenden.)

There is a cavalry force of between 3,000 and 4,000 foraging on the Hardin and Hillsborough and Charlotte pike. You had better be prepared to bag them.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 23, 1862.

Major-General THOMAS:

GENERAL: The enemy are reported in strong force within 10 miles of Gallatin, on Bledsoe's Creek; 10,000 cavalry, and, perhaps, infantry. Have troops in readiness by daylight, with three days' cooked rations on their persons, for a march. Cause arrangements to be made for your trains, in accordance with orders already given. The enemy will probably make a demonstration with the Gallatin movement. The intention is to make him pay for it. Will you please notify Woodruff's brigade and the brigade of regulars near you?

I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

Special says 7,000 infantry, with artillery, skirmished in front of Nashville this morning. Enemy's pickets driven in at several points; further results not known. Yesterday Morgan, with old regiments, crossed the Cumberland at Cunningham's Ford; came near lines, and retreated without attacking. Duke's and Bennett's rebel cavalry above Hartsville, this side river. Unreliable, no doubt.

Major-General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I think the enemy as far committed to stand at Murfreesborough, to protect the raid into Kentucky, as they will be; and, having now the essentials of ammunition and twenty days' rations in Nashville, shall move on them to-morrow morning at daylight. If they meet us, we
