of revenue which will be received from imports
during the year 1836 will probably be from one
to two millions Ir*s than in 1835. If we look for-
ward to lc-43, whi n the find is, bv our present
law -. '0 undergo n great e lunsrc.aiid it we regard,
in the intervening time, tlio piobable exports of
domestic produce and imports of foreign mer-
chandise, or the presumed consumption of that
small portion of the latter paying duties, it may
fairly be concluded that, after making due allow-
ances as to all these, on account of our increasing
population and wealth, and deducting those al-
low anees from the biennial reduction, not only
will the revenue accruing from customs probably
dimmish at the average rate of about one third
of a million per annum, or near two thirds of a
million every second year, until the 1st of Jan-
uary, lr>4J, but then, at one blow, over two and
a half millions more of the duties above twenty
per cent, are to be struck off; and on the 1st ol
Jiiiv, the same vear, over two and a half millions
more, and some new articles, for the first time, be
rendered entirely free. All the reduction which
is to take place in that vear alone will thuB
amount o between file and six millions of dol-
lars; and the whole annual revenue from customs
will, by 1843, have probably fallen to about nine,
instead of it* present amount of about seventeen
millions of dollars.
Explanation   of ike  Estimates  of Receipts from
Lands.
The revenue from lands the ensuing year has
been estimated at (4,000,000. In submitting the
estimates for lb35, the amount expected to be re-
ceived from this source, was, for reasons then
stated, calculated half a million higher than it had
ever been before, and was described as still too
low, if the Department had not anticipated that
large sales would be made for the Indians, the
proceeds of which were not to go into the Treas-
ury for public uses. But these last, sales, delayed
till the first month in the next year, have unex-
pectedly given place toothers, all whose proceeds
nave so gone into the Treasury. This chonge,
with the operation, in such unexampled force, of
the circumstances detailed in those reasons, aided
by such an eager thirst for the investment of sur-
pluscapital in new lands, and the bright prospects
of large profits from their immediate cultivation
for cotton in the southwest, with the extraor-
dinary number of preemption claims allowed, has
caused the ac'ual receipts from their sales during
the year 1835 to exceed those of any previous
year, by the sum of probably more than six mil-
lions of dollars.
From the fact that many of these sales have
not been made to actual settlers, and that much
of the land thus sold wtll remain in the market I
to aid in supplying hereafter such ¡piírchater ^.
from the probability that some dicninution in the I
price of cotton, with the increased *oat of labor, i
will lessen somewhat the ardor for new invest-
ments in land in the southwest—front the circum-
stances that much fewer preemption claims exist,
and that fewer public sales of lands whose pro-
ceeds belong to the Government, by over two
millions of tens, will be advertised the ensuing
year—and from the presumption that the surplus
capital to be reinvested, derived from the final
payment of our public debt, and from the unu-
sually great exports the last two year , wall be
reduced, it has not been deemed safe to estimate
the receipts, for public purposes, from sales of
land in 1836, at more than #4,000,000.
Besides those receipts, the sales-of the Chicka-
saw lands, postponed, as before remarked, to the
ensuing year, will probably be considerable, as i
the quantity offered will be about six millions of
acres; and though by treaty, the proceeds Of them j
must be invested for the Indians, yet the sales will,
tó their extent, diminish the demand for other I
lands, whose proceeds would go into the Treas- '
vary.    In looking beyond the next and a few suc-
ceeding years, as connected with this subject, it
is true that the whole lands still owned by the
United States, within the boundaries of the present
States and Territories, exceed the vast quantity
of three hundred and thirty millions of acres; ana,
west of Missouri and Arkansas, perhaps seven
hundred and fifty millions more, of which only
seventy or eighty millions hare yet been specially
assigned to the Indians, oi in any othei way ab-
solutely appropriated. But though three hundred
and thirty millions of ncies would alone bo enough
m quantity, at even the rate ot the recent laige
sales, to continue, tor a considerable time, to yield
an important share of ievenue,it must be remem-
btred that the demand for it will be limited gen-
erally by the extent oí the increase of our popu-
lation and capital: and that laige portions of it,
perhaps one fouith, ought to be dtemed waste
and water; and probably half of it, as well as
much of that which lies west of the present
States and Territories, be considered of such an in-
ferior quality, that it cannot be sold for cultnation
till our population reaches an amount and den-
sity which will probably requite ages to effect.
In illustration of some of these views, it is a re-
markable fact, that, of the whole quantity of land
sun eyed and offered at public sale, from 1789 to
1834, being about one hundred and twenty-two
millions of acres, not one third of it has betn
sold for any pui pose whatever; and that the whole
receipts, being a little undei fitty millions ot dol-
íais, tioni the whole sales of public lands during
that period, have furnished only a small amount,
not exceeding three or four millions of net reve-
nue, beyond the whole cost, in vanous ways,
attending their purchase and management.
But a considerable net revenue from them,
hereafter, if neither given away nor divided, can
w.th safety be expected, and they would then
tend to furnish that relief under the common bur-
dens, arid that aid towards the common and legit-
imate objects of the Union, which wereintended
to be piomoted by their original cession to the
General Government. The present rate of in-
crease in our population engaged in agricultural
pursuits will not, it is presumed, for six or seven
years, create a regulai annual demand for immedi-
ate cultivation of over one million of acres of the
public lands; and it is calculated that from two to
four millions more will be bought yearly for in-
vestment of capital and resale.
The estimate for that time pi oceeds on the prob-
able presumption that no very laige portion of
our old cultivated lands will bo wholly abandoned,
and that the new lands annually put into cultiva-
tion in the whole Union have been, and will be,
to the amount of quite one half those bought by
the actual settlers, not directly of the United
States,but of the several States, or of individual
owners. As the wild lands owned by several of
the States, and by companies or individuals,
whether belonging to them through gift, sale, or
otherwise, from either former Governments or the
United States, shall increase or dimmish in quan-
tity and price, the new sales by the United States
are likely to be less or more, and the above pro-
portions to become by those, as well as by numer-
ous other circumstances, some w hat affected. The
whole safes of public lands for speculation and
investment, as well as for immediate cultivation,
will, theiefore, from various causes, some of
which have already been specified, probably fluc-
tuate between two and five millions of acres, pro-
ducing from three to six millions of dollars a year,
till 1842, and indeed not often exceeding the
maximum till most of the rich soils*are gone.
A document has been carefully preponed, (F,)
which, in some degree, verifies these general
views, as it shows that the whole sales to the
close of 1834, deducting about six and one third
millions of acres, which reverted under our former
system, have only been about thirty-seven and a
half millions of acres during forty-ivo years, or
on an average only of about three fourths of a
million of acres yearly, for immediate cultivation
and every other purpose. This quantity sold,
with about sixteen millions given away as boun-
ties in the last war, and for schools, colleges, in-
ternal improvements, and othei public objects in
the new States, being together almost half as
much as all the States would, through the whole
time, be taking from the public lands by both gift
and sale, and for all purposes, little more, if any,
when compared with our population and the ad-
ditions to it at different periods, than three mil-
lions of acres would annually be now. It may
be instructive, in respect to the estimate of our
future proceeds from lands, to recollect that after
the present system commenced, the sales never
amounted in fact to one million of acres a year i
till 1815, nor fo two millions a year till the tempt-
ations of the credit system, and the great rise in
the price of cotton to twenty-six and thirty-four
cents per pound, induced larger purchases, ex-
tending to over two mil'ions of acies in 1817,
and about five and a half millions in 1819; and
thus even fifteen veais ago exceeding in quan-
tity, by nearly a million ot acres, the laige sales
of 1834, and exceeding them in the sum prom-
ised to be paid by the almost incredible amount
of more than twelve millions of dollars. But the
fall of cotton in 1820, to only about half its
former price, combined with other causes, left
the purchasers in debt to the Government over
twenty-two millions of dollars, and with the
change from the credit to the cash system, re-
duced the sales again to much less than a million
of acres a year, caused nearly six millions of the
former sales to revert, and kept them down to
less than a million in every year after, till the rise
of cotton in 1825 gave a new impulse, which be-
ing aided by other powerful causes, the sales
gradually enlarged till they reached a million
again in 1829. Since that, increasing still more
rapidly, they have exceeded, during 1834, four
millions of acres, and during 1835, probably nine
millions. Among those other causes, the more
extensile introduction of steam power on the
western rivers and northern lakes, with the pub-
he improvements in their navigation, and the in-
creased facilities of intercourse by railroads and
canals, have of late added much to the sales of
the public lands beyond previous years, and be-
yond the proportional increase of population.
To the force of this, causes have been joined,
during the last three years, as formerly suggest-
ed, the effect of the pre-emption law, the increase
in the price of cotton, and the unusual abund-
ance of surplus capital in 1835, seeking new in-
vestments. But much of the great difference to
be produced by these causes has, perhaps, hap-
pened already. What extraordinary increase of
population and demand for new lands in the
United States may hereafter occur by emigration
from Europe, compared with former years, must
depend on so many contingencies both here and
there, such as good or bad governments, pros-
perity or decline of manufactures, and a tasto for
emigration to new lands in other quarters of the
world, as at present to prevent any person from
making a safe estimate.
Difficulties in Estimates as to Customs and Lands.
Comparative and speculative views, connected
with thenubjpct of our receipts from customs and
lands, could be further extended, but their prac-
tical utility might be deemed problematical, as
sufficient is believed to have been already stated
for all general purposes. Greater confidence is
felt in the estimate submitted for the receipts
from customs in 1836; as that offered last year
for 1835« founded on somewhat similar data, ha«i
not varied from the ascertained and estimated
actual receipts over n million of dollars; but the
actual receipts from lands have, for the various
reasons before explained, differed largely, and,
united with the failure to pass some usual and
anticipated appropriations at the last session of
Congress, have caused most of the increased sur-
plus now in the Treasury. The difficulty in at-
taining much certainty in estimating the receipts
from either customs or lands in any particular
year in a country so new, enterprising and pros-
perous as ours, has ever been considerable, in
addition to the fluctuations we always shall be
liable to from short crops, pestilence and war.
But this difficulty will be more strikingly exem-
plified till 1842, under the material alteration from
credit to cash payments, and under the continued
biennial changes to which the tariff is now sub-
jected. It was shown in 1822, in a report of a
Committee of the House of Representatives, that
from 1802 to that time, the estimates of our whole
receipts differed, either by excesses or deficien-
cies, from the actual receipts in different years,
from one to forty-three per cent; and in custom 
alone, from three to seventy-three; being an av-
erage of about sixteen per cent, per annum. The
difference since 1822 has been carefully examined,
and is found to vary from less than one per cent, to
over forty-one, and averages annually about thir-
teen per eent.    But the effects of the irregulanty
