SAVANNAH, April 6, 1862.

General D. C. BUELL:

Heavy firing is heard up the river, indicating plainly that an attack has been made upon our most advanced positions. I have been looking for this, but did not believe the attack could be made before Monday or Tuesday.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.
