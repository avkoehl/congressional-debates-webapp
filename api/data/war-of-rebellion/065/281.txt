force to oppose your landing. I have sent instructions to Colonel Guss, commanding at Fernandina, to have the railroad tracks on both roads beyond Baldwin torn up in several places after the train comes in to Jacksonville to-morrow, and to keep the tracks obstructed throughout Saturday night. The object of a prompt advance on Baldwin and, if possible, beyond, is to get possession of a train if one has been brought in by the enemy. The enemy are known to have a small force of infantry and a battery between Jacksonville and Baldwin.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I have assigned you a number of signal officers with organized parties.

BALDWIN, FLA., February 9, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

SIR: I have the honor to report that a portion of my command, under Brigadier General T. Seymour, convoyed by the gun-boat Norwich, Captain Meriam, ascended the Saint John's River on the 7th instant, and landed at Jacksonville on the afternoon of that day.

The advance, under Colonel Guy V. Henry, comprising the Fortieth Massachusetts Infantry, the Independent Battalion Massachusetts Cavalry, under Major Stevens, and Elder's horse battery (B, First Artillery), pushed forward into the interior on the night of the 8th; passed by the enemy, drawn up in line of battle at Camp Finegan, 7 miles from Jacksonville; surprised and captured a battery, 3 miles in rear of the camp, about midnight, and reached this place about sunrise this morning.

At our approach the enemy abandoned and sunk the steamer Saint Mary's and burned 270 bales of cotton a few miles above Jacksonville. We have taken, without loss of a man, over 100 prisoners, 8 pieces of excellent field artillery, in serviceable condition and well supplied with ammunition, and other valuable property to a large amount.

I shall have a train of cars running on the road from Jacksonville in three or four days.

The command will advance to-morrow morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
