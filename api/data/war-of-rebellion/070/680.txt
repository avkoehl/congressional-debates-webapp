sume, to get ready for further work as soon as possible. It is difficult to procure horses. The demands of other armies will cause ours to be neglected. The assemblage of so many fragments of regiments is in many respects objectionable for both the mounted and dismounted portions. I, therefore, think it will be well to mount the best regiments entirely, dismounting the least effective for the purpose, and organizing the cavalry of the department into one division instead of two. The dismounted regiments can replace infantry at home stations, as the 100-days' men will soon leave, and be mounted as fast as practicable under the charge of some officer who is qualified for organization. This is the best plan I can at present suggest. There are some details, of course, with which it is not necessary to trouble you. In any case, we must have some ten days' rest, with plenty of forage.

Major MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

For the past two days many reports have reached me from the Valley to the effect that General Hunter has been defeated. Is there any truth in the report?

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.

MARTINSBURG, June 27, 1864.

General WEBER:

General Hunter's defeat is not known. He did not succeed in taking Lynchburg, upon which he retired toward Lewisburg.

Major HUNTER,

Beverly:

Have you anything late from General Hunter's command? How many of your command are mounted? How many cavalry horses do you want to mount your command? How many does Captain Hagans want at Buckhannon?
