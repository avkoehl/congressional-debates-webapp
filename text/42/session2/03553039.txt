iment save the stubborn persistence of selfish
ironmongers and other manufacturers.
I have often urged here, as I have urged
from Maine to New York, in another forum,
that if this Government will not relieve us so that
' we may build ships, why not repeal the regis-
try law and let us buy abroad ; nay, let us buy
and place them under our flag, even if we
have to pay a tariff on the ship per ton 1 All
other nations may go to the Clyde and buy.
We alone are prohibited. It is a burning, blis-
tering reproach.
Oh! but we do not want to help Great Brit-
ain ! Well, Great Britain helps herself by our
ignorance or stubbornness. While we have
been losing our wealth by our tariffs since
1861, she has increased one hundred and
twenty-five per cent, or more. But Great
Britain and British labor is hostile to our
interests. Well, this Administration, in our
pusillanimous recreancy to the solemn treaty
for the adjustment of damages, does not seem
so very unfriendly to that ubiquitous and
commercial Power. We can trade free be-
tween our own States; we have no registry
of the ships of South Carolina or Louisiana,
Maine or New York ; yet, by our spite or
spirit, we have been slow to give cordiality
between North and South. Indeed, we have
fomented all discontents by bad rule and re-
prisals of men and property years after civil
strife ; and yet, and yet we allow trade to
be free between the States by land and sea,
while toward our loving British cousins we are
ready to bow our necks at Geneva but not at

RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO IKON.
I would therefore earnestly urge the follow-
ing change in the bill on bar iron. It reads, " bar
iron, rolled or hammered, not less than three
eighths or more than two inches thick ; not less
than one or more than six inches wide, and
rounds and squares not. iess than three quarters
ormore than two inches, shall pay three fourths
of a cent per pound;" atid ''bars not less than
oue quarter inch thick or more than one to
six inches wide, and round and square less
than three-quarter inch or more than two iuche3
shall pay one cent per pound." Under the
present differential duty none of these sizes
have been imported for years, the duty abso-
lutely prohibiting it. If amended so as to in-
clude the sizes sold at one uniform sterling
price in England, say '"not less than one half
or more than rhree inches, round and square,
and flats not less than one quarter or more than
two inches thick, nor less than one inch wide
or more than six inches wide," it would es-
tablish a uniform classification, lead to in-
creased duties, lessen the cost to consumers,
and remove the demand from American mill
owners, who since 1865 have had absolute con-
trol of that branch of trade.
The one-half and five eighth round and
square sizes have special uses in hardware
manufactures; while two and a quarter to three
round and square bars are largely used in
line-shafting m woolen, cotton-yarn, and other
mills, and the extra cost in equipping indus-
trial enterprises compels a higher cost of pro-
duction. The ill effect of these and similar
burdens is to give artificial vitality to industiy.
It not only affects commerce, but it increases
the cost of a railroad. It compels a high
freight rate to reimburse for the outlay. It
lessens the value of the farmer's crops. It
adds to the cost of all implements, the hoe,
the plow, the loom, and the anvii. It bur-
dens labor only, labor which is too often blind
to the fact that increased wages is due to
increased cost of living with no commensurate
benefit from the increase. Like the blind Sam-
son, it pulls down in its reckless strength the
very pillars of our prosperity, and it will have
the same end, to crush the lite out of itself I
EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE.
Admitting, as perforce one must, that tariffs
will still continue for a time to harass and im-
poverish the people, and coming to the question
of their adjustment according to the princi-
ple of cy pres, i. e., to get as near right as
possible, we must consider how much money
our Government ought to raise for its frugal
administration. No discussion of this or any
other bill affecting the revenues of the country
can be comprehensive unless at the same time
regard is had for the budget as a whole. We
must know what the expenditures are to be,
before we can wisely and judiciously proceed
to impose revenues.
Before proceeding to express my views as
to what the expenditures of the Government
should be limited to, let us consider the esti-
mates of the Administration:

These are the Administration estimates on
paper as published in the official documents.
What they are in reality may be judged by
the fact that included in these estimates is
$28,500,000for reductionof the national debt,
while the avowed intent and object of the Ad-
ministration is to expend $100,000,000 per
annum for this purpose. Including the $28,-
500,000 alluded to, the official estimates are
far below what the actual expenditure is found
to be. Excluding the expenditure for reduc-
tion of debt, and they are perhaps not very far
at fault. But whatdo they reveal, taken at the
figures furnished by the Administration? That
in 1873, eight years after the close of the war,
this Government is to cost the people $273,-
000,000, or nearly five times as much per an-
num as it did before the war, when the net
ordinary expenditures were but $60,000,000 !
Even after interest on the public debt is
deducted from the budget at both periods the
figuies of 1873 aie three times as great as
those of 1860, Our legislative expenses
should be no greater now thau then; our judi-
ciary should cost no more; our executive
ought not to be more expensive ; our Army is
no greater, or at least should not be greater.
As for our Navy we have none at, all to speak
of; and no foreign commerce, alas! for it lo
protecl. The Indians should cost less, for
they are dying out. Our post-otlice system is
but very little further extended now thau
then. Our customs service is no more extended
as to porls and districts; and although under
existing protective classifications and protect-
ive infinities of detail, and protective bewil-
derments of incomprehensible and tortuous
regulations, the service is difficult to perform,
it should not cost the immense enhancement
shown in the estimates.
The $2,000,000 appropriated for currency
printing is wholly unnecessary; the $19,500,000
devoted to public works—often but another
name, for public jobbery—is an insult to a
people staggering under the burdens now im-
posed upon them and clamoring for reform.
The miscellaneous expenses, over eleven mil-
lions, amount^ to as much as it used to cost
to run the entire Government within a period
when some of those now present were in public
life. _ Except interest on the public debt and
pensions, there is not an item in the Adminis-
tration estimates which is not susceptible of
material reduction. Even the interest is over-
stated fully $10,000,000, if the Administration
succeeds in cajoling this House into neglecting
to materially reduce the reveflues from customs
and internal taxes.
HOW MUCH IS IT NECESSARY TO EXPEND?
I think I am exceedingly fair, and largely
within the mark, when I claim that the ex-
penditures for 1872-73 can be reduced, without
inconvenience, to $200,000,000, including in-
terest on the public debt, and the one per
cent, sinking fund provided for by law, as the
annual rate or amount at which the principal
should be reduced. Indeed, I shall be pre-
pared to show at a proper time that the ex-
penditures could be reduced to $175,000,000;
but I am willing to treat the subject fairly, and
I claim that $200,000,000 is enough and
plenty, and with the improved confidence in
the Government which such a reduction would
occasion, the debt could be funded without the
aid of juggling syndicates at a lower rate of
interest, which now it cannot be. With eco-
nomical management $200,000,000 for 1878
would pay all expenses, put $25,000,000 in
the sinking fund, and leave a substantial sur-
plus at the end of the year.
THE PRESENT TAX SYSTEM.
Having now considered how much we need
to expend, let us next consider how we shall
obtain the money. The existing revenue sys-
tem yielded as follows during the year ended
June 30, 1871 :
Customs $206,270,408
Internal revenue  143,098,154
Public lands  2,388,640
Miscellaneous  31,566,737
Total $383,323,9-15
In addition to this, some eight or nine mil-
lions were derived from the sale of ordnance,
stores, &c., which T leave out of view.
For the current fiscal year ending on 30th
June next, the Treasury estimates the revenues
at $365,000,000. This is an under-estimate.
For the succeeding year ending June 30, 1873,
the Treasury estimates the revenue at $359,-
000,000. This is a still more flagrant under-
estimate. Recollect that these estimates are
necessarily based on the assumption that there
will be no change in the revenue laws. Recol-
lect also that this is a growing country, and
that the revenues have steadily increased from
year to year in the past, and without change in
the laws are bound to do so in the future, and
gentlemen will be able to measure the ingenu-
ousness of this Administration simply from an
exhibit of its comparative estimates of reve-
nues.
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES OF NET REVENUES.
1870-71 (actual)   $383,323,945
1871-72 (estimated)  365,000,000
1872-73 (estimated)  359,000,000
Instead of adding some ten or twenty mil-
lions a year to the revenues, as past experi-
ence proves that it should, it actually takes
that amount off! So that instead of $400,-
000,000, the sum we shall unquestionably
obtain in 1873 if the present laws are undis-
turbed, the Administration figures the revenues
for that year down to $359,000,000; and sim-
ply for the purpose of having plenty of money
to expend, and plenty of profits to distribute
among its followers I
A BUDGET.
I believe these views are susceptible of being
reduced to such exact demonstration as to com-
mand universal, if, indeed, unwilling assent.
If accepted as sound we shall have to cut down
all the existing rates of customs duties and
internal revenues fully one half, iu order to
