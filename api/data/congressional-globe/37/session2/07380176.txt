Confiscation of Rebel Property—Mr. Sargent.
Ho. or Reps.
oftencrdisplayed iheolivc branch than the sword.
We have proffered peace without penalty by
every means by which we could get access to the
southern ear. By pi evidential messages, by cor-
respondence with foreign nations published to
the world, by resolutions and declarations of
Congress, by the public press, wo have vainly
offered to them immunity in their constitutional
rights, and endeavored to induco tliom to resume
their place and power in the Union. We have
tenderly nursed their sick and wounded, we have
extorted their acknowledgment of the excellent
conduct of our troops in their conquered cities,
we have not laid hand upon even their peculiar
institution in the regions traversed by our aimies.
Whou southern property has been committed to
the flames it has been by southern hands; when
a party of helpless women and children was fired
upon for expressions of delight upon the display
of a flag at New Orleans, it was by southern sol-
diers. We have even srr guards over the property
of secessionists who weie at the time m open re-
bellion, to prevent its spoliation. Never was a
war so humanely conducted before as it has been
by this Adnnnistiation,never was foibeaiance so
long, never mercy so gieat.
I ask, gentlemen, what has been the fruit of tins
policy? Have we witnessed any cessation of the
efforts of the rebels? Have we succeeded in bring-
ing them to a more Christian frame of mind ? Aie
they nor to-day as fiercely hostile as ever? jWiy,
sir, has notour policy been injurious to our cause?
Will it be denied that it is to-day safer to ho a
rebel m any one of the seceded States than to he
a (JnioniNt, whatever the result of the war as it js
at piesent conducted? With ruthless and un-
sparing hand the. c.onf< derate government confis-
cates ordestroysthepropertyofUnion men, while
the reb"l has no reason to lent" by any action we
have yet taken that he will be injured m person
or property ii the rebellion is put down. Thus,
by our hesitation to pass a bill of tins character,
we allow a state of things to continue which ne-
cessarily gives to the rebellion all that stimulus
which apt mgs from a love of property and personal
safety
To those gentlemen who fear that a vote uf Con-
gresa may tend to exasperate the rebels, 1 com-
mend the report recently made by the joint com-
mittee upon the conduct of the war, iii regard to
the barbarities commuted by those rebels at the
\ ei y commencement oi the war. This committee,
in obedience to n resolution of the Senate, have
collected evidence concerning the treatment by the
rebels at Manassas of the remains of ollicers and
soldiers of the United Suites? killed m battle there,
ami in die piogros of their investigations have
dov< loped hicts showing a barbuiism and cruelly
towards wounded and other prisoners that evince
in tlie strongest light the great necessity of refrain-
ing from any act on our part that will tend to ex-
asperate rebels ! How great a misfortune it would
be if by a confiscation or any other law we should
dimmish the love these traitors have for us! Here
is the manner m which these mild-mannered, not-
to-be-esasperuUid rebels, followed up the first con-
si.ieuiole battle, us shown by the report to which

sawed off the bone without leaving any of the flesh to form
the flaps to cover It; and with all the ioice they could use
they couid not £ct flap enough to cover the bone. They
were then obliged tos-awoffaboet an inch moieof the bone,
and even then, when they came to put in the sutures, (the
stitches,) they eouid not appioxnnato the edyes within less
than an inch and a halt of each othei; of course, as soon
as there was any swelling, the s>utuhes tore oj>tand the bone
stuck through again. Dr. Swahn tried afterwards to rem-
edy it by pei forming another operation, but Prescott had
become so debilitated that he did not survive.* Corporal
Preseott was a young man of high position, and had received
a very liberal education.
"The same witness describes the sufferings of the wound-
ed after the battle as inconceivably horrible; with bad food,
no covering, no watei. They were lying upon the tlooras
thickly as they could be laid. {There was not a particle
of light in the house to enable us to move among tliem.'
Deaf to all hi* appeals, they continued to lefuse water to
these suffenng men, and he was oniv enabled to procure it
by setting cups undei the eaves to catcli the i.nn that was
falling, and in this way he ^pent the night catching the
water and conveying Jt to the wounded to dunk. As there
w.is no lieht, he was obliged to crawl on his hands and
knees to avoid stepping on their wounded limbs; and, he
add-', 1 it is not a wonder that next moinnig we found that
seveial had died dining the night.' The young surgeons,
who seemed to delight in hacking arid butchering these
biave del'endeis of our countiy's flag, were not, it would
senn, petnutted to petfotm <ui} opeiations upon the lebel
wounded. 'Some of oiu wounded,J  ays this witness
' were left I\ mg upon the battle-field until Tuesday night
and Wednesday morning. When brought in, their wounds
were completely alive with laivas deposited there bv the
flies, having laid out through all the iam stoun of Mo'ndav
and the hot, suluy sunshine of Tuesday.5 The dead lai'd
upon the field unbuiied for live d.iy?; and this included
men not only ot bi<o\vn.the fourteenth legmient, but of
other legiments. Tins witrie^ testifies thauhe iebeid'jad

_ Horrible as is this picturc, much of its j-opul- I
siveness may be shaded away b^the supposition ■
that the lmrry and tumult following a battle may I
have prevented adequate attention to our wounded,
although many circumstances cannot thus be ex-
cused ; while our practice has ever been, as is that
of all civilized nations, to make no disci imination
between friend and foe in dealing with the wounded
or sick. Hut what excuse can he offered foi such
atrocities as the following-, out of many recorded
in the report?
" The ca>e of Dr. I-Vrguson, of one of the New York regi-
ments. is mentioned by Dr. Swahn. ' When gettni" into
hi? ambulance to look after his own wounded he was fned
upon by the rebel*. When he told them who he wc^, they
said they would take a paitmg <hor nr bun. which thev/hJ
wounding hnu in the leg. lie had in* hoot> on, and ln^ mriis
on hi* boor*,and us ih<-y diove alone hi**pui- would'-an h
in the tail boatd of the ambulance, causing him to -hnek
with agony.' An officcr rode up, nnd, pjaci ij Ju"-
Ju  head, tlneau-ned to shoot him if he continued losciuim.
Tin* wax on Sunda}', the day of the battle.5'
When it is considered that Dr. Ferguson was
a non-belligerent, that he was in discharge of pio-
fessional and humane duties when he was wan-
tonly shot, the temper of the rebels needs little
other commentary. That this was not a solitary
case, but that our soldiers, while defenseless and
m prison, were shot in cold blood, is shown by
the testimony of the gallant General Ricketts. He
was himFoif taken prisoner and confined in Rich-
mond, and testified that a number ol our men weie
shot by the seiitnes:
" fn one instance two were shot; one w.v« killed, ynd tiie
a wS,;,"lif,l,y:in,ar w,nu "" «■  •<"
uow Mil wiule lie capped it."
1 ho bayoneting of prisoners seems to have been '
a favorite amusement. General Ricketts said, be-
fore the committee:
" I heard of a cieat many of our niisnners who had boon
ba> oneted and shot. I ,aw three of ,hem-n™ that ind

Louis Francis, himse.lf, testified before the com-
mittee. He bore the marks on his person of ter-
rible wounds and maltreatment, and had losta le^.
He was a private in the New York fourteenth regi-
ment. He says:
"I was attacked by two lebel sohlieis, and wounded in
the right knee with the bayonet. As I lay on the sod they
kept bayoneting mc until I received fourteen wounds."
In all ages respect for the dead has been held to
be a necessary virtue in a brave and generous char-
acter. To inflict outrage upon a slain enemy, even,
has heretofore been confined to dark corners of
the earth. Such practices are too vile and mean
to be tolerated in the lightof civilization. Hence
the fiendish spirit of the rebel leaders is painfully
apparent in their tieatment of our heroic dead.
They were stripped naked, and left for days un-
buried. Many were buried in trenches, face
downward, as a mark of indignity, Some were
boiled to get the bones for trophies, and heads cut
off that the skulls might be kept for drinking cups.
Many human bones were found scattered through
the rebel huts, sawed into rings. The report
says:
"Daniel BL\by. ]i*., of Wir-lun?ton, testifies that he went
out in company with Mi. G. A. Smait. of Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, who went to r-eaiehior the body ot hi- biother,
who fell at ftlackhuin-'s Fold in the action of the 18th of
July. They found tiie gia\e. The clothe^ weie identified
as those of his hrothei on account ot some pecuhaiity in
the make, for they had been made by his mother; and, in or-
dei to identify them, other clothes made by her w eie taken,
that they might compare them. 1 We found no head m the
grave, and no hones of any kind—nothimr but the eiotlK*s
and poitions ot the flesh. "\\re found the'iemanis of three
other bodies all together. The clothes were tneie; some
fle.-h was felt, but no bones.
The statement of residents near the place, white
and black,was. that the rebels had boiled poitions
of the bodies oi our dead to obtain their bones as
relics.
Governor Sprague appeared before the commit-
tee, and gave evidence of matters coming under
his own observation. I read from the report:
"The evidence of that distinguished and patriotic citi-
zen, Hon. William fcpi.igue. Governor of tfou s>tateoJ Khode

baitie-tield was to recover the bodies ot Colonel Slocum
and Muior Daliou, ot the Jlhode 1-land regiment. He took

On leaching the place he states that{we commenced dig-
ging lor the bodies of Colonel Sloeum and Majoi Ballouat
the fepot pointed out to us by these men who 'had been m
the action. While diggmsr, some neuro women came up
and asked whom we were lookingfoi, and at ihesame tune
said that C'oionel Slocuin had been dug up bv the rebels,
hy vomp men of aGeoi<.aa regiment, his, head'eat off, and
Ins bod\ tal.i n to a ravine tlmty or forty vaids below, and
tlieie burned. We stopped diir^mg and went to the spot
de-ignatt.d, where we lound coals and a>ht-> and buuea
mingled together. A little distance fiuin tboie we found a
shirt (-till buttoned .it the neck) and blanket uith hu«*,*
quantities or han upon it, everything indicating the burn-
ing of a body thwe. We returned and dug down'at the spot

there; but at the place pointed out as thegiave where Col-
onel Sloeum w,u  buried we found a box, which, upon hew*
laired and opened, was found to contain the bodv of Col-
onel Sloeum. The soldiers who had buned the two bodie*
