The general commanding directs that you send out parties to collect stragglers and dispatch them to their different commands. General Porter reports that stragglers line the roads. General Heintzelman is at fort Lyon, General Franklin at Seminary, General Porter at Mary Hall's house, Reynolds near Fort Albany, couch en route from Tennallytown on river road up the Potomac, McDowell near Ball's Cross-Roads. Banks at Rockville, Sumner en route for Rockville, Sigel near Fort Ethan Allen, Sturgis at Ball's Cross-Roads. You will also direct your patrols to check all driving of teams faster than a walk, and arrest every one who refuses to obey the order. Acknowledge receipt of this.

HARPER'S FERRY, September 5, 1862.

Major-General WOOL,

Baltimore:

Captain Cole, just returned from Piont of Rocks, says all the reports from there in regard to the enemy are false; none but cavalry has passed over the Potomac; that the canal has been cut at Noland's Ferry. Voss' cavalry yesterday toward Winchester had a brush with about fifty of the enemy's cavalry. Killed one and took a horse. We want our commissary requisitions filled. Please start the trains; I don't believe there is any danger.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.
