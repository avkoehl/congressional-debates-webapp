I forward the individual reports, so that the commanding officer may know to what extent each command participated in the events of the day. It cannot be expected that I should mention all the brave exploits of persons or even regiments, particularly on an occasion when all did so well. Our lines were very much extended, and I frequently necessarily found myself separated from each regiment; but on no occasion did I see a single regiment misbehave. All seemed to act with a coolness and determination that surprised even ourlves after the excitement of the action was ever.

On the afternoon of the 4th instant Brigadier-General Williams ordered me forward, with my own regiment and three pieces of light artillery, belonging to the Twenty-first Indiana Regiment, under First Lieutenant Brown, to a point about 2 miles from the river, for the purpose of supporting the Sixth Michigan Regiment Volunteers. After making a careful reconnaissance of the grounds, accompanied by Captain Clarke, acting lieutenant-colonel, in front and on the right flank, I posted one piece on the Greenwell Springs road, the second on the road leading to Torkins' plantation, and the third at the head of Boulevard street, the first two supported by the Sixth Michigan, and the latter by the Thirtieth Massachusetts Volunteers, then under the command of Major H. O. Whittemore, its left resting on the flank of Nims' battery, which was posted in the woods to the left of Boulevard street. Our pickets reported nothing during the night to warrant the belief that we should be attacked in the morning.

At 3.30 o'clock the enemy sounded the assembly, which we took at first to be the long roll. On finding it to be only the assembly I ordered it repeated, supposing it to have been sounded by our regiments on the left, which promptly called all our troops on the right to their feet. Reveille roll call was hardly over when firing commenced simultaneously on the left and center of our front, shortly followed by the discharge of artillery on the extreme right. The latter was most promptly responded to by Lieutenant Brown with his two pieces and with great effect, as the scores of dead rebels that laid thickly strewn in his front after the battles gave evidence.

The engagement on the whole line now became general. I immediately ordered Nims' battery, under the command of its brave and excellent first lieutenant, Trull, to the left and considerably to the front, so as to clear the thick woods in its front, supported by the Thirtieth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers. This battery went into action within 250 yards of a Kentucky regiment, sheltered by a fence and corn field, where it remained, doing excellent service, until ordered to change position. Officers and men could not behave better. More coolness could not be expected from old veterans than the officers and men of this battery displayed. They changed position four times under my own observation, and on each occasion its gallant commander displayed his perfect competency for the prominent part he acted in this severest part of this well-contested field.

At this period of the action the fire on Mannin's battery and the In-
