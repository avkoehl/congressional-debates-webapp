Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I am connecting with the battery of Second Corps and am establishing picket-line. I will it complete. As I am now sharply engaged in trying to save the guns captured I may have to shorten my line. I have sent two officers to report progress.

Yours, truly,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-5.40 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Your are mistaken in supposing that the enemy are withdrawing from my front. They are in force on my whole front, and with a heavy artillery five. They are plainly to be seen. I have ordered General Terry to advance his skirmishers at once, and connect closely with the Second Corps picket-line.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
