MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

Fort Gaines, Ala., March 21, 1865.

Colonel S. B. HOLABIRD,

Chief Quartermaster, Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, La.:

COLONEL: New Orleans must be considered for the present the main depot from which our supplies must be drawn for the troops operating in South Alabama and West Florida, and the major-general commanding the Military Division and Army of West Mississippi directs that your stock of forage, quartermaster's stores, and clothing, camp and garrison equipage be kept up and renewed, so far as is in your power, by timely requisitions and estimates, having in contemplation the furnishing of the army now operating in South Alabama and West Florida. The wants of the quartermaster's department in this army will be made known to you as frequently and fully as is practicable or possible. It is believed that if your estimates already forwarded North and hereafter made by you are filled promptly, there will be no impediment in the way of supplying this army and the troops at present within the Department of the Gulf proper. The following is approximately, in round numbers, the number of men and animals now with and that will be with the army operating in South Alabama and West Florida to be supplied: Forty thousand infantry, 8,000 cavalry, 2,500 artillery, 1,000 engineers, 11,500 horses, and 12,500 mules. When the information was first received at headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi that the force under General A. J. Smith was to be sent to this army from General George H. Thomas' army, I informed you of the number of animals expected to arrive with that force, and directed estimates for forage to be made accordingly, in addition to the necessary estimates for the animals then dependent for their supply on the depot in New Orleans. These estimates were forwarded, I think, at once through my office, and are doubtless being filled. Shortly before leaving New Orleans for this point, I was informed by you that the forage officer in New Orleans was continuing to make the proper estimates.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. G. SAWTELLE,

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief Quartermaster, Mil. Div. of West Miss.

General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to return herewith, inclosed, the letter from Major-General Hurlbut to Colonel Christensen, and which was referred to me to-day by the major-general commanding. I believe that the fears expressed therein by General Hurlbut are groundless, so far as regards the main supplies for this army, provided the estimates and requisitions already made and those ordered to be made are promptly met at the North. I inclose herewith a copy of a letter* this day addressed by me (through the commanding general Department of
