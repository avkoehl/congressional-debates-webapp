Major General JOHN A. DIX., Commanding, Fort Monroe, Va.

GENERAL: I am required to furnish to the War Department a list of all prisoners of war taken by the Army of the Potomac, giving the State, rank, regiment, and company, the place where captured, when captured and the place where confined. Will you have the kindness to direct that lists corresponding to the above instructions of all prisoners within the range of your command be made out and forwarded to me with as little delay as practicable? I have the honor to inclose General Orders, Nos. 32* and 67*, from the War Department, which you may not have seen. I will forward to the assistant adjutant-general at Fort Monroe blanks for monthly returns of prisoners and blank rolls which I respectfully request may be distributed to those places where prisoners of war are held.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a report made to me by Colonel J. H. Tucker commanding Camp Douglas in relation to the records of prisoners and the condition of funds belonging to prisoners at Camp Douglas. By this report it appears that of the moneys received by Colonel Mulligan for prisoners of war there is a deficiency of $1,450. 75. There are no papers of any kind left at the post by Colonel Mulligan to show what became of this money and I respectfully ask for instructions how to proceed in this matter. Can the money of which the prisoners have been defrauded be refunded to them in any way?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
