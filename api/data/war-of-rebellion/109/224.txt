ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, Numbers 9. Pittsburg, Tenn., March 16, 1862.

The four brigades of this division will march from Pittsburg on the Corinth road, armedand equipped for a two days' march, in the following order: The First Brigade will move at midnight to-night, the Second Brigade at 1 a. M., the Third at 4 a. M., and the Fourth at daylight. The head of the column will have a guide and will move by way of Bethel, the Bark road, Jack Chambers' farm, and take position at some point about ten miles out, to cover, reconnaissance of cavalry. The column will move slow and deliberately, with advance guard and flankers, and in case of attack each brigade or regiment will send word to the rear and defend their ground. Commanders of brigades will at once report to the commanding general and receive full instructions. He will, after seeing the brigades fairly started, join the advance. The commanding general again cautions the commanders of brigades, regiments, and companies to keep in good, close order, to prevent even marching by side-paths, but to keep in ranks as on parades. Frequent rests by brigades should be ordered-the progress about two miles per hour. Troops marching thus make a better impression than when they straggle on the road. Guides will be provided as far as possible, but commanders of brigades may impress citizens as guides, to be treated kindly but firmly.

By order of Brigadier General W. T. Sherman:

J. H. HAMMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
