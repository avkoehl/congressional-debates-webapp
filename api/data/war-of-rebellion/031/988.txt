GENERAL: There are now at Harper's Ferry, on the Virginia side of the Potomac, twelve companies of the Sixth New York Artillery Regiment, the Sixth Maryland Regiment, the Fifth Maryland Regiment, the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Cole's squadron of Maryland Cavalry, Potomac Home Brigade, and two batteries of six 3-inch rifle guns each. No more troops should be sent there, in my judgment, by reason of insecurity of the bridges which cross the river. The railroad bridge is impassable for infantry, and, of course, for wagons. The pontoon bridge, although now passable, is liable at any time to mishaps, and in case there should be a considerable rise in the river both bridges will go-certainly, if there be floating be floating ice in any quantity. The railroad bridge should at once be made substantial, and of sufficient capacity to permit the passage of wagons; if this be done it will dispense with the necessity of the pontoon bridge, and enable the Government to transport and lay the bridge across the river at Williamsport, where it is needed to convey troops to Martinsburg and Winchester [reaching Hagerstown by the Cumberland Valley Railroad, or by the way of Frederick], and to afford the garrison of those and adjacent places a safe and convenient crossing into Maryland.
