Major LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy all said they would give battle at Rome. Some deserters have been taken by me, and say many are in the mountains that will come in. About 600 cavalry left this morning, but my parties could not overtake them, as they had fresh horses and ours were jaded-I was detained by General Wood a little, or I think I could have made a dash
