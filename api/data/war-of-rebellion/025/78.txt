HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, July 7, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I inclose herewith a copy of a report of Brigadier-General McPherson, superintendent of railroads, from which it will be seen that we opened 367 miles of road in less than one month, besides repairing a number of locomotives and cars which were captured from the enemy greatly injured. Indeed the wood work of most of the cars has been entirely rebuilt, and all this work has been done by details from the army. The men have worked with most commendable industry and energy, and have shown the greatest willingness and alacrity in thus securing the territory we have gained from the enemy. Without these roads our position here would have been untenable for the want of supplies.

We are still greatly in want of rolling stock, but Assistant Secretary Tucker has assured me that he will immediately give his attention to supplying this deficiency. I have made requisition on the Quartermaster-General for the purchase of the Rogers locomotives.

Brigadier-General McPherson deserves great credit for the energy and untiring industry which he has devoted to the repair and organization of these roads.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE,

Corinth, Miss., June 29, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Commanding Department of the Mississippi:

SIR: We have the following lines of railroad now open, and in running order, viz:

Miles.

From Corinth to Columbus............................. 143 1/2

From Corinth to Decatur.............................. 95

From Corinth to Booneville........................... 20 1/2

From Corinth to Chewalla............................. 12

From Memphis to Grand Junction....................... 49

From Grand Junction to Jackson....................... 47

---------

Total................................................ 367

To operate these roads successfully and do the business required for the army we will need 15 locomotives, besides those already on hand, most of which are old and very much out of repair. I understand that 25 locomotives were ordered for the Mobile and Ohio Railroad (5-feet gauge) from the Paterson Locomotive and Machine Works, Paterson, N. J., and that more than half of them were completed or nearly so, but were never delivered in consequence of the breaking out of the rebellion. These locomitives could most likely be procured and placed upon the road in a short time.

We will also need, in addition to what we now have on hand, 6 first-class passenger cars, 16 second-class passengers cars, 8 mail and express baggage cars, and 100 box freight cars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Brigadier-General and Superintendent.
