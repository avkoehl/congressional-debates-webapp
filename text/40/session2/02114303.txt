Munapers on the part of the Senate.
BENJAMIN F. BUTLER,
W. WISDOM,
Managers on the part of the House*
Mr. BROOKS. I would like to hear some
explanation of this report from the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butler.]
Mr. BUTLJEli, of Massachusetts. Mr.
Speaker, there are but one or two matters to
which I think it will be necessary to call the
attention of the House. The bill as it went
from the House was amended iu the Senate
by inserting quite a number of provisions
making appropriations to carry out, as was
supposed, existing treaties. In every case
where the ordinary appropriations to carry out
existing treaties were found to be required by
positive law the House agreed to the Senate
amendments.
Mr. BROOKS. Will the gentleman be kind
enough to state what those treaties are ?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I say
that wherever the ordinary appropriations for
the payment of annuities to Indians, and for
meeting the ordinary expenses of the Indian
service under the custom of the Indian depart-
ment, were required by existing law, the
amendments of the Senate have been agreed
to. Wherever any discretion was left to
Congress, and where the House bill appro-
priated less money than was proposed to be
appropriated in the. Senate amendments or in
the estimates of the Interior
there as a rule, the Senate recedes, so
leave the bill with reference to these matters
very nearly as it left the House, except  cases
where there were evidently mistakes. Thus
