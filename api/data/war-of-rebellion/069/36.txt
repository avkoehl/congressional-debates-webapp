ED. W. SMITCH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 220, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff, Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

COLONEL: I find the enemy in strong forced, and am losing heavily. The left seems to be safe enough. A prisoners says their line runs from one river to he other, with rifle-pits, &amp;c.; and the number supposed to be there is about 20,000 men. I think if you wish the attack pushed, I should have more troops. General Terry has just informed me that the right of his picket-line is threatened by a mass of troops, said to be a brigade.

Very respectfully, yours,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.

You will send two brigades to the relief of General Gillmore.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Second indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,May 20, 1864-4.45 p. m.

I have one regiment not in line. Every regiment beyond that leaves a gap in my line. I shall give the orders to get ready, but shall not order to report till I get other notice.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

[Third indorsement.]

The enemy is very strong, I have no doubt, and General Gillmore appears to think that additional forces must be sent him, or he will have to draw off. I cannot decide here. The loss is heavy.

J. W. SHAFFER.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 20, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have my trenches now garrisoned by the minimum force to make them safe. One full brigade at least should be sent to me in order to drive the enemy from the rifle-pits they captured this morning. If it is sent at once to replace my troops in the entrenchments, I will take off the latter and recapture the position lost this morning.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
