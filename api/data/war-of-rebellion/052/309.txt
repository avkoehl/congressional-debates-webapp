Minty? I suppose they will be necessary to keep up the connection between Jasper and General Crittenden.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier General, Comdg. Third Div., Twenty-first Army Corps.

ORDERS HDQRS. THIRD DIV., 21ST ARMY CORPS,

In Camp, September 2, 1863.

I. The command will move to-morrow morning at 6 o'clock promptly, the First Brigade in advance. The usual order of march will be observed, the artillery, trains, &amp;c., moving as heretofore prescribed. Colonel Barnes will detail a regiment to act as rear guard.

By command of Brigadier General H. P. Van Cleve:

E. A. OTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, September 2, 1863.

General GARFIELD:

Telegraph line between here and Columbia in working order.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, September 2, 1863-12 p.m.

General GARFIELD:

The Third and Sixth Tennessee Infantry and Stoke's cavalry have arrived at McMinnville. The regiment at Fayetteville has arrived at Cowan. McCook will probably reach Huntsville to-morrow. The Twenty-eight Kentucky, from Clarksville, has reached Columbia. The Thirteenth Wisconsin has not yet reached that point. I am unable to relieve or evacuate Carthage, there being some 300 wagon-loads of supplies at that post.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, ALA., September 2, 1863.

Major General GORDON GRANGER, Nashville:

Colonel Shelley telegraphs his arrival at McMinnvile with Third and Sixth East Tennessee and Stokes' cavalry. The general commanding desires you to send a first-rate officer there to command the post; thinks you had better send Colonel Lowe with the Fifth Iowa Cavalry.

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

STEVENSON, ALA., September 2, 1863.

Major General G. GRANGER, Nashville:

The general commanding suggests that you can draw from Gallatin to strengthen Carthage. He also says hold everything well in hand to protect our communications until Burnside gets well down, so as to prevent the possibility of Forrest making a raid.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
