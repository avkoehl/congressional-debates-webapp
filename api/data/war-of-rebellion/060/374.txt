Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

General Sullivan's cavalry scouts report Early falling back up the Shenandoah Valley. He was believed to be near Woodstock on Saturday. All quiet in the western portion of my department. The snow in the mountains and excessive cold weather preclude any active operations on my part or the enemy's. The Kanawha River is frozen over. I go to-night to Washington to testify in the case of Colonel McReynolds before court-martial.
