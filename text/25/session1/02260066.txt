iheie weie some too recent not to be fie h m tie
minds.of all No one, lie be'ieved, had forgotten
the removal oí the deposites, m 1833, or ¡he crisis
and panic which followed, the deep agnation of
¡he public mi ad, the v íolent pari} excitement, the
failures aad bankruptcies, aad the general cry oí
nun, which le^oundecl from one end of the Union
to the other And what was that measure which
produced such frightful and a'armmge onsequences1
He did not speak of it in a political point of view
Sir, that measure, which brought on one of the
gieafest elites that this countiy has ever exrpenen
ed, which, in the opinion of some, threatened a
i evolution, and almost shook the Union to its cen-
tie, was nothing moie than changing the deposi'e
of sorne three or tour millions oí the public iunds
itom one set of banks to another set of banks, m the
same places The deposite act, oi the manner of its
execution, is considered as one of the prominent
causes oí existing embaí assmenfe And the Tita
sury circular has been, and is now, here and else-
where, regarded as among the cauc.es winch have
deranged the currency and prostiated the business
of the countij The large amount of revenue
which had accumulated m the deposite banks, all
admitted, was one oí the causes of existing difficul-
ties, lie was tned of these co nplamts, and he be-
lie /ed the people were tired of them If our mon-
etary affans are of so hellish a nature, and there
w as so much susceptibility in the commercial com-
munity, it was time that the financial affans ol the
Government were placed on a difleient footing, so
that they could not be charged with distuibmg
these mteiesls
But there was one more consideration, oi gitat
weight in his mind, m tavor of this great measure
of a separation of the Government fiom all bank-
ing institutions The banks hat e become an ele-
ment of political jiova, and the basi. ol a moneyed
austoctacv The whole system is one lestmg on
monopoly and exclusa e privileges, in derogation
of the equal and common light oi the people Ev-
penenee has also proved that the s\ stem is founded
on unsound principles,and its íapid and dangeious
extension, the last few years, and the serious evils
attending it, hive produced a ver} geneial comic
lion, embiacing, probably, a laige majonty of the
people, that the system canno' long he endined,
as it f>, that it must eithei be íefmmcd or abandon
ed From dear bought expenem e, tins had become
the geneial sentiment. But this reloim cannot be
effected heie, we have no juiisdiction ovei the
su'ijcil Congress did not cieate the State banks,
and it cannot unraake th in or reíoi m ihe system
This belongs to the peo j]c and the ts ate- k1 us
leave it there, thev have the powei and ait com-
petent to the task The accomplishment oí lias
importantm isure—ont which at this tane excites
a deeper and moie universal mteiest than ha-,cvei
before e\is ed m relation to any refoi m m our mil
institutions—-will no doubt be resisted violently
despeiateh by the whole combined moneyed nillu
ente of the euuntn The issue is alreadv made
up, it is a great issue, one which will be likely to
agitate the public mind foi twenty }eors tocóme
On the one side is the popular will, the great mass
of the people, on the other aie the banks and the
moneyed power On the one side (if he might use
the language of the London bankei S circular) is
the aristocracy of w ealth, on the othei, the democ
racy of numbeis The sti uggle will be aiduous,
and, probably, long, but the result cannotbe d mbt-
ful At a timp like this, and undei such cticum-
stances, is it pi opei lor this Government to become
a party to this contest1 As we cannot do it directly,
is ítpioper, is it right, for us lointeileremdirecdy1
As we cannot assist m can \ mg ou' this great i e-
form, all that he asked «as, that this Government
should stand aside It cannot nghtfully become a
party <.o this contest, it cannot promote the leform,
but i' may retaid it Shall Congi ess interpose if
self between the people and this great measure 1
Shall it take sides with the b^nks against the peo-
ple , Shall this Government become the endorser
tnd the bickei ot the State banks 1 Shall we by
oai imp'opei connexion with them, encourage
them to look to us to sustain themselves against the
popular voice i Shall we unite and league them
together, and thus add to their power by combina-
tion1 Sir, let this Government stand aloof f^om
this contest, and leave the banks m the hands of
the Spates and people from whom they derived then
existence, and to whom they are amenable for their
acts and by whose will they must stand or fall
Mr N sajd he h^d gone through with the sub-
ject, so lar a  regards the matteis moie particularly
connected with the bill undei consideiation, but
would briefly notice another topic, which had been
drawn into this debate
It is said, by gentlemen, that no measures are pro-
posed fbi the relief of the country , that we seem
only anxious to take care of the Government, and
to do nothing foi the people This is the bioad and
general objection to the measures leported by the
Committee of Finance Is this charge well found
ed1 He thougat it was not What is meant by
taking care of the Government, and doing nothing
for the people i Have the people no interest in the
Government' Is it not their Government i And
is not what is done foi the Government, done foi
the people1
But he supposed gentlemen meant that no mea-
sures were pioposed to relieve the present embar-
íassments of the countiy But is this coi reef Will
not most of the bills which hav e been reported by
the committee have a tendency to affoid relief1
The bill extending the time of payment of the mei-
chants' bonds is certainly a direct and impoitant
measure of relief, the bill giving indulgence to the
deposite banks which are indebted to the T> easurv
is ano her essential measure of lehef, and the bill
authorizing the issue of Treasury notes, although
intended to aid the Treasury, will opeiate mo«t
beneficially as a measure of relief to the whole
countiy I's immediate effect will be eqim alent to
the miiision of a sum into the metallic currency ef
the country equal to the notes to be issued
So far as the revenues of the Government aie
concerned, om measuies all tend to affoid relief
Ought w e to go fm ther 1 Can w e go further i What
do Senators dtsueor expect1 Do they wish the
Government to provide for liquidating the foreign
debtofoui mcichants1 or would the} have us as-
sist the banks1 Why tne Senator from Virginia
(Vtr Rr'es) says Uiat all that is wantin  is confi
deuce' Confidence from whom, and m whom 1 He
seems to suppose that the want of confidence in the
Slate hanks is the principal souice of difficulty,
and that the measuies proposed were calculated to
destiov, rathei than to i estore, that confidence But
Mi N appiehended that the want of confidence in
the banks was not the cause of our difliculties they
had lafhci pioceeded lrom an exce s of confidence
in the bank and he did not now think theievvas
any w ant of confidence in the solvency of the banks,
he was lathei astonished that there was so much
c mfidence
What vv er the pi t sent causes of the pi ostration of
business ' He did not mean the causes which may
have brought the country into this situation Is the
wtfrit of confidence the mam cause1 Hethoughtnot
The causes lie much deepei and broader Yon
mignt as vv ell suppose that a patient, brought by a
violent lev er to a low state could suddenly recov ei
by confidence Sir, something moie than confidence
is lequncd The causes now operating aie debt
and the de tángeme id oj the ennency, and mainly the
loimei The disordered state of the cuirencvis
extremely vexatious, and it embanastes the domes-
tie exchanges T. his is about the extent of its in-
fluence , for as long as the bills of the banks en cu-
late freely^ thev answer the general purposes of
euriency But debt is the great cause, all ovei-
tradmg produces exhaustion, the debts abioad and
at horns must be paid off, or gi eatly reduc ed befoie
business can revive This ¡eqmies time, and the
avaifs of the c ops of the countiv It is the true
policy of this Government to connect its legislation
as hule as possible with the gteat interests of the
counti} and the business concerns of the people
Pi o'ection,freedom, and security m then puisuits,
are all the Government can afford, and all a wise
people will desire
But it is claimed that it is thedinvof Congies, to
adopt measuies to bring fbout a resumption ol spe-
cie payments by the banks How can Congress do
this1 Whatpovvei ha ye we over the State banks'!
Can we, by coertion, con pel them to resume pay.
ments1 This is no' claimed but it is supposed w e
can effect the object by means of our revenue But
(Mr ]>T said) be had no fai'h n suchiemcdies we
have been Hying them for years, tO what have
they amounted to ' We have tried aie experiment
of d national bank, and that of deposite banks, for
regulating the papci cm rent > of the Slate banks,
and he held that both experiments had failed It
had not been regulated or improved, but had gone
on from bad to worse du ring the whole of this period.
He thought ¿t im ise and mischievous for Con-
gress to deceive iiself and delude the country any
longer Sir, \t is high lime thjS delusion was ex-
pelled, and the public opinion disabused m telation
to the ability of this Government to legulate and
control the paper medium supplied by the State
banks Congress never has done this, and never
cando, wehave not the power, it lesides in the
States, and they alone can apply a remedy If there
are petitioners here, i« is our duty to lefer them to
the States The evils of our papci s}stemaretoo
deeply rooted, and its ramification-, too extensive, to
be reached by any indirect measures of Congress
It is idle, theiefoie to kepp up this delusion, and
now, sir, is the time to dispel it One branch of the
Government, che Executive, has done its duty, at
this great crisis m our monetary affairs, he has
spoken with the fearlessness and honest} which be-
came the chief magisti ate ol an enlightened peo-
ple The President has done his duty, let Congress
do its duty Let us boldly and honestly tell those
vv ho appl} hei e lorthe cor' ection of the evils of the
paper cunency, that we have no po\ ci to apply a
remedy, that thev have mis'aken the tribunal, and
appealed to the wrong forum Let us refer them to
the Stales, let us tell them th-n the remedy is m
their ow n hands, and that it depends on themselves
whether they will continue to sctffer all the evils of
a deprecated and vicious paper currency, unset-
tling the value of propeity, deranging all the pui-
suits of business, and conuptmg the moials of the
community or appl} an adequate remedy Mi JH
said he had no doubt w hat w ould be then final de
cisión on this great question, he concuired fully
with the distinguished author of the letter to Sher-
lod Williams, tha1 ai mtelligent"pcople,like those
composing the States of this contedeiacj, will not
long stand by aad see the cut rent j of their íespect
ivc States corrupted the value of then pioperty
unsettled, and all then interests deranged, by the
imprudence oi cpt^dity of the 'i'i)ki"¿ corpora-
tions without nndu g and enforcing an effectual,
and, at the same time, a constm'lonal remedy '
Such temedy the} cannot find here
What, then, do gentl"" nen ex ec , can be fin thet
done foi the relief of the count y1 Those who so
earnest!} call for measures o' relief, he thought were
bound to suggest their \ lans He should like to see
their relief measuies lhe jovonte measure of
relief we all understand, but, as they cannot obtain
mat, what aie then other measujc i Would they
have Congress attempt to regu'ate the commeice ol
the people, a^ well as the currenc) of the States1
Would thev have *be Government inteifere in the
private puisaits cf the citizens to help them out of
their diflicultiesi If w e had the pbwei, such mtei-
fcrence would most assuredly only make matters
worse, and, he feared, be soon denounced as anoth-
er " experiment"
To the solemn appeals to the majorit} for some
healing measure to iclieve the merchants and others
fiom c xistmg embarnssments and t help them m
their private affans, he would applv the opinions of
tw o great men and pi ofound thinkers " Projectors,"
savs Adam Smith, "distuib nature m the course
of her operations m human adán-, and it íeqmies
no more than to let hei alone, and give her fair play
in the pursuit of hei ends, that she may establish
hei designs Little else is tequisite to eairy a State
to the highest degiee ol opulence, from the lowest
baibarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a toleiable
administration ol justice all the l est being brought
about by the natural course of thing*- ' This brief
sentence contains the pnnciples which lie at the
foundation of the immortal work of that great man
The othei opinion is from Thomas Jefferson,
scarcely inferior as a philosopher and moie expe-
rienced as a piactical statesman In Ins first inau-
gural address, w here w e find more profound and
just political maxims than in any oihei publication
ol the same extent in this or any o'her age or
countij, he asks the question, " what farther is «ant-
ed to complete thegeneral pro^peiity !' andanswers
n as follows ' One tl mg moie a w ise and fi ngal
government, which shall restiam men from injui-
mgone another, shall leave them otherwise free
to legulate then own pursuits of mdustrj and ím-
piovement, and shall not take from the mouth of
labor he bread it has earned " Heie, m a few
vvoids, we have the three great íequisites of a wise
and good government, protection and security, en-
tire freedom in private pursuits, and light taxes, or
an economical administration
