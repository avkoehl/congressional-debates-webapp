large, btfi from nothing, by the magic energies of
free trade. Such a result would indeed be the
crowning glory of that "policy—^a result that the
Secretary is in a fair way of reaching by a very
free trade in figures. «
But the error does not stop here. Another mis-
take in -the mode of making up the accounts of Im-
ports and exports remains to be corrected, and
fliis correction will still further increase the amount
of foreign merchandise consumed, and from wKich
the revenae was derived? The amount of foreign
merchandise exported, exclusive of specie, is stated
to be $7,986,806. Of this amount, the sum of
$2,869,941 was withdrawn from the warehouses,
ps will appear from the report on commerce and
navigation, to which I have referred. This class
of imports, not having been entered for payment
of duties or consumption, forms therefore no part
of the total imports enumerated in the tables before
tis, ami consequently should not be deducted there-
from in ascertaining the amourjtof foreig'n goods
consumed. In the calculation oefore submitted,
tins sum, being included in the amount of foreign
goods exported, was deducted from the total im-
ports. To correct- that calculation, this sum of
§2,869,941, improperly deducted,should be added
to the-result there obtained, viz: $140,631,216.
"By this additten, we have the sum of one hunflred
and forty-three millions five hundred and one
thousand one hundred and fifty-seven dollars, the
true amount of foreign merchandise, exclusive oP
spec!*-, consumed, and from which the revenue was
realized. The Secretary states this amount to be
#137,490,012. We then have— .
True amount of foreign merchandise consumed..$143.501,157

An eiror of sixteen millions in a document re-
garded by the friends of free trade as a text book,
js one of no small importance. It affects the argu-
ment and weakens the conclusions of the Secre-
tary. It explains what had before surprised and
almost confounded the advocates of the protective
policy. 1 do not charge the Secretary with willful
concealment or misrepresentation of the facts. He
may not he immediately responsible for the errors
in the tables he has- submitted with his report. 1
know that these tables are made up by gentlemen
connected with the Treasury Department, whose
•appropriate business it is to prepare them for the
Secretary. But I hold the Secietary responsible
in this: that he adopted these tables without ex-
amination or revision; that he assumed them to be
cm feet without testing, by data within his reach,
their correctness; and that upon these tables,
abounding m errors, he based an argument in"
favor of his peculiar system, whi<jh he and his
friends deem ro be conclusive against those who
oppose his theories. The Secretary owes it to
himself, to his friends, and the country, to explain
these discrepancies. He should restate his argu-
ment, and admit that the imports, instead of being
♦'comparatively small," were unusually large.
The statements of the report having been cor-
rected, let us briefly review the practical operation
of the act of 1846; arid first, in relation to the im-
ports and exports of specie for the fiscal year 1843.
The amount of opecie exported can be ascertained
from the tables in the report; the amount imported
cannot with accuracy, as we have already shown
an error- of more than thirteen millions in the
amount derived from tfce tables. The true amount
imported, according to the statement of the Register
of the Treasury, is "$6,359,854. The exports of
specie for the same period were $15,841,616; show-
ing a balance against us, in the specie account, of
$9,481,762. In 1847, the specie balance in our
fftvor was $22,276,370: against us in 1848, $9,481,-
762; exhibiting a change against us in one year of
$31,757,932. This result is not very favorable to
the country, or to the operation of the present sys-
tem of low duties. The Secretary, however, says
"all this specie must soon come back to our coun-
try." It may be so; I fear his system, in its prac-
tical operation, is but ill calculated to cause its
return. One fact is certain: specie is still leaving
our country in large quantities, and must continue,
so long as excessive importations of foreign goods
continue. The time of its return is not yet.
Again, as regards the general balance of trade.
The Secretary, in his report, says:
" It appears also from the table that eo far from this tarifi
having filled the countiy with foreign goods beyond its. ca-
pacity for consumption, the domestic expoit last year, ex-*
elusive of specie, actually exceeded by the sum (per Fame
table) of $2,713,597, the foreign imports, exclusive of spe-
cie, consumed the same year,in the United States, inclu-
ding all articles but specie, both free mi'! dutiable, thus
showing a-balance of foreign trade in our favor."
Here is the declaration of the honorable Secre-
tary. Does it accord with the fact? Let us see:
Foreign merchandise consumed, exclusive of
specie $143,501,157
Domestic exports, exclusive of specte ' 130,*203,709
Actual balance against us  13.297,448
This shows the balance to he against us of
$13,297,448, instead of $2,700,000 in our favor, as
stated in the report. In 1847 the balance of foreign
trade in favor of the United States was $12,102,-
984; balance against us in 1848, §13.297,448; a
change against us in one year of §25,400,432. If
such facts as these furnish any proof of the bene-
ficial operation of the act of 1846, I cannot dis-
cover it.
Let us now look at the revenue, and the imports
from which it was derived, in 1848, as compared
with the revenue and imports in 1845, under the
act'of 1842:
In 1848, yndc.r actof 1846, the net revenue was$31,757,070
In 1845, under act of 184-2, the net revenfcp was 27,538,112
Increase of levcnue under the act of 1846.. 4,239,958
This is one side of the question. Now idt us
examine the other:
Jn 1848 the imports consumed were $14,1,501.157
In 1845 the imports consumed were  105,599,541
Increase of imports under act of 1846  37,902,616
This statement shows that whilst the increase in
the revenue was four millions two hundred thou-
sand dollars, the increased importations were near-
ly thirty-eight millions of dollars. To place four
millions additional revenue in the treasury, you
have taken from the pockets of the people thirty-
eight millions to pay for foreign productions, which
neither their wants nor interests demanded. You
have substituted thirty-eight millions of foreign
productions for that amount of domestic produc-
tions—substituted foreign labor for home labor 
paralyzed the industry and checked the prosperity
of our own country, by encouraging and promoting
the interests of other nations; and all this to in"
crease vour revenue four millions! Under the act
of 1842, an equal amount of imports would have
yielded atleast thirty-nine millions three hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars, taking the aver-
age rate of duty in 1845 as the basis of calculation.
The loss, therefore, in revenue alone, by the re-
peal of the act of 1842, and the enactment of the
act of 1846, on the imports of 1848, "is nearly eight
millions. I admit that the importations would not
have been so lar^e, had the act of 1842 been in
operation; but an equal amount of revenue would
have been realized from a much smaller amount of
imports. The condition of Europe and our country
during the year 1848, would necessarily have
caused an increase of imports under any revenue
system, but not so great as under the act of 184G-
But will this act, as a revenue measure, meet
the expectations of its friends? The returns for
the first quarter, ending September 30, 1R48, of
the present fiscal year, compared with the returns
for the corresponding quarter of the last year,
show a large decrease in the receipts from customs.
The comparison is as follows:
$11,106,257
8,991,835
1847, first qr., ending Sept. 30, net revenue.
1848, do do ' do 
Decrease in receipts from customs  9,114,3-22
Now let us compare the receipts of the first
quarter of the present year with those of a corre-
sponding quarter in the year 1845, under the act :
of 1842: ;
1845, first qr., ending Sept, 30, net revenue $10,873,718 |
1848, do do do  8,991,935 ;
Excess in favor of act of 1842  1,881,783 {
I It is thus seen that the receipts for the first
j quarter, ending September 30, 1845, of that fiscal I
: yeac, tinder the act of 1842, exceed those of a I
I corresponding quarter in 1848, nearly §2,000,000; !
the importations for these quarters being larger in <
1848 than in 1845. The act of 1846, as a revenue !
measure, like every system of low duties, will :
ultimately fail. Increased revenues, under low '
duties, can only be derived from increased import- I
ations. Increased importations depend more upon
the_ ability of the people to consume, than upon
legislation. Excessive importations, by substi-
tuting the foreign for home productions—by cheap-
ening labor, and depriving it of its employment
and reward, impair this ability to consume, to
purchase the cheap goods of foreign workshops.
Unable to purchase, importations diminish and
your revenues decline. Such has ever been the
practical operation of these systems.
The Secretary, as we have seen, complains "that
the high duties under the act of 1842 were rapidly
substituting the domestic articles, and exeludmgthe
foreign rival." No such cause of complaint exists
against the act of 1846. It has yielded everything
to the " foreign rival." The foreign rival has taken
I the place, to a great extent, off our domestic pro-
ductions. Our markets are glutted with it. Every
1 counter in the country is covered with British and
foreign productions. Every branch of domestic
industry has been affected by the enormous im-
portations under this act. Its ruinous effects have
not yet been fully developecj. They have been
delayed by the extraordinary and exciting circum-
stan#is connected with our European trade. These
have passed away; and we are now beginning to
f:e 1, deeply feel, the fatal effects of disregarding the
true interests of home and country, and encouraging
and cherishing a "foreign rival."
Let us refer to some particular interests affected
by this state of things. I will select the uon inter-
est, one in which Pennsylvania is deeply interested. ,
Time will not permit extended details. The im-
j ports ofiron and its manufactures in value, during
i the whole period of the act of 1842, (four years
! and three months,) were §26,358,479, as appears
by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
made in answer to the resolution of the House on
this subject. The imports of iron and its manu-
factures, under the act of 1846, from December
1st, 1846, to June 30th, 1848, (a period of seven-
teen months,) were, as appears by the same report,
$18,196,281. This latter period is just one-third
of the former, and yet the imports are but eight
millions less. If the imports under the act of 1846
should be continued in the same proportion for a
period equal to the duration of the act of 1846,
they would amount to the sum of g54,588,843—■
more than double the imports under the act of
1842. The annual import of iron and its manu-
factures now exceed twelve millions of dollars.
Under the low duties of our present system it
must increase. The result will be the rum of this
branch of industry. In view of these facts, is it
surprising that Pennsylvania feels, and is, deeply
injured by the operation of the present system
of low duties? Is it surprising, that at the late
Presidential election, she repudiated an Admin-
istration that has waged a war of extermination
against her best interests? The large amount of
foreign iron thrown into our markets, under the
present system, has had a most paralyzing effect
upon this interest. It has ruinously affected, noi
only the capital, but the labor employed in the
manufacture. Pennsylvania demands some pro-
tection against the ruinous competition of foreign
monopolists. Our workmen and mechanics, hon-
est and industrious, demand it. Suffering now
from the effects of your ill-timed and ill-advised
legislation, they ask to be relieved. Shall their
demands be heeded? Will we, wedded to a sys-
tem of free trade—a system foreign to our inter-
ests, and favorable only to foreign interests—turn
a deaf ear to their entreaties, and refuse the re-
lief that must sooner or later be yielded to them?
Whatever this Administration has done, or may
do, a better day has dawned upon the country.
We require all that our hopes prompt us to ex-
pect. The real, not imaginary prostration of this
branch of industry and its kindred, the mining
interest, must not be suffered to continue. Do gen-
tlemen doubt that real cause of complaint exists?
Let them go to our iron and coal regions, and ex-
amine for themselves. Let them witness the results
of the system they advocate, and which they aided'
in forcing upon theliountry. They would doubt
no longer. The extinguished fires of our furnaces *
—the deep stillness of our rolling-mills—the silence '
of the deserted mine—the honest laborer without
employment—all, pronounce the condemnation of
your poficy, and plead eloquently "against the
deep damnation of their taking off."
