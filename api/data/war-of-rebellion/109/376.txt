Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD:

I have reconnoitered the pike toward Manchester and find it clear for my trains. The trains will be moved forward, starting at 3 a. m. to-morrow, and my troops will march at 6, General Davis in advance. Please send me the Associated Press dispatches that you receive. My troops are all here snugly and comforably encamped.

Very respectfully,

General DAVIS:

General McCook directs that you move your command forward on the Manchester pike to this point, where your division will be placed in a good camp by a fine stream. Give us timely notice of your arrival. Your division will not have to move beyond this point this evening.

Your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

General JOHNSON:

General McCook directs that you can unharness your artillery horses and the mules of your ordnance and wagon trains to-night, but that the animals must be harnessed by 3 a. m. to-morrow and all ready to be hitched up a moment's notice. The order about being ready, &amp;c., by 3 a. m. is imperative.

By command of Major-General McCook;

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

General SHERIDAN:

General McCook directs that you send one brigade of your division, by way of Fairfield, to follow in the rear of General Thomas' column, now en route from Fairfield to Manchester. Push the other brigades of your division directly forward to Manchester from this place. They should reach Manchester to-night. If wagon trains impede your progress, turn them off the road and pass your troops. If you cannot reach Manchester to-night, comply with the order as far as you can.

My headquarters will be at this place to-night.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
