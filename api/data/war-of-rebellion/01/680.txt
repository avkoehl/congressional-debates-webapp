too bad to be robbed by our friends. If you can apply any corrective to this I shall feel under great and lasting obligations.

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.

P. S.- The service cannot be anticipated by requisitions. Authority must be given to the quartermaster to draw for money, say for $100,000 McKinstry is heartily disposed to do all that he can for the maintenance been put afloat by those who want his position here.

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 4, 1861.

General C. B. McCLELLAN, Cleveland, Ohio:

Your dispatch received. No order sent from here to Emory to fall back on Leavenworth. Probably the order went direct from Washington. The purport of you dispatch will be forwarded by telegraph to Army headquarters.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., May 6, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

I have intelligence from Colonel F. P. Blair and his aide, F. A. Dick, of Saint Louis, that it is quite probable some of the forces of Indiana may be required in Saint Louis at the time of the encampment of the State troops there. Shall I observe the order of Colonel Blair in sending troops to Saint Louis?

Answer immediately.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. P. MORTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 6, 1861.

Gov. O. P. MORTON, Indianapolis:

Obey no order from Mr. Blair, or any one else, other than officer duly authorized to give orders.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, May 9, 1861.

Colonel FRANK P. BLAIR, Jr., Saint Louis:

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and beg leave, in reply, today that it is impracticable for this Department to give authority to the quartermaster at Saint Louis to draw money at this pleasure. It is impossible, whatever may be the disposition of the Department, to place $100,000 at his disposal in the manner you suggest.

Very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
