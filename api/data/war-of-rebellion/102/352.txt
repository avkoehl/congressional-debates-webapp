WARRENSBURG, May 8, 1865-7. 55 p. m.

General DODGE:

It is reported to me that 700 rebels are marching on Sedalia. How they could get through Blunt's or Sanborn's lines I cannot imagine. I do not believe the story true. I shall know in a short time. I shall go to the assistance of Captain Hamilton if the story be true.

The report of 700 men coming into Sedalia is now said to be paroled men who reported at Springfield. I do not believe a word of either account.

The cavalry have reported from Versailles and are hard at work. There are two parties, one of 110 men in complete uniform at Kingsville and one of 30 at
