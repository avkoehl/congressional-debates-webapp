GOLDSBOROUGH, [April 27,] 1865.

Generals DODGE and ABBOTT:

Johnston yesterday surrendered all men and munitions of war in North and South Carolina and Georgia on the same terms that Lee had. Jeff. Davis is a fugitive. All but the Twenty-third and Tenth Corps will be going home soon. I leave here about 10 o'clock for Wilmington.

A copy of the parole which General Sherman will require from Johnston's army will be sent you, and the commanding general desires you to require Colonel Whitford and his command to give the same parole.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT,New Berne, N. C., April 27, 1865.

Brigadier General EDWARD HARLAND,

Commanding at Kinston, N. C.:

GENERAL: General Palmer directs me to say that any cavalry at Moseley Hall and in the vicinity are to be considered as temporarily attached to your command so long as they are in the limits of your sub-division. They will be taken up on your reports in red ink, in the usual way. No other troops than the Eighty-fifth New York Volunteers, belonging regularly to the district, have been ordered to Moseley Hall.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. JUDSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., April 27, 1865. (Received 10. 50 a. m. 29th.)

Major-General SHERMAN:

I am informed that the couriers started from Savannah for Macon yesterday, with every precaution taken to insure success. General Potter's command has returned to Georgetown, and I wish to keep it moving, but do not know whether you want me to strike for any particular place or not. I can move it to any place within the States of South Carolina or Georgia. If Wilson's cavalry is not to go to Augusta perhaps I had better send it there. I will wait three or four days to hear from you. This is not sent by a special boat.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
