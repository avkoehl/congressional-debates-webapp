own regiments had been there this would not have occurred, and I consider its falling back unnecessary. I have sent over the Eleventh Maine to hold the line. I think the enemy are intrenching on the New Market and Malvern Hill road.

DEEP BOTTOM, July 26, 1864-6.40 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH:

This morning the enemy forced back my picket-line below Four-Mile Creek, and a point where we have no command of the wood or New Market or Malvern Hill roads. I have ordered another regiment over from here and shall try and retake the line from a point where I can command them. I have ordered two regiment of the Nineteenth Corps on this side of the creek, and will try and work t hem in with my men. I have virtually no stronger force than before these re-enforcements came. Numbers of the Nineteenth Army Corps are reported as captured when the line fell back last night, but I have not been able to get any details.

Was that portion of the line recovered?

HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., TENTH ARMY CORPS, Deep Bottom,July 26, 1864-8 a.m.

Brigadier General G. WEITZEL,

Chief of Staff, Department of Virginia and North Carolina:

I regret to say that I have not only not recovered that portion of the line lost night, but through the shameful conduct of the troops of Colonel Curries' brigade have lost more. I can place no reliance at all here? I have sent over the Eleventh Maine and Tenth Connecticut from my own brigade and shall recover all the line possible. The entire picket-line of the brigade of the Nineteenth Army Corps abandoned their line and fell back to the entrenchments at a slight skirmish fire of not over fifty shots. In re-enforcing that portion of the line, I have necessarily weakened greatly my line on this side of the creek.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General FOSTER:

The firing heard is blank cartridge firing by colored troops. Have you ascertained your loss yet in falling back? Do you still hold crest?
