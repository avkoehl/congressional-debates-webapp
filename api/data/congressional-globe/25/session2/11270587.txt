Mr Chairman ,/The object of th-ubiíl und-*i considera ion ^
tosupply the wants üfth«Goveiiimuit by an is&ue of icn mil
lions ofTreasury notefi    I wvo % es, therefore an inquiry n,to
the nature and extent of those want?, and the best moans of
supplying them
In common With many who have spoken on this v-itl othei
occasions, I must complain of a want uf that infoimauo i tit-ces
sary to detei mine the first qu stion to my own fc.atisia.aion If
I look to the various statements furnished this llou^e by tho t
whose official stations make it theu duty to alftud this informa
tton, I find so wide a diffeienoe between them that I cannot rely
«pon the eatit iatea thus furnished wi h that certainty and satis
faction which a representative oughtto fee! when rutins away
the money ( f his constituents When I Imk to the íeport of
the Secretary of the Treasury, submme 1 at the present session,
I find tint he makes the whoit amount commit into th** 1 rea
su^y the present, yeai $33,015 7S7 The ch uiman >i the Com
mitteeot Ways and Means, the next be-.t authuity on dll sub
jerti connected with the finances, has recently f.voied the
Home with a speech, in which he foo^s up the receipts at
about the same sum But, m comnanng the item* which com
pne these aggregates, I find a mo^tsm   using differente in the
amount of almost every one of them The Secretary calculate 
the amount to be received ftom usioms and salee of land at
$18I500000, the chairman of the committee sets downtbdtiu.m
at $15,000 030, a diffeience «fthree and a half millions ot Jol
lais This vanance is very gieat, and, however it may meet
with some excuse from the fau that the estimate mast, liomits
nature, be conjectural, yet it would have been much moio satis
f ictory to me and I think to tho n ition, had some reason or
plausible supposiuon been given lor so gieat a reduction 1 he
n^xthem howeVer, appeals to me sull mure extiaoidmary,

postponed b >nds and bank balances falling due with n tht year
is matter of reeoid, and should wí mu of no m intake JIo v, then,
shall we account for this vast difference?
[Mr Cambrbleng here intei posed, and said With tlie per
mission of the gentleman from Indiana, he would exp'am to
him and the co rtmrttce that, on examining this subject, ¿n eru.
¿xdbeen di5Coveied m the S"C emy's estimate líe had not
allowe Í enough for the postpone ibondt, and, t heroine in cor
rec'ing that error, he had set down the s.um to be received it ten
million", mute d of the «urn giv¿n by the secretary
Mr Cubtis here desired to inquire of his colle urne, fhechan
mail of the Oomrmt'ec of Ways and Means at what sum he had
esimatelthe postponed du y bo ds falling due thisyear?
Mi  Cambreceng answered about six mii'ioi s J
Mr IK nn proceeded Toi all the purpose-- I hid invleA,
Mr Chairman, the explanation d íes not help the matter It was
n >t my inte mon to go into ilu. inquiry at this time who was
light or who was wrong, m re/aul to this estimate, but to show
t > the committee how little reliance could be placed upon these
official repot ts fiom the Department, and o remove from my
eeif and others the clamor that is attempted a' our expense that,
when we seek to investigate th?se matters for ourselves, wi ait
con upftingtimftunnecesamly, and endeavoring to bankiuj t the
Government Sir, this is the charge put forth against u-* al
though but two days have yet been speut in the co sideiation of
thts bill If I had iaith in the accuracy of the«e ofiicial state
uisnts I might take them upon trust But who can ask that of
me, after the explanation just given*
It is admitted that a mistake of two million5' of d dlais has
bsen made in theTieasuxy report of last December and never
diocoveied antd now, orr if discovered before, never accounted
for to this House or the nation and which, perhaps never
would have been accounted for, but for what has just ta<ien
place
Sir, it s«emi to me that when an officer of -this Government
commits an en or of such magnitude m his official corretón
dence with this body, a due reg-udtot usandfoi himself would
require an ample and immediate official explanation I will
not, however, dwell further upon this topic, but pass to ano hei
íem
The next one which I wi^h to otiee is the annum of Tn,i
sury notes undei he act o Octob^U&tí remain!ii<r to he issu? I
i'urmgíthe fiscal year lhi> oi hng to tht Tieasmet, is
S^OOjOOO, but, according totb<? ^ urman of the Committee vf
Ways and Meaos, is sev^n millions, showing a difference of
$1300,000 ThtsaUo, Mr Char «tar ,h ing a mere mattei of
figures, should admit of no misuw, and, to say the least of it,
shows agreat n ¡jligence in the ni diing up of thewestatement-
Again, sir In the item whicn follows is a much greater va !
nance The balance of mone v\hicn would remain in the
Treasury on the 1st of January ^e is estimated by the Secre
tary at ^1,08^493, wmle the cha man of the committee reduces
tí to $500,000, a difference of ra.ra than one half How can
thielwl                                     ,            ,                        ^     ,
[Mr CAJaBRíü-ENO requested to txplam, and say, that the es
uiiAte-oftheSecreta!y was made upa month before theclose of
the-rear. and therefore wascoBjectoial His statemeet, being
made afterwards, gave thetruearnount.1
Mr. Dükn proceeded Be it so, sir Ido net expect that the
estimatecould be precisely corree , but here is a difference of
50 per cent and more, and that, too, when the Secretary pre
ten«s t'  «ive us, toa dollar, the exa-t balance that will remain
hi t v> Treiisury It o ly aSbrts further evidence how danger
ouí it wril be, wheti,legislating on ütese subjects, to rely upon
Che s¿ñl or accuracy of the Dep trtment m question
Nowr sir, take the statements thu= furnished by the Secretary
and by the gentleman from New Yoife, (Mr CambrblenqJ and
select the laigest items contained m each, and it gives us an in-
come of thirty *ix and a ha I n íllions In Uk* manner, take the
smallest sums given by each, and it makes the revenue twenty
imie million*-a deference of seven anda half millions, n arly
the whole sura asked by this bill And yet, sir, with alt these
palpab'edisciepin íesbeforeus, when we hesitate, when we
¡stop to mqune when we complain of being compelled to \ote
upon such nnancienng, h*oh0zird, and m such haste, the gen
tleman hom South Carolina [Mr EhettI threatens us with, the
vengeat ce of the people calls it a refusal of supplies for the re
cei^tT) wmts of the Government, and is pleased tocompareour
to ihict with that of i party m Congress whicn voted against
supplies, totaiiv on th* la e war with Great Britain
lrul>, sir, I an at a loss to know wheiethat gentleman finas
uus lor eithai hischaige oi compauson T^itre has been no
lefu^a'to vote supplies Iha\e heard nogentleinan say that
he w uld not vo e for all that was demanded, even by the lame
audita curate estimates furnished to us Even that gentle
man s t dleagne ]Mi Thompson ] when he declared that the
IIou v  uld be justifiibie m irelusmg, at the same time stated
that lie \ ould give what was a<¡ked And has not the Opposi
ion, an 1 mote th i n once, too, offered an immediate issue of more
i iintw> m Huns of Treasury notes for present emergencies,
a id thus afford tune to look into this important measure; and
whn,sir h ts voted that proposition dtfwn? Have we not time
an 1 yun md months airo, besought the<Yiend^of the Admi-
tí stiat o i 11 iurnish the House with a statement of all the de
m inti-. a  mit the Government, and moie especially oi tht, 11©
ridt war, accompanied with a * offer to supply the whole sum
at oncei It is true, sir, we gave ample notice that, befoie we
could consult to vote foi appropriations foi new operations,
we should insist upon an m ceatigation into tht extiavagant and
wastt tul expendituie ol turner sums And how have H
thee tan and honorabh propositions been met by the domi
nam party heic* Why, sn lejetted with disdain Let it not
be said, then, that we are withholding supplies
And, was it so, largely must the gentleman have drawn upon
his imagination, when he likened it to the opposition of the mi
noniy in Oonsress to furnish supplies fot the last war Are
the dicumstancesof the count y thesamo? Are weengased
m a struggle with the most powu ful nation on the globe? JDo
the footsteps of a f>mgn fwe pollute our soil? Are her ships
ho\em g ovei oui coa^tl No sir And if there is no similau
ty in this respect, can the gentleman find it in the character
and ability of thestatp?men of that and the pre-ent day? Will
heompaic the .entieman v.ho now fills the Executive chair
with that exalted mm who though now gone down to tre
toinh, cm itev ( be forgot en? Will he liken the present head
of the Tie* uiy Depirtmtnt to the abe financier who then

Can we say so now? But si-, bad is our iiJeio are, they
still belong to my country, «m II will not pursue the comparison
fuiihei
Taking iht sum demandt d as the n tie one, I next desire your
attention to the ol!i«i question which I propuse to consider, viz
the best me hod of laismg the amount needed And here, sir,
let mo say, that not the least obiection tble feature of this trans
action, in my es imaHon is the attempt to d ctate to this ITou^e
tht mode did manner of jíroMiiug th s supply This power of
ong natmg the ways and means placed so entirely within our
contiol—mo j^a ou^ly swarded by the f amersof ourC n-^titu
tu>n from dl mtPtfeience is tobe prohibited to the other branch
oí Congre s— hitherto htl 1 eo sacre 1 that, on more than one oc-
casion, this. House ha^ spurntl fiom i mea^uies emanating
from thit quaiter n erely b^c uise, by possibility t ey might
be construed into an encmachment upon this authority—should
be kept s ill more careful y fiom the pollution of Executive in
ttrfeienct liow much better wo ltd it have been more re
sppc fnl to this II >u*p, more creditable to the Administration,
to have pumitted thií- matter to remain open to the unbiassed
actio i of ihellouaf But, instead of that we find a particular
c mrsedí si ¡mated for up an! gentlemen of high stand mii wi h
the Administration tell u-* in a tone of authority, that they will
have this measuie earned, or they will have n me Sir, when

trcKoble for the sifety of tht country
*ir, we h tve a dutv to peiform to tho"c who sent us here,
xnd m lefeienc ¡o the bill bef re us that du'y is to inquire
whether the me hod propped by the administration is she best
one foreuppyirg the wants of the Treasury And, lor one, I
inten 1 to ma-,e that mq my, and act according as my judgment
«hall determine it
We hive aooat ten mil ions of rlinrn falling due us within

Tni«, I conceive, wot id fee our course in private life No
man Kc míng embarra sed, and holding notes and bonds of
others m good rreht, and which could be cashed would
tbmkof ltosumg mis own pap^r, and compelling his creditors to
take it
But su ifwemust havere^ort toourcredit, is there no other
wav of mna k that will h& more effectual f >r the purpose in
tended and more saMBUstory to thecountty? If the object is
simply to raise money and pay offour debts, what are the inte
resta that snonl 1 be co*">aitei'i Surely the first sho ild be that
j of our creditors, the poor and honest men we have heard
about, to whom, u is said we owe this m*mey Which of the
two modes a loan oi anisette ol notes, will be mostsatisiactory
to thenY! In the one case thev will g«t paper promises m the
other they will ?et money, and hard nion«y teo, if thev rfesire
it Sir, we have heard tríuch about the credit of this Govern

or eitver Is there any of thi* sqneamishness manifested m the
pre^nt m^a^urt? We are ofTáring' the Adnnmstration gold and
stivci th > e t listín17 up in irredeemable Government paper
S i, I havi t*nauthont> at i a d qui'e to th* purpose—an autho
rity which will uov be disputed in all that relates to hard money
It is the aigumeiv of one high in favor with the Admmisy&iio 
one who, if iepait speaks true, has a pre-emptio7i ektint vp&tt
the nex^ vacancy m the Wbue House
In a recent speech made by that gentleman, {Mr BbstonJ
upon the propriety of receiving specie paying bank wotes by
the Government, he employs argutiiem* so apt to my purpose
on this occasion, that 1 could not add to thetii, if I wished, Ms
Stiys
1 It is the most revoluoff proposition ever made ¿n tmsCun-
gi ess! It is a flagrant violation of the Constitution, by making
papei money a tendei both to and from the Government* It is
fraught with ruinand desti uction to the public pSoper$, ¿hie
publicTiea-mry, and the public creditors The not s o* am 
hundred banks are tobe leceived into dm Treasury, aud djs.
bursed from the Treasury Thty are to be paid out as well as
pud m The iidiculous proviso of willingness to receive
them on the part of the public creditor u an insult to him for
theie is no choice, ilis that ornothins The disbursing officer
does not offer hard ononey with one hand and paper with the
o'het,and tell the creditor to take his choice No' he offers
paper oí nothing' To talk of willingness when there is no
choice la msuh, mockery, and outrage Great is the kws of po-
pularity which this Administration has sustained from paying
 ut depreciated paper, great the deception which has been
oractised upon the Government in representing this paper as
being willingly received Necessity, and not good wili, ruled
the creditor, indignation, resentment, and. execrations on the-Ad-
ministration, were the thanks with which he received it This
has disgraced and injured the Administration inore than ad
other causes out together, it nao ios* it tens of thousands of true
faends It uenow getting into a condition topayhaid money,
and this resolution comes to prevent «uch payment, and to
continue and peipeiuate the ruinous paper money payments
Defeat the íesolution, and the Government will quickiv pay ail
demands upon it m gold and silver, and will recover its pupu
Uiny pass it, and paper money will continue to bs paid out,
and the Administration will continue to lo*e giound "
Wh it could be moi e apposite to tht occasion on hand? IIow-
everoome of us might question ihe applicability of the argu-
mem to bank notes redeemable on demand in speue-, yet nona
can doubt its full foi ceas regaids inconvertible Treasury notes^
always below specie par, and most frequently beyond that of
non specie paying bank notes Sufficient forme is it, that it
completely refutes any supposition that our creditors would
piefer these notes to money, which the course we propose wi I
^ive them Let those gentlemen, then, w ho profess-so much re
gtrd for the public cieditoi, and who contend that to offer him
bank nolfs payab'e and paid on demand on demand in specie is
"ifisult, 7fiockeiy} and outrage," reconcile this forcing upon
him ofTreasury paper
If the course we piopose is thus better foi the men we owe,
let me ask if there is any interest of die cotmtty that forbids it
I know, sir, it has been both at Ihe last and present session,
contended that by the issue ofTreasury notes no debt was creat
ei, it w as no loan ot money 1 he Fiesidem, in his September
lnesaaEe, hoi Is this doctrine
' It la not proposed to procure the tequired amount by loans
or increased taxation " * * 'treasury notes may he
temporarily issued to be gradually ledecmcd as it (amountdue
uslie received "
Tmi*, also, chimes m the Sauetary of theTieasury, m his
repoitat lie simesesnun
"It need not be a lo n, or an increase nf taxes of any kind "
*       "One mode would be lo authorize an l^sue of Tiea
sury Motas, receivable for all public dues, but without intei cm"
And even very recently, the char man of th« Committee of
Ways and Means used the following languagt
"We have heard much, si& here and elsewhere, abom a
bankrupt Treasury, loaTts aitd a, pttbttc debt. Such statemeute
and anticipations are wilhoulfoundation "
'There is nothing sir, m the past or present condition of the
Tieasuiy, nor m the prospect ahead, to warrant this charge of
bankruptcy, orto authorize npubltcdebt "
Then, sir, the very beauty oí the Tieasury note scheme was,
that it was no loan, created no public debt a position to plainly
un'enable, that the good sense oi the genth;man from Sou ti
CirohnajMr Uhett] will not permit him to occupy it I e
gives it up And, in doing that, he abandons the.wholegieynd
Kver since the measure has been under consi eiation, both vt
the la'e and the pres"nt session, how has the Opposition been
stismatized as the paj er party—the party desirous of plunging
the country m dtbtt l rejoicp, sir, that the admission has been
made, that this charge is renoved from eui shoulders, and
placed where it belongs But, sir, should we leave the subject
without inquiring why it was ever made? Was it, sir, because
Gen Jackson had just boasted of havinsc paid off the national
debt? That the pounds of rejoicing on that occasion had not
yet died away in the distance, and the paity dared not acknow-
ledge that already they were compelled to create a new one?
¡sir, I congratulate the 'people that they ara to be deceived i o
longer
Then sir, whether we is«ue ten millions of Treasury notes,
or ten millions of stock certificates, they alike cieate a debt
¿gamn the Government for the same amount There can fce
no difference in that respect
It would, perhaps, ht> doing injustice te- the gentleman from
Sooth Carolina [Mr IIhett ] not to say that he did attempt to
m<tke a distinction between a tern { oraiy i d a peimanentdebt
Foi allthr purposes of my argument it is immaterial whether
it be temporary or permanent, which only means that o«e shall
be paid off a little sooner than another Either i  a charge up
on the country and I fancy will he paid as soon as the country
is able to do it But, su, the gentleman expressed his surprise
that th« proposition for a loan should come from the South
And he then went over an argument which I have very often
h^ard belore, that the South pays much more than her fair pro
portion of the revenue of this Government by reason of ¿is
operation of your taaff laws, a d, therefore, (ct mended the
gentle nan,) a permanent debt would be onerrus upon the
%outh lam truly ata lo*s to know, sir, by what procer the
South wiliescape fiom paying the same proportion of this debt
whether ltbe temporary or permanent There may be some
necromancy «b«ut it that Ido not understand It ie, however,
the other position assumed by the ¡rentleman, and by ether gen*
tlemen from ihe South, upon almost every occasion—the me
qualify of the tariff law*—tVatl w.sh to examine
It can only be maintained by the assumption that the &*!%?&*
of that section of the c mptry purchase and use more foreign
goods than the same number of citizens m other sections feucb.
seem to be the settled opinions of Southern gentlemen, and we
have an amusing instance of the faet in die argument made the
other day by another gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr
Phx&s 3   Von may mollee*, sir, te, in support of the Oum«
