says, after having cnaiged me with these two crimps, and calí

without—he says the House might well expel me.
The SPEAKER here interrupted Mi Adams With the inquiry
whethei he had acquiesced in'the decision of the Speaker, or had
taken an app^l therefrom
Mr ADAMS If the Speaker thinks pi oper to decide that the
resol utjon is not m order, and the Ü * abt acquiesces in that den
sion, the thing is done—there is an end ot it I do not want to
consume time unnecessarily J3u[ if the Speaker is to decide
that the matter is to b loit to the decision of the House, I must
proceed m my remarks I do not w¡ h to dicta e to the Speaker
but m my opinion the Speaker ought nof to have lereivel the

me, but thtt it is their duty to dismiss it, \\H11 the contempt it

order?                                              ,    ,
Mi WISE (add essmg die Speaker) said he ro^e to inquire of
thebpeaker wi ethei hi* (Mr WV) chaiaCter 01 cjuduct was
invo vtd n the issue before the House, and whether it wasm
order for the member fiom Massachusetts (Mr Adams) to
chaise him with the crime of murder, and with being siamed
withmnocent blood] A chaige made by a man who had—and
he appealed to the member  who were present at the time to
confirm the statement—defended him (Mr W ) from the charge
on the floor at the time and not upon any technical gi ounda,
butvpoti the mettls of hu> case and conduct And who had,
as he (Mr W ) was informed by one of his {.Mr A's) own col-
leagues dtftuded him and the part he took in that affair before
thousands of people m Md^jchuse'fs, m piimary assemblage,
and who pledg d himself to he truth of Ins deience, and yet
who has since, from pers mal ícvenge for subsequent causes of
hostility to him (Mr W ) again ¿nd again, no less than three
times falsified his own defence, and leiterated this charge 00
this floor' Mr W said h<  had never escaped fiom trial m the
caseiffeireá to So Jar from it, ha had even earnestly sought a
trial fiom the House which airaigntd him, and he was most un-
lustly refused and denied atrial lie was willing now tobe
tried—to go m Maryland and be tried—to be tried here or any
wheieby a fair and lmfaitial tribunal
And he would now, for the fiist time, solemnly declare that
he was not íesponnble ioi any thing whicn otcurred in the
duel, extept whatoccurieu on the ground—to guard the life of
a friend And this he was at any time leady to prove when-
ever the fact was kgitnna'ely questioned or tested And now
he pionounced thechaige mat e by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts as bate ai d black a Ue as the traitor was hlackand
liase win  mteied H
Mr ADAM& wa  undet-tood to deny that he had ever justifi-

Mr WW rereau d he had been told bo by one of the gen-
tlemtn'sown rolleigues
Mi ADA"\IC3 I say I nevi hd defend the m n on the
menu of the ca e, and I oevti did bt heve but what he was the
guilty man, and that the man who pulled the tnggei was but
an msci ument m his hands 1 his was my behel m the begin-
ning And now he may go t) his Democratic fnenda from ihe
North, to whom he has p ud such tributes oi applause, and we
v. ill see how they voted thioughout the whole of that proceed'
mg—to say nothing of the aiticlein the ^Democratic Review,
which I suppose the Speaker saw published at Lhat time That
Review is known to have been the publication of the Democracy
of this Union, and there was an amele mit at that time which
would show what were ti e opinions and leehngs of the Demo-
