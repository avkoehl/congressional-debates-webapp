me to hope that you will order Dr. C. E. Worrell to my immediate assistance.

Prominent citizens are urging me to employ cannon, and I am more than ever satisfied of the necessity of its use. The enemy is now driven from our waters, and I wish to attack him on land in counties east of Chowan River, but, as suggested before, unless our crossing be protected by artillery, a single boat could cut off our retreat. If you will let me have the use of Woodbury Wheeler`s artillery for a short while, and I do not render you a good account, I will trouble you no more.

Until my occupation of this region, there was a large contraband trade in tobacco and other articles, carried on across the Upper Chowan.

In the absence of any instructions from you, may I ask your wishes at an early date?

Persons of suspicious character occasionally cross the river. These I have prevented without waiting your instructions, but would prefer a plain expression of your views.

I am, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. J. WHEELER,

Commanding Twelfth North Carolina Battalion.

P. S. -May I ask the immediate attention of Major-General Hill to the inclosed charges* against Captain Haggard?
