sentative of the people thus provenly calumni- I]
ated, or to attempt to even modify the record |
upon which I appeal for your verdict against |
the systematic and all-embracing injustice of a \
most shameless registration! May I not suc-
cessfully submit to the House whether such a
neglect to avail himself in this respect of the
additional "sixty days ""you gave him is cura-
ble or even excusable in the too charitable pre-
sumption of the committee as to what he might
have done but did not do ; or by such of his
cross-examinations as prove that my political
status does not accord with that of a majority
of the tribunal before whom I have brought my
case as judges, not as partisans.
I might quote still further corroborations of
the effect of the systematic and well nigh mad-
dening perversions of an oath which, whether
purposely ambiguous or not, (so that its prac-
tical construction might be' either plastic or
stubborn, according to the interest and the
" purpose " of the party who had it all in their
own hands,) I have abundantly proven was mis-
construed and misadministered. As denoted
elsewhere I might still further enforce and am-
plify this position by reading and remarking
upon the testimony of Lyons and Hughes, of
Whittington and the Clays, in my own county,
and upon thatof Brand, Myers, Hale, Standley,
"Williams, Winfrey, Sandid"ge, Norton, Lewis,
Wilson, Roberts, Fisher, O'Nan, Adkins, Moss,
Hallisey, and Garner in other counties; but
permit it to suffice, in recognition of your long-
taxed patience, that as the testimony from my j
own county contains not even an insinuation to [
the disparagement of the practical loyalty of its J
rejected voters, and as we are tacitly trying this 1
case on the testimony from that county alone—
not so strongin some respects as the testimony
from other counties, but conceded to be (as
suggested by the committee) a fair or average j
"specimen of the evidence relied on"—we
will pass at, length to the legal propositions ]
which I so deferentially, yet earnestly propose I
to contest with the committee. j
That being perhaps the only contest between
ns in the view of the case now under considera-
tion, it may be conceded to the erudite and
distinguished ^author of the report that my less
astute judgment might probably have con-
curred with his, had the case in Controversy
been necessarily determinable upon the tech-
nicalities of the books, instead of the satisfied
conscience and judgment of the House. My |
convictions, however, are quite as earnest as i
his can be, that I have brought before you the
consideration of a record from which your !
judgment ought to be satisfied that the election '
here in contest was not the " free and fair" one i
for which we have a constitutional guarantee— i
and upon which, indeed, depends whatever
else is just, or free, or fair—and that it should
not therefore be recognized and upheld upon
technicalities which I sought to avoid, but
could not.
The reasons assigned by the committee for
not even vacating the seat in contest are set
forth in the concluding paragraphs of their
report as follows:
" If the class of evidence introduced by the con-
testant had been the only means within his reach to
establish the right of the persons rejected to be regis-
tered and vote as qualified voters, there would be
very plausible ground to claim that enough ought
to be presumed Irom it to at least vacate the elec-
tion. unless what is proved by the contestant was
rebutted by evidence from the other side. But the
contestant was not confined to thisproof.or evidence
of this general nature .at all. The provisions of the
constitution and laws' of Missouri furnished him
peculiar facilities to establish his case, if he relied
upon proving that legal voters were excluded from
registration and voting as qualified voters, inasmuch
as the rejected list of the registers and the rejected
votes furnished the names of the persons and the
candidates for whom they voted.
"Under these circumstances, the committee con-
sider they have no right to rely upon such vague and
general evidence as has been furnished, or to draw
presumptions and conclusions from it, when it was
clearly within the power of the contestant to have
established the facts he asks us to presume by clear
and exact proof, if such facts exist.
"The committee consider, also, that in order to
unseat a member of this House who has the regular
certificate of election, and who is conceded to have
received a majority of several hundred votes of the
votes received and counted, they should be able
to report whose votes wero excluded that ought to
have been counted; that it would not do for the
committee or for the House to say that out of twenty-
five hundred rejected voters, all of whose names are
unknown, they are satisfied that enough were legal
voters and ought to havo been counted to give the
contestant a majority."
As I would fain escape even the implication
of censure for having in any sense trifled with
the patience of the House in having brought
to its consideration a contest upon evidence
less specific than it was reasonably in my power
to obtain—and which, it may be added, I had
precedent official reason to believe would be
deemed sufficient to at least vacate this elec-
tion—it is trusted I may be borne with a little
longer whilst essaying to vindicate or excuse
myself in this regard. Before doing this, how-
ever, it may be permissible to remark that
I was aware, from the commencement, that
if "the best evidence" in such a case was
required of me, it would involve, first, the
official comparison of the ballots with the cor-
responding numbers on the poll-books, and
that then, after proving by exemplifications of
the registry lists that the persons whose names
were found to correspond with the numbers on
the ballots which had been cast for me had been
duly registered, to have proceeded to prove by
competent parol testimony, after proper notice
as to each individual, that each of them (or at
least enough of them, one by one, to have
changed the result of the election) had been
illegally rejected as a voter.
As to the additional labor and expense of all
this, of which the lawyers of the House will be
the most competent to form a reasonable prox-
imate estimate, they will doubtless concur with
me that it ought not to be imposed upon a con-
testant unless absolutely necessary to the intel-
ligent and upright decision of his contest—a
contest which, in analogy to the laws of Mis-
souri, should be proceeded with and decided
"without the form of pleading." What with
the foundation expenses of comparisons, copies
and certificates at the clerks' offices, and the
subsequent expenses of summoning and exam-
ining proper witnesses as to the loyalty of each
particular name or person whose vote had been
rejected despite his own solemn "oath of loy-
alty," a very moderate estimate of the mileage
and attendance fees of witnesses, day after
day, and of the additional lawyers who would
have necessarily to be employed to look into
and conduct these tedious examinations in con-
nection with the judges and clerks before whom
they were made and reduced to writing, would
carry the figures to an aggregate so absolutely
enormous as of itself to denote the hardship
of the rule suggested by the committee; and
when to this consideration there will be added
from the testimony that the official partisans
of the contestee, whose so-called elections were
in the same process of contest with his own,
would not permit me to obtain "the best tes-
timony" in cases where the ballots had to be
resorted to, surely the record I have made
before you, and which assails and vitiates the
registration of the district as a whole, may be
regarded as at least sufficient to " vacate the
election" which was held under it.
Turning to that branch of the testimony, it
will be seen by the depositions of Livingston,
Essig, and Funkhouser, on pages 6, 10, 13,
and 14, that on the 5th of February last (which
was as soon under the return law of my State
and your notice law as I could) I made formal
application to the court of my county to make
an order which would enable me to have a
recount of the ballots which were cast respect-
ively for the contestee and myself, and that
my application was officially overruled, in con-
formity with the construction (no matter how
absurd or simulated) which the presiding jus-
tice announced as to the law of the State, in
contravention of the design of the law of Con-
gress.
The testimony will further show that I there-
upon publicly requested either of the judges
then upon the bench to consent to take my
depositions for me, and to issue the necessary
suhpama duces tecum to their clerk (under the
Federal law) to produce the ballot-boxes,
registry lists, and poll-books, from which to be
able to lix and depose to the number of rejected
voters, as_ well as the number of accepted
voters, which had been cast for the contestee
and myself in my own township, where there
had been no certificate attached to the poll-
books as to whom the rejected votes had been
given, and where I had reason to believe that I
> had been most grossly swindled in the cast or
count of the accepted vote; and that this, too,
was unanimously refused me by a bench who
claimed to have been elected on the same
ticket, and consequently to hold and exercise
their office on the same tenure with the con-
testee.  
As nearly all the counties in the district were
officered de facto as my own was, and as the
! judge of the circuit was understood to be
absent at the capitol, whereby even the uncer-
; tain remedy of mandamus could not be made
available to me in time to have my case prop-
erly prepared and presented within the limit
! enacted by your law, I had necessarily to yield
< to official misrulings and discourtesies which I
1 could not control, and to compromise (so to
j speak) for such testimony as I could get, and
; as I could get it. I had given notice to take
! these depositions before one of those county
judges, at the county clerk's office, but the
judge refused to serve me, and the clerk refused
my attorney even the use of his office. The
taking had hence to be properly adjourned to
another place, before two justices of the peace,
before whom thfs clerk (who was also elected
on the contestee's ticket) was summoned as a
witness ; and who, in answer to the question,
"Why did you not count the ballots of Concord
township?" replied:
" Simply because there was no official order mada
by the county court for me to do so, without which I
had no authority to do so under the law."
It will be seen by the report of the commit-
tee (page 5) that although this clerk swears he
"was personally acquainted with nearly all the
registered voters on the rejected list of that
township, and with their politics, and that his
opinion and belief was that they all voted for
me," they were nevertheless not included in
the number set down to me in the report as
my rejected aggregate in that county. So also
of two other townships in La Fayette county,
(and it may be added of one of the largest vot-
ing districts in Platte county,) which demon-
strates that the committee was at least to that
extent mistaken in assuming that the "re-
jected lists of the registers, and the rejected
votes, furnished the naifies of the candidates
for whom they voted." Whatever may be
thought, therefore, of the rule they have sug-
gested as to "names," when applied to a con-
testant's claim himself to fill the seat of a sit-
ting member, it is deferentially submitted that
it would be neither judicious nor equitable to
apply it to the vacation of a seat where (as is
relied upon in this case) there is other and
quite sufficient testimony to satisfy the House
that it should be vacated.
The distinction in the two cases is so appa-
rent to my own understanding—it was indeed
so reluctantly forced upon my understanding
when the ordinsft-y facilities of the law were
denied to me at the first practical commence-
ment of this controversy—that I may be par-
doned the reiteration, (if such it be,) that in
thus again referring to this portion of the report
of the committee,-in connection with the record
and the testimony, it is designed simply to
demonstrate that, however proper its judgment
may have been in declining^ to count votes in
my favor which I was denied the right of iden-
tifying by the ballots, as the only preserved or
written testimony—and could hence only do
so upon testimony of a "class" or character
less certain or exact—it world seem impermis-
sibly inequitable aud unforecasting to refuse to
consider oven such testimony (much less the
"array" of more specific testimony I have
here presented) as a basis upon which at least
to vacate this election.
As a practical condensation of this point it
