Number 86. Reports of Brigadier General John C. Moore, c. S. army, coming Brigade. Headquarters MOORE'S BRIGADE, May 21, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report the following casualties in my command during the day: Killed, 6 ; wounded, 12.

I had four guns disabled by the enemy's artillery, viz: One 18-pounder one James, rifled; one Napoleon, 12-pounder and one Parrot, 10-pounder. I hope to be able to have the two first mentioned and, perhaps, the Napoleon gun in working order by to-morrow morning. The enemy's has been exceedingly galling during the day; in some instances their shots passed entirely through the parapets, killing and wounding men on the inside. They have been able to concentrate the fire of three batteries, at widely distant points, on the same work. One of the most important works on ly line has been without a gun in working condition since about 10. 30 a. m.

The enemy had indicated no design of assaulting in my front during the day. Yesterday troops were massed and moved forward a short distance, but seemed deterred by a few well-directed shots. I fear the move has been deferred indefinitely.

Very respectfully,

JNumber C. MOORE,

Brigadier-General.

The enemy occupies with his artillery a position with extended works as strong as ours. He has thrown up works for some twenty or twenty five guns, all bearing on my right. Many of his guns are of much heavier caliber than
