repeated assurances from different parties that you had prohibited his agents in the purchase of supplies; that Port Hudson depends almost entirely for supplies on the other side of the river. Further, that he has ever thought and is glad to hear that you are willing to assist him, as he is also to assist you when able.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. C. TAYLOR,

Aide-de-Camp.

* * * * * * * * * * * * I found a large quantity of corn on the levee, notwithstanding there had been no arrival previous to the Trent for three or four days. I also noticed on the levee, within a few feet of the water, the 410 barrels of salt which was discharged there more than a month since. I saw many soldiers shelling corn about the landing merely to obtain the cobs to throw at one another. Others were filling their haversacks with shelled corn and corn in the ear. * * * Captain Woods stated that he had seen a large quantity of the bulk pork remain in the rain on the levee for a week, and half the lot was spoiled and unfit for use. * * * Mr. Macauley told me that 25,000 bushels of corn were submerged on the levee at Port Hudson, and several parties stated that more subsistence had been wasted than consumed.

Major R. W. MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

* * * * * * * * * * I am informed by Mr. F. D. Conrad, a gentleman of unimpeachable credit, that about the time when the gunboat Queen of the WEST was

captured by our forces, there was a large quantity of corn upon the

banks of the river at Port Hudson, which remained unstored for eight or ten days. At the expiration of this time it was removed from the landing and stored in a damaged condition. * * *

Major and Chief of Subsistence.

P. S. - Captain J. V. Duvalde, of the parish of WEST Baton Rouge, was

in my office when Mr. Conrad made his statement, and said either

that he had heard of or had himself seen the condition of commissary stores at Port Hudson stated by Mr. Conrad as existing.
