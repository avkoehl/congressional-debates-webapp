SANDY HOOK, February 27-1 p. m.

General R. B. MARCY:

Do not send the regular infantry until further orders. Give Hooker orders not to move until further orders.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN.

SANDY HOOK, February 27, 1862-3.30 p .m.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

The difficulties here are so great that the order for Keyes' movement must be countermanded until the railway bridge is finished or some more permanent arrangement made. It is impossible to supply a large force here. Please inform Garrett at once.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SANDY HOOK, February 27, 1862-3.30 p .m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The lift-lock is too small to permit the canal-boats to enter the river, so that it is impossible to construct the permanent bridge, as I intended. I shall probably be obliged to fall back upon the safe and slow plan of merely covering the reconstruction of the railroad. This will be done at once, but will be tedious. I cannot, as things new are, be sure of my supplies for the force necessary to seize Winchester, which is probably re-enforced from Manassas. The wiser plan is to rebuild the railroad brigade as rapidly as possible, and then act according to the state of affairs.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

General McCLELLAN:

If the lift-lock is not big enough why cannot it be made big enough? Please answer immediately.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

SANDY HOOK, February 27-10.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

.

It can be enlarged, but entire masonry must be destroyed and rebuilt, and new gates made; an operation impossible in the present stage of water and requiring many weeks before this could be done.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

SANDY HOOK, February 27, 1862.

General MARCY:

Revoke Hooker's authority, in accordance with Barnard's opinion. Immediately on my return we will take the other plan, and push on vigorously.
