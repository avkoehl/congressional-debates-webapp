SIR: Major-General Smith directs me to say that he will not get all his command off from this place until very late to-day.

He desires that you hold the enemy in check as long as possible, as the safety of his command depends upon it. Colonel Morgan will be sent to your assistance as soon as he can be brought up from the rear.
