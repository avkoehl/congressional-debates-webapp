Colonel J. W. SHAFFER:

Colonel Biggs telegraphs to send all tugs, steamers, &amp;c., to him that I can possibly spare. Shall I reserve any transportation here for emergency, or shall I send down everything but the dispatch boats? General Butler asked for a list of transportation day before yesterday. Will he require any soon? Please answer, as I an detaining some steamers came recently with troops I hear from you.

C. E. FULLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Quartermasters.

BERMUDA, June 12, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER

Chief of Staff:

The One hundred and thirty-third Ohio, 100-days' men, and First Maryland Cavalry, dismounted, are here on steamers Winona and Guide. Shall they be sent to Point of Rocks for disembarkation?

The Guide. I am afraid, draws too much water to go up, and I should heisted to send her unless absolutely necessary. She has the First Maryland, and they have but little baggage. Can't they march?

GEO. S. DODGE,

Captain and Quartermaster.

I have sent the Rebeca Burton up the Appomattox River to discharge; the steamer Andrew Hurder has just reported with the One hundred and thirty-second Ohio, Colonel Haines. The steamer draws too much water to go to Point of Rocks. Shall I discharge them here?
