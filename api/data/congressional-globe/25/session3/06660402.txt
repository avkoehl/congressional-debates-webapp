Ho. of Reps.
November, 1838, long after his neglect to forward the ac-
count is due time had been reported by tins office fp the
Comptroller It is true, üiat somewhere about August,
1837, on the «xaminauon ofitois account at this office.there
would have appeared to be a large amount of bonds due in
the first quarter ofl837, not returned as paid or pot in suit,
and the collector would; have been called upon far in ex
planation Under all the circumstances of this dase, he
might have, and no doubt would have, replied to such an
inquiry, that these bonds liad been extended UBder the au
thorny of the Secretary of (he Treasury and the act of Con
gress, but that, owing to the greit mass of such bonds,
amounting, it is believed, to more than five million dollars,
and to the great confusion into which the bonds bad been
thrown, increased, too, by the fact, not then known to the
accounting officers of (he custom house, that the collector
had actually collected a large amount of said bonds, be
could not, at least for a considerable- time, render any par
ticular account of them Such a reply would have been
considered, at teast for the time being, as satisfactory, cer
tainly it would not have excited any suspicion at the Treas-
ury, because all the bonds referred to were actually entitled
to the extension provided for by Congress, and would natur-
ally bave been supposed to have been so extended
Having, as I presume, thus clearly shown that this oflice
had no means of ascertaining tin* defalcation, when it
" first occurred," nor " at the different settlements after
wards," I proceed to the nextinqmry in your letter, which
is in the following words "If, under the present system of
adjusting the accounts of the collectors, it be impracticable
to ascertain defaults like these immediately after ihey occui,
I will thank you to report to mejsuch modifications and im
provements as may suggest themselves to you, in order that
«II defalcations Jiereafter may be nnmediarely known, i(
possible and m case that you should consider that further
legislation may be necessary to attai u this object, I wish yon
to point out the defects that should be provided foi, arid also
such additional checks that might be imposed to prevent
the embezzlementof the public funds by the collectors and
receivers of the public revenue "
If may not be improper to state here that by the fifth sec
«Ion of tho act of the Jid of September, 1789, " to establish
theTreasury Department," and the fourth section of the act
*' to provide for the prompt settlementol public accounts,"
approved the 3d of March, 1817, the duties of the JTirst
Auditor are denned as follows "lo receive all accounts
accruing in (he Treasury Department, and, after examina
turn, to certify tin balance and transmit the accounts, with
the vouchers and ceitificate, to the Tirst Comptroller, for
his decision thereon " Now, if the " modifications and im
provements " caUed for by the Secretary be confined to this
office only, there are but two suggestions which occur to me
at this lime, as all that arc necessary, and steps have al
leady been taken to carry them into effect The first is that
Hie collectors be required to render an account 01 all the
outstanding bonds, showing their actual condition on the
30th of September, 1838, and that hereafter, instead of re
cording the bonds in this office, the bond uccounts, as soon
as rcceivcd,are to bo compared wiih the preceding original
accounts, and till the bonds paid or put in suit (luring the
quarter forthwith marked so tint the actual state ol the
bonds will alwavs bt exhibited simull meous w ith the report
oh the account of tin customs The other suggestion i*,
that the collector of New York return with his qn irterly
accoumot thetustoms,ncopyofhis " suspense accounts,"
showing what items compose that past of the balance not
consisting of bonds or cash on hand, so that in slating the
items ol the bnlanci at the Treasury, tins olhce may be nble
to designate what is actually ca^h on h uid from that which
consists ol unscttli d and si^pen^e n< counts
Jim as this request ol the feecretaiy embraces a pretty
wide rungo, I may, with propriety, be permittfd, m my re
Íily, respectfully tasuggist some other " modifications and
mproveinents," although, in doing so I may be trenching
upon the prerogatives of others It appears, fioni the in
vestigation recently made at tho custom house, N«w York,
that on the debit sido of their " su^pcn&e account ' is found
an item called "duties on merchandise," which means
"cash deposits for duties not ascertained," aud this, ac
cording to tin ir mode of k( (ping the accounts, has never
been regarded as cash until the duties are actually ascer
tained and settled, at some future day, with the merchant,
but retained in the suspense account, and returned by the
collector lo ihe 1reasury,in his balance, as belonging to
unsettled and suspense accounts I Ins practice placed at
the disposal of the collector a sum vaiymg from one hun-
dred thousand to five hundred thousand dollars, not avail
able at the 1 reasury, or not regarded or returned as cash,
although such de facto, upon which the collector might
draw from time to time for his private purposes, without
any check upon him, even in the office of the Secretary
himself, and it appeared, on the recent investigation,
that it was this fund which first tempted the late collector
of New York , and it wa=i only when this source was ex
hausted and the peculiar occasion referred to presented
itself, that he seized upon the bonds How it has hap
iened thai at New York these deposits for duties are not
regarded as cash, and al Philadelphia they are, and very
properly, too, accounted for aa sueh, this office has no
means or ascertaining, having no control whatever over
the internal regulations of the custom house, but such is
the fact    The remedy is obvious
Again the naval officer has alwavs been regarded, not
only as an aid to the collector, but an important check upon
him The twenty first section of the " act to regulate the
collection of duties on imports and tonnage" requires him,
nmong other things, " to examine the collector's abstracts
of duties, and other accounts of receipts, bonds, and ex
penditures, and, if found right, he shall certify the same "
It is to be apprehended that the naval officer at New York
has not, under this requism m, considered it to be his duty
to examine the cash and bank accounts, and although he
has certified the bond accounts of 1837 " to have been ex-
amined and found to be correct," the fact is now apparent
that they were not correct Had tins officer performed his
whole duty, this defalcation must have been discovered
sooner Í would, moreover, respectfully suggest that an
examination be made of the concerns of the custom hou«e
occasionally, bv an agent, as is the practice, I Understand,
in reference to land office", which would greatly facilitate
the discovery of malpractices where they exist, and enable
the proper authority to apply the corrective These " im
provements," m addition to the weekly and monthly returns
of moneys received and paid at the custom house," the
' return of dcbentuie ," 'abstracts, of bonds put in suit,"
" summary statement of duties collected," "schedule of
bonds taken and liquidated," &c , required for the Secreta
ry's office, agreeably to ancient regulations and usages of
the Treasury Department, as embodied in the circular of
feecretary of the Treasury, dated November IS, 1835, if
properly arranged and compared with each other, and with
the quarterly account current of the customs, also formerly
entered on the Secretary's books as soon as received at the
office of the Fir>£ Auditor, would, it is believed, furnish rhe
Secretary the means of ascertaining defaults like these im
mediately after they occur

A MAHON, C C
To the Hon Levi WooDBOXit, Secretary of the Treasury
From this report, sir, we Jearn—
1    That one reason for not detecting this de-
falcation is, that the Secretary extended the time
to the collector at New York for making up and
rendering his accounts for adjustment
2   The accounting clerks in the Fust Auditor's
office have not been made, since 1829, to ascertain
that the balance of the bond account of the col-
lector was correctly brought forward, that the ad
dilions were correct, and the balance, as retained,
properly stated
3    Bonds from New York have not been re-
corded    Never in time to accompany accounts of
the Comptroller   This duty has been wholly neg
lected during Mr Woodbury's term of office, since
the second quarter of 1834
4   The account of Swai twout was not received
at the office of the Fust Auditor until the 10th of
November, 1838, long after lus neglect to forward
the account in due time had been reported to the
Comptrollei
5    That the collector had not been requned to
render an account of all outstanding bonds
6   That the collector at New York had not been
required to return, with his quarttily account of
the customs, a copy of his " suspense accounts,"
showing what items compose that part of the
balance not consisting of bonds or cash on hand
7    That deposits foi duties have not been íe
garded as cask at New York, whilst at Philadel-
phia they have been so regarded—and the Secie
taiy himself had contiol of this—unaccountable
to Auditor, but the "temedy obvious "
8    The naval officer has not been made to do
his duty, and, if he had done his whole duty, this
defalcation Could not have occurred
9    That the " weekly and monthly returns of
moneys received and paid at the custom house," the
" leturn of deientwes," " abstracts of bonds put in
sutf," " summary statement of duties collected,"
" schedule of bonds taken and liquidated," íe-
quired for the Sea etaiy's office have not been prop-
el ly ananged and computed with each other and
with the quaUei ly account current of the customs by
the Seci eiai y of the 2"? easury himself
Such, sir, is the expose by this able and mas-
teily and independent repoit of the ability and m
tegnly with which your Treasury Department
has been conducted, and by which this million of
public money has been abstracted' Sir, this re-
port must have been gall and wormwood to
Woodbury I understand that the manly clerk
by whom it was made is already under the ban
of his displeasure It is a biting sarcasm, it is a
sneer throughout, upon Mr Secretary's unblush-
ing effionteiy in lus trnjuwy into the causes of this
defalcation He knew above all men, how it hap-
pened Sir, if ever a Whig President be elected,
and I have a tittle of influence with his councils,
this man Mahon shall be remembered by me as
a firm and faithful public servant I know him
not, but this report is a voucher tome of his char-
acter But, sir, I forget' I am doing a good and
true man an injury by daring here aloud to com
mend Tiis worth It may remove him Oh' the
tyianny of proscription ' This man lets the cat
out of the bag—he tells you that the meal tiay
was left uncovered—wholly neglected, and the
rats have been permitted, at will, to go in and
come out with full license from the Secretary It
shows that every check has been abandoned and
neglected by the Secretary—the naval officer—the
Comptroller—not to say by the First Auditor
Sir, if party spuit, like a ftend, did not befriend
and sustain this Secretary—pardon and white-
washes hideous deformities and delinquencies—
blight all moral sensibility here in this Hall and
at the "White-house, he would be lemoved from
office instantly, or be impeached Go where Voa
will—tiace him anywhere, and you will find him
dull, stupid, incompetent, neglectful, faithless,
and corrupt I mince no terms'—fear no respon-
sibilities If he. had the sensibilizes of a man, he
would demand a" trial Give me an honest jury,
and I will, upon these papers, convict him '
Sir, the report of the First Comptroller confirma
the report of the Fust Auditor'
"Jp relation to that portion of your communication of tho
19th instant, in which you request the suggestions of this
office as to the modifications and improvelnents that may
be necessary in the present system-of adjusting theaccounts
of collectors, or as to the further legislation requisite to pre-
vent or immediately detect future defalcations, I beg leave
to refer you to the joint report of the Solicitor of the Treas
nry and myself, dated at New York, the 15th ultimo, for my
views as to the principal defects of the present system, and
their remedies by legislation
1 Until efficient alterations, however, shall be made by
law in the system of collecting guarding and accounting fur
the public moneys received by collectors of the customs,
the principal check on embezzlement must, in the custom'
house, be sought in the integrity and vigilance of the naval
officer 1 he duties of this officer are highly responsible and
important, and cannot fail, if properly performed, to aid ma
terially in the pievention or detection of frauds The law
declares that ' the naval officer shall receive copies of all
manifests and entries, and shall, together with the collector,
estimate the duties on all goods, wares, and merchandise,
subject to duty, (and no duties shall be received without
such estimate,) and shall keep a separate record thereof,
and shall countersign all permits, clearances, certificates,
debentuies and other documents to he granted by the col
lectin , lie fchall also exánime the collector's abstracts of
dunes and other accounts of receipts, bonds, and expendí
tures, and if lound right, he shall certify the same '
*' In the 1 reasury Department, much, also, it is conceived,
might be done towards the prevention ol the recurrence ol
defalcations like that in question In the office of the First
Auditor, it is understood that some years since a record was
kept of all duty bonds taken, a thorough examination of
which, in every rendition of the quarterly abstract of bonds
liquid ited and bonds in suit, could scarcely fail to lead to
the detect on of any attempt at Iraud in withholding the
amount of any one of the bonds recorded This branch of
the !-ubjeci however, it is presumed will be more satisfac
tonly discussed m the report of the First Auditor, to whom
It mort pioperly appertains
"The ab tiaction of the amounts paid on bonds neve?
retume 1 as liquidated lorms about one half of the entire
dedication of the late collector at Sew York Of the other
moiety, the two principal items are cash herd on deposit to
meet unascertained duties, and cash retained ostensibly to
refund duties paid under protest
" In connection with the abstraction of those sums, as
well as of those paid on bonds, I would observe that, until
a few years past, the account current received at the office
of the First Auditor, with the quartet y accounts of col
lectors, were called for and compared, in the office of tho
Secretary of the 1 reasury, with a record there kept, and
with the several returns rendered to the Secretary, m con
formity with the requisitions of his circular dated the 14th
of October, 1818, and repeated on the 14th of November,
1835
" The list of returns thus rendered, embraced the follow
ing A weekly return of moneys received and paid, a
monthly return of debentures paid, a monthly abstract of
bonds put m suit during the month , a monthly summary
statement of duties collected, a monthly schedule of bonds
taken and liquidated during the month, and a quarterly re
turn of the moneys received and paid under the acts for the
relief of sick and disabled seamen
" J hose examinations and comparisons would, it is con
ceived, be greatly useful, and especially when it is con*
sidered that the returns thus rendered to the Secretary,
weekly and monthly, are the onlv returns of the kind
received by the Department within or during a curreirt
quarter
" Should it be deemed proper to revive the practice, it is
suggested to obviate the inconvenience and delay in the
office of the First Auditor attending the use, in the office of
the Secretary, of the account current, that the collectors
furnish those documents in duplicate
" I have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your obe-
dient servant,                                     J  N   BARKER
" Hon Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury "
Now, sir, be it remembered that this Admin-
istration and the preceding are both alike distin-
guished for the doctrine that the Executive was
a unit—" that it was the Presidentas dutu to take care
that the laws be faithfully executed " Why has not
this duty, so strenuously insisted on with the
view of maintaining Executive prerogative, been
perfoimed in discharge of Executive obligation
and responsibility >
I am now done with the review of these cases
And, after what I have laid before you, let me
ask—" What use would there be in humbling our-
selves to become spies and censors to report defalcations
and crimes to this Executive, with a view to a prompt
