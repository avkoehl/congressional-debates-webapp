mind a sufficient justification for your request. The attempt to which you refer, to have you removed, was not officially known to me, and, as rumored, involved many others, some of whom were not removed and none, so far as I was concerned, for that specific reason. The withdrawal of Lieutenant-General Hill from the command of a corps without ability to assign him to another corps prevented his nomination to the Senate for that grade, and consequently left him in the grade to which he had been confirmed. The law permitted no other result.

MARIETTA, June 12, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Fearing that a previous telegram on the subject may not have reached you, I respectfully again recommend the promotion of Brigadier-General Walthall to command the division of Lieutenant-General Polk's troops now under Brigadier-General Cantey. General Polk regards this promotion as important as I do.

General JOHNSTON,

Marietta:

General S. D. Lee was directed about two weeks since to operate as you suggest, and was on the move when he was recalled by a heavy movement of the enemy in his department from Memphis. As soon as he shall have disposed of that, your suggestion will have attention. All is quiet in our front and rear, but in the Valley we are sustaining some serious devastations.*

General.
