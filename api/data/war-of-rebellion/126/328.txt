Two hundred and sixteen inspection reports rendered by officers of the Quartermaster's Department, under orders of the Quartermaster-General, have been entered in the inspection division during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865. Many of these reports contain 240 pages of foolscap paper. All of them have been thoroughly and carefully examined and extracts made and sent to the several division to which they had reference.

There have been received and rendered in the inspection division during the same time 579 communications referring to inspection investigations and the official character of officers of the Quartermaster's Department.

The entries in the inspection book are in fact briefs of the original papers, and not merely skeletons. Every name of a person, however insignificant, occurring in these papers is alphabetically entered, so that one name being recollected, all the facts pertaining to the transaction can be at once ascertained.

INVESTIGATIONS.

Investigations involving the conduct of officers have generally been conducted by officers of this department with great thoroughness and efficiency, but some mistakes have been made, in the mode of investigating by a want of shrewdness and propriety of action.

It was intended to give a summary of the recommendations by the several officers assigned to inspection duty for reductions, and the amount saved to the Government by these inspections; but my protracted absence and the little time now left precludes the possibility of carrying out this design.
