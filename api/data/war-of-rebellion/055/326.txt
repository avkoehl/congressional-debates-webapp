CONFIDENTIAL.] HDQRS. ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS,

Lookout Valley, Tennessee, November 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General GEARY,

Commanding Division, Twelfth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you hold one-half of your command in readiness to occupy that part of our line now held by the Eleventh Corps, and that the latter be relieved as soon after dark to-night as practicable. He recommends that you send the necessary staff officers along the line to-day, in order to examine it and see how the pickets are stationed, so that the charge may be made without delay or confusion. The general considers this part of the line more exposed than the part on which your division is established, and he requests that your disposition be made accordingly.

Very respectfully

Lieutenant, Aide-de-Camp, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
