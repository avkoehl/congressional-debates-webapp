pies who consume ihe veiy beemning, o accumulation H~

dustry The ability of Rothschild himseli is, under such ui
cumstances, wholly unavailing All his ambition finally ctu
tres in one only aim, and that is, to feed and clothe the wife of
hisbosom and the childien of his loins
In a moral point of view the passage of this bill is vastly
impoitant Nothing m all the vicissitudes of life so tries the
principles of men, as loss of property, and the pel petual slavery
of debt These are among the most resistirá tempta'iois to
frauds Men whose pnnciples of honesty and sense of moial
obligation have withstood the pleasure of reproach, sickness,
detraction, disappointed ambition, and family bereavement,
have yielded to the stern and cruel poviei oí insolvent hope
lessness The obligation to sustain a family, and the conscious
neaa that no honest effort can ever bung relief, justify, in their
view, resorts at which the r souls, under better cirrum tances,
revolts By little and by little the moral tone is lelaxed—con
science is silenced amid the clamois of want and the man be
comes a villain * Hence the low shifts and concealit ents—
hsnee, sometimes the peijunes and foigenes ofsomeof those
who fail Yet not all For many stand sublimely pine through
life, and though they endure the heat of the furnace, they are
but .efined by the piot,e«s of burning Some, however, be
comebutasdioss Now, sir, I ask, who clothes the Govern
rnent with the right to demoralize the ppople 7 Whit right have
we to force men into guilt? Is it not the requirement of Chris
tianity as well as of the I onstituuon, that we should airest this
process of demoralisation? W© can do it by providing the
means of escape from the pnson house of del t
The bill recognises two gieat principle  town mvoluntaiy
bankruptcy, m lavoi of creditor, against debtors, who are mei
chantSjtraclers faetois banters brokers un lerwnteis, or marine
insurers, and voluntary bankruptcy, conceded as a privilege oi
Tight to be exercised by all other citizens, at their pleasure
The volumaiy leature has i ow, tor Ihe fust time, I believe, in
the history of legislation on thissubject been mcoipoiatetl into

TheouginalbilIintrod_"edby Mr Wrbs, ei in'o the Senate,
,v rh has evidently lormed the basis of this wa> cons  ste it in
its provisions if not perfect m us details I have undeistool
from veiygiod authority lhalthatblll was the joint pioducnon
of Mr Webster and Judge Story But amendments have been
mroducel in the Senate that have greatly mained its b"auty
and obscured its provisions It is in some respects contradic
tor>, and I think it will be very difficult to cairy it into effect
¡Nevertheless, as it is now conceded on all hands that it i too
lale to attempt to perfect this gieat metsure at th s season
the question presents ifelf whether we will take the bill as it
is, postponing its operation long enough after the commence
ment of the next sesión to enab e us to cnirect any defects at
that tune, or arijouin without any legislation upon this subject
I cannot ho=itate I am for the bill asitla rather than no
thing I take it "with all its impeifections on i's h^ad '
rathei than to have no legislation on the sulject One
gieat point is gained to the friends of this measure by ihe
pa ,age of this bill it at teast ct in pels legislation on this
subject at the next session It is tornea ,unject of deep regret
that our legi=!ation at this time cannot be so perfectas to give
ample and immediate relief to tho e lor whose benefit this bill is
intended But as it cannot, the next best thing is to ensure it
herea'ter
I know that this bill is imperfect, and m vo'mg for it I mean
simply to deciaip that lam m favoi of a baokuipt law, and I
hope every gentleman onthis ilooi who is in favor of tins mea
sure will vote for this bill and trust to the next ses ion 'o per
feet it We must make a begim mg, and those who are loot
in* foi this relief have been tantalized with anucipat on until

ol the kmgc om From its mtroduptio i down to the present
time with the ex-ei tlon of a has y, if not petulant, lemaik of
Lord El Ion m which he s ood alone it has be^n an object of
umveisal favor It formerly only embraced merchants a"d
tradeis, but recen* acts of Parliampnt, called for by public opi
nion, have greatly extended its provisions, and e-ippnence has
abundantly proved that its beneficial influence is apphcab'e to
every c'ass of society
Notonly Gitat Dr tain, but, it is said, every commercial na
tion of the globe, e rcept our ow n under different modifications,
has introduced a system of banki upt laws a nd why should *sns
Government stand behind all otheis in this great work o*1 modern
improvement? Does our fieeConstitu ion forbid this a-vanee
ment m our social condi ion? Ate debtois to be freed from
bondage under the reign of kings and potentates, and kep m
slavery under oui Republican institutions? Our forefathers in
tended no such thing Our Constitution breathes a nobler and
more mote generou spirit The powei is expressly given to
Congiess, and if we fail to exercise it, the fault, the inhumanu-,
and th* failure to come up to the spirit and lmpiovement of the
age will rest on us
The Constitution expressly provides that Congress shall
hive powei to establish - unifoim liws on the subject of bank
runtcies throughout the United States " The power Is- general
and unlimited, except that the laws are to be "uniform,' that
is the> aie to be ihesamem every Sitaie m the Uní i notsub-
jectto particular or local p**ceptio is This clause in the Con*
stitution conferring on Congress this important power, was
viewed with general favor at the time of its adoption It waa
adopted by a vote c f nine Vates agn st one No argument
was leqmred in its favor rhe only clause ccntained m tie
numbers <1 the 'Fedpiahv ' on the subject is f-om the pen of
Mr Madison, and is in these wortis "The powei of estabiish'ug
uniform law} of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with
the regulation of commeice and will prevent so mu y frauds,
where the parties or then propelty miy lie or be removed into
different S a^es, that tnc expedience of it seems not likely tobe
drawn m question '
I his shows ihe light in which the subject was viewed at the
dateol the Cons ltution The expediency of nives mg Cjn
gi ess with this [io vei was then not "drawn in question" It
was regatded as ' intimate y conrccted with the regulation of
commerce," and calculated when brought into exercise, to pre
vent 'many fi amis "
A learned commpntator, in treating of this clause of the Con-
stitution, cavs that 'one of the fir^tduties of legislation, whila
it piovi les amply for the sacred obligations of contracts, and
the leme lies to enforce ihem   certainly is   pal i passu, to ve
heve ine uníortunate and mentorious debtor from a slaveiy of
mini and body, which cuts him off from a fair enjoyment of the
common benefits of society, and rubs his family of the fruits of
his laboi and the bent fits of his paternal superintendence    A
ISational Government which did not possess this power of le-
gislation would be little worthy of the exalted functions of
guarding the happiness an   supporting the tights of a flee peo
pie    It might guar 1 against political opftessions, only to ren
der pnvate oppressims more mtoleiable and more glaung '
The same learned anchor, (Mr  Story,) aPer taking a view of
the practical operation of this policy, an 1 its beneficial influ
eic  on society wherever it has been introduced, expresses his
astonishment and legict that tins subject 1 is bo long been ne
ele ted b> Congiess    lie says    'It cannot but be matter of ie
giet that a power so salu aty shoultl have hittn no remained a
rreie dead letter    It is i xtraordmary that a comme'cial nation,
sprt  ling its en ei prise through the wh ile woi Id  and possess
in" such an infinitely vaued mterral trade, reaching a'mo^t to
every cuttage in the most t istant States, should voluntarily sur
rendei up a system woirh has elsewhere ei joyed such -.eneml
fd'or   as the bestseruu )  of the creditors against fraud, ami
th  best pro ec ion of debtors aganst oppression >
With this view of the subject— ol I s introduction into ev< ly
commerual nation on ihe gloDe except our wn of its beno
fictal infl lene an 1 universal popularity where'er it has been
introduced—o the opinion of the fiamtrs of oui Canstitution

mu y who have heretofote looked into the«ubjeci,lliat Congress
has siloie neglected to excicise thts important constitutional
p iwer? Is this p jwei nevei to be exercised? Is it forever to
remain a mere dead letter in the Constitution? If so, it i- un
