APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

•The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
40th Cong....3d Sess.
these floating bulwarks may dispense with man j
land-anchored forts at home. How can there
be safe commerce where there are not national
ships? We are respected abroad only as our
flag makes itself respected while floating over
oar sailors and their guns. Now, all that we have
left under our destructive congressional legis-
lation is the nursery of our coastwise trade—
a great nUrsery to be sure, stretching, as it does,
thousands of miles from Maiiie to'Texas on the
Atlantic, and from southern California to
Alaska on the Pacific—but no adequate nurs-
ery for the seamen necessary to protect and to
honor a flag which has hitherto flown from the
Arctic to the Antarctic, and which has made
the heart of the American jubilant in every
land, in every quarter of the globe he lived.
Sir, a Congress insensible to these important
facts, or not sensible to the importance of com-
merce, and its protection the world over, for-
gets one of its first duties, if it does not commit
a great national crime. But what has Congress
done, and what greater destruction does this
bill propose V Let us see.
SHIPBUILDING HIiHK—THE COST.
One of the elements of ship building is cop-
per, and this bill doubles or triples the duty on
copper, while it is full, all over, of heavier
and heavier taxation upon iron. The present
taxation on American snips and American ship-
builders is enormous ; but the honorable gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania cries for "more,"
''more." Mr. D. McKay, about the largest
ship-builder in the United States, Fcbruaryl5,
1868, stated, under his own signature, the fol-
lowing to be'the tariff-taxation entering into
the construction of a new ship of one thousand
tons:

AN AMIililOAN SHIP IS AN AMERICAN MANUFACTORY AS
MUCH AS A ROLLING-MILL.
The moment an American ship leaves an
American port it enters upon a free trade—a
free competition with all the nations of the earth.
It is not,like an iron rolling-mill in the interior of
Pennsylvania, protected by the cost of freights
at home and the cordon of custom-houses on
the ocean, (seventy cents per one hundred
pounds,) but it is an American manufactory
launched upon the high seas, stripped of all
protection, and in competition with all the in-
dustry on the earth. It is as much a manufac-
tory as the rolling-mill of Pennsylvania and as
much in competition with the cheap labor of the
world; but Pennsylvania, herself covered all
over with bounties at home, levies upon the
New England or Now York one thousand ton
ship some ten thousand dollars or more in cur-
rency to depress, to burden it in competition
with that outside world. The crying injustice
of this is so far from being felt by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania that, not content with this
enormous levy, he cruelly proposes now to run
up this ten thousand dollar currency tax on the
one thousand ton ship to some twelve thousand
dollars or more, by his increase upon the iron
elements that enter into the composition of the
American ship. Our ship-carpenters are idle,
or working for lower wages in paper than they
hitherto had in gold. Glasgow, Nova Scotia,
and New Brunswick are driving our ships out
of the freighting markets of the world, though
North and South we have the best ship lumber
in the world. Our sympathies are appealed to
for the sufferers of the copper miners of Mich-
igan in order to pass this bill, but not one
word is said by its advocates in behalf of the
greater suffering ship-carpenters of Maine, New
Hampshire, 'Massachusetts, and New York.
We begged, but begged in vain, the last ses-
sion of this Congress to give shipbuilders in
the United States a drawback upon their
$10,000 duties they paid on their one thousand
ton ships; but the honorable gentleman from
Pennsylvania successfully rallied his Pennsyl-
vania cohorts against it, and the maritime
States of this Union, staggering under that
blow, have in despair, at least, given up all
hope, except in their coastwise trade.
THE TARIFF DESTRUCTIVE OF AMERICAN SHIPS.
Sir, the rebel ship Alabama swept our com-
merce from the seas wherever or whenever it
was touched by that fatal crew ; but the Ala-
bama was never so destructive upon American
shipping, and American commerce therein, as
the legislation of this Congress, which the bill
now before us proposes to make worse. Peace
has brought us no restoration of our ships; but.
on the contrary,' the decrease seems to go on
during the peace as during the war, for the
high tariff is as great a curse to commerce as
was the Alabama. When the war began (in
1861) the tonnage of the globe was as follows :
Tonnage
Tons. June 30. '68
Owned by the United States 5,530,813 4,318,309
Groat Britain and dependeneies..5,898,369
All other nations 5,800,767
17,235,949
Of this total the United States owned nearly
one third, Great Britain over one third, and all
other maritime nations the remaining third.
Nearly one third of the international ocean
carrying trade of the civilized world has been
in the hands of our young Republic ; but as
Alabamas killed us during the war tariffs have
killed us since the peace. We had as long ago
as 1855 115,045 tons of foreign steam tonnage.
Now not an American-European steamer, not
one.
l'OKBIGN STEAM TONNAGE, 1867.
Great Britain's estimate 775,000
United States 175,520
Difference 599,480
This difference of nearly six hundred thou-
sand tons is more than the combined conimer-
cial steam tonnage of the United States and
Great Britain five years ago. There are now
eight lines of foreign-built steamers running
from New York owned by foreign capitalists
and protected by the flags of England, France,
and North Germany. Ten steamers are in one
of these lilies, and more on the stocks. The
following table tells a fatal tale:

and barks. schooners.

Snowing that while with schooners our coast-
wise monopoly saves us from foreigners, we
perish when we enter into competition with
them in ships and barks.
"The building of ocean steamers is also in an ex-
ceedingly depressed condition. Daring the year end-
ing June 30,1868, there were but six occan steamers
built in the U lited States, whose aggregate tonnage
amounted to lourteen thousand eight hundred and
fifty-five tons. Nearly all the steamers built in this
country during the last five years have been intended
to meet the demands ot our coastwise tradev
'* The depletion of our forests ot ship timber ren-
ders it probable that within the next ten years we
shall be compelled to resort to iron as a ship-building
material. Tne iron ship-building enterprises which
sprang< up at several points in this country before the
warenjoyed for a while a degree of prosperity which
gave promise of great future success. That interest
is now prostrated.
" During the year ending June 30,1868, there were
but six iron vessels—all steamers—built in the Uni-
ted States, whoseaggregate tonnage amounted to two
thousand eight hundred and one tons, all of which
were built by Messrs. Harlan & Hoihngsworth, of
Wilmington, Delaware, and were designed for river
navigation,
"In order to show our relative inferiority in this
branch of ship-buildina: it may bestatedthatdurmg
the year 1867 there were ninety-nine iron sailing
vessels built in Engl md, Scotland, and Ireland,
whose aggregate tonnage amounted to fifty-nine thou-
sand and thirty-three tons, and two hundred and
twenty-four iron steamers, whose aggregate tonnage
amounted to ninety thousand eight hundred and
twenty-three tons; the iron sailing vessels amount-
ing to thirty-four percent, of the total sailing tonnage
built, and theiron steamers to ninety-six per cent, of
the total steam tonnage built."—Extract from the
official report of Mr. Nimmo to the Secretary of the
Ireasury.
Sir, in view of these facts, how can, how
dare the gentleman from Pennsylvania demand
the doubling or trebling of the duty on copper
and a great increase of the duty on iron ? Has
he no love for the flag? Has he no heart for
the gallant sailor who carries that flag on every
sea ? Has he no pride in American commerce
and American trade? Or is he ceasing to be
an American, and becoming only one of the
Chinese, with their old shut up, shut out policy,
which even they have exploded at last? But
if the honorable gentleman himself is deaf and
dumb to all but his own supposed local inter-
ests; if he cannot look out upon the world
beyond the shops of his own foundries and
forges, I appeal to the people of his State to
remember Decatur, Bainbridge, Hull, Law-
rence, Perry, Farragut, and to remember that
ships and sailors and commerce alone have
raised and can raise such men, and that what
he is doing is destroying them all while it is
exposing our coasts to be a prey to the Norse-
men of the world. A nation without ships is
a nation without arms or legs or hands ; a,
nation within a shell, with its head to be cracked
whenever it thrusts it out. While I respect I
do not mean to decry the industry and pros-
perity of Pennsylvania, yet I must say, when I
see her Representatives waging war upon
almost every other Slate in the Union, I would
not give up the fame Decatur, Bainbridge,
Hull, Lawrence, Perry, and Farragut have
given this nation for all the forty rolling-mills
of Pennsylvania.
SOAP, GLASS, PAPER.
Mr. Chairman, there is comedy as well as
tragedy in this Pennsylvania bill. One cannot
well help laughing when one sees how it has
been gloved, and furred, and velvet-pawed to
suit certain Pennsylvania interests. It is tragic
to sweep out of existence a nation's flag upon
the open seas; but it is comic to hide up and
cover in a tariff bill such innocent looking
items as these:
Line 76 (o/the bill.)—On sal soda and sodacrystals,
one cent per pound.
Line 77 {of the bill.)—On caustic soda, two cents per
pound.
Line 78 (of the hill.)—On chromate and bichromate
of potassa, four and a half ccnts per |,ound.
Now, this looks well enough on paper, for ifc
is only the rise of a duty on—
