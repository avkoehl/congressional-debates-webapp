a Tucker formerly resided in Missouri, and was an editor; published the State Journal, and was subsequently connected with Missouri Republication.

b Formerly Member of Congress from Missouri. Went to Europe in 1863, it is supposed on business for the rebels, where he was in conference with Mason and Slidell. Arrested by this office in 1864 on charge of being a member of the Order of American Knights, but afterward released. Has a brother in rebel artillery service.

c Burned the Robbet Campbell, during which the lives of a number of soldiers were lost.

The foregoing list contains the names of the principal men only, as far as I have been able to ascertain them, and does not embrace any merely suppositious cases. A number of those most needed, it will be observed, are in territory until recently has been occupied by the rebel army, where it will require your authority to operate. I therefore respectfully suggest that your order the commanding generals of the several departments to ascertain whether any of parties above named are within the limits of their jurisdiction; and if so, to arrest and forward them to Saint Louis without delay.

It would be impossible to obtain a correct account of the property destroyed by these parties during the war, but the following list has been traced to one or the other of the men whose names are given above:
