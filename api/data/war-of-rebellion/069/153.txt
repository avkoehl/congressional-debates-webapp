HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 24, 1864-5.10 p.m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I have just taken a prisoner from Field's division. He was on the skirmish line; says the line of battle was about 250 yards behind. That the enemy are in strong force is probable, as we meet them in works all along our front some distance out. I shall make an advance of a division in a few minutes, and will support it, if necessary.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-5.20 p.m.

Colonel J. C. TIDBALL,Chief of Artillery:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you take your batteries across the river, except such as may be in useful positions; also that such as you do not at present place in position you will screen behind the crest. The general also desires to see you.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. R. DRIVER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 24, 1864-6.30 p.m.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy are making a strong attack down the railroad, particularly on Gibbon. Barlow is now going in on his right. It looks to me as if the enemy had a similar line to that on the Po, with the salient resting opposite to Burnside, and their right, so far as we are concerned, thrown back toward Hanover Junction.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
