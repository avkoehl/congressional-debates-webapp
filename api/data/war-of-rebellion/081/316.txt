HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 22, 1864-5.25 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your two dispatches*, the last of 5 p.m., are received. I have fallen back to the position held this morning, by which I can connect with Barlow, and have sent one brigade, all I can spare, to Russell's right to re-enforce him or Barlow. One of your dispatches I should have considered authority for holding my advanced position had it not been received too late, while my troops were moving back. I think the present position, on the whole, the better of the two for defensive purposes, though not for attack. Indeed an attack from my present lines would be very injudicious, I think, as I should probably be forced to carry the works constructed by my men after the advance to-day. It seems to me that our best course for the moment is the defensive, but I will report further as soon as I can see the division commanders, whose views, I believe, coincide with mine, but am not positive.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-6.10 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Yours of 6 p.m. is received,# and I have sent for division commanders to give them their instructions regarding the attack at 7 p.m., which your order. I fear I shall be somewhat late, but every exertion will be used to be ready and to attack at the hour specified. My picket-line has not been moved, and I hope to get the position I have just left without fighting for it.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-8 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

My left, consisting of Ricketts' division, moved forward very handsomely and carried the enemy's advanced position with little resistance. I have halted his division till he can make his connection with the right. I have not heard from my right, nor have I heard any firing except that immediately in my front. If the rest of the line does not move up my left will be very insecure, and even then it is not entirely safe, being in air. I would therefore ask your instructions as to the position to be held to-night.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
