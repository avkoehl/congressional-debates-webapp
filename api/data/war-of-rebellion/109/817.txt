STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Raleigh, February 4, 1864.

His Excellency President DAVIS:

DEAR SIR: Upon more reflection I doubt the propriety of publishing your letter in full. I will try to have the substance of it put before the public through the Fayetteville Observer, which I hope will answer every purpose. The true men of the State are going to work everywhere, and I am greatly in hope that we will be able to manage affairs here without resort to forcible means.

Very truly and respectfully, yours,

Z. B. VANCE.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, and

Honorable S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of Navy:

SIR: The force under my command boarded and captured last night the U. S. gun-boat Underwriter, 4 guns, 90 men and officers. Her position within musket-range of several strong works, one of which was raking the vessel during the time we had possession, and not having steam, caused me to burn her. Our loss is 20 killed and wounded and 4 missing. The enemy's unknown.

Respectfully, &amp;c., your obedient servant,

J. TAYLOR WOOD.

WILMINGTON, February 6, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I have received from General Martin the report Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson, commanding his cavalry. On the 4th instant he proceeded from Sheppardsville to New Berne, destroying bridges and culverts on the raiload. Found city and garrison in great alarm and demoralization, his appearance with cavalry on south side of Trent greatly adding thereto. Reports but 3,000 in New Berne and a re-enforcement of about 700. Peck telegraphed Butler that he could not hold the city. Butler replied hold on, in fifty hours a brigade would reach him; this has not arrived. On the 30th Martin was informed main attack had withdrawn. General Martin and troops were completely successful in carrying out thoroughly their part. Original report sent by mail. Yankees report loss of 1,500 killed, wounded, and captured.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
