APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong----2nd Sess.
Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Brown.
Senate.
Without pretending to be skilled in questions of
finance, it may, said Mr B. be very safely assum-
ed, that two hundred millions of dollars would fur-
nish a very ample amount of currency for the
whole people of the United States, as he had just
shown that the maximum amount of money, of all
kinds, which had been m circulation, at any one
tim°, in this country, did not exceed one hundred
and eighty millions of dollars, and that at a pe-
riod so recent that our population has since under-
gone but little increase
Tt did not lequire as large an amount of curren-
cy m this country, in proportion to our population,
as it did in some of the older and wealthier States
of Europe, for the additional reason that the reve-
nue of the Government here, is small in propor-
tion to many oí the wealthy nation^ there In
France and England, for instance, in each of which
the revenue of Government is very large, and
which circumstance creates a very great demand
for money, bevond the wants of trade and com-
merce, the quantity of currency required to meet
it, must necessarily be greater, in proportion to
population, than m a country like ours, where the
Government demand is comparatively small.
These facts afforded a complete refutation of the
groundless assertions, so frequently made, in re-
ference to this subject, and showed, as he thought,
most conclusively, that, by a most impolitic course
of legislation in this country, both by the States and
the Federal Government, that we had been, as a
nation, most unjustly deprived of our due share of
the precious metals, and possessed a smaller share
of them, in proportion to our commerce and re-
sources, than any one of the gieat commercial
nations m Europe While gentlemen weieso elo-
quent in their denunciat ons of vhat they, enone-
ously, called one currency for the people and
another for the Government, was it not worthy of
their serious attention and consideration, that the
effect of the doctrines and system, which they now
contended for, was, to aid in giving a better cur-
rency to the subjects of the monarchs of Europe,
and a baser and inferior one to the citizens of our
own country, by the effectual banishment of gold
and silver irom the United States'!
Mr B said, in bringing forward *he facts and
arguments adduced hj htm, m relation to go'd and
sil/er, he repeated that it was not with the most re-
mote expectation, that a cuirency of that kind,
would ever entirely supersede the paper system
here, for he tegarded the alarms that weie expíen-
sed for the late of that system, as ridiculous and
absurd. The apprehension much more justly to
be entertained is, he would again repeat, not that
the system will be overthrown, for it has ample
power to take care of itself, but that it vull be ut-
terly unavailing to keep it within salutary limits.
He believed that the measure now pioposed, to
separate the fiscal action of the Government en-
tirely from the banks, and to return, by a slow and
giadu?i process, to the collection of its revenues in
gold and silver, to be accomplished in a period of
six years, as provided m the bill, was the
only practicable means now left to the coun-
try, to restore a larger portion of metallic
currency, to bring vuthm more moderate limits,
the present expanded paper system, and to res-
cue the liberties and institutions of the nation,
from its now almost irresistible influence. If the
Federal Government now abandons this high con-
stitutional duty, the opportunity is forever lost, and
it will be equivalent to a sentence of lamshment
fiom our shores ot our due proportion of the precious
metals It would not only be better for the Go-
vernment and the people, which in this country
constituted but the same thing, but it would be a
benefit to the banks themselves, by placing them
on their own proper intrinsic credit, (which was
the only true credit system,) and removing them
from the influence of politics, and the temptations
to over-issue", induced by their having possession
of the public revenues The Government demand
for specie would compel the banks to be careful,
and avoid over-issues, which would afford an ad-
mirable check, now so much needed by them On
the other hand, the Government demand for specie,
by bringing moie of it from abroad, and throwing
it constantly m circulation, through the means of
its expenditures would strengthen the banks, by
affording a more abundant supply of the metals,
for them to supply themseh es with. The effect of
the measure, then, on the paper system of this coun-
try, according to this view, would be to prevent a
fradulent system of banking, and to promote a
more honest one, and wa^, therefore, a measure
emmenth for the good of the people at large.
Never vt as an argument more delusive, if argu-
ment it deserved to be called than that which so
erroneously assumed that the measure proposed
was for the benefit of the Government, at the ex-
pense of the interests of the people It was, as he
thought he had already shown, a measure emi-
nently for their benefit, by affording the only means
now left to restore to circulation among them a
larger proport'on of sound currency, and which
they had a right to demand of the Government, as
one of the highest duties which it owes to them.
The idea that it would operate unjustly on the peo-
ple, for itb aues to be received in the currency pro-
vided in the bi'l, was equally groundless and falla-
cious. What'ver advantage was gamed to the
Government, in thus collecting it, wnUd,w the dis-
bursement and expenditure of the money, (for it
would necessa  dy pay out the same money which it
received,) be fully returned to the people in that
way. The loss and the gain to them, therefore,
being equal, in the process of receiving and paying
out the money by the Government, the advantage
and disadvantage would, of course, be equal The
objection that it would benefit the office holders, is
entitled to little weight They receive but a very
small pioportion of the amount collected by the
Government, the great sources of public expendi-
ture beng to cany on the different branches of the
public serv ce, and the great measures of policv
with whicn the Government i« charged There-
fore, whatever sums are paid by it, either to us
officers, or on account of appropriation , to carry
on its measures of policy, must, of nece¡¡,suy, re-
turn to genernl circulation, and, therefore, confers,
m that way, a coextensive pub'ic benefit
He had heard, with very deep regret, expressions
almost constantly used here in debate, drawing a
distinction between the people and their Govern-
ment It was perfectly fair and proper, m those
who deemed it their duty to do so, to criticise and
arraign the acts of tbe Administration; but when
gentlemen spoke of a distinction between the Go-
vernment and the people of this country, he consi-
dered the doctrine as dangerous, disorganizing, and
tending, by diffusing hostility towards it, to subvert
our institutions, lie must be allowed to say,
that those who used it were forgetful of the nature
of our Government, and that >t and the people
were, in a political point of view but the same
thing. It was but the creature of their will, and,
being of their w ill, is, acco-dmg to its principles,
under their control and direction
He nevei was more entirely convinced of the
utter absurdity of any proposition, than he was of
that winch gent erren undertook to maintain, that
trie pioposed measure wou'd bring more of power
and patronage to the Executive branch of the Go-
vernment, than would be produced by continuing
a connection w ith the banks It w as but another
proof that, in politics, as well as m religion, there is
no eiror, however gieat and absurd, "that does
not find some sober brow to bless it, and pppiove
it with a text " It was, in bis opinion, one of the
highest excellences of the system, that its tendenev
would be directly the reverse of that thus ascribed
to it By a connection of the fiscal affairs of the
Gov crnment either with a National Bank oi the
State banks, it is indirectly giving it connol and
influence over nut only the whole banking capital,
but, through it, over the whole moneved power,
of the country From the power which the Execu-
tive branch of'lhe Government would necessarily
have, under any law directing the deposite of the
public moneys with the banks, to select fiom among
then number foi that purpose,-subservience to Exe-
cutive views, would, from the veiy nature of
things, exist to a cons.derable extent With ai
Administration m power which was of Federal
politics, these monopolies would be certain to be in
stiong sympathy. Would it not, then, be dangei-
ou¡> to the hbeities of this country, to place again m
the hands of the Executive an engine of such tre-
mendous power? Would it not be placing in the
hands of a reckless and ambitious Administration,
if such an one should unfortunately ever be
elevated to power, the means of enabling them to
defy the public will, and to perpetuate their
own party ascendancy'' When the strength and
influence of the moneyed power had already be-
come so great as to constitute it, in fact, a fourth
estate under our Government, and seeking, as it
was, to absorb the powers ot the others, did not
considerations of wisdom and caution, admonish us
to pause, befoie we again gave it so dangerous a
political reorganization, as would practically result
from its reunion with the Government That its
pretensions had alarmingly increased, was most
manifest in the pioceedings of its friends, going on,
in and out of Congress, in relation to restoring to
the banks the custody of the public revenue It
was formerly considered a mere matter of favor, for
the Government to deposite its revenues with the
banks, and one which was to be dore, or not, at its
option It is now no longer considered in that
light, and the possession of its revenues is called
for, in a v oice, dictatorial and commanding, or ex-
pulsion from power is the threatened consequence'
This circumstance marked, more distinctly, its
growing pretensions, than did any thing else. He
insisted on it, that there could be no comparison,
between the extent of influence derived Irom a con-
trol over the moneyed power, which a reunion with
the Government and banks would place in the
bands of the Executive, and that given by the very
small addit onal number ol officers, contemplated
bv the ptesent bill
That the influ-nce of banking institutions, when
looking to Government for favors, was dangerous,
was proven by the facts exhibited in *he report of a
committee of the Senate, made in 1834, appointed
to mv eotigate the affairs ol the Bank of the United
States That report exhibited the startling fact,
that near a halt million oí dollars had been loaned
tomembeisof Congress during the pendency of
important questious before Congress, affecting its
own continuance and interests In addition to the
heavy amount loaned to members of Congress, was
the large amount loaned to editors of leading poli-
tical influence The press and the legislative halls
being two of the strongest pointa in our political
system, for the defence of the whole, corruption,
whenever it makes an assault on it, will always
endeavor, by attempting to make a successful
lodgmsni, first to overcome those points that are of
most importance, in aiding its designs It ism this
view, that there is so much danger in a connection
between the Government and the bank'. The in-
fluence of the latter is subt'e, insinuating, and often
ímneiceptio'e to the pubuc eye It often assumes
tr>egaioand disguise of disinterested patriotism,
when the individual who is operated on by its se-
cret power is but the slave oí its selfish will, while
loud in professions of the pnbuc good In this re-
spect it ,s ?n influence infinitely more dangerous
to the public liberty than the Executive patronage
wh'ch we hear so much denounced, for the Execu-
tive, in bestowing official honors and appointments,
makes Know n to the country the objects of Ins fa-
voi, fiom the veiy nature of the case, while the re-
cipients uf bank lav ors are, in a great degiee, con-
cealed fiom the publ cejt
Anothti objection, entitled to weighty considera-
tion, connected with the subject ef the mciease of
patronag , which a íeunion of the banks with the
Government will give to the lattei, is that which
w as so ablj and forciblj urged by the Senator from
South Caiolma, [JUr Cvlholn ] and, in the course
oflns observation on which, he clearlv proved that
the tendency of it is to arrav the hinkmg interest
agamsi the tttx-paytis, and in favor of the tax-con-
minm If the public moneys aie deposited with
the hanks, it will make it their interest that the re-
venue should be incieased, for the plain reason,
that they will leceiVL a lauer sum of the public
money on deposite They would, therefore, have
a direct interest in sumulatnig the taxing power of
the Government to excessive action, m order to
profit by it
In the progress of the present discussion, the
charge had been, gravely made against  the late
