Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
extinguishment of the Indian title to this land is
desirable The Hon Mr. Hunter, representing
that district in Congress, and N H Swayne, Esq,
of Columbus, have had, on the invitation of the
Department, various interviews with the Wyan-
dots, and Mr. Swayne has been instructed to nego-
tiate with them on the most hbe-al terms
By the amended treaty of 1834 with the Mi-
amies, atieady lefcrred to, ^50,000 were appropri-
ated to pay their deots A commissioner was ap-
pointed to examine them, and it was discovered
that, so far from ^50,000 being equal to their dis-
chaige, they had greatiy accunuiuted since 1834,
and amounted to upwaitls ot |,200,000 It is piob
able, that to obtain a fund to relieve themselves
from this unexpected embanassment, they may be
disposed to cede a part of their remaining; lands
The Osages, by their treaty of June, 1821), con-
veyed an extensive tiact of country to the United
States The sum agieed to be paid foi it was di-
vided and absorbed m various ways, so that not
much benefit resulted to them, except the tempo
rary relief afforded by the distubution of money
and clothing at the payment of then small annu
lties They weie pool and destitute, and they
plundered oui citizens and oiher tribes Congress,
at its last session, having, for one object, to place
the Osages above the temptation todo wion , made
an appropnation fin a tieaty to extinguish, reads
the law, "then title to leseriations in la.ids within
other tribes, and foi other purpose? " The con-
duct of the negotiation authou/ed has been in-
trusted to Geneial J\l Aibiukleand Captain Wil-
liam Armetiong, who, in conformity with what
was believed to be the wish and intention of Con-
gress m making tbeapproprntion, were mstiucted
to engage for allowances and payments on a lib-
eral scale
A tieaty with the Hew York Indians has been
for some time in a coiuse of negotiation, for their
lands at Green Bay It at one peuod assumed a
shape which induced the commissioner, who was
ehaiged with that duty, to accept it, but the Sen-
ate prescribed ceitam amendments, upon the full
assent of the Indians to wnich it was to be promul-
gated These changes the commissioner laid be-
fóle them, with full explanation in council, and
obtained the assent of all the tubes, in a munnei
entirely satisfactoty, except tintofthelaigest one,
the Sénecas A fuller expie^sion of then willing
ness to accept the teims proposed was deemed
pioper and necessaiy,and the honoiable Mr Gil-
iet, the commissionet, his been requested to lay it
again befoie them, with a view to such consent, if
they choose to yve It Should they ciedme to do
so, the treaty, by its own ptovisions and the leso
lution of the Senate, will nevei theless be latified as
to the othei tubes When the íepoit is brought
in, such course as it makes pro,ici will he taken
I subjoin a part of a leport of the comrmsMoner,
made on the 29th of De embei, 1837, wnich con
tains some mloimation that may, peihaps, be in-
teresting, lespectmg these Indians, of whom com-
paratively lit'le is known out of the region they
inhabit
Geneial Arbuckie and Captain Armsti mghave
been also chaigfd to treat with the Creeks, " tor
1 the purpose of adjusting the claims foi property
'and improvements abandoned or lost, in conse
' quence of then emigiation west of the Missis-
' sippi "
It has been deemed advisable to attempt a nego-
tiation with the united bands of Ottiwas, Chrppe-
was, and Pottawatomies, north of Missouri, for
their lands, and Major John Dougherty and Major
A h Davis have been instructed on the subject
Under the treaty with the Cherokees, eommis
sionerss to value their improvements unci examine
the debts due by the nation and the individual mem-
bers thereof have been engaged in the arduous and
necessarily protracted duties assigned to them,
which have been discharged by the different gen-
tlemen who at various times have constituted the
commission, in a manner that is believed to be
highly beneficial to tne Cherokees At what time
then labors may be expected to close, I have no
it eans of ascertaining, but 1 have no diubt they
wi1 be tei initiated at as early a day as consists
wííi  s  stice to a Í "oicer^ed
Anthony Ten  Eyc'i, Esq , of M.chgan, was
recently appointed, under the fourth article of the
treaty with the Chippewas of Saginaw, which
provides for the liquidation of their debts, and
the ascertainment of the depredations committed
by them, a commissioner to make the inquiries
preliminary to payment
Under the act of Congress of the 3d of March,
1837, a commissioner was constituted to examine
claims for spoliations committed by the Cieek and
Seminole Indians, in Georgia, Alabama, and Flor-
ida A report of examinations in the two former
was made by Messrs Pease and Smith, m No-
vetrbei, 1837, which was submitted to Congress
in Januaiy,1838 The hostilities in florida pre-
vented any action by them in that Territory It
was not thought proper to direct their further
progress until the report made was acted on by
Congress When it shall be judged necessary, a
renewal of the investigations of the commission
will be required, and an enlargement of the law
constituting it, so as to extend its jurisdiction to
the State of Mississippi, is recommended, that
depredations committed by the last Creek emi-
grants at Pass Christian, or elsewhere, may be
examined
The commission, consisting of Alfred  Balch,
Fsq , and the undeisigned, raised under the leso
lution  of  the   House of  Representatives  of the
United States, of 1st Inly, 1836, has lately closed
the investigations committed to it     The field to
be exploied was very wide, and it is hoped the
examinations have been as extensive and thorough
as, under the circumstances, could be expected
Ihe repoits made up to the close of the last ses-
sion of Congress have been heietofore, by your
direction, transmitted to the House of Repiesen-
tatives, and the further reports, since made, will,
it is presumed, take the same couise     The con
tiact  made  by certain Cieek chiefs with J   C
Watson & Co , provides for the appointment of
an agent, to decide between it and such conflicting I
claims as might arise, the parties, opposed in m-
teiest to that deed, called for the appointment of
such a commissioner    The person designated for
that duty resigned,and a successoi will be selected
The act of Congiess of Mareh, lb37, provided
foi the appointment ofthteecommissioners, *' who
'shall constitute a boaid for the adjustment and
' decision  of all  claims of the Choctaw heads of
' families, foi reservations of land,undei thefcur
' teenth aitide of the tieaty concluded with said
' Choctaw nation at Duiutig Rabbit Creek," on
the ¿8th September, 1810    Undei this law, James
Murray, Lsq , of Maryland, I'  D Vioom,Esq ,
of New jersey, and 1' R R Piay, L q , of Mis-
sissippi, weie apiomted,  but the  Utter having
resigned,  Roger  Hartón,   Lsq ,   of  Mississippi,
was   elected to supply the vacancy    They assem-
bled in the State of Mississippi, and entered upon
then   duties     Pending their discharge, the com
mission, which would have expired by the limita
tion contained in the law that cieated it, «.as ex
tended, by the act ot 2JJ  February, 1838, until
the 1st Au¿ust last     On the 31st July, Messrs
Murray md Vioom made a report of then opm
ions upon two bundled and sixty one cases, and
state that the number of claimants, whose names
weie filed with them, amounts, according to the
lists returned with the íepoit, to upwauls of one
thousand  three hundred, and that '  it is undei
stood thiee are other claims yet to be filed "    I
would lespectfully suggest thitfuithei legislative
piousion   be  lecommended, foi   examining  the
claims that have not been investigated
Tne performance of the stipulations for reser-
vations, contained in several treaties, is complete
in some instances, while in those moie impoitant
and difficult, and lequmng time, they ha\e been
o.ily paitully executed Piogiess in the lattei is,
however, making, and it is expected that what-
ever the tieaties and law require will be peifected
as eaily as practicable
The investment of moneys raised by sales of
ceded lands, under treaty piovisions, or paid for
cessions, has latteilv been carried to a considera-
ble extent It 's a most be íehVent policy, which
furnishes an annuil resource to tno^e who woJd
as cerr inl) expend the puncipal in a twelvemonth
as Lie income of the st eks Ihe mmistrmsputto
intei est, under the direction of this office, for Indian
use, amount to $1,776,321 76, and yield yearly
$92,722 92 The tabular exhibit herewith sub-
mitted shows the nature of the investment, how
much belongs to tribes respectively, and other par-
ticulars, which it may be gratifying to look at
Future sales of lands will increase this source of
comfort and supply. It not being convenient to
invest some of the amounts agreed to be so dis-
posed of by late treaties, Congress appropriated
sums equal to the aggregate of interest that would
have accrued according to the rate provided.
This is doing full justice to the Indians, until it
shall suit the Treasury to set the necessary capital
aside.
An act of Congiess was passed on the 7th of
July last, appropriating $150,000 "for affording
' temporary subsistence to such Indians west of
' the Mississippi, who, by reason of their iecent
' emigration, or the territorial arrangements inci-
' dent to the policy of setting apart a portion of the
' public domain west of the Mississippi, for the
' residence of all the tribes residing east of that
' river, as are unable to subsist themselves, and for
' the expenses attending the distubution of the
' same " This sum was " to be expended under
' the direction of the Secretary of War " Soon
aftei, viz on 28 h July, 1818, íegulations were
prescribed for carrying out tne intentions of the
Legislatuie, and orders were issued to the proper
agents for this purpose No returns of those
entitled to the benefits of this gratuity have been
received, but it is, doubtless, in a course of distri-
bution, and the donation will be received by those
for whom it was supposed to be designed
The puncipal lever by which the Indians are to
be lifted out of the mire of folly and vice in which
they are sunk is education The learning of the
already civilised and cultivated man is not what
they want now It could not be advantageously
ingrafted on so íude a stock In tne present state
of their social existence, all they could be taught,
or would learn, is to read and write, with a very
limited knowledge of figures There aie excep-
tions, butm thegeneral the remark is true,and per-
haps more is not desirable or would be useful As
tney advance, a more liberal culture of their minds
may be effected, if happily they should yield to
the influences that, if not roughly thrust back, will
ccitamly follow in the wake of propeily directed
effoits to improve their understandings. To at-
tempt too much at once is to insure failure You
must lay the foundations broadly and deeply, but
gradually, if you would succeed. To teach a
savage man to read, while he continues a savage
in all else, is to throw seed on a rock. In this par-
ticular there has been a general erroi If you
would win an Indian fiom the waywardness and
idleness and vice of his life, you must improve his
moials, as well as his mind, and that not merely
by piecept,but by teaching mm how to farm, how
I to woik in the machine aits, and how to labor
i piofitably, so that, by enabling hmi to find his
comfort in charged pursuits, he will fall into those
habits which aie in keeping with the useful appli-
I ration of such education ¡.s may be given him
Ihus too, only, it is conceived, are men to be
' chr stiamzed, the beginning is some education,
social and nroial lives, the end may be the bright-
est hope But this allusion ought not, perhaps, to
have been made, upon it 1 ceitamly will not en-
laii'e it is in better hands Manual labor schools
are what the Indian condition calls for TheMis-
sionai y Society of theMethodia EpiscopalChurch
has laid before the Departmenta plan, based upon
the idea suggested, for establishing a large central
school for the education of the western Indians
Into their scheme enter a farm, and shops for
teaching the different mechanic arts Experience,
they say, has shown them, after much opportunity
for judging correctly, that separate schools for the
respective tribes, thuugh productive of much good,
are not so useful as one common scftool for the
benefit of all would be They assert truly that a
knowledge of the English language is necessary,
and they think that it can be best acquned in an
establishment of the latter description I would
not 1 azírd a different opinion, and yet it may not
be ímoioper to state, that the funds which have
been set apait for education purposes belong to
the several tribes, without wnosá consent the
