The enemy has increased his forces considerably. His strong position is just behind Cashtown. My party toward Mummasburg met a superior force, strongly posted. Another party that went up the road due north, 3 miles out, met a strong picket; had a skirmish, and captured a prisoner of Re's division. Another party that went toward Littlestown heard that Gregg or Kilpatrick and a fight with Stuart, and drove him to Hanover.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

General REYNOLDS.

My extreme left reports a large force coming from toward Fairfield, in a direction to strike the Emmitsburg road this side of Marsh Creek.

Reliable.

Respectfully,

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

General PLEASONTON.
