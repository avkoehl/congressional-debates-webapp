MAY 31, 1863-10 a. m.

Major-General DIX,

Fort Monroe:

Agreeably to your request, directions have been given for the dismounted men of Colonel Kilkpatrick's cavalry to report to you. Will you please have me furnished with a map of the position of your forces at West Point, and also the position and approximate strength of the enemy's forces in that vicinity? We have concurrent evidence that Hood's division is posted between Gordonsville and Louisa Court-House, and Pickett's at Taylorsville (near Sexton's Junction). Longstreet is in front of me. I conclude that General Lee must be absent, as I have received no communication from him in reply to mine since a week ago yesterday.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding

FORT MONROE, May 31, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER:

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

It has been decided to withdraw form West Point, and throw the force three up the Peninsula toward Whit House. I can get no satisfactory information as to the enemy's force. There was last week a considerable body massed north of Richmond, on the railroad, ready to support Lee at Fredericksburg or Wise at White House. I can hear nothing of them since Wednesday. I will advise you of all my movements. My force is small.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
