Nothing has been done to-day at slashing, as General Sumner thinks them unnecessary, if not injurious. Smith's rifle-pits and two epaulements for guns completed last night. Enemy shelling us again without effect this evening.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH PROVISIONAL ARMY CORPS,Camp near New Bridge, Va., June 10, 1862.

General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff, Headquarters, Army of Potomac:

GENERAL: I desire to present for the consideration of the commanding general the propriety of instructing the outpost guards to comped to come into our ranks all of the enemy who approach our lines, as did the relief to-day at Woodbury's Bridge; and if they attempt to run away to fire upon them. The pretexts of procuring a paper, to give our men a chew of tobacco, &amp;c, are too often made to procure information, and to-day it may have been done to ascertain if we could suddenly re-enforce Smith or attack their location. Several officer were in the same vicinity and followed close on the heels of the visitor. No other information could have been obtained than that the water was waist deep, to fact of the highest importance to them. I am informed that the work erected near James Garnett's house can be seen from the fact ascertained to-morrow early.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. J. PORTER,

Brigadier-General, Commadning.
