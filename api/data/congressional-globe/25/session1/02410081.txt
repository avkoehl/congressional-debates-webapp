gold and silver m the country, for the national pa-
per, which is the cheaper currency, expels the spe-
cie, which ¡s the more \ aiuabie    In pursuance of
this universal law of the monetary system, we hare
seen that, at the period of the -veto of the United
States Bank, there was bat about twenty millions
of dollars of specie in the country, and now there
is eighty millions, which, in the absence of a na-
tional bank, must and «ill go on augmenting
But, it may be asked, why should the State banks
desire the c-eation of a national bank, by the aug-
mentation of its circulation to usurp the channels
of circulation, that might otherwise be occupied by
the State banks? Because the paper of the national
banks, whilst it diminishes the specie that must be
kept on hand by the State banks, enables them to
make more money on a less actual specie capital
But this is not all    with the is ues of paper by the
national bank, added  to the  State bank issues,
there is, till the explosion comes, a temporary rise
oí property, thus requiring more money m circula-
tion to meet the a ugmented price of property  I have
called it an augmentation of the nominal price of
property, but it is m fact no increase ot its, real va-
lue, but a sinking, a debasement, of the value of
money, arising from the augmented circulation 1--
qmnng larger nominal amounts of bank paper to
make purchase, arid co lduct all transactions    No
addition is made to the real wealth and real capi-
tal of the nation, the only addition is to the danger-
ous amount of bank paper circulation and the n-
crease of bank dividends     Hence it is that the *
State banks desne a national bank, not as a íegu-
lator to contiact their   issues, but m order to issue
more paper on a sma'Ier specie basis, and thus en-
large their profits     Hence it is, also, that with the
enlargement or conti action of the issues of the na-
tional bank, the State banks generally enlarge or
contract also, the national bmk piper being --ubsti-
tuted in pHce of a spec e basis     Herce t is, thit,
were a na'ional bank crtated as our fiscal agent
and depository, it would be the interest of all the
State banks to augment its deposites by increasing
the tariff, and thereby augment its own circulation,
so as to dimmish the demand upon them for specie
to redeem then paper    It is interest, th'-n, and not
a desire to be controlled or i emulated b) a national
bank, that urges the S'?te banks to desire the esta-
blishment of a national  institution     And had it
been established, and continued to this dav   we
should have hid m the countr> but twenty millions
of specie onlv , and with a paocr c r"ulat on <* ea l\
expanded, and *■   el   n t u¡ on    peo t, bu uron
national ba ík naptr urculal   n ai d when the con
vulsion came—as come it must—the Stat  banks
could not ha,e existed foi a mo nent, having little
or no specie
With the general wish and umv°isal extinction
of confidence, the United States Bank must have
fallen, (as its successor has lately dene ) an < fit
suffering woi Id have ber-n more intens , and of
longei duration If any doubt this lattpi stat m >nt
let them look to the period of 1818, 1819, when, on
account chiefly of the enoimous over-issues bv the
national bank first, and Sta'e banks afterwards,
the crash came, the Un ted States Bank, reduced
to one do'lar ir spec e, for evei v one hundred m
circulation, was barely saved from suspension,
but, in saving it, the State banks and people weie
ruined, and the most míense suffeung and prostra-
tion of business pievailed duung a period of three
yeais Now, even since the Message was pub-
lished, confidence is already reviv ng, depreciated
bank paper has risen—stocks hav e risen, ai d bu-
siness is lecommenced Vfhv this dffcrence be
tween the pressures of 1838, 1819, md of 1837')
The eighty millions nf specie, around which public
confidence can rally, creates the diffeience, as con-
stituting the great basis for the resumption of spe-
cie payments, whereas, bid a great national bmk
been in existence, and substituted its panp] as it
would, by expelí ng tne precious metals, when lhc>
explosion came, the very existence of this na-
tional paper enneney would, as «"did Hi 1818 ami
1819, but mciease the catastrophe, by he effort,
which the great national bank did then, aw\
must ever make m such a convulsion to sa\e
itself by calling m its issues, by curtailing and
necessanlj   foitifjm^ itself  with specie   drained
6
from the State banks, which fa'l immediately be-
neath the pressure This whole pretence of legu-
lation of the State banks by the United States
Bank is founded on the following by-law
Articie 25 "The offices of discount and depo-
site shall at least once every week settle with the
State banks for their notes received in payment of
the revenue, or for the engagements of individuals
to the bank, so as to prevent the balance due to
the office fiom swelling to an inconvenient amount "
Now this regulating article could hive none or
at least a very trifling effect upon the di tant banks,
whose paper does not reach the ofTee of dis-
count of 'he Bank of the Un ted States Ind
even as regards the banks affected by this ar-
ticle, are they bj its terms or directions to set-
tle these balances in specie^ No, the-e is no
such pavment req ured, and in point of fact, it is
rarely, if evei, made, and tnerefoie does not com-
pel the State banks to enlarge tneir specie, and
check their operations, on the contrarv, these
balances are settled oy diafts on other banks, and
iedrarts from fhem,oiten meie bank kites, founded
o i mere credit arrangements betvv een then, or by ex-
change often composed of mere accommodation mer-
cantile acceptance^ endowed bj the Staie bmks,
and thus, or by othei credit accommoditi ins tnese
basnets are set'led, but rot a dollar of sroldor s 1-
vei is seen in lve «hoi" transaction And vvhv is
it ihat these State banks (which Mr Bidd'e te Is a-,
existed only bv the forbearance ol tne Bark of the
United States) are not piessed to pay these balances
m gold and silver' The great regulator dare not
do it It would break some two or three State
banks, confidence wou'd vanish, runs would be
made on many other S ate banks wh'ch, having
httie or no sp cie, pay out till they breik, the notes
of the United States Bank are then poured m noon
it for specie, a d it must break all the bmks,
and mm the v, jntiy b, pre sure and cnr'ai1
ments, or suspu 1 Mso The v hole system
is founded, not on a sppc e has s—for it
is not there, in any of the banks, State or na-
tional—but upon confidence that all these notes
are convertible into specie upon demand, and when-
ever a convulsion comes, this confidence in «,11
bank piper is sha! en, it i  or sprtcd for redemption
in specie, it cannot be rcdpem°d, the delusion va-

hue to the level of onrjet convenible bankpaper.
But prices of almost everv article being much
higher here than abroad, vast importations, beyond
the power of the country long to consume, neces-
sarily ensue, our bank paper is forced upon the
banks for redempt on in specie, to be shipped
abroad, where it is mo-e valuable than here, and
ex:nlosnn sooi follows So ceitain and unerring

A national bank w e have seen, can neither rurí-

It was with no ordinary p'easure, ihat I

by the friends of a bank is fought and lost, if they,
on their return to the r cors'itucnts, w ill tell them,
and tell them trn'y that thcie is not under any cir-
