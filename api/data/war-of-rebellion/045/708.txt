CHERRY RUN, VA., July 15, 1863. (Received 8. 25 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

Your telegram received. I moved back to this point the morning, and am now crossing my cavalry by swimming the horses over. River falling. Hope to cross a portion of my infantry and artillery to-morrow. Jenkin's force is encamped near North Mountain Station, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. I trust I shall be able to drive him from there soon. Jackson is again threatening Beverly. I will be compelled to send some force to re-enforce Colonel Moor, commanding there. As soon as I can possibly get my force across, I will follow the range of North Mountain, and annoy the enemy's flank all I can.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
