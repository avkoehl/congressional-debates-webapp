HEADQUARTERS, November 28, 1863.

General M. JENKINS,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Your letter is received. The work of the enemy is not inclosed. The ditch is probably at some points not more than 3 feet deep and 5 or 6 feet wide; at least, we so judged it yesterday in looking at a man walk down the parapet and over the ditch. I thought that you saw the man, as you had been with us. I have no apprehension of the result of the attack if we go at it. We should avail ourselves of everything, however, that may aid or relieve us. After your first brigade has gained the enemy's lines, I desire that it should wheel to the left and pursue the attack to the left along the enemy's rear and on his right, and your other brigade should conform to this movement. Johnson's division will be ordered to follow it. Keep your men well at their work, and do not listen to the idea of failing and we shall not fail. If we go in with the idea that we shall fail, we will be sure to do so. But no men who are determined to succeed can fail. Let me urge you not to entertain such feelings for a moment. Do not let any one fail, or any thing.

I remain, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
