The enemy appeared very much demoralized and did not seem to want to give us battle after this. Holding our position twenty or thirty minutes without another attack (the skirmishing still going on) we concluded to mount and pass around the enemy to the west and join you. It was getting late and darkness came on before we had gone a mile.

It is proper to say in this connection that I arrested Major Laing when this affair was reported to me, but upon explanations, and in consideration of his gallantry elsewhere, I directed his release. This report of Lieutenant Roberts shows the operations in the vicinity of Hickman Mills, and also the movement of the enemy westward at the close of the day's fighting. This repulse by the militia was a gallant affair and must have greatly annoyed the rebels, who found resistance on all sides of them. Other staff officers, Major Weed, Major Curtis, Captain Meeker, of the signal corps, Surgeon Davis, Lieutenant Robinson, were also active in carrying out my orders. My volunteer aides, Honorable s Senators Lane and Pomeroy, were earnest and very efficient in the field. Senator Pomeroy was especially active in bringing the militia forward and correcting their impressions as to the movements, while Senator Lane's experience in former campaigns in Mexico and upon the Kansas border enabled him to be of much service in the field everywhere. Colonel Crawford, Colonel Roberts, Colonel Ritchie, and Colonel Cloud, of my volunteer aides, all of whom had experience and zeal to stimulate their exertions, were active, efficient, and useful throughout this and other days of this campaign. Surgeon Davis and Surgeon Harvey were active in their care of the wounded.

Reference to the accompanying map* will show the scope of operations during the day and the general result.

Our left and center had not been moved by the enemy, and although our extreme right had been pressed back our closing efforts were encouraging. The enemy now having possession south of us, after night concealed our movements I ordered the main forces to take position within the lines of fortification which surrounded Kansas City, where they could get rest and supplies, to which place I moved my own headquarters. About 6 o'clock of this evening I also received verbal intelligence of the arrival of General Rosecrans' advance, under Major-General Pleasonton, with cavalry, at Independence, where it was stated he had struck General Pleasonton, with cavalry, at Independence, where it was stated he had struck General Price's rear. This intelligence came about 6 o'clock in the evening, and being circulated among my forces inspired new hopes and energies in the Army of the Border.

BATTLE OF WESTPORT.

Night closing the battle of Big Blue on the 22nd, I ordered my troops under cover of the darkness to concentrate within the lines of fieldworks that inclosed Kansas City, Mo., only a small force remaining in front of Westport near the long line of camp-fires that marked the position and vastly superior numbers of the rebel forces. The citizens and soldiers had so improved the natural strength of Kansas City as to make this position almost impregnable, and being well furnished with food, forage, and ammunition, I replenished exhausted stores and secured my weary soldiers a few hours' repose, which, after so many days of marching, watching, and fighting, we all very much needed. But in view of to-morrow my officers were put to a new test of their powers of endurance. The enemy had halted south of Westport, and
