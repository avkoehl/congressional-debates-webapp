DEEP BOTTOM, VA., July 21, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

General Benham was here this afternoon and talked to General Foster in relation to the bridges. General Foster desires me to say that General Benham thought it would be a very tedious job to build a bridge across the creek and swamp, but approved of the idea of building another bridge across the James. And he (Benham) told him there were boats at City Point which he was keeping for an emergency, but that we could have what boats we wanted. The canvas pontoon will do, but if possible to procure the French boats they will be more useful and easier to use, particularly when we will have to swing the bridge or use a large draw. When I was at City Point a few weeks ago there were about 100 boats there. I believe none of them have been sent away.

Captain, &c.

Captain LUBEY, Jones' Neck:

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
