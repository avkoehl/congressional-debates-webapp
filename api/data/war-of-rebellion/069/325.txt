As soon as the general lines the troops are to occupy have been determined and reached after a movement, corps commanders will at once locate their headquarters, and communicate the position of the same to these headquarters, so that the commanding general may know where to send dispatches to them, and, when practicable, have the telegram line promptly run out.
