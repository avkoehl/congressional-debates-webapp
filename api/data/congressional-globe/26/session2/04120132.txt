This is the result of the statement of the account
■with the whole public domain. A statement ap-
plicable to the lands ceded by the States simply,
making the namber of acies of land surveyed and
sold, and the amount of purchase money received,
the rule of proportion of charge as to the items to
be divided, such as the expenses of the General
Land Office, and the t like, and preserving the
principles of the former statement as to annuities,
presents the following result.
Payments to and for the State of Georgia, the
five per cent, to the new States, all the expenses
of the local land ofiVes, ?nd the proportion of the
expense of the General Land Office, of surve}s,
and the like, applicable to the ctded lands, up to
the 30th of September, 1339, had amounted to
116,416,589 11
The proportion applicable to these
lands, of the expenses of extin-
guishment of the Indian title,
including the annuities and
other liabilities jet unpaid, as
nearly as it is possible to ascer-
tain the proportion from the
treaties and appropnations, is     83,476,888 84
Thus sbowng the actual cost to
the Treasury of the «eded lands
uo to the 30ih of September,
1839, to be       -           -           - $99,893 371 95
A statement from the General Land
Office shows that the whole gross
receipts from the sales of the
ceded lands, up to the date men-
tioned, have been   -           -      $98,786,265 56
Thjs leaf es a balance in favor of
the Treasury, and against the
ceded lands alone   considered,
and simply comparing the ex-
penses loi their account with
the receipts   from  their sales,
up to the date named, of      -       $1,107,206 39
There might be slight errors in these calcula-
tions, but it would be perfectly apparent to any one
who would make himself acquainted with ihe sub-
ject, that if the results varied from the exact truth,
that variation would be found to be in favor of
and not against the lands, in either statement    No
items ol expenditure had been included which had
not been incurred, while  it  was scarcely posible
that sime should not hive been overlooked, which
shoitid uttly have been embraced    It should also
be remaiki d hen, that noihing is included in either
of thes    statements   to  covri   the ex penses o   the
various Indiiiu wars which have grown oat of the
treotte  for the purchase of lands and the execu-
tion of them by the removal of the Indians from
the L nds sold.
There have been, then, no nett proceeds fiom
the sales oí the public lands even to apply towards
the extinguishment of that Revolutionary debt
which the cessions of the States are  -aid to have
liten made to extinguish, and much less to distri-
bute to ibe States over and above that debt So

which parsed b tb Houses of Corgress dur ng
his adawois lation, prouJimj for a temporary dis
tnbution ot the nett pioceeds of the public lands
among ti e State , he would lay down another po-
sition, which the tacts would sustain It was that
the Slatis received from tne United S ates more
money, under the deposite act ot 1836, than they
vould have received under either of the six land
bilis which bad been introduced into that body, by
an honorable Senator from Kentucky, [Mr, Clay]
Pre-emption Law—Mr. Wright.
if either of thoie bills had been pasved and become
laws, and especially the one which did pass the
two Houses, and failed for the want of the signa-
ture of ihe President.
The first four of these bills, including that one
which passed the two Houses, proposed to make
the distribution for a period ot live years, com
menctng with 1833, and ending with 1837, and
simply directed that "the nett proceeds" should be
distributed in a certain manner, without prescrib-
ing any rule by which nett proceeds should be de-
termined.   As, therefore, the ru'e he had la'd down
was manifestly the fair and just one, he should
make the comparison based upon that rule   Before
proceeding to do that, however, it was du«" to the
subject to remark, that the period selected by the
honorable Senator for the operation of these bills,
turned out to be far the most fortunate for his plan
of distribution, and for this comparison in that as
pec, which could have been selected since thscom
mencement of the land sysk m.    It was a fact that
the receip's into the Treasury fiom the lands, dur-
ing the five years named, were more than hall of
the whole amount of those  receipts from the first
land sales in 1794, to the clo«e of the jear 1859, a
period of forty-five year?.     It had already  been
shown,m another pUce, that the entire receipts of
money from the whole public domain, up to the
30th September 1839, were       - 1116,198,179 15
During the five years commencing
with the   1st of January, 1833,
and ending with the 31st of De-
cember,   1837,  thote   receipts

Thus leaving the gross receipts of
of the remaing forty years to
amount but to the sum of       - $56950,753 06
Being less than the amount re-
ceived in the five years covered
by these first four land bills, by
the sum of                                    $2,296,673 03
If, then, the sum received by the States under the
deposite law ot 1836, was gieater than the nett pro-
ceeds of the lands lor these five years, ii will not be
pretended  that any other five years could have
b'en, or can now be selected, which will produce a
more favorable result for the distribution interests.
A comparison from ihe  records will establish the
fallowing  facts      The   expenses  of the General
Land Ofhce, of the local land offices, of the Sur-
veyor General's  offices, of surveys, including all
salaries, commissions, and contingent expenses of
commissions to  setll-  land claims, and the  five
per cent to the new Slates, for the five years from
1833 to 1837 inclusive, amounted to #5,368,843 70
The amount actually expended in
the   Indian   Department during
the same five years, as aseertam-
ed from the appropriations and
accounts   exclusive   of  Indian
war , and the suppression of In-
dian hostilities, was       -           - 18,743,314 93
The value of Indian annuities cre-
ated, and stipulated by treaties to
be paid, during that five years, es-
timating  the annuities for terms
of years at their actual amount,
those for life at twenty-one years,
and those which are perpetual as
a Capital which, invested at five
per cent, will produce the annu-
ities, was          -           -           -   5,933,400 00
The value of the annuit es resting
as a charge upon the lands at the
commencement of the five years,
and which could not produce nett
proceeds  until those debts we e
discharged, was             -           -    6,675,675 00
The amount of the money paid to
ihe States under the deposite act
of 1836, was    -         .         . 28,101,644 97

Senate.
These sums together, make a to-
tal of    -           -           -           - 64,822,878 60
The gross receipts from the lands
for the five years, as has been
shown, amounted to      -           - 59,247,426 09
Thus showing a deficiercy in the re-
ceipts to meet the payments for
account of the lands fur Ihe pe-
riod, to discharge the liabilities
contracted for and resting upon
the lands, and to make the pa>-
ments to the States, which were
actually made under the deposite
act, of the sum of          -           - $5,575,452 51
These charges and payments, for the five years,
may seem larf e, and they are so; but it must not
be forgotten that, while we «old lands rapidly dur-
ing that inflated and speculating period, we also
purchased rapidly fiom the Indians; and an ex-
amination of the transactions of the Government
will ihow that more Indian title was extinguished,
and a giea er number of Indians were removed
wtstof the Mississippi, during the period in ques-
tion, iban in any other period of equal length, if
not more than ever previously. It may be supposed
that the foutth item in the statement, that for the
annuities existing previously to the commencement
of the five years, is improperly charged in the ac-
count It is not easy to ^ee how the lands could
be satd, with truth, to produce nett proceeds for
distribution, while debfe, legally and equitably
chargeable upon them, debts contracted for their
purchase, remained unpa d, but if this item be
mistaken, pno'her of a les., amount, the annual
current annuities for the five years, should unques-
tionably be substituted They would make an
amountrf $1,668 918 75 foi the period in ques-
tion, and such a change in the statement would
still leave a deficiency in the fund to meet the pay-
ments of #568,696 26 In any shape, therefore,
in which the comparison can be made, the sum
paid to the States was more than the nett proceeds
of the lands would have given them for the period
which has been examined.
The later land bills proposed to make the distri-
bution for the five years commencing with 1837
and ending with 1841, and although they prescribed
a rule, and, as he thought, one most erroneous and
unjust to the Treasury, for determining what
should be considered nett proceeds, yet under those
bills and that rule the States could not have re-
ceived any thing like ihe sum which has been paid
to them under the deposite act. Indeed it does not
now seem likely that the whole gross proceeds cf
the «ales for these five years will reach the amount
so paid over to the Sta'es. It was not his intention
to enter into any discussion now as to the charac-
ter of those payments and whether they were to be
viewed in the light of deposites or dis nbutions.
When the bill was on its passage, which authorized
the payments to be made, he attempted to show
that they would be distributions in effect, if they
were not in form, and he believed all would now
admit that such was likely to be the result
A single remark further under this head, and he
would indulge what seemed to be the wish of the
Senate, by yielding to a motion to adjourn. It
should not escape attention that, in all these state-
ments and compansens, nothing has been taken
from the proceeds of the lands to be applied to the
debt of the Revolution, to the payment of which it
is said they were pledged by the S ates; nothing to
pay the Revolutionary pension , in equity certainly
a part of the Revolutionary debt, and for several
years last past amounting to some three millions
per annum; nothing to pay the expenses of Indian
wars prosecuted for the recovery and protection of
these lands, and two of which, within the five
years from 1833 lo 1837 inclusive, took from the
National Treasury probably not less than twenty
millions of dollars.
Here the Senate adjourned.
Thursdat, January 28 —Mr. Wright said, if be
had succeed in making himself understood yester-
day, it would be recollected that he sought to esta-
lish the general position that the proposition now be-
fore the Senate, to distribute the proceeds of the
public lands to the States, was, m principle, identi-
