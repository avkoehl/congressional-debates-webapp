press, though he found gentlemen who had written and spoken
on the subject entertained a different opinion
They had been told that, like every other department of the
Government, they were the Representatives of the States, and
he believed the converse of that proposition had been taken—
that they were one confederacy which overrode and bioke
down eveiy conflicting interest But did they find one solitary
allusion in the Constitution to them but as the Repiespnta
uves of-States? The Constitution said, "Representatives
and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several
States" <fcc And in the election of President and \ice
President by Congress, they weie a luded to as the Repre
eentatives of Sutes That bung conceded, that they were the
Representatives of the States, and not of the aggregate peo
pie of this Union, what elected them? The Constitution was
not silent on that point Toe second section of article second
said "The House of Representatives shall be composed of
members chosen every second year by the people of the seve
ral States " If, then the people of the S ates were to elect
them, what right had Congiess to say that a district only should
elect? for it couhl not be an election by aSta'e, it a fiaction only
voted. To illustrate that position, he would ask what they
meant when they spoke of the people of the District of Co
lumbia? Did they mean Georgetown or Alexandua, as contra
distinguished from each other? When they spoke of the peo
pie of Virginia, did they speak of Richmond or Williamsburg
alone? VV hen they spoke of France, did they speak of Bordeaux,
Paris, or Marseilles? They must see at once, tfiat by an ex
juession of this sort, they meant the whole people, and they had
no right to say thata fraction of the people shall elect Thenght
was given to the people by the f tamers of the Constitution to
vote for their Representatives, ard any attempt to abridge that
right was an abridgment of the right of the citizen
Suppose a State entitled to five Representatives, for which
the people, by the Constituiion, were authorized to vote, if thev
by a statute law, should say that the voter should vote but foi
one, did they not deprive him of four fifths o*" his rights and
by that amount abridge the elective franchise? And if they
could deprive him of tour filths of his lights coui 1 they not go
a step further, an) depuvc >- i ui the whole? He granted thnt
Congress might altei the State lezulatious as to the time piare
and manner of holding the elections, bu that did not conflict
with the right of every votei to vote for eveiy member foi a
State They harmoni7ed with each n her if C ingiess s mply
regulated time, place, and mannei 01 holding the electio s
whether they were held by acncuit judge 01 a county judge a
sheriff01 a marshal But a« well mignt they claim the pjwei
to establish a bank r\ the i ower to regulate commeice as o
claim the authority n >w contended ior uridei the power to wh ch
allusion had been made
His views were tha' they ha I rl power lindel th  Constltu
tion to district the Rtates foi amther leason By tne exeioi=e
ofsuchpowei, they would not only abud"e the nghtof the citi
zen, but they went fur her and abridged the qualif cauon of the
Representative, and pre cri led a new < ne 'or the member hi in
self Now,heask d if they coudilo indirectly v hat they could
not do directly? They could t it pieseiibe a new qtialificatii n
by statute but they indirectly did it by districting the Stales
Thequa'ificationoi Representative p e cnbed bv the Cons nu
tion was, that he shall have attained to the ?ge of twnty five
yeare, and been seven years a ciuz n of the United States, and
when elected, shall be an inhabitant of the State in which he
shall be chosen These were all the qualifications required by
the Constitution, but they were about to require, by th s amend
ment, that each member should live in a paitieular section of a
State Now, he hoped Congress wou'd not attempt to do that
indirectly which they could not do directly
Again all the power which regarded the selection of Repre
sentatives applied also to the election of Senators except is to
the place of election The gentleman from Georgia the other
day asked if they could draw a line through the State and say
that one Senator should be elected foi one section ol the State
so divided, and the other foi the other section and it appeared
that the answer would be that the) could draw no such line
because the Sena oí s were elected by the Repiesentatives of the
people m the State I cgislaturea And hew were ra mbers of
Congress elected? Why, if the Constitution meant any thing
by the people Then could they i ot just as well elect a senator
foradistrict marked by a htisionline Irawn thiough the State
as to say that the Representatives of the people there should be
limited to districts'! There was not the slightest difference so
far as the Con ti ution vías correined one was an election by
the people as a Thole people and the olhei by the Legislatui
of tie S ate and the question between the two stood on a most
perfect equality
But suppose that Congress had the power was it propet that
Congress should exeic se it? Had tho e circums'ancrs an=en
which were contemplated by the fi amere of the Constitution'
Had any State of this Confeth racy refused to discharge its du y
to elect Representatives to this body? Not one V, hy then,
take up this power? Could it be posslblethat the party which
sorecently swept over this landhke awhitlwmd was dissatis
fied with its position? Wert they conscious of receding powei,
and was tins an a tempt to perpetuate n? Could that be the
obiect' Was tha' to be done at this Congress' He wonl 1 tell
the gentlemen, if such were then intentions, tha' th ir atten pt
would be futile, and he would also remind them that 'whom
the cods wish to destroy, they first make mad " I ft them go
onandaddtothem°aeure of thelt unwise act  and the de
structionof Iuciler, when he was hurel fiom the highest
Heaven, would not be more signal than theirs
If then those gentlemen would be advised hy him they
would fail to add thi  extiaouhn try act to tho e they have al
readv done in thisbody B it anions other strongob,ec ions to
the districting of the « ates by this Government there was this
that they would increase tho legislation of Const ss thiee fo d
for every Congress to be hereaf'ei elected would also take it up
Tnev might d?st 'ct tl e Sta os to day because usuitedthemter
ests of tlie dominant party, i d,) erlmps, the nex Congie=s
would undertake to c«tal lish the general ticket system an >-
 Xd was such legislan m n't. ssary?   Would it add t<
. he
.sary' would it aaa to the
stability of thi  Republic" W t uld it result in gool toanv poi
Son of the confedera  ? It would not, and they should not
Xnt.it If this principle was adopted by th Congress in
teadof coming here to legislate fo. the whole Repub'ic the.,
successor  would have in their eve their own security and the
nartv m power would seek u ru petuate its own existence, and
w sink those that were opposed to them m paity politic , and
instead of being a deliberative body f 1 the tra «action of th 
<■ business, they wou'd find it a corrupt, degrading, vitiated
publi"
place, in which there would be one universal scramble for pow
er.
What, then, was the argument used by the gentleman from
South Carolina and others in favor of the adoption of this sys-
tem? Why it was that the smaher Stafes might be pritected
against the greater States But did they beiieve that the larger
States deemed it necessai y to adopt the general ticket system
to accomplish any great object ? Did they believe that any ac
tion of the smaller States could precipitate oi prevent the action
of the larger States 1 No, but there was something more ndic
ulous in the argument toan all this, and tlie gentleman's argu
mems reminded him ofthe Lilliputians binding Gulliver, who,
as soon as he awoke, srapped the bonds with which he was
bourd It was just as ridiculous to talk of the small Slates
binding the large ones here, for whenever the large States chose
to act, they would do so, and in what did they rely to control
the action of the large State  Í In the first place, m their sense
of moral right Where next ? In the conflicting interests in
those ¡states themselves But if these weie found too powerless
to control them where next lay security? In the other end of
th° Capitol, and perhaps at the other end ofthe avenue, it might
be found, especially if a bank should be projected, and he
thanked God that it was so There was the security of the
small States provided they could not find it in the diversified in
terests of the large States, and in their own sense of moral right,
and th s was one of the beauties of our system—that a minority
can be efficiently protected
Would, then, the dominant party force this measure upon
them? He trusted not, butif they were determined todo it,
let them remember that the day of reckoning may come They
could not much longer remain in power the whole historv of
the Government had proved *t They possessed power row,
but if they disregarded all the obligations of justice, and ever
cised their powei with tyranny, a different policy would soon
prevail Public sentiment had declared that they could not
much longer hold this Government, and, as with a change of
Administration there would be a change of policy, he resisted
the adoption, and protested against the passage of this amend
ment to th11 bill
Mi B \RN 4RD after observing that the propo Hion now
hefoie the committee had been mtioduced by one of the
s an ling committees of the House chaiged with the con
si lerationof thu subject, said, that, if for no other, fntlusreason,
it was entitled to the calm consideia on ofthe House hat it
wis a new proposition, ths being the first time he believed,
11 the lustor} ol the Government, when it had been m induced
to t le cons derat on of Congress that it was a subject of deep
merest and importance to the country, an I, after bespeaking
for it a calm and delibeiate con ideiation such as it had re
ceived m the august assemblies which framed and which ra i
fed the Constitution, pioceeded to remark that thepioposition
was, mat the Representatives m Congiess should b° elected
herealter by districts—a s ngle Representative ft r a tingle (lis
tuct—referí mg to the several States to make provision foi such
eke i n  What was the provision ot ihe Cinsii utionon this
sujjectl That the ' times, places and napnci of holding elec
ton  toi Senators and R pieeentativ eg shall be pteecubed in
each Sta c by the Legislature thereof, but the Congress may at
any time by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to
the places of choosing Senators "
The first observation he had to make on thispiovision of the
Constituiion was, that the whole power over thesubjea was
granted by this clause It was a grant of full and plenary
pov er over aparticular subject, viz thetime place, and man
i er o holding elections for henators and Representatives On
•wl omwas this power conferred? Firston the States of this
lirion Had the States any power overthissubjec', except that
derived from this clause of the Constitution? Could any man
contend they had' If they had, where did they get that power?
Was it the original power ofthe ¡states to piovide foi the times,
piares, and manner of holding elections for another Govern
ment? The p iwer could not exist in the States oefore the ex
istence of the Government, and it was the Constitution of the
Unite 1 Slates that biought this Government into existence It
seemed to h m absurd to suppose that any powei ovei this sub
ject could exist in the seveial ¡states except as conferred on
them by this clause of the Constitution This was an mdepen
dent Government—of hmi ed powers he granted—restricted to
the powers confeired on it by tht Cons itution, and indepen
dentlv existing fiom the moment of the adoption of this Con
stuution, without the leave or license of the States or any othei
Government on earth What other Government—either the
fe ates or any foieign Government— had a right to nterfere
with the manner oi the election of independent ofilt crs of this
m lepen lent Gieernment,which derived its existence fiom the
Constitution? No such power existed n the States They
were, if > ou please, absolute sovereignties previous to the foi in
ation of the t onstitution but, as such, had no,sjch power
whatever a  wis here confened on them by this 0 irsl tution
It follow-t then, th it the authority which tl e States of the
Union 1 ad over this subject, whatevei it might be, was gianted
by theConsti nlion in the clause uistiead The onl} power
over cMs sibjectwas given by this cltuse of the Constituiion
A power was not only by this clause given to the States, but a
full and 1 enary power
If the •sta es had a full and p'caaty power "iven tofhem by
this clause of the Constitution then th s Government had tl e
same power given *o it He conceded that this pow er on the part
of the Government was not to be exercised except in certain
rases He did not believe it was the intention ofthe Consti u
tion that this Government should exercise this power except
when 'he S ale  neglected or refused fo p rform it at all oi to
pei form it in a manner satisfactoiv to this Government Tie
poweis of this Government and ol the states were ongn al
pot' eis and concurrent po veis, and the power of this Govern
ment was a powei of revision appellatea wcllason ma!,and
it had a perfect light to review every thing theStates did or this
subject an 1 if they saw fit, to correct it It was impossible for
him to imagine how any man could argue ihat any power was
given to the States on the subject, which was not also given, in
certain cucumstances, to this Government Whaiever, there
foie, the powei of theStates might do, the power of this Gov
eminent might review, tevine, and correct, when it saw cause
for correction
In his opinion the time had come when, in consequence of
the manner m which some ofthe Slates of the Union bad per
form this dutv, it was the dutv of Congress to mterfer  in
this mater It was ptoposed bv this amendment to cor
rect the proceedings or the States m one single particular \ ery
strenuous opposition had been made in some quarters of this
Hall to this proposition, on the ground that this Government
was undertaking, by this pioseeding, to order the sovereign;
States to do certain things, and gentlemen had warned them to
take care how they brought this Government into conflict
with the. Sutes Let him remind the genilemen that they or
dered nothing, they passed such a law as they had a right to pass,
providing that the manner ol holding elections si ould be bv pis
tncts, and not by general ticket, and it remained (or the States
to perform their duty under the Cm stitution If any body* or
any thing, gave order to the States, it was the Constitulior, ana
yet gentlemen complained about an order fiom this Govern-
ment or the States Both this Government and the States were
servants of one common master and here >t is, (said Mr B )
[holding up a copy ofthe Corstitution ]
He knew very well it had been said, aid the ground strongjy
taken in debate, that the States might divide their population
into districts, for the purpose ol electing Repre entanves to
Congress, but that this Government could not, and that the
States should elect by the whole body ( f the people voting fot
their Representatives The plain conclusion from this argu-
ment would be that every individual who hel 1 his seat elected
by the general district system was here without auihonty
That would be the inevitable conclusion iftheCon minion was
clear that every Representative mu&the voielfor bv he people
of the States at laige In order to getnd ol his it flu  ly, ho
had understood the eentleman from Georgia [Mr Colclitt] to
make a distinction between the power of the States on this st b
jectand the powerof the General Giveinmei t Tha' was an
argument to the effect that the States rnie,ht violate the Consti-
tution, and this Government might no because the same clausf 
gave the power to both
It was a fallacy to say that the ncessary consequence was,
that if all the States should elect by the d slrict =ystcm, and not
by tho general ticket system, the Representante must lesutr in.
that district by which he was elected It was no r ecessary con
sequence If the practice of electing a Rcpiocntativebv one
district who Jived in another dntr c had pievailrd in t o other
State, it had in New York The common f tct was he granted,
and it was one of the excellences of th sjjiem, I hat ihe Repre
sentatlve should be a resident of the i'istTJrt bv which he was
elected but there was no assumption ol authority whatever m
