Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the enemy were perfectly quiet last night and until about 5 o'clock to-day, when they ventured to fire six shell, all of which burst among their own pickets. At the first shot we opened with one 8-inch mortar and the light 12-pounder gun, causing them to cease firing inside of forty minutes. Men are healthy; everything seems satisfactory. Am anxious to have more spherical case sent for the 12-pounder gun.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
