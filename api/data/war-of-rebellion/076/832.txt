NASHVILLE, TENN., September 8, 1864-11.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Dispatches from General Rousseau, at Athens, received this evening, state that Wheeler with all his force, excepting Williams' division, is west of Tennessee and Alabama Railroad, in vicinity of Rogersville, near Tennessee River. Monday Rousseau defeated Wheeler badly at Campbellsville, from whence he retreated to Lawrenceburg, where part of Rousseau's force attacked him on Tuesday morning, routing him again. Colonel Streight has gone toward Rogersville with 2,500 infantry and two pieces of artillery. Granger is also moving against Wheeler with infantry. General Rousseau this afternoon, with cavalry and artillery, moved toward Rogersville from Athens. General Steedman is said to be at Pulaski with 3,000 infantry. Rousseau's dispatch states that Roddey has joined Wheeler. Doolittle telegraphs from Decatur, Roddey has returned to Courtland. Milroy is pursuing Williams with about 1,600 cavalry, a force equal to Williams'. Nothing heard from Milroy of Williams for two days. Milroy was then moving on Williams from Columbia, Williams going eastward after failing to join Wheeler. Milroy whipped Williams at Triune, and can do it again anywhere. Everything seems to be working well. Great joy over the capture of Atlanta.

The rebel force referred to in your telegram of the 7th passed through Beech Grove yesterday in the direction of McMinnville. We think Dibrell has gone in the same direction.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Thomas J. Jordan, Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry, with 550 men, surprised, attacked, and routed Dibrell's brigade of 2,000 men at Readyville, killing 25, wounding many, capturing 130; our loss, 1 killed, 5 wounded, 4 missing. To-day the railroad was torn up near Bell Buckle; damage trifling. The bridge across Stewart's Creek, the only one injured by Wheeler, is rebuilt. The road will be repaired to-day. If Wheeler should start direct for Chattanooga he would be outstripped by a train from Nashville.
