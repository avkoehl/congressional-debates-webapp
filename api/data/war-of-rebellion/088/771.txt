Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: My lookout near the Gibbon house reports a strong detail of the enemy, about 2,000, at work this afternoon throwing up a line of works running off at a small angle from the vicinity of the main line near the plank road, and leading through the woods in direction of the lead-works, or perhaps a little to the right of them. The officer at plank road station reports:

The enemy are working by heavy detail on a new line of works in our immediate front and on another line by edge of woods north-northwest from station. They are working on our whole front, but with less force than on new line. They are also extending works on our extreme left beyond the Weldon railroad. During the forenoon about 1,000 men, in three detachments, moved southward along the Weldon railroad. They came from the woods west of the fort in that vicinity.

The following messages were intercepted:
