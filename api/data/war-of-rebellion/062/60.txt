Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

A few prisoners of war taken from Stand Watie, formerly conscripted, are anxious to take the oath of allegiance and not be compelled to go to Saint Louis. Can the provost-marshal relieve them upon their taking the oath? Loyal citizens certify that they were loyal men before they were conscripted.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., January 11, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. W. BISHOP,Fayetteville, Ark.:

Paragraph 1 of General Orders, No. 3, current series, is as follows:

I. Lieutenant-Colonel Bishop, First Arkansas Cavalry, is, at his own request, hereby relieved from duty as chief of cavalry. District of Southwest Missouri, and will report to his regiment for duty.

This order has been approved at department headquarters. Colonel Harrison will be detained here nine or ten days on court-martial. You will therefore have full command of all troops about Fayetteville, and will immediately move the largest portion of the mounted troops, including artillery, that can with prudence possibly be spared from Fayetteville, to guard forage wagons east and southeast, disposing of the troops in two or tree bodies or battalions in such a manner that each will be able to support the other and protect the road and telegraph line as fully as they now do. I will issue full orders before Harrison returns. You may expect to retain command in the field for some time. Inform me of all your movements; look daily after forage, and see that all Government animals are fully supplied.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Part of Colorado troops had got to Independence. All stopped. I am collecting to get it with me if I go to the field.
