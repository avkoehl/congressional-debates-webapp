So the amendment was rejecud. |
The question was next on the amendment of-
fered by tiie gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Alli- <
son] above reported. i
'I'he arm ndment was agreed to. |
The lall was ordered to be engrossed and road [
a t'nrd time. i
M:. HOLM AN called for tiie reading of the j
Ht.^lOfcSt il bill. I
Tim SPEAKER. The bill is not yet en- j
grossed. The hill will go to the Speaker's table.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 move to reconsider the
vole by which the bill was ordered to be en-
grossed .
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I move to
lay the motion on the table.
Mr. WILSON demanded the yeas and nivs.
Mr. STEVENS. I withdraw the motion.
Mr. BROOKS. 1 renew the motion.
NAVY-YAXID AT CAIKO, ILLINOIS.
The SPEAKER. The motion will be entered
on the Journal. The business next in older is
the unfinished business of the Committee on Naval
Affairs, being the joint resolution in reference to it
navy-yard for iron-ciads in the western wateia.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The chair-
man of the Committee on Naval Affair? is not
present. I offer as an amendment to the joint
resolution the bill on the same subject passed by
the Senate.
Air. W. J". ALLEN. I suggest to my col-
league to ask to have that bill taken from the
Speaker's table and put upon its passage.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. 1 adopt that
suggestion.
There being no objection, Senate bill No. 190,
to establish a navy-yard and depot at Cairo, m
the State of Illinois, was taken from the Sneak-
er's table, and read a first and second time.
Mr. WILSON. I rise to a question of order,
that the bill contains an appropriation, and it
must first be considered in the Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. That point
of'order comes too late.
The SPEAKER. The point of order the Chair
thinks comes too lute. This bill was by geneial
consent substituted for the House bill.
Mr. WILSON. 1 rose as soon as the bill was
read, and could not know that it contained an
appiopriation until it was read.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that
the matter came up in the first place as unfimahed
business. The suggestion was made very audi-
bly to the House that the Senate biil should be
taken up instead of the House bill. The ques-
tion was put to the House, and no objection was
made. Tiie Chair thinks, although the bill had
not been rend, as it was taken up by unanimous
consent it is now too late to raise an objection.
Mr. WILSON, i move to lay the bill un the
table.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The gen-
tleman will have to wait until he gets the floor
before he makes that motion.
LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
On motion of Mr. GOOCi 1 j by unanimous con-
sent, leave of absence was granted for two days
to All. lis ok, of Massachusetts.
NAVAL B&P0T.
Mr. FENTON. With the leave of tiie gentle-
man from Illinois, I desue to know how, m ac-
cordance with his practice, that gentleman can
possibly vote to expend all this money. I under-
stood him to say the other day in the House that
he would not consent to spend any money of the
Government that wa^ not absolutely necessary.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Thatispte-
ciseiy my line of legislation, and this legislation is
precisely in that line. It the gentleman from New
York is as consistent, i do not think lus leputa-
uon will suffer.
Mr. FENTON. I do not anticipateany dam-
age to my reputation in comparison to that tiie
gentleman from Illinois vvol suffer in advocating
this bill
Mr. SPALDING. I ask tiie gentleman to yield
to me for a moment.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I will yield
to the gentleman presently.
Mr. Speaker, the proposition which the House
has now befoie it is one which has been consid-
ered most elaborately hy the Seriate, and which
passed that body with only three dissenting votes.
1 need not tell the House what eveiy member
here must know, that the establishment of a naval
depot on the Mississippi river or some of its trib-
utaries is absolutely i a rcrf.tuiry. It is well known
that we have some three or four hundred nav.tl
vessels on that river; we are building mote, and
there must be some place for repairs to be made.
Everybody, 1 believe, agrees to the proposition
that we must have a naval depot on tiie Missis-
sippi nvt r.
Now the only question which arises is, as to
the best method of establishing it, and as to ihe
point to be selected. The proposition ofiheNaval
Committee of the House was to uuthoijze the ap-
