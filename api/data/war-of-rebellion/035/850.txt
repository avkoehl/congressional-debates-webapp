sary or might be called for. I have always held myself and command in readiness to afford aid, and keep three regiments camped at Guy's Gap, so as to be as near as possible to the cavalry headquarters. All I require is an intimation from the officer in command that there is danger, and support is needed, and I will move without waiting for orders.

I would respectfully suggest that there ought to be an infantry brigade on outpost on the Middleton road or between that and the old Nashville road, and I desire to call especial attention to this suggestion.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. P. STEWART,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded.

I don't know what this is in answer to, as I have seen no note pass my office to General Stewart for information.

Major-General, C. S. Army.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Numbers 120. Tullahoma, Tenn., May 23, 1863.

The principal fort at Tullahoma is named and will be known as Fort Rains. It is so named by the commanding general in honor of Brigadier General James E. Rains, a gallant son of Tennessee, who fell on the field of Murfreesborough, in that heroic discharge of duty, defending his State.

By command of General Bragg:

H. W. WALTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SHELBYVILLE, VIA CHATTANOOGA,

May 24, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

It is unsafe, if not impracticable, to keep captured negroes in depot at McMinnville. At Chattanooga they could be most usefully employed as laborers, relieving the same number of soldiers.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

[Indorsement.]

MAY 25, 1863.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War, with the request that General Bragg be authorized to carry out his suggestion.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
