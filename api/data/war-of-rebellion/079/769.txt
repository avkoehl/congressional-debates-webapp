Brigadier General R. DELAFIELD,

Chief Engineer U. S. Army:

GENERAL: Inclosed I have the honor to forward my report of operations, dated yesterday, for the year ending 30th June, 1864. I regret exceedingly the delay of its submission, but my time being very much taken up in filling the requisitions for supplies for the armies in the field, occasionally visiting the forts in Kentucky, and the maps not before being ready, I have not been able to submit the report till now.

The maps, plans, profiles, &amp;c., referred to in Appendix A of the report, I have forwarded to-day by Adams Express Company, and will be found contained in the three tin cases and one portfolio. *

I am, general, very respectfully,

DEFENSES OF COVINGTON, NEWPORT, AND CINCINNATI.

On February 9, 1863, I forwarded to the Bureau of Topographical Engineers a copy of my report on these defenses, which I had submitted previously on November 27, 1862, to Major General H. G. Wright, commanding the Department of the Ohio. I submitted at the same time to the Bureau tracings of map and plans of the fortifications. For general description of the topographical features of the line of defense and discussion of the subject, see report referred to. By reference to that report it will be noticed that at that date the fortifications were not entirely finished and several new works and improvements were suggested. I have now to report that the works then proposed, and since found to be essential, were almost entirely completed by the end of the year 1863. These now works and improvements embrace as follows, and their illustrations will be noticed by reference to the map of
