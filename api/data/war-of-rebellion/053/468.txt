Major-General HOOKER:

The general commanding has sent a number of animals, which the

scarcity of forage will not permit us to retain at this place, under charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Sympson, quartermaster, en route to Nashville, where they can be properly cared for. He directs that these animals be sent from Stevenson on the empty cars returning to Nashville, and that they be shipped as soon as practicable after their arrival, that they may not consume what little forage there is in and about Stevenson.

I am, sir, very respectfully,C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Your brigade at Stevenson will be returned to Bridgeport as soon as one from the Twelfth Corps can arrived to relieve it; probably Monday morning.

Major-General HOWARD,Commanding Eleventh Corps, Bridgeport, Ala.:

The Eightieth Illinois, now under command of Brig. General J. D. Morgan, at Battle Creek, has no transportation, and cannot move with the remainder of Morgan's command. The general commanding has therefore ordered it to report to you for temporary duty. The regiment is small and has but three or four officers with it, the remainder being prisoners at Richmond. The regiment was captured last number, and the officers have never been exchanged.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
