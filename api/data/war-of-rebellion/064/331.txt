forty-eight hours, they cannot follow the Indians with any hope of overtaking them. I wish you would order me to pursue them until I do overtake them or something definite.

Yours, in haste,

Captain, Commanding Camp Dunn.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo. Ter., June 12, 1864.

Captain J. C. DAVIDSON,

First Cavalry of Colorado:

Yours of this date received. When that order was written it was thought the Indians were encamped within a few miles of your command, and that forty-eight hours would be sufficient to overtake, kill, and return. Use your own discretion in regard to following the Indians, but do not delay a moment longer than there appears to be a prospect of success.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. S. MAYNARD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

With regard to subject of your telegram of the 4th instant to General Meigs, the supply of stock and materials for the repair of the railroad from Vicksburg to Monroe, I am directed by the Secretary of War to say that the expediency of the expense is so much doubted as that it has been referred to Lieutenant General U.
