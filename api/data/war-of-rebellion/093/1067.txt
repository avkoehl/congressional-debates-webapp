Colonel H. CAPRON,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL; Since seeing Captain Boynton, acting assistant adjutant-general on your staff, orders have been received for the corps to move. You will get your command in readiness to march as soon as possible, and will move it to the crossing of the Lewisburg and Nashville pike with Duck River, find the whereabouts of the battalion sent out there last night, and dispatch a strong party in support of it. You may start as soon as you get ready to move, but if you find General Hatch's division on the road, you must wait for him to pass, as his division has the head of the column. The corps is ordered to go into camp five or six miles from this place, moving out by the first road leading eastward from the Columbia and Nashville pike. You will thus know the general locality of the command. Instruct the patrols on the river south of this of your destination and destination of the Cavalry Corps.

This by order of Brigadier-General Johnson:
