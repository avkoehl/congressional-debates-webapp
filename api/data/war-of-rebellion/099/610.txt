GENERAL: I am directed by the general commanding to transmit herewith a copy of a note* just received from Major-General Howard relative to the advanced position occupied by the Seventeenth corps and to invite your attention to the imperative necessity of effecting a crossing of Lynch's Creek with your whole command at the earliest moment practicable consistent with the preservation of your ammunition and subsistence.

HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Lynch's Creek, S. C., February 28, 1865.

Major MAX WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that my division has remained in the position occupied by it on the evening of the 26th instant. Most of my train, as you are aware, being cut off from the division by the high water, is the reason for its remaining in bivouac. I have had heavy details at work on the road during the entire day, making it passable for my trains, and shall attempt to cross them at 8 p.m. I have pushed my mounted foraging details well to the front, and from different reports learn that no very important force of the enemy eihter threatens or is in close proximity to my front, but that a force simply sufficient to watch our movements is in this vicinity.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brevet Major-General.
