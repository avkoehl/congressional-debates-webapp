strong reason to apprehend that it was intended that you should cross to-day at 9 a. m. I am momentarily expecting a telegram. I wish that you would send a staff officer to Banks' Ford to read all telegraphic dispatches there. Hold your command in readiness to spring, in case this should prove an error and it is indented you should cross to-day at 9 o'clock, to move to that point as rapidly as possible, to cross.
