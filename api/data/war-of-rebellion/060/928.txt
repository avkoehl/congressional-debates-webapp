furnish me with copies of such orders and instructions as it may be necessary for me to know, in order to have my command properly in readiness for the duty required of it? I have no orders relative to the amount of transportation allowed to the regiments and batteries. I am not informed as to organization of the supply trains. I have no definite orders in regard to the organization of the pioneer and engineer corps. I do not like to give any orders affecting these organizations, from fear of interfering with some orders that may have been already given from department headquarters, and with which I am not acquainted.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 20, 1864.

General AVERELL:

We cannot make any charge in regard to the First Virginia and Fourteenth Pennsylvania, as this would defer the movement and would be contrary to my proposition to General Grant. I am very sorry, and would like to have you and your cavalry at Martinsburg, but under the present circumstances I cannot do what pleases me best. Please telegraph to me from all your stations.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 20, 1864.

(Received 1.40 p. m.)

Major-General STAHEL:

I am just notified by railroad agent that transportation for the cavalry and an infantry regiment is ready at Webster and Clarksburg. Tell General Averell to make his arrangements and to order what cavalry he wants to embark at Clarksburg.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 20, 1864.

Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:

General Grant has ordered other disposition. Please take the first train eastward to-day, and I shall take the first train westward to meet you at Oakland. Acknowledge receipt.

JUL. STAHEL.

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 20, 1864.

General AVERELL:

We would gain no time by meeting at Oakland. I will go to Grafton or you come up, to be here at 10 a. m. Please answer what you prefer.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.
