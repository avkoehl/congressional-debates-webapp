Fayetteville Prairie Grove, Cane Hill, Dutchtown, and to the Arkansas River, half way between Forts Gibson and Smith. On November the 9th, after the pursuit had been abandoned and the division broken up, the Second Brigade marched for Fort Smith with Major-General Blunt. Remained at Fort Smith awaiting forage and rations until the 19th, when the march was taken up for this place. Arrived at Fort Gibson on the 23d, remained one day to feed hay, marched for Fort Scott. Met on the south bank of Neosho a large supply train going south. Said with it one day, as reports had been received that the rebel Generals Cooper and Gano had crossed the Arkansas River for the purpose of capturing it. Sent out Major Ross with every horse able to walk to reconnoiter; found no enemy and returned. Marched the following day via the Catholic Mission for grazing purposes in the Neosho bottom. Arrived in Fort Scott December 7. Remained two days to recruit animals; arrived in Paola December 12, having been absent exactly two months. During one-half of this time not more than one-fourth forage could be obtained, so that with the continuous and rapid marches a very great many horses have been abandoned as well as a great many killed in battle.

In conclusion, I desire to call the attention of the department to the uniform gallantry and efficiency of the following named officers, who came prominently under my immediate observation and who behaved themselves throughout the entire campaign in a manner worthy of special mention, viz, Lieutenant-Colonel Plumb and Majors Anderson and Ross, battalion commanders of the Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry; Surgeon Ainsworth and Assistant Surgeon Adams, Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, in charge of medical department, and Captain Young, Fifth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, acting assistant quartermaster and acting commissary of subsistence from the tim he joined the command. The campaign was an unusually severe one, marching day and night, with often little or no rations, yet every officer and soldier bore up under the difficulties and hardships without ever grumbling, ever prompt and obedient. To lieutenant and regimental adjutant* Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, my acting assistant adjutant-general I am especially indebted for his zeal, activity, and vigilance, and I earnestly recommend him to the department for promotion in the adjutant-general's department. I cannot close without mentioning the following enlisted men to whom special praise is due for their services on the battle-fields as aides; I had none other, nor could I have had better, viz: Sergt. Major I. H. Isbell, Quartermaster Sergt. W. H. Cowan, Chief Bugler N. D. Horton, all of the Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry. These non-commissioned officers well merit promotion. I had forgotten to mention that Lieutenant W. F. Goble, Company L, Fifth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, served in the brigade from the beginning as battalion adjutant for Colonel Plumb and is reported by him as being an officer of uniform good conduct and high standing. The following is a list of casualties during the campaign.+ Forty-five horses were killed and 272 abandoned.
