General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

C. S. Army, Charleston, S. C.:

DEAR GENERAL: I received a few days since your letter of the 24th ultimo, and will direct the investigation you desire. I think it more than probable, however, tht the letter you refer to was really captured by some of Buell's scouts. About the time you mention {September 10) General Jordan, who was at Catoosa Springs, sent to me at Chattanooga a letter addressed to General Bragg. On the upper right corner of the envelope were the letters G. T. B., all in Jordan's handwriting.
