The PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Sen-

the Senate to order.
The Chaplain of the Senate for the Thirty-
Ninth Congress, Rev. Edgar H. Gray, D.D.,
of Washington, opened the proceedings with
the following
prayer.
0 God, from everlasting to everlasting Thou
art God. Men die, but Thou livest evermore.
Governments change, but Thy dominion is an
everlasting dominion. Senates and Legisla-
tures and councils cease, but the Triune Coun-
cil of the great God continues and holds on
through all the cycles of eternity. We thank
Thee that Thou hast given us such a great
country in trust; that it has become the asy-
lum for the oppressed and the home of the free.
We thank Thee for a Government so free that
every citizen may participate in its privileges
and blessings ; so just that the rights of every
individual shall be respected ; so stable that
though Cabinets and councilsand Senates cease,
yet it holds on in its grand principles and cardi-
nal doctrines. We thank Thee for Thy goodness
and mercy which have been extended toward
the members of this body and of both Houses
of Congress during the last session. 0 God,
we bless Thee that the lives and health of so
many of the Senators have been continued
unto them, and that the Thirty-NinthCongress
has closed up so favorably, and the Fortieth is
inaugurated so auspiciously.
Now, we invoke the Divine blessing to be
upon this body, upon Thy servant who has just
been selected to preside over all of its delib-
erations. Give him strength; give him wis-
dom ; give him grace; and grant that the good
hand of Thy providence may be upon every
Senator, upon those who have long been serv-
ing their country, and upon those who are just ;
to assume the duties and the responsibilities j
of Senators. God, grant to be with them and |
protect every member of this body in his life 1
and strength during the sessions of this Con- i
gress : and let Thy blessing be upon both J
Houses, and grant to preside over the delib- ;
erations of both and guide them to wise meas- \
ures and wise enactments. Let Thy blessing 1
rest upon the President and upon the members
of the Cabinet, and let Thy blessing be upon
the judges in our courts and upon the Army
and the Navy, the defenders of our country,
and upon the people. Slay we be a people
whose God is the Lord. Have all the interests
40th Cong. 1st Sess.—No. 1.
and institutions of this country in Thy safe
care and keeping; and grant to hedge about
us as a people, to defend us from the pestilence
that walketh in darkness and from the destruc-
tion that wasteth at noonday. Guide us in
all our affairs and in all our efforts to uplift
degraded humanity; and may we go forth lead-
ing the van of the nations in the great work
of human progress and evangelization. God
grant that His blessing may be upon us and
make us faithful in the discharge of all our
high trusts and duties; and when we are called
from this to another world may we hear the
great Judge saying to each of us individually,
'• Well done, good and faithful servant: enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord." Through
Jesus Christ we ask it. Amen.
