HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Ten miles below Mouth of Red River, March 18, 1864.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf, New Orleans:

GENERAL: I am just now (3 p. m.) transferring the staff from the Nebraska to the laurel Hill. We shall again be on our way in a quarter of an hour, and expect to be in Alexandria by 9 a. m. to-morrow. I learn that the Red River has risen considerable, making navigation easy, and that some of the gun-boats have gone above Alexandria. It will be a great advantage if light-draught steamers can get up here soon. Holabird should use dispatch in getting the Red Chief and other boats from Brashear to the Mississippi. It iw reported that one of the gun-boats had a fight a short distance above Alexandria, and lost some men killed and wounded. No results given.

Very respectfully, general, your most obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-Genera, Chief of Staff.

In so serious a matter, I must ask, is the Third Brigade, Grover's division, ordered to go to Alexandria, and by whom? It is signed "R. B. Corwin [Irwin], assistant adjutant-general."

Brigadier General C. GROVER,

SIR: I understood the commanding general at first that you were to wait for the First Brigade, but his present orders are that there must be no delay in marching from Brashear, but move with the troops you have. The remaining brigade will follow as soon as possible by water. The commanding general will be here to-morrow afternoon.
