Major-General MEADE:

I inclose you copy of a dispatch sent to you this evening by signal.* The Fifth [Second?] Corps is here. i will send copy of the dispatch to Generals Griffin and Wright. Sheridan with the cavalry is at Prospect Station. The enemy cannot go to Lynchburg, possibly. I think there is no doubt but that Stoneman entered that city this morning. I will move my headquarters up with the troops in the morning, probably to Prospect Station. Have the prisoners been sent to City Point yet? If not they should go at once under strong escort.

U. S. GRANT,
