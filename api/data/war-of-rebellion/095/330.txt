We were aroused by the rapid and continued firing at 4.15 a.m. My men were immediately formed in the trenches, where they remained during the action. The left of my command, consisting of Companies B and C, commanded by Captain Merkel, kept up a continual flank fire on the enemy as they advanced and retreated from their works.

My loss consisted in 1 killed and 6 wounded.

Respectfully submitted.
