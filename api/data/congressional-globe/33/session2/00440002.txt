the Clerk of the House inform the Senate that a
quorum of the House have appeared and an-
swered to their names, and that the House is now
ready to proceed to business.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. JONES. I now move that a committee of
three be appointed by the Chair, to wait upon the
President of the United States, in conjunction
with such committee as may be appointed by the
Senate, to inform him that a quorum of the two
Houses have met, and are ready to receive any
communication which he may have to make.
The motion was agreed to; and the Speaker
thereupon appointed the following gentlemen said
committee on the part of the House: Messrs.
George W. Jones, Solomon G. H^yen, and
Thomas H. Bayly.
DRAWING FOR SEATS.
Mr. FLORENCE: I offer the following reso-
lution:
Resolved, That the Clerk of this House, immediately
after the passage of this resolution, place in a box^be name
of each member and delegate of the House of Representa-
tives, wiiiten on a sepaiale slip of paper; that he then
proceed, in the presence of the House, to draw from said
box, one at a time, the said slips of paper, and as each is
drawn, ho shall announce the name of the member or dele-
gate upon it, wh© shall choose his seat for the present
session; Provided, That befoie baid drawing shall com-
mence, the Speaker shall cause every seat to be vacated,
and shall see that every seat conunues vacant until it is
selected under t&is oider.
Ml*. } IILLYER. I propose to amend that reso-
lution so as to provide that the members be re-
quired, before tne drawing commences, to retire
from their seats.
The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that,
under the resolution as it stands, he has authority to
inquire members to vacate their seats. Such has
been the practice heretofore.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. I have re-
ceived a message from my colleague, Mr. Church-
well, who passed through this city a few days
ago, and went to the city of New York. I am
informed by that message that he is quite sick,
and has been unable to get here this morning, as
he intended. He therefore requests that one of
his colleagues may be permitted to select a seat for
him.
Mr. BOCOCK. Is he in the city?
Mr. STANTON. He was in the city, but
went to New York, with the expectation of re-
turning by this morning, which, of course, he
could have done, and would have dene, had he
not been taken sick. I conceive that it is the same
as if he had been taken sick in this city; but I
simply desire to submit his request to the House,
and I shall be satisfied with the decision of the
House whatever it may be.
The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that
i the gentleman from Tennessee submits his motion
as an amendment to the resolution of the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Florence.]
Mr. STANTON. Yes, sir.
Mr. DICKINSON. I hope the amendment of
the gentleman from Tennessee will prevail; and I
wish to make a similar motion in behalf of one
of my colleagues, Mr. Ebmands, who came on
with me to the Astor House, New York. On
Friday morning he sent for me to come tohis room,
where 1 found him confined to his bed by sick-
ness. He requested me to ack the House to allow
a seat to be drawn for him, as he has been de-
tained on the way to Washington by sickness. I
hops that request will be granted, and also the
request of the gentleman from Tennessee on be-
half of his colleague.
Mr, WHEELER. I hope that a colleague of
mine, Mr. Hughes, who is detained in Phila-
delphia by illness, wHi also be allowed to have a
scat selected for him.
M'. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I wish to say
that 1 have never yet known permission given to
draw by proxy for any person out of the city, al-
though indisposed. It has been usual to allow
friends to draw for those detained in the city by
sickness, but never for those absent from the
city. I hope that the usual rule will be adhered
to. if there be any member unwell in the city,
he will be allowed, under the usual rule, to have
a seat drawn for him by a friend.
The SPEAKER. The motion of the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. Wheeler] will not be
in order until the amendment to the amendment,
first proposed by the gentleman from Tennessee,
[Mr. Stanton,] is disposed of. After that, it will
then be acted upon in its order.
Mr. CULLOM. I insist upon a strict adher-
ence to what has been the usual practice of the
House. Ifit'be departed from, I give notice that
I shall ask permission to draw for my colleague,
[Mr. Bugg,] who is detained in the Old Dominion
upon a visit to his relatives.
Mr. CARUTHERS. If the usual rule be de-
parted from, I shall ask permission to draw for
my colleague, [Mr. Miller,] who is detained by
sickness in St. Louis.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ten-
nessee [Mr. Stanton] moves that some gentle-
man be authorized or named by the Chair to draw
a seat for his colleague, [Mr Csurchwell.] The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Dickinson]
proposes to amend the motion, so as to embrace
the name of his colleague, [Mr. Edmands.]
The question was then taken on the amendment
to the amendment, and it was rejected.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. I withdraw
the motion I made.
The question was then taken upon the resolu-
tion as originally introduced; and it was agreed to.
The SPEAKER. The Chair, in esecutisn of
the order made by the adoption of the resolution,
directs that each member shall retire outside of
the bar of the House. The officers of the House
will see that all remain outside of the bar until
their names shall have been called; then they shall
be admitted inside to choose their seals.
MESSAGES FROM THE SENATE-
A message was here received from the Senate, by
the hands of Asbury Dickins, Esq., their Secre-
tary, informing the House that they had assem-
bled, that the Hon. Lewis Cass, of Michigan,
had been chosen President of the Senate pro tem-
pore for this day, and that they were ready to
proceed to business.
A message was also received from the Senate,
by the hands of Mr. Maciien, their Chief Clerk,
informing the House that they had appointed a
committee, to join such committee as may be ap-
pointed by the House, to wait upon the President
to inform him that a quorum of the Senate had
assembled and were ready to receive any commu-
nication he might be pleased to make, and that
Messrs. Dodge, of Iowa, Dawson, of Georgia,
and Toucey, of Connecticut, constituted such
committee on the part of the Senate.
DRAWING FOR SEATS AGAIN.
The House'then proceeded io the execution of
the order for choosing seats. The members re-
tired without the bar, and when their n&taes were
severally drawn selected their seats. The process
was thus completed.
VETO MESSAGE HARBOR BILL.
_ The SPEAKER. Near the close of last ses-
sion a veto message from the President of the
United States was received by the House. There^
being no quorum present the message was not
read. The Chair supposes, undet the Constitution,
the first business in order is the consideration of
the President's veto message. If it is the pleasure
of the House the message will be read.
Mr. CL1NGMAN. It is competent, I take it,
to postpone the subject until to-morrow or some
other future day, and I hope there will be no ob-
jection to such postponement. I make the motion
that its further consideration be postponed until
to-morrow.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection, the
consideration will be postponed until that time, by
unanimous consent.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Will it be in order to move
that its consideration 4>e postponed until the first
Monday in December next?
The SPEAKER. The more regular mode of
proceeding would be to read the message first. It
will then be for the House to dispose of the mat-
ter as they may think proper.
Mr. WENT WORTH, of Illinois. I wish to
make an inquiry. Will not the reading of the
message require action on the bill to follow it?
The bill has been returned to the House, and the
Constitution requires that, the message being read,
the House shall proceed to act upon the veto bill.
1 think the better way would be to pass the whole
matter by informally until to-morrow or some
other day, and then take the subject up and dis-
pose of it.
