ordered
Mr STANLY was understood to say he did not like to see
the time of the House consumed in a manner which *ecmed to
him to he absurd and ridiculous It the bankrupt law was to

But he had risen to ask foi information Jf the yeas and
nays were now taken, would it nottben be past two o'clock, (the
hour designated in the insti iictions,) and, if so, could the com
mtttee report unless the motion was amended?
Mr WISE The gentleman from Kentucky [Mi Royd] can
modify his motion
Mr GRANGER We have been brought to the severest
rules that thisHouse can ofor to push thisbu mess, and I now
avail myself of them to put it off
Mr BOYD here rising, a nd he would modify his instructions
by substituting ' three" o'clock for "two "
Mr WISE    Say' forthwith '
Mr BOYD again modified his instructions by striking out
the hour, and inserting in lieu ttieieof,' instanter "

bo the instructions, as modified, were agreed to
Mr T P MARSHAL!, rose, and was understood to call
upon the Commitfpp on the Tttdiciary to mike theirreport m
obedience to the order of the House
Mr J C CLARK rose and ">ofeJ that the House proceed to
the orders of the day
Mr GRANGER addressing the Speakei, inquired whether
this report conld ride over the special order made under a
suspension of the rules, towjt, the reception of petitions, and
whether the report could be received now—[termination of the
sentence not heard ]
[The confusion m the hall was indescribable ]
Mr J C CLARK reiterated the demand that the Speaker
proceed withthe call for petitions
Mr WISE called upon the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee [Mr Barnard] to make a report m obedience to the or-
der of the House "Iaskhim," saidMi W "as one of the ma
jonty who gaye him the order, to bring in a bill instanter, now
to report, and I insist that the Latin word "instanter," Angli.
cised, means mblunfty—instanter
[Cries of "exactly exactly, to be sure "]
Mi J C CLARK said it seemed to him that the motion made
by the gentleman was a reflection upon the committee itself
"Instanter" of course meant fí i reasonable time "
[Roars of laugh'er, with cries of "go it old boy—that's not
Latin," i&c ]
Mr C proceeded Independent of that, how could the com-
mittee, here m this body deliberating with us, and compelled to
be here by the rule duung the sessi n of the House, retire to
their room for the purpose ofprepanng a odV?
The SPEAKER Tins debate is very irregular, there is no
direct question before the House
Mr I C CLARK The Speaker is mistaken I made amo-
tion that the House proceed lo the regular order of business,
which is tlie reception of petitions
The SPEAKER But the chairman oi the Committee on the
Judiciaiy has been mstiucled to make a report by an order of
the House pistpassed,
Mr FILLMORE I object to the report being made out of
order.
Mr BARNARD said tnat no man who knew him would sup.
pose that he was d sposed to have any controversy with the
House or the Chan He was di-posed to obey any ordei which
might be given to him asan humble member of one of the com
mlttees under the direction of the Speaker and the House As
he construed the resolution, it was directed to the committee,
not to any member of the committee It was therefore for the
committee toobey,andhewas but one of the members of the
committee
Mr BURNELL lose to a point of order He submitted that
there was no question befoic the Hviuse
Mr HOPKINS presumed that there was a question before
the House arising out of the itsolution which had just been
passed and he submitted whether under that íesolution or er
oer it was not the duty of the Speaker 'o call for the report
Mr BT1RNELL If the gentleman from New Yoik [Mr
Barnard]offeis a rernrt I piesume it will be competent for
the House to deride whether it will receive it or not
The SPEAKER    You aie right
Mr Wl^E irsisted that there was a ques ion before the
House The House had pist j assed an order that a report from
the Committee on the Judiciaiy should be made instantly,
which ordei ought to be obeyed He put it to the gentleman
from New Yoik whethei he bad not been ordered to report,
and whether a bill was nof now h°re ready to be reported in
obedience to that ordei?
Mr C J IN GERr-OLL, as a member of the Committee on
the Juihfiia'-y desired to state a fact------
[Great confus'on and uproar, and loud cries to fIOrder "]
Mr ftAUNDERS, as a member of the same committee,
claimed theriebt to report i bill
Mr L WILLIAMS (addressing the Speaker ) Is not the
business now beloie the House the call of the States forpeti
tions1 Th it business has been brought before the House by a
vote of two thirds, and I msiot that it is not in the power of a
maiorily to suspend an order of business bi ought up by a vote
of two thn '=.
Ml   SAUNDERS again declared himself rcdy to report
Mr STANLY I hrpe my colleague will not introduce this
bill I beglnm tosive North Carolina from that reproach
Let the gent einan from Pennsylvania [Mr C J Inoeksoi,i,]
who is striving forthe floor—lelhim introduce it
Mr FILLMORE was understood, though scarcely heard, to
refer to the fact o! the older of business—io wit, the íectption
of petitions—having been over and ovei again postponed by a
vote o'two thuds, tne Speaker himseK deciding that sucha
vote wasrequsue Mr P read that portion of the 127th rule
which say
"Nor shall the o del of business as established by the rules of
the House, he postponed or changed, except by a vote of at
least two thirds of the membeis piesent '
And Mr F sa d no such vote had been given in the pr°sent
case
Mr WISE argued that this was entuely a different order
from that taken the othei day, Ac The question now was,
should the minority govern the majn-ity by means of a resort to
every trivial motion to put of busires0
[Cries to orler an 1 gre t confusion ]
Mr CUSHING I call upon tiK Chair to state what the ques
tion is and to dec de whether it is deba ab e or not
The SPEAKER 'Ihe Chair unde,stands the question to be
this The Hoitse bv a vo e tips oidered the Commut e on the
Tudiciary to ipport a bil now One of the merbersof the
IIousp whether of the maionty or minority is not material, de
mands the execu ion of ttn* or'er Upon that demand, the
gentleman fioni Ni-w Yori, [Mi Fillmore] Iaues the point of
ordprthatthi rerortis rot now the rcgulai order of business,
and herefnrp objects to its reception
Mr CUSHING is theie a motion before the House upon
which I can vote?
The SPEAKER \es The gentleman from Vireima, as the
Chair undeistands, moves that the Commit'ee on the Judiciary
be required to report
Mi GUSHING There can be no debate or proceeding until
there is pen line a motion upon which we can vote
The SPEAKER The Chair understands the gentleman
from Virginia as moving that this order ot the House be e-ce
cuted
Mr WISE m i ted that no mo ion was required, and tl 
question was whether a point of ordei should overiule the
direct and po-itive order of the House that this repot t should be
made
Mr WINTHROP What authority has the Chair for not
calling upon the nextSt-te for petitions, if the members from
Kentucky have presented all they havel That is the regular
ordtr of business and I calljbr it
The SPEiKf R It has been arrested by the subsequent pro-
ceedmgs of the House
[Very great confusion prevailed in every part of the Hal! ]
|     The SPEAKER said that this was a new case    The Chaij
