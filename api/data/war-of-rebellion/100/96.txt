GENERAL: We are getting along finely here. I hope to have both bridges completed this p. m. and hope to run trains through to-morrow. Our facilities are good for forwarding supplies with dispatch. Troops are arriving. They march to the front. The steamers have gone to Hilton Head. I suppose you had a pleasant trip on the Bat. I had a rough voyage on the Russia.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
