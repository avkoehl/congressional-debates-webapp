I will be able to decide about the wagon bridge across Lick Creek. What information did the flag-of-truce party gain about the condition of the road above Greenville?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 12, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

The evidence is conclusive that the railroad is uninjured, except near Lick Creek. The rebels ran their cars down from Bristol yesterday, but the bridges at Watauga and Holston are reported to be such light affairs that it is doubtful if they stand the ordinary spring freshest. The wagon roads are reported in horrible condition.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

The rebels have not injured the railroad above Greenville. The Watauga and Holston bridges are still standing. I have not yet learned definitely what force remains in the vicinity of Bristol. The wagon roads are nearly impassable. It rains almost continually. I have sent one division of the Fourt's Corps to General Thomas, and will send the other in a few days.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., April 12, 1864.

Colonel GALLUP:

You will at once send sufficient force in direction of Preston to watch the movements of the enemy, and report all developments to these headquarters. If you have any news report at once.

By command of Brigadier-General Hobson:

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HUNTSVILLE, ALA., April 12, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville:

Dodge's mounted force came up day before yesterday on the south side of the Tennessee to opposite Whitesburg and met only small scouting parties of rebels. Clanton's brigade of rebel cavalry has gone to Moulton and Danville.
