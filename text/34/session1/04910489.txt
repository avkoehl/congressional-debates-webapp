pension; which was referred to the Committee on
Pensions.

the heirs of Captain John Mussey, praying for
the redemption of certain bills of credit issued by
the authority of the Continental Congress during
the revolutionary war; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. BRODHEAD. I beg leave to present the
memorial of Thomas A. Hendricks and others,
heads of the Bureaus in the executive depart-
ments at Washing-ton, who represent that the
compensation assigned to the respective offices
held by them was fixed, in most instances, more
than half a century ago, and that it is nowutterly
inadequate, m view of the greatly increased ex-
penses of living at the metropolis of the nation;
that the duties of their offices have augmented
with the growth and business of the country,
until they have become of the most important
character. The Secretary of the Treasury has
twice, I believe, recommended this increase. I
move the reference of the memorial and papers to
the Committee on Finance.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ^BRODHEAD presented the petition of
John Grayson, pension agent at Pittsburg, pray-
ing to be allowed a credit in the settlement of his

inson and others, residents of the Indian country

States and those Indians; which was referred to
the Committee on Indian Affairs.

Committee 011 Commerce.
Mr. FOSTER presented the petition of Mary

father in the revolutionary war; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Revolutionary Claims.
Mr. TRUMBULL presented the petition of
Jacob Schenck, an officer in the revolutionary
army, praying for compensation for his services
and remuneration for losses sustained by him
during that war; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Revolutionary Claims.
Mr. JONES, of Iowa, presented a petition of
settlers upon and near the military reservation at
Fort Atkinson, Iowa, praying that the purchasers
of the fort buildings on that reservation may not
be allowed the right of preemption to any lands
except those on which those buildings are situ-
ated; which was referred to the Committee on
Public Lands.
Also, two petitions of citizens of Iowa, pray-
ing for the establishment of a mail route from
West Union, Iowa, to Austin, in the Territory

mittee on the Post Office and Post Roads.
THE NAVAL RETIRING BOARD.
Mr. HUNTER presented the memorial of Rob-
ert D. Thorburn, a commander in the Navy, who
has been placed upon the reserved list, praying
to be restored to his former position in the ser-
vice; which was referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore presented the
petition of James A. Doyle, a lieutenant in the
Navy, who has been placed upon the reserved
list, complaining that injustice has been done him,
and praying for such redress as Congress may
deem suitable and just; which was referred to the
Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. BAYARD. I presentthe petition of Hen-
ry A. Steele, a lieutenant in the United States
Navy, asking for redress from the action of the
late naval board, in reference to his case. He
admits that his health disqualifies him from active
duty, but he complains of having been placed on
the furlough list. He states that he has been in
the Navy for twenty-nine years, and during that
time has never been court-martialed or reprimand-
ed. He lost his health while serving on the coast
of Africa between the years 1844 and 1846. If
that statement of his be true, I think there can
be but one opinionâ€”that an officer who, in the
service of his country, loses his health, not by
any vice, folly, or error of his own, certainly,
according to the intent of that law, should not
have been placed upon the furlough list. I move
that the memorial be referred to the Committee
on Naval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. FISH. I am requested to present the
petition of shipowners and merchants of the city
of New York on behalf of Commander Thomas
R. Gedney, who, under the action of the late
naval board, has been placed on the reserved list
with furlough pay. The petitioners represent
that his health has been greatly impaired by ex-
posure and hardships in the Coast Survey, and
they refer to Ins valuable services in discovering
a new channel entering into the port of New
York. They request that he may be restored to
his former emoluments and pay. I move that
the petition be referred to the Committee on Na-
val Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.

THE BRITISH ENLISTMENT QUESTION.
Mr. MASON. I ask leave to offer a resolution,
which will be found, I think, of general public
interest; and when it is read I wish to make a few
remarks upon it.
The Secretary read the resolution as follows:
Resolved, That the President be requested, if not incom-
patible with the public interest, to communicate to the
Senate the correspondence which has taken place between
tin-: Government and that of Great Butam m regard to the
enlistment of sokkeis within the United States, by the
agents and officers of the latter, for the British army, ac-
companied by i-iu.h evidence and documents? as the Presi-
dent may deem proper to show the connection of these
agents and olficer- with the alleged violation of our laws
and sovereign lights.
Mr. MASON. Mr. President, I ask the-Senate
to consider the resolution now, because, in look-
ing into that subject, I have been strongly im-
pressed with the belief that it is desirable now to
spread that information before the country.
The Senate is aware, of course, that the Pres-
ident of the United States, in his annual message,
communicated to both Houses of Congress all
the documents and correspondence which had
taken place between the Government of Eng-
