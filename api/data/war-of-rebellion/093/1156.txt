The road from Tullahoma to this place by way of Wartrace is better and eight miles shorter than by way of Shelbyville. I ask leave to order General Milroy to come by Wartrace.

Two trains have been ordered to Tullahoma to load surplus commissary stores now there. As soon as they arrive I wish you to have them loaded in the shortest possible time, when they will proceed direct to Chattanooga with the stores.

TULLAHOMA, November 29, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

I have ten guns here, and not a horse or mule to move them with - four of them are heavy siege guns; also a large amount of ammunition and regimental camp and garrison equipage; also 150 sick, and hospital supplies. There are over 200 contrabands unable to march.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-11.30 p.m.

Major-General MILROY, Tullahoma:

Load your artillery and sick upon train now at Tullahoma immediately and send off as soon as you can. You can also load your sick upon empty cars of any north-bound train until you get all off. A train of box-cars will reach you to-morrow from Cowan, as soon as General Steedman's troops disembark, in which you can put any sick you have remaining and other property not already gotten away. Answer.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
