WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., January 25, 1865-10.20 a. m.

JOHN W. GARRETT, Esq.,

Baltimore:

It is a great reproach and injury to the service that, no matter what urgency there may be, no railroad communication between Washington and Annapolis can be relied on for want of your having engines fit to run on that road. Can you not correct this evil, or must the Department provide a remedy for an evil so enormous and unnecessary?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
