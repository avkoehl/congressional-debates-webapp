Lieutenant-General GRANT:

(For Secretary of War, Washington.)

Colonel John I. Curtin, Forty-fifth Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, has heretofore been recommended, both for a brevet and promotion. No more deserving appointment could be made. He is an invaluable brigade commander. Unless promoted or brevetted he will lose the command of his brigade by the return of a senior colonel, who has been absent from duty for twelve out of the last fifteen months, and is not as well fitted for the position.

JNumbers G. PARKE,Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded to the Secretary of War, with recommendation that Colonel Curtin be promoted by brevet.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
