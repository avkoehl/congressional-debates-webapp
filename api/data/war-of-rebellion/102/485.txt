SPRINGFIELD, May 17, 1865-8 p. m.

Major BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A band of forty-six rebels has crossed the road east of Lebanon about an hour since and are moving rapidly across the Osage and will probably attempt to cross at or near Mining Ford. They have captured a lieutenant and six men of the Sixteenth [Missouri] Cavalry and the sheriff and enrolling officer of Laclede County. I have a good force after them and nearly up to them and think we shall destroy them before reaching the Osage, but troops on the other side should be ready for them.
