discharge of their professional duties, and have assisted greatly in most cases in the education of the men. Books have been supplied to them whenever requisition has been made, and orders have been issued that they shall be instructed in the Articles of War, and an edition of the Articles of War printed especially for the use of the men of this corps. It will be apparent that whatever soldierly qualifications may be ultimately found in these men, their full development may be ultimately found in these men, their full development requires time. The troops of other nations are such as have been made by military operations running through many centuries.

It is unreasonable to expect that men who have never handled a musket, who have never been admitted to civil or individual rights, can instantaneously become perfect soldiers. The organization in this department has proceeded upon the idea that it was a work of difficulty, requiring much time. Had instances of insubordination, of which this is the only one, been more frequent-had they signally failed in comprehending the routine duties of the soldier, or had they shrunk before the enemy in battle-it would have been no proof of their incapacity for war.

I have the honor to be, with must respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army.
