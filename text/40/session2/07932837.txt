THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

of it in that way is by moral suasion. Then,
as the distillation of spirits is in some measure
sustained by public opinion, and notwithstand-
ing a very large quantity is distilled over and
^above what is needed for manufacturing pur-
poses, in what way can the largest amount of
revenue be derived from it?
Uponacareful consideration, Mr. Chairman,
I am satisfied that a reduction of the tax would
tend to check demoralization and produce a
much larger revenue, and the question is, how
much ought it to be reduced ? Some contend
that it ought not to be more than fifty cents per
gallon ; that if it was more than that it would
not be sufficient to prevent the enormous frauds
perpetrated by the distillation of spirits from
cheap molasses imported, for every device has
been resorted to to defraud the Government by
illicit distillation. For my parti will not agree
to put the tax below fifty cents per gallon, and
even at that, if there should be one hundred
million gallons distilled and returned for tax-
ation it would amount to $50,000,000, and if
seventy million gallons to $35,000,000, or if
but sixty million gallons it would amount to
$30,000,000, -which is more than ever derived
by the Government in any one year from the
distillation of whisky. I am satisfied that at
least $30,000,000 could be derived per annum
at a tax of fifty cents per gallon. At any rate,
I am opposed to the tax being more than one
dollar per gallon, as I feel confident that more
revenue could be collected and less inducement
to commit fraud. And whatever amount of
1 taxation we agree upon, let its collection be
rigorously enforced by competent and honest
officers ; and if the President will not agree to
remove incompetent aud dishonest men he
ought to be proceeded against, notwithstanding
there are but a few months of his term remain-
ing. It is his sworn duty to see that the
laws are faithfully executed, and the country
demands it.
I do not believe, Mr. Chairman, as contended
by some, that men cannot be found that will
faithfully enforce the collection of the revenue.
We have plenty of honest men, if appointed
and paid a fair salary, who will honestly and
faithfully do their duty, and that neither the
whisky '' ring" or any other can operate upon.
1 trust, therefore, that a reduction of the tax
will be made, as I believe it for the interest of
the country. I am opposed to raising the tax
on the manufacture of common cigars, as it k
increasing the tax upon the poor man; and if
it is a luxury to smoke, let him enjoy it as well
as the rich, though he cannot afford to smoke
as line a quality of cigars.
As my time has expired, I cannot extend my
remarks, but will say, in conclusion, that lam
pleased with the general features of thebill, and
trust Congress will, before final adjournment,
enact it into a law. The national debt, though
some twenty-five huudred million dollars, is
not burdensome, taking into consideration the
resources of this great country; and I am not
in favor of this generation, who have paid such
enormous sums in suppressing the late rebel-
lion and its consequences, paying off the en-
tire national debt, but leave a portion of it to
be defrayed by the next, to whom this great
Republic will descend.
Mr. MAYNAIID addressed the House. [See
Appendix.]
Mr. ALLISON. Mr. Chairman, I know how
- anxious every member of this House is to
reach the practical business ot this tax bill,
and how reluctant all are to listen to the gen-
eral debate. But I beg to mention to gentle-
men that if they will, as wo progress with the
reading and consideration of this bill, give it
careful attention, they will find that, notwith-
standing the voluminous bill which appears
before them, we can proceed with great rapidity
in its consideration; for there are really but
three controverted propositions in the bill, as
I believe. Ono is the first proposition having
reference to the subject which has just been
so ably discussed by my colleague upon the
committeo, [Mr. Maynaud,] that ol a sepa-
rate department. Another is the question
involved in the collection of the tax upon dis-
tilled spirits; and the other the proposition
having reference to the tax upon tobacco.
I desire, in the time allotted to me, to make
some general remarks upon the question of tax-
ation, alluding also to some specific provisions
of the bill; aad I shall endeavor to show that
there is in this bill enough to provide ample
revenue for the maintenance of the Govern-
ment and the payment of interest on the pub-
lic debt, together with a reasonable surplus to
be applied to the payment of the principal of
the debt.
I listened, last night, Mr. Chairman, with
intense interest and admiration to the remarks
of the gentleman from New York, [Mr. Wood.]
I was glad to hear from him, a leader of the
Democratic party, that that party proposes in
no form whatever to repudiate the national
obligations, but that every dollar of those obli-
gations must be paid in the letter and spirit in
which those obligations were created; and
although I cannot agree with him as to the
method of its payment, yet I think there was
enough in all the gentleman said last night to
give hope to the country. I agree with him
there is yet undeveloped, in the far West,
extending from the frozen regions of the North
down to the tropics, lands filled with mineral
resources almost invaluable—
"Far away,
On waters whose blue surface ne'er gave back
Xhe white man's face, among Missouri's springs
And pools, whose issues swell the Oregon,"
are to be found sources of wealth which, either
by individual enterprise or by the Government,
will be in the future developed, and I think
will aid us in lightening the burdens of taxa-
tion which now press so heavily upon us, which
development is to be rapidly hastened by the
building of railroads binding the Atlantic to
the Pacific with iron bands.
Mr. Chairman, the policy of Congress during
the past few years has been to reduce the bur-
dens of taxation as well as to reduce the ex-
penses of the Government. From necessity,
during the years of the war,we were compelled
from year to year to increase our taxes; and
laws were passed constantly increasing taxes,
commencing, 1 believe, with the year 1802,
then in the year 1803, and finally the act ot
June 30,1864,which enormously increased the
burdens of the people in the shape of internal
taxes, as well as in the shape of tariff laws.
During that year there was an entire revision
of the internal revenue and tariff laws. The
act of March 8, 1805, still further increased
taxation. This increase was absolutely neces-
sary in order to sustain the public credit and
to carry on the war against the formidable
rebellion against the Government. At the close
of the hostilities iu 18G5 it was the first busi-
ness of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, when it
assembled in 1805, to proceed to the consider-
ation of the questions invoked ill the reduc-
tion of the taxes. At the first session of the
Thirty-Ninth Congress a law was passed re-
ducing the burdens of taxation to the extent
of $60,000,000; and at the second session of
the same Congress a law was passed which had
the effect still further to reduce those burdens
to the extent of §40,000,000 more. Tins Con-
gress, at its present session, following up this
principle and this policy, has reduced the bur-
dens of taxation uuon the people to the extent
of $80,000,000 more. Twenty-three million
dollars of reduction of taxation has been made
to the people of the rebellious bta,les in the
shape of the abolition of the tax on raw cotton. 1
The remainder of this $80,000,000 of reduc-
tion has taken place upon the industry of the
country, which, next to agriculture, is the lite-
blood of the nation ; as unless we foster every
branch of ouiyndustry we cannot expect to
flourish as a people.
