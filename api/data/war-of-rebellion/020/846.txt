CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. 1ST MILL. DIST, DEPT, S. C., GA., AND FLA.,

Charleston, March 27, 1863.

The approach of the enemy northward from Port Royal may indicate a speedy attack on the city of Charleston. The brigadier-general commanding this district desires that commanders of sub-divisions will keep their troops in their commands in fighting condition. All batteries should be supplied with whatever is necessary for immediate action, and the utmost vigilance exercised by all guards and pickets as well as commanding officers. Prompt reports of any unusual occurrences must be reported at once to these headquarters.

This circular will be extended to proper commanders.

By command of Brigadier-General Ripley:

WM. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA,Adams Run, March 28, 1863-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General JORDAN,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Last yet the enemy landed on Seabrook Island and marched across John's Island to Legareville, not attempting any movements on the main. Should they attempt the same march again, and not have present in North Edisto a force sufficiently large to threaten the main seriously at the same time, a blow might be struck at them on the march between the Cocked Hat and Aberpoolie Bridge. I have recently examined the country carefully, and send by my aide, Captain Tracy, an accurate map, which, with his explanations, will put you fully in possession of my views. I do not think this feasible without the addition of three or four regiments to my force.

I communicate this because, if it meets the views of the commanding general, the re-enforcements should be sent to-morrow to Rantowles Station.

Very respectfully,

JOHNSON HAGOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
