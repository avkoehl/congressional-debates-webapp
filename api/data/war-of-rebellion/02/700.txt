WAR DEPARTMENT, June 18, 1861.

Colonel WILLIAM B. FRANKLIN, New York:

Hasten on the troops. Send all you can. I have telegraphed to Quartermaster Thompkins to send as many as he can by the New Jersey Central Railroad. Let him use freight cars if they have not enough passenger cars. Send the others by way of Philadelphia. See him about it.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

JUNE 18, 1861-1.35 a. m.

Brigadier-General SCHENCK:

It is not intended you shall attempt to carry the position at Vienna.

Colonel Corcoran, with four companies, and Brigadier-General Tyler, with part of his brigade, will soon be with you.

Get your wounded attended to, and as soon as General Tyler arrives let them go down by the first train he may send.

Let me know when Colonel Corcoran and General Tyler arrive.

Let me have report early to-morrow morning.
