E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 20, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

I think your staff is decidedly leaky. The substance of my telegrams to you is immediately telegraphed back here to the press. Several of these telegrams have been intercepted. Clean out all such characters from your headquarters. It is useless to attempt any sending of orders if you permit them to be made public as soon as you receive them.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 20, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Rappahannock, Va.:

Porter's corps is beginning to arrive at Aquia Creek. It will be under the command of General Burnside for the present. It will be pushed up the Rappahannock as rapidly as possible. Telegraph to me anything you wish Burnside's forces to do in order to co-operate with you.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
