enemy some of deas' and Brantly's skirmishers allowed themselves to be bayoneted in the pits rather than be driven back. The skirmishers of Gibson's brigade on the 5th, and of Barker's on the 7th, permitted half of their number to be killed, wounded, and captured before the others would leave their position. These few instances of heroism out of many are mentioned with the hope that they may be imitated rather than permit the enemy to approach our main line.

Hereafter, instead of arousing the men in the trenches at 3 a. m., it will not be done until 3.45, when only half of them will be awakened. The other half will be allowed to sleep unless movements of the enemy make it necessary to awaken them. The attention of commanding officers is called to the number of men killed and wounded in the trenches.

Every effort will be taken to prevent the loss of life by building traverses and using every means that may suggest themselves.
