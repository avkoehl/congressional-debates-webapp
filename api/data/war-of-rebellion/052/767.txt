just reported to me, informing me that his brigade is moving up here. I will put him in position as soon as he arrives. General Spears ranks me a day or two. We will be wide awake. You can draw your own inference from the reports of Crook and McCook.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Near McCulloch's Cross-Roads, September 21, 1863-6.30 p.m.

Major WILLIAM H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the officer commanding the pickets reports the enemy in front, at the junction of the Crawfish Spring and Chattanooga roads, to consist of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry, supposed to consist of one brigade, is drawn up in line of battle. The infantry is estimated as one division, and probably a detachment. Our pickets are thrown out well to the front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE CROOK

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S. - Our pickets extend to the base of the mountain.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Dry Valley, near Chattanooga, September 21, 1863.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have the honor to report that I have during the day observed large clouds of dust, evidently proceeding from large columns

passing to the left of our infantry position. I am induced to think from my observations that a general attack is contemplated by the enemy to-morrow along our entire line. Cavalry in the valley have been skirmishing very slightly here, apparently feeling our position. To-night, as I have previously reported, I ascertained from Major Presdee, Second Indiana Cavalry, that Wheeler is advancing upon him from the gap.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

GENERAL: All quiet here during the night.
