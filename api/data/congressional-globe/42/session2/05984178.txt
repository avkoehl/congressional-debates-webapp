land district in arizona.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Arizona. I move that
the rules be suspended, and the Committee on
the Public Lands be discharged from the fur-
ther consideration of the bill (IT. R. No 2089)
creating an additional land district in the Terri-
tory of Arizona, and that the same be passed.
Mr. RANDALL. Is this the report of a
committee?
, Mr. McCORMICK, of Arizona. I would
say that this bill has been considered by the I
Committee on the Public Lands and has
received their approval.
Mr. MAYNARD. I would inquire if this
bill has been before any committee'/
The SPEAKER. The Chair knows nothing
about the bill.
Mr. DUNNELL. The billhas been before
the Committee 011 the Public Lands and they
unanimously recommend its passage.
Mr. MAYNARD. What do the sales of
public lands in Arizona amount to ?
Mr. McCORMICK, of Aiizuna. I do not
know the exact amount.
Mr. MAYNARD. Is the amount sufficient
to pay the salaries of these officers ?
Mr. McCORMICK, of Arizona. Yes, sir.
The present land otlicc is two hundred and
fifty to three hundred and filty miles from many
of the surveyed lands, and that is one reason
why comparatively few land sales have beeu
made. The Commissioner of the General
Land Office recommends the passage of this
bill. 1 aik for the reading of the letter from
him which 1 send to-the Clerk's desk.
The Clerk read as lollows:
Department op the Intkriotc,
uliixmul L,ym> Office,
Washington, li. t!., April M, w72.
Str: Referring to your letter of the 2.2(1 instant,
relative 10 tbe establishment of an additional land
district in Arizona, I would state that I have care-
fully considered the subject, and in view of the laeb
ttiat tlie residents ot southern Arizona are subject
to great danger and hardship in proceeding 10 she
land office at Preseoit. and that as it is desira hie to
offer all reasonable facilities to the settlers who are
now in that region, as well as those who ui.iy be
induced to go there to settle along the line ol the
Texas Pacific ranroad, there appears to be a neces-
sity lor tile creation of anew land district, although
the amount of business now transacted at the local
land ofhee in the Territory would not under other
circumstances justify me in making the recommend-
ation.
Very respectfully,
WILLIS DRUMMOND,
