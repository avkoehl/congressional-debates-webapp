THE C0KGB1SB10NAL GLOBE.
Question. Will you uot let me call your
attention, Mr. Witness? You say that you
directed a revised publication on Monday, and
it was so published. Now, did you ever com-
plain after that revised publication was made
to anybody that that publication was not a
true one within the next three months follow-
ing I
Answer. It is possible I might have com-
plained on Monday morning, if the corrections
were not made, but I do not recollect.
Question. Excuse me; I did not ask for a
possibility ?
Answer. I tell you I do not recollect.
Question. Bat it is possible you did not?
Answer. That I say again I cannot recollect.
Question. Now, sir, will you say that in any
important particular the speech as published
in jour paper differs from the speech us put in
evidence here?
Answer. I could not point out a solitary
case, because I have not read the speech as
put in evidence here, nor have I read the
speech since the morning after it was deliv-
ered ; so I know nothing about what you have
put in evidence here.
ETexry F. Zideb sworn and examined.
By Mr. C cut is :
Question. Where did you reside in the sum-
mer of 18(KS when the President visited St.
Louis?
Ansicer. At St. Louis, Missouri.
Question. What was then jour business?
Answer. I was then engaged as short-hand
writer and reporter for the Missouri Repub-
lican, a paper published at St. Louis.
Question. Had you anything to do with mak-
ing a report of the specch of the President
delivered from the balcony of the Southern
Hotel?
Answer. I made a short-hand report of the
speech. 1 was authorized to employ all the
assistance that 1 needed, for it was known that
the President was to be received at St. Louis.
I employed Mr. Walbridge and Mr. Allen to
assist me. Mr. Walbridge wrote out the report
for publication in the Sunday morning Repub-
lican. I went oi'er the same report on Sunday
alternoon and made several alterations in it
for the Monday morning paper.
Question. The Monday morning Republican?
Answer. Yes, sir. I made the corrections
from my own notes.
Question. Did you make any corrections ex-
cept those which you found were required by
jour own notes?
Answer. There were three or four corrections
that the printers did not make that I had
marked on the proof sheets that 1 made on
the paper tile following morning in the count-
ing room.
Question. With those exceptions, did you
make any corrections cxcept what were called
for by your own notes?
Answer. Those were called for by my own
notes.
Question. Rut they were not in fact made?
Answer. 'They were not in (act made in the
printed copy on Monday.
Que it ion. Now, answer my question whether
the corrections were called for by your own
notes ?
Answer. Oh, yes; all of them.
Question. Have you compared the report
which you made, and which was published in
the Republican on Monday, with the report
published in the St. Louis Democrat?
Answer. I have more particularly compared
the report published m the Monday Democrat
with the Sunday Republican.
Question. You compared those two?
Answer. Yes, sir. 'I here are about sixty
changes.
Mr. JOHNSON. Differences?
The Witness. Yes, sir.
By Mr. Corns:
Question. Describe the character of those
differences ?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. "State the differ-
ences. v I object to that.
Mr. CURTIS. Do you want him to repeat
the sixty differences?
Mr. Manager BUTLEll, Certainly; if he
can.
By Mr. Crims:
Question. Have you a memorandum of those
differences ?
Answer. I have.
Question. Read it, if you please?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Before he reads
it I should like to know when it was made.
By Mr. Curtis :
Question. When did you make this com-
parison ?
The Witness. The exact date?
Mr. CURTIS. If \ou can give it io us.
(after consulting a memorandum-
book.) Saturday, April 11.
Question. When did you make the memo-
randum ?
Answer. On the Sunday following.
By Mr. Manager Butler :
Question. Last Sunday?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. This month?
Answer. .Yes. sir.
By Mr. Cuutjs:
Question. From what did you make the
memorandum ?
Answer. I had been here before the board
of managers twenty four days, and was dis-
charged and had just returned to St. Louis. I
got telegraphic dispatches stating that I was
summoned again to appear before the Senate.
I then went to the Republican olliee, took the
bound files of the Republican and the bound
lilesof the Democrat for the latter part of lbGii.
and in company with Mr. James Monaghan,
one of the assistant edittus, 1 made a com-
parison of the Uvo papers, noted the differences,
compaied those differences twice afterward to
sec that they were accurate. That was on Sat-
urday. 1 started for Washington on Sunday
afternoon at throe o'clock, the first through
train.
Question. When was this paper that you call
the memorandum, which contains these differ-
ences, made ?
Answer. On Saturday.
Question. Was it made at the same time
when you made this comparison or at a differ-
ent time ?
Answer. The same day.
Mr. CURTIS. JSTow, you can tell us the
nature of the differences; or, if the honorable
Manager desires that all those differences
should be read, you can read them.
Mr. Manager BUTLEll. Stay a moment.
Any on which you rely we should like to have
read.
Mi. CURTIS. We rely on all of them, more
or less.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. Then all of them,
more or less, we want read.
Mr. CURTIS. We should prefer to save
time by giving specimens; but then, if jou
prefer to have them all read, we will have them
read.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. There is a ques-
tion back of this, 1 think, and that is, that we
have not the standard of comparison. Surely,
then, this cannot be evidence. This witness
goes to the Republican office and there takes
a paper—he cannot tell whether it was the true
one or not, whether made properly or not, or
what edition it was—and he compares it with
a copy of the Democrat, aud having made that
comparison lie now proposes to put in the re-
sults of it. I do not see how that can be evi-
dence. lie may state anything that he has a
recollection of; but to make the memorandum
evidence, to read the memorandum, never was
such a thing heaid of, I think.
Let. me restate it and I have done, lie goes
to the Republican ofliee, gets u Republican;
what Republican, how genuine, what eu;tion
it was, is not identified; he says it was in a
bound volume. He takes the Democrat, of
what edition we do not know, and compares
that, and then comes 1 .'re and attempts to put
in the results of a con -sarison made in which
Monaglian held one end of the rr^atter and
held the other. Now, can that be evidence?
Mr. CURTIS. I want to ask the witness a
question, ami then I will make au observation
on the objection. [To the witness, j Who
made the report in the Republican which ypu
examined—the one which you examined 'aiici
compared with the repoi-fc in the Democrat ;
who made that report?
Answer. Mr. Walbridge madeihat'report on
Saturday night, September 8, 18GG. It was
published m the Sunday morning ftepublitfan
of September 9, 18G6.
By Mr. Curtis:
Question. Have you looked at the proceed-
ings in this case to see whether that has been
put in evidence?
Answer. The Sunday morning Republican
was mentioned in Mr, Walbridge's testimony, in
which he states that he made one otf twosimple
corrections for the Monday morning Democrat.
Question. Now, I wish to inquire, Mr. Zider,
whether the report which you saw in the files
of the Republican and which.you compared
with the report in the Democrat was the report
which Mr. Walbridge made?
Answer* Undoubtedly it was.
Mr. CURTIS. Now, Mr. Chief Justice, it
is suggested by the learned Manager 
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I will save you &11
trouble. You may put it in as much as you
choose. 1 do not care, on reflection, if you
leave it unread. It is of no consequence.
Mr. CURTIS. We will simply put it into
the case to save time and have it printed.
Mr. ManagerBUTLER. 1 think there should
not be anything printed that is not read. We
have got a very severe lesson upon that.
Mr. CURTIS. We understood you to dis-
pense with the reading.
The CHIEF J UST1CE. If the honorable
Manager desires to have the paper read it will
be read.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I do not desire it
to bo read.
Mr. EVARTS. Is it to go in as evidence,
Mr. Chief Justice, or not.
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Certainly.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. It may go in for
aught 1 care.
Mr. CURTIS. That is all, Mr. Zider.
The paper thus admitted in evidence, con-
taining a memorandum of the differences be-
tween the two reports of President Johnson's
speech at St. Louis, is as follows:
