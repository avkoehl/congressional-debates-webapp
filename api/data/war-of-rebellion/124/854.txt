COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY, EXECUTIVE DEPT.,

Frankfort, September 30, 1863.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington City:

The Seventh Kentucky Cavalry, and some other regiment having one year and over to serve, could be filled by being permitted to take men for the remaining term of their service. My experiences is that it is greatly better to fill old regiments than form new ones out of the same material. I wish authority to mount one battalion of one-year men, to be raised for duty at this place, and to be under my direction and control. With such troops as I can get up of picked men for that service, and under my own orders, I can give ample protection to the U. S. stores at this place and the public property of the State, and can use them to scout for several counties around and put make one battalion so raised and ordered more efficient for good than any regiment now in the service. I want them as Capitol guards, and to be subject to my orders.

Respectfully,

TH. E. BRAMLETTE,

Governor of Kentucky.
