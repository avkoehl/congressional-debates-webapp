the Federals at that point at about 10 o'clock. I was ordered to keep my regiment mounted and move rapidly to the north of the town and prevent the enemy from escaping in that direction. After some three hours' fighting the Federal cavalry surrendered to me, numbering 157. I lost during the engagement 1 man killed and 4 wounded. Recrossed the river on the night of the 16th, marching on in the direction of Independence, engaging a Federal force under command of General Blunt at the crossing of the Little Blue; drove him back through Independence. My loss was 1 man killed, 1 officer and 12 men wounded, and 6 men captured. 22nd, in command of rear guard, Federals pursuing closely. Had 2 men wounded at the crossing of the Big Blue. Fell back and reformed on the west side of Blue. Fought them stubbornly at that point. On the 23rd had 2 men wounded, and the enemy succeeded in capturing Lieutenant-Colonel Young and Captain Davidson, of my regiment, both brave, gallant officers. On the morning of the 25th marched in the direction of Fort Scott, Kans. The Federals attacked our rear guard at sunrise, and a general engagement was the result, which resulted unfavorable to us. I lost in the engagement 4 officers wounded and 7 captured by the enemy, 9 men killed, 17 wounded, and 58 captured. Engaged the enemy again on the evening of the 28th at Newtonia. Had 1 man wounded. This was the last engagement had with the enemy.

My loss on the expedition was as follows: Nine officers wounded and 9 captured; 47 men wounded, 16 killed, 64 captured.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
