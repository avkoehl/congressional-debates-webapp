has commenced his retreat, of which there is no evidence. I am satisfied that Longstreet was re-enforced by Buckner and perhaps Cheatham. I have ordered Colonel Graham to have the enemy followed and watched closely, and to support the advance regiment with any force required.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: Will you do me the favor to address the inclosed letter to my wife, Detroit? I have no pen and ink. As the report that the rebel cavalry had gone toward Kingston pressing axes to block up the roads is not confirmed, but went on toward Knoxville, it seems to me that Longstreet will soon be put in a fix, for he cannot afford to cross the river and fight Sherman, nor to leave the river all open to Sherman and fight Granger; hence, unless his force is greater than we suppose, he must retreat. The move of Ransom to Bean's Station may be intended merely for our benefit, or to keep us from moving down through Clinch Mountain. Since my Indiana boys have done so well, I think we could whip Ransom if we could concentrate upon him; but I think the present disposition of our forces is all that can be desired in the present attitude of affairs.

A citizen here though he heard cannon firing in direction of Clinton yesterday morning, but did not seem confident of it.

Please send my letter home by the most speedy means, and oblige.

Your, respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FOSTER.

GENERAL: Captain Hutchins has made a mistake. I sent him up to ask you to give Garrard his orders, if you had not done so already through Colonel Foster; but it seems that Captain Hutchins confounded Garrard with Graham. I have sent copies of both your instructions to Colonel Graham already, myself adding that he might be delayed by the presence of the enemy on the road, and must act according to circumstances. His last dispatch mentioned a force, and he had sent to re-enforce his scouting party so as to observe it more closely. As there is some fear of further mistake, will you please send me as definite orders as possible to send Colonel Graham to-night?

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FOSTER.
