should be paid for, and would be glad to have authority to do so. Some price be fixed-say, the contract prices of the Ordnance Department for similar arms and equipments. Now that the sources of supply are cut off it is important to get away from the enemy all the arms we can.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., March 3, 1865.

The Ordnance Department has no funds to pay for arms, but you may order the provost-marshal to pay for them at such rate as you may deem proper.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In addition to the thirty-six deserters reported by Wright as coming in last night, Humphreys reports eighteen, Parke five, and Warren has just reported three, making in all sixty-two. Those reported by Warren have just come in, and they stated to Warren that a brigade had been sent to Weldon about three days ago. I will examine into this, and report on their arrival at these headquarters. I have directed the provost-marshal-general to pay for arms and accouterments at the lowest Government contract prices.
