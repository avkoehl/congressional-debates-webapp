Public Lands—Mr. Parker.
Ho. of Reps.
evidence that the General Government has been
actuated by no narrow policy in regard to their
interests I fully appreciate the merits of the
Jiardy and enterprising settlers of the West, and
I would con'mue to piotect their interests as far
as justice to otheis will allow I would secure
the light of pieemption in all cases to the occu
pant, and, if practicable, I would have the sales
confined to actual settleis This could only be
done by passing preemption laws in advance, as
an inducement to settling on the public lands and
requiring continued occupation and cultivation, to
entitle the claimant to preemption There is dan-
ger that immense tracts of the public domain will
fall into the hands of rich capitalists, and that a
dependent tenantiy, with its consequent evils,
will be, to some extent, entailed upon a portion
of the now unsettled lands of the country More
than two hundred and thirteen million acres still
remain unsold in the new States and Territories,
and when this vast domain shall have become
cpveied with a denser population, there will yet
remain more than seven hundred million acies,
lying still further west, to winch the Indian tille
lias not ytt been extinguished
1 have now, Ml Spealvci, answered, I trust
satisfactorily, the arguments of the gentleman
fiomMissoun, [Mi Harbison ] Some attention
is due to the amendment proposed by the honor
able member from Viigiuia, [Mi Robertson ]
Indeed I believe that is tht pnncipal question that
ought to occupy the attention of the House, and
in regard to winch the select committee of one
fiom each State was appointed He pioposes to
strike out the resolution reported by the commit-
tee, and inset t the following

' Mr DuvNmoved toamend the amendment of Mr Ron
ertsov by inserting before the first provino
" 1 irst paying to the fUates m which such lands are sit
uate twelve and a half per ecut ot the proci eds of public
lands sold within such btatcs respectively "
This amendment proposes the adoption of a
system of distribution of the proceeds of the sales
of the public lands, and taken in connection with
the fuither amendment of the gentleman fiom
Indiana, [Mi Dunn,] bears a strong resemblance
to the bill generally known as "Clay's land
bill," which passed both Houses of Congress,
and was returned with objections by the i'rcsi
dent in 1833 That bill was limited to five years
in its operation, and no limitation is proposed by
this amendment With the view of showing
that the people of New York are in favor of a
distribution, the gentleman from Vngmia has le-
ferred to resolutions adopted by the Legislature
in 1831, as being the lasi expiession of its opin-
ion pn this subject Jn this he is mistaken On
the 24th of Maich, 1834, the following resolution
was passed by the Assembly of the State of New
York
' Resolved, That we approve the message of the Presi
dent of the United States dated December 4 1833 .return
in  with his objections to the Senate, the bill entitled ' An
act to appropriate, for a limited time, the proceeds of the
sale  ot the pubhe lands ol the United fttat.es, and to grant
land to certain States ' "
The vote  on the adoption of the reso'ution
was—98 in the affirmative, $ in the negative
Eleven to one opposed to "Clay's land bill "
That is, I believe, the last resolution of the Legis-
lature of New York on the subject of the public
lands
I shall not follow the gentleman from Virginia
into an examination of the resolutions that have
been passed in other States, for the purpose
of ascertaining whether he may not have been
equally misinfoimed in regard to them I will
only remark, that if other States expiessed them-
selves in favor of a distribution several yeatsago,
I doubt much whether it is fair to take that as
the existing sentiment at this time, when the
revenues derived both from lands and customs
are inadequate to meet the wants of the national
Treasury It will be found that such resolutions
were passed when there was a full Treasuiy—
perhaps a surplus—and they cannot be consid
eredas evidence of public sentiment at this time
Itstnkes me as very extraoidmary that such a
proposition should be brought foiwaid at the
present time, when our national Tieasury is ex-
hausted, when there are still unredeemed two or
three millions of fteasuiy notes,issued during
the last year, when we have found it necessaiy,
within the last few days, to extend the act so as
to authorize the issue of moie Tieasury notes to
meet the expenses of the curicnt yeai, and when
the revenue fiom customs is npidly decreasing
under the comptomiseact of 1833 Thegieatost
reductions of the tariff under that act are yet to
take place, and do not reach the minimum until
1842 Yet it is proposed to deprive the General
Government of one entue branch of its revenue,
at a time when it is indispensable to it,s exigen
cíes I do not say, Mr Speaker, that this
movement is made foi political effect, yet [ could
not fail to mark the fact that, simultaneously with
the introduction of the resolution in this House,
at the present session, a distinguished Senator
fiom Kentucky [Mr Ciay] introduced in the
Senate a similar proposition, as an amendment
to the graduation bill Nor could I fail to per
ceive that it was calculated, if it was not de
signed, to affect the apnioaclung piesidenttal con
test I was impiesscci by the letnark made yes
terrlay in tins House by an honornbl gentleman
fiom Maryland, [Mt Howahd,] that the most
lmpoitant bills have always be n acted on by
Confess duung the ycni next piocedmg a pies-
ldential election. It lias been upon such occa
sions that moasmes of policy, fiom which it was
believed strength might be gathered foi an ap-
proaching contest, have been pressed with most
earnestness I do not charge that any such mo
tive has prompted the agitation of this subject at
this time, with a view to piess it still moie zeal
ously at the next session of Congiess, of that I
leave the public to judge, but I do think the prop
osition is calculated to hold out expectations to
the States which, in the pn stnt condition of our
national finances, cannot be realized, that it is
ad captandumm appearance, addressed to the cu
pidity of the States, and that it cannot beai the
test of scrutiny
By íefeience to the last annual report of the
Secretary of the IYeasuty, it will be seen he es
timates the amount of revenue that will probably
be received fi om customs in 1849 at ten or twelve
million dollars     Now it cannot be supposed this
sum will be sufficient to defray the expenses of the
Government   In thepresent condition of the coun-
try, with the most rigid economy in expenditures,
it can haidly be supposed the expenses of the
Government will fall much short of $20,000,000
I If the revenue from the sales of lands in 1842
' should amount to $5,000,000, tint, added to the
highest sum named by theSecietary of theTreas
uiy, would amount to $17,000,000, probably not
I enough to meet the -«ants of the Government
But we are  required to  divide   the  $5,000,000
among the States     Of course, there is at least so
I much deficiency in the National Treasury   How
is this deficiency to be supplied'   By direct tax-
' ation '   The gentleman fiom Virginia has been
silent upon this subject    Surely, if he proposes
1 to take from the public Tieasury the money that
I is needed for national purposes, he ought to in-
struct us ho w to meet the deficiency   Is it intend-
ed to disttiDute among tho States, and to collect
j the same amount by direct taxation from the peo-
I pie '   Or is it prppqsed to collect it by indirect
taxation, by again raising the tariff, and thus
compelling the people to pay the tax by paying
a higher price for every article they find it neces
sary to purchase' It would hardly seem best to
distribute the money, if it is to be immediately
collected back again at an increased expense
Letuslookatthe effect of dividing the ¿5,000,000
under such circumstances In the first place,
twelve and a half per cent is to be deducted and
given to the States in which the lands he This
amounts to §625,000, and leaves for distubution
only ¡¡,4,375,000 Suppose the distnbutive share
of New York to be one sixth, (for the exact pro-
poition is not material to out inquiry,) that State
would receive $729,166 Now, how is it with
supplying the deficiency of $5,000,000 in the
Tieasury' One sixth is to be collected fiom New
York, and this amounts to $833,333 The ex
pense of collecting could not be less than twelve
and a half per cent , and this amounts to $104,165
—making an aggregate to be collected fiom the
people of that State of $937,498-being $208,332
more than the share distnbuttd to that State ¡f
this system is carried into practice, it will be
found that the sum to be collected will be at least
twenty five per cent more than the sum distnb
uted Foi every dollar that is given to the State,
$1 25 is to be collected fiom the hard earnings of
the people
It may be said I have estimated the revenue
from customs in 1842 too low, perhaps it is so
If the importations are laige, it may amount to
$14,000,000, add to this$6,000,000, as the revenue
fi om the sales of lands, and you have $20,000,000,
the sum needed for the expenses of Government
In dividing the sum of $6,000,000, after deducting
$750,000, for the exclusive benefit of the new
States, New York would receive only $875,000,
whilst the State would have to raise, including
expenses of collection, $1,125,000 This is the
economy of the proposed system
Out it may be said the lesolutions piovide for
a deficiency in the icvenue In what manner'
Why, they piovide, that if the íeceiptsfrom cus
toms fill below a given sum, ' and when it shall
be deemed pi opei on that account," theproceeds of
the sties of the lands may be applied bit special
appi oprialion to supply the deficiency, that is,
C ongtess shall have p:>wer by special appiopri
ation so to apply them Congress would have
the powei without this provision, but Congress
might not anticipate the deficiency It might
occur when least expected Congiess, too, has
the powei to call on the States for the money de
posited with them under tho act of 1836, but
it is doubted whether that power will ever be
exercised
There is another objection to this plan Why
should the new States receive twelve and a half
per cent more than the old States out of the pro-
ceeds of these sales' Such a distribution would
be a violation of the most solemn compacts be-
tween the General Government and the States
These lands were to constitute a common fund
for the use and benefit of all the States " accord-
ing to then usual respective proportions of the
general chaige and expenditure," and were " to
be disposed of foi that puipose, and for no other
use or purpose whatsoever " Why this unequal
distribution' It cannot be an allowance for the
supposed more rapid increase of population m
the new States, for it is not proposed to distribute
till after the next census
But why is it necessary to the interests of the
States that distribution should be made' The
money arising from sales of lands has been ap-
plied towards the extinguishment of the national
debt, and to the ordmaiy and extraordinary ex-
penses of Government Does not every State
enjoy the full benefit of Us share, by having it
applied to pay its proportion of these debts and
expenses' As long as the revenue fiom this
source is applied for national purposes, it saves
the necessity of calling on each State to contrib-
ute, and thus every State enjoys the benefit, in
propoition to what would be "its share of the
general charge and expenditure "
If " Clay's land bill" had become a law, what
would now have been the State of the national
finances' By a repoit of the Secretary of the
Treasury, which I now hold in my hand, it ap-
pears there would now have been a national debt
