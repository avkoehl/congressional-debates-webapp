damage was therefore done. The five companies of the Seventy-sixth Ohio were ordered to the top of the ridge on my right to occupy a portion of the line then greatly needing aid. They did most useful and important service there, under command of Major Edward Briggs. Colonel Roberts, of the Thirtieth Iowa, reported that his men were almost out of ammunition. The fortunate arrival of Colonel Montgomery with the Twenty-fifth Wisconsin and the Thirty-fifth New Jersey Regiments, enabled me to relieve the Thirtieth Iowa. I sent the Twenty-fifth Wisconsin immediately forward. They advanced to the crest of the second hill in the most gallant style, and poured in a fire which drove the enemy back to the crest of the next hill, about fifty yards in rear, where they reformed, but did not venture again to advance. Having heard from General Smith that he was hard pressed, I sent the Thirty-fifth New Jersey to his assistance. This part of the engagement lasted about one hour and a quarter. It was remarkable for the vigor of the attack and the stubbornness of the resistance. The enemy's infantry attack having been repulsed, the cannonading was increased and lasted about three-quarters of an hour. During this time the shot and shell fell thick and fast; the artillery practice was splendid, but fortunately little damage was done. The firing ceased about 10 o'clock. As soon as possible I commenced throwing up rifle-pits. These were made sufficiently strong by daylight to render us reasonably secure. About this time (10.30 o'clock) the Twenty-fifth Iowa, Colonel George A. Stone commanding, and the battalion composed of the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first Missouri Volunteers, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph S. Gage, reported to me. The battalion, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Gage, was sent forward to relieve the Twenty-seventh and Third Missouri. These latter regiments, and the Twenty-fifth Iowa Volunteers, were placed in reserve. During the remainder of the night everything remained quiet.

At daylight on the 15th skirmishing commenced and was kept up all day. About 8 a.m. of the 15th the Fifteenth Michigan, Colonel A. E. Jaquith commanding, reported to me. It was placed in a ravine to strengthen the left of my line. This regiment belongs to the Fourth Division, Fifteenth Army Corps. There was 1 man wounded in this regiment. The advantage gained by this position was that it gave a fair view of the bridges in rear of the enemy's position and at short range, so that they could be destroyed, by a vigorous cannonading, in an hour. During the night of the 15th embrasures were put up, and two 20-pounder Parrotts and two Napoleon guns were put in position to destroy the bridges, but during the night the enemy evacuated the works, and our troops marched in on the morning of the 16th. In inclose lists of killed and wounded in my brigade.* The Twenty-sixth Iowa Volunteers, Colonel Milo Smith commanding, which, at the time the other regiments of my brigade advanced to this charge, was out as skirmishers performed very gallant service as such. The list of killed and wounded shows the severity of this service. The Third Missouri lost 1 killed and 11 wounded. The Twenty-fifth Wisconsin lost 24 in killed and wounded. The battalion composed of the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first Missouri lost 1 killed and 2 wounded. The whole loss on my part of the line on the 14th and 15th was, therefore, 16 killed, 103 wounded, and 3 missing. This does not include the loss of the Twenty-sixth Iowa.
