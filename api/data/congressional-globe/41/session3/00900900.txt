THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 2,
tender feelings of some of our friends. Really
the amount of compensation proposed by this
bill is far below what is paid for coastwise
transportation of mails between Baltimore and
New Orleans, in proportion to the distance
traversed. We pay $80,000 upon a contract
for the transmission of the mails from New
Orleans to Key West, and an additional sum
of §30,000 from Key West to Baltimore,
making an aggregate of $110,000 a year for
little more than half the number of milea of
'the route to be traversed under this bill. It
authorises the Postmaster General to contract
with certain parties for conveyance of the mail
by a semi-monthly service, in accordance with
a schedule of departures and arrivals to be fixed
by the Postmaster General. The service con-
templated is semi monthly: one steamer to
leave New Orleans each month, touching at
Tampico, Vera Cruz, and other Mexican ports,
thence, via Havana, to New Orleans; another
to leave the port of New Orleans sailing direct
to Havana, thence by way of Sisal, Campeachy,
Laguna, Taliasco, and other Mexican ports,
and returning to New Orleans.
The contracting parties, within eighteen
months of the date of the contract, are to put
in actual service not les3 than three first-class
iron steamships wholly constructed in the Uni-
ted States, with all modern improvements, to
be subject to inspection by a naval constructor
detailed by the Secretary of the Navy.
It is also provided that the Government of
the United States in ease of war or threatened
danger may take these steamships for its own
use, either by direct purchase or by paying a
sum of money equivalent to a fair interest on
the investment.
The mail contract proposed by this bill is
for a period of ten years, at an expenditure
not exceeding $158,000 per annum for the
first five years and $100,000 for the last five
years.
Sir, this is not a new project. During the last
session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress a bill sim-
ilar to this received favorable consideration. It
had become apparent at that time that we were
losing our trade with Mexico, and that Great
Britain and other countries were getting it.
The importance of this trade to us, the' small
proportion that we got in comparison with
what we were entitled to, and the fact that it
was diverted from us to other and far dis-
tant countries attracted public attention and
excited general comment. The disposition
shown by the Mexican Government to encour-
age commercial intercourse with this coun-
try, her neighbor and her natural ally, also
invested this matter with additional interest.
So general was the disposition to encourage
our commercial relations with Mexico, that
a proposition to grant Government aid met at
that time with very little opposition. We had
a single temporary mail service with the Gulf
ports of Mexico tor several previous years, at
a cost of $80,000 annually, and this dependent
upon the discretion of the Postmaster General.
This service was mostly confined to the winter
months, but, meager as it was, it had done
much to maintain our trade with Mexico. Not-
withstanding this the trade we had enjoyed
with that republic at as early a period as 1835
had during the last succeeding decade rapidly
fallen away.
It needs but the most cursory examination
of the statistics showing the condition of our
trade with Mexico and the other countries
south of us to demonstrate the fact that there
is some potent influence at work which is
rapidly and surely undermining our trade with
thpse countries. Take Mexico for example.
The commercial exchanges between Mexico
and the United States before 1840 had reached
as high as $20,000,000, or nearly one half of
the entire trade of that republic with foreign
countries. While in ten years our Mexican
trade had fallen off very rapidly the trade
between Mexico and European countries had
as rapidly increased. In 1858 the value of for-
eign imports into Mexico amounted to about
twenty-six million dollars, and the exports to
about twenty-eight million dollars; thus mak-
ing a total of foreign exports and imports of
$54,000,000 per annum.
This commerce in 1858 was distributed as
follows, according to the report of Miguel
Lerdo de Tejada, the then Mexican minister
of the treasury. I refer to the statistics of
this date because the most reliable that I
have been able to obtain. They show nsarly
the present distribution of that trade, except
that it has somewhat increased in the aggre-
gate, -while our proportion remains about the
same:
Exchanges with—
England .$33,400,000
United States, (1858)    8,700,000
France    5.500,000
Germany    2,000,000
Spain  1,200,000
Belgium  400,000
Sardinia -    100,000
Guatemala, Ecuador, New Granada, Ven-
ezuela, and Chili  500,000
Island of Cuba  1.200,000
India and' China  1,000,000
Total $54,000,000
I ought to say that the exhibit of the last
year of our export trade with Mexico will
show an increase of five or six million; but
that was owing, in a measure, to an extraor-
dinary importation through the port of New
York of silver bullion to that amount in tran-
sit from Vera Cruz and Tampico, brought
there by the line of Alexander & Co., a line
subsidized by Mexico, Mexico paying them
for a round trip every twenty days $2,200 in
gold, while we do not pay them a cent; nor
do we pay any other line at present.
Thus it appears that England alone monopo-
lized in 1858 over half of the entire foreign
commerce of Mexico, er four times as much
as we. Of the $8,700,000, the amount of
trade with the United States for 1858, a little
over three million dollars consisted of import-
ations from the United States, and about five
millions consisted of exports to the United
States, the United States getting less than one
sixth of the whole foreign trade of Mexico.
The trade of the two ports of Tampico
and Vera Cruz, for the year ending Septem-
ber 80, 1857, was: imports from the United
States, $327,686; imports from other coun-
tries, $1,324,672; exports to the United States,
$451,628; to other countries, $3,530,859. The
entire trade of the port of Vera Cruz with the
United States was $3,868,255, while the entire
trade with Great Britain alone, for the same
year, was $13,559,000.
Mr. Pickett, our consul at Vera Cruz, in a
letter to the State Departme«t of date April
15, 1857, says:
" The duties received at this custom-house during
the year ending December 31,1856, amount, accord-
ing to a statement just published, to $6,127,060. Of
this sum I doubt if one twenty-fourth accrued from
American trade. In 1864 our consul at Vera Cruz
reports the exports at that port at $10,721,961, of
which 8524,336 were to the United States, being less
than one twentieth of the entire amount. In 1868
our consul at Vera Cruz reports the exports at that
port to the United States, Great Britain, France, and
Havana at $6,347,000, of which $667,724 were to the
United States, being about one tenth of the entire
amount."
Great Britain and other countries in monop-
olizing five sixths of the foreign trade of Mex-
ico, most of which justly belonged to us, passed
by our very door, almost through our territory,
conveying it on foreign bottoms over four thou-
sand miles of stormy ocean. But Great Britain
and other countries had not only at that time
absorbed this trade with Mexico, but they
had monopolized, and have since continued to
monopolize, vastly more than their proportion
of the trade of Central and South America and
the West Indies. I refer especially to the
Spanish-American countries lying so directly
south of us, because they are our immediate,
adjacent neighbors; countries which consume
almost every article we manufacture or pro-
duce, and whose productions we use; countries
which are naturally bound to us by every tie
of common interest, of like political institu-
tions, and kindred continental commercial
policy.
Sir, these statistics present questions of vital
importance ; questions that, in my judgment,
no man, be he Senator or Representative, cgp
avoid meeting if he faithfully discharges the
trust reposed in him by his constituents. "•
As I have said, our trade with Mexico !in
1858 was but about one sixth of her entire for-
eign trade. Our trade with Cuba is propor-
tionately much greater, owing to our vast im-
portations of sugar, molasses, and tobacco, and
to the fact that her geographical position places
her in more direct communication with our
coastwise trade between the Atlantic and Gulf
ports.
I ought to say here, in passing, that our trade
with the West Indies amounted last jear to
nearly one hundred million dollars, from which
we derived on duties that went into ourTreas-
ury $30,000,000.
But, sir, how is it with Central and South
America? With Central America our trade
i3 about $2,000,000 out of $12,000,000. With
South America it is less than $60,000,000
out of a total trade of nearly $350,000,000,
or only about one sixth. With some of the
South American countries it is very insignifi-
cant ; as, for instance, with Peru we get less
than $3,000,000 out of $25,000,000; with
Chili we get less than $3,000,000 out of over
$30,000,000; with Brazil we get less than
$31,000,000 out of nearly $150,000,000.
Our trade with Mexico raised to the same
amount that it now is with Cuba, in propor-
tion to population, would be over $300,000,000
per annum; if equal to our present trade with
Brazil it would be nearly $30,000,000, or three
times what it is at present.
Now, sir, at the risk of wearying the Senate,
although I shall endeavor to be as brief as
possible, I desire to refer to a communication
of the Secretary of State under date of July
14, 1870, in corroboration of what I have said
regarding the small amount, comparatively, of
our trade with Brazil. He says:
" With none of the other Spanish-American States
in N«srth and South America are our commercial
relations what they should be. Our total imports
in the year ending June 30.1869, from these coun-
tries were less than $25,000,000, or not one half the
amount from Cuba alone, and our exports for the
same time to them were only $17,850,313; and yet
these countries have an aggregate population nearly
or quite as great as that of the United States; they
have republican forms of government, and they pro-
fess to be and probably really are in political sympa-
thy with us.
"This Department is not able to give with entire
accuracy the imports and exports of Great Britain
with the same countries during the correspond-
ing period. It is believed, however, the following
figures will be found to be not far from correct:
"Imports to Great Britain, $42,820,942; exports
from Great Britain, $40,682,102.
" It thus appears that notwithstanding the greater
distance which the commerce has to travel in com-
ing to and from Great Britain, notwithstanding the
political sympathy which ought naturally to exist
between republics, notwithstanding the American
idea which has been so prominently and so con-
stantly put forward by the Governmentof the United
States, notwithstanding the acknowledged skill of
American manufacturers, notwithstanding theready
markets which the great cities of the United States
afford for the consumption of tropical productions,
the inhabitants of the Spanish-American continent
consume of the products of Great Britain more than
twice the quantity they take of the products of the
United States, and that they sell to us only three
fifths of the amount they sell to Great Britain."
After some farther suggestions regarding the
course our commerce should take he says :
" These suggestions arc, however, applicable to the
British commerce as well as to our own, and they" do
not explain why we, with the natural advantage m
our favor, fall so far behind. The Isthmus of Pan-
ama is thecommon point where the commorce of the
western coasts of Mexico and South America meets.
When it arrives there why should it seek Liverpool
and London rather than New York?"
And he might have added, rather than any
of the cities of the Gulf coast. -
Pardon me, sir, if I trouble the Senate with
another reference. It is to the letter of Mr.
Blow to Mr. Pish, under date of November
