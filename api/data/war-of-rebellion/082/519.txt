HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE P0TOMAC,July 27, 1864-10.20 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The cavalry picketing on the left report the enemy's infantry on the road near the junction of the road from Reams' Station, and that they were numerous in front of our pickets near the Gurley house. General Burnside has been ordered to send two brigades to occupy the entrenchments on your left from the plank road to the Norfolk road, and to picket the line from which Hancock's pickets were withdrawn, yesterday. The commanding officer of the two brigades will be directed to report to you whatever occurs, as well as to these headquarters.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General WARREN:

A report from General McIntosh, commanding cavalry on our left, announces the enemy's infantry in force on the plank road abreast of Lee's Mill, and the running of trains all night. My inference is that the disappearance of Hancock's corps has been mistaken for a raid on the Weldon railroad, and troops have been thrown to meet it. I now except, when real position of Hancock is known, they will try our left and rear. I have ordered Burnside to send two brigades to occupy the works vacated on your left by Hancock.

Major-General.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have 1,900 men on working details to-day, which will considerably diminish the number I can count upon to send off suddenly to any other place. I think we should suspend the siege order for the present.

Major-General.

Major DUANE:

What are these 1,900 men working on?
