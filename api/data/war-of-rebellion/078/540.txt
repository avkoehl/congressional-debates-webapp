ATLANTA, September 30, 1864-9 p. m.

(Received October 1.)

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Commanding Department of the Ohio:

I was surprised when I heard you had gone to Illinois. I had supposed you to be at Knoxville. General Grant suggests that Burbridge should be recalled, and it should be done unless he be beyond call. You should be with your army here or in East Tennessee, and until I know exactly where you are it is impossible for me to calculate as to your whereabouts. I want the whole reserves of Tennessee and Kentucky turned against Forrest, and as soon as General Hood shows his hand I will determine what to do from this point. Hood's army is now on the Chattahoochee and the WEST Point road about Palmetto. Our army is as you left it, except I have sent Thomas back to look after Forrest.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 30, 1864.

General COX, Decatur, Ga.:

GENERAL: I have pretty clear information that Hood has a part of his infantry across Chattahoochee, twenty-four miles south of us, and it may be all. I know that desperate efforts will be made to render our roads useless. Forrest is in Middle Tennessee, but I think will have his hands full, for I have sent you two DIVISIONS of Thomas', and Thomas went up himself yesterday. I may have to make some quick countermoves east and southeast. Keep your folks ready to send baggage into Atlanta, and to start on short notice. Make your preparations quietly without attracting any notice. There are fine corn and potato fields about Covington and the Ocmulgee bottoms. We are well supplied with bread, meat, &amp;c., but forage is scarce, and may force us to strike out. If we make a countermove I will go out myself with a large force and take such a route as will supply us, and at the same time make Hood recall the whole or part of his army.

Yours, &c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

DECATUR, GA., September 30, 1864.
