sand," when it was agreed to

impoi ted, or which mav hereafter be imported
within two years
Mr DENNY moved to amend the resolution
by striking out the " Committee of Ways and
Means," and inserting the " Committee on Man-
ufactures "
Mi CLAYTON was opposed to the amend
ment On formei occasions, similar piopositions
had been ltfernd as he pioposed Anything
having lelation to the imposition or remission of
duties belonged peculiarly to the Committee of
Ways and Means
Mr DENNY concerted it nregulai to send to
the Committee of Ways and Means a matter af
fecting the mdusti y of the country, and which
propeily belonged to the Committee on Manu-
factures This was not strictly a proposition of
revenue, and he hoped his amendment would be
agreed to
Mr SPEIGHT was in favor of the resolution
as it was ongmally offered He would not im-
pugn the motives of the members of the Commit-
tee on Manufactures, but a majority of that com-
mittee was in favor of the protective principle.
The Committee of Waysand Means were charged
exclusively with the care of the revenue and the
manner of raising it They would, therefore,
give to the subject an impartial investigation A3
had been remarked, similar references had been
heretofore made, and he hoped no attempt to
stifle or smothei this inquiry would prevail
Mi PARKER did not regard this proposition
as one of revenue or finance It was not a qu es-
tion whether the íevenue should be íeduced, but
whether it was good policy to admit ceitam arti-
cles free of duty, and how far such a measure
might affect an important branch of home indus-
try The question was a simple one, and fiom
its very teims it was evident that the inquiry
properly belonged to the Committee on Manufac-
tures.
Mr POLK referred to the practice heretofore
in similar cases, toshow that the inquiry properly
belonged to the Committee of Ways and Means
He was indifferent as to the disposition which the
House might make of the proposition
Mr EVERETT, of Vermont, presumed that
the main object of the gentleman from Georgia
was a reduction of the revenue. He referred to
the former practice of the House,and the prece-
dents cited by the gentleman from Tennessee,
[Mr Poltc ] They were not in point, and were
generally cases where articles had been already
imported, and didnot look to future importations,
&c
[The further discussion of the lesolution wa< 
here arrested by a call for the orders of the day ]
