PITTSBURG, PA., August 5, 1864.

(Received 6 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

I last night recommended to the Governor to call out 10,000 men. He has called for 30,000. I have notified him that all presented by him as organized would be armed, subsisted, clothed, and transported by the United States. There being nothing apparently to detain me here, after having made all proper dispositions with General Rowley, I intend leaving for Harrisburg to-night. Nothing later from New Creek since my dispatch of 12 m. to Major-General Halleck.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

The following telegram was received by me from General Kelley this morning:

CUMBERLAND, MD., August 5, 1864-9 a. m.

My forces repulsed the enemy again yesterday at New Creek. General McCausland and Bradely Johnson's forces attacked that post 3 p. m. The fight continued until long after dark. The enemy retreated during the night, leaving their killed and wounded. Their loss severe; ours about 25 killed and 50 wounded. The garrison made a most gallant defense under Colonels Stevenson and Hoy and Major Simpson.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

I am sending infantry and artillery to Uniontown. Will leave to night for Harrisburg.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

GREENCASTEL, August 5, 1864.

Major J. S. SCHULTZE:

Since my last dispatch I have heard from station on Casey's Knob. They say it very small force of cavalry that entered Hagerstown, and that it has not moved out toward Greencastle. I think it is only a reconnoitering party that crossed, though there is evidently quite a force on the other side.

THAYER,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.
