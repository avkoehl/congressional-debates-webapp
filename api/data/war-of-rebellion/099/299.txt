at 7. 30 a. m. The artillery in the same place in the column as in the march to-day. The two brigades of the First Division will march unencumbered as the advance. General Ward will make such disposition of his troops as to protect and assist the whole train.

Notwithstanding the numerous orders already published to the command, in the march of to-day stragglers and foraging parties were found scattered over the whole country far in advance of the head of the column.

Commanders of divisions are requested to adopt such measures as will in future prevent this disobedience of orders.

By command of Brevet Major-General Williams:

CHAS. MOYER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

SELFRIDGE'S HEADQUARTERS,

Sister's Ferry, February 4, 1865.

[General GEARY?:]

GENERAL: I wish to have Kilpatrick's train move with you, and when you reach the corps tell General Williams to divide it among his three divisions. I am very anxious to get your division, Selfridge's brigade, and Kilpatrick's train out to Robertsville to-night, so as to give room for the trains of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Corps to move to this point and load. Please take charge of matters at this point, and see that the trains here do not block up the road and that no time is lost in loading. Selfridge reports one bad piece of road between this point and Robertsville.

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
