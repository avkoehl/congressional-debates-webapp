Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to call your attention to the necessity of cutting down the timber in front of the redoubt on hill, as well as in the ravine on your right. This should be done immediately, while we hold the woods. I would also call your attention to the fact that the detail of Volunteer Engineers did not report until late this morning. Colonel Serrell was informed by me yesterday of the necessity of detailing some of his men.

With much respect, I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

F. U. FARQUHAR,

Captain, U. S. Engineers

MAY 18, 1864-3.30 [p.m.]

Major-General BUTLER:

The force sent out by me found the enemy in considerable strength from Dr. Howlett's house and Ware Bottom Church down to and beyond Widow Clay's house. All the roads leading from the pike are covered by infantry. Their left seems to rest toward Port Walthall Junction. He is in force on all the roads, and is cutting timber near Widow Clay's, either to obstruct roads or with a view to offensive movements. A strong force will be necessary to drive him back. I have withdrawn my force until further orders, as it was too small to effect the purpose. My force attacked them twice, but was unable to dislodge them. I sent a cavalry force around to Port Walthall Junction, with orders to get on the turnpike, which I have not heard from yet.

Yours, &amp;c.,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

By command of Major-General Butler:

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
