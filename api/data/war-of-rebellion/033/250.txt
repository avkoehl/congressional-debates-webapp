SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 25, 1863.

General HERRON:

Have things ready to guard railroad well. Where is Weer? Part of the First had better keep on the Springfield road or come to Rolla. I dare not weaken Rolla till I hear more of reported force coming up between Black and Current Rivers. Vandever has moved from Pilot Knob to attack rebels in Fredericktown. All quiet in other parts of the State.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

General BUFORD, Cairo:

There are rebels on river bank trying to capture boats. It would be better to have boats armed, or let them be escorted by gunboat, if Captain Penncok, U. S. Navy, can furnish one.

[SAML. R. CURTIS,]

Major-General.

CAIRO, April 25, 1863.

General ASBOTH, Columbus, Ky.:

General McNeil, at Cape Girardeau, telegraphs to the naval commander here to send him a gunboat. He expects to be attacked to-day. If the rebels capture a steamboat, they might make a raid into Illinois.

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

I sent re-enforcements to McNeil last night, and the naval commander at Cairo sent two gunboats, which I suppose arrived there in the night. At 2 this morning General McNeil received, by flag of truce, a demand for a surrender in half an hour, signed by order of General Sterling Price, which was declined. It has been said Price was coming up, but I doubt his being present.

11 O'CLOCK.

Firing just commenced.

General DAVIDSON:

General Vandever has left here with all the available force. Colonel Glover has gone with him.

JOHN F. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding.
