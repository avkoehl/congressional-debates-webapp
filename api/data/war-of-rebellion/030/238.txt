HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 25, 1862.

Brig. General S. S. FRY,

Gallatin:

I telegraphed about Harlan's brigade to General Paine, ignorant that you were there. Pray get and carry out that order, and report promptly how soon Harlan's troops will be ready to start.

By order:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Chief of Staff.

GALLATIN, December 25, 1862.

Lieut. Colonel J. P. GARESCHE:

Colonel Harlan's brigade can be ready to move on a few hours' notice. I deem it unsafe to move both General Reynolds and Colonel Harlan from Gallatin with their commands. The place [will] be entirely unprotected. I should think the troops at Bowling Green could be better spared then those here. Let me hear from you again on the subject. Would it not be best to send cavalry in pursuit of Morgan?

SPEED S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

Brig. General S. S. FRY,

Gallatin:

Morgan's delay at Glasgow shows hesitation, which increases probabilities of driving him back on Reynolds. Our forward movement to-morrow makes it still more improbable that anything will be attempted against Gallatin. General prefers sending infantry against Morgan. What force will you have left when Harlan's brigade is gone? Force at Bowling Green is weak.

Recall Steedman's brigade from Pilot Knob immediately to Gallatin.

Brig. General E. A. PAINE,

Gallatin:

General commanding desires you to send Harlan's brigade, with three days' rations, up railroad to Bowling Green and Cave City, to drive Morgan off road and back on Reynolds, who must cut him off. Cars will be provided. Tell them to make as bold a show as possible, and attack him if seen. If intelligence of his force warrants it, they can,
