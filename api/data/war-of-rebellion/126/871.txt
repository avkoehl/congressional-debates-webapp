corn, and which yields annually over 1,500,000 bushels of wheat and 10,000,000 bushels of corn. Nearly 200,000 acres are seeded with other crops-rye, oats, barley, buckwheat, potatoes, and meadow. Total yield annually, 14,000,000 bushels of grain and 120,000 tons of hay--an income on these of more than $10,500,000.

In addition to the agricultural resources are the mining and manufacturing interests of no small importance. The former is yearly becoming of greater significance. Perry and Hocking Counties, far inferior in agricultural products, are rich in undeveloped mineral resources, and are fast competing in wealth with other seemingly more favored portions of the district.

Excepting the manufacture of whisky, flour, and leather, little else beyond local consumption is produced. The revenue paid on whisky for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864 (most of which was assessed at 20 cents per gallon), amounted to $558, 183.36.

Physical.-The physical development of the inhabitants is commensurate with the demand for labor and the agricultural and mineral resources; and the soldier from this class of yeomanry should, from habits of life, be able to endure great fatigue; and the Government may well accept with pride and satisfaction the men elected to fill the quotas of this district, as they have been furnished from the best physical development produced in this locality. (See Table Numbers 3.) Although the number examined shows nativities of thirty nine States a countries, a great majority are natives of Ohio, and have enjoyed a country life, not of an easy, indolent, or luxurious character, but one subject to and requiring great physical endurance. In the heat of summer and cold of winter they have been accustomed to active laborious duties.

Of the total number, 2,568 were farmers and farm laborers, and 572 including other occupations; 2,204 natives of Ohio, and 936 including the natives from all other States and countries.

The average physical development of the natives of Ohio is equal to that of all other States and countries collectively, although many were youthful, reducing the average age of those accepted to twenty-three seven-tenths, or five years below the average of those from other States and countries; and the ratio rejected per 1,000 examined is considerably less than other nativities collectively.

(Table 4.)

Ratio rejected per 1,000 examined, recruits and substitutes:

Natives of Ohio ............................................ 353.1

Other States and countries ................................. 480.9

Total number ............................................... 391.4

The greatest number exempted for physical disability under any one section of paragraph 85, Revised Regulations, or for disability referred to therein (Table Numbers 2), has been for hernia; and, contrary to the commonly received opinion, more cases of right than left inguinal hernia are met with.
