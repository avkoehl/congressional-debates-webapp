E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

WARRENSBURG, MO., May 29, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I respectfully ask, if the rebels move from Arkansas in force, will I receive support from the east, or shall I look to General Curtis, and make my dispositions with that expectation? His reply to my telegram, copy of which I sent to you, was that if absolutely necessary General McKean would send me a regiment. This is very vague.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., May 29, 1864

Major-General ROSECRANS, Commanding:

I have ordered Seventh Regiment Missouri State Militia to concentrate at this place, leaving the Fourth with Colonel Hall, in command of the country east of the Johnson County line. This will be a nucleus for a more general concentration if it becomes necessary. The present field of guerrilla operations is north and west of here, and with their increased numbers, larger scouts will be required than I have been sending out. This renders a larger reserve necessary.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SEDALIA, MO., May 29, 1864

(Received 2.55 p.m.)

General BROWN, Warrensburg, Mo.:

Major Kelly with his command got in this morning and has gone into camp here.

J. F. PHILIPS,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 29, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forty rebels crossed the stage road near the California House on the 27th instant, moving north. I think it important that Houston, in Texas County, should be occupied by troops. Shelby's command is north of the Boston Mountains that I can learn.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
