SUFFOLK, VA., May 1, 1863.

General D. BUTTERFIELD, Army of the Potomac:

There may be portion of Longstreet's troops with your opponents. If so, they are the first installments. Deserters and contraband who came in yesterday from Hood's and Pickett's divisions agree in all points with others that have fallen into our hands. The pickets of Corse, Garnett, and Law are on all the roads now. There have been heavy rains here for a few days. Longstreet had tow railroads in about 16 miles of his line.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, May 1, 1863.

Major General JOHN J. PECK:

Among the many marvels of this war are the impossibility on out part of getting information as to the enemy and the facility with which he ascertains everything as to us. I allude especially to General Butterfield's dispatch to you stating that Hood's and Pickett's divisions are in front of the Army of the Potomac.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., May 1, 1863.

General DIX:

There may be some regiments of Longstreet's on their way. Probably they are the first installments. His line was only about 15 or 16 miles from his two railways. If so, it shows that the rebels knew of Hooker's moves before we did. Deserters and contrabands came in yesterday, giving the same reports as heretofore, and appear entitled to full credit. If Lee has called for him his necessities must be pressing.

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, May 1, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Have just examined one of the deserters of Garnett's brigade, recently from North Carolina. He says about what all have said from the outset as to the force and design. His captain said Longstreet would try to take Suffolk, and that he had telegraphed for re-enforcements.
