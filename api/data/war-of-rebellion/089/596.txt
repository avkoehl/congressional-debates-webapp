Bonham, agent of the Stante of Pennsylvania, and others; in the cases of Miles and Carrigan, on the latter of Brigadier-General Miles and other officers and men.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have nothing particular to report beyond the usual picket-firing on the Second Corps front. Signal officers report a movement of the enemy toward their within their lines. I send you the dispatches.

I am not able to judge from them that this movement is anything but a change a position in some of the troops. Corps commanders have been notified to be on the qui vive, and if anything further occurs it will be duly reported. I have this morning turned over to Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, from Washington, the political prisoners arrested in this army, to be taken by him, under the orders of the War Department, to Washington.
