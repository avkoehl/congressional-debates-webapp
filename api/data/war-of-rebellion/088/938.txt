HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 20, 1864

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Do you intend that my pickets are to be put as far out as the cavalry are? I so understand from the order. Please tell me where Davenport Church is. I do not find it on any map I have.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 20, 1864-3 p.m. (Received 3.15 p.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

It is intended by General Meade that your pickets should be about on the line of the cavalry pickets, which it is understood cross the plank road near Gary's Church. Davenport Church is on the road from Mount Zion Church to Lee's Mill, about one mile and a half southwest of the Norfolk railroad.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 20, 1864. (Received 7.30 p.m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

As my picket-line is about four miles in front of my troops, I think it would be well to have one of my brigades out near the intrenchment. As the picket-line is situated now, if a break occurs we might not hear of it until the enemy are in our camps, as the shots could not be heard.

Major-General.
