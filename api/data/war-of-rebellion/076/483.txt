Captain CASE:

Can see three regiments in rear of rebel main line. One about south 30 degrees west, near the fort on their right, one in front of the medical college, and one west near the fort where the large guns are. They are pitching tents and putting up shelters as though they had just moved in. In other parts of the line everything seems to be same as usual. Can see seven battle-flags. Some firing on the skirmish line.
