FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,Saint Louis, Mo., October 25, 1864-2.15 p. m.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, in the Field:

Please give directions to have the first Confederate major captured forwarded to me without delay. It is now almost certain that Major Wilson and his men were murdered, and I propose, on satisfactory proof of same, to shoot instantly their equivalent of rebels, in accordance with orders heretofore given me. If not prospect of receiving a rebel major soon as prisoner, will you, as before suggested, telegraph to the Commissary-General of Prisoners to send me one now under his charge, belonging to the command of any of the Confederate leaders now in Missouri, for execution.

JOSEPH DARR, JR.,

Acting Provost-Marshal-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, October 25, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS, Chief of Staff:

The bodies of Major Wilson and six others, supposed to be enlisted men, have been found fifteen miles southwest of Washington, near the place where Captain Dinger says he saw Wilson placed by an officer of the day under guard, with instructions to the officer commanding the guard to deliver him to Tim Reves. Wilson's body was pierced with many bullets, and when found was disfigured and mutilated by hogs. On his person were found many private papers, and some orders from me, identifying his body beyond all possible doubt. There is no Confederate major in our possession here, except wounded in hospital; the Commissary-General of Prisoners will probably not turn over one from Alton to you for execution; I therefore earnestly recommend that fourteen privates of Price's command be executed in retaliation-eight for Wilson and six for his murdered associates.

Brigadier-General MILLER, Mineral Point:
