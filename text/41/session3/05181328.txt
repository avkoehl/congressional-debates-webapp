THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 17,
paid to heads of other divisions in the Secretary's
office, and all his reasonable traveling expenses, or
mileaec at the rate of ten cents per mile when on
official duty.
Mr. BOLES. My amertdmentproposesthat
this work shall be done by a chief of division,
instead of creating a new bureau in the Treas-
ury Department, with an officer at the head
of the bureau with a salary of $3,500 a year.
I hope this amendment will be adopted. It
has the indorsement of some of the supervis-
ing board of inspectors, and I think it was
drawn up by some of them.
Mr. CONGER. If it was drawn up by the
supervising board of inspectors and has their
approval they failed to make any mention
of it ih their report. The provisions of this
bill meet the approval of the Secretary of the
Treasury. Heretofore this service has been
rambling about from one head of a division to
another, until "the Secretary desires that there
shall be a supervising inspector general who
shall be responsible to the country for carrying
out these laws. That can be done at a less
expense than heretofore, and at a less expense
than would be required by the gentleman's
substitute.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. The idea
of putting this matter under the charge of a
clerk is simply absurd.
Mr. BOLES. One word more.
Mr. CONGER. Is further debate in order?
The SPEAKER. It is not, except by unan-
imous consent.
Mr. CONGER. Then I object.
The question was taken upon the substitute
moved by Mr. Boles; and it was not agreed to.
The motion of Mr. Negley, to strike out
section sixty-three, was not agreed to.
Mr. ROOTS. I want to call the attention
of the House to section forty-three of this bill.
It provides that before a man can obtain com-
pensation for any damages he may sustain by
explosion, fire, collision, or other cause on a
steamboat, he must prove that that damage
resulted from the neglect or failure of the
master or owner of the vessel to comply with
the provisions of this bill. j
Mr. FINKELNBURG. That has been j
struck out.
Mr. ROOTS. Well, if that has been struck
out,, let me refer to the remainder of the sec-
tion, which is no less reprehensible. It pro-
vides thatâ€”
Any person sustaining loss or injury through the
carelessness, negligence, or willful misconduct of any
captain, mate, engineer, or pilot, or his neglect or
refusal to obey the provisions of law herein pre-
scribed as to navigating such steamers, may sue such
captain, mate, engineer, or pilot, and recover dam-
ages for any such injury caused as_ aforesaid by any
such captain, mate, engineer, or pilot.
This proposes that the remedy of the injured
party shall be by suit against the captain, mate,
engineer, or pilot, from whom, in all proba-
bility, not one cent could be collected. 1 think
the section should be struck out, so that injured
parties may have their remedy at common law
against owners of vessels as common carriers
for all damages except those which may result
from the act of God or the common enemy.
Mr. CONGER. If the gentleman could
have restrained himself a moment L would
have told him that the provisions of this sec-
tion, so far as they conflict at all with the
principles of the common law, have been
struck out by the committee.
Mr. NEGLEY. Then why did not the gen-
tleman have the bill recommitted and printed,
so that the House might understand what the
committee propose?
Mr. ROO rs. I would like to hear the forty-
third section read as modified by the com-
mittee, for I am very suspicious in regard to
that section. For, like the heathen Chinee,
at least there is in it something "peculiar."
[Laughter. ]
The SPEAKER. The section will be read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Sec. 43. And be it further enacted. That whenever
damage is sastained by any passenger or his baggage
from explosion, fire, collision, or other cause, the
master and the owner of such vessel, or either of
them, and the vessel, shall be liable to each and
every person so injured to the full amount of dam-
age, if it happens through any neglect or failure to
comply with theprevisionsof law herein prescribed,
or through known detects or imperfections of the
steaming apparatus or of the hull; and any person
sustaining loss or injury through the carelessness,
negligence, or willful misconduct of any captain,
mate, engineer, or pilot, or his neglect or refusal to
obey the provisions of law herein prescribed as to
navigating such steamers, may sue such captain,
mate, engineer, or pilot, and recover damages for
any such injury caused as aforesaid by any such cap-
tain, mate, engineer, or pilot.
Mr. ROOTS. I consider it still very objec-
tionable, and do hope it will be entirely stricken
out.
Mr. NEGLEY. I movetorecommitthebill.
Mr. DICKEY. I move that the "bill be laid
on the table.
Mr. ROOTS. I hope the bill will not be
laid on the table. I appeal to the House in
the interest and in behalf of the people of the
great Mississippi valley, let us have some bill
for the better protection of life.
The motion of Mr. Dickey wasnotagreed'to.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs upon
the motion of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr. Negley,] to recommit the bill.
Mr. .NEGLEY, With authority to report
at any time.
The SPEAKER. Authority to report at any
time requires unanimous consent.
Mr. KELSEY. I object.
Mr. CON GER. I hope the bill will not be
recommitted ; the committee has spent months
of faithful labor in the endeavor to perfect it.
Mr. NEGLEY. I demand the previous
question on the motion to recommit.
Mr. HOGE. I move that the House adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to.
- The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the motion of Mr. Negley, to
recommit the bill, was not agreed to.
The substitute reported by the committee
was, as amended, agreed to.
The bill, as amended by the adoption of the
substitute, was ordered to a third reading; and
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. CONGER moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. HOGB. I move that the House adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at four o'clock and thirty minutes p.m.) the
House adjourned.
