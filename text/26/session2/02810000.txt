I               MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT.
f        The following message from the President of the
l     United States was received by Mr. Yan Buren, his
(•     Private Secietary
I    Fellow-citizens of the Senate
*                           and House of Representatives •
•r        Our devout gratitude is doe to the Supreme Be-
ing for having graciously continued to our beloved
I    country, through the vicissitudes of  another year,
the invaluable blessings  of health,  plenty, ana
peace.   Seldom has this favored land been so ge-
nerally exempted from the ravages of   disease, or
I     the labor of the husbandmaB more amply reward-
|    ed; and never before have our relations with other
I    countries been placed on a more favorable  basis
l^ than that which they so happily occupy at th's criti-
cal conjuncture in, ihe affairs of the world    A   ri-
gid and persevering abstinence  from all interfer-
ence withthe domestic  and  poli'ical relations of
Other States, alike due to the genius  and  distinc-
* Uve character of our Government and to the prin-
ciples by which it is directed, a faithful observance,
in the management of oar foreign relations, of the
practice of speaking plainly, dealing justly, and
requiring truth and justice in  return, as   the best
conservatives of the peace of nations, a strict   im-
partiality in oui mamfesta'ions of friendih'p, in
the commercial privileges we  concede, and  those
~   vie require from o her-,   the^e, acco-npamed  by a
U, 4aaSP&W°  as> pron pt to ma a'ain, in every emer-
gency, our o wa rights, as we   rea from principle
j.   averse to the mvis-ion of those cf others, have given
fi>   out   country aul Government a standing in
the great family of nations, oí which we h<ivp just
cause to be proud, and the  advantages   of which
are experienced by our citizens   throughout every
portion of the earth o which their enterprising
and adventurous spirit may carry tnem     Pew, if
any,remain insensible to th¡*  value ot our friend-
ship, or ignorant of the terms on which  it can be
acqStred, and by   which  it can  alone  ba  pre-
set ved.
A eenes of questions of long standing, diffimiit
itt their adjustment, and important m their conse-
quences, in which ths rights of our citizens and
the honor ot the countiy were deeply involved,
have, m the cojrse of a fsw years, (the most of
them during th  suscesfu! administration of my
Wtmediate predecessor,) betn brought to a satis-
1$$®>ty conclusion, an i the most important of those
te&Httiag are, I am happy to believe, in a fair
w*ay of being  peedily and «stisfactouly ad-
jured.
With all the powers of the world our relaütns
are those of honorable peace. Since your adjourn-
ment, nothing serious has occurred to interrupt
or threaten this desirable harmony. If clouds have
towered above the other hemisphere, they have not
east their portentous shadow  upon our happy
shares. Bound by no entangling al'iance«, yet
linked by a- common nature and interest withthe
other nations of mankind, our aspirations are for
jj e preservation of peace, in *s hose sol l and civil-
izing triumphs all may participate with a generous
emulation Yet it behooves us to be prepated for
any event, and to be always ready to maintain hose
just and enlightened princioles of nauonal inter-
course, for which this Government has e/er con-
tended In the shock of contending empires, it is
only by assuming a resolute bearing, and clothing
themselves with defensive armor, that neutral na-
tions can maintain their md"pendent rights
The exci ernent which grew out of the territorial
controversy between the United States and Great
Britain having in a great measure subsided, it is
hoped that a favorable period   is   approaching for
final settlement. Both Governments must now
be convinced of the dangers with which the ques-
tion is fraught; and it must be 'hen d°sire, as it is
their interest, that this perpetual cause of irritation
should be removed as speedily a^ practicable. In
my last annual message jou were informed that
the proposition for a commission of exploration and
survey promised by Great Britain had been re-
ceived, and that a counter project, including alco a
provision for the certain and linal adjustment of
the limits in dispute, was th n before the British
Government for its consideration. The answer of
that Government, accompanied by additional
propositions of its own, was received, through
Us minister here, smee y out separation These
were promptly ens'dered, micj  s were
deemed cerrect m p*incpl->, ar>d con istent
with a due regard to the jus' rights of ihe
United States and of die State o Mame, cuiicuired
in, and the reasons for dissecting frori iht residue,
with an additional suggestion on our part, commu-
nicated by th* Secretary of State to Mr Fo.< Ti.ai
Minister, not feeling hira«elf sufficiently in traced
upon some of ih? pwms rai ei in the d •■cu'-ion,
frit it to be his duty to re er the mitfer to his own
Government 'or its further decision. Having now
been for some time under us advisement, a speedy
answer may be confident!} exp'c'eci From ÚV
character of the point  still m differew*, and the
undoubted disposition of bota parties to bring the
niatrsr to an early conclusion, I look with entue
confidence to a prompt and satirfactoiy teimma-
tion of the negotiation. Th>te commiss oncr& "«ere
appointed sboitly after the adjournment of Con-
gress, under ths act of the last session providing
for the exploration and survey of tiif line which
separates the States of Maine and New Hamp hire
from the Bri'ish Prcv.nces, they have been ac-
tively employed until their piigre<iwas interrupted
by the inclemency of the season, and will resume
their labors as soon as practicable in the ensuing
year
It is understood that then respective examina-
tions will throw new light upon the subject in con-
troversy, and serve to remove any erroneous im-
pressions which may have been maít elsewhere
prejudicial to the rights oi t> e United States, L
was, among ctbe. ica on",  i a a vits of preven'
ing the embarrass nents which, in our peculiar sys
rat nf government, impede ami oomp,>cat<  nego-
tiations involving ihe 'erntoml rights of a State,
that I thought it my dnty, as you have been in-
formed on a previous occasion, to propose to the
British Government, through its Minister at
Washington, that early steps should be taken to
adjust the points of difference on the lme of
boundary from the entrance of Lake Sopenor to
the most northwestern point of the Lake of the
Woods, by the arbitration of a friendly power, in
conformity with the seventh article of the treaty of
Ghent No answer has yet been returned by the
British Government to this proposition.
With Austria, Prance, Prussia, Russia, and the
remaining powers of Europe, I am happy to in-
form you our relations continue to be of the most
friendly character With Belgium, a treaty of
commerce and navigation, based upon liberal prin-
ciples of reciprocity and equality, was concluded in
March last, and having been ratified by the Bel-
gian Government, will be duly laid before the Se-
nate. It is a subject of congratulation that it pro-
vides for the satisfactory adjustment of a long
standing question of controversy, thus removing the
only obstacle which could obstruct the friendly and
mutually advantageous intercourse between the
two nations. A messenger has been despatched
with the Hanoverian treaty to Berlin, where, ac-
cording to stipulation, the ratifications are to be
unchanged I am happy to announce to you that,
after many delays and difficulties, a treaty of com-
merce and navigation between the United State 
and Portugal, was cone uded and signed at Lisbon,
on the 26th ot August last, by the plenipotentiaries
of the two Governments In stipulations are
founded upo.i those anficiptes of mutual liberality
and advantage whicii the United States have al-
ways sought to make the basis of tneir intercourse
with fore gi potters, and it is hoped they will tend
to foster and strengthen the ccrcnerual intercourse
of the two countr es

Tne commissioners appmted under the conven-
tion for the adjustment oí claims of citizens of
the United S'ates upon Mexico having met and
organized at Washington, in August last, the pa-
pers in the possession of the Government, relating
to those claims, were communicated to the board.
The chums not embraced by thdt convention are
now the subject ol negotiation between the two
Governments, through the medium of our Minister
at Mexico.
Noth^g has occurred to dis'url ths harmony of
our relations wi h the diffeient Governments of
SouthAmerua I regret, however, to be obliged
to inform you tha tt>e claims of our cit zens upon
the late Republic of Colombia have not yet been
satisfied by the separate Governments into which it
has been re oived
