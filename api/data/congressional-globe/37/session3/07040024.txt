Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
may be either repealed or reduced in rate at that
session without injury to the public service or the
public credit. Possibly, also, some comparatively
unimportant changes may be indicated as useful
bjefore the close of the present session.
The aStual and estimated receipts under these,
laws for the current fiscal year, as already stated,
will amount, under the tariff act to the sum of
$68,041,736 59, and under the internal revenue
law to |85,456,303 73. The receipts from all other
sources, exclusive of loans, as estimated, will
reach §13,953,758 47, making a general aggregate,
including $13,043,546 81, balance from last year,
of $180,495,345 60, and leaving to be provided
from loans, in some form, §608,063,432 02. _
The laws of the second class limit the issue
of United States notes, exclusive of the contin-
gent reserve for deposits, to $250,000,000; limit
the amount receivable on temporary deposit to
$100,000,000; and limit the issue of five-twenty
sixes to §500,000,000. The issue of certificates of
indebtedness and of fractional currency is unlim-
ited by legislation.
The amount of United States notes, including
notes receivable for customs, already issued and
in circulation, or in the Treasury to the credit of
disbursing officers or of the Treasurer, was, on the
1st instant, $222,932,111. There yet remains,
therefore, under the law an authority to issire the
further sum of §27,067,889. The amount received
on deposit, including coin and estimating for the
last day of November, is $79,798,650. The further
sum ot §'20,201,350 may therefore yet be received.
The issue of fractional currency has reached the
sum1 of §3,884,800. The best lights lead to the
estimate that before specie payments can be re-
sumed not less than §40,000,000 will be required
by the wants of the community. The sum of
§36,115,200, not yet issued, may therefore be
counted on as an additional resource! It is not
easy to determine what further payments can be
made in certificates of indebtedness, but it seems
probable that payments in thaL form may be safely
carried totheamountof§100,000,000. These pay-
ments have already reached $87,363,241 65, and
tlie additional sum of §12,636,758 35 may there-
fore be paid in that way. What can be justly
expected from conversions under the act author-
ising the issue of five-twenty sixes, that is to say,
from exchanges by holders of United States notes
for these bonds, at par, cannot be stated with much
certainty. The amount received from this source
from the date of the act to the 1st instant, esti-
mating for part of the last week in November, is
§23,750,000. It may reasonably be expected that
§35,000,000 will lie received, if the act remains
unmodified, during the remainder of the fiscal
. year. The aggregate of nil these sums, namely,
§1,11,021,197 35, constitutes the total of resources
available for the current, year under existing laws,
except through sales, regarded as impracticable
under the act authorizing their issue, of the live-
twenties at their market value.
These credit resouices, with the actual receipts
from like sources, added to revenue in all foims,
may supply the Treasury with $511,646,259 96.
There remains a balance of disbursements of
§276,912,517 66 to be provided for.
How ?
The easiest mode doubtless would be an issue
of the required amount in United States notes;
but such an issue, especially in the absence of
pro per restrictions on corporate circulation, would,
in the judgment of the Secretary, be as injurious
as it would be easy. The addition of so vast a
volume to the existing circulation would convert
a currency, of which the benefits have thus far
greatly outweighed the inconveniences, into a
positive calamity. Its consequences would be in-
flation of prices, increase of expenditures, aug-
mentation of debt, and ultimately disastrous do-
feat of the very purposes sought to be attained
by it.
To a certain extent, however, and under cer-
tain circumstances, a limited additional issue of
United States notes may, perhaps, be safely and
advantageously made.
The .Secretary does not concur in the opinion
entertained by some, whose ability and experience
command deserved respect, that the aggregate cur-
rency of the country, composed of United States
notes and notes of corporations, is at this moment
greatly in excess of legitimate demands for its
employment. Much less does he concur in an-
other opinion, not unfrcquently expressed, but
expressed in his judgment without due consider-
ation, that any actual excess is due to the issues of
United States notes already in circulation.
It is true thatgcjld-commands a premium in notes;
in other words, that to purchase a given amount
of gold, a greater amount in notes is required.
But it is also true that, on the suspension of specie
payments, and the substitution for coin of United
States notes, convertible into six per cent, specie
bonds as the legal standard of value, gold became
an article of merchandise, subject to the ordinary
fluctuations of supply and demand, and to the ex-
traordinary fluctuations of mere speculation. The
ignorant fears of foreign investersin national and
State bonds, and other American securities, and'
the timid alarms of numerous nervous individuals
in ourowncountry,prompted largesacrificesupon
evidences of public and corporate indebtedness in
our markets, arid large purchases of coin for re-
mittance abroad or hoarding at home. Taking
advantage of these and other circumstances tend-
ing to an advance of gold, speculators employed
all the arts of the market to stimulate that tend-
ency, and carry it to the highest point. This
point was reached on the 15th day of October.
Gold sold in the market at a premium of thirty-
seven and five eighths per cent.
That this remarkable rise is not due wholly, or
even in greatest part, to the increase of the cur-
rency, is established beyond reasonable doubt by
considerations now to be stated.
First: The whole quantity of circulation did
not, at the time,greatly, if atall^exceed the legit-
imate demands of payments. On the 1st day of
November, 1861, the circulation of United States
notes, including credits to disbursing officers
and to the Treasurer of the United States, was
§15,140,000. Oil the 1st day of November, 1862,
it was, with like inclusions, §210,104,000. Of cor-
porate notes, on the 1st of November, 1861, the
circulation in the loyal States was, according to
the best estimates, §130,000,000; on the 1st of No-
vember, 1862, it was §167,000,000. The coin in
circulation, including the coin in banks, was prob-
ably not less, on the 1st of November, 1863, than
§210,000,000. On the 1st of November, 1862, the
coin had been practically demonetized and with-
drawn from use as currency or as a basis for cur-
rency, and is therefore not estimated. The aggre-
gate circulation of the loyal States, therefore, was,
at the first date, §355,140,000; and at the second
only §377,104,000.
Secondly: The whole, or nearly the whole, in-
crease in the volume of the currency which has
taken place was, it is believed, legitimately de-
manded by the changed condition of the country
in the year between the two dates. The activity
in business which, at the close of that year, had
taken the place of the general stagnation which
marked its beginning, and the military and naval
preparations and movements which had vastly
augmented the number and amounts of payments
to bo made in money have, it is believed, legiti-
mately demanded nearly or quite the whole of it.
That such is the case maybe reasonably in-
ferred from the fact that the prices of many of the
most important articles of consumption have de-
clined or not materially advanced during the year.
Wheat, quoted at §1 38 to §1 45 per bushel on the
1st of November, 1861, was quoted at§l 45to§l 50
on the 1st of November, 1862. Prime mess pork,
on the 1st of November, 1S61, was quoted at §15
to $15 50 'per barrel, and on the 1st of November,
1362, at §12 50 to jjl3. Corn sold on the 1st of
November, 186], at 62 to 63 cents per bushel, and
on the 1st of November, 1862, at 71 to 73 cents.
A comparison between the prices ofhay, beef, and
some other staplesof domestic produce at the two
dates, exhibits similar conditions ofactual depres-
sion in price or moderate rise.
Thirdly: It is, perhaps, still more conclusive
against the theory of great redundancy that, on
the 15th day of October, when the aggregate act-
ual circulation, national and coiporate, was about
§360,000,000, the premium on gold was thirty-
seven and five eighths; whereas, on the 29th day
of November, when the circulation had increased
by more than §20,000,000, the premium on gold
was twenty-nine to thirty per cent.,
But if the fact of considerable redundancy in
circulation be conceded, it by no means follows
that it is the circulation of United States notes
which is redundant.
It must be remembered that the law confines na-
tional payments and receipts to coin and notes of
the United States. Officers of the Treasury, offi-
cers of the Army and Navy, all officers of all de-
partments, must observe and enforce this law.
For all payments to be made in behalf of the United
States, in case of inability to obtain coin, United
States notes must be issued. Tt is indeed, the duty
of the Legislature to see that the purchasing power
of these notes is kept as nearly as possible equal to
the purchasing power which gold would have had
if specie payments had been maintained; but the
issue and use of the notes is unavoidable, and the
Government can resort to borrowing only when
the issue has become sufficiently large to warrant
a just expectation that loans of the notes can ba
had from those who hold or can obtain them at rates
not less advantageous than those of coin loans be-
fore suspension. The difficulty which the takers
of the recent loan of §13,613,450 found in obtain-
ing United States notes with which to meet their
engagements to the Treasury is very instructive
on this head. It points, indeed, directly to the
conclusion that loans of United States notes, in
sufficient amounts to meet the disbursements of
the Government, could not now be obtained at
rates which a due regard to the interests of the tax-
payers would permit the Secretary to accept.
Whatever may be said of the aggregate ciicula-
tion, it cannot, then, be successfully maintained
that the circulation of United States notes'is ex-
cessive. When extended to the limits authorized
by existing laws, it will be no larger than the
wants of the people and the Government impera-
tively demand. t
If there be a considerable redundancy then; if
there be a considerable real depreciation of the cir-
culation—which is by no means admitted—what
has caused the redundancy and the depreciation?
The cause of all that exists is easily found in
the statements of the banking corporations. The
circulation of corporate notes increased during the
year ending on the 1st of November, 1862, from
§130,000,000 to §167,000,000. During the same
time the volume of deposits, which answer very
many of the purposes of circulation, had swelled
from §264,000,000 to §344,000,000. The greater
portion of this increase took place within the last
seven months.
The augmentation of deposits always accom-
panics increase of circulation. Together they
stimulate loans, and arc, in turn, stimulated by
the desire of the interest derived from loans. As
might have been anticipated, loans increased,
though not equally, with the circulation and de-
posits. From §607,000,000 on the 1st day of
November, 1861, they had grown to §677,000,000
on the 1st day of November, 1862.
Here is an obvious and sufficient explanation of
whatever undue expansion may have taken place.
The Secretary has already expressed the opinion
that the circulation is not greatly redundant, and
that no considerable depreciation of currency has
actually occurred. He thinks itsufficiently proved,
however, that whatever there may be of either is
fairly attributable not to the increase of United
States notes, but to the increase of bank circula-
tion and deposits.
It is to be observed that no law compelled and
no public necessity required any enlargement of
the volume of currency by the banks. On the
contrai y, there aie, in some of the States, positive
enactments by which the increase of circulation
during suspension is prohibited; and the princi-
ple embodied in them is so obviously just that
well-managed institutions, when obliged to sus-
pend, almost invariably, without the constraint of
any law, reduce their circulation instead of aug-
menting it. In obedience to this principle, a re-
duction of bank circulation actually took place
after the suspension in December. It was only
when United States notes, having been made a
legal tender, were diverted from their legitimate
use as currency and made the basis of bank circu-
lation, that the great increase of the latter began.
It was purely voluntary; prompted, doubtless,
by the desire of extending accommodations to
business as well as by the expectation of profit.
