This amendment was adopled
Mr TAPPAN objected to the fifth section as unnecessary apd

Mr SMITH, of Connecticut, objected to the language of tne
billas not being specific with legard to the objects m view
Th(3 language would be the subject of endless controveí-ay He
objected alcO to the authon'y assumed of transferring children

Mi BENTON objected to this corporation, as he would to

GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
The House proceeded to the consideration oí the bill making
appropriation for ihe civil and diplomatic expenses of Gov-
ernment for the year 18_2, the pending question still being on
concuinng with the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union in certain amendments made thereto, and on ordeung
the bill to be engrossed for a third reading
Of these amendments a number (under the opeiation of the
prevous question) had been heretofore (m the aggregate) con-
curred m, and certain others, to which exception had been.
tauen, had been laid agide for a separate question.
Ard the question being on the said amendments—
Mr CLIFFORD rose and submitted the following point of
order
"That whereas, on the 15th day of February last, the House,
on motion of Mr Gentry, of Tennessee, adopted the following
i esol ution, to wit ' To instruct the Committee of the Whols on
the state oí the Union, to which has been referred the House
bill Ko 74, to strike out every item of appropriation which ia
not aufhonzed by existing laws  
"And wneieassectnn or ltemiso 17, in the printed bill, was
stricken out in pursuance of that order, without examination cr
debate, it is not now competent ior the House to reinstate it un-
til that instiuction is repealed, and ibe section has been consid-
ered in committee 1 Because the House, and not the com-
mittee directed the clause to be stricken out, 2 Because it
wouldoperateasafraud upon the right of free discussion in.
the committee, 3 Because that clause is no part of the bill
reponed from the committee, having been stricken out by tl o
ordei of the House 4 Because it is a violation of the 130th.
rule of the House, which provides that 'all proceedings touch-
ing appiopnations of money shah first be discusbed in a Com-
mittee of the Whole House ' 5 Because it will compel the
Ilui^e to \ ote upon large appiopna' ions under the operation of
the previous question, which have never been examined or dis-
cussed in the Committee of the Whole , b Because, if the mo*
tion be put, the question is, Will the House concur in its own.
orders which is irregular and unparliamentary "
The CHAIR havu g overruled the point of Older,
Mi C11FFORD appealed fiom that decision, and observed
that he w shed to make the question apply to all the contin-
gencies
Mr  Til LMORE moved to lay the appeal on the table
Mr CAVE JOHNSON called for the yeas and nays, which
wereordeied,andresuItedinyeasS6,nays 75. So the appeal
was laid on the table.
The first question now pending was on concurring with th 
Committee of the Whole onlheeta'e of the Union id striking
out the following item

e northe 1st Executive budding,] including fuel, labor, oil,and
repairs, three thousand three hundred and fifty dollars "
Mr CARUTHJbRS asked the yeas and naye, which were or-
dered.
Some desultoiy conversation followed ag to matteisof fact;
mwhichMessia WARREN, \ H SHEPPERD, FiLLMOREf
EVERETT  and 3 R INGERSOLL participated
When Mr ANDREWS, of Kentucky, hoped the Speaker
would eniorce the operation of the previous question
The SPEAKER said all this conversation was out of order
Mr AN DREWS hoped, then, that the Speaker would insist
