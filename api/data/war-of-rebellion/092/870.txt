MACON, November 19, 1864.

Honorable James A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

There is great scarcity of arms in Georgia and South Carolina to meet the enemy. It is necessary to have additional arms to put into the hands of the levy en masse ordered by the Legislature of Georgia, and the reserve militia of South Carolina now called out by Governor Bonham. Please have all spare arms sent to Charleston, S. C., subject to my orders.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant - General.

MACON, November 19, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

I reached here this morning. The enemy on both sides Ocmulgee River, about thirty miles from Macon. A column is reported near Special Circle marching on Augusta. My opinion, hastily formed from the information before me, is that the enemy will ultimately form junction and march upon Augusta; General Cobb concurs. The force of the enemy consists of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Army Corps; and the infantry under General Cobb is around Macon.
