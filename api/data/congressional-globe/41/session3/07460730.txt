The CHAIRMAN. If there be no objec-
tion the first reading of the bill will be dis-
pensed with and the Clerk will proceed to read

There was no objection; and theClerkread

Be it enacted, d?câ€ž That the following sums be, and
they are hereby, appropriated, out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, forthe pur-
pose of paying the current and contingent expenses
of the Indian department and fulfilling so-called
treaty stipulations with the various Indian tribes:
For pay of eleven superintendents of Indian af-
fairs, namely: two superintendents for the tribes
east of the Rockv mountains; one for Oregon: one
for Washington Territory: one for the Territory of
New Mexico: one for the Territory of Utah ; one for
California: one for Nevada; onefor theTerritory of
Arizona; onefor Montana, and one for Idaho, $25,600.
Mr. SARGENT. I move to amend that
paragraph as follows:
After the words "New Mexico" strike out the
words "one for the Territory of Utah." Also strike
out the words "one for Nevada," and the Words
'one for Idaho."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SARGENT. I move now to strike
out " $2o,G00 " and to inseit in lieu thereof
" $19,100," and to explain these amendments
I submit the following letter from the Commis-
sioner of Indian Affairs :
Department of the Interior.
Office op Indian Affairs,
"Washington, D. Cm January 39,1871.
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 18th instant, relative to an
appropriation for a superintendent for Nevada.
In reply I have to say that the superintendences
of Nevada, Utah, and Idaho have been discontinued
by order of the President, the accents reporting:
directly to this office, and that consequently u will
not be necessary to make an appropriation for salary
of superintendents for said State and Territories.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant.
. H. Ii. CLUM,
Acting Comiiiisxioatr,
Hon. A. A. Sargent, House of Mepresentatives.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
For pay of sixty-two agents of Indian affair;!,
namely : three for the tribes in Oregon ; four for the
tribes in New Mexico; one additional for Indians
in New Mexico; one for the tribes in New Mexico;
one for the tribes in Utah; one additional lor the
Indians in Utah ; one for the tribes in the Territory
of Utah: eleven for the tribes east of tho Itocky
mountains; two for the tribes cast of the Rocky
mountains; six for the Indians east of the Itocky
mountains, ^namely: Sioux, Seminole, Omaha,
Kickapoo, Kansas, and Neosho agencies; three for
the tribes east ot the Rocky mountains; one for
the Indians in the State of New York; one for
Green Bfty, "Wisconsin ; three for the tribes in Wash-
ington Territory; one for the Wichitas and neigh-
boring tribes west of the Choctaws and Ohickasaws;
one for the tribes east of the Rocky mountains; one
for the Indians in the Territory of New Mexico; one
for the Foncatribe; one forthe Pawnees; one forthe
Yankton Sioux; three for the tribes in the Terntoiy
of Washington; one forthe Grand River and Uintah
bands of Indians in the Territory of Colorado ; two
for the Upper Missouri and the country adjacent
thereto; one for the Ottawas, Chippewas of Swan
Creek and Black River, and Christian Indians in
Kansas; three agents for the State of California; one
for the Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche Indians; one
forthe Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of Dakota or
Sioux Indians; one for the bands of Sacs and Foxes
of the Mississippi, now in Tnma county, Iowa; one
for the Indians in the State of Nevada ; one for the
Crow tribe of Indians; one for the Shoshonps and
Bannocks; and one lor the Sioux Indians of Devil's
Lake, #93,600: Provided, That it shall be the duty of
the President to dispense with the services of such
Indian agents andsuperintendents herein mentioned
as may be practicable : and where it is practicable,
he shall require the same person to perform the
duties of two agencies or superintendencies for one
salary.
Mr.,FITCH. I move, in lines forty and
forty-one, in page 3 of the bill, to strike out
the words, "one for the Indians in the State
of Nevada;" and in lines forty-three and
forty-four to strike out "$93,600" and to
insert in lieu thereof " $02,100."
Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment for
the reason that in mj judgment it is in no wise
necessary that there should be an Indian agent
in the State of Nevada, and I shall follow it
up by an amendment to strike out the appro-
priation for interpreters and agents wherever
they occur, as well as the general appropria-
tion of $15,000 reported by the committee in
the latter part of the bill. I desire to say here
generally that all the money that is expended
in the State of Nevada for the purpose of pay-
ing salaries of Indian agents and purchasing
blankets for Indians is uselessly expended.
But a small portion of the Indians reside on
the reservations or go to the point of distri-
bution to procure blankets, and when they do,
they often trade or gamble the blankets off on
the spot for something that will not benefit
them so much as blankets. Generally the
goods distributed find their way speedily to the
stores of persons supposed to be in harmony
with the Indian agents. The money is wasted;
its expenditure is of no benefit to the Govern-
ment or to the Indians. I therefore offer this
amendment.
Mr. SARGENT. Mr. Chairman, the gen-
tleman from Nevada, I suppose, gave the House
the key-note of his sentiments upon this sub-
ject in the remark which he made upon this
floor, that a good Indian was a dead Indian.
For all such philosophy I have no sympa-
thy^ lean point the gentleman to instances
in his own State not many years ago, where,
when the Indian tribes rose and were carrying
death and destruction to all the frontier settle-
