WYANDOTTE, October 14, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD:

I cannot spare Major Pritchard from his post. He must understand it and defend the city with his two companies and the militia.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 14, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Kansas City:

Do you think it best to order the large steam ferry-boat at Atchison down to this place as security any attempt of the enemy north of Missouri River to cross at that point?

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,In the Field, near Wyandotte, October 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Fort Leavenworth:

Leave the ferry-boat at Atchison. The people there have too much sense to let bushwhackers get it. I have given them ample caution. Marmaduke will hurry back to help Price out of the State. If this idea is incorrect further arrangements may be necessary. My troops are closing up and my advance is again at Independence and Pleasant Hill. My scouts to-day went within fifteen miles of Lexington, the scattering drawing back. Colonel Ford reports 3 rebels killed; our loss nothing.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 14, 1864.

Major HILLIARD,

Weston:

I would advise keeping scouts out to the east-well out, to watch any approach of Marmaduke or Shelby in this direction. Answer what you do, and if anything in this line.

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
