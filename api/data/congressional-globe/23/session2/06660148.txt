148                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._____________January 21,
Mr PATTON then rose and said, Mr Speaker,
as a member of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, and as a reference has been made to me, I
feel it my duty to say a few words on the subject
brought before us—brought before us, sir, with
out any participation of mine, but of which I take
leave in the outset to say I do not complain I
was in the minority of the committee on the*elec-
tion of chairman, and voted against the dismis-
sion and displacement of the nonorabie and dis-
tinguished member from Massachusetts, from that
position which, by usage, he occupied, and which
I saw, and can now see, no just or proper reason
why he should be removed therefrom And,
sir, I feel myself especially called upon to make
this statement, because of the remarks made
by the gentleman fiom New York, that considera-
* tions oí delicacy and propriety demanded of the
honorable member [Mr Everftt] that he should
have íettred from that situation, which reflects
as much upon my course in voting that he should
retain his position as it does upon that gentle
man
Mr CAMBRELENG disclaimed all intention
of applying his remark to the gentleman from
Virginia, or to the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mi Everftt ] He had referred to the former
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
[Mr Archer,] and to him alone
Mr PATTON I understood the gentleman
to say that the honoiable member fiom Massa-
chusetts should have retired from the situation
in which he stood, and in which, m my humble
judgment, he had a right to stand, fiom considera-
tions of delicacy and propriety Sir, my vote I
was given in ordei to retain him in a position I
which constituted a situation of delicacy and pro-
priety, a d I maintain that he had no just or proper
grounds for retiring fiom it, that it was an ele-
vated, an honorable, a distinguished situation to
which he had arrived in due course, and that it
devolved upon him high and important duties,
which he would have been recreant if he had
shrunk from the peiformance of That gentleman
had long been a distinguished ornament of that
committee, he was about to retire from the posi-
tion he had so honorabjy and ably sustained, he
was about to retire from Congress, and it seemed
to me to be an uncalled for, an unjust, and there-
fore an improper act, calculated to mortify his
feelings, that he should be thus displaced from
the position he had held
£ readily admit that, under oidmary circum-
stances, and at the commencement of the session,
a gentleman should be placed at the head of that
committeefnendly to the existing Admimstiution,
a committee, before which there was likely to
come on questions of deep and vital importance,
but that time had passed, the whole mattei con-
nected with the subject of our foreign lelations of
the slightest interest or importance to the country
or the House, had long been before that commit-
tee, had been deliberated upon by that committee,
and its solemn judgment given in relation to the
most prominent and important question involved
in our deliberations
Sir, I again reiterate the statement made by the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mi Everett,]
that, as I understood the complexion of the opm
ion of the committee, there is and was a majority
concurring in the views which I understand that
honorable member to maintain m íelation to that
subject, from anything that he has offered in the
shape of action in committee, but by his concur-
rence in the action 1 had myself .proposed, and
against which there has not yet been any decisive
vote, and upon which tneie has been an expres-
sion of opinion as to its propriety fi urn a majority
of'the committee I ask, then, why it is, and
upon what principle of delicacy and propriety it'
is, that the honorable gentleman was called upon
to abandon that position, in order to place upon
that committee a gentleman understood until now
to be in the minority of the committee' It is
news to me, to use the language employed by an
honoiable member from Maine upon that com-
mittee, [Mr Jarvis,] " it is news to me," which
has just been announced by the honorable mem-
ber from New Y one—¡but most agreeable and
acceptable news to me, that there is no mernbei I
of that committee in favoi of recommending repa-
sáis at present1 I rejoice to hear it I trust it
may be proclaimed throughout the lard I am
glad to find there has undergone a change of opin '
ion, with a portion of the committee, for certain
it is that the time was that there was a consider- '
able minority of that committee, which had grown,
and which I confess I began to fear would grow
so large, as to make the majority, in favor of an
immediate and prompt lecommendatiort of repri-
sals, in conformity with the recommendation of
the President of the United States Sir, I am
glad, I am delighted to hear that such is the Etate
of things, and ! do trust that a majority of this
House will projmptly second and confirm this now
unanimous judgment of the committee, that that
recommendation shall not be carried out Trust-
ing that this feeling, so much to be rejoiced at—
that this unanimity, so much to be desired, may
be found to prevail elsewhere, as well as in the
committee, I shall, sn, if I can get permission of
the House, upon the first opportunity, present a
proposition that will enable the House to indicate
that feeling
There has been, and is now, a question before
the committee, presented for action by myself—
presented substantially three weeks ago, which
was once rejected, and ls-now postponed—post-
poned—I know not with what view—to what end
—with what design But I wish the House and
the country to understand that the delay which
has taken place, and the failure to act upon this
important subject, about which the country is so
much alive, and so anxious—one in which the
country is so deeply inteiested—one in relation to
which we have various and perpetual calls to know
what we aiegomgto do, and why we do not act—
I wish the House and the countiy to understand
that it is a delay in which I have had no participa-
tion There is no man upon that committee, no
matter of what political party—and I say it injus-
tice to those honorable'gentlemen of that commit-
tee who belong to what is called the Opposition
party—no man disposed to pass censure upon the
Admimsttation, but on the contraiy, all are dis-
posed to respond to the geneial tone of the Presi-
dent's message, as prompted by a patriotic spirit,
and a jealous regard foi the rights of the country
It is one to which the voices of the representa
Uves of the people of the United States ought to
respond, and, at the same time, avoid doing any-
thing calculated to prevent the satisfactoi y adjust- i
ment of a matter involving the interests ot the
countiy There ought to be a repo-t made at
once, so as to prevent the recunence of any new
difficulty
As to this appointment of a chairman, I feel ro
concern about it whatever. Individually, it is to
me, as I should think it must be to everybody
else, a matter of not the slightest concein who is
at the head of the committee—except as to per
sonal feeling, for any other purpose it is, indeed,
a quanel about nothing But.sn, I am perfectly
willing that the House shall decide, in some way
that shall be final, what aie the rights of the com-
mittee in relation to this subject, and whether the
appointment by the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions be an authoritative and valid appointment
If it be, sir, I am content, and care nothing about
it, let it stand If it be not, then, sir, I hope the
House will take it into their own hands, and elect
their own chairman, and whenever such a ques
tion is presented tome—having not seen—-not now
seeing—any ieason why a prefeience should be
drawn against the honorable gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mi Everett,] he shall have my vote
here most cordially, as he had it there
Mr CAMBRELENG extremely regretted that
he was compelled to rise again in a debate of this
character, but the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
Patton,] in repelling a  presumed  attack,  had
charged a majority of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs with neglecting their duty to the House. I
When the proper time ainves for decisive action,
he trusted that the committee would not be back
ward in discharging its duty to the House, and its
obligations toihe country     He did not know that
there was any member of the committee in favor I
of proposing reprisals, or any other measure, at
this time—that there was a majority of the Cora- I
inittee, and he was authorized to state it—indeed i
the proceedings of no committee could be with- I
held from, the House—who were of opinion that
if we meant to do nothing, it was best to say
nothing Some of the members of the co-nmittee
—and he was one of that number—believed tnat
to be the most d gmfied couise lie thought it
not entirely compatible with the interest or honor
of the country, in the |iresent attitude of oui rela-
tions with France, to propose to the House a reso-
lution even of a negative or declaratory character
He was opposed, in the peculiar state of our rela-
tions, to taking any step which might be miscon-
btrued to imply a disposition on the part of the
House to do homage to " the pride of France "
Other gentlemen opposed immediate action on
other grounds The gentleman who nioved the
postponement of a resolution—similar to that
adopted by the Senate, and offered by the gentle-
man from Virginia fMr Pattok]—made the mo-
tion, believing that the most effectual way of doing
nothing, was to say nothing A majority of the
committee were decidedly opposed to any action
whatever at this time, but if the House thought
otherwise, the committee could b" instructed to
report such a resolution as the gentlemen from
Virginia and Massachusetts desned
Mr PATTON said either the gentleman from
New Yoik was very unfortunate in heanng, or I
was very unfortunate in giving expressions to
my thoughts, if he understood me as making any
attack upon the majority of the committee, or
as intending to reflect upon them 1 have rather
too much of self respect, even if I had not what
I hope I have, a pioper share of respect for this
House, and for all us oigans, to express what
I certainly d.d not feel, any disrespect to any
one of them But the committees of this House
are agents of this House, and undei its control,
and in the House, when the proper occasion shall
arrive, I will say exactly when, and in what, and
how far I differ in opinion with the majority of
the committee I disagree to the conectness,and
policy, and wisdom cf the course pursued bythat
majority, and I have indicated as much there 1
deny the right of that committee to prevent the
House from expressing its opinion upon matters
which are matured for us judgment, because the
committee do not choose to express theirs We
are now nearly at the close of the second month of
this short session of three months, and this matter
has been before us, befoie the House, and before
the whole country, for upwards of six weeks, and
will any man upon that committee, or in the
House, say thit he has not formed his judgment
upon these matters'
Mr BOON here rose to a question of order, and
after some conversation thereon by the CHAIR,
Messrs BOON, J Q. ADAMS, POLK, and
BR1GGS,
Mr PATTON proceeded He was aware that
his remarks were not strictly relevant to the mo-
tion before the House, but the remaiks made by
the honorable chairman of the Committee on Fo,(
eign Relations had drawn him into a widei range
than he had intended He had merely to add, that
he conceived as soon as a committee had formed
an opinion upon a subject matter before it, it >vas
its duty to present it to the House
Mr COULTER said, in his opinion, the motion
of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Ad
ams] was strictly parliamentary, and called for
by the condition of the Committee on Foieign
Affairs It was very true that in some old books
upon par''amentary law, it was stated, that al-
though by usage and courtesy the fiist named on
the committee was the chairman of thatcommittee,
yet it was nevertheless in the power of that com-
mittee to constitute its own chairman, but Mr C
knew of no instance in which this practice had
been observed Fie thought, also, that in case of
resignation of thefirst named individual, the second
on the list of the committee became chairman, that
lule being equivalent to, and commensurate with,
the other lheiefore it was that when a com-
mittee was announced, at the commencement or
at any other period of the session, it was well
known to the House and to the country who was
the chairman of the same But if the committee
undertook to exercise the power which this old
rule seemed to confer upon them, it must became
necessary so to inform the House, so that it might
be entered on the Journals, and become generally
