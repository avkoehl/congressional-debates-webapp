informs me that it would have been made sooner if he had known that action on his part was waited for. He had previously written to you, but I infer, from the fact that you did not mention his letter, that it had failed to reach you. You have probably noticed that the order issued from the Adjutant-General's Office for the organization of colored troops looks only to the acceptance of volunteers, and, in a letter received this evening from General Lee he expresses the opinion that there should be compulsory enlistment in the first instance. My idea has been that we should draw into our military service that portion of the negroes which would be most apt to run away and join the army of the enemy, and that this would be best effected by seeking volunteers for our own army. If this plan should fail to obtain the requisite number there will still remain the process of compulsory enlistment.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The transportation of such of Pickett's troops as have gone over is all on this side. Would it not be well to bring them back to near Wilton bridge, and camp them where they will be convenient to both sides?

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Northern Virginia:

General Gary reports the enemy tearing up the blockade at White Oak Swamp bridge; force unknown. Fitz Lee reports that one brigade of cavalry and one of infantry left the White House yesterday at noon and marched to the Forge Bridge, where they camped last night. They had eleven wagons, three of them loaded with pontoons or lumber to build a bridge. Officers of the enemy told citizens that Sheridan would be along to-day. There were large camp-fires at Taylorsville last night-probably a portion of Sheridan's force. Rosser will be at Mechanicsville to-night.

J. LONGSTREET,

General R. E. LEE, Petersburg:

Some of our scouts report the passage of troops across the enemy's bridge this morning about sunrise, but could not determine whether the troops were coming to this side or going to the other. Have you any information about the matter?

J. LONGSTREET,Lieutenant-General.
