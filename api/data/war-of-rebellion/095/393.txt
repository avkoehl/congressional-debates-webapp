Lieutenant Ladd commanding, and reached the Blackwater, at South Quay, at about 9 a.m. From all the information I could obtain from the citizens I was satisfied that the enemy were advance aware of our movement and on Saturday night had sent for re-enforcement, expecting a raid from Bower's Hill. I met a family of refugees near the Blackwater, who came down from Weddon, and questioned them separately and ascertained that two companies of infantry were about a mile back, on the Murfree's Depot road; also, one company of cavalry. I dismounted three companies, ordered them to move cautiously to the ferry, and seize the boat, but found the boat had been secured on the opposite side. I shelled the opposite shore vigorously, which had a tendency to cause the enemy to develop his strength, and deeming it imprudent to attempt a crossing with my small force, I returned at 10 o'clock last night; no casualties.

I captured as the ferry 3 bales of cotton, 3 horses, and 1 cart.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. F. DERN,

Captain, Commanding Detachment Third New York Cavalry .
