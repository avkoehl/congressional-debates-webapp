JEFFERSON CITY, October 17, 1864-7.15 p.m.

Brigadier-General EWING, Saint Louis:

If you have any force to spare send it to Forbes or Douglass, not to Kansas. We want to destroy Majors, who is reported to have 1,500 men. Communicate with Forbes or Douglass and let him know what you can do for him.

By order of General Rosecrans:

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, MO., October 17, 1864.

Major F. S. BOND:

I was led to recommend sending two regiments to General Curtis by the information had from Colonel Lynde, Ninth Kansas, who has just come from there, and reports Curtis as having but 2,000 cavalry volunteers and 1,000 cavalry militia and 6,000 infantry militia. I know little about General Douglass, but venture to suggest that Lieutenant-Colonel Hequembourg, Fortieth Missouri Volunteers, would manage the troops at Mexico more effectually than he.

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, October 17, 1864.

Major FRANK S. BOND, Jefferson City:

I now order the 800 men sent by me to patrol the road from Saint Charles to Macon to report to Brigadier-General Douglass. They have been practically under his control since Sunday morning. He telegraphs me that he cannot drive the rebels out with infantry and wants cavalry, of which I have none to send, and also wants two pieces of artillery. Shall I send them? I do not see much use in sending any more infantry, as General Douglass says he is powerless with a force of infantry as large as the force Majors is reported to have. Shall I send more infantry also?

THOS. EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 17, 1864-11.45 p.m.

Brigadier-General EWING, Saint Louis:

The general commanding directs that you send Colonel Rogers or Colonel Samuel A. Holmes, with all the troops you can spare, to operate upon the enemy from the most available point, say Allen. Give them orders to pursue the enemy until he is destroyed. They will subsist off rebels, giving receipts and protect all other private property and obey the orders of General Fisk when he reaches there. Colonel Lynde must be mistaken as to Curtis' cavalry force; the Second Colorado alone has nearly 1,000. General Douglass has orders to furnish all assistance and attend to the supplies and communications, but not to command.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
