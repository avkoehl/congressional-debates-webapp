tary to read the report.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
The Committee on Pensions, to whom was referred
the petition of A. J. Gray for a pension, beg leave to
report that-A. J. Sray was appointed a pilot of tho-
Mississippi squadron on the 21st day of December,
1802; he served for a short time on the steamer Louis-
ville, and'then was, by order of Admiral Porter, de-
tailed to serve on the Judge Torrence, on which he
served until the 13th of February, 1863. He was hon-
orably discharged on account ot disease contracted
in the service of the country. His disease, according
to the certificates of two surgeons, one a Govern-
ment officcr, was caused by concussion resulting in a
settled nervous disease which has caused partial pa-
ralysis of the nerves of locomotion, rendering him a'
cripple for life, and also impairing his sense of hear-
ing. His injuries ha ve rendered him unable to makÂ®
a support for himself and family, and the committee
think the facts in this case fully justify the bill here-
with roported.

amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, was read the third time, and passed.
