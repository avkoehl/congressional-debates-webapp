LOUISVILLE, November 30, 1863.

Captain W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Mr. Hoffman, of this place, showed me a dispatch purporting to come from W. S. Thomas, Toronto, dated to-day, saying that John H. Morgan had arrived there. I don't believe it, and have given notice to commanders to send scouts out on every road and overhaul every stranger. Believe it is intended to deceive.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, KY., November 30, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Louisville:

Have ordered scouts on all roads. Two hundred men are now on Cumberland River.

Have sent instructions to look out for Morgan.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

LOUISVILLE, November 30, 1863. (Received 7.30 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have not gotten Governor Bramlette's consent-will see him day after to-morrow. I ordered negroes in mean time to be employed as teamsters, which was done. I propose to get consent of the owners to enlist them. Does your restriction "shall be loyal" exclude quiet, law-abiding men, whose feelings and sympathies are with South and Southern institutions? In Judge Ballard's court it is made to apply only to those guilty of some act. Will write fully from Camp Nelson.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

PADUCAH, November 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

The troops ordered from Eastport to Nashville not passed here. When they get here I will send them to Columbus, Ky., as you direct.

Very respectfully,

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding.

PADUCAH, November 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

There have been no dispatches received here indicating a return from Eastport of the troops that have gone up Tennessee River.
