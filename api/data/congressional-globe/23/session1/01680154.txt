BANK—PENSION AGENCY.
The SPEAKER presented a message from the
Piesident of the United &ates, íelauve to the
refusal of the United States Bank to deliver up the
books, papers, or funds, belonging to the pension
agency, togethei with the correspondence between
the Secretary of Wai and ihe President of the
bank, with the opinion of the Attorney General
(The message will be found in the Senate pi o
ceedmgs J
Mr HUBBARD moved that the message and
accompanying documents be punted, and referred
to the Committee of Ways and Means
Mr WILLIAMS made a motion, which he
nftei wards withdrew, to read the opinion of the
Attorney Geneial
Mr WAfMOUGHti usted thatno such course
as the lefeienc'e to the Committee of Wayis and
Means would be taken on the documents then p^e
sented They were of importance equivalent to
any which had come before the House d unrig the
seosion They mark a new set of principles on
which the conduct oí the executive government is
made to depend They assail an institution whos 
ofRceis have been appointed by law, without ie-
gard to the exiting laws of the land Tne Cpm
mittee of Ways and Means have got a voracious
appetite, and seem decirous to devour all that
comes befoie the House This is a question of
liw, and should be decided by a committee, on
iaw He therefoie moved that the message, wi h
the documents, be refened to thejudiciaiy Com
mittee
Mr ALLAN moved the postponement of the
subject till to-moirow.
Ine SPEAKER having put this question, then 
•ppeai ed
Ayes So, and noes 1]3, on it
Mr   HUBBARD considered  the sibject be-
longed piopeily to the Committee of Wayb and
Means,as it is but auxihaiyto the mam question,
«Jready íefuied, in conjunction with various pen
tions, memoituia, and document , on  the  bank
topic, to that committee     It is nota question of
law, but of (act     It is a question to (¡ende con
ceirung the moneys appropriated for a particular
purpose—whether the ¿ecietaiy of War has seen
that the pension agency is pi ipeily discharged,
and the appropniuons piopeily disbuised     It is
a topic of tacts relative to the funds, the juristic
lion of whn h belongs expressly to the Commit ee
of Ways and Means
Mr BARRINGCR thinks thatth  collision has
arisen concerning the construction of the law, and
therefoie that the topic belongs to the Judiouiy
Committee, as the expounders of a law m contest
ation lie desned that the communication of the
President of the United States Bank be read
(This was accordingly done, and, on the re-
quest of members, the letter of the Seuetary of
War and the opinion of the Attorney Geneial
weie also read ]
Mr B said that the question wasnotonerelatm 
to the finances of the country, to which the juris-
diction of the Committee of Waj s and Means was
limited
An anpropnation for the pension fund had been
made by Congress, and placed in the custody of
the bank, bey md the contiol of the Executive,
furthei than to specify the drafts in each instance
ior those pur posts toi which the appropriation had
been given The bank was appointed the agent
to pay the pensions to the men enUtled by law to
receive it, and it was peimittedto pay it m its own
local currency. The agency had been entrusted
to the bank bylaw, and that agency it cannot sur-
render but by law It is necessary, therefore, to
examine the legal bearings of the subject This
belongs to that committee which had assigned to
it a peculiar fitness for peculiar purposes This
committee was that on the judiciary Tnero did
not aprear to be any othei difficulty than what
arose out of the construction to be given to a par-
ticular statute, and he could not hold that any
difference of this kind should constitute an offence
of such a grave character that it was necessary to
punish the bank by sending the subject to the
Committee of Ways and Means instead of to the
appropriate committee—the Copimiit<.e on the Ju-
diciary. He complained that the Executive had
denounced the bank for having only done that
which they had aright to do, believing tnat they
weie the agents appointed by law foi the payment
of these pensioners, and he felt warranted, from
the tone throughout the message, in believing tha ,
if the President had the power he would have
used it to coeice the bank for so doing He re-
quested honorable members to consider for what
object was the message sent to Congress Was it
not that legislation might be had on the subject?
That they might take such steps as v/eie neces-
sary to be taken by them as would bring the
controversy to an end, without causing any fur-
ther trouole' This being, in his opinion, the
President's object, the stilject for their determina-
tion then was, to what committee should it be
' sent5   He asked honoiable members to say, if m
all cases where a difference arose on points of law,
it w is not the practice of the House to refei such
matteis to theC immitteeon the Judiciary, which,
as thejudicial oigan of the House, was considered
the  appiopiiate o ie '    But it would seem that it |
was,  netessaiy to serd this to the Committee of ]
Ways and   Weans      Why was it necessaiy that
tnat committee should be disposed to grasp at and 1
to h ive ail  the subjec s to lie   presented   to the
House ot i npoitan-e under its control>  lie could
not asseit to ouch a disposition of this message,
and  vas pioceeJing to discuss some topics con-
nected   with   the   geneial   bank   subject,   upon

1 always been ent^lieie' That this was the case
v.as as well known to the ¿reptan in who made
the in enngdtoiy as it «as to every othei meml er
in the Hou e Weie not all the other memorials '
in relation to die bank committed to that commit- i
tee Had rot tne gentleman h mself 'eneatedlj ,
by former votes g ven by him,contnbuted as much
as any one could to cause such a direction to be
g-uen to such suljects?    Why, then, were'hey to |
| be called on by him, whom he challenged 'o give
' a single instance in which th s practice was de-
parted from, to ¡enounce it' He was unAilling
to go into motives, but if he were inclined to do
so, as lie might be justified from the imputation
that was endeavoied to be cast upon the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, was he not entitled to
put this intei rogatory wi'h more justice, and cer-
tainly with more difficulty to answer Will the
bank have the 'impudence, as has been said else-
where, to make the attempt to dictate to Con-
gress at the expense of pensioners who may be
starving'
The fePEAKER here reminded the gentleman
of the necessity of confining his remarks to the
question to which of the committees the message
should be sent
Mr CLAY continued and said, that although
he had as much confidence m the integrity, intel-
ligence, and capacity of the members composing
the Commit ee on the Judiciary, and thought that
they could do as full justice to the subject as any
other committee, yet it was not advisable to send
this qj stion there, the effect of winch must be to
make this a sepaiate question from others m rela-
tion to the bank which had been sent to the Com
mittee of Ways and Meins He could not con-
ceive any possible necessity existed to justify this
bein  divided from the others sent to that commit-
tee He considered that th s was ur qoes lonably
nithin°" less tnan tantamount to the question em-
biaced in the question of the removal of the
deposites What did the pension law of 1832
enact > Was it not attempted to be violated by
the bank?
The SPEAKER here reminded the gentleman
of the necessity of confining his remanís to the
question to which of the committees the message
should be sent.
Mr CLAY hoped it was not necessary to ad-
monish him, as he knew not when he could be
rightfully chaiged with departing from the rules of
debate
The SPEAKER reminded him, that he had pre-
vented the member who preceded him from going
into the general d'scussion, and that he must do
so to every other member
Mr C exniessed his wi'lmgness to submit to
the decision of the Chair, and proceeded to argue
that, inasmuch as all bills making appropriations
of the public money emanated from tne Committee
of Ways and Means, the money to pay these pen-
s ors wa3 appropriated, and the bill doing this had
o-iginated in thatcomn lttee It should, therefore,
be now deemed the most appiopnate committee to
dispose of the matter at issue between the bank
and the Government He referred to, and quoted,
trie 57th rule of the House.which showed that upon
tnat committee was enjoined the duty of taking
into consideration all the reports from the Treas-
ury Department, into which they were to examine,
repoit thereon, examine into the state of the pub-
lic departments, and particularly into the laws
tnemselves making such appiopmtions After a
few remarks m explanation between Mr Barrin-
ger and himself, Mr C expressed his hope that
the subject would be sent to the Committee of
Ways and Means
Mr CHILTON humorously remarked, that the
anxiety of his fuerd, the member from AJabama,
[Mr Ciay,] to discuss the geneial subject con-
nected wita the bank, as was evinced by hisseveial
at'empts to do so duung the present debate, and
wh ch, ir his mind, had nothing to do with it,
re mnded him of the story told of a truant school-
boy, wno, when questioned by his mastei," how
«"happened that he was generally late or absent
from sol ool," gave for excuse, " that the giound
was so slippery with ice, that for every step he
went foiward, he went twob ickwards " " Well,
then," rejoined the master, " how do you account
for coming here at a'l?" The boy logically ac-
counted for it by stating " that he was only enaoled
to do so by starting offm an opposite direction,"
and the boj 's practice was followed out by the
member from Alabama, to effect his pm pose in the
present discussion Mr. C advocated the propri-
ety of sending the message to the Committee on the
Judiciary in preference to the Committee of Ways
and Means It appeared that the Executive, be-
fore sending it to the House, had laid it before his
j ldicial officer, the Attorney Geneial, as he felt
there was a difficulty in the way He considered
thft a judicial 'tribunal was the first to be re-
sulted to, a id was competent solely to pronounce
upon it Why, then, he would ask, should they
hesitate to follow this example, and for what ob-
ject'
A reason had been given the other day by tha
honorable mover of the refetence to the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, upon some matter be-
foie the House, " that it was an imputation to with-
hold " If this was a good reason for that honor-
able member to urge, might he not retort now, and
say that, as it was usual to refer such a subject as
this message to the Judiciary Committee, it would
be an i mjiutation upon tnat committee not todo so,
as it was their usual practice in such cases' He
entreated,if theie was anything like order or con-
sistency in their rules to be observed, that this
would be done, and that the House would not be
induced, by any political or other ccns'derations,
to give the suoject any other than the d rection
they ought to give it If it was in order for him
to go into muendoes, he might say, we have seen
a rising storm-------
The SPEAKER here called to order.
