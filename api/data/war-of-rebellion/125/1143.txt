by the acting assistant provost-marshal-general of this State, the proportion of men enlisted for three years entitled the State to a surplus credit on the call of July of 20,719 one-year's men to be credited to the present call.

On the 31st of December this department was officially notified that the quotas of the several Congressional districts of Michigan, under the call of December 19, 1864, after deducting credits, were as follows:

First District......................................... 449

Second District........................................ 1,404

Third District......................................... 1,794

Fourth District........................................ 459

Fifth District.........................................

Sixth District......................................... 1,716

-----

Total.................................................. 5,822

On the 4th of February, however, a further notification was received from the acting assistant provost-marshal-general of the State, which placed the entire quota of the State of Michigan under the call of December, at 30,745 men, or 30,745 years of service, which, after deducting the credits to which they were entitled, placed the quota of the several Congressional district as follows:

First District......................................... 1,726

Second District........................................ 1,801

Third District......................................... 1,918

Fourth District........................................ 1,263

Fifth District......................................... 1,329

Sixth District......................................... 1,986

-----

Total, after deducting credits.........................10,026

A quota for Michigan of over 30,000 on a total call of 300,000, being more than one-tenth of the whole, it is apparent at a glance, involves an enormous error in calculation. The unquestioned fact that there was a surplus in Michigan under the call of July entirely excludes the State from any computations based upon the deficiencies under that call, and limits its liability, subject to the modifications produced by allowing the credits promised for long terms of service, to the requirements of the demand for 300,000 men. It is submitted that justice requires that a new and largely reduced quota shall be assigned to this State.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. ROBERTSON,

Adjutant-General of Michigan.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 6, 1865.

Major-General POPE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The Secretary of War authorizes you to take the two regiments of enlisted rebel deserters at Rock Island and to appoint, provisionally, their officers, sending their names to the Adjutant-General for approval and commissions, with dates of your appointments. Colonel Caraher (I think this is the name), at Rock Island, who selected these men, is highly recommended for the command of one of the regiments. The officers appointed must be in the service now, or have been honorably discharged. So far as can be done, they should be men familiar with frontier life.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
