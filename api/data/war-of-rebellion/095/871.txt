miles. On the 30th a reconnaissance was made by this command in front of the position occupied by the Third Division, the skirmishers advancing two miles and a half toward the Dabney house, on the White Oak road. Here the brigade bivouacked for the night after marching a distance of five miles. At 11 a. m. the 31st ultimo, the brigade being formed in line of battle, advanced and attacked the enemy in his entrenched position upon the White Oak road. After a gallant and most determined effort to carry the enemy's lines it was repulsed, with heavy loss, and compelled to fall back. The line, however, being reformed, subsequently advanced with the rest of the corps and occupied the enemy's position.

For the details of this day's operations I have the honor to refer you to my report of the 13th [12th] instant,* from which it will appear that the regiments of the brigade on this occasion distinguished themselves by their valor and discipline under circumstances peculiarly trying.

April 1, the command having moved from camp at midnight, marched by the Boydton plank road toward Dinwiddie Court-House until 6 a. m., when, forming in line of battle, it rested until 2 p. m., at a point two miles north of the Court-House. The division was then ordered to support the cavalry, who were at this time engaged about two miles in advance. On reaching the field the division engaged the enemy, this brigade forming the left of the line of battle. The enemy's works were carried. One thousand prisoners and four stand of colors formed the share of the fruits of this victory rightfully claimed by this command alone. Bvt. Brigadier General Fred. Winthrop fell mortally wounded while gallantly leading the brigade on this occasion, and was succeeded by Colonel James Grindlay, One hundred and forty-sixth New York Volunteers.
