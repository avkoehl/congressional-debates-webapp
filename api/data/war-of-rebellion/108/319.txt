nothing. If you cannot act, please forward it to him." No such letter has reached me. Your dispatch to General Loring I have forwarded by special courier. I send yesterday three days' provisions for the four regiments of the brigade on Sewell, and gave directions that the troops sent yesterday should take the same quantity with them. It was reporte to me that this order had been executed. I shall start immediately additional provisions for the troops, and shall use every possible effort to keep them suplied. The country hereabouts is this morning inundated by the subsistence for stock; still, every human effort shall be made in this direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

John B. FLOYD.
