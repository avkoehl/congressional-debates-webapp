in bridging it. Colonel Suman, Ninth Indiana, and Major Watson, Seventy-fifth Illinois, using the pioneers of the corps as laborers and mechanics, built a substantial trestle bridge, 309 feet long, over which the corps, with its artillery and wagons, safely passed. Elk River was crossed on the 3rd of January, and on the 5th the corps was encamped in the vicinity of this place.

Thus was closed for the Fourth Corps one of the most remarkable campaigns of the war. The enemy, superior in numbers, had been driven by assault, in utter rout and demoralization, from strongly entrenched position, pursued more than 100 miles, and forced to recross the Tennessee River. By actual capture on the field of battle and by abandonment in his flight the enemy had lost three-quarters of his artillery; in prisoners taken from him, be desertion, in killed and wounded, his force had certainly been diminished 15,000; and his loss in small-arms, ammunition, and other material of war enormous. From an organized army, beleaguering the capital of Tennessee, the foe had been beaten into a disorganized mass-a mere rabble. The Fourth Corps captured 25 pieces of artillery, 4 stand of colors, and of small-arms a large number, of which, however, no account could be taken, as the pursuit was commenced early the morning of the 17th. Of the artillery captured 19 pieces were taken by assault on the enemy's works. The corps captured 111 commissioned officers and 1,857 non-commissioned officers and privates.

The casualties of the corps amounted to-Officers, killed, 19; wounded, 55. Non-commissioned officers and privates, killed, 114; wounded, 759.*

For the more minute details of the movements of the troops on the field of battle and in the pursuit, I most respectfully refer the commanding general to the reports of the division, brigade, and regimental commanders; and for the special mention of numerous acts of gallantry and good conduct, I must also refer him to their reports.

I desire to commend to the consideration of the commanding general the skill and intelligence evinced by the division commanders-Brigadier-Generals Kimball, Elliott, and Beatty-in the handling of their commands, and for the personal gallantry displayed by them on the field of battle. Their services entitle them to the gratitude of the nation and to the most kindly consideration of the Government. The division commanders mention the services of their brigade commanders in terms of the highest praise; they also commend their staff officers for good conduct and valuable services. The reports of the brigade commanders attest the meritorious conduct of the regimental commander and of the brigade staff officers.

From the very best opportunity of observing, I can truly bear testimony, and I do it with the highest satisfaction, to the soldierly, in truth, splendid conduct of the whole corps in all the conflicts of the 15th and 16th. I have never seen troops behave better on any battle-field.

To the members of my staff-Lieutenant-Colonel Fullerton, assistant adjutant-general and chief of staff; Lieutenant-Colonel Greenwood, assistant inspector-general; Major Sinclair, assistant adjutant-general; Major Dawson, Fifteenth Ohio Volunteers, chief of outposts and pickets; First Lieutenant George Shaffer, Ninety-third Ohio, and First Lieutenant C. D. Hammer, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio, aides-de-camp; Captain Stansbury, Nineteenth Regulars, assistant commissary of musters; Captain Henry Kaldenbaugh, provost-marshal; and Lieutenant Kennedy, acting assistant inspector-I owe many thanks for the
