this subject. Georgia is stripped of arms. Men in abundance, if a few days are allowed.

A. R. LAWTON,

Brigadier-General.

ATLANTA, GA., September 25, 1861.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Stovall, whose battalion is at Lynchburg, is here. Cannot send another gun out of the State. I ask that your order his battalion back to Brunswick on the coast, and I will fill it up to a regiment in the State. I also request that five other armed companies of Georgia troops be ordered back to the coast without delay, as an invasion of the coast is looked for daily, and you have nearly all the State guns in the Confederate service. Please answer both requests immediately. Colonel Stovall will wait here till I hear from you.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

RICHMOND, September 25, 1861

Governor BROWN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Have sent orders to Major Shackleford, as requested. Have ordered Bartow Artillery Company to Savannah to report to General Lawton. Am reliably informed that the enemy will attack Brunswick. Be prepared.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

ATLANTA, GA., September 26, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

Thank you for the order for the 1,000 guns to General Lawton. Let me beg of you to order Colonel Stovall's battalion back from Lynchburg and let me fill it up to regiment for the coast.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

RICHMOND, September 26, 1861

Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Your dispatch received. I cannot order back to Georgia any armed troops for reasons which I will explain by letter. Instead of sending you a thousand men, I have ordered 1,000 of the rifles at Savannah, with the proper quantity of ammunition, to be turned over to General Lawton for arming that number of your men, as I understand you have plenty of men.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.
