APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
28th Cong.. ..1st Sess.
the great anxieties of the manufacturers here in get-
ting high duties imposed on cheap cotton goods, into
consideration, together with what Mr. Sarchet de-
clares to be the foreign prices, we have the best
reason^ for assuming that we are forced to pay for
that description of goods a great deal more now, than
we should be required to pay were the duty re-
duced to a fair revenue standard, so as to invite
foreign competition. But as my purpose was, at
this time, more to exhibit the character of this
"minimum principle," than to show how much the
tariff elevates prices, I will introduce three tables,
which, if examined, will readily explain the process,
and show that the principle resorted to, in order to
impose on the community, is glaringly unjust.

ment of foreign prices, and the rates of American
duties.
I will now present another view of the inequality
of the tariff lay of 1842, and of its enormously ex-
tiavagant rate of duty. In undertaking this, I have
again to advert to tabular and comparative state-
ments. In the preparation of them, I had re-
« to Senate's Report 67, 3d session of the
<27rh Congress, which was prepared by the. Secreta-
ry of State, Hin. Daniel Webster. By examining
the foreign prices of the several arUces therein men-
tioned and comparing them with the American pri-
ces we can form some adequate idea of the great
addition made to Americim prices by th® °Pe'aat^"
of our high tariff laws. We have but to look at the
price of any given article in the foreign market,
then add on the duty which the importer is now re-
quired to pay, when he introduces it m this coun-
try making some reasonable allowances for tieight
nnd profit, and we can readily perceivethe amount
addetl to the cost of such article when thus import-
ed to the American consumer. I have presented, m
this table several estimates of the rates of duty 1m-
nosed under the existing laws. The last column is
calculated on the seW articles on the prices given
in honorable Daniel Webster's report. But enough
will be here seen, it is supposed, to satisfy the un-
prejudiced, that great and serious injustice is infiiu-
ed on the country by the law as it now stands.
These tables show other instances than those heic-
tofore noticed of -low pnetd articles being heavily
taxed while the costly articles are but hghtly taXed*
Butas it is a matter better understood by^ study
nnd reflection, I will not detain the committee for
5?er rt.«Tw exhibit the result of my calculations;
before doing that, however, I will remark that the
table also contains the estimates both from the 1 iea--
urv Department and from importing merchants.

" we find, in each of these facts, arguments which
II should irresistibly lead J,his body to repeal this
unjust tax. This tax, as will be shown, is not im-
sed to raise a revenue for the purposes of govern-
ment. This salt tax is but another instance of the
crying injustice forced on the country to satiate the
cupidity of associated wealth. Here is a great lead-
ing and necessary article, consumed by both man
and beast, taxed nearly 100 percent. Why, they had
as well tax the-breadwe eat, the water we drink,
and the atmosphere we breathe. But why is salt
taxed? Wisdom and justice decline to sanction the
policy/ At whose instance, then, is this disgraceful
tax imposed? Ay, sir, let the Shy locks answer.
But, sir, I will' not argue this question. I prefer to
state facts. Again I give them m tabular statements.
Let the advocates of the tax refute them if they can.
Let the people understand them, and they will have
justice doner* .

Ihen 5oned So they present a pretty fair state-
MrTchairman: I now approach a subject of tax-
ation which, of all others, should be exempt from it.
It w the great and indispensable necessary of life
an article which should'be afforded to the: consu-
mers as cheap as legitimate enterprise and mdustiy
cln furnish it. Si." I allude to the article of sal .
Fno-land in 1818 repealed her salt tax. Mi.Gal-
Ktin while Secretary of the Treasury, informed the
to1'chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means (Mr. John Randolph,) that "the bounty
Son the exportation of pickled fish, pork, and
K is said toPbe no more than the *,0y on the salt
Sed in curing the same." In the foregoing able,
he vice of salt is stated at nine cents per
bushel and we impose on it, when imported a
dutv of eilht cents the bushel. When we conside
how many articles of considerable va ue are
SXis laid under——
Annual average amount of net revenue forthc ^ ^
Here is a succinct statement of one of the remark-
able features of the protective policy. We thus
impose a direct tax on imported salt of nearly H)U
per cent., and collect thereby #385,924, and squander
4984,029 65, and have paid into the treasury only
the trifling sum of #101,894 35, to aid m defraying
the expenses of government. Upon what pnnclp'«
of justice is it, that you permit fishermen to use
their salt duty free, and tax the farmers for * hat
they consume? But we manufacture m the United
States, perhaps, rather more salt than we import. So
the'tariif exacts from the community a large
for'the benefit of those engaged m that branch of
business in the shape of enhanced prices., For no
man can be so blind as seriously to contend, that f
the duties were removed, we would not get our salt
much lower. The, foreign price has been already
stated at nine cents the bushel; while 1" the United
States, it would average about 40 or 50 cents the
b"l proceed now to notices argument—no, sir an
absurdity, which the tariff party have recently at-
tempted to palm off on a credulous community.
Truth needs no spurious support. But a bad cause,
trembling with fear, and rfoting m illy acqu red
pelf) naturally quails as the beams of
Its deformity; at one moment a bold front is^as
numed and the tariff party demand of this govern
ment to pass laws to protect the proceeds of their
labor against the low prices induced by a free com-
petition, with what they are pleased to term the
"oauS labor of Europe." Tfhey urge that Jor-
elmrs can manufacture cheaper than the Americans.
What is the remedy proposed by our manufac-
turers for this evil of low p ices, as they ai e pleased
to characterize it? Why, a protective tariff. But
in what way carta simple law of Congress accom-
nlish this3 Why, it will keep ovl competitiou from
& Md enable the manufacturers to /orce the
people'here to pay them what they see fit to de-
mand. Unless thelawdo%tlVSV.P.X ™rsSeof
