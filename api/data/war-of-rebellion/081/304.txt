HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 22, 1864-6 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Birney advanced this morning his left to envelop the enemy. Wright advanced on his left by a road that separated him somewhat from Birney. Wright soon found the enemy's skirmishers and reported them in considerable force. Fearing Birney's left would be exposed, Barlow was ordered to move back so as to make connection with Wright. While doing this he was vigorously attacked and thrown into some confusion. At the same time Gibbon on the plank road (Birney's right) was very warmly attacked and forced back from his first line, losing I regret to say, four guns. Order was soon restored, but in view of these facts I directed the withdrawal of Wright, so as to make a secure connection with Birney. At this time all is quiet. It is reported, but I fear not reliable, that Gibbon has retaken his rifle-pits and guns. I have ordered Birney and Wright at 7 p.m. to make a vigorous attack and try to drive the enemy back. Prisoners report the whole of A. P. Hill's corps, with others, in our front. They say they marched out of their breast-works or fortifications, advancing nearly a mile. We have taken prisoners from each of the divisions of Hill's corps. The morale of the men is not so good as I would like it, but I deem it of the utmost consequence to take the offensive. Scouts on our left report Wilson at Reams' Station, on the Weldon railroad, at 10 a.m. to-day. They saw he burned the station and did other damage, but on retiring was attacked by cavalry and infantry. I hope to send you after dark some favorable news. A prisoner, who states he was on provost guard at Petersburg, reports the arrival there day before yesterday of troops from Johnston's army.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Our line advanced at 7 p.m. and has since been engaged. On the left and the center the enemy have been pressed back considerably; on the right no advantage was gained. Our lines are now secure and the effect of the advance has been good. I have ordered a general advance at daylight, and will try to push the enemy back to his works. I regret to say there is no confirmation of the report of the recapture of our guns. It is believed the enemy drew them off. We have taken about 100 prisoners; probably lost as many. Our casualties are, I think, light.
