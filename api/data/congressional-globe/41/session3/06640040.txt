APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 21,
Ho. of Keps.
Revenue Reform—Mr. Asper.
41st Cong....3d Sess.
from impost duties there should be only about
$100,000,000 raised.
If we start with $125,000,000 from impost
and excise duties each, we shall, in my belief,
run up in the second year to $300,000,000, if
we adjust the collection of the revenue in the
way we ought to. How can we adjust it? In
the language of the President, I would levy
the revenue upon articles of general consump-
tion which are not produced in this country,
but brought in by importation. So far as the
President states this in a general way he states
it in almost the identical language of the reve-
nue reformers ; but when he comes to descend
to details he errs, as perhaps we all do, because
in reference to details different individuals have
different ideas as to the way in which they
should be adjusted.
I believe, sir, we can raise a sufficient
amount of revenue by taxing from twenty-five
to thirty articles alone. I have tables which
bear me out conclusively in this idea of the
adjustment of the revenue. I have been at
some pains to investigate this matter, and Mr.
Young, the able statistician of the Treasury,
has furnished me with some statistics which
prove the revenue can be adjusted satisfactorily
in that way; so that while raising revenue
enough, we shall at the same time relieve the
great mass of the people, and remove from
trade and commerce the restrictions which
burden the whole country. I have here a state-
ment exhibiting the duties collected on certain
articles entering into our consumption in the
fiscal years of 1867,1868, 1869, and 1870. In
1867 we imported 34,185,241 pounds of tea, val-
ued at $10,839,326 30, from which we derived
a duty of over $8,000,000. In 1870 the increase
is very marked. There is an increase each
year; from $34,000,000 in 1867 to $37,000,-
000 in 1868; $39,000,000 in 1869, and $40,-
000,000 in 1870. During the four years named
there were 151,634,891J pounds of tea import-
ed into this country, the value of it was over
$12,000,000 in 1870, and the duty which came
into the Treasury was $10,203,047 19.
I shall not go over all the figures in detail,
as I intend to append them to my remarks.
1 shall only state a few of them to the House.
There were 253,571,664| pounds of coffee
brought into the country, which entered into
general consumption. Its value was over
twenty-five and a half million dollars, and it
brought into the Treasury $12,673,583. There
is a gradual increase in the importation and
consumption of coffee, running from a value
of $19,000,000in 1867, to $25,000,000 in 1870.
And so with sugar—there has been a gradual
increase; and so with sirup and molasses. I
have here also a statement of the importation
of spirits and wines. In 1867 we imported
over five million dollars' worth of spirits ; in
1870 over six million dollar's, bringing into the.
Treasury $8,252,035; and so with cigars and
tobacco, silks and their manufactures; wool,
and the manufactures of; cottons, and the
manufactures of.
I here annex to this part of my remarks
the tables, prepared at my request by Mr.
Young, the chief of the Bureau of Statistics,
to which I beg to call the attention of every
one interested in the prosperity of the country.
They are worth studying, and may help to
solve difficulties in the minds of those who
have been puzzled over this subject ;
