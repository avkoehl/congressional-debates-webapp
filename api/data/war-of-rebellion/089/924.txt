December 10, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Two deserters from Thirty-fifth Georgia, Thomas' brigade, came into our lines at noon yesterday. They report no changes in position of Thomas' brigade, which still holds the line between Swift Creek and the Appomattox, Pickett's right and Johnson's left. No other force between these divisions. Deserters from Wise's and Ransom's brigades, of Johnson's division, came into the lines of the Ninth Army Corps this a.m. No change in Johnson's front since the moving to the right day before yesterday. The division is considerably extended, and the intervals very great. Informants had heard of the arrival of part of Early's command, which took position somewhere on the right; had not heard of the movement of Hill's corps.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.

GENERAL: Two deserters from Forty-eighth Virginia, Terry's brigade, Gordon's division, came into our lines on Colonel Nugent's front, Second Army Corps, during the night; are recent conscripts, and joined their command the day before it left New Market for Richmond; estimate the force that left the Valley at 7,000; could see the entire column, trains and all, at points on the way from New Market to Waynesborough, where they took the cars; cannot tell what part of the line they are now occupying, but it is a portion of that lately held by Heth's division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Fifteen prisoners of war, taken by the Second Army Corps, General Miles' division, to-day, represent the cavalry brigades of Barringer and Butler, W. H. F. Lee's division. From one of them, who was at Dinwiddie Court-House on Thursday last, we learn that A. P. Hill's corps passed that place, said en route for Weldon. Their latest information of the Fifth Army Corps was at Jarratt's Station. Wickham's brigade of cavalry has lately left the Valley and joined the cavalry on north side of the James. Prisoners think we could have easily taken the South Side Railroad to-day, there being nothing to prevent; admit having falsely reported to one of our generals a large body of infantry near where they were captured, there being none in
