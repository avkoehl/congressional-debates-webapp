THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December IS,
he did, and their expenditures were more profuse
than they ever had been since he was connected
with the Government He had hoped at the last
session that the postponement of this installment
v, ould have had some effect to check their extrav
agant expenditures, but though he was disap-
pointed, he would again vote for the postpone-
ment with the same views He would, however,
take this occasion to say, that he never would
consent to vote a dollar foi this installment,which
he never regarded m the light of a debt, while
they had to borrow money The Senator from
Kentucky was entirely mistaken in regarding the
deposit act in the light of a promise to the States
There was no pledge, no obligation whatever
the act was one of expediency merely, and it had
fulfilled its object He repeated again that he
would never consent to give his vote to borrow
money to pay that installment
Mi NILDS said he did not purpose to enter
into an extended discussion of this subject, but
would only offer a few remarks in reply to the
suggestions of the gentleman on the other side of
the House, [Mr Clay, of Kentucky,] in which
asseitions had been made, and principles ad
vanced, which weie of an importance not to be
oveilooked It is row, sn, for the first time,
pioposed to raise a revenue for the puiposeof
a distribution among the States—to íaise money
from the people, m their individual capacity, to
be distributed among the States in their corporate
capacity, to mure to the benefit of chai teied mo
nopohes He (Mr N ) knew this was not in
tended, nor thought of, when the deposit bill was
passed by the Senate The object was to get i id
of an enormous suiplus which had accumulated,
and was distributed among ninety banks, expand
jngom already overgrown papersystem, corrupt-
ing the legislation of Congiess.and embarrassing
to public and private affairs On this ground he
voted for that bill, as did a majority of those who
voted with him But he contended that the ob
ject for which the bill had been passed was accom-
plished , the surplus had been deposited He asked
if it waspietendedby the feenatoi fiom Kentucky
that there is a surplus in the Treasury now, 01
would there be a surplus at the period pioposed
in the amendment Did not the gentleman know
that by the opeiation of his own law, (the com-
promise act,) the biennial reduction of the duties
on impoits would oeiur dunng the coming year,
thus lessening, by that amount, the fiscal re
botireesoi the Government' Undei these circum-
stances, to hold out the hope, as would be done
by the proposid amendment, that the fomth in
stallment would be ¡laid in January, 1840, when
there would be no suiplus in theTrcasmy, would
be to smction the idea that the money would be
laised by taxation This is the essential question,
and the only question befon the Senate But it
is said that the Government should redeem its
pit dge, that the good faith of the Government is
pledged for the payment of the fourth installment
oí deposit Sir, if it is a debt due by the Govern
ment to the Slates, it should b< dischaigod But
instead ot having any just claim for this money,
tin States are under obligations to Congress for
not lecliuming the three installments already de-
posit! d If it was not for the interposition of
Congiess, good faith would have required the
Secrcttiy of the Tuasury to recall the money de
posited with the States, for the necessities of the
Government, such was thespmt and lequisitions
of the act He, and the fnends who were with
him, had suppoited the bill in good faith as a de-
posit act, not a distnbution among the States It
was to be a deposit of a surplus This had been
accomplished, and the bill had fulfilled its func-
tions If it was intended as any more than a de-
posit act—for a distribution of money among the
States—then was oui legislation a fraud upon the
country
He would remaik, in reply to the Senator from
South Carolina, [Mr Calhoun,] who proposes
to vote for the amendment, that it may be an in-
ducement to retrenchment and economy in the
expt nditures of the Govei nment, that it would be
better to take a more direct method Let us ad
here to that first great principle, which he [Mr
C ] has so often and so ably advocated on this
floor, to íaise no more money from the people
than is necessary tor an economical admimstia-
tion of the Government This, sir, would be
preferable to cheeking a contemplated extravagant
expenditure by countenancing what is, techm
caiiy>   deposit—substantially, a distribution act
Mr BEtNTON remaiked that thp natuial prog-
ress of this thing had been distinctly pointed out
by him when he had the honoi, in connection
with, half a dozen othei gentlemen, to oppose the
deposit act He knew then that it was a distribu-
tion among the States He knew tha* it was the
commencement of a system of levying money
fiom the people, for those who would get it out
of the hands of the people He treated this act
then as a distribution, and scouted the idea of
its being a deposit He knew there was no sur-
plus in the Treasury, and said so, and that, in a
few years, we should be left without money He
stated these facts on this floor, m such strong
language, that a member came to him, and begged
him not to publish his remarks He stated then
that the effect of this act would be either to break
the deposit banks, or to compel them to crush
then debtois Everything he then said had been
verified to the letter We ha\e seen (said Mr
B ) a commitee of the directois of the banks of
New York, men of the highest intelligence, and
well versed xn financial affan s, placing at the head
of the teasons which compelled them to suspend
specie payments, the effect of this distnbution act
He (Mr B ) knew then as well as now, that one
of the effects of this act would be either to com
pel these deposit banks to choose between stop
ping themselves, 01 crushing those indebted to
them He knew then that in the short space of
two years we should be without money, and it
was now seen that he was right, for instead of
ciilmg back from the States any of the money
alieady distnbuted to them, as piovided for in the
many cautious words inserted in the act to make
it appear like a deposit, the Government was
driven to the expedient of raising money by a
forced loan, forTreasury notes were nothing but
a foiced loan from those to whom they were paid
Instead of calling on the States for a return of a
part of this money deposited with them, this body
was now reproached with abieach of faith to the
States for not going on to deposit the íemainder,
which was also claimed as a debt That which
in the fiist instance was declared to be a deposit
only, and treated on that floor as a deposit, was
now in the same place declared to be a debt, and
the FedeialG>vernment was taunted with a bleach
of faith foi not paying it
Now what was the effect of the motion under
consideration ' It was a dnect proposition, to be
earned on hereafter, of raising money by indirec-
tion for the purpose of distribution It was a
case in which the powerful and strong would be
arrayed against the weak I was a direct piop-
osition to commit this Government to the system
of depositing money with the States The effect
would be, that all that party who are in favor of
raising money of the whole to divide among the
few, would throw every vote to diminish just
and necessnry appropriations, and to keep up
the taxes The price of the public lands would
be kept up, and by the time the tariff act shall
have worked out its object in January, 1840,
there would be enough interested to band together
foi the purpose of raising from the Asiatic section
of the Union, the cotton growing States, a suffi-
cient sum foi distribution Your cotton crop,
(said Mi B ,) amounting to some hundred mil-
lions, will hold out strong temptations to the
friends of this system of distribution Mr B
said he had voted here for the last ten years
against this system of collecting money for dis-
tnbution He opposed it when it was proposed
by aSenatorftom New Jeisey, [Mi Dickerson,]
íoi the purpose of keeping up the tariff He op-
posed it with the same zeal when a subsequent
proposition was made to divide the proceeds of
the sales of the public lands, and again when ¡t
returned in the insidious shape of a deposit act
In all this he found himself sustained by the
young State of Missouu, for young as she was,
and destitute of resoui ces, she despised the whole
I policy of distribution Both branches of her
Legislature adopted a lesolution condemning the
whole thing, and mstiuctmg her Senators and
Representatives to oppose it forever In obedi
ence, then, to hei mstiuctions, as well as in ac-
cordance with the dictates of his own judgment,
he solemnly protested against the odious princi-
ple It was two hundred years since the Lord
Chancelloi Butleigh put into the mouth of Queen
Elizabeth the noble sentiment, that the best tre is
ury of a Government was the pockets of the peo-
ple This sentiment was, even \t that time, ic
ceived with rapture by a Bnlish Pniliamcnt but
it was still older tlidii the time of Ch-mcelloi Rui-
leigh, foi it was that punce of oiators and states-
men in the íepublic of Athens, (Demosthenes,)
when a vile scheme was proposed to raisi n oney
for a similar object, who indignantly trampleo.
the whole under foot, and then uttered the mem-
orable sentiment that has since been so often
quoted The author said, " No ' Leave this
money in the pockets of the people "When the
country needs it for her defense, call for it, and
the people will cheerfully give it " These (said
Mr  B ) are my sentiments
A proposition was made, the effect of which
was to commit the Senate to this system of dis-
tribution, and it had been said on that floor that
no harm could ensue from it It was like the old
woman's medicine of milk and water if it did no
good, it could do no harm Such language did
not belong to statesmen,norto the elevated theater
of an American Senate The whole proposition
waswiong to hold out to the American people
a scheme foi future distribution, which, it was
evident, could not be carried into effect without
resoitmg to taxation "What prospect was there,
he would ask, of its being realized } Look at the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury, and it
would be found that so far from there being any
suiplus to divide, the reverse was the case, that
there was a falling off of the revenue derived from
the ¡and sales, and a falling off of that derived
from the tariff, and the prospect was that by the
year 1840, theie would be a still gieater diminu-
tion At this very time we were hardly able to
meet the ordinary expenditures of the Govern-
ment, though we had been forced to the raising
of money by extraordmaiy means, such as selling
bonds, and issuing Treasury notes, which were
nothing more than"forced loans, yet we had been
called on for this fourth installment, and charged
with bieach of faith for not making it Are we
(said Mr B) under such circumstances,—to say
nothing of the principles of raising money for
distribution,—aie we to excite expectations in the
States that this Government is to raise eight oi
nine millions by taxation to be divided among
them > The effect of the vote taken on this prop-
osition, if, unhappily, it should be carried, would
be to make such States as were willing to accept
this money to look upon it as a pledge that this
nine millions was turned over to them, and, being
so, it would become the bounden duty of this
Government to provide the surplus by arresting
necessary appropriations, by raising new taxes,
by the issue of Treasury notes, and by a resort
to the old tariff, and when this much was done,
then all was done that was wanted The example
would be set, which would be followed up, of
raising money from the weaker portions of the
Union to divide among the stronger and more
populous parts of it Our revenues were derived
principally from the weaker parts of the Union—
from cotton, which, being carried to Europe, the
proceeds are brought back in merchandise, which
pays duties The agriculture of the "West also
contiibutes its share in the same way Then
(said Mr B ) adopt this proposition—only estab
lish the principle—and the South and West must
prepare themselves in future for a heavy course
of taxation, until the falsity and enormity of the
system shall eventually prostrate it Mr B said
he was opposed to a postponement to the next
year, or to the year after that He was for a post-
ponement, not only indefinitely, but in the strong-
est and clearest language that could be used He
was for an eternal, perpetual, and everlasting
postponement
Mr PRESTON concurred with the Senator
from Missouri in the impropriety of holding out
the idea that this installment would be paid in
1840 He did not think it proper that the Senate
should take such a course as would hold out -
fallacious hope, to deceive the States and the peo
pie of the United States In accordance with
these sentiments, he thought the proper course
would be to repeal at once the first section of the
deposit act, and if any Senator would make such
a motion he would support it He concuired m
the sentiment that the raising of money for dis-
tribution «as unconstitutional, and admitted that
he was mistaken m the operations of the deposit
