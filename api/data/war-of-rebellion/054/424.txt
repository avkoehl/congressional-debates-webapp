Report of Colonel John W. Foster, Sixty-fifth Indiana Infantry, commanding Second Cavalry Division.

DECEMBER 6, 1863.

One brigade of my division is at Mr. Fetridge's, 4 miles southeast of Maynardville; the other is 2 miles from it, between Log Mountain and Copper Ridge, on Bull Run Creek. Jones' cavalry division is just beyond Copper Ridge within sight of my pickets. Heavy skirmishing with him to-day, capturing a number of prisoners, including 1 captain and 70 fine horses.

Wheeler's cavalry corps is protecting Longstreet's rear. A part of his force is protecting Blain's Cross-Roads. His retreat is quite leisurely. My force is not large, and in bad condition. I will push the enemy as much as I can. Have the cavalry below communicate with me. Generals Foster and Willcox are at Tazewell.

God bless you.

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Division.
