GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say that you will at once transmit the following orders to Colonel Duckworth, at Oxford: He wishes him to get up three days' rations of corn for at least 1,500 horses at Oxford; also two days' rations of forage at Panola for a portion of General Gholson's brigade, say 400 or 500 horses. He will also get up two days' rations of corn and forage for his command to move with to this point; also two days' rations of provisions for Gholson's command, say 1,500, at Oxford. The above orders are given with a view of returning the forces under him to his own DIVISION, Brigadier- General Gholson's command being intended to take its place. You will further instruct him to put the railroad in good running repair from Oxford to Abbeville, if not in that condition now.
