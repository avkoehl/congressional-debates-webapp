the necessary force for the protection of the West-
ern frontier at 4 regiments ot infantry and three of
dra< oois, or about 7,000 men, but in this I do not
undeistarid him to include the posts on the Upper
Mississippi
General Games says, under date of August 17,
1S37, (vide same document )
"I am decidedly of opn on that, in addition to the posts anil
garrisons already placed on the frontier between thL mouth of
the Sabine and Missouri rivers, inclusively, there should be held
ready lor action a disposable foice oi six inousand men '
The amount oi force already there at that date I
am not able to state, but I conclude it could not
have been short ot two or three thousand Subse-
quently, under date of £ tbruary 28, 1838, (Doc
No ill ) General Gaines recommends a torce jC
8,910 nvnfor that tiontier
General Gratiot (vide Doc 59) estimates the
force necessary fur the protection of the Western
frontiei at 12,910, and General Cross, Acting
Cluartermaster General, estimates it at 7,000 men
I might give the opinions of many oiher distin-
guished ¿ti tienen on the!>e points, but enough, I
tiu t, is shown by those already quoted They are
the opinions of gentlemen who are well acquainted
with the sub] ct, and entitled to the most respectful
consideration, and, from all these, it is quite evt-
d"i t that the lowest number ot troops lequisite foi
t * pro eel on of tne Western frontier would be
i C00, oi upwards For the Atlartic coast, I
will tike i' e estimate of the chairman oi the Mili-
ta v Co am tti o, whi<~h is 3,400, and v hich is the
1< wist otiiiatt, and some 1,500 below the Secre-
t i y of Wdi, and then, it we allow thiee regiments,
ol l.uOOeaci, for the whole Northern or Canada
iiontier, including Maine, and including the forts
in W's" insin, which is a very low estimate, and
w >■( all i u e a force ol 12,400, which is just about
ihi amount m which the army will be increased by
a opi rf. t1- propositions, now belore us, ind in-
cluí rig tne new regiment to be reported by the
Military Committee, and all this is without any
e.tímate tor, or inference to, Florida or the Chero-
kee country, wheie, I believe, upwards of 4,000
troops aie now employed, and where, in any event,
considerable force «ill yet be required for some
time to come I know it is said that the Flonda
war is nearly ended, but, sir, it is not vet ended, and

It must be, evi tilt, tbtiefore that a force of from
twtlve thousand to fifteen thousand i« not only in
dispen'abl) necessary, but is tne lowest possible
i umber of winch c ur military establishment should
consist, i it i intended to afford by it any thing
like adequa < protection to the country W thout
an lticiease it the iimy, it seems ¡nevitab'e that
we must isoit to volunteers and militia, not lem-
p irarily merely, a id to- e ¡nergercies, but fo. a per-
mit entsf1  ding force
VVYhin the I¿st six years no less than forty-thtee

partment I lie average wcu'd be x,rm arils ot
seiei thousand per annum, an 1 I think, from a
careful examination cf the documents showing this
fac', that it may be safely stated that me number
foi the whole of that time has been equivalent to
four thousan 1 consiantly in se vice, though much
of the time during ihe Florida wai the number has
been much higher 'han that Is theie any proba-
bility that for the n*>xt five or six veais we snail
warn less military force man we have foi the la"t
si" ye<ir*i 4ie there muieations ot a >-tdie ol such
pioiound quiet a., to wariaut such a belief? On
thecoi'iary, sir, is it not evident that m allrtascn-
ab   probability we s1 ill lequae a greater military
ioic i I have already ailaded to the situation of
our IS i ihein and Western frontiers particulate,
an I it ( ns to me t nt no man can shut his eyes
to the net easily oi a considerable ind speedy aug
men'mono! force rn thosi frontier  I will not
institute a coirfanson as to th  relative efficiency
of volunteers ard regular troops If we are to
h?ve a standing army, it should be such a one, in
point of numbers, as ihe interests of the country
and the exigencies of the public service require,
and such a one as to obviate the necessity of con-
stantly calling, and almost permanently keeping;, m
the service the militia of the country or volunteers,
which is ahkp detrimental to the productive indus-
try of the country, and ruinous to the National
Treasury.
If an increase of the regular army is necessary
to enable the General Government to keep a na-
tional police to enforce its treaty stipulations and
obligations, and, above all, to afford that protec-
tion and security to its own citizens, which is the
first object and highest duty of all Governments,
then such increase must take place, without refe-
rence to the question of expense, or without stop-
p ng to inquire how much may be the cost, but, as
I  have shown that either such an increase is ne-
cessary, or that we must resort to the volunteer
system, I deem it, therefore, not improper to
call the attention of the committee to the relative
expense of volunteers, militia, and regular troops,
and to the vast disparity in the cost of maintaining
volunteers and regulars.
By a report from the War Department (Doc
No 271,) in answer to a resolution of this Hou^e
at this session, it will be seen that the expense of
a company of volunteers, not mounted, is about
double that of an infantry company in the regular
service, under all circumstances, but if the volun
teersare mounted, as most of them are, the diffe-
rence is still greater, and is, m fact,nearly six to one
The following extract from Gen Towson's let-
ter to the Secietary of War, in the report above
ai'uded to, exhibits this matter very clearly, and I
beg the especial attention of members to this ex-
tract, which is as follows
'* Mounted volunteers or militia are not wanted to supply the
place of dragoons or cavalry they are armed as infantry oi n
liemen, and m battle, act on foot as mfautrv Horses foi such
troops aie mmece saiv and so 1 r from iacilitatmg Ihe move-
ments ol in airiy, they retard and embarra&s it, especially in
unsettled courtnes, where the fo age must be transponed m
wagons, and the roads opened by tioops Notwithstanding this
most serious inconvenience thiee fourths of the volunteers that
have served m Indian wars have*been mounted, and, to form a
piopei estimate of the relative expense of suehtroops, the com
parison should be made with the "United fetates infantry to

&5 far, th^relore, as expen e is concerned,
every d-n'-ideftion of economy would indícale
the impioprietv of empoymg volunteers This
hss been one of the causes ot the enormous expen
di'ures of ihe Florida War In March, 183b, Ihe
Execut ve called upon Congress foi an mcreise of
the regulai army to enable him to avoid the ex-
pense and difficulties which have occured in the
volunteer "-jstem Congress, however, refused to
increase the army, but passed the act of 23d Mav,
1836, authorizing the empiO)mentof 10,0^0 vo-
lunteers
Volunteers were accordingly employed, and it
may not be irrelevant to trace, for a moi.ient, the
history of their employment and service in Flonda,
for a little more than two years past, and«ee how
army after army has been marched into and out of
Florida, at the most frightful expense, and with
comparatively small results.
1st. In January, 1836, when the news of Dade's
massacre reached New Orleans, General Gaines
raised a corps of volunteers, and, united with a
few regulars, marched them from Louisiana to
Florida, -where they served till the ensuing May,
■when they were marched back to their homes and
discharged
2d. In the month of February, of that year, an
army of militia and volunteers, about 3,000 strong,
was organized by General Scott, in South Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama, and marched to Florida,
where they served about sixty days, and were then
marched back and discharged.
3d. In June following, Governor Call undertook
a "summer campaign," and a brigade of mounted
volunteers was organized in Tennessee, and put in
march towards Florida. As his appeal to the peo-
ple of Florida for an auxiliary force proved una-
vailing, the summer campaign was abandoned,
and the Tennessee brigade halted for a while in the
Creek country It entered Florida late in Septem-
ber, and its term "f service expired in December,
when it took up the line of march on its return to
Tennessee, m the midst of the campaign then m
progress under the chief command of General Jesnp
4th This departure of the Tennessee brigade
imposed upon General 'Jesnp the necessity «f
calling upon Georgia and Alabama for another
contribution, and, accordingly, a corps of volun-
teers was organized in each of those States, and
marched from thence to Florida, where they served
until May, 1837, when they likewise took up their
line of return march to their homes after a little
more than three months' service.
5th. Next came the preparations for the cam-
paign of the past winter, in which a v ery large
volunteer force was drawn from Georgia, Ala-
bama, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mi^soari.
From this brief retrospect of the last two years,
it will be seen that five volunten armies have,
during that time, been organized and marched from
distant points to Florida to serve for shoit periods,
and then to march back again to iheir homes
The nature" of the country and climate is such that
no military operations can be carried on there rn
the summer, consequently these levies have gene-
rally been only for short periods, and during that
part of the season when the v, ar could be prose-
cuted
The expenses of mili ía and volonteer^, by the
act of 20th April, 1818, commer'-e th= moment
they leave then homes, and while ma'xhing to the
place of rendezvous, and continue til! they are
mauhed bacie again to their homes Sir, it is no
cause of wonder that the expenses if that war. un-
der this state of things, hive been so enormous,
and it is believed by jome tbit one half of the ex-
penses of that war have resilted f orn this volun-
teer sys'em, forced uoon he Executive by the act
oi Congress abov e lelened to, wrich, m tead of
providing him with tegular Uoons compelled him
to resort to th  employ ment of volunteeis and rai-
lttta.
Geneial Tovvson, in the extract above quoted,
alludes to the great importance of a rigid economy
and account loihty in relation to the military stores
and mateiiel of an army, and of the great diffi-
culty of mtusing that spirit of economy m raw and
inegular troops As germane to this point, apd to
sbow ¡he profuseness and extravagance which is
likelv to prevail with such troops, I will read an
extrdct, or a k\v of the items, from an account
against the United States, a copy of which, among
one or tvv o others in my possession, are certified by
the Acting duariermaster Geneial to be "Hue co-
pies ot originals in the hands ot Col. H Stoae,
Cluartermasier, to whom they were presented for
payment, and that 'hey are retained as fair sam-
ples oi the kind oí expenditures incurred by volun-
teers and militia "
The items to vv htoh I refer, are as follows, viz.
