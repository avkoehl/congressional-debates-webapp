THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 10,
men they may be able to find in the country
and let the work be done under their supervis-
ion, but I do not want another board which
shall divide the responsibility and thereby
relieve them to any extent from it.
But I said I did not rise to make a speech.
I merely desire to suggest that we are now on
the fifth day since this bill has been before the
Senate, and it is half past three o'clock in the
afternoon, and no appropriation bill has yet
been passed at this session.
Mr. STEVENSON. One.
Mr. WINDOM. If we adopt the general
custom of adjourning over Saturday, we shall
in a very short time adjourn until Monday, and
if this bill goes over until Monday, judging by
our experience this week, I think we may
safely expect to spend the next week in dis-
cussing it. I therefore hope I shall be in-
dulged if I make as earnest an appeal as I can
to the Senate to sit here to-day uutil we com-
plete this Indian bill.
Mr. THURMAN. Mr. President, I do not
wish to discuss this amendment, because I
fancy that everything that could be said for or
against it has been already said. I approve
the amendment. I see no inconsistency be-
tween the existence of these inspectors and
the existence of the present board of peace
commissioners.
But I wish to call attention to one thing
which may show the necessity for such a force
of inspectors, although I think it rather ehowa
& necessity for an examination nearer home.
In the course of yesterday's debate the Sen-
ator from Minnesota who has this bill in
charge, when I was speaking about the ex-
penses of the Indian department, interrupted
me with a question, and this occurred!
"Mr. Windom. Will the Senator allow me to
give him the figures 1
" Mr. Thuuman. Certainly.
" Jlr. Wisdom. Iamnot aware what the expenses
were the yej,r before; but taking the Statetnent
of the Senator from Delaware that they Were BO
high, last year the appropriations were $6,362,000, so
that we reduce $700,000 on that statement of last
year."
That is, the Senator from Delaware [Mr.
Saclsbury] had stated that the expenditures
for the year before last were $7,000,000, and
the Senator from Minnesota said that the ap-
propriations last year were only $6,362,000,
which was a reduction of Indian expenses of
about $700,000 ; and then he went on :
" This year the bill as reported is $5,334,000, redu-
cing nearly $1,000,000 this year, so that I think the
Senator's complaints of constantly increasing Indian
expenditures come in a bad time on this appropria-
tion bill, for it seems that last year, according to
the Senator from Delaware, we decreased $700,000,
and this year $907,997, so that we are on the down
grade within the last three or four years, and we
ought to be commended rather than discouraged."
Doubtless the Senator from Minnesota so
understood the matter because he looked at
the appropriations, but if he had looked at
the report of the expenditures he would have
found quite another state of affairs. I hold in
my hand the finance report laid on our table
but a day or two ago, and I find by that that
the expenditures for Indian affairs for the fis-
cal year ending June 30,1870, were, as I stated
yesterday, $3,407,000, omitting the odd dol-
lars ; w'at for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1871, which was the year spoken of by the
Senator from Delaware, the Indian expendi-
tures were $7,426,977 44. The Senator from
Minnesota conveyed the idea in his remarks
yesterday that there wag a decrease in these
expenditures of about $700,000 last year, for
he said that the appropriations last year were
only $6,362,000. But what were the expend-
itures for the last fiscal year, the year ending
June 30, 1872? Why, sir, by the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, which I hold
in my hand, they were $7,061,728. In other
words, they were nearly $700,000 more than
the appropriations, and so far from there being
a decrease of $700,000 in the amount expended
for Indian affairs from the year 1871 to the
year 1872, the decrease in expenditures wag
only three hundred and sixty odd thousand
dollars, while the expenditures, according to
this report, exceeded the appropriations, if
the Senator from Minnesota be correct in his
statement, that the appropriations were only
$6,862,000, nearly $700,000.
Now. 1 want some explanation of thus. I
want to know, if we only appropriated $6,362,-
000 for Indian service for the last fiscal year,
how it, is that the Indian Bureau has expended
$7,000,000 and more, nearly $700,000 more
than were appropriated. I should like to have
some explanation of that. Here is an official
report of the Secretary of the Treasury that
the expenditures that year were $7,001,728 82 j
he gives them to a cent; these were the actual
expenditures for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1872, and we are told bv the member of
the Committee on Appropriations who has the
matter in charge that the appropriations for
that same year were only $6,862,000.
Mr. WINDOM. The Senator will allow me
at that point to correct him. The appropria-
tions for the last year that I referred to were
the appropriations made at the last session of
Congress. Perhaps I should have said "for
this current year," but when I gave the Sen-
ator the figures, $6,362,062, I meant to state
them as the appropriations made at the last
session of Congress for this current year end-
ing the 30th of June next.
Mr. THURMAN. Then that is not what
the report of the remarks of the Senator
imported.
Mr. WINDOM. Perhaps I did not state
myself correctly.
Mr. THURMAN. The amount stated by
the Senator from Delaware was for the year
ending June 30, 1871, which he put at
$7,000,000, and then the Senator from Min-
nesota claimed that there had been a reduction
of $700,000 in the appropriations.
But, sir, how completely this bears out the
statement I made that in two years time these
expenditures have been doubled! We are
told that now they are being decreased ; that
you are on the down grade. Here is no such
thing as that, and nothing worth mentioning
in that direction. In 1870the Indian expendi-
tures were only $3,400,000; in 1871 they were
$7,426,000—more than doubled in one yearl
In 1872 they were $7,061,000—still more than
double what they were two years before. So
that it is literally true that since the inaugura-
tion of this so-called "peace policy" your
Indian expenditures have more than doubled.
That is the truth about it. So far there does
not appear to be any economy at all ; so far
nothing like economy is shown; but, on the
contrary, the expenditures have jumped up
i from the very time of the inauguration of this
! so-called peace policy more than one hundred
: per cent, in a single year, and continue to this
| day to be more than one hundred percent, on
what they had previously been.
It does seem to me that when we are expend-
ing money at that sort of rate, when we are
doubling our expenses in a single year, and
continuing them double in this way, we can-
not have too many safeguards to watch over
the Treasury and see that this money is not
wasted and thrown away or embezzled. I
shall therefore vote very cheerfully for the
amendment of the Senator from Nevada.
Mr. WINDOM. Mr. President, a single
word in answer to the statement made by the
Senator from Ohio, who, I think, has misun-
derstood what I said.
The entire expenses of the Indian depart-
ment for the year ending June 80, 1872, were
$7,061,728 82; for the year ending June 30,
1873, the appropriations are $6,362,062, mak-
ing a reduction of $699,666 as between those
two years.
Mr. THURMAN. Then the Senator has
different figures from those that I have in the
report before me. For the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1871, the expenditures were
$7,426,000 ; for the year ending June 30,1872,
$7,061,000. That mnkes a reduction of only
$365,000, not $600,000.
Mr. WINDOM. Perhaps I may have been
! unfortunate again in conveying my meaning
to the Senator from Ohio ; but I will try once
more. For the year ending June 30, 1871,
the expenses were as stated by the Senator
from Ohio. $7,426,997 ; for the year ending
June 30, 1872, $7,061,728, making a reduc-
tion of about $300,000. For the year ending
June 80th next, 1873, they vfrill be $6,362,002.
Mr. THURMAN. Those are the appropri-
ations.
Mr. WINDOM. Last year's appropriations
end next June.
Mr. THURMAN. That is the amount
appropriated.
Mr. WINDOM. That is the amount appro-
priated.
Mr. THURMAN. Can you give us any
guarantee that there will be no deficiency bill?
Mr. WINDOM. I know of no deficiency.
Mr. THURMAN. It will be the first time
in the history of the last ten years there has
not been a deficiency bill.
Mr. WINDOM. We take it as it now stands
by appropriation. For the year ending June
30, 1874, the present bill appropriates $5,334,-
065, making a diminution of §1,000,000.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment of thfe Senator from
Nevada.
Mr. HITCHCOCK. I offer the following
amendment to the amendment, to be added
to it :
And the office of superintendent of Indian affairs
is hereby abolished.
I offer this because, as I understand it, the
amendment proposed by the Senator from
Nevada is in accordance with the recommend-
ation of the peace commissioners, who rec-
ommend the appointment of an inspection
commission of this kind and the discontinu-
ance of the office of superintendent of Indian
affairs.
j Mr. STEWART. I hope that will not be
: adopted. That ought to be considered by the
committee.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment proposed by the
Senator from Nebraska to the amendment of
the Senator from Nevada.
i The amendment to the amendment was
, rejected—ayes nine, noeB not counted.
| Mr. CORBETT. I offer the last clause of
the bill prepared and read by the Senator from
Kentucky, [Mr. Stevenson,] which I think
should be added to the amendment of the
Senator from Nevada:
And when it is necessary in the Indian country
or at any agency that an inspector should receive
subsistence or board from an agent or other person
in the Indian service, the same shall not be furn-
ished free, but the person furnishing the' same shall
be paid by the Indian office at a rate not exceeding
three dollars a day.
This amendment is simply to prevent impo-
sition on an Indian agent who has to support
himself upon $1,500 a year, and to relieve the
inspector from any influence of the agent. He
does not wish to quarter himself upon' the
agent at the agent's expense. This was pre-
pared by the Indian peace commission, and
their bill was introduced by the Senator from
Massachusetts, [Mr. Wilson.] By adding
this clause to the pending amendment we
make the proposition similar to that, or very
nearly the same. I hope the amendment to
the amendment will be adopted.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Then
each one of these new officers get this salary,
as I understand the original amendment, and
this amendment is to give him his hoard in
addition, and he is to have mileage also? I
think we have provided a sufficient salary, and
I shall vote against both propositions. I
shall vote against the original amendment
because it is immature legislation ; and we
have it here thrust before the Senate at the
end of the consideration of a very large appro*
