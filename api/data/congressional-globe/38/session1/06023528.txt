THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 2,
annua! distillation of spi its in this country is not
less than 100,000,000 gallons; the amount ex-
* ported is usually about 10,000,000gallons; and the
amount consumed in manufactures is supposed
to be not moie than 5,000,000 gallons. Now,
allowing that there may be a decrease in the
amount of distillation in consequence of the high
price of grain as well as in consequence of the
high taxes imposed, upon liquors; conceding that
the production may be 25,000,000 gallons less than
heretofore, there will still remain 60,000,000 gal-
lons upon which a duty will be collected. I ven-
ture to argue that the amount of distillation will
not fall off very materially until the 1st of Febru-
ary next,when the duty upon hquois is to be in-
creased from $1 50 to $2 per gallon; so that the
amount produced for tins year will be nearly the
same as usual. Making, however, all allowances
for the falling off m the production and consump-
tion which some gentlemen expect, the revenue
upon this article should be based upon not less
. than 50,000,000 gallons, and will not be less than
$15,000,000, therefore, in excess of what it has
been estimated by Messrs. Orton and Rollins,
and will more likely be $30,000,000 more than
$15,000,000.
It was not my intention, Mr. Chairman, to dis-
cuss this bill at any length, i wish to show to
the House some of the data upon which the
•amount of revenue to be derived from the bill we
have passed has been mueh underestimated. I
do not like to have so crude ail estimate go forth
to damage the credit of the country, though of
course it was not so intended. There are many
oilier articles to whieh I might tefer. For in-
stance, the intiele of i'old watches to be assessed
at one dollar each appeaia to be omittul, (for
Schedule A is not increased enough to include
them.) No mention is made either in the esti-
mate referred to of pianos, nn which a tux is to
be pyid of two and four doliais each. The amount
We are to receive by inei'enaul luxes on stamps
will be found to add considerably to the levenue.
The increase ns vmy l.u^e both in amount and in
scope,umi I think may be fairly computed at not
Je.ss than $5,000,000 m-ne than the estimate of
jMesaii*. Orion and Rolling. The amount of in
, crease on the single article oflucifer mulches will
be not less than $2,000,000, and yet no mention
is made of them at all.
So of bank capital; beyond what is invested in
United Suites seeuiities no nolic.e is taken (if it
at all, and yet no tax will be more surely paid,
whatever it m.iy be Take the it< m of malt
liquors: the consumption in 18G0 was four mil-
lion bailed, and wnh tin* herh rale of tax now
imposed on wpinta will undoubtedly very hood
be not lesa than five or ssix million bairels, or as
soon as tno'ley can be had ai a reasonable pi ice.
Take the Hem of sueet ssions to real estate; tins
estimate places the amount to be received at
$750,000. Yet sve know that the whole real es-
tate of the country changi s hands as often as once
in thirty years or in the life of a generation. jNo
part of tins which passes each year can escape
the tax, and must laiy,eiy exceed that to be de-
rived fiom ii gaon s of peisonul property; but
these gentleman estimate the revenue upon lega-
cies at $2,000,000, or iicirly thiee nines as mueh
as upon the mine successions to leal estate,
whether by will or otherwise!
In lelation to licenses I eannot think t he general
clause by which everybody having a profession
or business by which a thousand doliais shall be
obtained was thought of, nor could it have been
borne in mind that wholesale dealers will be re-
quired to pay one dollar upon the sales of each
additional thousand dollars above fifty thousand
dollars.
These learned statisticians put down the reve-
nue from tobacco, snuff, and cigars at $20,000,000.
It cannot be less thail ^25,000,000; and it penalties
shall be exacted in all proper eases, it is very
likely to be more. The income tax is estimated
at jji30,000,000, and 1 think that is full enough,
although the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
calculates upon a much latger sum.
After making only reasonable com ctions it will
be seen that the amount to be anticipated will be
not lees than $40,000,000 beyond the Lite estimate
of Messrs. Orton and Rollins. 1 concede that the
bill vviii not produce so mu-'h the first month or
two after it go* 5j iulo op* uj\ ultuB  ftly
be reached; h-tr it i.l product a very largo
amount more the first year than Messrs. Orton
and Rollins have given us leason to expect.
1 shall publish in the Globe this last estimate
of Messrs. Oiton and Rollins, with some correc-
tions which appear proper to me; (A.) 1 will also
insert the estimate made by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue when the bill was first before the
House, (B;) and another by the Commissioner
(C) as it passed theSenate. The committee of con-
ference in almost every case, including the rates
on liquors, agreed upon the highest rates, so that
the act will bring in over twenty millions more
than it would as the bill left the Senate.

This is surely Lir^e enough to make our people
economical, to check all reckless extiav<n,'.uice,
and ^ive our securities a suhstantinl Itnindation
of Ci 1(111 hoie or elsewhere. 11 may not be known,
but I leaiti the inlnnnl revenue foi May or June
ktbl, I foi^et which, wa« ^35.000,000, and that
under the old hiw, or at the rate of ^180,000,000
pei year, w Inch \va° not expected to produce much
mine than $100,000,000 annually. There need
be no apprehension that the act of this session
will not bring forth all that its friends have claimed
for it.
In respect to the tax on incomes for 1863 it waa
fixed at three per cent, above $600and notabove
£10,000, and for all over $10,000 at five per cent.
This joint resolution piopohes to impose a sp< ciul
tax upon incomes of live percent, on all Mims ex-
ceeding $iGO0, payable out of the income of this
year and based on the list of last year. 1 think
as a whole, and taking it alone, there is no tax
more equal than an income tax. Oei tnmly it will
press mote severely upon my part of the country,
upon New England, than any other portion of
the country, whh peihnps the single exception
of the euy of New Yoi k, and it is in all eases to
be paid by those who aie able to pay it and who
have most at -take m Huntanurig the cieditof the
country.
Mr. BROOKS. Let me ask the gentleman from
Vermont how much revenue he expects to dt-
live from this joint resolution.
Mr. MORRILL. Not less than $20,000,000.
Tiie purpose is to meet the bounties which we
have just authorized by the enrollment act, and it
will just about do that. If we shall (?nlist by
bounties two bundled thousand men it will ie-
quire §20,000,000 to pay bounties, and this will
do it.
Mr. Chairman, this subject has been so thor-
oughly discussed during the present session of
Congress, that now, as we are approaching the
last hours of the session, no gentleman will desire
to make a speech upon the subject, and 1 will
therefore move that the committee rise tor the pur-
pose of closing debate.
Mr. DAVIS, of Maryland. I abk the gentle-
