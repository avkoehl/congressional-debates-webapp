reached my lines just before sunset, and finding that the list of prisoners was a long one and that the were many important objections to it which could not them be explained I without thinking of the injustice which for peculiar reasons it might be to you declined to receive them that night. I regret that under the circumstances I did not propose to receive them with the condition that the errors in rating, &amp;c., should be corrected thereafter.

Your action, general, in the case of Leroy Brown I properly appreciate.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General G. W. MORGAN,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Cumberland Gap.

GENERAL: Some days ago a negro boy came to our pickets and reported that he belonged to a lady in Mississippi; had been captured near Barbousville by the Federal cavalry, taken to the Gap and made to serve an officer there; that he sought the first opportunity to escape and brought off a horse equipped and two pistols belonging to the officer, Colonel Phillips, with whom he had been placed. He was received and permitted to dispose of the property from his benefit. On yesterday I was told that Colonel Gallup stated that they boy came voluntarily to the Gap, represented himself to be free and tendered his services to the officer. Under the circumstances I have ordered that the property be returned to Colonel Phillips. The horse and equipage will be sent to-day; the pistols as soon as they can be obtained from the holder who I believe is within my lines.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have the honor to deliver with this twenty-three prisoners of war and two citizens employed by the quartermaster's department, U. S. Army. I inclose herewith a list* of their names. It is not stated by whom they were paroled.

I will exchange the prisoners agreeably to your proposition of yesterday as soon as the necessary papers therefor can be perfected.

For the citizens I send to-day I ask no exchange. Upon what terms will you exchange Mr. A. L. McAfee, paroled and left at Pine Knot?

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
