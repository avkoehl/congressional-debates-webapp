1884.                                THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   133
the chattel     By this charter he had no power
granted     Befoie  ns  chatter, he had none te-
served ovei the custody or control of the deposites
To lie Treasurei, not to  the  Seoieta-y of the
Treasuiy, wis the custody committed, guaiantied
by «bond     rh^custody taken fiom the JFreasuier
to be confideJ to the buiA, reverted to the Treas
uiei when takei fiom the bank    Now, theSece
taiy pretenos to dcnve his custody power from a
pievious aulhoiitv, wi h wnich he was invested
before the deposites liad been confideJ to the bank
If such res^, ved power is p-oved not to have so
existed, tnen the i eoessary consequence is, that the
Secretary has exceeded his authority m removing
the deposites to o her buiks    \he b cretaiy fias, i
indeed, depended for his reserved powei on the i
nüthoiitv £,iven him to collect tne public levenue, '
but tlis rol ection gives him no power as to the I
custody, whi"i is mves'ed by law in another
Mr  II said, that as no member hid been found
w lung t) justify the reason put toith by tne foec
re ary of tieTieasuiy—that he, not the House,
had toe so'e i ght of removing the deposites, by
the terms of the charter—he thought ¡t haidly
required argument or illustration to reru e such a
pernicious doc'nne     However beneath the sub-
ject almost to discuss such a dogma, he might be
permitted to refer to an article that lately appeared ,
in one of th° public prints, which occurred in the
leign of Charles the 2J, as nonappropriate to the
present times, and in reference to the Secretaiy's
opinion      In that scrap of history, the Secretary J
would find somethng like a piecedei t     [Mr  H   |
h"ie quoted an o-cu-ience, in which the advisers ¡
of Ciarles the 21 had  interfered, to prevent the j
House of Commons of his time from appoint- ¡
ing supervisors, b/ whom the public money could ¡
be secured ]    After which he said he could not
concur with other leasons, that this power to i
remove was absolute and unconditional, for the I
peopl  and the bank, being both equally inteiested
liVhis acts, he thought that the true reason for
wl ich it was given was, to enable the House, if
that  power was not   rightfully or   satisfactorily
exercised, to restoie the deposites,  and th reby
the fai h of the nation, wnich was plighted by the
charter, that the deposites snould be given to the
bank, and he argued to show, that if the Secreta
ry's power was thus as chimed by him, to be un-
constitutional, that it must follow, that, although
the House might come to the conclus on that he,
in withdiawing the public funds fro-n the bank,
had done wrong, and from which they would direct
them to be restored, yet, that this duection—that
they should be íestored—would be rendered of no
effect, as he might subsequently a-t inaependent
of Congress, ard again and again withdraw them,
as often  as they should be restored     But was
it denied that Congress had the power of order-
in"- them  to  be restored?   If the doctrine was
sound, it must follow that the Congress was pow-
erless     tie could further show tnat the Secretary
himself had, in a subsequent part of his report,
stood self contradicted on  this very assumption,
for he admits that the powei giveil im by the act
incorporating the bank is the same, nenher more
noi less than that which was prev lously conferred
on the Treasuiy Department, and whicn he might
have rightfully exercised under the laws existing
before the charter was granted, winch authority,
to use his own words, "gave htm the power to
' take caie of the public money, and deposite it
' for safe keeping, and in convenient places "  But
wheie was it that the power was given, unlimited,
to him, previously to that given  by the chaitei >
Nowhere, and he tí erefore contended that if the
bank was sa<e as respec*°d the care of tne public
money, if it had acted as a faithful fiscal agent,
and had disbursed their money according to the
wants of .he Government, then the Sec-etary had
not   on his own admission, the authon'y given
him to iemove the pub' c funds, and he had over-
stepped his lutnonty                                     -i.v.
Neither could he assent to his doctrine that he
could remove the depoM'es whene\ er the public in
terest would, m his opinion, requ  e such i emoval
1 us was both unsound and dan «rous, for as it
would be difficult to asc itain exactly the precise
point of convenience by which lie would be really
,st,fied, he thought Congress never intended to
les s rh a powei, to be aUed upon by any single
individual,  at his sole will  and pleasure     He
would not go at length over the other grounds as-
sumed by the Secretary in relation to this, but he
would submit to the House, and maintain, that
from the true construction to be given to the act,
the bank had not only a legal, but they had an
equitable, nglu to the use and benefit arising fiom
the care of the public moneys, until the expi-
ration of the charter granted them, if it discharged
all those duties which had been erjoined by the
charter
The Secretary seemed to suppose that there
were no otner powers given,and the money cou'd
only remain there, until he might otherwise order
and direct But were there not many other pro-
visions in the act, gtantu °- important privileges,
and imposing on the ins nation many onerous
duties, and weie there not ample provisions to
compel the faithful discharge by the bank of those
duties ' Was there not amongst them, that one
imposing a bonus, to be paid for then privileges'
Although the gentleman from Georgia [Mr Jovds]
denied tnat this was to be deemed an equivalent
for depositing the public monej , yet the only rea-
son he had given for that denial was, that in the
act, introduced in 1814, such a right to the custody
of the public money was not inserted, but as it
was inserted in the piesent charter, it seemed to
him a more correct mfeience to suppose that the
right was inseited to show that it was to be secured
to the bank, and looking then to all the circum-
stances connected with the giantmg of the char-
ter, its provisions, and the remedy that was to be
applied in case any of the provisions were not
complied with, orlookingtn what ought to be done
for any misconduct committed in the management
of the institution, he thought that the Secretary
had mistaken h s lights, and pioceeded to exert a
penal power ovei the institution which did not
rightfully belong to him, in virtue of his office, as
the fiscal officer of the Gov ernment
If it was objected that the bank has violated the
charter, then it was in the power of the President
to cause the charter to be broken, and trus was in
the power of the judicial tubunals of the country
uo do, by the usual process of issuing a sate
facias
Mr H proceeded to examine the other leasons
given by the Secretary of the Treasury, " that the
bank was a monopoly," &c Whilst he agreed
that the bank had no actual right to tne renewal,
he called to the recollection of the House, that
when the bank was mcorpoiated.it was not cons d-
ered a monopoly At the commencement much
difficulty had occurred in procuring subscriptions
But now, there was, owing to this very institution,
such stability given to all other banking mstitu-
Uons, that their stock lists were filled up with avid-
ity The speculations of the Secretary, however,
on this head goes on, he tells you that the institu-
tion is dangerous to the lib°ities of the people
But this was not a new idea, the same had been
broached by the travelling agent, appointed by
Government to inquire into these bank matters
Who gave the Secretary power to declare all this,
or to regulate his action upon speculations as to
our liberties > The Secretiry sta'es also, that pub-
lic opinion has been declaied against the institution
On this, he would only remark, that in the last
presidential election, the question of rechartenng
the bank was not made at all i ne Secretary also
feared that there would be a large surplus revenue
m 183G, but this was disproved by the statement
made in his annual report on the finances, in which
he expresses a doubt that the levenue would be
adequate to the expenditure In this doubt he
fully concuired, as he had reason to know by in-
formation from mercantil  men that importations,
upon which of course duties were raised, owing to
the depressed state of ciedit, ard the want of funds,
must decrease enormously The bank had hitherto
been enabled to sustain the mercnants, from the
supenoi confidence placed in it, owing, he pre
sumed, to its uoiquity,as wed as its ample re
souices This institution now, however, dared
not to mcreise their iss„es, and he would deny
that, m the event of this bank being suffered to ex
pire, without renewing it, the State banks could
supply tne chasm that must anse upon such an
event in 183G
He wished to know, did the inducements held
out for the last three months warrant them in sup-
posing that there could be any alteration in the
system of the bank, so as to justify an opinion as
to its being unsound > During this period, under
all adverse circumstances, it not only paid all de-
mands upon it promptly, but it was seen coming
forward to sustain public credit, even the credit of
banks in the fiist commercial city in the country.
He desired they would appeal to the experience
they had of the value of the institution, in giving
to the country a sound and uniform currency He,
knowing this, could not assent to the doctrine of
the Secretary that his act would confer similar
benefits, or give uniform ty to the circulating me-
dium furnished, or to be furnished by the several
State banks which he selected as depositories for
the public money He thought it right that the
public mind should be disabused of the impression
that the bank had, by improper curtailments, pro-
duced the depreciation of the day No orders had
been given for such cuitadment, but, on the con-
traiy, when such a resohition had been submitted
to the board by the Government directors for a
gradual curtailment, this resolution, he could state,
was opposed by every stockholder-director save
one The bank had gone on in assisting the com-
mercial interests of the country, and had performed
all the duties assigned it as the fiscal agent of the
Government
But it was said (continued Mr H ) that, in ex-
cluding the Government directors from its commit-
tees, the bank had violated its charter. If this were
so, he thought the proper remedy was to apply to
the judicial tribunals He could not agree to the
doctrine that all the bank duties required seven
directors to execute tnem The board of directors,
he would presume, had a right to regard, in the
selection of tha Committees, the qualifications of
each person to be placed on them This was the
usual course taken here in their c >vn committees m
the House, and it would appear rather strange if
umbrage upon this point should betaken by those
who might not be selected by the Speaker upon
their own opinion of their fitness for such appoint-
ments, whilst 'he House vested that discretion in
theSpeakei which the directors of the bank claimed
for themselves He would not discuss the objec-
tion raised as to the three per cents , for it had
already been so often dissected, for him it never
required any othei refutation than that a commit-
tee of this House had mves'igated the subject, and
reported that it neither called for nor needed any
action on this subject He would have passed by
the charge as to the printing concerns of Gales &
Seaton, and to the owneiship of the National In-
telligencer, but that they flamed in the report But
he would take leave to bear testimony to their high
character—that no persons were less likely to be
employed in worfes of corruption. The bank had
been assailed by the Government and by the presa
in its influence, and was justified m repelling the
calumnies by which it was assailed It was rather
hard that this should be made a matter of reproach.
In conclusion, Mr H remarked, that as the coun-
try was oi the eve of a precipice, from which alone
it could be saved by a rightful decision in this ques-
tion, he trusted that their decision would be such
as to establish the industrious of all classes on the
sound and healthy position from which they had
been so recently driven
Mr ARCHER having obtained the floor, moved
an adjournment, which pre\ailed.
The House then adjourned
