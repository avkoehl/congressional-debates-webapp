If the principals be supposed to occupy the places of their substitutes in the field, about nine-tenths of the whole number in the service will be included between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years. In Georgia I found this to be so nearly the case that it was adopted in my calculations, and the result verified by estimates based upon other statistics and by other modes of calculation.

In South Carolina I found the number between eighteen and forty-five year of age eight hundred and ninety-five one-thousands of the whole number, or nine-tenths, nearly, and in Mississippi, I believe the same proportion will obtain. Therefore, without having the means of making this calculation for Virginia, I think it would be safe to base my estimate upon this proportion, then: The whole number of troops in the service between the ages of eighteen and sixty years being 153,876, the number disposed of from the State between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years would be 138,489+25,063 (the exempted)=163,552.

The census tables show that the whole State should furnish 221,000 between eighteen and forty-five years of age; but from this not accessible to the operations of the conscript law by reason of the occupation of the country by the enemy and the disloyal character of part of its population. Under these circumstances the State should have furnished 176,800 men between eighteen and forty-five years of age instead of 163,552, the number actually got in to the service. There remain, therefore, 13,248 men between eighteen and forty-five years of age to be accounted for. Of this number probably three-fourths are now in the portion of Virginia where the conscript law has been partially enforced, and where it is at present impossible to operate.

By making this allowance there remain of the available men between eighteen and forty-five years of age:

Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18,312

If the conscript law be extended to embrace men to fifty-five years of age, we shall have in the first place, according to census-

White males between 45 and 55 (36,465 less one-fifth). 29,172

White males between 55 and 60 (12,155 less one-third). 9,692

From these classes must be deducted the substitutes as follows:

From those between 45 and 55 (29,172) debut 12,000. . . . 17,172

From those between 55 and 60 (9,692) deduct 3,000. . . . . 6,692

Then, by the extension of the term to embrace persons to fifty-five, the State would furnish, between eighteen and forty-five-

The number arriving at the age of eighteen are estimated for only one-half of the population of the State. If the period be extended
