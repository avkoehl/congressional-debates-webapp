Brigadier-General WOOD,

Comdg. First Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you immediately on receipt of this order to move your command by the shortest route to the Rossville and La Fayette road, to support Colonel Harker's brigade if necessary. As that road will be your line of march, order your train under sufficient escort to follow you and move with you whole command to Gordon's Mills. If you find a force that you cannot handle, proceed with your whole command to the intersection of your road with a road leading across Chickamauga Creek to Dalton, bearing in well to your left, so as to communicate with the balance of the corps tonight.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GAFRIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
