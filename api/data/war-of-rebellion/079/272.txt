has been directed to bring up by way of Kingston to this point the supply trains, including all trains left behind in the last march. For fear that Colonel Fort may not have received the order you will also please direct him to bring up the trains accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. T. CLARK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

NEAR SPRINGTOWN, October 14, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel W. T. CLARK,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

In pursuance of orders received, I follow the Army of the Cumberland. I hardly think that I can find a road leading toward the railroad, and save time. All roads from the Rome-Calhoun road seem to converge at or near Adairsville. If the Army of the Cumberland keeps moving on as it does now I will be able to reach Calhoun between 1 and 2 p. m. Colonel Fort, chief quartermaster, received orders this a. m. to move the trains via Kingston toward Resaca.

Very respectfully,

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Resaca, Ga., October 14, 1864.

General OSTERHAUS, Calhoun:

Send word to General Cox if all is quiet on the road in the morning to pass the trains and teams to Resaca. You may march in by 7 a. m. without waiting, unless you have reason to believe our trains are threatened.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General John E. SMITH, Cartersville:

No danger to Resaca, but enemy went north on railroad and are destroying it toward Chattanooga, but don't know how far. Have passed Dalton toward Tunnel Hill, capturing garrison, and are also in Dug and Snake Creek Gaps. Hood's whole army is on the move. Will advise you more fully as we get information.
