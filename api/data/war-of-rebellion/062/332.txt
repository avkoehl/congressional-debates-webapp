per se, and that its defense would require very extended works, I come to the conclusion that the site of the work is correct. Distance from fort to city about 400 yards, to bayou about 1,200 yards, to forest in rear 1 1/2 miles. The fort may be effectually flanked by gun-boats. I have directed the attention of the commanding officer to the absolute necessity of raking two small bends in the levee which might give shelter to an enemy, and even to destroy them in an emergency. Our works at Port Hudson proceed well enough in spite of contrary undercurrents, but I need at least 10,000 feet of 3-inch plank to cover platforms, &amp;c. I can get lumber at Mount Pleasant, but it is green.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
