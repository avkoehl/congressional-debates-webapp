OFFICE OF THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR

THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY,

Newark, October 8, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: I have to-day seized 107 patented machines for sharpening cotton gins, Burden's patent, said to be almost indispensable at the South. They were made by James T. Cochrane, of this city, and were just packed and ready to be sent away. I learn that he has been sending them West during the summer to be smuggled to Tennessee. A man named Wormell came here from the South in May to superintend the work ans has been here ever since. Knowing that Cochrane had made these machines I cautioned him in May against sending any South. He promised not to do so but the proof is clear that he has. Is it best to take any proceedings against them?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. Q. KEASBEY,

U. S. Attorney.

STAMFORD, CONN., October 8, 1861.

F. W. SEWARD, Esq.,

Assistant Secretary of State, Washington.

MY DEAR SIR: I think it my duty to inform you that in an accidental interview with a gentleman of my acquaintance, a resident of Cuba, I was informed that Mr. C. J. Helm, our former consul-general to Havana, was making preparations to return to Havana as an agent for the Confederate Government. His intimate connection with Mr. Breckinridge, and close friendship with G. W. Smith, now a major-general in the rebel army, added to his own well-known do us some hurt in Cuba from his former position there I respectfully suggest the propriety of preventing his departure from the country in any of the Havana steamers.

Very respectfully,

R. W. SHUFELDT.
