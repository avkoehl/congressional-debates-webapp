to suppress the mutiny, and have not used it. From what I can learn, it is my opinion that the company will be content to be attached to an Arkansas regiment, and that it is believed by them that they are ordered to Colonel Young. The officer, no doubt, has exaggerated the facts.

The enemy have all left Doniphan and Pitman's Ferry. A small party crossed the river and burned McElrath's, on Fourche de Mas, 15 miles north of Pocahontas. A party went down to burn Bollinger's Mills (6 miles north of Pocahontas), but were frightened off. Captain Reves did not succeed in cutting off either detachment. As suggested in mine of the 28th ultimo, this force consisted of a part of McNeil's command. All of my men have been vaccinated. We are doing well, and have subsistence and forage bought to enable me to remain here four days longer. My agents are making the necessary arrangements on Eleven Points.

Major E. G. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant- General:

MAJOR: I have sent scouts to ascertain the position, number, &amp;c., of the enemy in Southeastern Missouri, from Ironton to Bloomfield, and between the mississippi and Current Rivers. I will send another small party in the morning. I shall start a party to ascertain the whereabouts of Totten's command, which marched eastward, leaving Rolla to the left. Though this force is thought to have gone to southeastern Missouri, the reports from that country do not confirm it. The same scout will be instructed to carefully notice the capacity of the country east of Houston, and on the line of Eleven Points and Jack's Fork, northward, to support a heavy cavalry force.

Captain Reves has, by my orders, reliable men on the trail of McNeil's men. Colonel Shaver has called upon me for a company for Captain Wells. I ordered that officer to take Dye's company, whereby I shall be relieved of any infection in it, and shall, at the same time, take the men from the immediate control of officers who do not suppress the insubordination said to exist in it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
