(Received 6. 30 p. m.)

Major General JOHN POPE:

A part of the Michigan Brigade, nearly two regiments, go out of service July or August. It will be useless to send them on the plains.

Don't You think so!

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., June 9, 1865.

(Received 6. 30 p. m.)

Major-General POPE:

I do not think it desirable to send any troops up here whose term of service expires before October 18. We cannot get them on the plains and back before their time expires. I have ordered a regiment out of Missouri to replace those in Michigan Brigade. I would like Second Ohio fitted out, but Captain Coryell says he has not got horses to fill requisition for Michigan Brigade. Let him fir that brigade out first.

G. M. DODGE,

Major- General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, June 9, 1865.

Colonel MYERS,

Saint Louis:

Can You fit up Cole's regiment at Saint louis with transportation for regiment and for sixty days' supplies, and send it to Omaha from Saint Louis! I have got to move one column up that way, thence up Loup Fork to east base of Black Hills. This will save long travel. Answer to- day.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
