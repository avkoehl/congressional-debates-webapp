Colonel Fourteenth Infantry, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-10.30 p. m.

General CRAWFORD:

You will immediately proceed with your division back to the Temple house, thence south on the plank road to the road to Reams' Station, and then along that road to the support of General Hancock. You will have command also of General White's division, which, I believe, will join you here, and also two brigades of Mott's division, now at Williams' house. The enemy broke through Hancock's right to-night. Willcox's division may be sufficient to enable him to drive the enemy back, but he will probably need more re-enforcements.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
