The New Creek cavalry has been ordered to Moorefield. Couriers have gone after them, and with orders not to spare horse-flesh. From all information there were not more than 100, perhaps not more than 50. They are riding very fast.

The first scouts sent our from new Creek has been heard from. At 12.30 o'clock they were three south of Purgitsville, and report that the rebels with prisoners took the Grassy Lick road. Major Troxed says:

A small scout is in my front: I hope to catch them before they reach Moorefield. I think it would be a good idea to send scouts to pickets at South Burlington. Imboden's command is reported at Moorefield. I will see. I am marching as rapidly as possible.
