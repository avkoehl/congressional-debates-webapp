er
the resolution by providing that the committee
"shall have authority to sit during the recess of
Congress. He thought the propriety of his amend-
ment must be obvious to all who wished to join
with the gentleman from Virgin a m the object he
had in view—' economy, retrenchment, and re-
form " With such a motto to begin with, and with
the gentlem ¡n from Virginia at the head of the
committee, and \*ith a committee composed of
members who would keep this motto in view, it
was only necessary to give the committee time to
prosecute their examination m different portions oí
the eoun'ry, especially at important points such a
our principal eitif s, to effect the important ends of
the propo ed inquiry Bat ¡f the House should
merely create a committee and then limit it to a
few days or wek*, ana coi fine its action to the
city of Washirgton, nothing valuable could be fc
complishfd
Mr GILMER, here mterpospd and said he
thought ne cou d tbvi„te the gentleman's objection
Let the crmmittee be or£ani7ed, let them make an
exper nrjní, and if on trial ihey should find they
could not obtain the information sought, then they
could ask, and would no doubt obtain power to sit
during the íecess, but there was no need of conter-
rmg on them this power m advance.
Mr BROWN said he knew, now, as well as he
should at the end of this session, that thecommittse
could not, in a few days or weeks, accomplish the
object of the r appointment Ha desired that they
should go lo Pailadelphia, to New York, and to
other premment prominent points wheie custom
houses were situated, and where large numbers of
public officers were in the employ of Government,
and see whether it was ner-essary that these persons
should still be retained in office. He had under-
stood that m Philadelphia theie were at least one-
third more than were n cessar/ to the duties of the
customhouse. He percened from the smaes of
gentlemen round him that they seeme4 fo consider
this remark as beanng on the course of the late
Administration, but he cared not where the cen-
sure might fall, or whom it might involve—ie re-
garded truth alone The resolution might be a
very good one, if not so limited as be rendered nu-
gatory, but if it was to be íestncted to the present
session, it could be of no u^e or advantage what-
ever
Mr B said that he bad heard it said, though he
could nst vouc1  for the tru'h of the statement, that
the number of custom house officers in Philade'-
phia had lately been increased, and ought to bf
diminished     Let die committee be empowered at j
once to continue its  ín^stigauons during there-
cess, he trusied  they would   hen examine  fu'ly
into the whole matte1', and, Mr B's word for it, if
such a course as this had b^en pursued at the  be-
ginning, they wou d have b en able to reduce the
public expendí ares down to the amount of the
public revenue, instead of screwing up the revenue
to the amount of the expenditures     He was glad
the resolution nai been introduced, it would show
the country that Congress went honestly for re-
form, and not for draining the pockets ot  the peo   i
pie when there was no need for it.   It would show
that gentlemen were honest in their profession', !
and would tend greatly to conciliate public conn- I
dcnc6
Mr   MORGAN  demanded the previous ques- I
tion, which v as seconded by the flouse, put, and
carnet1, and the main question being first put on i
Mr BrownV amendmen , it was negatived              I
Th  Question then recurrrg on the adoption of
the resolution—
Mr CAMPBELL of South Carolina inquired
of th° Chair wheih-r the task to oe confided to tb s
committee was no' strictly within the province and
power of the present s andmg committees of the
House?   It not, he would cheerfn ly vote for it

after petitions had been called, resolutions were not
in order'
The SPEAKER replied in the affirmative
Mr EVERETT said he should then object to all
resolutions until they were in order
Mr J C CL\RK moved a ^spension of the
rule, which motion prevailed And the rule being
suspended, and the resolut on being before the
House, and the question on its adoption—
Mr BOWNE of New York moved to amend by
inserting a provisioi "that sa d committfe be in-
structed to inquire and report to this House the
amount of stationery us^o, and by whom used, in
the recess between the wo sessions ctféhe Twenty-
swth Ctngress " Mr B s*id he wps told, and be-
lieved, that a greater amount o> stationery belong-
ing to the people was used during that recess, in
sending away documents, and oti er matters to af-
fect the public mind, than wa. consumed in trans-
ac'mg the business of the last ses ion He asked
his colleague to incorporate this amendment in his
resolution.

ALFORD, and CLARK—
Mr TRUMAN SMITH proposed the fol'ow-
mg proposit on, which, on his suggestion, Mr. J
C Clakk adopied, as a modification of his cwn
Resolved, That a se'ect committee of five be ap-
pointed to inquire into the con'n gent expenses of
this House, and into any corrupt, illegal, or impro-
per practices which ma/ nave existed cr which r'o
exist in this branch of the public service, and to
ascertain whether the expenditures, or some part
of them, have, not been wasteful and extravagant,
and whether the same can be reduced consistenly
with a proper discharge by this Hou e of its consti-
tutional duties, and whether ihe method of keeping
the aceoants of such expenditures cannot be im-
proved, and whether there are not more clerks and
other persons employed in the service of the
House ai;d in and aboat the Cap tol and the pub ic
grounds adjoining than the pnbnc good requires,

never had called he previaus question, yet he did

FAMILY OF IHE LVT£ PB-ESIOENT
On motion ot M" ADAMS, the Botu>e re«olved
itself into a Commit ee ot ihe Whole on the state of
the Union, (Mr Taiuffrro of Virginia in the
chrir ) on the bill for the relief of the widow of
the late William Henry Harrison, which was. read,
as follows:
A BILL for the relief of Mrs. Harrison, widow of
the late President of the Umied States.
Be ü enacted by the Sena'e and House of Represen-
tatives of tke Untied States of Jlm'itca i  Ctngress
assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury pay,
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise
appropriated, to Mrs Harrison, widow of William.
Henrj Harrison, late President of the United States,
or in the event of her death before payment, then
to the legal representatives of the said Wm. Henry
Harnscn, the sum of------
The bill having been read at the Clerk', table—             <
Mr ADAMS m-ved to fill thebUnn in the bill
with the sum of $25,009.
[Cr es m various parts of the Hall of "agreed,"
"agreed "
Mr A sa d that this sum, as far as he under-
stood, was in correspondence with the prevailing
sentiment of the joint committee raised on this sub-
ject, and of which the gentleman now in ihu Chair
had been a member There had been some diffe-
rence of opinion among the members of the com-
mittee as to the sum which it would be proper to
appropriate, and, also, on the pprt of one or two
gemlemen as to the constitutionality of t^e act lt-
selt in any shape There had b«en more objection
to ihe consti'utunahty than ¡h re hpd been as to
the sum proposed So far as there h d been any
d cussion ii th« committee, it ssetaed to be the
general sens  of those composmg it, tint some pro-
vision ought to be made íor the f^m ly of the ¡ale
President, not in the nature of a grant, but as an
indemnity for ac'ual expenses lactmed by himself
first, when a candidate for the Presidency. It had
been observed in the convtnit'i-e, an 1 it must be
known to til members of the House, that, m thesi-
tuat on in which Gen Harrison had bean p'aced—
far irom the s at of Government, and for eighteen
months or two years, wh'l  a candidate íor the
Pres dency, exposed to a heavy ba'den of expense
whicn he could not pos ibly avoid—it was no
more than equitable that he should, to a reasona-
ble degree, be indemnified. He had been thus
burdened while in circumstances not opulent, but,
on the contrary, it had been one ground on which
he had received so decided proof of the people's
favor, that through a long course of public service
he remained poor, which was m itself a demonstra-
tive proot that he had remained pure also Such
had been his condition before leaving home to
travel to the seat of Government After his arri-
val here, he had been exposed to another conside-
rable burden of expense, far beyond any amount
he had received from the public purse during the
short month he had contmaed to be President
His decease had left his family in circumstances
which would oe much improved by this act of
justice done to him by the people, through their
Representatives The feeling was believed to be
very general throughout the country, and without
distinction ot party, m favor of sucha measure Ap-
plications had come ft om the most respectable«ources
and, among others.from the city of Charleston, a por-
