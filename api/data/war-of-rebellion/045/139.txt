Major-General SANDFORD,

Albany:

The Government will be glad to have your city regiments hasten to Pennsylvania for any term of service. It is not possible to say how long they might be useful, but it is not expected that they would be detained more than three months, possibly not longer than twenty or thirty days. The would be accepted for three months, and discharged as soon as the present exigency is over. If aided at the present by your troops, the people of that State ought soon to be able to raise a sufficient force to relieve your city regiment.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
