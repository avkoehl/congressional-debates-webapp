Honorable S. P. CHASE,

Washington, D. C.:

The exigencies of the provost-marshal service demand that I should have some contingent fund at my disposal. One of your detectives needs $ 3,500 to-day, which I must try and borrow. Please order remittance of $ 10,000. The last I had was turned over to General Thomas, except a small sum. Accounts go to-day.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
