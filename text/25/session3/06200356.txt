the Union.   The struggle was long, strenuous,
and fearful   It is too recent to make it necessary
to do more than merely advert to it, and to say,
that it was finally composed by one of those com- |
promises characteristic of our institutions, and of ,
which the Constitution itself is the most signal '
instance.                                                                        i
The third is that in which we find ourselves.
Various causes, Mr. President, have contributed
to produce the existing excitement on the subject I
of abolition. The principal one, perhaps, is the
example of British emancipation of the slaves in
the islands adjacent to our country. Such is the
smilarity in laws, in language, in institutions, and
m common origin, between Great Britain and the I
United States, that no great measure of national
policy can be adopted in the one country without
producing a considerable degree of influence in
the other. Confounding the totally different cases
together, of the powers of the British Parliament
and those of the Congress of the United States,
and the totally different situations of the British
"West India Islands, and the slaves in the sover
eign and independent States of this Confederacy,
superficial men have inferred from the undecided
British experiment the practicability of the abo-
lition of slavery in these States The powers of I
the British Parliament are unlimited, and are often I
described to be omnipotent. The powers of the
American Congress, on the contrary, are few, j
cautiously limited, scrupulously excluding all that
are not granted, and, above all, carefully and ab |
solutely excluding all power over the existence or
continuance of slavery in the several States The
slaves, too, upon which British legislation oper-
ated were not in the bosom of the kingdom, but
in remote and feeble colonies, having no voice in
Parliament The West India slaveholder was
neither represented nor representative in that Par-
liament. And whilst I most fervently wish com-
Flete success to the British experiment of West
ndia emancipation, I confess that 1 have ftarful
forebodings of a disastrous termination of it
Whatever it may be, I think it must be admitted
that, if the British Parliament treated the West ¡
India slaves as freemen, it also treated the West
India fieemen as slaves If, instead of these I
slaves being separated by a wide ocean from the
parent country, three or four million of Afucan
negro slaves had been dispersed over England,
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, and their owneis
had been members of the British Parliament—a
case which would have presented some analogy to
that of our own country—does any one believe
that it would have been expedient or practicable
to have emancipated them, leaving them to re-
main, with all their embittered feelings, in the
United Kingdom, boundless as the powers of the
British Parliament are'
Other causes have conspired with the Butish
example to produce the existing excitement from
abolition     I say it with profound  regret, but
with no intention to occasion irritation here or
elsewhere, that there are persons in both parts of I
the Union who have sought to mingle abolition
with politics, and to array one portion  of the
Union against the other.    It is the misfortune in
free countries that, in high party times, a disposi
tion too often prevails to  seize hold of every-
thing which can strengthen the one side or weaken
the other    Charges of fosteung abolition de-
signs have been heedlessly and unjustly made
by one party against the other     Prior to the late
election of the present President of the United
States, he was charged with being an Abolition
ist, and abolition designs were imputed to many
of his supporters   Much as I was opposed to his
election, and am to his administration, I neither
share in making nor believing the truth of the
charge   He was scarcely installed in office before
the same charge was directed against those who
opposed his election
Mr. President, it is not true, and I rejoice that
it is not true, that either of the two great parties
in this country has any designs or aims at aboli-
tion I should deeply lament if it were true
I should consider, if it were true, that the danger
to the stability of our system would be infinitely
greater than any which does, I hope, actually
exist Whilst neither party can be, I think,
justly accused of any abolition tendency or pur-
pose, both have piofited, and both have been m-

jured, in particular localities, by the accession or
abstraction of abolition support. If the account
were fairly stated, I believe the party to which I
am opposed has profited much more, and been
injured much less, than that to which I belong
But I am far, for that reason, from being disposed
to accuse our adversaries of being Abolitionists.
And now, Mr. President, allow me to consider
the several cases in which the authority of Con-
gress is invoked by these abolition petitioners
upon the subject of domestic slavery The fiist
relates to it as it exists in the District of Colum-
bia. The following is the provision of the Con-
stitution of the United States in reference to that
matter*
" To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatso-
ever over such District (not exceeding ten miles ¡square)
as may by cession of particular States, and thp acceptance
of Congress, become the seat of Government of the United
States "
This provision preceded, in point of time, the
actual cessions which were made by the States
of Maryland and Virginia The object of the
cession wai to establish a seat of Government of
the United States, and the grant in the Constitu-
tion of exclusive legislation must be understood,
and should be always interpreted, as having íe-
lation to the object of the cession It was with
a full knowledge of this clause in the Constitu-
tion that thee two States ceded to the General
Govei nment the ten miles square constituting the
Distnct of Columbia In making the cession they
supposed that it was to be applied, and applied '
solely, to the pui poses of aseat of Government, for
which it was asked When it was made slavery
existed in both those Commonwealths and in the
ceded territory, as it now continues to exist in
all of them Neither Maryland nor Virginia
could have anticipated that, whilst the institution
remained within their respective limits, its abo-
lition would be attempted by Congress without
their consent Neither of them would piobably
have made an unconditional cession if they could
have anticipated such n result
From the nature of the provision in the Consti-
tution, and the avowed ob|ect of the acquisition |
of the terntoiy, two duties arise on the pait of
Congress     The first is, to  render the District
available, comfortable, and convenient, as i seat i
of Government of the whole Union, tin. other is, j
to govern the people within the Distuctsoas best
to promote their happiness and piospenty   These
objects are totally distinct in their nature, and, in
interpreting and exercising the gi ant of the powei
of exclusive legislation, that distinction should be
constantly borne in mind     Is it necessaiy, in
order to lender this place a comfortable seat of
the General Government, to abolish slavery within
its limits'   No one can or will advance such a
proposition   The Government has íemained here |
near forty years without the slightest inconveni-
ence from the presence of domestic slavery      Is
it necessary to the well being of the people of the
District that slavery should  be abolished fiom
amongst them'   They not only neither ask noi
desire, but are almost unanimously opposed to it
It exists here in the mildest and most mitigated
form     In a population of thirty nine thousand
eight hundred and thuty four there were, at the I
last enumeration of the population of the United
Stales, but six thousand one hundred and nine-
teen slaves   The number has not probably much i
increased since    They are dispersed over the ten '
miles square, engaged in  the quiet pursuits of
husbandry, or in menial offices in domestic life   <
If it weie necessary to the efficiency of this place ¡
as a seat of the General Government to abolish j
slavery, which is utterly denied, the abolition |
should be confined to the necessity which prompts
it, that is, to the limits of the city of Washington |
itself    Beyond those limits, persons concerned
in the Government of the United States have no
more to do with the inhabitants of the District
than they have with the inhabitants of the adja
cent counties of Maryland and Virginia which he
beyond the District
To abolish slavery within the District of Co-
lumbia, whilst it remains in Virginia and Mary- 1
land, situated as that District is, within the very |
heart of those States, would expose them to great
practical inconvenience  and annoyance      The |
I District would become a place of refuge and escape
Senate,
for fugitive slaves from the two States, and a place
from which a spirit of discontent, insubordination,
and insurrection might be fosteied and encoui-
aged in the two States Suppose, as was at
one time under consideration, Pennsylvania had
granted ten miles square within Us limits for the
purpose of a seat of the General Government-
could Congress, without a violation of good faith,
have introduced and established slavery within
the bosom of that Commonwealth in the ceded
territory, after she had abolished it so long ago
as the year 1780' Yet the inconvenience to Penn-
sylvania in the case supposed, would hate been
much less than that to Virginia and Maryland in
the case we are arguing.
It was upon this view of the subject that the
Senate, at its last session, solemnly declared that
it would be a violation of implied faith, resulting
from the transaction of the cession, to abolish
slavery within the District of Columbia And
would it not be' By implied faith is meant that
when a grant is made for one avowed and declared
puipose, known to the paities, the grant should
not be perverted to another purpose, unavowed
and undeclared, and injurious to the grantor.
The grant in the case we aie considering, of the
terntory of Columbia, was for a scat o) Govern-
ment Whatever power is necessaiy to accom-
plish that ob]tct is earned along by the grant
But the abolition of slavery is not necessaiy to
the enjoyment of this site as a seat of the General
Govei nment The grant in the Constitution of
exclusive power of legislation over the District,
was made to insure the exercise of an exclusive
authority of the General Government to render
this place a safe and secure seat of Govei nment,
and to promote the well-being of the inhabitants
of the Distnct The power granted ought to be
interpreted and exercised solely to the end for
which it was gi anted The language of the grant
was necessarily broad, comprehensive, and ex-
clusive, because all the exigencies which might
arise to lender this a secuie s°at of the Geneial
Government could not have been foreseen and
piovided for The language may possibly be
sufficiently comprehensive to include a power of
abolition, but it would not at all thence follow
that the power could be rightfully exercised.
The case may be íesembled to that of a plenipo-
tentiary invested with a plenary power, but who
at the same time, has positive instructions from
his Government as to the kind of treaty which he
is to negotiate and conclude If he violates those
instiuctions, and concludes a different tieaty,lns
Government is not bound by it, and if the foreign
Government is aware of the violation, it acts in
bad faith Or it may be illustrated by an exam-
ple drawn fiorn private life I am an mdorserfor
my fnend on a note discounted in bank He ap-
plies to me to indorse another to renew it, which
I do in blank Now this gives him power to
make any other use of my note which he pleases
But if, instead of applying it to the intended pur-
pose, he goes to a broker and sells it, thereby
doubling my responsibility forhim, he commits a
breach of tiust, and a violation of the good faith
implied in the whole transaction
But, Mr President, if this reasoning were as
erroneous as I believed it to be correct and con-
clusive, is the affair of the liberation of six thou-
sand negio slaves in this District, disconnected
with the three million slaves in the United States,
of sufficient magnitude to agitate, distract, and
embitter this great Confederacy'
The next case in which the petitioners ask the
exercise of the power of Congress, relates to sla-
very in the Territory of Florida
Florida is the extreme southern portion of the
United States It is bounded on all its land sides
by slave States, and is several hundred miles from
the nearest free State. It almost extends within
the tropics, and the nearest important island to
it on the water side is Cuba, a slave island This
simple statement of its geographical position
should of itself decide the question When, by
the treaty of 1819 with Spain, it was ceded to the
United States, slavery existed within it By the
terms of that treaty, the effects and property of
the inhabitants are secured to them, and they are
allowed to remove and take them away, if they
think proper to do so, without limitation as to
time     If it were expedient, therefore, to abolish
