HEADQUARTERS,New Market, Va. August 7, 1862

Major General D. H. HILL.

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: Your letter* of the 5th was received this morning. I regret to hear of the feeble conduct of your cavalry. Who is its commander and what is its strength? I hope you will see to its organization and instruction. The gunboat ought to have been destroyed. It may be too late attack it now; but if not, try it with incendiary shells. You must endeavor to make your present division superior to your former, and I have great confidence of your accomplishing it.

I hope you will lose no opportunity of damaging the enemy in every way. I fear I shall have to recall Pendleton soon. His command requires his presence, and his guns are wanted here now. His batteries may also be wanted around Richmond. The enemy appear extremely active, and are making their appearance at all points bearing on the city. Push on your defenses at Petersburg and around Drewry's Bluff. I wish to have Anderson's division liberated. It is wanted now. Get all the free black and slave labor you can, accomplish anything against the enemy at Coggins Point or his communication by the river do so at the earliest favorable moment.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

General.

Brigadier General JOHN B. HOOD.

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I desire you to prepare your two brigades to proceed to Hanover Junction as soon as practicable. I do not know your encampment but if you will designate the nearest point on the railroad where the train can take you up and where a portion of your force will be ready I will have the cars at the spot. You must make arrangements for your sick. Your very sick can be sent to the hospitals in Richmond. The others I hope will be well enough to accompany you. Take your wagon train and batteries. They must march.

Very truly and respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE.

Major General D. H. HILL.

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: Your letter* of the 7th is received,and in reply General Lee directs me to say that he does not think the enemy will make any serious attempt upon Petersburg. Should he land at Bailey's Creek it will be to threaten you, as he has just done at Malvern Hill, to cover some other design. He, however, recommends that you should be
