MOUNT STERLING, November 29, 1864.

Captain J. S. BUTLER:

Lieutenant-Colonel Ferguson arrived this evening; passed through Prestonburg to Louisville, and returned through Louisa by Morehead and Owingsville, and reports everything quiet this side Pound Gap. There are four Georgia regiments in the vicinity of the salt-works, and one doing picket duty from the gap to Abingdon. A rebel force supposed to be coming from Kanawha Valley, by Guyandotte River and Louisa, to invade Kentucky; don't know the commander or size of force, but he believes there is some truth in the rumor. I feel secure here, and have no apprehension of immediate attack. Four hundred and fifty of the Thirty-ninth Kentucky started from Louisa, and 122 arrived this evening; all the rest deserted, except a few taken sick. I will write you by to-morrow's mail.
