Brigade commanders will hold their commands in readiness to march promptly at 3 a.m. to-morrow. Tattoo will be beaten at the usual time this evening, and after tattoo the officers will see that the men go to sleep in order that they may have a good night's rest. There will be no reveille in the morning. The troops will be kept well at hand, so that they can be aroused without unnecessary noise. The burning of rubbish or dry lumber, which has been collected in the camps, and which is usually burned before a march, is strictly forbidden. There will be no unnecessary fires whatever either to-night or to-morrow morning. The movement will be made as quickly as possible, so as not to excite the suspicion of the enemy. Brigade commanders will be held responsible that these directions are carried out.

By command of Brigadier General O. B. Willcox:
