HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,October 28, 1864.

Major-General MOWER,

Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

GENERAL: After crossing the Chattanooga you will please have your rear guard destroy the bridge (Schofield's); also destroy the bridge at Gaylesville, if the Fourteenth Corps has not done it already. I think it best for your entire command to cross Schofield's Chattanooga bridge, and not the one your pioneers built.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S. -Headquarters at Cedar Bluff to-night.
