tended it should be    This new of the subject Mr M enlarged
upon
Mr M held that this Constitution was only destined to carry
out the powers belonging to the United States, according to the
original articlesol cession, and, to establish the position he as
sumed, Mr M adverted to the aiticles ot cession of Virginia
To these opinions he called the attention of the gendeman
from Maine and of the committee They were they political
opinions too of the political associates ef the gent'eman fiom
Maine They were the opinions of the Georgia Legislature,
composed not of a small majouty, butof a majority of moie
than ninety of 'hat gent'eman's own political Inends, who had
taken care to express then opinions on this subject Speaking
of the deeds and relinquishments which were made, the 601
gia Legislature wenton to declare that these deeds and lehn
quishsnents were made for the common benefit of the people
of the United Stages, that this was a common fund, tn be distri-
buted without partiality
Another point at issue between them wai this that we
might have a claim to the land ceded, and yet have no ri"ht
to .the purchased lands, because they were paid for by taxation
imposed, and not by any funds contributed from the Mates
themselves Tne political friends of the gentleman uiGroigia
held a different doctrine, they said that the land, both ceded
and purchased, was a common fund, to be divided between ail
the States m an impartial manner
The gentleman fiom Maine asserted that we had no right to
distribute the money, because, even conceding the punciple
contended for to be true, that the Government wis the trustee,
yet that the trustee or agent had a light to be reirobui«ed for
all moneys expended for the benefit of the States He (Mr
M ) agreed to this but wished to see w iether this, tiustee had
not already been reimbuised Mr M here went into some
statements to show that so far from the r ublic lands being m
debted to the United States, the United States was 11 debted to
the public lands, that the agent had tyen reimbursed, and that
there was belonging to the estate the sum oí seveial millions ol
dollars.
The gentleman from Mame had said that theie would be a
deficiency created in the revenue by the passage ol this bill,
and that the consequence must bea resort to taxation to supp y
it It was true that the sum 0 thiee and a half millions would
be withdrawn from the Treasury annua,iy, and that there
must bea deficiency to that amount IIjv  was it to he sup
plied? He (Mr M ) would say, impose di us not only on uxu
ríes, but on silk and worsted goods The gentleman had as
serted that we could not hy this means procure t íe s22 OJO.OJO
required for the expenditures of the Government—that there
would still be a deficiency of six millions Mr M went on to
say that the party in power intended to show that the
«22,000,000 was not the sma lest amount foi which an economi
cal Government could be administered—and then to extmtne
some of the calculations submitted by Mr Clifford, with a
view to show that in ceitam respecio that gentleman was m
error
10 him (Mr M ) it was a matter of no moment that the gen
tleman should tell us that we should be compelled to levy tlu
ties to meet a deficiency The only question Í01 him (?7i M)
was, to whom did the public dom m belurg? Was it to tne
United States Government as a Government! If so, we had no
n=ht to distubute the pioceeds, and it wotlid be profligate, be
log in debt, to do so, an 1 then to raise íevenu by taxation
But if the demam was the propeity of the totales arid n it ol the
General Government, it was immaterial to what exlcu the
Geneial Government might be embmassed—we h-d 110 light
to touch a piopeity which had been confided to us in good
faith                                                                                      ,   ,
Mr M here alluded to the three projects which were before
the countiy in lelation to ihe public domain, and to one of
which the gentleman fram Mime ha I declared himself to be fa
vorable                                        
The first was the pre emvtion system, a measuielor which,
under proper circu nstance the gentleman fiom Mame wou'd
go That was huta system (Mi M 'aid) to (¡now the pub
lie lands into the possession ot those who had got the fleetest
heels
The second was the cession system—a bribe which was
thrown out to the States foi nothing unless to be available at tne
next electio 1
The third was this distlibution (nil Remove the objec
tions from this bill, and lis (Mi M) would support it col
dially Ihe othei twone repudiated as unworthy ot his sup
port
At was sud that this - as buta movement malefoi too pur
pose of inducing the Government to assume the debts ol the
States Iltlt it was not so an I, 11 it weie, he would not he
prevented from doing w lat waeiigit now, because hereauer
he mi ht be asked to do what was  rong Tne states ot Con
necticut and North Carolina (nei hei 01 which s ates he ui
deretoodwa« 111 dtbl) had both pre«en ed resolutions in lav or
ofthismeasuie His own Male was favorable to the princ 1 le,
but opposed t> this paiticular plan, and had instructed hei
Stnatois and requested her kepiesematives to vote lor it on
principle, and tor objections which he would state This met
sure, then, did not Jiignate 111a disposition loi the assump
non of the State it bis i\oth n« could ever induce lmn to vo e
for such an ass imption, uncoi su utional and iniquitous as he
believed it to be Bu< there was no need to opposed meas e
which might never m his life be presented to an American
Congress                                                     ,   ,
Mr M adverted to the benefits to lesul from distnbu 101 m
relievm  the Sta es ol the!' debts, and in re'ieving the pnv a e
embarrassments of the people And he said that in the btate
of Georgia the fall election lor Gov. rn n hung u] on the ques
tion whether the Government should lelieve the people-Horn
their debts or not The Goveinoi of that State hail called upon
the Legislature foi thieemiHio is ot dollars to enab e the peo
pie to pay then debts It was not lone And if this distr ou
non principle prrvuhd it would give the people of Georgia
that relief which they had aske 1 the Geoigia L gi«'a uie to e\
tend to them, hut waich could not be done
His objections tothisbili weie not to the principle but be
caused proposed an untusu dista ution among the states Mi
M here read apouionof the fiist section, winch gives toinie
States ten per cent on the amount ol the J ublic sal s heure
the othei States could r (.elve adollar He read aKi the seventh
section, which gives to each of the said St ttes400 0l)t at tes of
land,«fcc and then lead a statement showing hovv much land
had already been ee led to these nine States
Ithadbeen uiged in justification of this, th it these State 
were increasing moie than the other States   Was this a collect
principle1! As the census was taken, so was the distlibution
made But was thro exact justice? Would you, Shyloek like
have the last pound of fle&h before you do justice to others?
If this was 1 ight,then adopta íule by wh'rh eachSiateshould
receive an amount accoiding to its population Mi M referred
to the vastly increasing population of pome of the other States
All he asked wasjustice—deal out justice, and he had not a
word to say
Anothei js-artnei a'so wad in loduced into this bill—the Dis
trict of Columbia *3tiike out the first s etion of the bill, and
remove this other paitner from the concern and he would
come in and support the measure, which, m principle, he be
llevedlobejnst and right
Mr I G FLOYD said Shakspeare told us that when the
mad Prince Hal had been for a long time, on account of his
vices 111 the shale of the K11 g's displeasure by dlut of good
promisf s he was restored to royal favor He has ened with
the joyful mteili' nee to his bottle companion and depen
dant, Falsía!), anl here is the dialogue that passed between
them
' P Hem y I am good fnends with my father, and may do
any thug
Fiú Rob me me the exi hequer the ill st thing thou do st '
He Oír Tlovd) could fancv that there was something of
this kind goi ig 01 in this country He could fancy that we
had here a Prince Hal, who foihis tricks 01 misconduct, had
long been ir the shadcofp ipulai displeasure He (culdima
gine that this Pin ce Hal should fancy he had been restored t)
favoi, andthat heshouldsaj with a swiggelitig air, 'lcai do
any tinnc, and thrt a thousand cmgmg throats, as wilhthe
rush ol mighty waters should cry out' rob us the excheq lerthe
fiist thing thou do'st "
He had no doubt this would be done, and that this was the
first in a sel es of measures the object of which was to feed par
ti«ans by millions of the public wealth He then examined the
terms of cession by the States—the right by conquest—and the
right by purchase proper, as was the case with the Floridas and
loiiis.a d and digued from these several modes of cession that
< ongress had no power to grant away these lands He come d
ed that the Revolutionary pensions and the Indian annuities,
were equit ble and sound claims upon the public lands, and
said tint they amounted to more annually than the íeceipts
f'om the pub ic land"
Mr F als m lijec'edto the bill beca ise, in the words of Mr
Webster, it feiti i7ed the uch man's field hy he owcatof the

this was a rroposition to pay the e debts out of a fund which

amount of seventy nine millions of doüfírs' Does any gentle-
man bel.eve this? Or must not the estimates on which the gei\- "
tleman from Mame relied so confidently be grossly erroneous?
I again call the attention of gentlemen to a document of espe-
cial authority and importance, it is document ¡So 460 of th«
Twenty «ixth Congress, being the repoit of a select commute*
of the Senate, to whom the bill of the distinguished Senator
from South Carolina [Mr Calhoun] was referred—it bill not
for the distribution of the proceeds oí the public lands, but for
the absolute Cession of the lands themselves to tfae States in.
which they happen to lie If at that time—viz in líSO—trier*
had been a balance due the United States for the administration
of the public lie Is, 10 it very hkefy that the keen eye of th*
very astute chau man of that committee a Senator from Michi'
gan, [Mi NoRVSix,] would not have discovered It? But does
he, in his repou 1 retend any such thingi Not at all. On the
j pry broadestt«tina!ehemade, the expenditures aie not over
$550 000 per annum And f, hat do those expenses include, ac-
cording to Mr Norvell? All the grants to the States and Tern-
Une , for all pm poses whatevei, for public schools, for roads
and canals ¿Lc besides ail the 1 cidental expenses of adminis-
tering the land i'self, such as the stuvey and the land officers,
yet, with all tb"se items included, the cost of the whole is not
ov.rs'í 0000a year ]\ow allow thisratefor 46 years, and
what doeo it come to? 825,300,100 To this add the purchase
money for Lom« a°a a id i londa, which I place at twenty mil-
lions and you have the erand aggregate of $45,300,000, while,
in the same time, the receip's, according to Mr Benton, amount
to ¿104 545 490 leaving a clear and clean balance in our hands
of ©59 245 490 So thai, so far fi om having been a dead weight,
a chaige upon the Government, the public lands have yielded to
it an income txeeedn.g fifty nine millions of dollars
So much ft r the gentleman's document YetstilJhe tell

made up aecoidmg to his own interrogatories, I rely on a pub-
lic printed documen,, foimd m the records of your Government,
and returned to the Sena e by a committee of that body act.
ing urdei thi ir oaths This I hope will be sufficient to correct
one error, which I greatly dislike should go out to the country.
Ido not desire it should be undeisioodby the country tluuou?
public domain has been to this Goverrment a burden, instead
of asomceofpiofit No, sir, from that source it is we have
been enabled 10 pay ofi the debt of ihe Revolution, besides much
of the debt of tin war of 1812, taxes have been alleviated, and
we have paid the public debts wi hout oppressing the industry
oftheoountry
Gentlemen insist theie is no obligation upon us to look at the
provisions ol the deeds of cession fiom the States, or to admi
mster the lands in confoimoy to the stipulations theie contained.
But I ins st that we aie nder the same obligation now in
1811 to proceed iccordmtr to the stipulations m the deeds of
cession «ofai as it «halt be piacticab'e, as the Confederation
were it the t me thcgrints weremade To my mind there is
