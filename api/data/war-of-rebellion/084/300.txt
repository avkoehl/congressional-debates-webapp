We need 300 stand of arms.

HEADQUARTERS POST, Richmond, Mo., July 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,Commanding, &., Saint Joseph, Mo.:

GENERAL: I have just called in the officers of Fifty-first Regiment who were present at this post and held a council, and we are of but one opinion, which is as expressed in the foregoing opinion. The devils are killing some of the best of our county after taking them prisoners. The lives of our good men are worth far more than the expense of a short campaign. A, B, C, D, E, F, and G of our regiment will do to rely upon. H, I, and K are composed principally of sympathizers. But for the timely approach of the Colorado forces on Monday morning this post would have been attacked by some 300 guerrillas. They were approaching from the west and turned north when about two and a half or three miles from town. We had prepared to receive them and determined on a vigorous defense,but never to surrender.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. P. WHITMER,

Captain, Commanding Post.

UTICA, MO., July 20, 1864-12.10 a.m.

General C. B. FISK:

SIR: I have just received reliable information that the rebels made a dash on Captain Fortune's company, stationed at Black Oak Grove,
