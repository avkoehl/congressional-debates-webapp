of breast-works at this place, when my battery opened fire on their advance and made them fall back. About 8 a.m., on the open field about 1,800 yards to the left, a strong cavalry force, said to belong to Fitzhugh Lee's corps, formed in line, on which I commenced firing with solid shot with such effect that they dispersed. About 9 o'clock they planted four rifled guns at the same place and two other pieces, each 2,000 yards to their left near two small barns, and opened fire on our lines from both positions, which we returned with good success, blowing up one of their limbers. Firing on both sides ceased at 12 m. During the engagement only two horses were killed. Ammunition expended: 104 solid shot, 203 spherical case, 95 shell, and 10 canister.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHRISTIAN WOERNER,
