number. I have since heard, however, that my reports, returns, &amp;c., are to be made to yourself. This will account for my seeming negligence, as I have been reporting regularly to the headquarters of General Ripley, in Charleston. It is proper (not having [been] informed of any general officer having been appointed to the command of this district), being responsible for this section of country, that I should inform you that a great portion of my force here, consisting of 650 men of Harllee's Legion, will, under the late act of the legislature, be disbanded within a week. Also that Captain Walker's company of horse, Black's battalion, under orders from General Lee's headquarters, has been ordered to report to Colonel Black, and is now on the road to join him. This will leave me with but my own regiment (the Tenth) not more than 800 strong, as the measles and mumps have broken out amongst them; two small companies of State cavalry (volunteers), together numbering 70 men; one section of artillery, 30 men, badly horsed, and 20 mounted riflemen.

With the long line of coast to be watched and guarded, the force that will be left me on the 1st January will scarcely be adequate. I am aware that there are other more exposed and more important districts, requiring all the available force for its defense, and it may not be possible to re-enforce me. I do, however, desire it known of what my means of defense consist, so that more may not be expected of me than my force would warrant. It would be well if I could get another company of cavalry; a battery of artillery also. There is a State battery here, four iron 6-pounders, old carriages, but in good order, with harness and ammunition. Were I furnished with horses I could make good use of them.

Effective force of First Military District after the disbandment of Harllee's Legion.

Captain T. A. WASHINGTON,

Coosawhatchie:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter from General Lee of the date of December 24.* In answer to the inquiries concerning Elford's and Means' regiments, I have the honor to inclose letters from both of those colonels, showing the state of those regiments. Other information respecting them, as well as any knowledge of their or other troops reporting here, I generally get from inquiry after their arrival.

I duly received the dispatch from General Lee concerning General Evans. Previously General Evans had sent to me, and I ordered the Holcombe Legion, about 650 strong, and the best of the new troops, to
