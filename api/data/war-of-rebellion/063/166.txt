SIR: I have the honor to report that Mr. Ripley, who lives on Bijou Creek, on the evening of the 11th instant came into Camp Sanborn, and reported that his stock and the stock of all the ranches in his neighborhood had been driven off by a warlike party of Indians, and requested Captain Sanborn, commanding camp, to send with him troops to recover his stock.
