Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, April 21, 1864.

Colonel POWELL CLAYTON,

Commanding, Pine Bluff:

My dispatch of last night should have read, "200 cavalry and as many more as you can send." If you can still spare more after the 200 that are coming to Little Rock, it might be well for them to go with Captain Dunham, bearer of dispatches to General Steele. General Banks had a severe fight at Pleasant Hill on the 8th and 9th; enemy's loss, 5,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners.

Respectfully,

W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, April 21, 1864.

Colonel POWELL CLAYTON,

Commanding, Pine Bluff:

If General Kimball has ordered the Eighteenth Illinois to Little Rock it would be well to send it by boat. Send the cavalry up as soon as possible.

An officer of General Banks' staff leaves here in half an hour with dispatches for General Steele at Camden. He goes via Pine Bluff, and you will please furnish him with fresh horses for himself and orderly and a good cavalry escort from your command. Give them all good horses, as it is very important that he should reach Camden as soon as possible. You will be governed by your own judgment as to the number of men you furnish. Send a good officer in command, one who knows some crossing on the Saline River above or below where the train crossed if the enemy hold that place. Captain Bunner thinks 12 to 20 men a sufficient escort.

Respectfully,

W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
