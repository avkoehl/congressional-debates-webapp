up works, and give the affair the appearance of a permanent lodgment, for the purpose of co-operating with General Sherman. General Potter has but 1,300 men, and I can spare him no more. General Hatch, with 3,500 men, is north of the Combahee River. He has destroyed several miles of the railroad north of Pocotaligo, including some important trestle bridges. I will at once push him forward, as General Sherman directs, toward the Edisto River, if it be a possible thing to do so. I shall visit him to-morrow. A package of dispatches from your headquarters for General Sherman was turned over to me by General Foster to be forwarded. They are now in General Hatch's possession, who has directions to send them if it can be done with safety; otherwise their contents will be communicated verbally to two or three trusty scouts, General Hatch may not be able to spare a suitable escort for such a purpose.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff Armies of the United States, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: A dispatch* in cipher and in triplicate has been received from General Sherman's headquarters, which no one here familiar with such matters has been able to translate. I have therefore directed a steamer, which is now ready to start north, to touch at Fortress Monroe, and have the dispatch telegraphed to Lieutenant-General Grant. Admiral Dahlgren has what purports to be a key to the cipher, left with him by General Sherman, but something appears to be wanting on it, for it has not been of any use to us. I am informed that the admiral also has a cipher dispatch from General Sherman which he has not been able to translate. I respectfully request that I may be furnished with a key to the cipher used by General Sherman, with full explanations for its use.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - Since writing the above the dispatch has been deciphered and an original copy sent to General Grant and yourself by telegraph.
