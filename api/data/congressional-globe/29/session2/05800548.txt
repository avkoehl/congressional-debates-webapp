to succeed vyithout the most strenuous efforts on our part
to arrest a calamity so serious to every part of our country."
Again: in the same letter Mr. Upshur says,:
" Hut there is another view of this subject still more im-
portant to'u*5 and scarcely less important to Texas herself.
The c tabK-hment—m the very midst of our slavehoidmg
States—OS an independeritgovunmen? forbidding the exist-
ence of sJuveiy, and. by a people boin, for the toost part,
amon? us, reared up i« our habits, and speaking our lan-
guage, could not fail to produce the most unhappy effects
upoa both parties.",
In a despatch from the State Department to Mr.
Everett,our Minister in London,Mr. Upshur says:
" It is quite obvious that slavery could not easily
be maintained in a country sunounded by other
countries whose Governments did not recognise
that institution.'* And, in a despatch to Mr,
Murphy, dated January 36,1844, lie says, " that if
Texas should not be attached to the United States,
she cannot maintain that institution (slavery) ten
years, and probably not half that time."
One more extract, and I will dismiss the diplo-
matic correspondence upon this subject. On the
19th of Apiil, 1844, Mr. Calhoun, then Secretary
of State, in a despatch to Mr. Green, our charge
d'affaires in Texas, says:
" Sir: A treaty for the, annexation of Texas to the United
States has* been signed by the plenipotentiaries of the two
Governments, and v  ill be sent by the President to the Sen-
ate, without (May, for iu approval.
" In luakin&the fact known to the Mexican Government,
the President enjoin** it on jou to give it, in the first place,
the strongest assurance that, in adopting thus measure, our
Govt rrimout is actuated by uo feelings of disiespect or m-
difit?rcn< e to the honoi or dignity of Mexico, and that it
would he a subject of gioat legietifit should be otherwise
regarded by its Government. And, In the next place, that j
the ^tep wns forced on the Government of the United
States m svM-defence,in consequence oi the policy adopted
bv Gicat Bfitdin in referencv to the abolition oi' slaveiy in
Texas. It was impo^ibie foi the United States to w itnchs
witn indifference the efforts oI ftrent Butain to abolish sla-
very there. Tbey could not but see that she had the means
in her power, in" the actual condition of Texa>, to accom-
plish the objects of her policy, unlos prevented by the most
efficient mrasuics; and iliar^ if accompanied, it would load
to a state of things dangerous in the extreme to the adjacent
Slates, ami the Union itseli. Seeing this, this Government
been compelled, hy tUo necessity ot' the cas.e, and a ic-
gard to its constitutional obligations, to take the &tep it has,
as the (ii)ly certain and effectual moans or preventing it."
Who, sir, with this proof before his eyes, can
doubt the object and purpose of Texas annexa-
tion ? No one, I apprehend. Well, sir, what has
been done with this third acquisition of foreign
territory? Why, sir, it has been crcctcd into
another slave State. So that wc have admitted
into the Union live slave Stales, created out of ter-
ritory acquired since the adoption of the Consfitu- j
tion, and four out of territory ceded to us by the '
Treaty of 1783—making, now in the Union, fifteen !
slave States and fourteen free Slates! Is this, jj
sir, a condition of things anticipated or desired by j'
the patriots and statesmen of 1776 and 17tf7? No, n
sir, no—far from it. They regarded slavery as a ''
great moral and political evil; a shameful outuige jj
upon human rights, and desired to see it abolished j1
in every part of the Confederacy. |j
I will now, sir, call the attention of the Senate jj
and the country to the number of pet sons in the <\
free and slave States, the density of the popula- :i
tion, and the area in square miles of each. ji
In 1840, the thirteen slave States, and Florida, <.\
(then a territory,) and the District of Columbia, ''
had a population of 7,334,434: of this number* [!
4,848,208 were free persons, and 2,486,226 were I,
slaves. The thirteen free States with Wisconsin ;j
and Iowa, had a population of 9,728,922, which is j!
2,254,488 more than the whole population of the jj
slave Sta'es, and 4,780,714 more than the free pop- ;i
illation of the slave States. The fifteen slave !|
States now m tlie Union, including the District of jj
Columbia, have an area in square miles of 957,642. '!
The fourteen free States, and the tenitory of Wis- jj
cousin, have an area in square miles of 663,004. j!
So tiie slave States contain 297,638 squate miles of !'
territory more than the free States. The density |,
of the population in the fiee States is fourteen and jj
a fraction to a square mile: in the slave States it i<
is only s«\en and a fraction to a square mile. !
Surely the slave States ought not to call for more i;
territory. j1
But it is the avowed purpose of the Administra-.!
tion to prosecute this war until Mexico will con- !j
sent to cede to us New Mexico and Upper Cali- j>
forma. The.s§ Mexican provinces contain an area, ii
in sqaarq mika, of 57$,344. ]i
If thtsMe^can territory, which thepresident de- Ij
sires to acquire, and which his military chiefs have 1.
already annexed tq the United States, is to be open :f
to the institution of domestic slavery, we shall
have a slave territory of 1,339,986 square miles.
I will now, sir, proceed to show that slavery not
only discourages productive industry of every kind,
but that it greatly retards the settlement of a Stale*
by preventing the emigration of whites.
This position I shall attempt to sustain by com-
paring the population and productive industry of
some of the free States with the population and
productive industry of some of the slave States
I will begin with Oliio and Kentucky,
1st. Ohio came into the Union in 1803, and has
now an area, in square miles, of 44,000, and had a
population, in J84U, of 1,516,467: 34k to a square
mile. Her annual products of industiy are $63,-
906,678.
Kentucky came into the Union in 1792, and has
an area, in square miles, of 40,000; and had a popu-
lation, in 1840, of 779,828: 19| to a square mile.
Annual products of industry, $38,624,193.
Ohio, young as she is, has a larger population
than Kentucky, by 739,639; and a larger annual
product of industry by ^25,282,487.
2d. Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Virginia has an area, in square miles, of 70,000,
and in 1840 had a population of 1,239,779: which
is 171 to a square mile. Her annual products of
industry are $76,769,053.
Pennsylvania has an area, in square miles, of
46,000, and had a population in 1840, of 1,724,033:
which is 37^ to a square mile. Her annual pro-
ducts of industry are $131,033,655.
Virginia, with an area, in square miles, of 24-
000 more than Pennsylvania, has a less population
by 484.254; and her annual products of industry
are $54,264,602 loss than the annual products of
industry in Pennsylvania.
3d. Massachusetts and South Carolina.
Ma&sachissctts has an area, in square miles, of
7,800; and had, in 1840, a population of 737,699:
98 to a square mile. Annual products of industry,
$75.470,297.
South Carolina has an area, in square miles,
of 33,000; and had, in 1840, a population of
594,338: 18 to a square mile. Of this population,
327,038 are slaves. Annual products of industry,
f,27,173.536.
Massachusetts, with a territory not one-fourth
as large as South Carolina, has a larger popula-
tion by 143,248: and her annual products of indus-
try are #48,296,761 rnore than the annual products
of South Carolina.
Vermont has an area, in square miles, of 8,000;
and, in 1840, had a population of 291,218: 36} to
asquaic mile: and her annual products of indus-
try are $25,143,191. South Carolina, with a ter-
ritory moic than four times as lar°e as Vermont,
has a less free population by 23,858, and exceeds
Vermont, in annual products of industry, only
about >2,000,000.
I have proceeded far enough, by way of com-
parison, to show that the free States, with no ad-
vantage in foil or climate, have far outstripped the i
slave Stales in population and annual products of j
industry, and [ know of no cause to which it can j
be attributed but slavery. j
The slave has no stimulus to industry, because
he has no hope of bettering his condition. He is
doomed to perpetual bondage, and his children
after lmn. Hie effect of oppression and ignorance
will always be to destroy the springs of industry, I
and consequently to diminish the annual products j
of the country. The degraded and oppre&sed con- j
dition of the slave renders his labor much less i
productive than the labor of the intelligent free- !
man.
The slave labors from compulsion, and to enrich j
his master; the freeman voluntarily, and to enrich j
himself. The slave has no home to enjoy, no j
family that he can call his own to love and protect,
no country to shield him from cruelty and oppres- |
sion. He is the property of his master—subject, I
at ali times, to be restrained of his liberty, and i
chastised m his body. What inducement, I ask, !
can the slave have to rendei his labor productive?
None whatever.
Slavery, sir, is not only an element of weakness,
in the Government, but it is an element of danger
—of appalling danger. Three millionaof oppress-
ed,, degraded human beings, in the. tnidM of tha
country, deprived of all political rights*.held
as mere property, cannot but wea.l5.ea the powei*
and ejftcrency 0£ the. Government, to defend and 1
protect itself fa;om foreign aggre&mn an4 invasion.
What,sir, if Great Britain should wage war against
us, invade the southern States, and arm the slaves
against their masters? Who, then, would escape
their vengeance? Sir, the scencs of blood and
slaughter that would follow are too appalling to
dwell upon—nor age, nor sex, nor condition, would
furnish the least security against their brutal fero-
city. Yet, sir, if we should be so fortunate as to
escape the horrors of a foreign war, is there not
danger to be apprehended from the rapid increase
of the slaves. We have now nearly three millions,
and twenty-five years hence we shall have six
millions, and fifty yeais hence twelve millions.
Now, sir, may they not, at some time or other,
1 and in some way or other, learn their numbers and
their strength, and write their title to. liberty m.
characters of blood and fire. Sir, I tremble for
my country when I think of the judgments that
must be in store for us for the sin of slavery.
One word more, sir, upon the inequality of slave
representation.
The free States, with a white population of
9,485,493, are entitled to 135 Representatives in
Congress; that is, for each Representative 70,262
of the white population.
The slave States are entitled to 88 Representa-
tives in Congress, with a white population of only
4,573.546, which gives a Representative to every
51,464: so that 51,464 free persons in a slave Slate
have as much political power on the floor of Con-
gress as 70,262 white persons in a free State; that
is, it takes in the slave States 18,798 less than in
the free States to send a Representative to Con-
gress. South Carolina, with a free population of
nearly 24,000 less than Vermont, sends seven Rep-
resentatives on the floor of the other House, while
Vermont sends but four.
But when we compaie South Carolina with Npw
York, the inequality will more clearly appear.
South Carolina, at a ratio of 70,680 free mhabi-
tantants for one Representative—with, according
to the last census, a free population of 267,360,
and a slave population of 327,308—sends to the
House of Representatives seven members; where-
as, with a population of 2,428,921 free inhabitants,
New York is represented by only thirty-four mem-
bers. Hence it appears, that while 71,438 inhab-
itants of New York are entitled to one member
only, in South Carolina 38,194 elect a member. It
was supposed, when the Constitution was formed,
that New York and the other free States received
some consideration for yielding to South Carolina
and other southern States a slave representation,
in the consent of those States to be taxed, in any
system of direct taxation which might be adopted",
in proportion to their representation. This con-
sideration, however, has entirely failed. The pub-
lic debt has been paid, and the expenditures of the
Government have been defrayed, without a resort
to direct taxation, except at three short intervals,
and it is quite certain, if the settled policy of the
Government for the last thirty years be not aban-
doned, that it will not again be resorted to as a
means of supporting the Government. Sir, Ver-
mont cannot consent to the acquisition of foreign
territory, to be created into new slave States to be
represented upon this unequal basis.
But, sir, we have territory enough—more than
we can occupy for two centuries to come.
The United States now have an area of 2,620,000
square miles, with a population of only 8) to a
square mile. If the population in the United "States
were as dense as it is in Massachussetts, (98 to a
square mile,) we should have 260.000,000 of souls;,
and if as dense as it is in England, (293£ to a square
mile,) we should have 767,970.000 of souls.
Sir, what more do we need. We are in posses-
sion of the richest inheritance that ever fell to the
lot of man. We have in our own bosom all the
elements of greatness; and, under the direction of
wise and discreet counsels, we are destined to a
career of glory more brilliant than history has re-
corded of any other nation on the face of the earth.
Let us, then, be contented, and thank God for the
manifold blessings we enjoy. Sir, [ have done. I
know I, have been guilty of an act of great indis-
cretion in attempting, in my feeble state of health,
to address the Senate at this late hour of the night.
But, sir, I could not well ayoid it, after the remarks
I of the honorable Senator from South Carolina,
j [Mr. Butler.]
I Mr. CASS said:
j Mr, President: The subject before us Is the
1 appropriation of Uuefe millions of dolkre, to enable
