at Paint Rock, Larkinsville, &amp;c., and to scout well thereabouts to find Lyon, and destroy him, if possible. Please telegraph your approval of this act. I have also directed General Granger to send part of the brigade I sent him up the river, and for Captain Forrest, of the gun-boat, to patrol down the river from Bridgeport, to prevent the enemy from crossing.

Brigadier-general WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

No order has been received assigning the Third and Fourth Michigan to this corps. Where are these regiments?

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, Tenn., January 7, 11865.

Brigadier General T. J. WOOD,Huntsville:

The Third and Fourth Michigan were assigned to your corps some time since. The regiment in charge of the pontoon train still belongs to you, and the train is intended for your corps, and of course you should furnish a regiment to take charge of it. There are no other regiments which can possibly be assigned to you.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, Tenn., January 7, 1865.

Brigadier General T. J. WOOD,Huntsville:

Your men are being sent from hospital to their commands as rapidly as possible. The War Department has ordered boards of inspectors and special inspectors for the purpose of examining the inmates of hospitals, with a view to sending to the field all fit for duty; and any further attempts to accomplish the same end on the part of the Department of the Cumberland only makes trouble. If you would call for them individually, and state where they are, the work of collecting them would be somewhat facilitated.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General.
