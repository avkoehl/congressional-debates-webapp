Before our agent left, however, on Monday, when it was know, gold advanced from 500 of 600 percent. It had been selling before at 2100, and was sold on Monday at 2600 and 2700.

In regard to some information lately asked for by Lieutenant-Colonel Comstock, I get the following answers: The enemy are abundantly supplied with spherical case. There is a great scarcity of Parrot shell of all sizes, particularly for the 20-ponders. The caps now made are very bad, the sheet copper belonging to the Government being entirely consumed, and the Government has agents picking up copper wherever it may be found. There is also a great dearth of soft iron, so much so that it is said that no more is to be had for the manufacture of heavy ammunition. The enemy are now understood to have four Whitworth guns with General Lee's army, an fixed ammunition for them is in great demand.

I inclose a Richmond paper of the 5th, whose articles show in wait a bitter spirit the fall of Atlanta is Received. It is the only one brought.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
