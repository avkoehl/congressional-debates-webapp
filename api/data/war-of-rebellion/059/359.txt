Brigadier-General HOBSON:

Colonel Gallup telegraphs that he was attacked yesterday at Paintsville, by about 1,000 rebels; his force is 750, and having secured a good position he would hold it. Direct the force now at West Liberty to move rapidly on the Salyersville road toward Pound Gap co-operate with Gallup at Paintsville; by this means we may get their rear. Order the Eleventh Michigan to move with all possible speed and by nearest route to support the force moving from West Liberty.

If it can be done the Eleventh Michigan should join that force; if not, it can move in supporting distance. Hold balance of your command ready to move in any direction. Inform General Stoneman of this dispatch, and procure his consent to use the detachment of First Kentucky now at West Liberty.

By order of General Burbridge:
