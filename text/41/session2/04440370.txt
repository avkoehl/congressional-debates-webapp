SPEECH OF HON7 T W. FERRY,
or michigan,
In the House of Representatives,
May 24, 1870,
On the folly of reciprocity.
Mr. FERRY. Mr. Speaker, the singular
and summary manner in which the tariff bill
was set aside implies its appearance in some
other form with essential modifications. We
had just reached in its consideration, in Com-
mittee of the Whole, the article of lumber. In
the general debate upon the bill several speeches
were made against the duty upon lumber, and
scarcely any in its favor, the friends of the
measure preferring to meet the question in
special debate. It was my intention to express
my views upon the subject when so considered
under the five-minutes rule. The supersedure
of the bill by appropriation bills has cut off
opportunity to present the reasons why the
existing duty upon this article should be con-
tinued. It is now implied that an attempt will
be made to put lumber upon the free list, under
the spur of the previous question, which will
prevent any amendment or expression against
it. I am unwilling, therefore, that silence
should be construed as concession to such folly
and injustice. In behalf of those who insist
upon a prudent and equitable discrimination of
duties that shall, in raising a proper revenue,
fairly protect to that extent the various indus-
tries of the land, I desire to invite the attention
of the Committee of Ways and Means and the
House to the injustice of removal and the jus-
tice of continuing in force the present duty
upon lumber. If facts and reasons which I
may present convince {lie judgment, then may
L not ask the House to thwart any such unwise
attempt as has already been intimated?
Mr. Speaker, I am forced to express surprise
at the attitude of honorable Representatives
of agricultural districts upon the question of
duty upon lumber. Representing lumbering
districts, it has been our pleasure to join in
raising the duty upon agricultural products,
and wo voted to increase that duty 50 per cent,
abovo existing rates. The bill proposed a re-
duction of 30 per cent, of the duty upon lum-
ber by changing the existing ad valorem duty
of 20 per cent, to a specilio duty of $2 per
thousand feet. Not content with thus favoring
cereals over lumber 80 pcr cent, more than the
present tariff on these productions, the com-
mittee were importuned by these gentlemen to
not only cut down still lower upon lumber, but
even to place it upon the "free list." Why
such disparity ?
The importation of wheat from Canada the
past year was only 2 per cent, upon the aggre-
gate production in the United States. The
importation of provincial lumber was 5 per
cent, upon the aggregate product in the States,
being more than double the ratio of wheat;
and yet we were persuaded to add largely to
the duty upon grains, and besieged to reduce
largely, if not wholly, the duty upon lumber.
The pretext is "cheap lumber for the people."
More bread is eaten than lumber consumed.
I warn the gentlemen that free duty for lum-
ber may exact free duty upon wheat. The
clamor raised for " free trade"' upon this arti-
cle may not bido the limits of the notions of
those partial theorists, but sweep away in the
tide every vestige of protection, and call down
upon their heads the fatal mutter of the peo-
ple's indignation.
These advocates of repeal base their opinions
upon the statement that the duty increases the
price of lumber in both Canada and the States,
and the increase is paid by the consumer. I
accept the fact stated by them, that the price
in Canada has increased during the past few
years, and since the expiration of the reci-
procity treaty. As readily should they accept
the other 'act, not gainsaid by them, that the
price in the States has decreased within that
time. What, then, are the reasons for this
undeniable contrariety of facts? The import-
ation of lumber from Canada necessarily in-
volves the increase of cost directly to the pro-
ducer in precisely the amount of the duty levied
upon his product, and to that extent augment-
ing its value to him, whatever may be the price
it brings in our markets. In the end either the
producer pays it out of his profits in the manu-
facture, or the consumer meets it as so much
burden upon its consumption. I am now
speaking of provincial lumber which seeks a
market within our borders. Whatever other
markets influence the price of Canadian lum-
ber, has no bearing upon the question under
discussion, for that lies beyond our control,
and cannot be affected by any policy that we
may shape for making lumber cheaper than it
now sells for in our markets. To make this
more clear, I may state, that if the United
States were the controlling market of Cana-
dian lumber, most of it would come to us
instead of going to distant foreign ports for
profitable sale. The highest price controls the
market of any commodity. It is a fact that but
a small portion of the product of the provinces
comes to our market. Reference to the im-
portations will show how uniform that annual
amount has been, and proves, what is implied,
that the most of what lumber reaches us is of
such lower grades as will not bear transport-
ation to other markets. I give the importations
for the past four years, showing this remark-
able uniformity:
Feet.
In 1866 wc received 500,500,00!)
In 1867 wo received 555,500,0111)
In 1868 wc roceived 524,500,000
In 1869 wo received 550,000,000
If prices increased annually in the States
it would naturally follow that the quantity im-
ported would largely increase, for if the theory
of the advocates of repeal be correct, the import
duty would become a charge upon and be paid
by the consumer, rather than the producer, and
thus the American purchaser would be forced
to pay just what the Canadian seller demanded
for his lumber, duty added. The quantity sold
us, not substantially increasing, so far proves
that they bear the burden of the duty rather
than Americans.
Let me now turn to the quantity manufactured
in the States, and the market prices.
I quote first from the Albany Kvening Jour-
nal to show the prices in the Albany market of
the upper qualities, as that is the kind mostly
sought for eastern consumption:

September 1,1869.... 55® 58 20® 22 133 29 83
These prices are given from 1802 to I860,
during reciprocity, and those from 1860 to 1809,
since the duty has been imposed. That of §20
in 1802, reaching S3G 09 in 18G0, shows an in-
creaseof$lG 09 per thousand. Since that time
there has been a gradual decrease to$29 88 in
1809, being a diminution of $5 22 per thousand.
I now quote the Chicago market, the largest,
one for lumber in the world, and read from a
certified statement, made up of monthly sales
into annual average, by the president of the
Chicago Lumbermen's Exchange:
