Report of Captain Charles Semple, Ordnance Officer.

ORDNANCE OFFICE, BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION, Camp before Chattanooga, October 11, 1863.

GENERAL: In compliance with circular order from the headquarters of the Army of Tennessee, October 6, I have the honor to report that the ammunition made at the several arsenals of the Confederate States for the Enfield rifle, caliber 57, could, in my humble opinion, be much improved by having the ball made sufficiently small to allow the lubrication on the outside of the cartridge, after the manner of the English cartridge. This would greatly facilitate the men in loading, and would prevent the leading of the arm, which now on all occasions of action happens. In this division there were nineteen instances of this particular arm becoming choked and unfit for use, from cause above mentioned, which came immediately under my notice, but there were several other cases of the same kind reported to me after the battle of the 20th ultimo. In al cases where I had issued the English cartridge [some of which I have got on hand] no such consequences were reported to me, nor have I ever heard of a single instance during my experience as ordnance officer, nearly eighteen months.

I have also to report the complaint of the battery commanders of this division of the friction primers made at our arsenals, which they report as perfectly worthless and unreliable.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

CHARLES SEMPLE,

Captain, and Ordnance Officer, Breckinridge's Division.

Brigadier-General MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
