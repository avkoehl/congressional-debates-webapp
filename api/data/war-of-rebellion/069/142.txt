GILLMORE'S, May 23, 1864.

Major DAVIS:

The tri-monthly return of the Tenth Corps, due on the 20th, will be sent in to-day. The delay was in consequence of division returns having to be returned for correction of errors traceable to the almost incessant labor to which officers and men have been subjected recently by the frequent movement to the command.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-general.

GILLMORE'S, May 23, 1864-9.5 p. m.

General BUTLER:

Major Trumbell, First Connecticut Artillery, reports that from a lookout on tree on our line, no guns can be seen on the battery on our left with opened on us at 11 to-day, neither are there any troops but picket to be seen-no tents. No work going on as far along their line as the open space in our front extends.

GILLMORE,

General.

GILLMORE'S, May 23, 1864-10.04 p. m.
