Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Smyth, commanding brigade of Hays' division, in making his demonstration, captured the intrenched picket-lie of the enemy near Hatcher's Run and about 100 prisoners. The enemy has several times attacked McAllister's new picket-line and has succeeded in recapturing some of the pits take by General McAllister. He is now about attacking them again. They keep up the fire on Miles, but [not] with the vigor of heretofore. Mott's left has constantly opened on them.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-7 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

The enemy attacked, but has been repulsed. We captured the battle-flags of the Forty-third and Sixth-ninth Alabama. One hundred and six men and four officers have already come in. I find that Gracie's and Wise's brigades have been here all day, and that Cooke's brigade returned about one hour ago. Many of the prisoners report Johnson's division here and a large part of Hill's corps. I will withdrawn when I can properly do so. Over 400 prisoners are already reported.
