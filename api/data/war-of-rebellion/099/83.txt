IV. The necessities of the service require that the negroes employed in the engineer, commissary, and quartermaster's departments of this army should not be molested by recruiting parties for colored organizations. Recruiting parties are, therefore, expressly prohibited from recruiting any such employee in this Army. If taken in violation of these orders he will be reclaimed, and the person recruiting him arrested and dealt with accordingly. To prevent mistakes officers employing negroes will furnish them with certificates showing by who and how employed.
