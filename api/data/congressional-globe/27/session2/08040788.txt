amg, here would be danger of the bill for "as reduc-
tion of the array being put aside for the session.
Some conversation ensued between Messrs C.
JOHNSON and STANLY, the latter gentleman
assurmg the gentleman from Tennessee that tie
bill for the oigamzation of t^e army vouid be
pressed during the present ses3nn.
Mr. WARD urged the immediate pa'S'ge of
the army bill, on the ground that much it-conveni-
ence was «u Uised by the inabü ly to pay the
claimants on the Government in this department
If there was a majority of thu House in favor of
reducing the army, thev could do it as effectually
byjije bill for the reorganization ot the army, a«
b"\he appropna'ion bill, but in relation to the
cngoons, which tac Senate had resiored, he re-
marked that the vote by which the legiment of
dragoons was reduced was earned by a majorny
of erne on!), and many gentlemen, since that tire,
aad changed their opinion on the subject
Mi GRAHAM opposed the amendment of the
8enat , and wiá he was in favor of the b'M as it
massed the House; and he hoped the Hmse wonld
net cencur 11 the amendment of the Sena'e He
kr v- that gentlemen on both sides th<" Hoase were
i, jp mon hat this was not the proper bill by
wh e ' make a reduction, but he knew also that
ib  3e iátary of War was opposed to a reduction of
th' ■s ffiy, an ' the same opponü< n to a reduction
exwiea in otccr quarters, and he deemed it desira.
h'e, thereto e, that the House should not recede
from  the po i ion which 11 had taken
Mr. ADA^S was understood to contend that
the bi'l for the re-organization of the army should
have been brought forward before this bill was
pushed through the forms of legislation. If the bill
were passed as it had come back to ther  from the
Senate, and the bill for the re-organization of the
army were not acted upon, he asked «here the
«noney to pai t«e.soldiers was to come from Ha
piefe-red d bird m the hand to one in the bu«h, and
therefore he was, opposed to the amendment of the
Senate The treasury was now emptv, and the
leven je v inch the President was now coliee v g,
be was collecting sithrut any anmonty oí Jaw
It wis the spme course as that which was pureed
by Charles Í, and how did that end' Tne block
on which Charles's head fell wou'd it Ü bow it
ended
He then commented on the many attempts made
in this House to introduce measu *,s to remedy the
disorder now exiting, particularly on the expos'
facto law of Mr Barnard, and the opinion of the
law officer of the Government by which the Prc-i
dent wfc su.tamed, and concluded that not one la v
yer v>as found in the House tu justify, by regal aa-
thoruy, the ' levyirg of ship-money," to which the
President had had recourse
Mr. EVERETT also took part in th  debate
Mr. HOLMSS then obtained the floor, but yield-
ed it temporarily to
Mr GILMER, who replied to the remar' s made
in relation n himself by the gentleman from Ver-
mont, [Mr  Everett,] who spoke of his, vie? s as
being of more than usual importance, on account
of the relations he bore towards the President.   It
■was true that he had deprecated the discussion of a
treaiy about whit h nothing was known    He had
expressed the hope that those gentlemen who a>. first
voted far a reduction of the army would  not be
'i iven iron their position by any apprehensions in
relation to the treaty said to have beea concluded.
He did not know that the rumors were true, a-d
had heard no more than wha   had come to the
knowledge of every member of the House    What
V said was, that, if toe ruriors afloat could form
■ iy basis for action, or for the formation  of an
opmiou, the matter would first hare to cone before
the Senate     If the treaty was such as rumor rep-
r ""1'cd it to be, he did not doubt tha' it would fail
¡o  receive tV s?nction of the consti'utional boiy
Fa" those reason^, hr d"precatert eny discussion of
a "-eaty, the terns-! of which could not be known to
'he House, wi'hout a breach of confidence
As to the consequence given to his views by the
gpntleman from Veimont, [Mr Everett,] on   ac-
count of hn relations to the Pre^d^nt, he would   j
sa  that he did rot know what the gentleman un-   I
der^tood by his relations to the President     Those ¡j

Mr. HOL WES said tnere was eviden"y some-

cerned in it* ratification, he krew not He eouM

from Massachusetts [\ir Adams] had, he thou get,

That gentleman had ú'gned that, ?s ihcie wm
t ochiüg in the treasury, and no ¡aw to put any-
th ng in it, therefore tne army should be reduced. I
the argument had fore in it, then the wbo'e army
should be redac d and tne gownmen* stopped
He replied to the remark ot the gentleman from
Massaehusstts, fciat the President bid better take
care how he raised sli p money, lest he should be
b'ought to the block, as was the fate of one of the
monarchs of Europe He woul i spy u,at, if the
