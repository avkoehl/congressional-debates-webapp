near the church, three miles out, he discovered a cavalry picket in the road, when he deployed his men and advanced. He soon discovered a force of about sixty men with two mountain howitzers, when he halted and sent back for re-enforcements to the hospital. When they arrived, twenty-seven in mumber, he deployed and advanced. The right of the line fired and dismounted one man, and the force retreated rapidly. He then advanced with his won guard and train about three miles, when he met the Sixth Missouri Cavalry, who proceeded after the enemy in the direction they retreated. He also learned that this was the same force that captured several ambulances the day previous. He remained last night at Port Gibson and meant with no further dificulty. I consider Lieutenant McElrea entired to great credit for bringing his train through safely with so small a force.

Very respectfully,

GEO. B. BOOMER,
