QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Richmond, December 22, 1863.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

On the 14th of this month a requisition for a supply of clothing for General Longstreet's command was received at this office. The depot officers were directed to forward the articles called for as promptly as possible. The requisition called for 10,000 blankets, a large number in proportion to the command. Three thousand five hundred, all on hand, were ordered to be issued and others will be sent forward when they are received from Wilmington.
