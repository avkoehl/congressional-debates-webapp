RICHMOND, November 14, 1861.

Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

Out of about 9,000 rifles, I have assigned half to General Lee's command and the other half to General A. S. Johnston's command. General Lee will therefore have 4,500, which, when added to the 1,100 brought in for Georgia, makes 5,600 arms for the defense of Charleston and Savannah. As soon as I get the account of the cannot on board I will appropriate to the same purpose every piece that I can fairly assign to your coast. I shall know in a day or two what is possible.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, November 14, 1861.

J. P. BENJAMIN:

I have just learned that the small-arms, &amp;c., on the Fingal are the property of the Confederate Government. General Lee is now here, and has made requisition on me for five regiments. I have the men ready, but no arms. Will you send me an order for them? You know their situation, and will surely help us in ammunition.

F. W. PICKENS.

RICHMOND, November 14, 1861.

Governor PICKENS,

Charleston, S. C.:

I have assigned to General Lee 4,500 of the the arms received by the Fingal, being half of all that are for us. The State of Georgia has also 1,100 on board, so that General Lee will have 5,600 for arming his department.
