ATLANTA, October 31, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch received. It will take more than one-half the available cars between here and Chattanooga to move the Twenty- THIRD Corps. The removal of stores to the rear will have to stop in a great measures. The railroad has been open but two days. Much has been done, but there is still more to do than can be done in seven days, with the usual rate of accidents. If the Twenty-THIRD Corps move by cars it will take eleven days to complete everything. We still require some hundreds of cars of stores to complete your supplies and outfit. Under the circumstances, shall cars be sent at once to move the Twenty-THIRD Corps? Answer.

Your telegram received. All must move in four of five days. What supplies can't be got we must do without, and what material can't be moved will be destroyed. Cars should be sent Genera Schofield from the north. Will draw clothing at Atlanta.

General EASTON, Atlanta, Ga.:

It is important that you give all force possible to the preparations for the move as directed, as it may be that we depart before you can complete them, even with the greatest haste. The general desires great activity both from you and Colonel Beckwith.

General Thompson, in Tennessee, will want those troops as soon as possible. Winslow's cavalry will be also needed at Memphis far more than in Missouri, where guerrillas should be looked after by the people them-
