Numbers 3. Reports of Major General U. S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding Army of the Tennessee, with abstracts from the field returns of the several divisions, April 4-5 April 10-15, 1862.

PITTSBURG, April 7, 1862.

Yesterday the rebels attacked us here with an overwhelming force, driving our troops in from their advanced position to near the Landing. General Wallace was immediately ordered up from Crump's Landing, and in the evening one division of General Buell's army and General Buel in person arrived. During the night one other division arrived, and still another t-day. This morning, at the break of the day, I ordered an attack, which resulted in a fight which continued until late this afternoon, with severe loss on both sides, but a complete repulse of the enemy. I shall follow to-morrow far enough to see that no immediate renewal of an attack is contemplated.
