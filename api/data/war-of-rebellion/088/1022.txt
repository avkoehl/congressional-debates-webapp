Major-General WARREN:

I ordered Ferrero to move his brigade at the Gurley House over to the front line, and I see it is now on its way. Not hearing from you about the garrison, I fear he may moved without waiting for it. The brigade commanders may have been notified by the commandant of the garrison.
