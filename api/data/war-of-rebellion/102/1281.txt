HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., April 15, 1865.

Major General J. F. FAGAN,

Commanding District of Arkansas, Camden:

It is not my intention that infantry should form part of Your expedition. Success must be consequent upon surprise and rapid movement. We have not the means of transporting supplies or prosecuting the siege. My idea was I would support You with infantry after You had taken the place. If You are successful and find abundance of supplies, the infantry would march rapidly up and occupy the works. With this purpose I intended, about the time Your expedition started, moving a division of infantry near Camden, where they could be within short communication of You by courier.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
