express opinions on this subject, but thefuends
of ilie State and National Ad ninistrations have
lecently had meetings in nearly every town, to
elect delegates for then Counc I and Senatorial
District Conventions for the present year No
orgaiiU"d opposition has yet appeared to the pie
vailing paity, nor is there a probability that there
will be any opposition Yet nevei have the pn
raary meetings been as full, or the conventions
been so generally attended More than two hun-
dred of the two hundred and thirty eight towns,
in each convention, nave been represented Ihe
delegates, in some instances, travelled a distance
of seventy miles to attend them And it is the
interesting position of the country m relation to
the Bank of the United States that thus called out
these full conventions Without any previous
conceit the five council district conventions and
eleven of the twelve senatorial conventions have
passed strong íesolutions against «chartering the
bank, and entirely ¿ippioving the removal of the
deposites The conventions have not gent their
resolutions here, but they have published them to
the world
At least three to one of the people of New
Hampshue are opposed to this bank, and was it
not that the question is identified with the two
parties—the old Federal and Democratic parties—
theie v/ould be none but the debtors and immediate
dependants of the bank favorable to a renewal of
its charter
The retaining the bills of the Commercial Bank,
which is the deposite bank, by the bank at Ports
mouth, is proof conclusive of" the predetermined
hostility of the branch bank to the State banks that
will not obey its commands The manner of re-
deeming the notes of the interior banks m New
England has become a system, bringing all to a
par value B ston being the emporium to whicn

because the managers of that bank know that by
so doing they can pounce upon the Commeical I
Bank either at one place or the other, and thus
compel the bank to provide a specie fund at both
places at the same time for this single amount of
money                                                                           |
In 1832 I was surprised to find petitions coming
in herefiom banksm New Hampshire, favoiab'e
to renewing the charter of the Bank of the United
States Those banks, generally, had had veiy
little to do with the United States Bank, they
never had been in a position to ask favors horn it,
or to be much affected in business by it Ihe
banks in New Hampshire are generally in the
hands of our political opponents
Aftet my return hone I was made acquainted
with the procesb of procunngthesepetitions The
bank attorney at the head of the branch at Ports-
mouth Was the agent to write to some pohucal
friend connected with each bank, urging that peti-
tions might beforwaided In some instances the
directors of these banks having before then eyes
the declaration of Mr Biddle in 1830, that it was
m the power of his bank, at almost any time, to
annihilate the State banks, obeyed the command
In other cases, after a waim controversy,a major-
ity of the duectors vote! the proposi ion down 
And m some few cases, no attention was paid to
the call
I ha\e information fiom vanous parts of New
England that callsfrom the South have been there
made to get up agitation meetings on the subject
of the deposites But little impre-sion as yet has
been made out of thecommeicial towns, for theie
is an innate hostility to the United Siates B-mk and
Us management throughout the whole interior of
New Ei gland The Massachusetts Legis ature,
opposed as it is to General Jackson and the Ad
mims.tr xtion.h-ia disobeyed the instructions which
have been seat to B)ston,and manifested the wise
determination of not molesting the deposite banks

effort on the State of New Hampshire thus for,
has re ulted in obtaining in a single town about
one half of the party in opposition to the Admin
oration to put their names to a somewhat equiv-
ocal request that the deposites may be restored
Mi BELL said it would be inexcusable in I m
to answer all the lemarks of the gentlema i But
little of what he had said was applicable to the
subject But his observations m relation to the
character of the signers of the memorial iequired
a few words in íeply from him He knew many
of the memorialists, and he v/ould under ake to
affirm that they composed a very consideraole por
tion of the merchants and business men of the city
of Poitsmouth It was signed by the presidents,
cashiers, and principal cleiks in the five banks in
that place True, the memorial was not la-ge,
and probably contained no more names than 1 ad
been mentioned As to the misconduct of the
branch bank at Portsmouth, he knew no'lnng It
might be that i' had acted improperly But the
opinion there was, that in its general opeiations it
had acted with great propriety, and had extended
its accommodations to gentlemen of all political
pantes, and some of the directors were friends of
the present Administration
Mr KNIGHT presented the memorial of sun-
dry citizens of Providence, Rhode Island, ascrib-
ing the distress of the mercantile community to
the removal of the deposites, and asking their res-
toration to the Bank of the United States
On presenting the memorial, Mr K addressed
the Senate for a few minutes, and was followed
by Mr ROBBINS at some length
The memorial was then refeired to the Commit
tee on Tinanee, and ordered to be printed
Mr WILKINS moved the special order of the
day, but gave way to

The Senate then proceeded to the remaining
ordei, being Mi   Clay's, ¡esolution upon
THE REMOVAL OI  THE DEPOSITES
The special Older of the day,being Mr Cut's
resolution relative to tne removal oí thedeposi'es,
coming up for consideration-
Mr   WILKINS Lose and said he hoped he
would  not be accused of affectation when he de
clared that he felt great apprehension and embar
íassment in  proceeding m a debate which hao
already occupied two months     As he intimated
befoie, however, lie felt it to be his duty, and he
hoped the Senate would bear with him     de could
neitl er promise brevity or e\pect to have infiu
ence    The dictates of his own conscience and the
rectitude of his intentions were his own justifica-
tion
The resolution of the gentleman from Kentucky,
and the repoa of the Committee on i manee upon
that resolution, and the memm ai of the Bank of
the United States, all admit that the removal of
the deposi es was effected by ihe Secretary of the
Ireasu-y himself The resolution tacitly admits
the unqual fied power of the Secretary over the
deposites, and the leport of the Committee on Fi-
nance pdmits 1 is power and control, but assumes
that it should on'y be exeicised on important
occasions, and that no emergency had happened
which ¡ust fied it and they both admit the power
of theSe le'ary to be contained in the 16th section
of thechaitet After these admissions he could
not but be surpiised that in the memorials pre-
sented, and in the a guments of gentlemen here,
the power was still denied The second res
olution charges no assumption of unconstitutional
Dower on the Secietary,but fainy tenders thetiue
issue Was the removal of the deposites justified
as a measure of public expediency > or,m*the lan-
guage of tne chaiter, are the reasons sufficient and
satisfactory ? Believing that this was the proper
issue, he was unwilling to listen to any change of
it, and hence he voted against the amendment of
his friend from Missouri, [Mr Ben ton ] Take
up the lGth section of the charter as connected
with the removal of the deposites, and there are
thiee positions piesemed the power unrestricted
and absolute in the Secretaiy, the manner of exe-
cuting it, and the propriety and sufficiency of the
reasons for the act To show the unrestricted
power of the Secretaiy, he observed that the 16th
section was divided into two parts The firstgives
the absolute power in any emergency to place the
public money in the Bank of the United States, or
anywhere e'se he may deem proper Now, this
section gives the power and limits it, i it can be
called limiting it, to placing the money there,
unless otheiwise ordered The second paragraph
reqaires hin to give his reasons There is heie
no qualification of authority or diminution of it in
any way, but it says you may exercise it as you
p'ease, only let Congress know how you have
exercised it, so vhat they may know whether any
further legislation is necessary on the subject It
seemed difficult to ascertain how the 16th section
found its way into the bill He had tiaced it up,
and discovered that it was offered asan amendment
by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts,
[Mi Webster,] then a distinguished member of
the House of Representatives If he—Mr WiL-
kivs—might be allowed to conjecture, he had no
doubt it was intended as a benefit to the bank, but
it was a contingent one, to be enjoyed at the voli-
tion of the Secretary And he thought there was
some ground for the conjecture, that the friends
of the bank had rather the deposites should be
made there, and there continued, at the will of the
Secretary, than that they should be subject to the
will of Congress They may haie been afraid
of the operations of the local banks upon Con-
gress, when at any time the bank should become
unpopular
But whether the conjecture be correct or not, on
recurring to the histoiy of the Treasuiy Depart-
ment ample authority for theexeiciseof the power
as the Secretary has exercised it, wou'd be found
Tracing it up from the first Continental Congress,
it would be found that tne Board of Treasury, as
it was called by the ordinance of Jidy 3,1779, were
to deposite the moneys in the most proper end
safest places, and the Treasurer was to receive and
keep them and in the act of 1789 the phrase " the
Treasurer is to receive and keep" is preserved, so
I that from the tine of Robert Morris down through
all the laws on the subject, we find the control of
the Secretary over the oeposites absolute In
the act of 1791 chartering ihe first bmk, there is
notnmg said of the public deposites, but they are
left to the Secretary During the existence of the
chartei  of the old  lank it ard  the local banks
' shared in tne pi hi c oeposites, and they were
managed by the Se"ietsiy as the public interests
I requned ard when we come down to the bill sub-
mitted to Congiess by Mi Dallas in 1314, there
was no piovision m it, lea\m¡* them under the
contiol of the Secretary Nothing was intimated
on this suuject until the 16th section of the bank
I cnai er, the amendment offeied by the gentleman
alluded to, was introduced     It attracted no atten-
i tion or debate, but passed with o her amendments.
