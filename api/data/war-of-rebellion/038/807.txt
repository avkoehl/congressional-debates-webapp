Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond, Va.:

A furious battle has been going on since daylight just below Port Gibson. General Bowen reports General [E. D.] treaty killed. The Virginia Battery was captured by enemy, but retaken. Bowen says he is outnumbered trebly; he has about 8,000. Enemy can cross all his army from Hard Times to Bruinsburg, below Bayou Pierre. Large re-enforcements should be sent me from other departments. Enemy's movement threatens Jackson, and, if successful, cuts off Vicksburg and Port Hudson from the east. Am hurrying all re-enforcements I possibly can to Bowen. Enemy's success in passing our batteries has completely changed character of defense.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, [May 1,] 1863.

General PEMBERTON, Vicksburg, MISS.:

Your dispatch to the President received. Heavy re-enforcements will be sent from General Beauregard's command. Will telegraph further intelligence in the next twenty-four hours.

J. A. SEDDON.

RICHMOND, May 1, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Have telegraphed to General Johnston in reference to your want of cavalry. Am trying to get you some from Southern Alabama.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
