Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Mil. Div. of West Mississippi, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: Your telegram of the 18th instant is received. Orders from the Navy Department to proceed to New Orleans were delivered to the Manhattan on the morning of the 15th instant, and the commanding officer of the vessel which took them and returned here immediately on their delivery, reported that Lieutenant-Commander Foster said he would have the Manhattan under way by 9 a. m. of that date.

Very respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 23, 1865.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans, La.:

If you can reach Colonel Dye by telegraph to Morganza, say to him that General Canby has no instructions to give beyond those General Osterhaus was to have, and doubtless has, given him. The general officers from Johnson's Island are not included in the capitulation of Taylor's forces, and cannot, therefore, be paroled.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 23rd day of May, 1865: Lieutenant G. G. Curtiss reports from Baton Rouge under date of May 18 as follows: The soldiers belonging to rebel commands outside are fast surrendering themselves for parole. Many of them are defiant, and express themselves desirous of again entering service against the United States Government. He thinks many of them are retaining their arms and horses, contrary to the terms of surrender. Does not believe that more than one-half the commands are delivering their arms.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, t

FRANK N. WICKER,

Lieutenant Signal Corps, U. S. Army.

(In absence of Captain S. M. Eaton, chief signal officer, Military Division of West Mississippi.)
