CAPE GIRARDEAU, September 29, 1864-3 p. m.

General EWING,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Have just received report from my cavalry force west of Jackson. They report that the rebels are still in strong force toward Fredericktown, but that the small squads who were scouring the country have all gone to the main body. My cavalry force is too light to harass the enemy to any extent. I keep them out constantly watching their movements. Have had a small force at Charleston for some days. There are no rebels there now. By late reports from Bloomfield I learn that the rebels have all left there, passing up toward Fredericktown. I am very anxious to hear from the Knob. Please give me what news you have up to the present. Citizens from toward Fredericktown all report that they heard heavy firing in that direction Tuesday evening.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
