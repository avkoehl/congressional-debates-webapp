PORTLAND, ME., May 24, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

I wish to be informed whether a regiment of picked men outside of the State militia to serve during the war would be accepted and equipped by the Government? I am assured that such a regiment can be ready in ten days, and urged to procure its acceptance. They would be of the right sort.

Honorable WILLIAM PITT FESSENDEN,

Very truly, yours,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
