Your dispatch received. I think all orders have been given by McPherson which are necessary. Washburn goes to Memphis and exercises command over all the troops from Cairo down, and Slocum commands the Vicksburg district. Your remain at Cairo; Genera; Hurlbut also for the present. As soon as possible, send me the report of the officers inquiring into the Pillow affair, as I must soon go forward.

General HURLBUT, Cairo:

A dispatch to me from General Grant, at Culpeper, shows that he wishes Dodge to command that part of your corps now at and near Decatur. Therefore, remain at Cairo until we can arrange matters. Washburn will command from Cairo down below Memphis, and Slocum on down to Banks' department. Steele will command on Red River. McPherson's troops will come up the Tennessee and join him at Hunstville, unless it turns out that Forrest is still above Memphis.

Major-General HURLBUT, Cairo:

GENERAL: I have your letter of April 18. My dispatch to you is not vague, but very clear.

The fact that Forrest's and Chalmer's forces, as well as that of McCulloch, passed by the flank within 50 miles of Memphis unattacked does show timidity somewhere. I didn't fix it in my dispatch to you. My dispatch was based on one from General Grant, since which time I have received the printed Orders, Numbers 150, which are explicit enough. I believe you had at Memphis force enough to have insured the safety of the place and left at least 4,000 infantry and as much cavalry with which to have attacked Forrest in flank going north or returning south.

I did intend to have you come to command your corps here, but orders from headquarters are that you report by letter to the Adjutant-General from Cairo.

I am, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
