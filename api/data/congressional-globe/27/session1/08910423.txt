perceive the importance of no lomr-j ieavms¡he Government
of the Unite 1 state uniformed of it-* vjews ind intentions upon
a subject winch has naturally produced much exasperation,and
which has led to ^uch grave consequences
"The communication of the fact that the destruction of the
'Caroline' was an act of public force, by tbe British authon
ties, heme formally made to the Government of the United
•States by Mr Fox's note, the case assumes a decided aspect.
"lhe Government of the United States entertain  no doubt
that after this avowal of the transaction as a public transaction,
authorized and undertaken by the British authorities, rndm
duals concemedm it ought not, by the principles of public law
and the general usage of civilized States, to be holden personally
responsible, in the ordinary tribunals ol law, for their participa
Hon in it And the President presumes that it can hardly be
necessarv to say that the American people, not distrustful of
their ability to redress public wrongs by public means, cannot
desne the punishment of individuals, when the act com-
plained of is tleclared to have been an act of Government
itself
"Soon after the date of Mr Fox's notef an instruction was
given to the Attorney Geneial of the United States, from ibis
Depai tntent by drr ection of the President, w hich fully sets lorth
theopmrons oí this Government on the subject of McLeod'sim
pn&onment, a copy of which instruction the undersigned has
the honor nine with to enclose
' The indictment against McLeod is pending in a State court;
but his rights, whatever they may be, are nu Jess safe, it is to bo
presumed, than if he weie holden to answer in one of the courts
of this Government
"He demands immunity from personal lesponsibihty by vir-
tue of the law of nations, and that law, m civilized States, 19 io
be respected in all courts None is either so high or so low as
to escape from its authority in cases to which its rules and
principles apply
' TI11& Depaument has been regularly informed by his excel-
lency the Governor of the State of New York that the Chief
Justice of that State was assigned to preside at the hearing and
trial of McLeod's case, but that, owning to some erior or mis-
take m the t rocess of summoning the jury, the heating was
necessarily de eired lhe President regrets this occunence,
as he has a desire fot a speedy disposition of the subject The
coun&u for McLeod have requested authentic evidence of the
avowal by the Eritrah Government of the attack on and de-
struction of the 'Caiolme,' as acts done under its authority,
and such e\ idonce will bo furnished to them by this Depart-
ment
" It is understood that the indictment has been removed into
the Supreme Gourt ofthe State by the propel prooeedmg for
that purpose and that it is now competent for McLeod, by the
oidmary process of habeas corpus, to bring his case for hearing
1 efon that tribunal
" The undersigned haidly needs to assure Mr Fox that a tri-
bunal í?o eminently distinguished for ability and learning as the
Supreme C nrtot the State of ISew York, may be&afely relied
upon ioi the pist and impartial administration of ihe law mthis
a0well as m othei i-^es and the undersigned repeats the ex-
piession of tbede ne of this Government that no delay may be
su flor ed to t r! o place m ue&e proceedings which can be avoidf d
Of this desKt, Mi Tox w¡Ü see evidence m the instructions,
above referred to
"The rmdeisigned has now to signify to Mr Fox that the Go
vernment of tho United Stitoshas not changed the opinion which
it hasheietifoieexpitsscdtoher Maiesty's Gevemment ofthe
char icterof the act of destroying the 'Caroline '
"Undei these circumstances and under those immediately
connect d with tho nansictiun itself, it will be for her Mdje&ty'gf
Government to show upon what state of facts and what rules of
national >aw, the desf Miction ofthe 'Caroline* is to be defended.
It will be loi that Government to show a necessny of selfde-
¡ence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means,
¿wl no n omenf mi deliberation Jt will be for it to show,
also, that tho loeal authorities of Canada, even supposing the
rtc-ísuy oi the moment authori7ed them to enter the ten 1*
tones ol tit Un ted States at all did nothing unreasonable
or excessive , siuoo the act justified by the necessity of self de
fence must be ¡muted by that necessity, and kept clearly within
it It must be shown that admonition 01 remonstrance to the
¡icison-5 on hoard the 'Caroline 'was impaacucable, or would
1 ave been unavailing, itmustb^ shown that daylight could not
be waited for, ihat there could he no attempt at discrimination
between the innocent and the guilty, that it would not have
been enough to seize and detain the vessel, but that there was a
necessity, present and inevitable, tor attacking her in the dark-
ness of the mght, while moored to the shore, and while un-
iimed men were asleep on board, killing some and wounding
other , and then drawing her into the current above the cata-
Mct st ting her on lire, and, careless to know whether theie
might not bo in hei the innocent with tbe guilty, or the living
with the dead committing hei to a fate which fills the imagina
tion with honor A necessity for all thrs the Goveinment of
the United States cannot believe to have existed
'Al! will see that if such thing*? be allowed to occur, they
must lead to bloo !y and exasperated war And when an indr-
vi hnl comee into the United States, fiom Canada, and to the
vtty place on which this drama wats performed, and there
chooser to make public and vain glorious boast of the part he
