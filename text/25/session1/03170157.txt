APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
157
25th Cong....1st Sess.
Sub-Treasury—Mr. Hives.
Sen
forced the banks to yield, and they finally and si-
multaneously resumed specie paymen's on the 20th
February, 1817, the day indicated by an act of
Congreso
The inducements to an early resumption of
specie payments held out to the banks by this bill
are two fold It addresses itself both to their hopes
an their fears It says to them, in effect, that
whenever you resume specie payments, (provided
it be before a certain day,) your notes, under the re-
strictions of the bill, shall be receivablem payment
of every bi anch of the public revenue, whether for
lands or customs, but if you do not resume by that
day, your notes shall not be received m payment
of public dues, even though you may thereafter
resume The banks will thus be doubly stimula-
ted to a resumption of specie payments—by the
prom se of a benefit on the one hand—by the ex-
hibition of a penalty on the otlKr
With these provisions, I do not doubt the early
re establishment of a sound and healthy state of
things What is the present condition of the coun-
try, and what the treatment it demands 1 If we
look around us, we find all the great sources of
national prosperity still unimpaired—the land, the
labor, the capital of the country m their accustom-
ed fertility and abundance And j et industry is
paralyzed, commerce at a stand, the currency de-
graded and deranged, the precious metals fled
fron circulation, the land ov errun with spurious or
precarious substitutes for money, exposing every
interest of society to insecurity and hazard—an in
security and hazard involving alike the wages of
labor, the value of property, the fulfilment of con
tracts, all the acquisitions of the past and all the
hopes of the future Now, -«hat is the remedy for
this extraordinary state of the body pol tic1! It is
comprehended in a single word The restoration
of confidence
It will be admitted, on all hands, that the first
thing to be brought about, wnh a view to the ame-
lioration of the present condition of things, is the
return to specie payments by the banks But that
return cannot be effected without a restoration of
confidence, and confidence is to be restored mainly
by the policy and example of the Government |
With its aid in the re-establishment of conrdence,
nothing is clearer than the ability of the banks, at
an earlv day, to resume and maintain specie pay-
ments Let us, for a moment, look at the condi-
tion of the country and of the banks in regaid to
tho=e particulars which form the lea ling elements
of this question And, first, as to the stock of pre-
cious metals in the country This supply in the
country is most abundant, for, although a good deal
has gone out recently to pay off our foreign debt,
an equal, or nearly equal, quantity has come in
It is shown by official returns that the importations
and exportations of specie, during the year, v ery
nearly balanced each other The quantity m the
country at this moment, according to the estimates
and statements we have received from the Treasu-
ry Department, is nearly three times as great as it
was four years ago The means to enable the
banks to resume and sustain specie payments are,
therefore, ample and unquestionable, as soon as
confidence shall be restored Then, as to the ba-
lance of our foreign debt, which forms another
important element of this question—it has been in
a course of constant and progressive reduction for
the last six months, and with the aid of the new
crop which is now coming in, and the great dimi-
nution of foieign import , we shall soon see it en-
tirely extinguished At the same time, the great
mass of the hanks throughout the country have
been diligently preparing themselves fir a leturn
to specie payments, bv a steady and jud cious re-
duction of their circulation
Nothing, then, is wan'mg to a speedy accom-
plishment of that great object bu* the íestoration of
confidence, and it depends mainly on the action
and policy of the Government to supply that requi-
site The currency of the country is, at this mo-
ment, m the condition of a human body in a state
of suspended animation—the heart sti'l beats, the
principle of vitality is unextinguished, but the ac-
tive functions of life are suspended Let the
Government but breathe the breath of confidence
into it, and it will be at once resuscitated.   It is
the more necessary that the Government should
give its aid in this work of restoring confidence,
becai.se, whether justly or unjustly, it is from the
Government that the greatest danger of hostility is
apprehended Let this apprehension, then, be
quieted by some pledge of security, by some token
of encouragement and confidence
The Senator from South Carolina (Mr Calhoun)
asserted yesterday that the disease of the country is
debl, the only remedy is time, and that he íelied
much more on the cotton and tobacco crops for
rel ef, than upon any action of the Government
Su, the debt of the country, as I have already re-
marked, has nearly reached its e*tinguishment,
either by actual payments or the bankruptcy of
unfortu late debtors But, if this w ere not so, the
cot'on and tobacco crops, though essential ingre-
dients of relief, do not supersede the necessity of
other and auxiliary remedie' Examples are not
wanting in the financial historv of this and other
countries, to show the magical effects of confidence
in periods of gieat pub'ic distress, and how that
confidence depends on the conduct and policy of the
Government The y ear 1793 was a period of the
severest commeicial distress in Lngland More
than a hundred country banks became bankrupt,
and the wh~le country seemed destined to a similar
catastrophe, when a single act of the Government,
encom aging confidence, produced immediate and
general relief I allude to the offei made by the
British Government, in that crisis of suffering and
alarm, to lend to solvent dealers five millions of
pounds in exchequer bills A consideiable part of
the sum was not taken or even applied for, but the
simple offer of the credit of the Government, in
restoring eonfdence betweeiman and man, eucitid
the dormant resources of the countiv, and relieved
ai once the gent tal distress
Wc hav e had a similar and s nking example m
our ovvn country You well recollect, Mr Presi-
dent, the memorable panic of 1834, which ensued
on the removal of the deposites from the Bank of
the United States The storm which was raised
on that occasion was directed chiefly on the great
commercial emporium of New York The legis-
lature of that patriot c and powerful State, with a
paternal sensibility to the interests and sufferings
of her citizens, came forv aid and authorized the
cieation of a stock of six millions of dollars to be
lent co the banks, foi the purpose if sustamin¿ them
under the extraoidinary pressuie to which tl ey
were exposed What was the effect i Not a soli-
tary dollar was taken by the banks , but tl e offer
itself operated like a charm It restoi ed confidence,
and lelicved the piessure These examples may
serve to ¡ehow gentlemen that there is some practi-
cal virtue in confidence, and m the moral power
of the Government to promote and encomage it
What doc the country ask at the hands of the Go-
vernment it the pr^ent moment t Is it a lc an of
six millions'' No, sir The only boon that is
asked, the only aid that is wanted, is, that the Go-
vernment should not discredit, bv its act the great
circulating medium of the country, in wn ch ninety-
nine hundiedths of the transartions of society are
negotiated and settled, when that medium shall be
restored to soundness, and brought back to the
standard of convertibility into specie
In connexion with this subject, I beg leave to
call the attent on of the Senate to one remarkable
consideration It is this the Pres dent, in tracing
the causes of the present calamity, states that the
same embanassments and d stre ses have existed
in England as in this countr), ar sing from the
same general causes, w ith this only difference in the
result—that here the banks have suspended specie
payments, while mEiglardno such catastrophe
has occurrea This difference, to my mind, com-
prehends ev ery thing It is rendered the more re-
markable bv the fact that, during the piogress of
these diffculties, Lngland was constantly losin/
her suppH of the precious metals, me stock of bul-
lion in the bank having been íedjced from about
eight million to fom million pounds sterling, (ore-
half of her ordinary quantity,) w hile in this coun-
try, dming the same period the precious metals
have been steadily flowing in upon us, and accu-
mulating m an unprecedented manner, *o that at
the time of the suspension of specie payments we
had three times the amount of specie we ever pos-
sessed before According to the^e circumstances
the results in the two countries ought to have beea
precisely reversed We should have continued Jo
sustain specie payments here, while a suspension
of them in England would seem to have been in-
evitable Why has it been otherwise 1 How has
it happened that England, with her supply of the
precious mejals reduced to one-half her usual stock,
has continued specie payments, while we, Willi
three times the amount we ever had before, have
been compelled to suspend specie payments' The
solution must be found mamly in the fact, that in
England, in periods of commercial disfess, confi-
dence is always encouraged by Covein-nent, while
here nothing was done by the Government to ani-
mate and sustain confidence I do not mention
this as matter of reproach to the Government It
may be that the Government here believed it had
no constitutional faculty to interpose, in any man-
ner, foi the support of confidence But, unfortu-
natelj, direct and op-n attacks on the commercial
ciedit and institutions of the country, well calcu-
lated to deshoy confidence, were made in a quarter
which, iron the relation 't bore to the Government,
gave rise to lively apprehensions of hostility from
t'->e Gov prnment it-elf These apprehensions are
now again revived, by the recommendations of the
President—a recommendation which, if attempted
to be carried into execution, would, in my humble
judgment, render the recovery of the country fjrom
its prostrate condition hopeless and impossible
It is a matter susceptible of demonstration, that
if the policy of demanding specie exclusively in.
payment of the public dues shall now be adopted,
it w ill be utterly impossible for the banks to resume
specie pay ments It is an invariable law of cur-
rency, well stated by my honorable friend from.
Geoigia (Mi King)-yesterday, that if there be two
currenc es m a country, one answering all the pur-
purposes of the other, and a valuable pmpose besides,
the currency answ ermg the additional purpose will
ahvay s command a ptemium Tfrs is the condi-
tion of the country at the present moment Bank
paper constitute"* the great mass of the circulation,
while gold and silver are only to be had at a pre-
mium If the Government sh ll now adopt the
policy of leqmring payment of its dues in specie
alone, this state of things must be perpetuated.
Applicable to all the purposes for w hich bank notes
can he used, and over and abeve that, answering
the important purpose of paying the public re-
venue, from \v hich bank notes will be excluded,
specie, under these circumstances, mu«t continue
to command a premium Can the banks resume
specie payments in the face of a premium borne
by gold and silver1? The very moment they opened
their vaults, the holders of notes, in order to secure
the premium to be obtained for specie, would make
a general run upon them for cash, and, if they
opened their vaults, it v ould only be to close them
immediate!}
But again, sir wou'd not the example of the Go-
vernment, m the ind senmmate rejection of all
bink paper, have a povveiful moral influence in
e^citn? the jealousies and uspicions of the whole
community1 If the Go\eirm nt, by its acts,shall
declare b?nk paper to be vv orthless oi unsafe, will
not the people also take the alarm t Will not a
general disgust be created of all banking institu-
tions, rnd vv ill not ev ery peison holding their paper
become impatient to cosveitit into specie? In
this pe.vaomg want of confidence, their vaults
would be drained of every dollar thev possessed
It is demonstrable, iheiefore, that, under the policy
of collectirg the dues of the Government in hard
money alone, wen ver can accomplish that great
object in V hich the whole country has so vital an
interest—the le^umj ion of specie payments by the
baúl s
How does tl e p oposit on of thehonorable Sena-
tor trom Mi'sottii (Mr Benton) bear upon this
Question ' Its practical effect, if I understand it
coirectly, will be to enforce a penalty upon the
banks "or csummg specie payments In ihe amend-
ment offered by him there is a blank left for the
dav after which the revenues are p oposed to be
collected mgold and silver only tnd I unde stood
the gentleman to say it is h's intention to fill that
