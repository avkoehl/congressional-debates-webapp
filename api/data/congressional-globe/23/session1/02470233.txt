the same time, would not desire to take any course
which snould preclude-fiee discussion by those
wno were desirous to give then views upon it
Under the circumstances stated by the honorable
member fiom Geoigia, [Mr Wattle,] hewas per-
fectly correct in staling that the only motive which
he had in moving tne postponement was to avoid
the charge which might hive oeen urged against
him, for piecipitatmg the House into a discussion
upon a report, the evidence upon whichthe report
was founded not having been, under circumstances
which he could not control, furnished to them,
lie had no design to procrastn ale the subject
unnecessarily, or to give it the go-by. On the
contrary, he desired to have the fullest expiession
that cojld be given upon each and every one of
the resolutions which the commiti.ee of which he
was chaumin, had felt it then duty to present to
tne House for adoption.
In respect to the remarks made by the nonoiable
member from Rhode Island, he would only say
tnat he hoped he would be prepared, when the
question should come up, to assist then in pre-
venting unnecessary delay to a decision upon the
question He, and thoce with whom he acted,
were not to blame for the seventy or eighty days
discussion thathadaheady taken place And when
the subject had taken the course tney had always
desired, there was not much delay by the commit
tee in presenting their views He considered lhat
the documents that were appended were of the
most important charactei, and although he could
not say v/nat weight would be attached to them by
tne House, he could say that they had much
weight in inducing thecommittee to come to the con-
clusion they had on the various matters ¡eferied to
them. He tepeated that he had no wish whatevei
to procrastinate the subject, and if such an im-
pression was thrown out to the country, for himself
he felt compelled to say that there was no founda
Hon for it To evince his determination to onng
tins subject to a close, he would state that it was
his intention, whan strictly in order to do so, to
submit a motiot, for the puipose of insuring (lis
cussion and speedy action upon it, that it shall be
made the special oruer of the day, to sit daily until
a final decision should behad upon it When that
motion would be made it wou'd be seen whether
the honorable member from Rhode Island would
cooperate with him to avoid delay
Mr MILLCR advocated the postponement, not
for the purpose of putting off the debate on the
subject, which,from all appearances, was likely to
be of the same length as the session, but he was
desirous that the intervening days between this
and Tuesday should be nassed in despatching
o'her business, which was necessary,for the puo-
hc good, to be acted upon He felt it nis duty to
repe', with indignation, the remaiks in which the |
1 onoiable member from Rhode Inland had, by in |
diligence, attempted to cast censure upon the ven-
erable Chief Magistrate, for whose life of service
the courtry was so much indebted
Mr WAYNE remarked, that as he had been
misunderstood by some honoralle mettbei , he
wished to remind the House that, by us rules,
there was a positive obstacle to going on at present
with the discussion It was the right of eveiy
member to know what it was he was to be called
upon to vote foi, and if the right of calling foi the
reading of matters connected with it wasexeicised,
if the documents were not printed, it must at once
put a stop to their proceedings He would give
notice tnat if the postponement was not, acceded
to, be, in )ustice to himself, would call for the
reading of the documents.
Mr BAYLIES did not wish to be subject to
the imputation which the honorable membei fiom
Rnode Island cas' upon those who favoied the
postponement Whilst this honorable member felt
so much foi thedistiess ove the countiy, others,
howevei, were ju t as anxious as he was to av-oid
delay, but he thought it was not ]ustto go into
such a subject as the piesent without hat in? tne
fullest means to come to aright conclusion upon
it He appealed, confidently, to his own conduct
m not having occupied the time of the House, or
caus ng any delay But he had not desued to pre-
vent otheis fiom being heaid Thepostpoi ement
now will not prevent those who are desnous of
gmng their views todo so hereafter
Mi  ASHLEY thought, as the debate on this
subject was likely to be protracted, that the House
ougnt to postpone the discussion now, foi the pur-
pose of taking up and acting upon the several ap-
piopnation bills which were necessary for the
public sen ice
Mr. HUBBARD lose and said that it would
seem that no discussion can be had in this House
upon any subject connected with the public depos-
ites, witnout the manifestation of an extraordinary
excitement     This is certainly to be regretted
In ordei to iisceitain the piopnetyot adopting
the motion presented by the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, we should mquiie in
the first place what were the subjects refened to
that committee
It will be found that not only the ¡eport of the
Secretaiy of the Tieaoury was commuted to that
committee, but also various memoiials touching
the bank and the deposites weie also íefened
Many of the memorials called for a lecharter of
the Bank of the United States, otheis petitioned
for a lestoiation of the public deposites to that
institution
What has been the report of the committee in
relation to those subjects5 The committee has
recommended the adoption of a resolution that it
is inexpedient to rechaitei the Bank of the United
States. I hey have assigned then reasons for this
The committee have also lecommeuded the adop-
tion of a resolution, that it is inexpedient to restore
the deposites to the Bank of the United States.
They have stated in the body of then leport the
considerations which induced them to present this
last resolution And it must occur to evei y mem-
ber of this House that the power of the Secretary
of the TieabUiy over the public deposites has been
questioned and denied, and in lelation to that
power the committee have, at gieat laboi, collect-
ed, piepaied, and arianged a body of documents
fully sustaining taepowei of the Secretary They
have considered this as of the utmost impoitauce,
and they think that the documentary history ap-
pended to the repoit will clearly show that this
same power has been exeicised by the head of the
Treasuiy Depaitment from the foundation of the
Government to the piesent time
And now, su , whht is tne motion of the gentle-
man from I ennessee' it is, that the fuither con-
sideration of tms sub]e t be postponed untilTues-
day next. And why ' Because, sir, the report,
tnus piepared, with the documents, have not been
pubhsned and plac°d upon the tables of the mem-
bers, -that no opportunity has yet been given to
examine that lei oit
His honoraolefnend has not asked for the post-
ponement for his own accommodation, or for the
accommodation of the other membeis of the Com
mittee of Ways and Means, but with refeience to
the report, the motion has been made in justice to
himself, and m justice to the other members of
the committee It is due to them, and it is due
to the House The giounds taken by the com
mittee have been distinctly piesented in their
reoort They think that the members of this
House should have an oppoitunity fully to ex
amine and well to cons der those grounds, e\en
befoie the debate should commence It is no
more than an act of justice to them No fault
can be imputed to the committee, they cannot be
answerable for the delay which has taken place in
the printing of their report with the accompany-
ing documents On every consideration, there
fore, it did seem to him tnat the motion shouM be
adopted, and the consideiation of the subject post-
poned
Mr EVERETT, of Veimont, advocated the
motion, as a courtesy due to the committee, and
if (he said) the committee had not made the mo
tion, he should have made it himself He was
opposed to going into the discussion before the
documents were furnished
Mr H\itDIN felt no disposition (he said) to
urge the debate until the documents were submit-
ted. Kentucky had not yet been heard on the
question, and he was anxious that the discussion
should be renewed, and v hen it was tenewed, he
hoped it would be prosecuted daily, till a decision
was outlined
Mi MoKENNAN was in favor of the postpone-
ment, for the reason tbet he thought the House
ought to become acquainted with the opinions and
ulules of the people on the question   He wished
to postpone the decision of the question till the
voice oí the people had been heard m this House
from every part of the countiy. If there was to
be any relief from publicdistiess, the people must
look for it to this House They could expect
nothing from the Executive. He was also in
favor of the motion, because we ought to act
upon some important business which was now
before us He therefore moved that the consid-
eration of the motion be postponed to next Tues-
day       
Mr BURGES said, he wished to move an
amendment to the íesolutions reponed from the
Committee of Ways and Means, recommitting the
report and resolutions, with instructions to report
a íesolution dedanng that the reasons of the Sec-
retary of the Treat,uiy for the removal of the
deposites were insufficient. His object in opposing
the motion to postpone was, not to press the dis-
cussion, but to put the subject in a proper con-
dition for discussion. Now, the discussion is to
come up in the House, when the previous que&-
tion can at any time tut off the debate He wished
to put the simple question to the House, whether
they would kefp the control of the subject in the
Committee of the Whole or not' He claimed to
be permitted to call the President a tyrant without
asking leave, for he was called so by thousands
who once admned him, and he was felt to be so
throughout the suffering countiy. The President
said, in íeply to the complaints of the people, Go
home—I can govern. I have been accustomed to
govein all my life
Mi BYNUM spoke in favor of the motion to
postpone He wanted the facts to examine for
himself. He could not take them upon trust from
the gentleman from Georgia, nor from any gentle-
man. Gentlemen seized on every opportunity to
set up a cry of distiess, desolation, rum, and
tyranny The people understood this, and could
not be misled by it. They would take no man's
word foi it They understand that these denunci-
ations are for political effect, and these gentlemen
who are crying wolf, wolf, when they can show
no wolf, would be dealt with by the people accord-
ingly If the postponement for a month would
enable us to receive any additional light, let us
have it. Hoping that the question would receive
a full discussion, and be decided in reference to the
best interest of the country, he should vote for the
postponement
Mi McDUFFlE said that the report of the
Committee of Ways and Means was better calcu-
lated than any other measuie to mci ease the alarm
and distiess of the country, and he vs as, therefore,
in favor of pressing it to any early decision He
understood that the chanman did not intend to
speak, and that the gentleman from Georgia waa
readv to speak, but if the chairman had any spe-
cial íeasons for the postponement, he would, in
courtesy, consent to it,
Mr LANE said, if thegentleman from Georgia
was ready to goon with his argument, he was not
leady to heal him He had neithei read or even
seen the report of the Committee of Ways anil
Means, and therefore would not be able to judge
of tne applicability ot the aigument foi or against
it, and foi that reason should vote against the
motion to postpone until Tuesday week, and for
the one till Tuesday next He had temained asilent
and patient listener to the arguments upon the
 ub)ect of the deposites for the last tnree months;
that he would not nave broken that silence on the
present occasion, but for the imputation attempted
tobe thiown upon the cheirman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, and those with whom he
acts, by the gentleman from Rhode Island, that
he tilists he will never be capable of calling in
question the motives or intentions of any gentle-
man in this House, nor was he willing quietly to
sit and hear the motives of others arraigned The
gentleman says the object is delay Tin  is a voice
that falls upon the eai with an ill giace from gen-
tlemen on that side o' the House To review the
past, is always attended with advantage On the
J2ch ot Decembei las!, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania said, action was called foi, immediate
action, that in a few weeks, unless the deposites
should be returned, it would be too late The
gentleman from South Carohna, on the same day,
said, discussion might be sport to the members,
but was death to tne people    Mr  L said that,
