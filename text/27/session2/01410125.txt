bankruptcy, the most substantial trader is liable to be arrested,
but the presumption of insolvency arises from his lying m prl
son two months without being able to get bail"
Thus, then, it appear , according *o the argu-
ments of gentlemen, that tnsehency makes a bank-
rupt, and yet an insolvent cannot be a bankrupt
Again, sir, it is «aid, that we have no right to ex-
tend the benehis of a bankrupt law to anv other
class of our citizens than traders, becau e England
confined, at the time our Constitution was adopted,
the operation of her bankrupt laws to traders. N w,
does not every one kno*/ that the exemption o£
other classes from such laws in England was iheir
peculiar privilege"1 And whs will say that our Con-
stitution contemplated the gwnt oí peculiar privi-
leges to any class of individuáis in oar countr}?
Again, sir, it is said the original s gnificaiion oí the
word confines it to trader*.
Whj, sir, (said Mr M ) the word originally
meant a broken bench, originating vmh the Lom-
bards, who were traders, ?nd whose benches the
people would break to p.eees v hen they became
insolvent or unable to pay their debts NW, sir,
there would be just as much good sen-e in con-
struing the power given us by the Constitution to
pass uniform laws on the subject ot bank-uptcy to
mean only a power to pass uniform laws on the
subject of breaking benches, as there is in s?ymg we
must confine the operation oi such lass to the par-
ticular class with who n the term orii;inat d. It
seems, indeed, strange to me, further, sir, that gen-
tlemen should corner d that a / audulent debtor, a
man who commits fraud, can be in^úe the subject
of the beneficent operation of our laws, and beab
solved forever from the burden of contracts with
which he is unable to comply, aid tnat the honest,
fair, upnghi debtor, who has been o/erUken by
nuslorUine, and is therefore finable to pay his> debts,

Mr. W00DBR1DGE presen ed a memorial
from citizens of Kalamazoo, Michigan, calling the
attention of Congre s to the c^ Utton ot t le com-
merce of the Northern 1 kes—the losses of life
and property for the want of a proper appropria-
tion by Congress to improve the natural harbois
there The public lands, Mr W said, deprecia-
ted in value in con eqacne- of Ihe inattention of
Congress to the condition of the lake narbors The
pe'itioners ask in virtue of the general princip'e of
appropriation to improve the harbor-, en the
Northern coast frontier, that some appropriation
mav be made to improve harbor on me lakes

M'. WALKER said he was requested to present
several pe mons from the cuy o' N w York, re
monstratmg against the repeal of th  Bankrupt
bill Mr W. said, wnaWtr defnC s tl < e might
be in the bi 1, there «as no í re, and (but lor his
great respect for those wno uigcd ihem) he woull
say there wa> no plausibi'ny in tht arcuments
against the constitutionality of the measure The
ground assumed 'va% tbat it was a owe insolvent
law, fir«t, becsuse it extended to peisons other
than trader , and, <econd, b Ciu*e tie proceeding
might be comme'itffd by the bankrupt Now, tha
question had be n rrtst elab)ra ely a gucd in 1840
by his re p cled fneT1, the then abie B0na or trom

by himself on the ither, o i the tr> ition to s r ke out

that occas on he (Mr Walkfr.) had shov n ihat in

to Congiess, had frequently passed bill , cal'ed
and lecogmsed as B*ukrrpt bill , extending to all
classes, and permuting the bankrap to commence
the proceeding, and t*us same power over the sub-
ject of bankruptcy whith pre ex sted m th  Sta es,

they proposed an amendment confining the
bankrupt power of Congress to trader', there-
by admitting, as the Constitution stood, it
was not confined to traders. At the first
Congress which met in New York, m 1789, this
proposed amendment was with all others referred
in the House to a committee (of which Mr. Mad -
son was a member) of one from each Stat«. Ii
t-e report of the committee, various amendments,
as proposed, were recommended for adoption, but
not this m regard to the bankrupt question Now,
it has been said, that this amendment was not re-
commended, because that was already the true
meamn? of the Constitution, and such an amend-
ment would have been unnecessary But th" re
port negatives this position, for it chows that a'l the
oiher amendments recommenced hy the committee
and adopted, were admitted by the commit'ee to b"
declaratory only of the true meaning of theCMs'i-
tuiion, and not chants, and OBly adopted to satisf,

of ei her House. Mr W had directed a search for
it among the original papers of the House, but
•was informed that it was lost After diligent
s°arch, however, Mr W said be had fot'nd it in

Why so? Why not ra'her to the State and Colo
mal laws whicri preceded the Conslitut on, and
which rec«gniied neither of these distinction 1 and
the power which they possessed, and had rccoi-
n sed lid exercised as the bankrupt power, was the
same whici they, the S a es, bad granted to Con
gress B «ties, the fust English la <r of bank-
rap -, in the reign of Henry ibe 8th, extenl d
to all clacse=, and although it was subs^qsi i 'v r -
stricted to traders in the reign of Elizib°th,
it hal again, long before the adoption of the
Cons i u'i hi, been extended in England to a vast
number of indwduals who were not tr <iors, <md
such was the English law when oar Cnnihtutvm was
adopted In those jaws, also not only had the po*er
been extended to persons who were no* traders, but
the application1 =absiantia"ly, was permitted to be
made by thf debtor An insolvency acknowledged
in court, or advertised by the bankrupt in a newspa-
per, was permitted to be regarded as a declaration
of bankruptcy, and author z d proceedings against
him Nav, more when it was proved in the courts
of England that a cm?le creditor had procer ded at
the request, and for the benefit of the bankrupt, it
was decide i that the case came within the law, and
theref re thai, m point of fact, i was not merely a
compulsory proceeding, but might be commenced
at the instance of the debtor Beside«, the term b ink
