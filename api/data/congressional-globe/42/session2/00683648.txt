THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 20,
Mr. SCOTT. I will state that it was because
of the number of Senators who signified their
desire to speak on this, bill that I moved a
recess, so that they might have the opportunity
this evening. If, however, there are none
who desire to speak, and there is a quorum
present, we may as well dispose of the bill.
Mr. MORTON. I hope so. Our friends
on the other side are very anxious to adjourn.
Mr. VfCKERS. In order to ascertain
whether we have a quorum or not I move that
the Senate adjourn.
Mr. PATTERSON. I hope the Senator
will withdraw that, and let me call up this
little bill.
Mr. VICKERS. I will with pleasure.
Mr. PATTERSON. I move to take up
Senate bill No. 978.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection to the motion of the Senator from
New Hampshire?
Mr. MORTON. What is the bill?
Mr. PATTERSON. It is a bill reported
from the Committee on Military Affairs, pro-
viding for the payment of certain bounties to
New Hampshire soldiers. I will explain the
matter as soon as it is taken up.
Mr. NYE. I have not the least objection
to this if we are going to let others have the
same chance.
Mr. PATTERSON. There are only a dozen
lines in the bill.
Mr. NYE. But others may have bills of the
same sort, and all ought to have an equal
chance.
Mr. PATTERSON. Let us take turns. Let
me have the first one, and then you can have
the rest. [Laughter.]
Mr. NYE. It will be yours to break the
rule then.
Mr. PATTERSON. I move to take up the
bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I do not
think the Senator from New Hampshire can
have understood exactly the terms of the rule
adopted by the Senate. I ask to have it
read.

retary will report the rule adopted by the
Senate.
