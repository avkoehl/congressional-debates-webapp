Colonel SIGEL,

I have ordered Colonel Fletcher to Rolla to get that portion of his regiment now there and take them to Pilot Knob, in order to reunite the companies broken at the fight. To replace the men thus relieved at Rolla I have ordered Major Bartlett, Third Missouri State Militia, to take the detachments of that here to Rolla, and thus reunite the companies of that command broken at the battle of Pilot Knob.

Will send the Forty-seventh Missouri Volunteers Infantry to-morrow as required. The men of Third Missouri State Militia here are mostly dismounted, and we cannot furnish the horses here, as there are none. Could you not use your influence to get horses for them?
