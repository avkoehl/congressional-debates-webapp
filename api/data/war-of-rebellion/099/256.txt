SAMUEL C. GALE,

Agent, Parkersburg, Va.:

Six hundred to 1,000 troops left Louisville for Parkersburg nearly a week ago. I can hear nothing from them. Have they arrived? If so, they are to proceed immediately with the Twenty-third Army Corps. Let me hear from you as soon as possible. What is the condition of the river? I have telegraphed several times without any reply.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Over 8,000 had left by 12 o'clock last night via Columbus. Twenty-five hundred more are now loading by the same route. Three thousand will start this evening for Parkersburg on boats, and reach there in from fity to sixty hours. Probably about 1,500 more will start to-day by Columbus. Do not think I shall send any by the Marietta railroad.
