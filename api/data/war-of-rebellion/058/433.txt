U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

P. S.-The name of B. H. Grierson, which I see after having this letter partly copied, has been left out. He was appointed, I believe, without recommendation from me and for most excellent services rendered. Whether his name should not come before any of those named in the foregoing list, I respectfully submit.

KNOXVILLE, February 20, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

I sent a cavalry division toward Strawberry Plains to-day. It met a force of infantry from 3,000 to 5,000 strong on the east bank of Flat Creek, nearly all Longstreet's force. Infantry appears to be near Strawberry Plains, on either side of the river, and most of his cavalry south of the French Broad. I am at a loss to interpret his movements, unless he means to attack this place. This he will hardly do unless he has received re-enforcements. I can not learn of his having received any. I am prepared for him here, and will try to be for whatever he may attempt.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, February 20, 1864.

General GRANGER, Loudon:

Longstreet's main force is still between the Holston and French Broad. He has some infantry, a brigade or possibly a division, south of the French Broad. He has moved a considerable force to and near Strawberry Plains, and placed a bateau bridge across the river. His apparent movement is toward this place, but I suspect only to cover the one for which I wished you to be on your guard.

SCHOFIELD.

KNOXVILLE, February 20, February 20, 1864.

General GRANGER:

Longstreet's movements I think clearly indicate some aggressive design. It does not appear to be an attack upon this place. He may intend an attack upon Loudon for the purpose of getting supplies,

to be made by a portion of his force while he makes a demonstration upon this place. I think for the present stores should not be permitted to accumulate at Loudon. Push them across the river as rapidly as possible. I will send down the steamer Chattanooga to-morrow. Can you ferry stores across as fast as they are now arriving from Chattanooga?

SCHOFIELD.
