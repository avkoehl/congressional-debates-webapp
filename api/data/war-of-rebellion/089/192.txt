HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, October 12, 1864. (Received 1.40 p.m.)

General BUTLER:

The private on the lookout said about a brigade, but I doubt this very much. I judge the strength by the wagons.

Major-General BUTLER:

In what manner shall I support Terry? I have one brigade in readiness. Shall I relieve a part of his line or hold the brigade subject to his order?

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Sent for the information of General Terry. Which does he desire?*

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, [October] 12, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER:

I have investigated that report about the column of the enemy which marched to the rear. It left their line at 11 o'clock. There were with it 300 mounted men and three wagons; no artillery. There was but one interval in the column. It moved straight to the rear, then halted a little to our left, and disappeared in the woods. I imagine it to be about two regiments, say, at furthest, 500 men.

G. WEITZEL,Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, October 12, 1864-2.45 p.m. (Received 3.12 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

I have already ordered the disposition General Terry suggested, and you directed in your previous dispatches. General Marston, with his two brigades, will take up Birney's line to New Market road, and if he has anything left mass it there. One of General Heckman's brigades will take up the line vacated by Marston. This makes my lines over four miles and a half long, and this is just as much as I can do. Any change now would delay and confuse.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
