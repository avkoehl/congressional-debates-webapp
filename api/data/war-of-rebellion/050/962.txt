lant conduct in the engagement forbids the idea that he was influenced by considerations of personal safety. Bearing in mind that the commanding general having previously gone to Chattanooga, it was natural for General McCook to infer that all the discomfited troops were expected to rally there, as well as to presume that a conference with the commanding general on that important subject was both desirable and necessary, the Court cannot regard this act of General McCook as other than an error of judgment.
