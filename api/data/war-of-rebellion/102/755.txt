HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, June 3, 1865-5 p. m.

Major-General DODGE, Fort Leavenworth:

Your understand of course that it is extremely desirable to make a formal treaty of peace with all Indians on the plains in accordance with my instructions. It is desirable you can meet the Sioux in council at some designated point after they reach an understanding with Connor or his officers and have entirely ceased hostilities. I will meet them myself if necessary. Please bed your efforts to his end.

Captain JOS McC. BELL:

I have the honor to report in accordance with instructions of Lieutenant-General Grant, Major General George Sykes, at Fort Leavenworth; Brigadier General S. A. Meredith, at Saint Louis (think he should not be relieved until Captain Colman's case is disposed of); Brigadier General J. H. Hammond, Fort Leavenworth; Brigadier General G. D. Wagner, Saint Louis; Major Champion Vaughan, additional aide-de-camp, Major Van Antwerp, Saint Louis; Captain R. Graham, commissary of subsistence, Fort Leavenworth. This is all I think of now. Shall I relieve those as ordered by General Grant? Have ordered chief of staff department to send in list also.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Major-General POPE:

The Indians that committed depredations on Little Blue, this side of Kearny, were the Pawnees. We traced them to their camp and found some of the stock there; will make them give up the men. Their reservation is near Columbus, on the Loup Fork.

(Received 5. 20 p. m.)

Major-General POP:

I telegraphed General Grant requesting him to order one of the French bateau pontoon bridges built by us in Tennessee to Omaha, so that I can place it across Loup Fork and the Platte Rivers. It will be of great advantage to us, especially during high water. It will only cost the transportation from Nashville to Omaha. I can put it in without further expense to the Government. I should have sent dispatch through you but line was down. Please telegraph General Grant and approve the request. Detachments of the brigade pioneers might be sent with it.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
