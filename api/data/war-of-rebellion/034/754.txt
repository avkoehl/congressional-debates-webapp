Have received information the rebels camped 24 miles from Ripley, and moved this morning at 7 o'clock in direction of that place. Last heard from them within a mile of Ripley. I will move down and ascertain whether they design crossing at that place, but I shall also watch the road from Decatur to Maysville. They are reported over 4,000 strong.

The Indiana troops now in Ohio are composed almost entirely of farmers and business men, and their presence at home is much needed. I hope you will relieve them from duty as soon as it is consistent with the public safety.

You dispatch received, and I will order transportation for all Indiana troops at an early hour to-morrow morning. Would it not be well to send the company of cavalry from Union County directly to their homes from here?
