HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., December 19, 1862.

General GRANT:

Have ordered out all my cavalry as your order. Where is Rocky Ford you speak of? I found no map here and have none but what I have made of surrounding country that are reliable. Shall have cavalry on the New Albany and Pontotoc road. Will that be the course?

R. C. MURPHY.

OXFORD, MISS., December 19, 1862.

Colonel R. C. MURPHY, Holly Springs, Miss.:

Rocky Ford is on the Tallahatchie, about 20 miles above Abbeville, on railroad crossing. In the morning will be early enough for your cavalry to start, and then go due east from Holly Springs to watch the enemy. They must be on their guard not to be caught, and, if they can, retard the movements of Jackson until Mizner can get up.

FORT HENRY, December 19, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

Have started all my cavalry force up on west side of Tennessee. Will leave with infantry and artillery on boats in morning. Will try to get as high as Carrollsville. You are mistaken as to Mapier's force; he has about 700 men and two pieces of artillery. Have you any news? Answer

W. W. LOWE,

Colonel, Commanding.
