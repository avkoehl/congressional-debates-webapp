DUELLING IN THE DISTRICT
The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill
to prohibit the giving or accepting a challenge to
fight a duel in the District of Columbia, and for
the punishment thereof The question being on
the amendment of Mr CLAYTON to the amend
ment of the Committee on the Tudiciarv, punishing
the offence by fine not exceeding £2,000, and by
imprisonment m the co nmon jail lor a term not
less than two years
Mr LINN obseived that when he yesvri ly
proposed passing the bill over, it was not with the
intention of making any further remarks on the
subject, but that he might have an opportunity of
consulting with the gentlemin who introduced the
bill, and the Senator from Delawaie, who offered
the amendment, as to the propriety of introducing
some provision which would enable the prosecutor
under this act to obtain witnesses He «as of
opinion that no punishment should be inflicted on
the seconds and surgeons, and by this means v, t-
aesses might be procured What would be con-
sidered as a challenge would be a question for the
jury to settle, as it would be impossible to define it
m the act Gentlemen who intended to fight
might evade the law in the easiest way in the
world They might send an invilition to take tea
at some given spot, oi make an appointment fu
any trivial and fictitious purpose, taking care that
the irue one should be understood He thought it
would be the most difficult thing m tht world to get
testimony
Mr. CLAYTON said they could get rid of die
difficulty bj providing that the seconds, or any
other persons aiding or assisting m the challenge,
shall be competent witnesses, exempting them in
such case from punishment
Mr HUBBARD mqu.rcd whethei the amciil-
ment would now  be in order
Mr. LINN 'dim purpose to ope- an amend
ment He sngge-'H it to the member who intro-
duced the bill, and to the Senator from Delaware,
who, as a menbei of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, seemed to have it peculiarly in his care
He proposed it to the latter, under the expectation
that he would adopt it as part of his amendment
Mr HUBBARD expressed the hope that they
would at once proceed to take the question on the
amendment of the Senator from Delaware. If he
understood the amendment, it was to wake the
offence punishable by fine and impiisonment in the
common jail, which he opposed at some length, on
the ground that it was too lenient, and behind the
legislation of all the States who had noticed the
subject at all The State of Delaware, he said,
from which the gentleman who proposed this
amendment came, and all the New England States,
together with several others, had made thi  offence
felony, and punished H by imprisonment in the
penitentiary, and it appeared to him that they
should not, in legislating on this subject, fall below
the legislation of the States
Mr LINN drew his conclusions directly differ-
ent from the Senator from New Hampshire. If
the gentleman would show him a case in any of
the States where a man concerned in a duel had
been pronounced a murderer, or sent to the peni-
tentiary, then his remaiks would apply As he re-
marked the other day, he w anted to see a law pass-
ed that would produce some practical effects, not
such a law that a jury could not be found to carry
into execution He had seen the effects of such
law s in his own State There the punishment for
lighting a duel, where death ensued, was death,
and yet men fought duels as if no law existed at
all But they had now a law m his State which
was more effectual for the pievention of duelling
than any law that had evei been pissed In cases
as assault, all abusive words and defamatory Ian
guage went to the jury m mitigation of the offence—
Mr BENTON    As a justification
Mr LINN Yes, sir, as a justification, and if
that abuuve member, the tonjue, was permitted to
have too free a license, the same license was per-
mitted to the injured individual to redress hit,
grievance He thought if the same law was ap-
plied to the Senate of the United States, theie
would be little more decorum than he had some-
times witnessed This law, of which he had spo-
ken,had had a better effect in the prevention of duel-
ling than any that had ever been passed, and he
thought it would be better for the peace and har-
mony of society if such a law was more generally
prevalent throughout the United States
Mr HUBBARD thought their legislation should
be gov erned by the w ísdom and propriety of the
measure, leaving the execution of the laws to those
who had them in charge
Mr SMITH of Indiana saKl he rose under a
high sense of doty to his Slate, to tike part in this
debate He did not propose detaining th« Scnals
a moment longer than was necessary to enable him
to submit, in a very brief maimer his views on the
important and exciting subject before the Senate
Representing, in part, one of thegreatWestei n States,
the opinions of whose citizens on this subject had
never been expressed in thischamber, and tirmly be
lieving, as he did, that it was important to thur
character at home and abroad that they should be
fairly represented m this matter, he should offer no
apology for adtliessmg the Senate a few moments
líe concurred entirely with th* chairman of the
Committee on the Judiciary [Mr Grundy] in the
impropriety of dragging into the debate the recent
unfortunate affair between members of the other
branch of Congres-s, and he regretted that a single
Senitor had thoi ght proper to lecur m debate to
that lamentable conflict A recurrene« to that cir
cumstance is calculated to produce excitement here,
and unavoidably to disqualify the Sen <le to legis-
late with that calmness and deliberation in which
all highly penal laws should be enacted If you
examine paiticular cases, this delate cannot be
confined to the recent one it will extend to many
other similar ones that have occurred at differenl
periods of our national existence The time of the
Senate will be occaried in worse than a mere un-
profitable debate Senitors will become excited,
and crimination and recrim nation will follow, as
it may be supposed to operate on public opinion
for or against parlies oi mdiviiuals, while the
great principles of the bill will be lost in the per-
sonal contests that may grow out of the debate He
deprecated such a course, and thanked the chair-
man of the committee for his timely admonition
The recent unfortunate affair, he regietted to
see, hid been seized upon to feed the flames of
party It had been placed on party grounds, as if
one party were duellists, and the other not    This
•  ,,        .. —                             «■■-<
was an unjust and unwise ground on which to i
place that or any other similar occurrence On this
subject there were two parties, but they were not the
political pai ties that divide the people of this na-
tion He was bound, in truth, to admit the fact,
however much he might feel disposed to throw the
mantle of oblivion over that part of the past his-
tory of the country, that neither of the great politi-
cal parties can say, we are all exempt from all
participation in that mode of deciding personal
difficulties, and yet all parties speaking were op-
posed to this barbarous custom. This was not a
party question, it was a question of vastly higher
consideration than the mere political matters of the
day It was a question of hfeor death, of morality
and religion on the one side, and immorality and
crime on the other It was a duelling and anu-
duelhng question These questions can never be
circumscribed by party boundaries, nor controlled
by party considerations, they use paramount to all
political restiainls, and must stand or lall upon
those immutable and everlasting principles which
existed anterior to the formation of civil society
Mr. S would briefly notice the objections that
had been raised by Senators to any action of this
body on this subject The Senate had been told
that it was useless to legislate, that public opinion
would not cairy out their enactments, that the law
would remain a dead letter on the statute book,
that the fteedom of debate would degenerate into li-
centious personal abuse, that it was necessary
to hold m («not nn over members of Congress this
code of honor, as it was termed, to restrain them m
the exeicise of then duties heie, that the common
li«, that pun shes Ihe homicide with death, is suffi-
cient for the protection of society, these, so far as
he had heard, were the principal objections to the
proposed measure, and, while he admitted that they
had been urged with much zeal, he could not yield
to the correctness of the principles, nor to the rea-
sons by winch they had been sustained The
position had been assumed, and maintained with
much lorce, that public opinion would not bear
Congress out m this measure Mr S be-
lieved ihat the truth of the case was di-
rectly the reverse Public opinion «a , at
that moment, at the doors of the Capitol,
in a v oicr ol thunder requesting, nay, more, de-
manding of Congress to arrest this bloody code, to
stay this desolating and inhuman custom Huma-
nity and religion were suppliants in these hall ,
and shall Congress turn a deaf ear to these de-
mands, these entieaties, these supplications'? Pub-
lic opinion opposed to action on this sub-
ject' Impossible1 Where would Senators find such
a state of public opinion'* Would they find it in
the Eastern, the Middle, oi the Southeai States^
Senators say no1 Where then1 Did they look (oi
it in the West, the great West? If so, they would
search in vain for it there He spoke wuh confi-
dence of his own State, and had no doubt but that
he spoke the language of ihe othei Western States
He was aware that in early times nearly all of the
assassinations, robberies, and murders oí the world
were located m the West, and prejudices had been
excited against the Western people Those preju-
diees, however, had always been remo'ed by an
acquaintance with that people, and it was due to
them, amongst whom he had lived over twenty
years, to sa}l ih„t the world does not contam a
m<re industrious, enteipr^mg, moral, law abiding,
and honorable people He entirely concurred w nh
the honorable Senator from Tennessee, that the
West required of Congres? to puisue an efficient
course on this subject, and vi ould not be satisfied
without such action
It lias been ugued that the act, if passed, would
remain a dead letter on the statute book, that it
would not be executed He could not admit such
to be th<- fact He was unwilling to believe that
the public mind was so vicious, that there was snch
a morbid state of public feeling that jurors and
courts would disregard their oaths to acquit the
guilty But even if this were admitted to be the
case, it was no argument against this measure in
his mind Shall the Senate refuse to do its duty,
lest it shall place others in a situation to violate
their duty? Mr. S could not consent to falter m
the discharge of what be believed to be his duty to.
