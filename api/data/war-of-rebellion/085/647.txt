streams have raised but little as yet. My troops continue to arrive. The command are hard at work day and night. The guerrillas in North Missouri are co-operating earnestly with Price.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

McNeil and Sanborn with 2,500 men and ten pieces of artillery are on the Osage within ten miles of the capital. Their scouts report the enemy about 15,000 strong advancing upon us from the Gasconade. We are ready for them.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

I have joined General Brown and concentrated all the forces I can raise from my district. Can you send us a battery of artillery at once? We shall need it much and quickly.

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 5, 1864.

Brigadier General C. B. FISK,

Jefferson City:

Have none near to send. Has Price crossed Gasconade? Been raining three days here. Streams must check Price. Keep me posted. Can collect 20,000 militia very quickly if necessary.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 5, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

Shelby's troops are at the Osage. I hardly think Price has crossed the Gasconade with his main force. We shall know to-night and will keep you posted. Streams have risen but little.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 5, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

The rebels occupy up to the Osage. They destroyed the Osage railroad bridge this morning. Our troops are at the principal fords of the Osage. We are pushing the spades and concentrating troops. May the good Lord hurry up Smith and Mower.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
