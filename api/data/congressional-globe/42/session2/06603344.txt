THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 11,
The question being taken on Mr. Cox's
amendment, there were—ayes 30, noes 04;
no quorum voting.
The CHAIRMAN under the rule ordered
tellers ; and Mr. Eames and Mr. Cox were
appointed.
The committee again divided; and the tell-
ers reported—ayes 47, noes 74.
. So the amendnieut was disagreed to.
Mr. KERR, I offer the following amend-
ments :
In line six, section two, strike out ** ninety " and
insert " eigluy-iivoand in line nine, strike out
" ten " andinsert " fifteen so it will read :
That on and after the d.iy and year whon thi? act
shall take effect, in lien of the duties impssed by law
on the articles in tins section enumerated, there
shall be levied, collected, and paid on the good.*-,
"Ware's and merchandise in this section enumerated
and provided for, imported Irom foreign countries,
eight} -five per cent, of the several duties and rates
ot duty now imposed b> law upon said urtieles sev-
erally, itbeincthe intent of thn section to reduce
existingon duties said articles iiftccn per cent, of
such duties.
Mr, KERR. Mr. Chairman 
Mr. DAWES. Let us have a vote.
Mr. KERR. The gentleman will have a
vote whon 1 «ft through.
Mr. DAWES. 1 do not want to cut the
gentleman oil', of course.
Mr. KERR, it may be that it ia a waste of
time to talk about thus or any other part of
this bill any moro. But for my part 1 desire
to say that I make this motion in good faith,
because ibelit vo that this Rouse ought to con-
sider this question, tiiat.it ought not to mani-
fest such profound indifference to these ques-
tions as it does. It does not become this
House, it limy not become me to say ho, but 1 say
it with nil respect and under a sense of duty,
in my judgment it does not become this House
to ireal. these propositions with so much in-
dill'erence amounting almost to unmanly tri-
fling.
I want to say that 1 do not approve the
policy of leduciions of the tariff by a sliding
scale, and for ihis obvious and most sullieient
reason: that the tariff as it now exists whs
never adjusted upon any ptinciple of consist-
ency or equality sit all. It was adju;d ed with-
out i elerenec to piineiple ; it was adjusted a*
{miffs lor protection are always adjusted, by a 1
combination of mt<;re,-.!s and jobs ; that is the
way this tarill was made. It us not therefore j
intelligent action for this Committee of the I
)\ hole togotowoik and tinker up a miser
able system like this in this wav.
(ientlemen may inquire of me why 1 propose
to amend a had system by seeking greater re-
lief again-1 t he exist ing rates. 1 do it, as { said
before, in good faith, because it, does seem to
mi' fiom what has already tiMnspii<mI in this
House (hat (he House is resol\ed that it will
not take up and consider in detail, 1 mfyeriy,
logically, and intelligibly, the existing'law, with
all its defects and inequalities and excesses, and
reduce the rates on a rational principle. I want
some relief; a reduction of fifteen per cent,
is better than a reduction of ten per cent.,
although it leaves all the existing inequalities
in the bill.
It is therefore that I make this motion, and
I hope gentlemen will at least consider it.
Nothing less will answer the demands of duty.
I make no reflection upon any gentleman for
any motion he may make here, or any opin-
ion he may entertain. All I ask is that the
Committee of the Whole will come to a fair,
candid, and deliberate consideration of the
subject. That has not yet been done. exce(,t
wiih regard to the first section of the bill.
That of which I now complain, and which
gives me sadness, is that there is most appa-
rent an entire disinclination to grapple with
the investigation, to master i's details, or to
become acquainted with the true and rational
principles of tariff adjustment. The existing
law is full of gross inequalities and absurdi-
ties, having no sensible relation to either rev-
enue or protection.
Some of Ihe duties embraced in this part of
the law are absolutely enormous; for ex-
ample: on locomotive tire, one hundred and
sixteen percent, ad valorem; on mill irons,
&c., one hundred and live per cent. ; on iron
squares, one hundred and seven per cent. ; oil
wrought, iron railroad chairs, nuts, &c., ninety-
two and one half per cent. ; on women's and
children's dress goods, seventy percent..; on
bunting (Ibr national Hags) one hundred and
seventeen and one half per cent. ; on llaimels,
worth not over forty cents per pound abroad,
one hundred and thirteen and one half pol-
ecat. ; but on those worth eighty cents per
pound abroad, only sixty-live and two thirds
per cent. ; the lowest duties 011 the linest arti-
cles, thus giving scandalous preference to the
rich ovar the poor. Altogether, I say to the
House that such a schedule of duties does
not. prevail in the tariff of any oiher nation in
the world. In oppression of this kind our
country enjoys an unenviable preeminence.
The paper I hold in my hand will show that
many ol the reductions proposed by the bill
of the Committee of the Whole would not take
from the Treasury any appreciable amount.
Some of the reductions we propose would not
reduce revenue a penny. They aic simply
prohibitory of all importations. They were
never imposed for revenue, but for protection,
aud_ most unconscionable and dishonest pro-
tection at that, solely in the interest of jobs,
to keep out all competition, and to guard the
doors against, importations of any sort.
1 do not think ir, befits the vast importance
of the subject to attempt in such a manner to
perpetuate gross and outrageous impositions
like these in the existing laws. This substi-
tute of the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr. Dawes] only proposes to reduce these
rates by taking off a pitiful ten per cent, of
their amount. For example, the duty on pig
iron is now seven dollars per ton. His sub-
stitute will leave it $6 30 per ton. The duty
on certain kinds of blankets is now one hun-
dred and nine and three fourths per cent.
His substitute leaves it at nearly ninety-nine
per cent. But the reductions proposed by the
bill of the committee, which is itself too'low
on the articles embraced in this substitute, ex-
ceeds on an average thirty per cent, on exist-
ing duties.
If we reduce these duties to a revenue
standard, which, in my judgment, would not
exceed twenty five to thirty per cent, on any-
thing, the result would be that every one of
them would produce some revenue, and all
of them together would produce more in reve-
nue than they all do now, and would reduce
in tlje interest of the consumer of the coun-
try, the cost, of these commodities and save them
from the payment of untold millions of dollars
in bounty, or in enhanced prices. This would
be a great measure of justice to the people,
and would work no injustice whatever to the
bounty-fed protectionists and manufacturers.
But to this appeal in the interest of the con-
sumers of this country too many men in this
house are deaf. If the people understood how
this tariff law was made, and how it is pro-
posed now to be perpetuated, it is my convic-
tion (but in that I may be mistaken) that they
would rally from their own indifference an5
lethargy, and thunder in the ears of their Rep-
resentatives, their demand for justice and the
removal ot the gross wrong, inequalities, and
oppressions in the tariff' laws as they stand to-
day.
Mr. Chairman, I call attention again to an
extract from an analysis of the bill ot the com-
mittee which I hold in my hand. In it the
present duties are given and the rates pro-
posed by the committees' bill. Those rates
exceed an average of over thirty per cent, on
existing duties. iTet they are moderate, and
leave the duties to remain too high. They
would not depress or disturb a single industry.
But they would relieve the people most effect-
ively against exorbitant prices, and s.t the
same tune give greater revenue than is now
received fiom these articles. This would
occur because ail these present duties are
above the revenue standaid and simply pro-
tective, and very many of them also prohib-
itory.
1 incorporate in my remarks a part of this
analysis lor reference and to give the facts to
the people :
