Brigadier General JOHN W. TURNER,

Commanding Second Division:

There seems to be no special change in my front, except that the field pieces there yesterday has been removed this morning, and a stronger infantry force displayed. Our battery on the left seems to have an oblique (almost an enfilading) fire on the enemy's works.

Very respectfully,
