About 100 bushwhackers are within or near our borders. Six men of Platte and adjoining counties have lately lost their lives. The excitement is intense. Judge Herron has adjourned his court. The demand for 200 militia to be put on active duty is most urgent. I respectfully await your orders accordingly.
