The above figures show a somewhat larger force than the reports of the cavalry in the field, but the recruits in this city for distribution to their regiments, not shown in above estimate, will make the general result very nearly correct.

Respectfully submitted.

CAIRO, ILL., May 25, 1864.

(Received 4.45 a.m., 26th.)

Major T. T. ECKERT:

General Steele reports, in communication dated Little Rock, 21st, addressed to General Rosecrans, that rebel General Shelby has crossed Arkansas and is moving north, with force variously estimated from 2,500 to 5,000 men, and four 10-pounder Parrotts. Supposed intention to make raid on railroad between Little Rock and Devall's Bluff. Perhaps intend going to Missouri. His force is well mounted.

W. J. MASON.
