I learn from a reliable source, since writing the above, that there are 400 rebels in Stockton and 150 at White Haw, both places in Cedar County, Missouri; also 100 at King's Point and 90 near Millville, in a fort, in Dade County, Missouri. All those parties are committing depredations and swearing vengeance against the Union men.

I am, very respectfully, general, your most obedient servant,

CLARK WRIGHT,

Colonel Sixth Missouri Cavalry.
