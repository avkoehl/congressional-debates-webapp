HDQRS. ENGINEER Brigadier AND DEFENSES OF CITY POINT,October 21, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: A further reflection upon the position of the first salient south of the railroad (at Station Numbers 30) on the lines of defense here, leads me to the conclusion that gorge parapets had best be thrown up there to make it a redoubt (notwithstanding the slashing it can have in rear, which no other redoubt has). I therefore send the project* I propose to follow out there, which can readily be transferred to the plan I sent, and I would call this redoubt Numbers 6, and the lozenge redoubt at the south (the former Numbers 6.) be Numbers 7. I also send the corrected estimate* necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. BANHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 21, 1864.

General H. W. BENHAM,

City Point:

The commanding general directs that your order the One hundred and eighty-sixth New York and Thirty-ninth New Jersey Regiments to report to Major-General Parke, commanding ninth Army Corps, and the battalion of the One hundred and eighty-eighth New York Regiment to report to Major-General Warren, commanding Fifth Army Corps. These troops have been assigned to the corps indicated, and will join with as little delay as practicable. They can be sent up by railroad. The terminus of the road is very near General Warren's headquarters. If you will let me know when the troops for the Ninth Corps will leave City Point a staff officer will meet them at the Weldon railroad to conduct them to their destination.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
