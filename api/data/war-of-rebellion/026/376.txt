NAVY DEPARTMENT,

August 29, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The large naval force in the James River being no longer required there, directions are about being given to send the vessels to other points, where their presence is most essential.

If Newport News is to be held by the Army I respectfully suggest that half a dozen 200-pounder rifled Parrott guns be mounted there as a means to assist in keeping blockaded the iron-clad vessels now building at Richmond.

Very respectfully,

GIDEON WELLES.
