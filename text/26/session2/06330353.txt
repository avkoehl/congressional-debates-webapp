APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

26th Cong->-.2nd Sess,
General Appropriation Bill—Mr. Stanly.
H. of Reps.
do not afford any relief to the people. T«ey ena-
ble the Administration to contract a debt, without
appearing to do so. The relief to the Government
is only temporary. What are we, therefore, to do'
Not only the wisest and ablest statesmen of the
country, but your own Secretary, Mr Van Buren's
Secretary, with them, recommend a duty on luxu-
ries.
All admit we shall need more money tnan can
be collected at our custom-houses and land offices
dunns the present jear By the operation of the
compromise act, our reveaue will be greatly re-
duced by the 1st July, 1842.
Hear the Secretary of the Treasury on this head
On'page 11 of h's last annual report he sa?s-
"Thus the progressive reduction of the present tariff, which
has been going on since 1833, will, after December, 1841, take
effect to a much larger extent than heietofore Nearly two
millions and a half will then be deducted at once
"On the 1st of July afterwards, at least two millions and a
half more of duties will be removed, making an aggregate, in
six months, of quite five millions If the imports then should
not differ much from those in 1838, this would leave an in
come from them not probably exceeding ten or eleven millions
of dollars yearly It will, therefore, be necessary to make cor
responding reductions mthe expenditures of 1842 or seasonably
provide otherwise, m some permanent manner, to supply all
wants likely to happen from this cause "
No man in his sense5, who has watch'd 'he
course of public events for a few years past, can
expest we are to reduce the expenditures of this
Government suddenly from near thirty nine mil-
lions to thirteen or fourteen million1-. Besides, the
public debt is to be paid. What is the amount of
that debt no one here can tell. My able friend
from New York, [\ir Barnard,] m vhose judg-
ment I place the most implicit confidence, has
shown, with that clearness and force that charac-
terizes all his efforts, that our obligations not pro
vided for will amount to near forty millions of do'-
lars for "past transactions." I adopt his statement,
his knowledge is superior to mine, and entitled to
more weight than any calculation I can make-
Statement of the public debt, regarded as ascertained and
certain, existing on the \bl   January, 1841,  though the

So that the whole amount of indebtedness andliabiti
ties, on account of past tra, sactions, was, on the
1st of January, 181t, piobably notless than          S36 Ola QUO
Now, sir, I presume no man can «uppo^e that,
even if, a? Mr. Woodbury <ays the "reduction be
pushed vigorously," ne «.ball have mearía «-nough
for the years 1841 and 1842
I wish to give the Government the means vhici
it inevitably will require to pay our debts to
sustain our national honor, by meeting our en-
gagements punctually I wish todo this by ad-
hering to the compromise act—bylajiPga duty
on luxuries, which wiU scarcely be felt at all, even
by the more affluent, and will not affect the poor
man.
My amendment, Mr. Chairman, was not intend-
ed to go into operation for some months, as the
House might determine, that the importing mer-
chants might have notice, and regúlale their pur-
chases accordingly. I selected but a few articles,
that it might be liable to as little objeción as possi-
S3
ble. I was willing to adopt any amendmen's cal-
culated to effect the object I had m view. At the
time I in-reduced the amf-ndment, I had not seen
the report oi the Secretary of ihe Treasuiy, laid
before the Senate a few days since, in answer to a
resol i.ion of that bod}. If I had seen it, I would
most wil'iug!/ have incorporated many, if not all,
the article  suggested by the Secretary
And here let me say, sir, this report alluded to
doss the Secretary more credit than any paper
which has hitherto emanated from him It is Docu
ment No 95, entitled a "Report from the Secreta-
ry of the Tre?sury, communicating, in compli-
ance with a resolution of the Senate, a plan of a
permanent change m the tariff." It is conci«e,
plain, in better ityle than usual, and contains many
valuable suggestion. I hope the member^ of the
House will read it.
His construe ion of the compromise act is the
same I have always heard given to it by those
who framed and advocated its passage.
It will be remembered, Mr. Chairman, that I
quoted from the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury just now to show that by the ''progressive
reduc ion" of the present tariff, from December,
1841, to July, 1842, in six months five millions oí
dollars will be deduced from the duties.
He proposes to lay a duty upon certain merchan-
dise ' free oí dut);" his proposition, so worthy of
commendation, so replete wiihgood sense, deserves
our a'tentwn. I quote the following passages, with
the tables referred to in them.
I read from Senate Document No 93, before re-
ferred to-
"In raising the sum needed, if it does not become necessary
to subject all free articles to a duty, oi to one as high as twenty
percent anda discumination can therefore be indulged with
m the restuctions of the compromise act, it is doubtless a sound
axiom to belect for highest taxation ameles of luxury, rather
than of necessity Under similar circumstances, it is also rot
only competent, but expedient, to select such of the former as
compete most withsimllai articles of \mencan giowth oi ma
nufacture, though not to raise the duty on them above the limi
tationof twenty pei cent And another discinnination, some
times Useful, mignt be to select those articles, n certain cases,
for an increased impost, not usually exceeding the same limita
tion, which may be proper foi counterva ling injurious impostó,
placed on our own pioductions by .my foieign power Ihe
broad and well settled srourd on which the e distinctions lest,
cannot requiteon this occasion much de tiled illustration Foi
the luxunes of life are enjoyed by the few latherthan the ma
ny—the rich instead of the poor—and then use tends rather
to effemmency and pleasuie, than to what mvigoiates or makes
useful
' In a form of Government like ouis, these pnnc pies apply
with peculiar force, asan excessive indulgence m luxunes al
ways opeiates as a bane to Republican m tuners, and, in time,
to Republican pi inciples On the conhary, articles of unner
sal use, and consideicd as the necessaries of life are beneficial
to all and are to be cheapened as much as possible to promote
the comforts of all So what is Amencan may well be sup
posed entitled to receive within the limitations stipulated,
moi e incidental fav or than w hat is loreiirn, became obtained with
mote leadmess and ceualnty, as well as being more safe and
independent in nstsp Tvoi can any other country enmt lam
with justice, il we coun eiact its high taxation on any of om
products, by imposingsomecorrespondingimpostontheiis and
however unprofitable such conflicts u^uallv prove to ail con
cerned, yet when & uch a measure becomes convenient for our
own fiscal purposes, or is required by piopei self respect, and
is kept within due lestrlctions as !o the amount of duty, it is he
lieved to be ei tirUyjUsllhable Tne pre ent tariff is m many
of these respects, an anomaly Being designed to get rid ~fre
venue when ítwps loo abu idant, and to diminish a supposed
pi election to manufactuicrs, deemed umeasonablvhigh, as well
as to estab l^h certain geneialiules for keeping ail duties lower
in fwuie, it sonietm es omit ed to make useful discriminations,
and as a systun, does not sufficiently discountenance luxtin s
ot favor the neeessarles of life indeed Ihe former have aliea
dy become fiee m manv cases, an 1 m othsis w ill ie uxtd light
ly under the leduction now in piogress, while the lattei,
though at the expense of the consumer, however poor, will, in
almost every instance, bear as high if not highei burden, than
the grea est superfluity
1 In proposing a ptan to lalse the su n desired, one cardinal
object is, therefore to obtain the money in a manner that si all
not prolong any improprieties oi mtongiuities m principle,
andaoothei is to do, it, and still preseive futhtully the linuta-
tio is and stipulations of the compromise as befoie explained
To famish some data foi piactical legislation, which may ac
comphsh these designs harmomotislv, two tabular statements
have been prepaied which will next be Until) evplamed The
first one stives the names and vaiue of at! free articles imported
into the United rtates m A D 1838, al ei deducting sucn of
them as were ex| oi ted (See >l ) 1 akir g the imports of that
yeai as a guide, and perhaps neaicv an average foi some time
to come, than any other, though piobably too low and the value
of all thJ fiee anieles, exclaims ot comse specie and the
amount of others re expor'el, won11 be about S38 101 5?3 A
duty on these indiscriminately ot 15 pei cent would yield a
nett revenue not faflrom the five millrois that may be needed
in 1842 But this would omoraco «everü articles which, under
the principles bef re suggeestel, might judiciously be left free,
or af|a lower rate of duty than 15 i_ei cent
"Another mode of raising th* same amount of levenue would,
therelore, be preferable, if it could be accomplished wi hout in
eluding those articles Suppose, tl en that there should be se
lected from the free articles those which may be regarded most
as luxuries, though not in e^er) respect belonging exclusively to
that class Such are teas, coffee, and silks Should we then
add to them others, conflicting with similar American produc-
tions, such as worsteds linens, &c and the aggregate, deducting
the amount re exported, would be $29,026,448 (See the second
table, B ) A duty of twenty percent on those, after paying the
epenses of collection, would yield about the same amount ot
five millions This seems to contain the general data for the
most eligible and unexceptionable revision If a lesa sum
than five millions should prove to be needed, as it is presumed
will be ths case under the diminished expenditures and in
creased importations, anticipated and exp allied m the recent
annual report on the finances, ás well as from'the further aug
mentation of revenue likely to happen from the new mode of
assessing the value of merchandise, any suitable modifications
can be made in these details, without departing ¿om the
principles believed to be the most apppropnate to govern the
subject

Thus it will be seen, sir, if we only lake the arti-
cles enumerated m table B, and lay a duty of 20
per cent, on them, that, after paying the expense
of collection, they would yield nearly or quite five
millions of revenue. Wines are not included in this
estimate either.
Now, when we are actually pressed for money—
when our Treasury is bankrupt—when we are in
deot—our country in a deplorable condition for
want .if defences—our navy rottmg from neglect—
does it not become us, as patriots, to provide for the
wants of the Government while we can do so with-
out imposing any burden upon the people, upon the
laboring classes of the country? "Will you Mill
force the Government to borrow money, by-
issuing Treasury notes and paying interest to iavo-
nte banW Will ycu force the coming Admims-
tranon to call an extra session to remedy your
abuses, to provide for your wanton extravagance?
Can you not be induced to do something for a suf-
iering country, to do one good act before you let
ihe power pass from your hands? Or will you pre-
fer to die as jou have lived, blinded by the malig-
nity of party spirit, deaf to the prayers of a suffer,
mg people—following, to the last, the ael*din§
wbispeis of the demon of faction?
