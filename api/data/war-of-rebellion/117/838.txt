I certify on honor that I issued to the prisoners of war at this post during the months of July and August 21,500 rations of salt in addition to the regular months of July and August 21,500 rations of salt in addition to the regular ration, on account of the large amount of fresh beef issued. The weather being very warm it was absolutely necessary to make this extra issue to keep the beef from spoiling. The whisky was issued on requisition of the surgeon-in-charge for the use of the sick in the Yankee hospital.

GENERAL: In reply to your note* of this date I would state that, having confidence in your experience and knowledge of the best method of conducting a correspondence relating to military matters, I leave it to your judgment to decide upon the mode of forwarding the communications in question. It was my intention that copies of the letters inclosed to you should be embodied in your own letter to the Federal general but if you think it better to modify the arrangement I will be glad to have you do so.

Very respectfully, yours,

JEFF'N DAVIS.
