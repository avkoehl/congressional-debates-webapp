The United States have credited the State with 2,794 more volunteers (as supplied by regiments and companies) than is claimed to have been furnished. This credit was given before the Department knew the number which the State claimed as having furnished.

The State claims to have furnished 12,311 more recruits for regiments in the field, "old organizations," than the United States have given credit for. It is therefore seen that the number in dispute is made up of recruits for old regiments.

The difference between 12,311 and 2,794 is 9,517. This is the number for which the State claims to have received no credit.

In making up the statements or exhibits the numbers were taken from the muster-in rolls of regiments, companies, and detachments, as filed by the duly appointed U. S. mustering officers for the State. Where, as in some few instances, no muster-in rolls of regiments were filed, the numbers were taken front he first muster and pay rolls of the organization.

It will be seen by a letter to the Governor of date June 2 that the Department contemplated a comparison of the State records of men furnished with those of this office. In answer to that letter the adjutant-general of the State, under date of July 9, furnished a statement, from which the numbers herein referred to, as claimed by the State, have been taken.

As the present records of the Department will not allow a credit to be given for the disputed number (9,517) of recruits, it remains for the State to show, by the muster-in rolls thereof, that she is entitled to said credit. As the statement from the adjutant-general of the Stated does not exhibit in detail the data upon which the claim for the disputed recruits rests, it will devolve on special comparison of the State with the U. S. records to show that the State is justly entitled to the credit therefor.
