Numbers 96.

Report of Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, First Maryland Infantry, of operations May 29-June 9.*
HEADQUARTERS MARYLAND LINE,Camp on Mountain, June 11, 1862.

MAJOR: On Thursday, May 29 ultimo, this command, Brigadier-General Steuart, commanding Maryland Line, marched from Martinsburg to beyond Charlestown. On the 30th it was ordered toward Harper's Ferry. The enemy were found on Bolivar Heights, and, after driving in their skirmishers with a few sharpshooters from the First Maryland Regiment, our artillery, Captain Cutshaw's battery, drove them from the hill. I then advanced with Company A, Maryland Cavalry, and my regiment, and took possession of the heights. We captured the camp of the enemy, full of stores and arms. I went tot he Potomac. Very soon he opened on me from a battery at Barbour's house, and a gun to our right, when, having no artillery to support me, I was ordered back by Brigadier-General Steuart. I went into camp 2 1/2 miles east of Charlestown, without rations, my wagons having been sent forward. The next day, 31st, I was rear guard of the army, and marched 7 miles beyond Winchester. The next day, June 1, also rear guard; marched beyond Strasburg. On the 6th of June, 2 miles southeast of Harrisonburg, I became engaged with a force of the enemy-one brigade and the First Pennsylvania Rifles (Bucktail Rifles), (Captain [Wilson C.] Nicholas, Company G, captured their colonel, Kane), and, together with the Fifty-eighth Virginia, Colonel [Samuel H.] Letcher, we drove them back. Here I lost Captain M. S. Robertson, Company I, a gallant officer, who fell at the head of his men, in a charge, shouting, "Go on, my men; don't fall back for me." Here also fell Second Lieutenant Nicholas Snowden, a true and brave soldier, who died as became his life, in the arms of victory, with his face to the foe. Near him fell the chivalric Ashby. Here also died Privates [William E.] Harris and [L. R.] Schley, Company h; Murphy, Company G, and [E. W.] Beatty, Company D. Beatty was advanced in years, and has steadily refused promotion at my hand, preferring to carry his rifle in defense of right and honor. Besides these 6 killed outright, I lost 11 men wounded, 4 or 6 mortally, making 17 out of 150 men engaged. My colors fell twice, but were caught before they touched the ground. Color Sergt. Joseph Doyle was severely wounded, and left in a house in the neighborhood; Color-Corporal Taylor was badly shot, and Color-Corporal [Daniel] Shanks carried them the rest of the time. I subjoin a list.+
