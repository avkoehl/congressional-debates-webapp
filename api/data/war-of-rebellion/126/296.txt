During the year the railroad from Alexandria and Norfolk have not borne a prominent part in extended military operations, but were used almost entirely for local purposes.

In the vicinity of Petersburg thirteen miles of new railroad were built to supply the army of General Grant during this siege of that place.

Upon the surrender of Petersburg, Richmond, and the army of General Lee, the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, twenty-one miles long, was immediately opened; also the line from Petersburg to Burkeville, fifty-two miles.
