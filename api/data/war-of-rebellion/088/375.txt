CITY POINT, August 21, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding:

General Ord has extended so as to hold a greater front to relieve as many as possible of the Army of the Potomac to go to General Warren's support. To hold what he now does, two or three more batteries ought to be sent to him. Have you got them to spare? If so, send them. Two will probably be enough.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
