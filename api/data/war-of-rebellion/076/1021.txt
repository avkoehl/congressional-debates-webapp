RICHMOND, September 5, 1864.

(Received 6th.)

General J. B. HOOD:

Your dispatch to General Bragg of the 3rd instant has been referred. To re-enforce your army all available troops were sent, and realizing the necessity for a further increase, the reserves, detailed men, and militia were called out. General Cobb informs me that you have ordered the troops sent from Augusta and other points to Macon to return to their posts. I cannot reconcile this with your declaration that re-enforcements are absolutely necessary, or with the necessity for a prompt and vigorous movement upon the enemy before his divided forces could make a junction, or re-enforcements be sent him from Tennessee or Mississippi.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, September 5, 1864.

General W. J. HARDEE:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. The necessity for re-enforcements was realized, and every effort was made to bring forward reserves, militia, and detailed men for the purpose. Polk, Maury, S. D. Lee, and Jones had been drawn on to fullest extent; E. K. Smith had been called on. No other resource remains. It is now requisite that absentees be brought back, the addition required from the surrounding country be promptly made available, and that the means in hand be used with energy proportionate to the country's need.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, September 5, 1864--7.30 p. m.

No change in position to-day.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 5, 1864.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

To let you know what a disgraceful effort was made by our men in the engagement of August 31, I give you the wounded in the two corps: Hardee's corps, 539; Lee's, 946; killed, a very small number.

J. B. HOOD.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 5, 1864--10.45 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

I think the operatives has better remain. They are a protection to their shops against raids and would be of better service to me. If re-enforcements are sent, should be organized bodies. Every effort is being made to gather absentees.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
