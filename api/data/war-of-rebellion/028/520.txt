* * * * * * *

XI. Paragraph VIII, of Special Orders, No. 305, from these headquarters, is so far modified as to direct that Major-General Morell assume command of all the troops from the mouth of the Antietam to Cumberland, including the command of Brigadier-Generals Kelley and Kenly.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, October 31, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

Our engineer advises us that he has again restored the masonry for the erection of an iron span as part of the bridge at Harper's Ferry. You are aware of the large losses heretofore, and of the heavy cost of the proposed iron structure. The advantage of this central span, in case of freshest sweeping out trestles, you, doubtless, appreciate. Do you think the prospects of permanent military protection at this point are sufficiently favorable to justify us in again incurring this large expenditure? Your advice will oblige us.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 31, 1862-8.30 p. m.

His Excellency ANDREW G. CURTIN,Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pa.:

Please inform me whether there are clothing and arms at Harrisburg for the drafted men about to be sent to the old Pennsylvania regiments in this army.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, October 31, 1862.

Major N. H. McLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cincinnati:

The report that the enemy retreated by Brownstown, &amp;c., was only partially true. Part went up to Gauley Bridge, to which point I am pushing forward Lightburn's division as fast as supplies can be got up. Crook is at Sutton, moving toward Summerville and Gauley Bridge. Our greatest embarrassment is lack of land transportation. The Kanawha has risen 3 feet, and gives steam navigation 10 miles above here. Will report fully by mail.

J. D. COX,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS, Charleston, October 31, 1862.

Brigadier General GEORGE CROOK, Sutton:

Press forward to Summerville, making every effort to keep will supplied. The enemy retreated precipitately on the approach of our force
