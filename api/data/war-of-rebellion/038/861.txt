Major R. W. MEMMINGER,Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I have been unable to find or hear of any crossing place on the Big Black below the railroad bridge.

I have been to Mrs. Bachelor's plantation this morning, 3 miles below on this side, where the river can be approached near the Big Pond, but the country opposite, as far down as the mouth of Fourteen-Mile Creek, is represented as an impenetrable jungle, intersected with sloughs and ponds. This information corresponds with what I received while stationed at Smith's. I have sent two staff officers over to examine the east bank, and ascertain definitely everything bearing upon the case.

If the main attack comes against Big Black, it will be necessary to throw a force on my immediate right, behind the levee.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
