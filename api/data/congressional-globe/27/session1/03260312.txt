ti e dt tiess and emban i ^ment
Mi p th^n proceed d to contrist the cncurastance& rinde
which the pieviousnatioral banks had Veen cieated with thos
of theconntiy at this 'ime aieumg to show that, if a ban1
si onld be established now, foreign exchai ge would be again*-
he count! v, and if Government did not interpose to aid th
bank, by creating some sou of excheqnei bill*, it would not
stand six months This, he sa d, the people never would coun
tenance or tolerate He Vent mto some statistical statements,
showing what had been the course if the last bank, and what
had led to us rum He did not spare the Penn ylvania bank,
which he designated as a Iiamel house of corruption, disgust
nif* and revolting to behold
He next went mto the allegi d power of a National Bank to
legulate exchanges, which he utteily denied The true mean
ing of exchange was the diffeience between cash and the value
ola hill drawn upon a particular poi t, but, mthe modern u*e
of the term, it had come to be consideied as merely the differ
erce between bank notes of dineie it banks Thus in Savau
nahtheie were bank* which pail andothei banks which did
not pay specie and the difleiencem the value of their notes
was called exchange It was a mere absurdity bo to call it,
a dthe argument budded on it wa& a meie catchpenny argu
ment
in confiimatton of his position that the United States Bank
nevei did in this mo tin sen e, equalize the exchanges of
the country Mi P qnot d a Ion? t<ib3e in d tail showing the
rates of exchange m diffetent \ears duiing the lifetime oí the
bark He mostee that neither a r\ational Bank nor the Go
vcium n itself noi anj oth i power on eaith could or ever
had íc'ulated exchange, 1 ut the touise oftiadc, which was as
nresistible and uncontrollable a^tnelawsof is ature, but be
ing itself controlled by the íelation of demand to supply He
tiaced the contiaryidea to the English financiers,and th h in
ferencesfrom theoaeianonsof the Bank of England butgave
it as his opinion that theie ne^ernad b en a greater fallacy
Heiehel much on the fact that while the Bank of England
had ltici eased r er bullion nine mi lions m 1813, yet the course
of foreign exchange had been steadily against the bank The
theoiy assumed many things which were not true, but were
on the "ontiaiy imi ossible such as that the course of trade,
the state of the tautf, and the amount of products m foreign
countries remained alwajs the «ame Even when England was
impoiting giain fiom abioad, exchange remained against
her
But if i National Bank could regulate domestic exchange,
how could it do it^ As it hadm 1819, '20, and 21, by breaking
all the bouthem bank , that it mi ht concentrate all the specie
of the country initsown vault&J Such mu t again be the in-
evitable effect of a. central bank with bi inches m the States
He quoted a lettei of Mr Biddle'stn i committee of Congress
in 1^2 He insisted that the appaient equalization of ex
chmge*! was deceptive and the mere effect oí transferring bro
kerage from private counteieto the counters of the branch
banks, while labor feit i o benefit from the operation
Mi P now went m o a history of the causes ofthe revul
sun in business which oecuncd in 1837, wh eh he tiaced not
to any wai ofthe Government against tho Bank of the United
totates but to the couise pui->ued by the Bank of England m

ir creasing hei bullion fou millions and cuitaihng her dis

larsm asmgleyeai fiom theamount of cnculation In addi
tion to this hid come the effect of the deposite distribution bill,
which ggravtfed the evil an 1 piecipitated the catastrophe
That it was not owing to the isub Treasury, he insisted, was
piove 1 by the fact that trie «ame an 1 gn a ei distress was ex
pcnenc*" loimuHd.net u !y in Englandand a! o in some parts of
tho continent
Mi P mveighe i wi h orne vehemence agam t he plan of
the Pineal Bank as a political measure and a Treasury Bank,
as a monster g d cogen 'ere 1 n liaud ard brought forth in cor
uipfion and ivowed his detei mm ition never to bow m worship
before such a houil idol Neither would the country, they
would give all vested rights to the winds, tear up all parchment
