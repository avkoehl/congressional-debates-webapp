ORD'S HEADQUARTER,

April 2, 1865-7 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Just heard from Gibbon, who must have before this received my order to go to support Wright. He says "I advanced my skirmish line well supported and drew a heavy fire of infantry and shots from three or four guns at different points along the line. Some of this skirmishers got across the swamp in front of Dandy, but fell back to their pits." Since the above I hear General Gibbon has moved to Wright's support.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

Harris' brigade has taken the works on north side Hatcher's Run, and is moving up on north side. Colored troops are being put in also near the barn. The fort south of run reported evacuated.

Major-General ORD:

Wright and Parke have broken through the enemy's line. Humphreys sent off a division to Sheridan last night; he is, nevertheless, doing all he can offensively, proceeding cautiously. How is it on your front? Wright and Parke have taken guns, flags, and prisoners.
