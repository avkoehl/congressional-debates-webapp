the Clements house. McLaughlen's brigade was thrown across the line and moved out at an angle with Hartranft until the enemy's skirmishers were encountered. Hartranft came into the Smith house field and discovered a working party of the enemy in a redoubt near the Hawks house. Skirmishers were thrown forward by General Hartranft, before whom the working party retired. A position was now taken across Smith's field to the redoubt, and from there along and across the line of works, and the whole line of skirmishers advanced, driving back the enemy's line about half a mile to the left and front. Their cavalry were in front of Hartranft and hovered around his extreme left with some annoyance. infantry appeared to be on McLaughlen's front. Meantime Harriman encountered no force, but his scouting parties reported a column of the enemy moving toward our left. A report to the same effect was received from General Potter also. The enemy's skirmishers halted on a ridge covered with brush, and I ordered General Hartranft to push a reconnaissance down the road as far as possible toward the plank road, and reported the situation of affairs to the major-general commanding. His orders were to keep up the connection with Harriman, make a drive at the enemy's skirmishers, but avoid bringing on a general engagement. I then ordered Hartranft to swing up his left, and as soon as he got into line with McLaughlen to attack with his skirmishers simultaneously with those of McLaughlen. During the execution of these orders the enemy's skirmishers advanced. The reconnoitering party were attacked at a cross-road about half a mile from the line by a small party of cavalry, which was repulsed, and considerable skirmishing ensued in front of both brigades. At two points our pickets were driven in. I had some reason to expect an attack in force, and I ordered the troops to close in, and my action now being left discretionary with me by General Parke, I determined to resist with my whole force. Hartranft drew in his left, and McLaughlen re-established his picket-line where it had been assailed. The firing along the front of the two brigades rather increased, but no attack was made. I remained on the ground till 6 p. m., when, in obedience to orders, I established a new and advanced picket-line in front of the intrenchments between the Pegram and Clements houses, and withdrew the troops to their camps.
