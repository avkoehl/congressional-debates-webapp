Commodore T. TURNER,

Commanding U. S. Naval Forces, &c., off Charleston:

SIR: In further reply to your letter of the 21st, received on the 27th ultimo, I have now to say, after due investigation of the subject-matter, that the facts of the case appear to be as follows:

On the morning of the 21st February, 1863, the U. S. S. Flambeeau appeared under a flag of truce, distinctly visible, making her way in the direction of the harbor, as if wishing to communicate. Being near enough for the purpose of communication, the commander of a battery on Sullivan's Island fired a shot as a notification to the vessel to came to, which not being complied with he fired three other shots, not at the vessel, but to stop her course, and to make her desist from he sounding which were being made at the time by a boat detached from the Flambeau, a proceeding deemed altogether irregular and unwarranted.

This report of the battery commander is further corroborated by the statements of persons at other points of view.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
