Major-General THOMAS:

The following dispatch just received from General Van Cleve, dated 1. 40 p. m. to-day:

Private Sawlette, Fourth Kentucky Cavalry, came in this morning and reports that he was captured on the 27th instant by some of Forrest's men at Woodbury. The rebels said that they had been to Sparta carrying dispatches from Forrest to Williams and Dibrell, who were at Sparta. Citizens from Woodbury report that Dibrell and Williams were at McMinnville last night. Small parties of rebels are in the country.

Major-General THOMAS:

I left at Pulaski two regiments Tennessee cavalry, numbering about 900, about 600 of them mounted. Portions of the Ninth and Tenth Indiana Cavalry now mounted, and dismounted about 600. Three pieces of artillery in a fort and surrounded by rifle-pits on an impregnable hill, if defended; also two companies of demoralized colored patriots who ran away from block-houses below Pulaski. It will not pay to take Pulaski, and if defended I have no fears. I am far more uneasy about our depot of supplies at Johnsonville. We have immense quantities of supplies there and little less than negro troops to guard them, except two gun-boats. The wires seem to be all right now.

General THOMAS:

A boy, belonging to Fifth Tennessee, not uniformed, was captured near Lynchburg yesterday, by a few rebel soldiers, and was taken to that place, where he said he saw what was said to be 5,000 men and sixteen pieces of artillery. He was released and started for this place. On the road he was picked up by our cavalry and brought in. This morning General Milroy sent him to Lynchburg, and he has just returned. The citizens told him that Forrest had gone on the Chestnut
