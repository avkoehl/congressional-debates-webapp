WESTON, October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General CRAIG:

Bushwhackers entered Ridgeley last night and robbed people of about $2,000. I will send scout in that direction if we are not needed elsewhere at present. They are commanded by Chiles.

H. HILLIARD,

Major, Commanding Post.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., October 17, 1864-8 p.m.

Major HILLIARD, Weston, Mo.:

Send a force after Chiles and keep a sharp lookout in the direction of Ray. I have a dispatch from Colonel Shanklin at Chillicothe that he has information he deems reliable that Major Deagle surrendered Carrollton to a rebel force said to be from 300 to 500. You can have re-enforcements when needed.

JAS. CRAIG,

Brigadier-General.

General CRAIG:

Colonel, Commanding.

J. H. SHANKLIN,

Colonel, &amp;c.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., October 17, 1864.

Colonel SHANKLIN, Chillicothe:

Glasgow is not evacuated. Colonel Harding is there and able to hold the place. Re-enforce Deagle. Am trying to get you additional arms.
