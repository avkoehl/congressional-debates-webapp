As the major starts back at once, I can do no more at present than simply acknowledge its receipt. The capture of Savannah, with all its immense stores, must tell upon the people of the South. All well here.

Yours, truly,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 19th instant is received. I have already written you fully since arriving here, in answer to your previous letters. I am very glad to learn that Jeff. Davis is in the condition reported to you, and hope that before this time he is dead and out of the way. From my intercourse with the people of Georgia I think it would give great satisfaction to them generally to know that this was so. Still I shall, of course, go on with my preparations without reference to anything of the kind, and as though the Southern Confederacy possessed all the vitality which they boast of.

Very truly, your friend, and obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

GENERAL: In my letter to you of this morning I omitted to answer your inquiry in relation to our prisoners held by the rebels. I have reason to know that they were hurried down from Millen to Savannah, and from here, on our approach, were sent down the Gulf railroad to its termination at Thomasville, and have since been taken back to the old place at Andersonville. I have had my cavalry down to the Altamaha, some fifty miles down the Gulf road, and do not think this is the point from whence they could be reached; but if an expedition were sent up the Appalachicola River, and the Apalachicola Arsenal taken, I think they could be reached from that direction.

Very truly, your friend,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Admiral JOHN A. DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Squadron, near Savannah, GA.:

ADMIRAL: Your note of this date is received. Captain Boutelle and Captain Fillebrown had already reported to me, night before last, to the same effect, that the Wilmington River was the best channel, and navigable up to Thunderbolt for vessels of fifteen feet draught; but I had not heard further from them. I will refer your letter to General Easton,
