there yesterday; have been five days in country toward Pocahontas and Salem; they heard nothing. Jackson's cavalry force scouts from here; have scoured the country along Hatchie west of here and find all quiet.

I don't think General Brayman's information reliable as to Jackson passing Saulsbury in this direction. All quiet toward Savannah and eastward. Good many report 300 cavalry east of Tennessee River, opposite Saltillo, yesterday evening.

The last information we have had is that they are at Ball's Bluff Bridge. Suppose are repairing bridge.

Have re-enforcements started?

The enemy is right upon and between here and Bolivar. We cannot fall back, but will send them home.
