GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. GOVERNMENT WORKS, ORDNANCE, Numbers 1. Macon, Ga., August 4, 1864.
I. In obedience to instructions from the Chief of Ordnance, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va., I assume command of the ordnance department in this city, embracing the arsenals, armory, and laboratories.

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding Government Works.

RICHMOND, August 5, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD:

Yours of August 2 received. I concur in your plan, and hope you cavalry will be able to destroy the railroad bridges and depots of the enemy on the line to Bridgeport, so as to compel the enemy to attack you in position or to retreat. The loss consequent upon attacking him in his intrenchments requires you to avoid that if practicable. The enemy have now reached a country where supplies can be gathered by foraging expeditions, and a part of your cavalry will be required to prevent that. If he can be forced to retreat for want of supplies, he will be in the worst condition to escape or resists you pursuing army. General Hardee's minute knowledge of the country, and his extensive acquaintance with the officers and men of the command, must render his large professional knowledge and experience peculiarly valuable in such a campaign as I hope is before you.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

ATLANTA, GA., August 5, 1864.

His Excellency President DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

Your cipher dispatch of to-day received. There is no material change in the enemy's position. He is endeavoring gradually to extend his right.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

General CHEATHAM:

General Hood thinks it will assistant General Lee if you will cause General French to make demonstration of attack to-morrow about 7 a. m. He does not wish, however, that there shall be any great sacrifice of life.

F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.

[Indorsement.]

General FRENCH:

I will call to see you in reference to the within. Hold your command in hand.

B. F. CHEATHAM,

Major-General.
