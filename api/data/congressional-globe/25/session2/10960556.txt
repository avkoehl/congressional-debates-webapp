25th Cong«-««Snd Sess.                                   Annexation of Texas—Mr. Preston,                                                                   Senate.
turns go on with warmth, and without violence The President
is inaugurated, and Congress assembles, with aa little commo-
tion as we have withm these walls Administration and Oppo
sition parties differ, debate, and denounce, with as much zeal
and as little danger as here, while the judge as peacefully
rides his circuit, and the sheriff aa promptly executes his judg
ments, and the constable e staff is as omnipotent as m any other
land which íeposes under, and is blessed by, the common law
Such is the spectacle which (his young Sute presents to the
view of gratified philanthropy Thus has she fufilled the pre
dicüoni which attended her birth
The proposition which I now submit m regard to this pros-
perous and self dependent State would be indecorous and pte
sumptuous, had not the lead been given by Texas herself L
appears by the correspondence of the Envoy Extraoidwary of
that Republic with our own Government, that the question of
annexation on ceuam terms and conditions has been submitted
to the people of the Republic, and decided in the affirmative by
a veiy large majority, whereupon, and in pursuance of m
sttuctions from his Government, he proposes to open a nego
nation for the accomplishment of that object The cone
spondence has been communicated upon a call from the House
of Repiesentatives, and thus the proposition becomes a fit sub
ject for the deliberation of Congress
Nor is it proposed by my resolution, Mr President, to do any
thing which could be justly construed into canse ot offence by
Mexico The terms of the resolution guard our relations with
that Republic; and the spirit in which it is conceived is entire
ly averse to any compromise of our national faith and honor,
loi any object, of whatevei magnitude More especially would
I have our intercourse with Mexico characterized by fan deal
ing and moderation, on account of hei unfortunate condition,
resulting from a long-eontinued series of intestine dissensions,
which all who have not been born to liberty must inevitably
encounter in seeking for it As long, therefoie, as the pieten-
sions of Mexico are attempted to be as&eited by actual force,
or as long as there is any reasonable prospect that she his the
power and the will to resubjugate Texas, I do not propose to
interfeie My own deliberate conviction, to be suie is, that
that peno 1 has already pissed audi be^ leavi to say thai, m
my judgment theie is more danger of an invasion and conquest
of Mexico by Texas, than that this last will ever be reannexed
to Mexico Th enter aimng of this opinion, perhaps, tonsti-
tutes the only difference between mine and the views of the
Executive, as declared m the correspondence with the Texan
Minister, Gen Hunt The negotiation is declinedbv the Se
cietaiy of Stale, beciuse it would imolve our rela ions with
Mexico Now, sir, I do not conceive that Mexico, m the oh
vious hopelessness of opeiations against Texas, should so con
sidei it I admit, howevei, that the Executive has the most le-
gitimate jurisdiction of this question, and is doubtless m pos-
session of more extensive ana exact information upon it than
we can have It is, therefoie, avoided in the resolutions,
which import a declaration of opinion in favoi of the annexa
tion of Texas, only when it can be effected without a disturb
ai ce of our relations witn Mexico I do not understand—I
should be very unwilling to believe—that the Admmis ration
has taken decisive giounds against my proposition, in every
contingency Indeed, I believe lean show that lam wairante 1
in entertaining the opinion that the opposite is mus- Probably
thetnnh It wai obviously proper for the Sen t tar y oí S "He
to avoid, m his correspondence with a foreign minister any n
dication of the policy of the Government m the contingency
contemplated by my resolution but what that opinion w mid
be, if it were proper to avow it, may be mf'iied horn the fict
that the Pi evident himself has here'ofne, as Secretaiy of State,
while cariymg into effect the policy of his pmleces oi to wtu -u
great measures he is devoted and pledged, exerted all his ibihty
to accomplish this object, that Mr Poinsett, the & cietaiy of
War, has been sedulously engtged in the sam" enterprise, tin
der ihe auspices of two Administrations aid that Mr Fur
syth, the Secretary oi State, 13 a Georgian by b-rth and allegi-
ance, and will not, therefore, be suspected of cmeiiammi? dif
feient opinions It is not to be supposed that the remainder of
the cabinet could exert suffk ten* influence to overcome me «en
timentsof these thieegentlemen, or would, for a moment, en
tertam a purpose of reveling the faun lit, policy of General
Jackson
I disavow, Mr President all hostile purpose?, or even ill
temper, towards Mexico and I trust that I impugn neuher the
pohev nor principles of the Administration I therefore ftp I
myelfat liberty to pioreed to the discussion of ihe points made
in the resolu ion} entirely disembarrassed of any prehminaiy
obstacle, unless, indeed, the mode by win h so important an act
is to be effected may be considered as interposing a difficul y
It the object itself be within the competency of this Govern
meat, a  I shall hutafter endea. oi to show, nd both pauies
consent, every me ins mutually asreed upon would establish a
joint obligation The acquisition oí new territory las here o
íoie been effected by treaty, and this mode of proceeding in re
gard to Texas has been propo ed by her Mmister hut I be
jieveit would comport more with the impoitance of the mea
sure, that both branches of the Government should concur, the
Legislature expressing a previou^opimon, and, his r-emg done,
alhlifncultips, wfall kinds what«toe\ei real nr imagina*} might
be avoided by a tieaty tripartite between Mexico, Tex?s, and
th United & ates, in vvbich the accent atil confirmation of
Mexico (for a pecumaiv consideration it you choose) ini<-h* be
had, without infringing the acknowledged independence tnJ
free asency of Tex"s
I will now proceed to show that the teirnoi} actua ly occu
p ed by the Republic of Texas was at one unit- a part of the
Unite 1 States
In [7b2 Tiance ceded Louisiana to Spam Tn lfi00, b\ tim
treaty of Ildefonso, Spam le ceded it to Fiance — (&at ti evv>' ^
of the treaty )
in 1S04, Frarce, by the Uea v of Lomsiav, ceded uto tne
Unite! -aates The United ¡states thu"* obtained title to what
evei was conveyed to Spam by the treaty nf 1762, the efh rt of
the inteimeuia e conv yancobeiofi preci^el v the same aaii the
conveyance by the tuaty of 1762 had been m toe dnectlv to us>
ínsteitl oí to Spain 1 he extent of the I rench claim therefoie
deteiminetou s The tule of Trance to the Mississir pi, ani' i
the territory drame 1 uy its wtstern tributaries, has never fet n
disputed It rested upon the discover* made by I a Salle in
1683, who penetratedliom Canalalyiaid descended'he Mis
feissippi, and established a few posts on its banks A snort t me
afterwards. La Salle, endeavoring to enter the mouth of the
Mississippi from the Gulf passed it unpeiee jved, and «ruling
westward, discovered the bay of St Bernaid, now called Mata
gorddj where, penetrating a, short dwtance into the interior, he
established a military post on the bank of the Guadaloupe,
(whose rums exist to this day,) and took possession of the
country in the name of his sovereign Thedifacoveiy and the
possession were precisely such as gave title to the Mississippi,
made by the same enterpiising individual, about the same
time, and the occupation for France was attended by all the
circumstances and incidents which characterized that of St.
Louis or the Island oí Orleans It was this perfect similarity
of the muniments of title which authorized Mr Monroe and Mr
Pmekney, in 1805, to hold this emphatic language to the Spa
nish Commissioner "The facts and principles which justify
this conclusion aie so satisfactory to their Government as to
i oiivmce it that the United States have not a better right to the
Island of New Orlears, under the cession retened to, than they
have to the whole district of territory west to the Rio del
Norte "
The extent of terntoiy which should enure to the Trench
Crown, by vutue of this discovery and occupation, was deter-
mined on the east by the discovenes of La Salle on the Missis
sippi, with which those on tht St Bernard's were of cotase con-
nected On the west the extent was determined by the appli-
cation of a principle recognised by the European Poweis mak-
ing settlements m Ameuca, viz that the dividing Une should be
established at a medium distance between their various settle
ments At the period of La Salle's settlement, the nearest Spa-
nish possession was a small po^t called Panuco, at the point
where a iiver of that name falls into the bay of Tampico The
medium line between Panuco and the Guadaloupe, on which
was La Salle sfort, was the Ilio Grande del Noite, which river
was, therefoie, assumed us the tiue boundary between France
and Spain Fiance never failed to assert her claim to that
boundarj from 1685, the pellod of La Salle's discovery, up to
1762, when, by the cession of Louisiana to Spain, the countries
were unite I and the boundaries obliterated
It is thus that Mr Adams, in his conclusive lettei to Don
Onis, of Match, 1818, recapitulates the testimony in favor of the
rieich title

(1 Resala^ That tie Con* tiMmon of the I miel States
ve*=ts in Congress the power to dispose of the ten* ory beiorg
ing to thtm, and that no ti eaty pu rpi rung to abena, o any por
tion thereof is valid, without the concurrence of Congress
' 2 Resolved, That the equiva'ent proposed to be given by
Spam to th« Umted States fo* that part of Louisiana lying west
of the Sabme, was inadequate, and that it would be inexpedient
to make atransiei thereof, to any foreign power."
I shall have occasion, by and by, to advert to the assumption
for Congress of power to alienate the territory of the United
States My present purpose in quoting these resolutions, is to
show that, while the tieaty with Spam was yet pending* it was
considered as a cession of our territory The resolutions pre-
suppose the fact, and take it for granted They proceed vipoxi
the ground that a part of Louisiana was ceded, and m advoca-
ting these resolutions, their distinguished author holds this em-
phatic language
" He presumed the spectacle would not be presented of ques-
tioning, io this branch of the Government, our title to Texas,
which had been constantly maintained by the Executive for
more than fifteen years past, under three successive adminis-
trations "
He also said
" In the Florida treaty, it was not pretended that the object
was simply a declaration of where the western limit of Louisi-
ana was, it was, on the contrary, the case of an avowed cession
of territory from the Tmted States to Spam The whole of the
correspondence manifested that the respective parties to the
negotiatien were not engaged so much m an mquny where the
limit of Louisiana was, as where it should be Hence we find
vanous limits proposed and discussed * * * Finally, the
Sabine is fixed, which neither of the parties ever contended was
the ancient limit of Louisiana * * ' And the treaty itself
proclaims its purpose to be a cession of the United States to
bpain "
Such weie the opinions and ¡statements of the Senator m
18J), of whichlglai Iy avail him«eJf It is unfortunate for the
countiy, for the whole country, that Congress did not concur
with him m the declaration that it would be inexpedient to
make a transfer thereof to any foreign power, and I cannot but
trust that the wisdom and patriotism .vhich. warred Bgainst
that lash tieatv of 1819 will now be exeited to remedy its
gieat and growing evils, on the earliest opportunity, and by the
only means left, viz the reannexation ol Texas, whose trans-
fer the honorable genleman eloquently denounced as inexpe-
dient and unconstituti mal
But, Mr President, I take a higher ground than Mr Clay on
the occasion alluded to He rested the constitutional objection
upon the incompetency of the treaty making power to alienate
ttie territory of the United States I take the ground that it is
incompetent to the whole Government, thatit does not belong
to its granted powers, that its assumption is of the most alarm-
ing consequences The Constitution vests in Congress the
power to "dispose of the territory or other property of the Uni-
ted -tales" The tiue exposition of this clause is found in
the vast and wise land system adopted m pursuance of It at
the very institution of the Government Large cessions of ter-
ritory had been made hy several States to this Government, aa
pioperty, foi ceitam general purposes, and this clause of the
Constitution was inserted to give the necessary power to eflect
the obiecf of thtse giants The clause has this extent, no
moie the powei is exhausted when these purposes are accom
phshed It was ncvei dreamt that Congress could dispose of
the soveieignty oí any portion of the territory ol the United
States, and we may well imagine with what leeungs Virginia
would have contemplated t) e proposi ion to endow this Go
^ eminent wuh a powei to transfer the Northwest Tern'oiy to
Gieat Br nam or Russia The clause die5? noL discriminate
between the power of this Government to dispose cf territory
within and with iut the limits of the h ates It is grcneial, and
applies to all temtory belonging to the United Slates, wherever
iti* found—whcthei it be Point Comfort, in Vugmia, oi the
vacant landsin Arkansas, or those within the Territory of Tio
rida The power granted wi hm the States and vpithm the
Territories is identical and if one can be transferred to a fo-
reign power, both can But the protection of the Territories
agimst this wild powei of alienation is enfoi ced m every in-
stance by the hish guaranties of solemn compact Wisconsin
s protected by the terms ol cession from \irgima, Florida is
piotected by the terms of session from Spam, and Louisiana
was protected by the terms of cession from Trance They
weie ail on the same footing, under the guaianty of the same
faith—and Wiscoiibm or Honda may be alienated under the
same right
Will any one at tins time of day claim for Congiess the
power to dispose of eithei of these Temiónos to a foreign
powei1* Kit besan! that, having f uicha«ed them, we may Sell
them, the proposition is equally true of the States of Louisiana,
Aikansa , and Missoun Can we sell them, or exchange them
foi Canada? If fetich a doctrine were countenanced for a mo
ment, would any man south of the Potomac feel himself sale
from sale or exchange, while the wild fanaticism of the \boh
tionisis s hurí) mg "o laiiie a portion of our fellow ci izens upon
measuies no less  j. trav agant, and infinitely more fraught with all
those disasters that make humamt) f-huddei? \\ ill that spirit
which demands the exercise of political power for the confisca
tion of property, and shorts itself upon the \ery brink of servile
wai—wnl that spirit pause m i'i reckless career, at<?o nbviois
a measure as ihe retrocession of southern territory' The
treaty, Mr President, ot 1S19, was a great oversight on ihe part
of tne southern States We went into it blindly, 1 must say
The gieat importance of Florida, to which the public mind was
strongly awakened at that time by peculiar circi,mstance;<, led
ui ptecipiuteh into a measure by which we threw e gea*
aw a> that would have bought ten Flondas Under any circum-
stances, Florida would have been oursm a short hrae, but. our
impatience induced us to purchase it by a territory ten times
as lart,e a hundred times as fertile and to give five millions of
doMais m'o the bargain Sir, Iieeign myself to what is done,
I acquiesce m the inexorable past I propose no w-ikl and chime
ncal revolution in the established order of things, for the pui
po<!e of lemed-wng what I conceive to hwe been wrorgongi
nail y But this 1 do propose tha  we should seize the fair and
just occasion now presented to remedy the mistake which was
made in 1819 that we should repair a<- far as we can the evií
effect of a breach of 'he Constitution, that we should le e^tablibh
the mtegntv of our di^mcmoered terntory,and get back >nto our
Un'on by thenis* and honorable means' provident i\ y ofieredto
u^ th?t fair and fertile province which, m an evil hour, we se
\ered from the Confederacy
It might be supposed, Mr Pies.dcnt, from the manner m
s which the public tnmd has been máamed against my proposi-
tion, thatit had not heretofore been heard of; and that I was
startling the community with a Govel policy. Not so, sir The
farthest m the world from it For the first time, to be sure,
there is a loud and wide-spread clamor against the annexatioa
of Texas, but tfee project of effecting it £aa aotorwasiy ^
