HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Widow Glenn's, September 19, 1863-1 p.m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Thomas is heavily engaged, and Palmer and Johnson have been ordered up to support him. All goes well thus far. A considerable cavalry force have got in behind us, and are threatening some of our trains. The general commanding directs you to hurry Mitchell's cavalry in upon our right, and send a detachment to look out for our rear.

J. A. [GARFIELD],

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

General Mitchell will comply with this order at once.

By command of Major-General McCook:

FRANK J. JONES,

Captain, and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Near Crawfish Spring, September 19, 1863-1 p.m. (Received 1.20 p.m.)

Brig. General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

All the enemy apparently have left Negley's front. Johnston's and Davis' divisions are marching rapidly to Mrs. Glenn's. Sheridan's division is watering here at Crawfish Spring. I am posting it in line, so as to effectively cover Wood's right. Negley,as soon as Sheridan's line is formed, will be withdrawn from his position in front and thrown to the right and rear. I have heard nothing of the cavalry, but I am expecting it up every moment. If you want Sheridan at once I think he can move up with safety. Nothing appears to be going on in our front. I suppose the cavalry will take good care of our right rear and teams.

Very respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.

Brig. General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch reporting everything favorable is just received. Everything quiet on the right. I have taken a strong position, protecting Wood's right flank. I will withdraw Negley from his position and place him on my right and rear, a little retired. I am ready here for any emergency.

Very respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
