HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, July 20, 1863.

Colonel M. S. LANGHORNE, Lynchburg:

COLONEL:

I am greatly indebted to you and the patriotic citizens of Lynchburg for the promptness and alacrity with which my request for troops to meet the Yankee raiders was responded to night before last. It happened that their services were not needed. If they had been, I am confident they would have done honor to their city and good service to the country.

When the people throughout the country are as prompt to spring to arms on an emergency as the citizens of Lynchburg showed themselves to be on this occasion, the enemy will find their raids exceedingly unprofitable.

The damage done the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad by the party of a thousand cavalry, who rode from Charleston to Wytheville for the purpose, was, I am informed, repaired by the usual section hands on the road in less than an hour.

Very respectfully and truly, yours, &amp; c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
