ing the cost for pay alone of the officers of the
Army and clerks of the War Department and
their contingent expenses for the fiscal year
1867-68:
Pan of officers and clerks of the Army.
A statement showing the total amount of expend-
itures of the War Department for salaries of the
officers and clerks of its various branches and offi-
cers of the Army, including commutation of quarters,
fuel, forage, servants' wages and clothing, longevity
rations, and all allowances: and also the expense of
printing for the Army for the year 1867-68:
Secretary's office  159,410 00
Adjutant General's office  346,174 50
Inspector General's office  37,560 00
Quartermaster's department  2,177,456 66
Subsistence department  154,615 50
Bureau of Military Justiee  56,645 00
Chief signal officer    8,262 00

Cavalry officers...  1,187,700 00
Artillery officers  866,362 50
Infantry officers  3,638,814 00
Total S12,386.527 90
But of this vast expense of more than twelve
million dollars it will be seen that the Freed-
men's Bureau costs only for pay $840,000.
It will be observed that the grand total is
the almost incredible sum for pav only of
$12,386,527 90.
Now, Mr. Chairman, finding this to be the
condition of expenditure, I was led to examine
of what items this pay consists. I asked my
friends on the Military Committee what was
the pay of officers of the Army, and not one of
them could tell me. I asked in the Secretary's
office what it was, and no one could tell me.
I asked in the Paymaster General's office, and
no one could tell me. I asked in the Quarter-
master General's office, and no one could tell
me. I asked everywhere, and no one could tell
me until I got to the Treasury, and there my
question is at lasj;answered by putting together
jnany items in differentbureaus. Why was this 1
Because tlte pay of an officer of the Army is
made up of so many different allowances and
perquisites paid him by so many different per-
sons that no one officer can tell what the pay
of another may be. I sometimes doubt whether
any officer can rightly tell what his own pay
is. In the Treasury at last I learned what was
the pay of some of the officers of the Army.
I did not examine into the pay of the General
of the Army, because my bill, the bill of the
committee, and the bill ordered by the House
to be reported last year, agree that this office
should cease when it becomes vacant on the
4th of March next. I did not look into the
pay of the Lieutenant General, item by item,
because there is only one, and it cannot be a
great matter in so large a sum total. But I
will say that, depending on the duty and the
place to which he is assigned, the pay of a
Lieutenant General ranges from eighteen to
twenty-two thousand dollars a year.
I hold in my hand an accurate list of the re-
ceipts of a major general of the Army during
the last year, and I take one stationed at an
average costly place, and one of the younger
ones, because if stationed here, and if he were
an older one, he would get one or two thousand
dollars more per annum, as you will see when
I read this list, composed of so many items and
so many allowances, and so involved that I
doubt, indeed, whether the major general him-
self, if asked, could not tell what was his pay.
His pay proper is $220 only a month ; the rest
is made up of allowances, as seen in the sub-
joined table, showing the pay and emoluments
of a major general United States Army, head-
quarters at New York city, in 1868:
Payments made by the Paymaster's department.
Pay proper  $220 00
For self for subsistence: thirty rations per
day; commutation, thirty cents per ra-
tion, month of thirty days  270 00
For servants: four allowed, pay commuted
at sixteen dollars per month  64 00
Clothing commuted at 66 50 per month  26 00
Subsistence commuted at thirty cents,
nronth of thirty dnys  36 00
Longevity rations, live: commutation per
month of thirty days at thirty cents  45 00
Number of horses allowed, five 
Total per month of thirty days  651 00
Total per month of thirty-one days  671 20
Aggregate per annum  $>7,890 50
Payments made by the Quartermaster s department.
For quarters, &c., nine rooms, at fifteen dollars,
S135 per month, or for the year  $1,620 00
Cords.
For fuel for self for the several
months from September 1 to April
30, inclusive,eight months,at nine
cords of merchantable hard wood,
seventy-two cords, increased one
quarter on account of latitude... 90
Fuel for four servant's two thirds of
a cord for the same period, five
and one third cords,increased ono
quarter from the same cause  6!
Fuel for the remaining four months
ono cord a month, for self  4
For servants for same period, 4-12
cords 12  1J
Aggregate amount of fuel allowed
for a year 102@J}12—1,224 00
Aggregate received from quartermaster's
department  $2 S44 00
Add amount received from pay depart-
ment as above  7,890 50
Aggregate, not including forage for five
horses nor mileage  10,734 50
For forage  480 00
Aggregate when forage is commuted $11,214 50
It will be observed that he has five longevity
rations. Now, what do you suppose a longev-
ity ration is ? It is the theory of the Army
that the older a man grows the more he eats.
[Laughter.] If he has been in for five years
he gets one longevity ration ; that is a right to
thirty cents per day as long as he lives ; if for
ten years, two; and if for fifteen, three lon-
gevity rations. When does the time of this
longevity ration commence ? The hour he
enters West Point. One who has been in
West Point for four years, then graduates and
is in the Army one year, gets one longevity
ration at thirty cents a day, and it goes on as
long as he lives.
Now, this major general gets five longevity
rations only: some officers have enough, as
I will call attention to in a moment, to amount
to nineteen hundred and eighty-five or two
thousand dollars in one year. Besides he has
an amount of fuel for one year of one hundred
and two cords, which in the case of this officer
was commuted at twelve dollars a cord, making
§1,224 for fuel. The-aggregate of fuel, quar-
ters, and forage received from the quartermas-
ter's department is $2,044. Add the amount
received from the pay department $7,840 50,
and we have $10,734 50. Aggregate not in-
cluding forage for five horses and mileage,
$480 ; that makes $11,214 50. And then he
has ten cents a mile and his own and his ser-
vant's baggage carried for him besides when-
ever he moves. This is the pay and a portion
of the allowances of a major general.
Now, I have a table, which I will not read,
made up in the same way carefully, taking
everything, and I find that a brigadier general,
chief of the department, has $7,606 50 if be is
stationed at Washington ; a colonel has $4,392 ;
a lieutenant colonel, $3,826 ; a major, $3,5157 :
a mounted captain, $2,725; a captain not
mounted, $2,605; a first lieutenant mounted,
$2,177 ; a first lieutenantnotmounted, $2,137;
a second lieutenant mounted, $2,177; a sec-
ond lieutenant not mounted, $2,077. So that
a second lieutenant, just out of school, gets
$2,000 a year, and this is outside of his com-
mutation for his forage, and outside of his allow-
ance for travel.
