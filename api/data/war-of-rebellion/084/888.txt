Arkansas. I hear nothing new from that direction. The Kate Hart started for Saint Charles about daylight. I suppose the Tycoon will get off to-day. The train that left Little Rock yesterday with Indiana cavalry has just got in. It ran off the track last night.

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, August 27, 1864--6 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

CAPTAIN: Colonel Geiger left at 12 m. with a little over 600 men. I do not know the exact number, as the report which I requested has not yet got in. In regard to lime, I would like twenty barrels if you can spare it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., August 27, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff:

What is the balance of your cavalry doing, for certainly the regiment has more than 600 men? Send scouting parties to south and southwest.

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, August 27, 1864--9 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER:

One hundred and fifty enlisted men of the cavalry are on picket, not being infantry enough to relieve them. This is all the cavalry I have on any duty here. The number Colonel Geiger took appears small. I suppose it is on account of the reduced condition of the horses for lack of forage during the last three weeks. Will ascertain to-night the force I can raise for a scout.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.
