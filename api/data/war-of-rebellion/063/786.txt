HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT, Shreveport, April 23, 1864.

Major General J. G. WALKER,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am just received a dispatch from General Taylor, in which he says, "Walker's division can move to Campti with safety." In obedience to instructions from the general commanding you will move without delay to that point and report to Major-General Taylor. You should direct the chief commissary of the division to take a sufficient supply of rations from Minden to subsist the command until a supply train can reach him from Shreveport by the way of Minden. This train will leave to-day and take ten days' rations of breadstuffs and bacon. The Falls City will in the mean time be removed and supplies sent forward by boat. In regard to Colonel Jeffers' regiment, Colonel J. was ordered to establish a line of couriers from Minden to General Smith's headquarters, in Arkansas. This being done, the remainder of the regiment now with Colonel Jeffers will be at your disposal until you join General Taylor, and when advised of the fact further orders will be sent. I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a letter* from Major Thomas, chief of subsistence, to Captain Harper.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

S. S. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General WALKER,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I inclose you copies of dispatches just received from General Smith, by which it will be seen your division is to go to Arkansas instead of Campti, as you were directed in my communication of this morning. The train mentioned, with provisions mentioned in my letter of this morning, will be sent to Arkansas instead of Campti. Major Haynes reports you have five days' rations on hand. This will more than enable you to join General Smith. As the necessity of this move seems urgent, I beg, general, you will proceed on the march as rapidly as possible.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

S. S. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
