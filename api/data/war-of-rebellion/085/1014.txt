directs that you move to this point with your forces and the re-enforcements sent to you under Colonel McCray, as it is requisite that he concentrates his forces without delay. Lexington is also in our possession, but General Thompson has met a heavy force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF MISSOURI,Camp at Keiser's, on road to Lexington, October 15, 1864.

Brigadier General J. B. CLARK, Jr.:

GENERAL: General Price directs that you move your command and Colonel Jackman's at once to Brunswick, crossing the river at that place, and thence to this camp, where he will wait one day for you. It is requisite that he concentrates his command without any delay. He also directs that you bring all arms and ammunition taken, and that you afford every facility to bringing the recruits from Chariton County with you at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. A. MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-Since writing the above General Price thinks it best that you cross your force at Glasgow and come up along with General Shelby, but that you send not more than a company by way of Burnswick to escort recruits who must delay in coming. Lexington is in our possession.

Respectfully,

L. A. MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
