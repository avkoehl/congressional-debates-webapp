HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-5.10 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Received your dispatch by Captain Humphreys. I have relieved all regiments of other corps. We have driven up the enemy's right to-day along the railroad until the enemy's works were discovered, the right resting about 500 yards the other side of the railroad. It was occupied by a line which would have given way before a line of battle, but not less. Colonel Miles, commanding brigade of First Division, examined it and then retired. In General Birney's reconnaissance this morning the loss was 60 killed and wounded. This p. m. quite a number of casualties occurred in the First and Second Divisions. Reports not received. i have not yet obtained full reports of casualties in these operations. General Gibbon's official report is about 1,800, of which 600 are missing.

Major-General of Volunteers.
