Ho. of Rep<
line of seventy-four Runs, (in addition to three
previously authorized,) and also twelve frigates
of forty-four guns This legislation and appro-
priation was at a time when the nation was em-
barrnssed with a national debt of upwards of one
hundicd and twenty millions of dollars; with an
empty Tieasury, a depreciated paper cuirency;
resouices so limited that revenue for the ordinary
purposes of the Government and the maintenance
of its credit could not be raised without taxes and
loans; yet. sir, at this period, and under such
circumstances, was the Amencan Navy regarded
as an object deserv ing so much of public attention
and favor that liberal provision was made foi its
improvement and increase, by giving it a force
and power it never before had, and which should
correspond with the power, wealth, and extended
commerce of the United States.
Public opinion everywhere responded to the
sentiments of the officers of the Government in
relation to the Navy, and approbated the legisla-
tion that piovided for its increase.    This con-
tinued until a radical spirit was exhibited in this
Hail in 1820-21, under professions of reform,  i
which were not carried out, but which selected  I
for their attack the American  Navy.   Whilst
there was occasion for retrenchment in the civil
and miscellaneous expenditures of the Govern-  |
ment, these were passed by, and permitted to  |
increase-, and the legislation of Congress, uncalled
for, as I believe, by public opinion, was applied
to cut off" the one half of the annual appropuation
for the increase of the Navy, which, by an act
of Congress of 3d March, 1821, was reduced to
$500,000 annually.
The economy that withholds an appropriation
necessary to national character and defense, and
to the protection of our immense commerce, from
a desire to retain a few millions of dollars for the
time in the national Treasury, is a mistaken and
false economy, and unworthy of the foresight
and expanded views of statesmen. To save a
comparatively small sum for the time, it exposes
the nation to incalculable losses.
The unprecedented period of peace which has
been and is yet enjoyed between the great Powers
of Europe, and in which we have shared, has
enabled us to get along in our intercourse and
trade with foreign nations without conflict or
depredations on our commerce. But there is no
knowing how soon such peaceful relations in
Euiope may be distuibed. Already there are
indications of an approaching stoim there, and
when it does come we ought not to be unprepaied
in those measures of national protection and se-
curity which a state of war between othei great
commercral nations requires.
Our differences with the French Government
have awakened, within the last year, the atten-
tion of this Governmentand the American people
to the condition of our defenses. Not only has
the attention of the Government and the people
been directed recently to the condition of 0111
Navy, foitifications, and mautime fiontier, but
this condition, fiom the interest created by our
difficulties and negotiations with the French Gov-
ernment, and the publicity of their discussion,
has piobably become known to foreign Govern-
ments. Such as it is, we may now speak of it
withoutany concealment 01 disguise That con-
dition is a defenseless one, and totally unworthy
of a vigilant Government, and of the powei and
resources of the nation: fortifications, on which
large sums have been expended in paitial con-
struction, and which were, years since, deemed
of primaiy importance, are not completed, and
wheie they are constructed, they are without the
necessary armaments to make them available im-
mediately for the public service and defense, and
our limited Navy would be totally inadequate to
afford protection to oui commerce, or be efficient
in the defenses of the country against a foreign
enemy. As a war with Fiance was recently a
possible event, and in the apprehension of many
a probable one, it may be well to examine the
maritime force of that nation with which we might
have had to contend, if folly and misrule had in-
volved us in a war with it.
" From official documents, it appears that the French
navy kept in commission and active service tor 183o, was,
three ships of the line, twelve frigates, fourteen sloops of-
war, (ship rigged,) twenty-six brigs, thirty one smaller ves
seis, eighteen armed transports and storeships, and six
steam vessels , making a total of one hundred and ten ves
sel-., manned with thirteen thousand one hundred and forty-
eight men
" Ir, addition to this force, it was proposed to have
equipped ind partially in mned, in diffeient port*, ready for
any sudden emergency, two-hips of the line, three frurito--,
and three snnller vessel , manned with one thousand one
hundred and thirty five men , and a further force ready tor
lmmednte equipment, consisting ot two ship  ot the line,
three ingates, and eleven smaller vessels, making a toril,
reidy for service in three months, ol seven «hip- of the
line, eighteen frisates, and one hundred and nineteen
smaller vessel  Besides this force, their lists show that
there are now afloat the further number ot twenty two
ships-of the line, seventeen fng-ue=,M\t\ five smaller ves-
sels, ten bomb vessel-, and seventeen steim vessels Miny
ot these are undoubtedly unservieeible and unfit for repair,
but, from the best ínlormation on the subject one half, at
least, and nil of some classes, mav be considered as fit lor
service Thev have upon the stocks, now building, tvventv-
tour-hips-ol the line twenty six frigates, twontv sloops of-
war, smaller vessels, and armed transports, and seven steam
vessels. The grand total of all the vessel  which the French
nation could prepare for serv ice vv ithin twelve months, ac-
cording to their statement, is thirty -itships of the line,fifty
frigates, about one hundred and fifty sloops smiller vessels,
and armed transports, ten bomb vessels, and thirty steam
vessels "—Military and Naial Magazine, \ol IV,p 293
As I have before stated, the American Navy
consists of eighteen vessels of war in commission,
twenty in ordinary, and thnteen on the stocks;
making a total of fifty-one, manned at present by
a total of seven thousand one hundied and eighty-
nine persons, including marines.   When we con-
sidet the gieat disparity between the naval powers
of the United States and of France, we may be
well satisfied thatthey are notatthis time brought
into conflict, and that Congress was restrained
by its discretion fromacts of legislation that might
have involved the country in an unnecessary and
calamitous war.    But from this view of oui con-
I dition, we should take a lesson of instiuction for
the future, and if we regard national character
and secunty we must change that condition, and
J let us make known to the world that though our
policy and  institutions are those of peace and
amity with all nations, yet that, if war is bt ought
on us by the injustice and wrongs of any Power,
we will be found both prepaied and formidable.
This time is in every respect favorable for put-
ting ourselves in a condition to prevent and repel
wrongs.    We have an abundant Tieasuiy; are
I free from national debt or direct taxation, having
' a large annual suiplus in tiie Tieasury beyond
the reasonable and necessaiy expendituies of the
Government     Let a portion of it be applied to
improve and extend the Navy, so as to adapt it
to our incieased population, resources, and ex-
tended commerce, and let Congress also piovide
for the completion and armament of those im-
portant fortifications necessary to the protection
of oui great harbors, and which may be a lendez-
vous, shelter, and piotection for the Navy.    As
connected with the extension and protection of
our naval power, is the completion of those forti-
fications that were commenced  yeais since, on
which money has been expended, and which were
deemed  of primary impoitance     Beyond  this
class of fortifications, the repan   of others, and
the completion of defenses fur the public woiks
constructed, I am not disposed to go, and cannot
consent to support or vote for the batch of new
fortifications foi which nppropiidtions have been
|  reponed in a bill by the Committee on Military
Affans, amounting to «£,503,800 t0 begin with
A better, cheapei, and tnoie efficient defense for
1  the country than such foitifications will be found
in the increase of our naval aimament, which has
many advantages over peimanent coast fortifica-
tions, requiring an amount of money to construct
and arm, as well as men to maintain them, that
| will not be approved of oi tolerated by the peo-
ple
The navy in commission should be increased
What is now in commission is inadequate, and
I am inclined to think that the extension lecom-
memicd by the Secretary of the Navy of two
frigates and three sloops-of-wai is not enough.
Let them visit foieign seas and poits moie fie-
quently in squadrons, by winch our naval power
may be displayed, and our orneéis will have the
| opportunity of acquiring experience in the com-
mand of squadrons.  We ought not to be detened
I by the expense, when the purpose is of such ex-
, tensive national inteiest and security.   The total
I expenditures for the naval establishment from
1816 to 1834, were #63,922,574, something over
$3,000,000 a year. This includes expenditures
for docks, navy-yards, hospitals, and other pei-
manent public works connected with the Navy,
and also the materials for ship-building on hand
For the military establishment dunng the same
time, including pensions, there were expended
$124,536,570, and the total expendituies of the
Government for that period, including the pay-
ment of the national debt, were upwaids of
$467,000,000.
In the report of the Navy Commissioners it is
estimated that the amount of pay necessary for
the year 1836, for one ship-of-the-line, five frigates
of the first class, one frigate of the second class,
fourteen sloops-of-war of the first class, five
schooners, and one steam vessel, will be $1,422,-
866 41. National vessels on foreign stations at
piesent, (the ship-of-the-line Delaware has re-
turned, and is nowat Noifolk ) In the Meditei-
lanean theie are two frigates, one sloop-of-war,
and one schooner; in theWest Indies, one frigate,
four sloops, and one schooner, on the coast of
Brazil, two sloops, in the Pacific, onefngate, one
sloop, and one schooner, in the East Indies, one
sloop and one schooner. If seveial more of the
vessels in ordinary be put in commission, the in-
crease of expense will subtract but a compara-
tively small sum of some hundred thousand dol-
lars from our overflowing national Treasury.
When we consider the magnitude of our trade
that floats on the seas, of a value probably ex-
ceeding four hundred million annually, an annual
expendituie of three, four, or five millions a year
for its piotection, and to sustain the national
charactei with foreign nations, as well as to form
oui stiong arm of defense in war, when it arises,
cannot be deemed unwise oi extravagant, but as
demanded by public policy and the best interests
of the nation
A naval armament can only be formed to ad-
vantage in a season of peace, and should we, in
an unexpected war, be found without an efficient
navy, we must íemain without one, with all the
deplorable consequences of our trade destroyed,
haibors blockaded,and our coast and towns con-
tinually haiassed by the enemy. A navy is not
to be built at once, it is a work of time, and not
to be executed under the privations, exigencies,
or perils of war. The ciews that aie to sail and
fight our national ships are not to be taken at
once from oui fiesh waters, or the streets of our
cities, to trim the sails and direct the guns of a
man-of-war in the hour of battle.
It is said an army for land service can be made
effective in a few months. But that is not the
case with a navy; experience and practice are
essential to make sailois In the cmeigency of
war we may get men; but we cannot with money
purchase American sailors that can be depended
on for immediate service on board of a national
ship which is to sustain the honor and reputation
of the Ameiican flag. For the conflict of naval
battle we must have officcis that are trained and
experienced on board of oui national vessels;
they should be exeicised and accustomed to the
discipline, subordination, and command which
aie practiced theie The crews of our vessels-of-
war ought to be Ameiican citizens, and a laige
portion native Americans, who aie unsurpassed
foi their seamanship, coinage, and gunnery. But
if our naval ciews are to be collected under the
pressure of war, we must take such as can at the
moment be obtained from the meichant service,
a large poition of whom are foieigners The laws
of the United States requning the employment
of American citizens as seamen are evaded, and
more vigilance is required, both in our national
and merchant vessels, to pi event the employment
of others. When the character of the American
Navy is to be supported, it ought not to be com-
mitted to a crew made up of men of all nations,
many of whom may have hearts as foreign to
our cause as the places of their nativity. I hope
that the resolution submitted by the honorable
mi mbei from Maryland, [Mr.McKiM,] íequirimj
meichant vessels of a ceitain tonnage to receive
and employ a ceitain number of boys to be
trained in the science of navigation, may lead to
legislation on the subject

the improvement, increase, and preservation of
