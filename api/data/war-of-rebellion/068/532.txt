HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Todd's Tavern, May 8, 1864-1.10 p.m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I have detailed the Fifty-second New York Volunteers to escort the wounded to Fredericksburg, and the regiments is probably near your headquarters now. The commanding officer is Captain Wright, a very reliable officer. The commanding officer of the Twenty-second New York Cavalry ranks him, but his regiment certainly did not act well this morning, and he appeared stupid. It would be well if Captain Wright could have charge of the whole force. The Fifty-seventh New York Regiment was selected on account of its heavy losses day before yesterday, lieutenant-colonel commanding being killed.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

The Twenty-second New York Cavalry will soon be on the road for Piney Branch Church.

General MEADE:

The following note just received from General Warren. I have directed Gibbon's division of infantry to report to him without delay. Gibbon is getting ready, and will proceed at once. I have no ammunition besides that in the cartridge-boxes.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.

MAY 8, 1864.

General HANCOCK:

Send me down a good division. I am out of ammunition; send some if you have it. I find myself, after much success, in a position without a division I had expected, and fear I cannot do much more if I am attacked. Longstreet at least is in my front and Lee's cavalry on his flank. I have none. General Robinson is badly wounded; Colonel Ryan is killed, Robinson's division. Send me help if you are not pressed.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,Todd's Tavern, May 8, 1864-12.25 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your courier has arrived. My command is nearly all in. I am ordered to hold myself in readiness to support you, should it be necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
