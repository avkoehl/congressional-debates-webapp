leaking.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state
who has been allowed to come in.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. The gentleman from
West Virginia seems to have dropped from
some quarter.
Mr. WjtlALEY. In reply I will say I was
here when the roll was called and answered to
my name, and if the Clerk did not hear me I
cannot help it.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk did not hear
the gentleman's answer.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Has the Doorkeeper the
right to let members in upon their own state-
ment?
The SPEAKER. The -Chair will state to
the gentleman from Wisconsin that the Door-
keeper always requires every member to an-
swer whether he answered to his name on the
call of the House, and when they answer they
did he allows them to enter the House.
The Chair will also state that during the
pendency of a call of the House permission is
uniformly given to members on their parole to
be absent for a few moments.
Mr. WENTWORTH. I demand that the
Sergeant-at-Arms shall enforce the warrant of
the House.
The SPEAKER. The Clerks are preparing
the warrant.
Mr. RADFORD moved the House adjourn.
Mr. PAINE called for the yeas and nays.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania, demanded
tellers.
Tellers were not ordered; and the yeas and
nays were not ordered.
The House refused to adjourn.
The Sergeant-at-Arms appeared at the bar
of the House, and reported he had under the
warrant of the House now in custody Mr. Per-
ham and Mr. Eckley.
The SPEAKER. Mr. Perham, you have
been absent from the House without its leave.
What excuse have you to offer therefor?
Mr. PERHAM. 1 telt in need of my din-
ner and went home and procured it. The only
complaint I have to make is, that when I re-
turned I was kept waiting for a long time
before I could get in.
Mr. BINGHAM. I move the gentleman be
excused.
Mr. RADFORD. On the payment of costs.
The amendment was agreed to ; and the
motion, as amended, was adopted.
The SPEAKER. Mr. Eckley, you have
been absent without leave of the House. What
excuse have you to make ?
Mr. ECKLEY. When I left the House I
was under the impression it was about to ad-
journ. That impression I received from the
action of those who had charge of the till.
Like the gentleman from Maine, I felt much
in need of my dinner for the sustenance of the
inner man, and after getting it I returned here
and had to wait for a long time before I was
allowed to come in.
I was absent without leave of the House, for
which I beg its pardon. I did not mean any
disrespect to the House.
Mr. SPALDING moved his colleague be
excused on payment of costs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BINGHAM moved that the House
adjourn.
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. BINGHAM. My colleague, Mr. Le
Blond, desired to be heard on this question,
and I move he be heard for ten minutes.
Mr. LE BLOND. I did not ask to be heard
upon this bill, but on the one reported by the
chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. BINGHAM. I was mistaken then, and
apologize to my colleague.
Mr. RADFORD. I hope gentlemen on the
other side will be willing to make some com-
promise, and fix an hour when the vote shall
be taken.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. I object
to any compromise.
Mr. BINGHAM. I move that all further
proceedings under the call be dispensed with.
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. In con-
sideration of the attention and devotedness of
the members present, I move they shall be
allowed a recess of five minutes.
The SPEAKER. That would dispense with
the proceedings under the call.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. It does
not seem to be the wish of the House, and I
withdraw it.
Mr. RAlJFORD. I ask for leave of absence.
Mr. SPALDING. I object.
The Sergeant-at-Arms appeared at the bar
of the House, and reported that, in compliance
with its warrant, he had now in custody Mr.
Delano and Mr. Buckland.
The SPEAKER. Mr. Delano, you have
been absent from the House without its leave.
What excuse have you to offer?
Mr. DELANO. I went home, got my din-
ner, and returned as soon as I could.
Mr. HUBBARD; of .Connecticut. Was the
gentleman arrested?
Mr. DELANO. I came back voluntarily and
hunted up the Sergeant-at-Arms. [Laughter.]
Mr. MILLER. I move the gentleman be
excused on payment of the usual fees.
The motion was agreed to.
The SPEAKER. Mr. Buckland, you have
been absent without leave of the House. What
excuse have you to offer ?
Mr. BUCKLAND. My only excuse is I
went to get my dinner.
Mr. RADFORD. I move the gentleman be
excused on the payment of fees.
Mr. SCHENCK. If the gentleman procured
his dinner at the restaurant below stairs it must
have been so miserable a one that I am quite
sure it was punishment enough. [Laughter.]
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ROGERS. I move each one of the
members be furnished with a ham sandwich at
the expense of the House.
Mr. HOGAN. To be paid out of the con-
tingent fund.
The SPEAKER. As it involves an appro-
priation it must be first considered in the
Committee of the Whole. [Laughter.]
Mr. BOYER. I move the House adjourn.
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I wish to present a
motion, and to explain it I ask the Clerk to
read the paper I send up.
The Clerk read as follows:
The common understanding of the reason why a
State forfeits State rights by its hostility to the United
States, as evidenced by the adoption of an ordinance
of secession 
Mr. COOPER. I object to any further
reading.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I move all further pro-
ceedings under the call be dispensed with. <
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. INGERSOLL. I move that I shall be
excused from further attendance on this day's
session of the House; and I ask a paper to be
read in support of that motion.
Mr. SPALDING. Is it a physician's cer-
tificate?
Mr. INGERSOLL. I rise to ask a question
of the Chair as to the right of a member to
deny me the privilege of being heard on a
question of this kind. I ask the House 10 ex-
cuse me. I may have the best reasons in the
world, and yet gentlemen deny me the privi-
lege of giving them. Now, is that parlia-
mentary ?
