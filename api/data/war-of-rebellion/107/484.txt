CAMP LOOKOUT, September 20, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Camp Scott:

GENERAL: Everything is quiet both here and in the vicinity of our advance guard. Our men at the fomrer ferry near Hamilton's were fired on last night. I had only two cavalrymen there, watching the other side, from which the shots came. I have sent a company of infantry there to-day to examine the matter. There was a rumor of some little force on the other side. It is probably some small body retreating from below and trying the ferry to find a mode of communication with Floyd and Wise. I should like to start a regiment acquainted with the country at mouth of Paint Creek, and let them sweep the whole territory to Raleigh Court-House and Fayette, meeting us at Lewisburg or some other point in advance. I suspect a secret trade in salt and beef-cattle with the enemy in the counties between the Kanawha and Wytheville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAMP LOOKOUT, September 20, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

Major Hines is at top of Sewell. The enemy had made some fortifications there, but left only yesterday. McCook's brigade will go forward six miles in the morning, so as better to support Hines, who thinks their rear guard still within reach. The position on top of Sewell is a strong one, and I wish to occupy it at once with the advance guard at least, and move up myself as soon as the transportation will permit, lest the enemy should be encouraged to return. I have sent Captain Lane's company to Gauley, as per order. The Thirty-fourth Ohio, Colonel Piatt, is at Camp Enyart, Witcher's Creek, waiting for transportation. I propose to order the First Kentucky to scout the country south of the river while the Thirty-fourth is waiting for the wagons.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SEPTEMBER 20, 1861.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Camp Lookout:

Major Hines' report makes me think a report we started yesterday worked well. It was stated that we intended to cross Hughes' Ferry if Gauley ran blood. Three companies of the Twelfth and 600 men of the Thirteenth did cross over and go up that road nine miles. The birds had all flown, but the effocts of the scout have been salutary. As to your advance under my former instructions as to care about position, you are authorized to do so. Let the advanced guard on Sewell examine and choose a strongly defensible position, and allow no passings whatever.

W. S. ROSECRANS.
