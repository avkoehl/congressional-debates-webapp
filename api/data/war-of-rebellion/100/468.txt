Your dispatch of this date, stating that the steam-boat Governor Troup has been sent by you to the Altamaha, has been received. The major-general commanding directs me to say in reply that after you had received his telegram about the Troup you should have reported to him and asked direct instructions before making a different disposition of that boat. At the Troup has been sent to the Altamaha she will remain there until further orders.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Department of the South:

I have received yours with regard to the Troup. Lieutenant Woodruff saw me after the receipt of General Gillmore's dispatch and said it was specially agreed between himself and the general that the Troup should go up the Altamaha. Also, that it would greatly facilitate his operations for him to do so. It was in consequence of the express statement as above that the Troup was allowed to go up the Altamaha.

General GILLMORE:

Yours received at 10 p. m. Necessary orders will be given to-night with regard to the movement. I think I can have Molineux's brigade at Augusta by the evening of the 16th. Is it of great importance that it should reach Augusta on the evening of the 16th? If not, and we could be allowed till the evening of the 17th to get the brigade there, it might save forced marches.

C. GROVER,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
