General Johnston directs me to inform you that notice has been received from the enemy of the termination of the truce in forty-eight hours, from 11 a. m. yesterday. He desires you will hold your command in readiness to move, and cause the roads leading from Haywood toward Salisbury and Charlotte to be carefully observed.

AUGUSTA, April 25, 1865.

Mrs. DAVIS:

MADAM: Herewith I send dispatch just received. I have as yet received no information as to the nature or extent of the negotiations under the turce; therefore cannot conjecture as to the result, but I have little hope of any good. The news from the west is not good. Alabama seems to be completely overrun. The force of the enemy now at Macon is about 8,000, and will probably move against this place at the termination of the truce.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. D. FRY.

CHARLOTTE, April 20, 1865.

Mrs. JEFFERSON DAVIS:

(Care General Fry.)

We arrived here yesterday evening and may remain a few days longer. Are all well. The President is very well and comfortably provided for. This place occupied by large force and is perfectly secure. A general suspension of hostilities has been agreed on. The negotiations were carried on by Breckinridge, Reagan, and General Johnston,
