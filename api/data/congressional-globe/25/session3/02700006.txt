Report of the Secretary oj the Navy.
Senate ¡k Ho. of Reps.
Commodore Alexander J   Dallas, consisted  of
ore frigate, five sloops of wai, and one small ves
sel    Ihe fugate and one of the sloops having
recently íetuined to Bosto" for repairs, it is con
templateu to send another ft ¡gate, and to increase
the number of sloops of war on that station to
seven    The force will then be composed of one
frigate, seven sloops of war, and one small vessel
As the blockade of ihe Mexican ports, by the
French squadron cont naesto bestuctly enfoiced,
and as indication's of a ¡evolutionary spirit have
lately been exhibited at lampico,   t is believed
that, under existing circumstances, as well as in
view of future contingencies, no reduction of the
proposed force can be piudently made
A frigate and sloop of war, which, as stated in
the last annual report of the Secretary of the
Navy, were then pieparing for a cruise in the
Indian seas, under Commodoie Geoige G Reíd,
sailed from Norfolk on the bth of May last i5y

the 28th of July, he had reiched Rio de Janeiro,
from whence he was to depart the next day
Having reason to believe it would conduce, o the
protection and safety of oui citizens, xnd < jimieice
n those remote regions, I have direcie I the e ves
seis to visit the Sandwich and Society Island* on
then way home
That the officers employed on these various
services have performed then duties with equal
activity, vigilance, and piudence, is su lioieiitly
evidenced by the fact, that notwi hstnnding the
wais and revolutions which still agitate so gieat
a petition of the South A menean States boidenng
on the Pacific, and the long protracted blockade
of the poits oí Mexico and of Buenos Ayies, the
peisons and piopeity of citizens of the United
States have, in no case which has come to the
knowledge of this Department, sustained outrage
or wrong, while, on the other hand, nothing has
occurred thioughout the whole of out mtercomse
or interposition todistuibthe relatione of peace
between us and the paities in collision with each
other

tress Under th s law toe bloc p of war Lne, the
brigs Pioneer and Consott, the schoonei Active,
and the steamship Pulton, were occisionally em
ployed with beneficial results Owing to the want
of proper * essels at the disposal of this Depart
ment after supplying the necessities of foieign sta
tions, the steamship Fulton is the only one now
available for this seivice
To aid in making the genera! survey of the
coast of the United States, Lieutenants Gednev
and Blake, wuh other naval ifficers, weie, on the
app.tca innoftheSeciettryofthe Preasuiy,placed

folded as circumstances permitted
The survey of toe southern coast, from Tybee
bar to Hunting Island, May river, as directed by
the act of Congress of March 3, 1837, has been
co npleted by Lieutenant Wilkes, a copy of whose
repoit will be communicated to Congress early m
the approaching session The surveys of the har-
bois of Beaufort and Wilmington, North Carolina,
provided for by the same act, will be commenced
forthwith byLieutenantGlynn,of the Navy, and
it is expected will be completed in time to be com
I mumcated to Congi ess previous to its adjournment
I The delay in curving this act into execution
has amen from a want of pioper vessels for that
service, which will now be performed m a steam
I vessel loaned by the Wai Department The at-
tention of Lieutenant Glynn «ill also be directed
to an examination of the coast between the mouths
of the Vli sissipfi and Sabme rivers, as directed
by the act of 7th July, 1838
Under the piovisions ot the act of Congress of
the 2b h June last, and the supplementary act of
the 9th July following, authorising the appomt-
j ment of three competent persons to test the various

States
The state of the Navy pension fund is as foi-
I lows                                                                               I

The amount of stocks owned by the
Navy pension fund on the 3J of
1     March, 1837, was             .....4,1,11<>,329 53

which was sold, and the proceeds of the sale,
with the mtei est and dividend of the capital, were
applied to the payment of pensions and aireáis of
pensions Of the balance of stock, $310 832 25,
owned by the fund 1st of Octobei, 183b, the nom
mal amount of $97,469 16 has been directed to be
sold to meet payments on the 1st of January,
1839, so that the actual capital of the fund for the
year 183J will be only £,293,303 09
It will thus be seen that undet the operation of
successive pension laws, each widening and ex
tending the streamof public munificence, this fund
is rapidly decreasing, insomuch that in the couise
of a very few years large appropriations will be
requned to redeem the faith of Congiess pledged
for its support
PRIV 4TEEE PENSION FUND,
The number of privateer pensioners is thirty-
six The annual amount required to pay them is
j? 862 No payments were made to these pen-
sioners during the past year, as the privateer pen-
sion fund had been exhausted
This fund, it will be perceived, failed in 1836,
and, consequently, no payments have been made
since that time The subject was brought to the
nonce of the President m former reports from this
Department, and I have only to add, that as, in.
conformity with the law establishing and appro-
priating this fund, the certificates of pensions were
granted during life, it would appear that the nation
stands pledged to furnish the means of fulfilling the
obligation

The construction of a dry dock at some point
in the harbor of New Yoik, has been heretofore
¡epeatedly recommended by this Department, and
is every yeai becoming moie necessary to thepur-
poses of the Navy Whatever diversity of opin-
ion may exist as to the most eligible site, all seem
to unite in favor of the object The two docks at
Norfolk and Boston are entirely insufficient to
meet the requirements of the service, delays m
repairing ships, at all times injurious, and in time
of wai dangeious to the interests and safety of the
country, frequently occur in consequence of their
being no vacant dock to receive them, and at this
moment two line of battle ships aie lying at New
\oik in a decayed and rapidly decaying state,
which can neither be repaired w here they are, nor
íemoved elsewheie for that puipose without great
risk ind expense
The subjec of a naval academy has also been
moie than once piesented for consideiatton Such
an institution is earnestly desired by the officer's
of the Navy, and it is believed would greatly con-
duce to the benefit of the service generally The
piopnety of affording young midshipmen the
means and opportunity for the acquisition of that
knowledge and those sciences which are either
absolutely necessary, or highly useful to their
piofession, would seem to have been recognized
by Congress in the liberal provision for teachers
and professors of mathematics, on board our ships
of war and at the pnncipal navy-yards Those,
however, who have had the best opportunities for
oUeivmg the piactical operation oí this system,
ai e of opinion that it does not answei the purposes
f)i which it was intended,and that other and more
effectual means aie required. A naval academy
wiiuh should combine the acquisition of those
sciences, and that knowledge without which pio-
fessnnal duties cannot be performed to the public
satisfaction, with that practical experience which
is, if possible, still moie indispensable, would, in
my opinion, add little to the expense of the pres
ent defective system, and be followed by benefits
which would far more than repay the cost of such
an establishment
The attention of the Piesident and Congress ¡s
also solicited to that part of the estimates of the
Boaid of Navy Commissioners which contem-
plates the building of five brigs or schooners, the
frames of which have been collected under the
law for the gradual improvement of the Navy, and
wmch are requned for dispatch vessels, surveys,
and other puiposes
It is presumed that no arguments are necessary
to enfoice the propriety of retaining a sufficient
number of ships in comm «sion to afford active sea
service to the officers of the Navy Such service
is manifestly essential to d sciplme,to expenence,
and to those habits of haidinood without which no
officer can adequately fulfill his duty The same
piactical expenence necessaiy to eminence m any
