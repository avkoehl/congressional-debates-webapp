Major General J. F. GILMER,

Chief Engineer, Richmond, Va.:

General Lee, having moved his headquarters from here, it is probable Colonel Stevens will soon follow him; hence Colonel Harris, whose health, moreover, is not very good, cannot be spared for Mobile. Should General Lee not require Colonel Stevens he could be sent to that locality.
