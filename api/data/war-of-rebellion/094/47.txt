Henry E. Noyes, Second U. S. Cavalry, to be assistant inspector-general, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; Captain Elias B. Carling, assistant quartermaster, to be chief quartermaster, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel; Captain J. C. Read, commissary of subsistence of volunteers, to be chief commissary of subsistence, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, to date from December 4, 1864. These appointments, with the exception of the last, should be made to date from the 24th of October, 1864, the officers having performed their duties since that time.

I have also to request that First Lieutenant John N. Andrews, Eighth U. S. Infantry, may be appointed as an aide-de-camp on my personal staff, with the rank of major, to date from October 5, the date of my appointment to duty as a major-general by brevet. I hope the full staff may be allowed, as my command is extensive and demands all the activity and zeal the officers are capable of giving.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,
