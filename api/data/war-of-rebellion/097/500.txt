this and from the prisoners that their line was still held in force and by Mahone's division the troops were directed to withdraw. The enemy followed with a strong line of infantry to their picket-line, which they reoccupied. List of casualties not yet known.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

Major-General HARTSUFF:

I have ordered a brigade of about 1,500 men to move on your side of the James near the Varina bridge so that either you or I can use it as required. If you are ordered to assault you use it.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

BERMUDA FRONT, April 2, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

Do you know whether General Grant thought the enemy might break through our line to cross Appomattox and overwhelm Parke, and if not, in what way vigilance on your part can prevent their crossing in rear of their own line for that purpose, or does he mean that they may withdraw troops in front of our line and send them across? Please give me your understanding of it. It is absolutely impossible to determine whether they withdraw their line, except by the means I employed this morning, which are rather costly; they cannot be made to expend their fire on anything outside their picket-lines. That and every observable point I have constantly and thoroughly watched, and I think our vigilance and the demonstration this a.m. will keep them in their line here, which it would be madness for them to abandon or jeopardize.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.
