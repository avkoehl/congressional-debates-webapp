I hoped to be able to visit you soon, but I fear that I amy not be able to do so. If, however, you feel at liberty to go to Richmond, and will telegraph me, I will try and meet you, unless the enemy becomes more enterprising than he has been recently.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.

N. B.-Please send me the 1,500 saddles and bridles that you say that you can spare. Spurs with them if possible.

RICHMOND, VA., March 4, 1864.

General J. LONGSTREET,

Greeville, Tenn.;

Your letter of 45th February received. Your assignment of General Buckner to Hood's old division not approved. The order from this office assigning General Field to that division will be carried into effect.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

GREENVILLE, Macon 4, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Would it meet the views of the Department to assign Major-General Field to the division formerly command by Major-General McLaws?

J. LONGSTREET.

RICHMOND, VA., March 4, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET:

It does not suit the views of the President to assign Major-General Field to the division lately commanded by Major-General McLaws. He is to take the division to which he was assigned in orders from this office.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, March 4, 1864.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,Dalton, Ga.:

Soldiers just returned from Middle Tennessee report that troops have gone back in great force from jour front into Kentucky to meet and expected advance of mine into that State. Have you any information corroborative of this.

J. LONGSTREET.
