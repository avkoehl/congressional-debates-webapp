ARTILLERY HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

January 13, 1865.

Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel S. F. BARSTOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

COLONEL: I respectfully recommend that the batteries applied for by General Wright, in his letter of the 3rd of January, be returned to this army. We have now forty-two batteries, including horse artillery (228 guns). Many of these batteries have been carried up from four to six guns to furnish artillery for the forts on our lines, and some of them are too weak in men to take that number of guns into the field. It is preferable, whatever number of guns is decided upon as the proportion to the troops, to organize as four-gun batteries all such as have not the maximum of men allowed to a battery, and to send the "attached" infantrymen back to their commands. For a given number of guns, the greater the number of batteries the more efficiently will they be manned and the less will they draw upon the other arms. The batteries are lying in Washington, where I understand there is an excess of artillery unemployed.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.
