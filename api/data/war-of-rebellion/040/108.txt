Brigadier General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The accompanying dispatch just received from Pleasonton. His brilliant dash and rapid movements will undoubtedly immortalize him!

8 A. M.-In position at Aquia Church.

It is fair to presume that he failed to receive your orders to push on, otherwise I cannot account for his movements at all. I sent him a dispatch, of which I inclose a copy [following]. General Couch has been ordered to withdraw his infantry.

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding, Aquia Church:

I don't know what you are doing there. Orders were sent you at 11 p. m. last night, by telegraph and orderlies, to push for the enemy without delay, and to communicate with General Stoneman at Hartwood. The enemy have recrossed the river, at Kelly's Ford probably, and Averell is pursuing them. Get your orders from Stoneman.

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

February 26, 1863.

Captain C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

There is no evidence of any enemy in front in force. For two nights past signals have been observed in the passes and along Bull Run Mountains, indicating an enemy. Bull Run is high, and, so far as this brigade is concerned, the general commanding need have no apprehensions. Refugees come in daily in numbers, and are questioned only so far as regards our own defense, and then sent to provost-marshal in Alexandria.

Hampton's command was at Culpeper, but relieved by Fitzhugh Lee, and ordered to concentrate at Kelly's Ford, on the Rappahannock. The Rappahannock Bridge has been rebuilt, and is strongly protected by artillery.

ALEX. HAYS,

Brigadier-General.
