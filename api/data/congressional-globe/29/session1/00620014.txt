EHE CONGRESSIONAL â–  GLOBE.
Dec. 8,
Itttion and amendment. They were read accord-
ingly. .
He also sent up,-to- be read at the Clerk s
table, a pamphlet, purporting to be ap'Offer on
the part of some individual or individuals to ex-
ecute the -printing of Congress at tweaty-fivs or
thirty-three-and one third per cent, reduction
from the present rates.
Some moments wer.e occupied in the. reading;
and, it not being concluded,
.< Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi,objected to
the further reading, as all the members of- the
House, he presumed, had had it laid upon, their
desks.'
Mr. DA VIS insisted upon its reading, and that
the gentleman's objection, in order to be effect-
ual, should have been made-before the reading
commenced.
Mr. THOMPSON then moved to suspend the
reading of the.paper.
Mr. DAVIS thereupon said that he would not
insist on having the rest of it read, inasmuch, as
the offer had been stated. He would now offer a
few words in reply to the speech of the honorable
gentleman from Virginia, [M*V Bayly.] That
honorable gentleman was, he believed, a politician
of the strict construction school, and. hewould do
the gentleman the justice to adtXHl'that in general
he adhered with great strictness and tenacity to
the'faith. Now, he would ask that gentleman to
say whether he wanted a Government press as an
appendage to the Government of the United
States? Under whatclause of the Constitution,
or under which of the resolutions;of 1798, did he
find the authority for such an adjunct? The
gentleman, he had no doubt, had adopted his
political principles in good faith, and professed
them with perfect candor and full belief, and in
Ins general course went for carrying them out
into action; but he would ask the gentleman
whether, in the present instance, he was not a
hide departing1 from his own creed ?
Mr. McDOWELL here interposed to ask the
floor for a moment to make a report.
And the floor having been yielded by Mr.
Davis for that purpose,
Mr. McDOWELL, from the joint committee
uppointed to wait on the President of the United
States and inform him that Congress had assem-
bled, that a quorum has been formed in each
House, and that Congress is ready to receive any
communication he may be pleased to make, re-
ported that the joint committee had discharged
the duties assigned, it, and that the President
would make a communication to the two Houses
of Congress forthwith.
Mr. DAVIS resumed. He would again turn
to the gentleman from Virginia, and would ask
him to review his principles, and look at the con-
sistency of throwing his acknowledged ability
and influence in favor of fixing on the Govern-
ment a Government press. The gentleman rep-
resented Accomac. Could the House forget that
the gentleman's predecessor (Mr. Wise) had
been a leader m pressing on the very object pro-
posed to be effected by the amendment? Yes,
that gentleman's "illustrious predecessor" was
the first man Mr. Davis had ever heard raise his
voice in favorof separating the Governmentfrom
the political press of the country.
RECEPTION OF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Here Mr. Davis was interrupted by the ap-
pearance at the bar of the President's Private
Secretary with the annual executive message,
which was received and read.
The reading of the message (which consumed
an hour and fifty minutes) having been con-
cluded,
Mr. CHAPMAN, of Alabama, moved that the
message do lie on the tabic, and that the usual
number of copies thereof be printed.
IVlr. CHAPMAN also moved the previous
question.
Mr. BflODHEAD sent to the table to have
read the following resolution:
Itcsokcd, That the message of the President of the
United !?uto> be referied to tiie Committee ot the Whole
on the state of the Union, and that fifteen thousand copies
with and twenty thousand without the accompanying
document^ be printed for the use of the House, and that
the punting lit* done by the printers to be hereafter
elected.
Mi. CHAPMAN accepted this as a modifica-
tion of his motirn; and
Th   pu'vious q>iHsuon was then seconded, put,
and carried; and, under its; operation the resolu-
tion submitted by Mr. Brobhead, and accepted
by Mr. Chaeman as a modification of his motion,
was -agreed to.
, PUBLIC PEINTEK.
The SPEAKER then announced that the ques-
tion recurred oh the motion of Mr. Bayly, that
the House proceed to the' election of Public
Printer, and on the amendment thereto proposed
by Mr. Garrett Dayis, which were under con-
sideration when the message of the'President was
received.
Mr. G. DAVIS, who was entitled to the floor,
said that at this late hour of the day (it was three

House adjourn.
And thereupon the House adjourned.

lution, which he sent to the table.
Mr. DAVIS said he would do so if it would
occasion no debate, and lie did not lose his right
to the floor.
Several members objected to the introduction of
the resolution out of regular order.

he did not forfeit his right to the floor.

agreement between members as to the coorse of

The SPEAKER. If the genteman from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Davis] yields to his colleague for

j degree of inconsistency in the effort he was
i now making to purify to some degree the pub-
, lie press of the country by separating it from
; all connection with tiie patronage of the Gov-
i ernment, and to have the printing of Congress
| executed at as low rates as practicable; and the
, gentleman had seen proper to stigmatize Mr.
; Davis's earnestness in behalf of these objects
