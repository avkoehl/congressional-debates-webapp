REMARKS. - The above is as reported by brigade commanders. It cannot be relied on as being strictly accurate, as the prisoners, being sent back to the rear in small squads, with little note having been taken of them, they may have been counted more than once by different parties.

Major-General.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 25, 1865.

General R. E. LEE:

Not the Twenty-ninth but the Twenty-fifth Corps, said by our scouts to be negroes. The returns of yesterday show our effective infantry to be 13,900.

Captain J. M. ROBINSON,

Raleigh, N. C.:

General Johnston directs you remove supplies on Goldsborough and Weldon and Raleigh and Gaston Railroads as fast as possible with your trains. General Hampton will be instructed to put small cavalry force in observation north of Goldsborough. Acknowledge.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RALEIGH, March 25, 1865.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON:

I am using every exertion with all except North Carolina Railroad engines to move to Raleigh supplies now accumulated at Tarborough and Weldon, and which are coming in daily from the country to those depots. Do you mean your telegram merely to stimulate my exertions, or do you wish me to use supplies coming to Tarborough, Weldon, and other depots and remove rapidly what is already accumulated? There is already at depots more than can be moved in five days. The North Carolina engines can stop hauling to Greensbrough, in whole or in part, and aid in removing to Raleigh. Or do you wish me to move at once all valuable engines, shop machinery, and cars from Eastern North Carolina to save equipments abandoned in that section; and if so, am I to move all, or risk what is necessary to supply W. H. F. Lee's cavalry at Stony Creek?

JOHN M. ROBINSON.
