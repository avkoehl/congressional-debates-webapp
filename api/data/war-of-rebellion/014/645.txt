HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, July 19, 1862.

Captain A. L. RIVES, Acting Chief of Engineer Bureau:

CAPTAIN: The point you state you have selected seems to be favorable, provided the approaches to it are not too difficult. Of this you can judge better than myself. If examination of the approaches proves the ground favorable the bridge should be constructed immediately. I am pleased to learn that you are progressing in the arrangement for the bridge at Belle Isle.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,

General.
