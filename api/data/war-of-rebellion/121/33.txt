J. F. HUNTINGTON,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. C. S. MIL. PRISONS EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Columbia, S. C., January 6, 1865.

Brigadier General W. M. GARDNER, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: The letter of Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Smith, of December 26, 1864, with your indorsement, has this day been received. I fear it will be impossible to get what he calls old regular troops. The same difficulty occurs at all the prisons, and if we can get reserves, or any other troops, we must be satisfied and do the best we can with them. I regret to see the spirit of discontent manifested in the letter. Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, because he cannot get what he wants, asks to be relieved from the command, and that some one be ordered to relieve him who ranks Colonel Henry. General Orders, Numbers 84, provide for all difficulties arising from the officer in command of troops ranking the officer commanding the prisoners. You will please call attention to that order, and direct both Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Smith to govern themselves by it. The want of provisions is a serious matter, which will, I think, require the removal of the prisoners from Danville. I have now a communication before the Department which I am in daily expectation to hear from. As soon as I do I shall then be prepared to take the necessary steps to remove the prisoners if necessary.

In the meantime inform Lieutenant-Colonel Smith that I cannot apply to have him relieved from this command. He must do as other commanders of prisons have done and are still doing; that is,to make the best use he can of the means at his command. Relieving him would not remedy the evil; it would only throw it on somebody else.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

RICHMOND, January 7, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Some time ago Johnson S. Palmer, an inoffensive citizen of Loudoun County, Va., was tried by some sort of a Federal tribunal and sentenced to the penitentiary at Albany. Mr. Palmer's offense, it seems, was that he carried cattle and other articles from his county to Richmond for sale. now notify you that one Charles Thompson, who for some time past has been a citizen prisoner, has this day been put in the penitentiary at Richmond in retaliation. When Mr. Palmer is released Mr. Thompson will be discharged.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
