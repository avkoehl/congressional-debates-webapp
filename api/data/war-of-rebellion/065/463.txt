case of an assult. Cummings states that when he was last on duty there ten days ago, he saw four guns lying in the fort, which he was told were to be mounted in the casemates on the Sullivan's Island side. They looked like 24 s or 32s. Many of the casemates are entirely crushed in, others are good. The men serving in Sumter get coffee. A moderate supply of hard bread is kept in the bomb-proofs. Occasionally fresh beef, cooked, is brought down from Cahrleston. The new iron-clad which has lately made her appearance is called the Charleston, and is built after the model of the Atlanta. One of these deserters, Crowley, states that he was in Battery Wagner when our troops assaulted i on the 18th of July, and that it was with great difficulty that the garrison could be kept from the bomb-proofs. They state that Colonel Shaw, Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, was killed on he paprapet, but there is difference of opinion as to where he was buried. They state that the colored soldiers who were captured wre treated as prisoners of war, the same as the white soldiers.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. H. DAVIS,

Colonel 104th Pennsylvania Volunteers, Commanding Post.
