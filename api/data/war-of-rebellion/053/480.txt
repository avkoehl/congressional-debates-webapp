Received orders by telegraph, dated Washington, D. C., October 18, to relieve Major-General Rosecrans, in command of the Department of the Cumberland.

ON PICKET-LINE, October 19, 1863-5 p.m.

[ColonelCHARLES G. HARKER,

Comdg. Third Brig., Second Div., Fourth Army Corps:]

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the rebels, for the last two hours, have been more friendly than seems desirable in time of war. Commencing at about 300 yards from the "tannery," the rebels have been advancing their pickets to the bank of the creek, and now lie on the opposite side for quite a distance down the stream. Some walk up and down the bank without arms, and others have them over their shoulders in quite a careless manner, being within 25 yards of our sentries.

Persons having the appearance of officers figure conspicuously. I have been down watching them, at this short distance, for some time.

One asked, "Have you any papers? We have not had any for a long time." "No." "Don't you allow talking?" "No."
