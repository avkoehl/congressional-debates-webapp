THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

others as little manufactured as the nature
of mutual commerce will allow." I propose
to apply this principle of political economy
to our ruinous policy of exporting annually
$200,000,000 worth of raw cotton, instead of
exporting it' in the form of yarn, increased
in its exchangeable value in the markets of the
world to $400,000,000.
To the vast importance of this subject the
South is directing its attention, and to it I
in vite the careful consideration ofthe committee.
To encourage the manufacture of cotton into
yarn in the neighborhood of the fields where it
is grown I propose, unless an amendment shall
be offered by the Committee of Ways and
Means covering the point, to mqve at the proper
time the adoption of the following amendment *.
To add to tho free list "machinery manufactured
expressly tor spinning cotton into yarn may be im-
ported free of duty for twelve months from the pas-
sage of this act; provided, that this exemption shall
bo limited to the importation lor any one manufactory
of no more machinery than h necessary to operate
10,000 spindles."
In offering this amendment I am cheerfully
complying with the wishes of the General
Assembly of the State of Alabama, which at
its last session passed unanimously a memorial
to Congress, which 1 had the honor to intro-
duce here and ask its reference to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and which I hope
the Clerk will do me the favor to read.
The Clerk read as follows:
A joint memorial to the Congress of tho United
States.
To the Honorable the Senate and Home of U^prcacnt-
utives ofthe United Stales of America :
Your memorialists, the senate and house of rep-
resentatives of the Slate of Alabama, respectfully
represent tho great importance to tho country at
large of such legislation as will encourage the estab-
lishment in this country of mills for spinning cot-
ton, that a largo proportion ofthe cotton now ex-
ported to other countries} may go abroad in tlie form
of yarn double in its exchangeable value, .besides
the advantages that would ateiue to the country
from an inereaso of 100 per cent, in the value of this
great export, your memorialists respectfully repre-
sent that the establishment of spinning-mills in this
and othorsouthem States would result in great ben-
elit, even if it is not essential to the welfare and sub-
sistence of many hundred thousands of dependent
persons, mostly widows and orphans, who might find
in such mills the means of earning for themselves a
support.
Xno Fouthern States, and Alabama in particular,
have largo tracts of country well adapted to the
growth of cereals, abounding in water-power, and
measureably free from tbcimilarial diseases prevail-
ing among tho rich lands upon which the cotton
plant is most successfully grown. In this manufac-
turing region every advantage is present that na-
ture can supply, and it lies in closo proximity to the
cotton-growing belt. Hence it would seem to be truo
wisdom on the part of legislators to foster and stim-
ulate the crcction in these States of many mills lor
spinning cotton. ^
Your memorialists are informed by those who have
thoroughly studied tho subject that to compete suc-
cessfully in the markets of the world with those who
have now almost a monopoly in supplying cotton
yarns it wilt be' necessary, lor a time at least, to
closely imitate their manufacture in stylcand quality,
and that this can bo most successfully 'done only by
using the same kinds of machinery that are tised
abroad.
Tho present tariff upon imports imposes a duty of
40 per cent, in gold upon the cost of such machinery,
which practically prohibits its importation. There
are few persons m the United States who manufac-
ture any kind of machinery for spinning cotton yarn,
and these arc benefited by this high rate of duty at
the expense to tho country of deterring capitalists
in engaging in competition with foreign spinners,
Alanv hundreds of thousands of our own population
are thus deprived of opportunities for self-support,
and tiio country loses a, largo proportion of the ad-
vantage in the exchange of the world that might be
secured by adding tho increase of value given
to cotton by spinning before its exportation. The
imposition of so high a rate of duty is the more
remarkable in view of the fact that machinery for
spinning llax is admitted free.
Your memoiialists would therefore respectfully
 rge a revision of tho tariff with a view to the re-
moval of this restriction, which they bolieve will bo
found upon investigation tobecontrary to every die.
tate of sound principle.
Approved, January, 1870.
Mr. BUCKLEY. Mr. Chairman, the me-
morialists might have added that steam plows
and machinery for the manufacture of sugar
from beets are aiso admitted free of duty. But,
sir, not wishing to strike down one class of
industry to build up another, I introduced on
March 9 a resolution, which was also referred
to the Committee of Ways and Means, and
which asks not for the repeal but for the sus;
pension of the existing tariff of about 40 per
cent, in gold for one year only. That resolu-
tion reads: .
"Resolved, Tliat tho Committeo of Ways and
Means bo instructed to inquire into the expediency
of so amending the tariff laws of the United States
as to allow the free importation of machinery for
spinning cotton into yarn for a period not exceeding
twelve months."
The advocates of protection to American in-
dustry have so repeatedly and so strongly, urged
the establishment of factories at the South, and
have so often referred us to New England and
Pennsylvania to witness the benefits that would
arise from such a course, that the people of
the South are inclined to try the experiment.
Among those who have most strongly urged
the adoption of the policy of diversified indus-
try in the South is trie gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. Kkijjsy ;J and I may say I know
few whose advice in these matters would have
greater weight.
To show how well that gentleman under-
stands our situation, I may bo allowed to make
an extract or two from his speeches in this
House. As long ago as January, 1807, while
advocating the repeal of the 5 per cent, in-
ternal revenue tax upon manufactures, he
saiil:
" Destructive to our interests as tho attempt to pro-
vide for the payment of our debt by extraordinary
taxes on this generation would be, the southern peo-
ple areicss able than wo to endure the mad experi-
ment. Among them are. as J havo said, the widows,
orphans, and maimed soldiers of their armies, whoso
poverty is not relieved oven by the pittance wc givo
as pension.' to tlie samo classes; thotr industrialsys-
tcm has been overthrown and is not yet reorgan-
ised: their cities and towns by their dilapidation
tell now their trade and commerce have suffered,
aiul their lands to a great extent lie waste; their
hanks, insurance companies, and othor moneyed
institutions have Koue inly liquidation; their rail-
roads are in ruins and almost bare of rolling stock:
and they arc milking daily appeals to tho people of
the North for capital with which to open and work
mines of goid, silver, copper, lead, iron, and coal,in
which their land abounds. Scourged by the results
of their own folly, they are awakening to a knowl-
edge of the value of their possessions, and are pro-
posing to make them available. They desire if
tlioy can obtain the requisite capital to locate tho
factory near tho cotton-field and the forgo and fur-
nace near the mino and ore-bed."
And so recently as the 11th of January in
this year, in his eloquent speech upon Mr.
Wells's report, he gave us this advice, which
1 will ask the Clerk to read:
Tho Clerk read as follows :
"Tho cotton-growing portion ofthe United States
is tho proper locality tor cotton factories. Tho South
can spin yarn and produce unbleached fabrics at
from 15 to 20 per cent, less than the same work can
bo done in Hew England, and cheaper ovon than it
can be done by the underpaid laborersof Great Brit-
ain. Will gcntlomcn from the South consider that
what tho picking-room is to the English or northern
iactory tho em-room is to the factory near tho eot-
ton-field, a,nd that all charges incurred between the
two would bo saved by the southern manufacturer?
Before cotton reaches either New or Old England it
must bo pressed and baled and hooped and marked
and transported, losing interest and paying Jreight
and commission at each stage of the transportation ;
and when it has arrived at tho threshold of the dis-
tant factory it must bo freed from its hoops, stripped
of its bagging, and put through tho processes of the
picking-room to restore it with as little damage as
possible to the condition in which it was when itleft
the gin. Prom all these charges the manufacturer
in the cotton district is' free; and together they
amount to what would be a profit which, in connec-
tion with the improvement in quality from the use
of tho unbroken fiber he would use, would enable
him to spin yarns for all the northern States and
England too.
"But this would hurt the English cotton-spinner;
this would advance tho interests of the United States
to the detriment ofEngland, as would the establish-
ment in the midst of the coal and iron fields of Vir-
ginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia of
lurnaees, foundcries, rolling-mills, and steel-works.
Fortunately, tho people' of the South are deeply
impressed with tho importance of tbe early introduc-
tion of these branches of manufactures; and among
the 65 furnaces erected during the last year i are in
Virginia, 6 m Missouri, 3 inKentuckv, 1 in Georgia,
2 m Alabama, and 1 in Tennessee. It is not, there-
lore, probable that very general heed will be given
by the people of the South to the advice offered by
Mr. Wells, or that thoy will abandon the hope of
exporting their cotton in yarn and fabrics, the man-
ufacture ot which will givo employment to and im-
prove tho condition of their now unemployed men
women, and children, or will forego tho privilege ot!
an adequate supply of good and cheap iron manu-
factured in their midst, in order to turn their atten-
tion to making' wooden-ware, soap, stanch, elothing,
and similar articles.' They will not, I apprehend,
be willing to forego th,eir greatest sourer; of profit in
order to oblige him by permitting England still to
retain her supremacy as the cotton-spinner and
principal iron manufacturer of the'world."
Mr. BUCKLEY. Can you wonder, Mr.
Chairman, that though we have very little accu-
mulated capital in the South, and cannot engage
in such enterprises except on a small scale,
we have caught the inspiration of the eloquent .
gentleman and are anxious to make what pro-
gress we may in tlie path he points out? ,JVe
are especially invited to adopt this policy by
the superior natural advantages possessed by
the South for the manufacture of her great
staple, cotton. A North Carolina paper truly
says:
" Her water-power is unsurpassed. Asa general
thing steam is useless in tho South for manufaetur-
i ng purposes; for the face of the country is intersected
by water-courscs such as abound in few other lands,
if we look at the map wo shall see that there is a
perfect not-work of streams, showing that it is one
of the best watered portions of the earth, and the
structure of the country is such that every otic of
those streams can be made to drive machinery. All
t.his magnificent provision of nature has thus far
been permitted to go to waste,in a great measure at
least.
" It is scarcely neoessary to refer to these facilities
more in detail. Every reader knows the vast capa-
city of our larger rivers for these purposes."
Let me call your attention to but one of the
many rivers of Alabama available for such
purposes. 1 quote from the official report to
tho Governor of that State, made by Hon.
Thomas Pearsall, commissioner to survey the
Coosa river and the lands adjacent thereto.
Mr. Pearsall says:
" At the lowest stage of water in the Coosa, during
the months of August, September, and October last,
not more than one third of its volume would bo
required to drive 1,000,000 of spindles at full speed,
with a reserved power ample to convert all the yarns
thus produced into eloth. Each spindle may be esti-
mated to require i- of a pound of raw cotton per day
for all hoavy goods, and 3 ounces per day for medium
yarns, say 3 ounces per day per spindle.
" At this rate of consumption per day 187,500 pounds
would be tho daily consumption; and allowing the
year to consist of 300 days the annual consumption
would amount to 50,250,000 pounds, equal to 112,500
bales of 500 pounds eaoli. Allowing each bale to be
worth $100, §11.200,000 would be required annually to
supply the 1,000,000 spindles. Y/e havo the water-
power, equal to converting every pound of cotton
into yarn, that is or ever will be produced within
eotton States; and last, but not least, the mildness
of our climate gives us an advantage over the frozen
North for four months in the year."
Our peculiarly moist climate in the cotton
belt is another great advantage for the manu-
facture of yarn. One of our manufacturers,
exb orting his brethren of New England to come
and settle among us, says:
• "The same skill and labor at the South that is used
m tlie .tiast can bo my.de to produce amuch finer yarn,
for the reason that the climate is mild and soft and
the cotton is m its virgin purity like snow-flakes as
it tails irom the gin.
" To sum it all np, eastern skill operated at tho
South can make 25 per cent, more profit than in the
liast, and can produce a finer yarn than has over
been made on this continent, orasfine as can bemade
on tho globe. The Yankees have taken the premium
m the world's exhibition of mechanic arts, and they
can do so in the manufacture of the finest yarns and
fabrics it thfcy will but apply their skill at theSouth,
where the climate harmonizes with their objects and
where the pure snow-flake fiber as it falls from the
gin aids m their purpose."
Sir, the altered conditions of the South drive
us into the proposed course. Her destiny has
been changed by the extinction of slavery. A
new South demands new and diversified in-
dustries. _ No longer can surplus capital be
invested in slaves as of old, to raise cotton to
be sold for "British gold" and reinvested in
more slaves and more lands with which to
raise more cotton. Such was the process year
after year, until our worn-out plantations de-
clare to every beholder how ruinous was our
former system of husbandry and how impera-
tive is the demand for a change. Slave prop-
erty has been annihilated; the system of
agriculture based upon sla-ee labor has been
swept away. Hereafter capital,> as it slowly
and gradually accumulates, .will seek invest-
ment in the improvement of the lauds, in the
