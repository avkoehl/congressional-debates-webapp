THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 14,
tlemanknewit would be the introduction into the
Senate of the United States of a man who was a
leader in all the mischief, disorder, burnings, and
murders in Kansas for the last two years, and
who was driven from the Senate of the United
States by a distinguished and eminent Senator,
[Mr. Douglas,] who denounced him as guilty of
the crimes of forgery and perjury.
Mr. STANTON. I presume the gentleman
means Sheriff Jones. [Laughter.]
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I was speaking of
one who would be a Senator of theUnitedStat.es.
He knew I was speaking of James H. Lane.
Mr. BURROUGHS. I call the gentleman to
order.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. I will stop here to
please the gentleman from New York.
The question recurs, who shall be the appoint-
ing power? I beg leave to read to the gentleman
frotn Ohio, who is generally a very dispassionate
man, and who is in the habit of dealing in facts,
an extract from the opinion of the Supreme Court
in a celebrated case arising out of the Dorr rebel-
lion. But before reading it, I will remark that
the gentleman from Ohio, in speaking of parties,
said he would not give the appointing power to
onÂ£ party or the other, because either party would
act upon the principle that to the victoTs belong
the spoils. Bat the country is divided into polit-
ical parties, and the appointing power must be
lodged somewhere.
But upon this question I will not enlarge. I
read from the seventh volume of Howaid's Re-
ports some remarks of Judge Nelson, in the Dorr
case, made when the Federal court was in the full
enjoyment of the highest confidence of the entire
country. He said: '
" It is said that tins powor'in the 1'resuliint i* (Ulcerous

That was the great power recognizing the sov-
ereign authority of a State. It was not a little,
petty matter like this, but the power of deciding
which of the parties of a State was the tiue pop-
ular sovereignty of the State, lie says:

Such, sir, was the language of tho Supreme
Court, in reference to n great matter; and shall
that argument not be regarded as having; ell'oct
and value, in reference to a little matter of tins
description ? It does seem to im- most remarkable
that here, in a District within our exclusive juris-
diction; here in a District where the population is
fleeting and unsettled, and where, consequently,
the people cannot couiiibute to the full extent le-
quisite for an efficient police, we, the Represent-
atives of die people, interested for our own per-
sonal safety, and for the safety of those whom
our presence brings here on business, are unwill-
ing to create a proper and sufficient police for the
purpose of keeping down the rowdies and others
who come from adjoining cities for the advantage
of the harvest which they expect to reap here
from the concentration of Federal authority on
this point. 1 ask, gentlemen, if it be possible that
we can pause or hesitate to do what may secuie
that safety to which we are entitled, because a
partisan has to make the appointments? In whom
can the power rest with so much safety as in the
hands of one who has been elevated to the highest
position in the world by the voices of his country-
men, and who has^now nothing to-seek but their
affection and regard ?
Mr. jVIAYNaRD obtained the floor,but yield-
ed it to
Mr. WRIG-HT, of Georgia, who moved that
the committee use.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose;andthe Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. .Tones, of Tennessee, re-
ported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the state of the Union generally under consider-
ation, and particularly the special order, being
Senate bill " to establish an auxiliary guard for
the protection of public and private property in
the city of Washington, and repealing all acts
heretofore passed in relation to that subject;" and
had come to- no resolution thereon.

1>S,J March, A. D. ISott.
FERRIS FORMAN,
Secretary of State.
Mr. RRODEIMCK. The resolutions intro-
duced by my colleague, from the Legislature of
California, will have no influence upon my action
here, now or in the future. I am satisfied that
these resolutions do not exptess the opinions of
the people of California upon the question to
which they lefer. I am satisfied, sir, that four
fifths of the people of California repudiate the
i Lecompton fuvad. 1 shall respect the wishes of
: the people, and pay no respect to the resolutions
j passed by a Legislature not representing the opin-
! ions of the people of California. I merely say this
; now for the purpose of placing myself right on the
record.
Mr. GWIN. I do not intend to discuss this
: question, as it has passed from the consideiafion
of the Senate. I take issue with the Senator in
his statement as to the public sentiment m Cali-
fornia on this subject, arid accept the tribunal he
invokesâthe people. Before that great tribunal
I am willing to be present myself, and abide its
decision, having no doubt or fear of the result.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the printing of the resolutions.
Mr. BRODERICK. I have no objection to the
printing.
The resolutions were ordered to be printed.
