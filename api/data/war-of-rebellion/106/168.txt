Major G. M. HANSON,

Superintendent of Indian Affairs,

Northern District of California, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communications of the 9th and 10th instant, with copies of three letters addressed to you from the Round Valley Reservation. To prevent any further molestation of the Indians remaining on the reservation, I have directed Colonel F. J. Lippitt to declare martial law over the whole valley, and to station a sufficient number of troops there to insure peace and quiet as well as protection of the public property. After a careful consideration of the subject, I fully concur with you as to the best disposition of the Indians, viz, let there be but two reservations, one embracing the Round Valley for all interior Indians, and one at Smith's River Valley for the coast Indians. Should you deem it advisable you are at liberty to submit this communication to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

With great respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
