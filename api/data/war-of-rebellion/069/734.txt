GENERAL: All quiet through the night. Trees were cut down on the left of Redoubt Fletcher to widen the artillery range toward the battery in front of the Eighteenth Corps. The enemy's sharpshooters annoy us some. A soldier of the Twenty-seventh Michigan was killed just in rear of the main line of that regiment while my messenger was present this morning.

Very respectfully,
