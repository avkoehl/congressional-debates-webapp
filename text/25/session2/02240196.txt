Mr HAINES had obiected ^eveial days ago to the reconi

doubts upon his mind whether any time would be gained or

Mr HOWARD said if he thought it possible that the com

frame the hill acceptable to it, he wouid cheerfully accede to
us recommitment, but those opinions could not be ascertained
unless the House voted on some of the amendments More
over, the committee had reponed precisely what gentlemen
said they would, viz a distinct measure, and, unlet-s the House
would take a vote on some oí the propositions, the Committee
on Foreign Allans could not possibly asceit an tlie wishes ofthe
