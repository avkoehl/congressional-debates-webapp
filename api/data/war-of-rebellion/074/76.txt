Mr. GRAHAM:

Please send me a "Memphis Appeal" every morning by some one coming to Station 118.

BELLINGER,

Lieutenant.

General HOOD:

The enemy have fortified the position they took from our skirmishers yesterday; no other change.

General JOHNSTON:

Enemy skirmishers are in the clearest field on our left, where Generals Cheatham's and Hardee's skirmishers were a day or two ago, and fighting. The field is south of Golgotha Church and east of Lost Mountain.

P. B. LEE.

General H.:

The enemy have driven in our skirmishers, and are moving rapidly in heavy column to General Hood's right, evidently for the purpose of flanking him.

P. B. LEE.

General H.:

Enemy passing left flank in column on road.

Later.-Enemy re-enforced his skirmish line on right of Acworth dirt road pretty heavily. All the batteries east of railroad are opening upon us.

G. A. HENRY.

General HOOD:

Enemy's skirmishers push east of railroad and driving them back.

Laster.-Enemy constantly re-enforcing their skirmish lines taken from us on the Acworth road. Some parties moving out with spades. My opinion is they will fortify their lines to-night.

Later.-General, I did not know any of General Polk's corps was east of railroad. Enemy's infantry is now four or five miles east of here.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

I disagree with Major Lee as to the distance the enemy's infantry extended east of the railroad. My opinion is that two miles and a half will cover their infantry, and their cavalry extends one mile in advance of their infantry.

G. A. HENRY.

Enemy's position unchanged since my last dispatch. Shall I remain after night?
