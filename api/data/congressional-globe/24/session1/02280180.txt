REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS.
On motion by Mi. ALLAN, of Kentucky, the
following resolution, submitted by him on the
7th ultimo, was again taken up
Resolved, That a seleet committee be appointed, whose
duty it shall be to inquire into the expediency of extending
the provisions ot the act of Congress, for the benefit of the
surviving oflicers and soidieis of the revolutionary army,
p used Uie 7th of June, 1832, so as to embrace those who
weie cngagtd m the ware of the Tjnited fatates which oc
I currod between the treaty of peaee with Groat Biitam, m
17b3, and the treaty of Greenville, with the Indians, in
179o, and that the said committee have leave to report by
bill or otbeiwise
The motion pending was the amendment of
Mi Mann, of New York, to strikeout " a select
committee," and mseit " the Committee on Rev-
olutionary Pensions "
Mr MANN, of New York, said, while he as
highly appreciated the meritorious sei vices of
those contemplated undei tins resolution as any
other gentleman, yet, considering the operations
of the pension system, its vast extent, and the
vast amount of the public funds it involved, he
was utterly and entnely opposed to any further
extension of it at this time There were evils
enough lesultmg fiom the system in the section
of country he had the honoi to represent, and he
i himself had seen so much of it, that he was per-
fectly satisfied, if the whole case could be prop-
erly presented and fully undeistood, there would
be very little difficulty m confining its operations
to that class of individuals alone who had sacri-
ficed then all in the revolutionary struggle
The CHAIR intimated to the gentleman, that
on the question of refeience the ments of the
íesoluüon were not open to debate
Mi MANN said he withdrew his motion He
did not design to debate the merits of the resolu-
tion, but to make a few remaiks in explanation or
justification of the motion he had made at a for-
mer day, and which, undei the peculiai state of
the case, he now saw fit to withdiaw
Mr VANDERPOEL believed, if he lecol-
lecttd light, this whole subject was befoie the
House some two oi three weeks last year, and its
whole merits woie veiy fully discussed. If Mr.
V were now called upon to vote, ho had no hesita-
tion in saying that he should vote against it,
without moie light than he had upon the subject.
Ihe only question now before them was, whether
they should appoint a select committee, for which
he was peifectly willing to vote, so that the merits
and claims of those individuals might be laid be-
foie the House But, in so voting, he was not to
be ronsidi led as committing himself upon the
ments of the case ultimately, when the subject
came fully before the House, though he would
gn e to tht subject the best consideration in Ins
powei
Mr   WILLIAMS,  of Kentucky, moved to
amend the íesoluüon by instructing the commit-
tee to niquue into the expediency of extending
tht piovisions  of the  act of the 7th of June,
1832, so as to include those in the seivice of the
United  States  in  the  revolutionary  wai for  a
shoiter period than six months
,     Mi   WARDWELL informed the gentleman
IJ fiom Kentucky that, if lie would refer to the pro-
, ceedmys of the Ho ise, he would find that a bill
' was already lcpoitid, embracing the very pro-
I vision contemplated by the gentleman's amend-
, ment
Mi    WILLIAMS   thereupon   withdiew his
I   amendment
I      Mr DEBERRY moved that the committee be
fuither instructed to lnqunt into the expediency
I   of so extending the act of thi 7fh of June, 1832,
II  as to embrace the wagoneis, mechanics, &c , dur
I ing the 1 evolutional y war
I     Mr  WARDWFLL suggested that the adop-
| tion oí this amendment would confound two ob-
jects, that of the i evolutionary soldiers, and those
engaged m the Indian wars, which ought to be
kept distinct, besides which there was a consti-
