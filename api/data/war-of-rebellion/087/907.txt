HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October 30, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: No change or movement of troops has been observed during past twenty-four hours; everything has been remarkably quiet along our front. Two deserters from the Second Corps came in last night; one reported that the enemy thought our line very weak, owing to the fact that they found no men in the fort which they took on the evening of the 27th. He also reported that their front line was very weak; did not think any other troops besides the Second Corps were in our front. The enemy are throwing up a work for a battery to bear upon Fort Harris, one of our batteries.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, wounded, 2; Ransom's brigade, wounded, 2; Wise's brigade, wounded, 2; total, 6 wounded.

Three regiments of Wallace's brigade relieved by Mahone and brought in reserve.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant MCWILLIE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October 31, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: Quite a brisk musketry fire sprang up about 10 o'clock last night to the right of this division, and gradually extended to the left. The firing was exclusively from the picket-lines. General Gracie reports that trains stopped in front of his lines last night, and the enemy's camp-fires became brighter than usual, which would seem to indicate that fresh troops had arrived. Two deserters came in last night; they belong to the Second Corps, and said that corps was the only one in our front. They also state that their officers regarded the engagement on our right a few days since as very disastrous to them.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, killed 1. Elliott's brigade, killed, 1, wounded, 1. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 1. Wise's brigade, killed, 1. Total, 3 killed, 2 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
