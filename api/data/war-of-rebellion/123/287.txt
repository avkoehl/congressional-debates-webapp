depot. The transportation, reasonable expenses of this duty, and five dollars will be paid for each officer or private so arrested and delivered.

By order of the President:

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., July 31, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I think it is unfortunate to undertake to recruit for the old regiments while the new ones are being raised. The two systems come in conflict and mutually defeat each other. It would be better to wait at least three weeks in this State before recruiting for the old regiments begins.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., July 31, 1862-2.35 p. m.

His Excellency O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana, Indianapolis:

Any violent change in the present recruiting system would be fatal. One recruit for an old regiment is worth two for a new one. Do not, therefore, discourage enlistments for old regiments, even if it delays the new ones somewhat.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CLINTON, IOWA, July 31, 1862-2.50 p. m. (Received 8.30 p. m.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I have no answer to my telegrams of yesterday in relation to transportation of the Eighteenth Iowa Infantry, in relation to payment of bounties and advance pay, or in relation to tents. Answers are important to me, and the service, and to the recruiting for new regiments.

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 31, 1862-4.50 p. m.

Adjt. General N. B. BAKER,

Clinton, Iowa:

The Eighteenth Iowa will be sent to Saint Louis to be armed and equipped, and will then be ordered here or elsewhere, as circumstances may require. Recent rebel movements render it uncertain where additional forces will first be needed.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
