HEADQUARTERS,Nashville, February 14, 1862.

To the COMMANDANT OF THE POST AT CLARKSVILLE, TENN.:

You will at once take proper steps to have the railroad bridges over Elk Fork and Whippoorwill, between State Line and Russellville, burned up. Let no delay occur.

A. S. JOHNSTON,

General, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Edgefield, February 14, 1862.

Major-General HARDEE, Commanding:

I inclose copies of dispatches from General Floyd. You will perceive the necessity of hastening your march as possible. It must be continued day and night until the army crossed the Cumberland. Let it be known that the object is to secure the crossing of the Cumberland and no apprehension of the enemy in rear. You will thus preserve their morale. This order must be communicated to the rear of the column, and cavalry be left in rear to assist the sick and bring up stragglers.

W. W. MACKALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,Edgefield, February 14, 1862.

Major-General HARDEE, Bolwing Green, Ky.:

The general regards it important that the column should be concentrated here as rapidly as is consistent with an orderly march, and hopes that your arrangements will be such that the troops longest held at Bowling Green to forward supplies may reach this place as early as their baggage wagons. He wishes you to guard against accident by putting two days' provisions for them in the train.

W. W MACKALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WOODBURN, KY., February 14, 1862-10 p. m.

General A. SIDNEY JOHNSTON:

I left Bowling Green to-day at 3.30. At 12 m. the enemy appeared with artillery, three pieces, I think, on Baker's Hill, and opened fire on the town, and especially the depot. We were compelled to abandon the depot, which was subsequently burned. We retired at once and in perfect order. I shall move on as rapidly as possible. I particularly desire that you send a train to Franklin to receive my sick and extra has crossed the Barren, supposed on pontoon bridge; force not known.

Have cavalry, artillery, and infantry.

W. J. HARDEE,

Major-General.
