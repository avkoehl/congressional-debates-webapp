the protection of that article. As she succeeded
in securing the markets of the world for this
branch of manufacture, by the course which she
marked out jyid adhered to, we may, to some ex-
tent, profit by her example.
The first duty England placed upon imports of
iron was in 1679, a duty of 10s. per ton; in 1710,
raised to £2 10s. 6d.; in 1782, raised to 16s. 2rf.
In 1784, (the memorial from which these figures
are taken proceeds to state,) the rolling mill was
invented; and from this period may be dated the
commencement of the present English iron man-
ufacture. The 24 years preceding this time cm-
brace all the inventions now in common use,and
which created a new system of making iron, and
to which England owes the extent and cheapness
ofher manufacture at the present day. And from
tins time also is to be dated the commencement of
her present system of protection. She was not
satisfied with a protective duty on foreign iron;
for, in 1785, she prohibited the export of any tools,
engines, models, or plans of machinery used in
the manufacture of iron, under a penalty of one
year's imprisonment and =£200 fine, and the con-
fiscation of the articles shipped, or intended to be
shipped. She inflicted heavy fines npon masters
of vessels, custom-house officers, and others, who
violated these laws, as well as upon all who en-
ticed workmen out of the kingdom. I do not pro-
fess to follow her example in these particulars;
but refer to them for the purpose of showing her
determination to build up this branch of her ma-
terial greatness, as well as to show the import-
ance which English statesmen attached to it.
In 1787, she prohibited the importation of all the
manufactures of iron and steel.
In 1788, England had 77 furnaces in blast; and
the production was 61,900 tons iron.
In 1795, the act of 17(35, prohibiting the exports
of tools mid machinery used m the manufacture
of iran, was made perpetual.
In 1796, duty on iron was raised <£3 Is. 9d. per
ton. At this time there were 121 furnaces in blast;
find the yearly product was 13*4,879 tons, amount-
ing to an increase yield of 28 per cent, in 8 years.

tofore prohibited, now admitted at a duty of

In 1820 product was 400,000 tons.
In 1823 "  452,000 "
In 1824 "  581,367 "
In 1826 the duty was reduced on bars unwrought
to £1 10s.
Here, then, we have shown the plan adopted
by England in laying duties in favor of a home
production, for a period ofone hundred and forty-
seven years,jn fifteen different changes; and the
result is, as is truly stated in the memorial from
which these statistics are derived, "unwavering
protection always under specific duties, and always in-
creasing in amount until they xoereno longemeeiled."
The imports of foreign iron for consumption and
manufacture in England, for the ten years pre-
vious to 1826, averaged 9,729 tons, or 10 j per
ccnt. of the export; and for the succeeding ton
years of low duties, were 14,586 tons; being 10£
per cent, of the exports for the same period; show-
ing that the duty became a dead letter before it
was taken off, as the imports of foreign iron, after
the duties were taken off, did not maintain their
proportion to the exports of British iron.
And the production of English iron, when by
proper protection she had fostered this branch of
industry, went on increasing to an amazing ex-
tent, until, by the production of the article, the
command of capital, and the cheapness of labor,
she has sccurcd the iron market of the world.
In 1836, her productions reached l,000,000tons.
In 1840, it was 1,396,400 tons. In 1845,1,512,500
tons. In 1846, the duty'was taken off entirely.
In 1848, the make was 1,998,568 tons; and in
1849 it was 2,000,000 tons. In 1855, the pro-
duction of English iron may be set down at the
enormous figure of3,585,906 tons pig.
Why was this success attained? Let us read
aright the lesson of experience here taught. What
element of success lias England, in this regard,
which gives her an advantage over us? Her fields
of iron ore and of coal compare not with ours.
Are hor sons more laborious or more enterprising
than our people > The answer is easy of solution.
Her statesmen were more consistent and enlight-
ened in their efforts to foster home industry.
England has the advantage of contiguous coal
and iron fields, chcap labor, the perfection and
cast of machinery, and abundant capital. Her
commercial policy has made her the great ccnter
of the financial world. Her mineral resources
have been developed by centuries of skill and
labor; and all the details of her business interests
have been nicely adjusted, calculated, and per-
fected. Foreign competition has been burdened
or excluded, until, in the perfection and cheap-
ness of her manufacture of iron, she defies the
world. Her vast capital enables her manufac-
turers to withhold their articles of export from
market until there is a demand at a paying price;
or to push them upon a foreign market, and,
breaking down all opposition, secure purchasers
upon their own terms. And, as if to assist in the
work of domestic destruction, we have kindly
built Government warehouses for them, in winch
to store their goods under bond, and withhold
them from a falling market, or to push them upon
a rising one at pleasure; while the American man-
ufacturer, short of capital, and always obliged to
realize, must throw his goods upon any market
which cither bad legislation or the superiority of
capital may have prepared for his rum.
Shall we yield to foreign advantages, and, ac-
knowledging their supremacy, become " hewers
of wood and drawers of water" to them, or by a
wise, just, and American policy, protect our peo-
ple until we can, in turn,defy foreign competition?
Surely an American Congress mil not long hesitate
which course to adopt.
Contrast this English system with the mode of
treatment pursued byourGevernmcnt in relation
to the same article. Observe the insufficiency of
the duties in all instances, with one exception, in
modern times; the vacillation of statesmen; the
sudden changes in legislation on this subject; the
fact that, under the ad valorem system, with foreign
values as recognized m the bill of 1846, duties
were high when not required to be high, and low
when they should havo been high, and you will
discover the secret of monetary revolutions and
industrial disasters.
Tho production of American iron was, in the
year 1810,54,000 tons. The " war duties," as
they arc generally termed, of the tariff of 1812,
terminated with the fiscal year ending June 30,
1817, and tho revenue tariff of 1816, in which tho
principle of protection was not recognized, then
commenced to operate. Under its disastrous
operation, we find that a commercial crisis oc-
curred in 1821, the business of the country was
destroyed, and the production of iron in that year
did not reach 20,000 tons.
The tariff of 1816 was succecdcd by that of
1824, and subsequently by that of 1828, in both
of which the principle of protection was recog-
nized. Mark the result. In 1828 tho production
of iron reached 130,000 tons.
In 1829 142,000 "
In 1830 165,000 "
In 1831 191,000 "
In 1832 200,000 "
In 1840   315,000 "
At this point, the trade began to feel the disas-
trous influence of the compromise tariff enacted
in 1833, as in its operation it reached the free-
trade line. Before 1842 we had the usual com-
mercial crisis—suspension of specie payments
and the bankrupt law—and we fmd in 1842 that a
large portion of the furnaces had " blown out,"
and the production of iron had fallen to little more
than 20(5,000 tons.
Then came the good tariff law of 1842, with
ample protection and specific duties; and with it
came confidence and capital and industry. The
country seemed instinct with life, and the song of
the laboring man was heard in tlis land. Consult
the record of the years following the enactment
of that law, and before the baneful influences of
the black tariff of 1846 had made themselves
felt, and you will find the record to be one of
success in all branches of industry, and marked
with commercial, mechanical, and industrial life.
And, like all other departments of manufacture,
the iron business felt the inspiration which flowed
from healthy legislation. In 1846 the Secretary
of tho Treasury estimated the production of iron
in the United States to be 765,000 tons, having
trebled in four years. In 1847 it reached 800,000
tons. Then commenced tho in jurious effect of tho
tariff of 1846; for we find in 1848 the production
was stationary, and in 1849 it fell to 650,000 tons,
and continued to fall, until m January, 1853, the
make did not exceed 500,000 tons. Under ail the
circumstances I have referred to, this production
of one half million tons seems remarkable, when
you take into consideration the fact that in 1806,
only fifty-four years since, tho total product of the
viorld did not cxcecd that amount, and now does
not exceed qjie half the annual product of the
United States.
Wc havo an abundance of iron ore and min-
eral coal for the cheap production of iron. Out
of 184,073 square miles of coal area, our country
has 133,132, or nearly three-fourths of the whole
number. We have sixteen, times as much as
Great Britain and Ireland together,. This coal
exists in neaily every State in the Union; or
where it docs not exist, is quite within reach
of the iron ore deposits m the now coal-bearing
States. Tho anthracite coal trade of Pennsyl-
vania is immense. In 1820 it reached but 365
tons, while in 1859 it had increased to the enor-
mous figure of 7,780,418 tons. Of this amount,
my own county*of Schuylkill, with 113 collieries,
produced 3,048,615 tons, the remainder having
been sent to market from the Lehigh, Wyoming,
and Susquehanna regions. Add to this production
of anthracite the semi-bituminou3 coal of Penn-
sylvania, and it will give you an aggregate of
more than 12,000,000 tons of coal; and this, under
low prtccs, depression, and universal stagnation
in the coal trade. It is as nothing compared with
that which we could produce, with a fair demand,
at remunerative priccs. Arguing from the abund-
ance of coal and iron ore, as well as from the wise
distribution ©ver the face of the country which
Providence has made of these gifts to Hia children,
the United States can produce 50,000,000 tons of
iron with as little drain upon her natural re-
sources as Great Britain can 3,250,000 tons.
Why, then, should not these great natural ad-
vantages he fostered and cared for? It is not a
question for Pennsylvania alone, as some gentle-
men seem to consider. It is not a question alone
for Virginia; nor yet for Ohio. It is a question
for every State and Territory in the Union; for
the great gifts to which I have referred are scat-
tered over the whole land with endless profusion,
sisfiicient unto the wants of all the generations of
men. Tell me, iron men of Kentucky, Georgia,
Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, Missouri, Nov/
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, will
you construct your railroads of foreign bars, when
tho very soil upon which you lay the inferior,
cinder-constructed rail, the fit representative of de-
crepid legislation, is bursting with rich and supe-
rior ores, ready to be constructed into a sound
article by the thousands of unemployed and skill-
ful workmen in your midst ? Does not the history
of this branch of labor prove it?
_ I assert, and will show,thatthe adequate protec-
tion of ail article cheapens it to the producer. Eut
ifyouprocced upon theideathattheconsumcrpays
the duty laid upon any article, which I deny, then,
I reply, that iron is a legitimate subject for tax-
ation ; for, if paid by the consumer before protection
furnishes-him with a cheaper article, the burdtm
is borne equally by all classes of the community.
It is used in all the departments of life. It flashes
in the needle; it rives the soil; sings in the spindle;
rings in the ani'il, and clashes and clangs m
" The battle of lever and wheel."
It builds the palaces of commerce; spans broad
