Your own forces are for the protection of the road. You are the commandant of the post. General Averell's command should cover the town. You keep it quiet. I look to you.

CAMDEN STATION, BALTIMORE, MD.,

January 1, 1864. (Received 10. 50 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Our agent at Martinsburg telegraphs us at 7. 50 this morning that General Averell advised us to move all our power and cars to Harper's Ferry, or east of that. The pickets were driven, at 4 o'clock this a. m., from a point 4 miles north of Winchester. One brigade of the enemy reported as moving toward Martinsburg. The general also reports that the Government pickets were driven in at Bunker Hill and firing heard on the Tuscarora road. These advised appear to be ominous of a heavy movement. Will you require additional transportation, and from what point?

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
