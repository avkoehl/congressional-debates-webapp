NOVEMBER 3, 1861.

Your dispatch received. A boat has been ordered up, but to make sure a large paulin will be sent down to you, with which, spread under a lot of wagon-beds, you will ne able to make a large scow. The wagon-beds will have to be lashed crosswise, laid on two poles, and having two poles over them; rope lashing to go between. Telegraph down to Charleston for plenty of bed-corn, in case we should not have plant here. Woods, Siber, and Tyler must clear the other side of the river and prevent firing on teams immediately.

Your dispatch received. Three boats will be sent you this evening. You will find the wagon-body arrangement makes a solid and capacious float of great capacity, and may be rowed across with double oars or sweeps. Have the poles 25 feet long and 4 or 5 inches in diameter. Take 6 wagon-bodies. A single wagon-body and tent-fly doubled under it makes a good boat. Conceal your movements, and clear everything up to Loop Creek.

The commanding general excepts you to go up Loop Creek in force or else this side, closing the mouth of it. Will likely give final orders to-morrow morning. Push information as far as possible. Will telegraph Major Leiper to see if he can send you scout.

Take what bread you need. Will not the hawser of the boat or picket rope answer? You can keep the Victor and the scow. Retain Silver Lake until the Victor comes. It was so intended. Boats are excepted up that may bring the rope required. You can move over the river to-morrow with your tents, leaving a company or two on this side for a camp guard. Tyler's and Gilbert's men will come up unless something occurs to prevent them, which i do not anticipate. Final orders will be given when both ends are ready.
