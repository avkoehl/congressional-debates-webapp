to my left and rear, continuing to threaten my right and front, I must either imperil my whole command by too great an extension of my line or else submit to a complete investment with Port Gibson in their possession. The gunboats, five in number, are still just above, firing occasionally at our batteries. The enemy is reported as pressing [I. F.] Harrison gradually back. No movement has yet been made by them to occupy the Ballard plantation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. BOWEN.

JACKSON, April 27, 1863.

Major M. R. CLARK, Brookhaven:

Send a messenger to Captain [William] Wren. Tell him to ascertain the position of the enemy and move in direction of him. Try to ambuscade him and annoy him, particularly at night in his camp.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 27, 1863.

Commander of Cavalry from Port Hudson, Tangipahoa, La.:

Move up north with your command, and be guided by such information as you receive en route.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, MISS., April 27, 1863.

Colonel T. P. DOCKERY, Big Black Bridge, Edwards Depot:

General Stevenson will send cavalry to co-operate with you. Vigilance should be increased. A guard of a company should be increased. A guard of a company should be kept at each end of this bridge and trestle-work.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 27, 1863.

General GARDNER, Port Hudson:

From information derived from a prisoner, it is believed that it is the design of this party of the enemy to join Banks. You must make every effort to intercept them. They were to-day, 12 o'clock, at Hazlehurst, on New Orleans and Jackson Railroad.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 27, 1863.

Colonel [JAMES] JACKSON, Twenty-seventh Ala., Edwards Depot:

Move your regiment at once up to Big Black Bridge. One company must be kept at each end of the bridge and trestle-work, and well picketed intermediately.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

MERIDIAN, April 27, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Jackson, MISS.:
