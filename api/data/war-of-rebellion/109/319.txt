GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF Kentucky, Numbers 2. Lexington, Ky., January 5, 1862.

It is with deep regret that the major-general commanding announces to this army the death of Colonel Moses Wisner, of the Twenty-second Michigan Volunteer Infantry, who at 5 a. m. to-day departed this life near the city of Lexington, Ky. The deceased was appointed colonel of the regiment that now so sadly moursn his loss on the 8th day of August, A. D. 1862. Before entering the service he was a resident of Pontiac, State of Michigan. Although he was yet a young man at the time of his deatch, the had already occupied the highest and most responsible political position in his State, having been Governor of the State of Michigan from A. D. 1858 to 1860. When his country called for men to fight her battles, he cheerfully gave up the honors and peaceful pursuits of the citizen to undergo the hardships and privations of the soldier's life. He died in camp, absent from the comforts of home, but surrounded by the soldiers who loved him - dying with the proud consciousness of having faithfully served his country in this her hour of peril. Thus closes an honorable and useful life of a true patriot, a good soldier, and a courteous gentleman. The regimental colors of the Twenty-second Regiment Michigan Volunteer Infantry will be draped in mourning, and the officers of the First Brigade, Second Division, of this army, will wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days.

By order of Major General G. Granger:

WM. C. RUSSELL,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
