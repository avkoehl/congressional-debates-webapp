Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEAR SIR: We jointly desire to take the oath of allegiance in order to be released, as we are not natives of the States now in rebellion against the Government; but as we were South at the commencement of the paresent difficulty and joined them more through necesdsity than patriotism, as all kinds of business was dull and nothing doing, therefore we had to do something of the kind or otherwise suffer for the want of food, as all communication with our friends was cut off and it was impossible to obtain relief or to get out of the States then in rebellion without great peril to our lives and persons.

Of privateer Petrel, and a native of Frederick, Md.
