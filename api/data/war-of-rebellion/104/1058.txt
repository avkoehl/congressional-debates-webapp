General WILSON:

I forward you the following from the Secretary of War. Please have his instructions carried out as soon as possible.*

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, July 1, 1865.

General WILSON:

Don't send cavalry to Florida, unless ordered to do so by General Grant. He informed me when in Washington that he had directed you to send about 2,000 to South Carolina. If you have not been able to spare that many yet, you can relieve the reorganized regiment [sic] return to Georgia. The Cavalry Corps will be dissolved and you placed in command of the cavalry in Georgia and will be in the district where Macon is. Report to General Steedman, commanding department, headquarters at Augusta. Make out a letter of recommendation that General G. W. Smith be pardoned, and I will forward it, recommended. Many thanks for the fruit; it is nice, and the finest I have seen.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
