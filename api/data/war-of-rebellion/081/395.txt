General BURNSIDE:

I have proposed to take the hill in front of my left at 7 p.m. to-day. I think I can succeed without much loss. If I fail it may result in a heavy attack from the enemy. I though it best to inform you so that you might make necessary arrangements on your front.

Respectfully.

General S. WILLIAMS.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Just before the receipt of your dispatch I had requested General Parke to tell you that the Eighth Infantry was ready to go to the Fifth Corps. I intended to have sent it the day before yesterday afternoon, but delayed it in hope of seeing the general commanding personally and asking again to have it remain, but it will now be sent at once if desired. Please answer.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.
