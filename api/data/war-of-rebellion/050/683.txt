September 8-1.30 p.m.

Respectfully forwarded through corps headquarters for the information of the commanding general of the army.

I sent in the substance of Colonel Harker's verbal report last evening, immediately on his return, but time was necessary this morning for the preparation of the written report and map.* The arrangements made for the reconnaissance,and the time of its moving, were well adjusted, and the reconnaissance itself was most brilliantly and successfully conducted by Colonel Harker. I do not believe that military annals offer an instance of a more daring reconnaissance made by so small a force against an intrenched position, strongly garrisoned, attended with so little loss.

Respectfully forwarded, commending Colonel Harker for his conduct and his report.

Major-General, Commanding.

THREE MILES FROM GORDON'S MILLS ON RECONNAISSANCE.

General WOOD:

GENERAL: I have been driving the enemy's cavalry to this point. Jackson's brigade of infantry encamped here last night. We have mortally wounded one cavalryman, who reports himself belonging to an Arkansas regiment of Forrest's command. They have resisted my skirmishers somewhat stubbornly, and have opened upon me with two pieces of artillery. I believe it the rear guard of the enemy. I do not believe he will stand this side of La Fayette. I will push the reconnaissance about 2 miles farther, and if I do continue to meet with more resistance, will return to the gap near Rossville and await orders.

C. G. HARKER.
