crossed over to the Florence road, and upon this cross-road ran into a rebel courier-line, which appears to communicate with the Columbia road. It is said by Union citizens this is the route by which the rebels get their information from Columbia and Nashville. I will capture or break up this communication to-day. I have not been able to obtain any intelligence of General Hatch, nor have I heard from you, and am in doubts as to what is best to be done. It will be impossible for me to remain here longer than a day or two, forage having given out and no rations in the country. The roads are entirely impassable off the pike, and the pike itself sunk several feet in the mud in some places. The heavy scouting, and the mode of foraging necessary, is fast using up the stock; each man is obliged to carry his forage many miles on the horse he is riding, thus breaking him down and ruining his back. There is absolutely nothing within a circuit of fifteen miles for man or beast, the country desolated and laid waste by the forces previously passing through it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE CAPRON,

Colonel, Commanding First Brigade, Cav. Division, Army of the Ohio.

HUNTSVILLE, November 21, 1864-12.10 a.m.

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, November 21, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have forbidden all parties crossing the river, but the gun-boats take parties from the south side and pass them over to the north, and, too, without a sufficient knowledge of the parties. Four persons arrested at Huntsville yesterday who were crossed over the river by the gun-boats.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, November 21, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

We have no news of any movement of the enemy. I have scouts out in every direction, and if they can possibly communicate with me will have timely notice of the approach of the enemy. Colonel Hall reports having killed five of Russell's command, who tore up the track day before yesterday, and captured a few horses and saddles. He fed his horses and men from what Russell had prepared for his own command. I continue to beg for a few good cavalry. I could make it pay for itself twice over. One thousand good cavalry at this post could give us all the information we want; besides the news it could gather, it would open the way for my scouts.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
