CITY POINT, VA., January 12, 1865-11 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

You may direct the batteries of Schofield's corps to be left behind. I think, however, it may be advisable for him to bring two companies of artillerists to each division, to be fitted up here, if necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 12, 1865-12.15 p.m.

(Received 1.p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff;

If Colonel W. A. Nichols can be spared I wish you would have him ordered to the Army of the Potomac as assistant adjutant-general. I have relieved General Williams, and put him on my staff as inspector-general, having particular duties which I have selected him to perform.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 12, 1865-2.30 p.m.

(Received 5.10 p.m.)

Colonel S. L. BROWN,

Quartermaster-General's Office:

Your dispatch received. I am glad to see you have so much en route hither, but if it were all here to-day we would have only twenty-two days' grain and thirteen hay. We have half rations of forage only for to-day.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General and Chief Quartermaster.

CITY POINT, VA., January 12, 1865.

Colonel M. R. MORGAN,

Fort Monroe:

Have any of the vessels loaded with troops from Baltimore made their appearance yet?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

FORT MONROE, January 12, 1865-1 p.m.

General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

About 1,500 men have arrived, with fifteen gallons of water to a man. By direction of General Grant, I ordered them ashore at Newport News while rations are being put on board and water replenished. Have I done rightly?

M. R. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.
