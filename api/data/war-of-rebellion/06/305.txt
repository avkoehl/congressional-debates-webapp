HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF GEORGIA,Savannah, November 1, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to inclose to you a communication received to-day from Colonel T. J. Warthen, commanding a regiment at one of the camps of instruction recently placed under my authority, and by your directions ordered to Richmond. These camps having been established directions ordered to Richmond. These camps having been established by the governor, under some sort of authority from the late Secretary of War, he (the governor) attempts such control over them as may delay their preparations for departure. Of course no attention will be paid by me to this notice of "protest," and I only inclose the letter to explain the precise state of things at the time I assume command of these camps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. R. LAWTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS CAMP STEPHENS,October 30, 1861.

General A. R. LAWTON:

But a few hours since I received a communication from his excellency the governor, stating that he had not been advised by the Secretary of War of the action of the Department in ordering this regiment to Virginia, and, moreover, station that he had just written to the Department protesting, in the name of the State, against this and other regiments being removed from the State. I thought it due to you that you should be notified of the same.

Again signifying to you that I shall obey with pleasure any order emanating from you, I subscribe myself, your obedient servant,

THOMAS J. WARTHEN,

Colonel, Commanding Twentieth Regiment Georgia Volunteers.
