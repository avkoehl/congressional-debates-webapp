At dusk last evening, I opened fire on the enemy's works immediately in our front, with eight guns, preserving five minute intervals between each gun, and thus continued until daylight this morning. I succeeded in preventing the enemy from working on their advance works, and considerably damaged their stockade and works nearest us. They returned our fire during the night with six or more mortars, and with shell and shrapnel from two or more Parrott guns. Their firing was very good, though we had only 1 killed and 4 wounded during the night, which are as follows:

Private J. H. Cassiday, Company G, First Volunteers, Georgia Regiment, killed; Captain J. H. Gary, Company A, Lucas' battalion, severely wounded; Private Isaac Campbell, Company G, First Volunteers, Georgia Regiment, slightly wounded; Private B. D. Elliott, Company A, Lucas' battalion, slightly wounded; Private John Collins, Company A, Twelfth Georgia Battalion, slightly wounded.

Several times during the day the enemy have attempted to repair the damage done their works by our fire last night, but each time I dispersed them by a shell from our sea-coast howitzer.

They opened fire on us about 15 minutes before 10 o'clock this morning, from a mortar boat lying alongside the Ironsides. From this and their land mortars, they have shelled us slowly until this time, the fire now being much slower than during most of the day. Considerable activity had been going on in the enemy's fleet this afternoon; some twenty barges took a load of troops from this island (lower end) to a large vessel lying seaward from the island.

No material damage has been done the battery by the enemy since last report. I kept the engineers at work, and repair about as rapidly as the enemy injure us. An almost constant fire has been kept up by our sharpshooters and those of the enemy, but with little or no
