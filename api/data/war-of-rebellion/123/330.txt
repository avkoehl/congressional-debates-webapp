telegram of July 21. You must not charge Ohio with the compulsory issue. They cannot be got back in time for present demand; 9,000 muskets will not arm ten regiments. These, now organizing, will number 980 men each. At least 15,000 will be ready to receive their arms in five days. There are 80,000 Springfields in Washington Arsenal. Why cannot Ohio have its quota of them now? None of them have ever been issued to the State. The Enfields sent here are not equal to Springfields. The last 10,000 were quite indifferent. I trust a liberal spirit will be manifested in this matter and that my requisition of 5th instant will be fully complied with.

By order of the Governor:

GEO. B. WRIGHT,

Quartermaster-General of Ohio.

HARRISBURG, August 8, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Volunteers are coming in rapidly. If we could assure counties that an excess of their quotas of the 300,000 volunteers called for can be credited to them on the proposed draft for militia, or that such draft will be only in such localities in the state which may fail to supply their quota by volunteering, such order would give fresh impetus to volunteering, and I think would avoid the necessity for a draft. I should be glad to have an immediate reply that I may answer the many inquiries on the subject. If you reply at once in the affirmative it would probably make a difference of 20,000 men in the next four or five days. I would also suggest the importance of immediate regulations for enrolling and drafting in the manner indicated by General Russell to General Buckingham.

Am very anxious to have answer to my dispatch of to-day.

His Excellency A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg:

The General Government calls only on the States for their quotas, leaving them to be apportioned among the counties by the Governors. It would be right in assigning their quotas to credit counties with any surplus they may have furnished. Regulations for enrolling and drafting will be furnished as soon as printed. Proceed with the enrollment as rapidly as possible. The quota for Pennsylvania of 300,000 is 45,321 for the draft; the same on the President's call for volunteers, to which add 2,199 deficiency in those heretofore sent to the field, making in all for both calls on the deficiency, 92,841, from which deduct all men furnished since May 27, 1862, for three years or
