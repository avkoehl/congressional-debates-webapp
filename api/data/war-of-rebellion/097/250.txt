ROSSING OF GRAVELLY RUN AND QUAKER ROD, March 29, 1865-2.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

General Griffin is getting slowly over the run. Bridge down. He reports that he has pushed past a grave-yard, but has not seen any chapel. General Meade desires you to push out toward him and send an officer to communicate with him. He seems to be puzzled about his position.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Copy to General Warren.)

P. S.-All moving now. Bridge built.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 29, 1865-4.50 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Griffin has been attacked by two divisions of the enemy. The staff officer was not able to find you and has been directed to order General Miles to go to Griffin's support in case he should overlap General Warren's right, but he is also ordered not to break up the connection with out right.

General Warren will attack at 6 p. m. The general commanding wishes you to support him with Miles at that hour, if you can spare Miles. Attack with your line at the same time if you can gain anything, but be sure to follow up Warren.
