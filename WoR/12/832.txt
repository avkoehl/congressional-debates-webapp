COLONEL: In obedience to instructions from you I started from camp at 9.30 o'clock last evening to do picket duty in front of the lines of this corps, having under my command the following companies of your regiment, viz: Company D, Lieutenant Howard commanding, 32 men; Company E, Captain Toomey, 50 men; Company F, Captain Leonard, 48 men; Company G, Captain Bliss, 48 men; Company H.
