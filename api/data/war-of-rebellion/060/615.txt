If successful, expects to be there by to-morrow p. m., March 1, and may the next day be in the vicinity of General Butler's outposts and pickets.

Your telegram has been forwarded to General Butler. No further information from East Tennessee of Longstreet's retreat, but it is thought there that he will rejoin Lee.

GARNETT'S MOUNTAIN, February 29, 1864-6 p. m.

Major-General NEWTON, and

CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER, Army of the Potomac:

No change in the enemy's position in our front. The enemy seems to be unaware of the move, as they are all very quiet. Some of their regiments have been drilling to-day.

WIGGINS,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,Robertson River, February 29, 1864-8 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Custer, with his command, moved forward at 2 o'clock this morning. The enemy, it appears, have no infantry on this side of the Rapidan, and very little if any cavalry. I have sent another brigade cross the river. The weather continues so hazy as to prevent signal communication. General Custer informs me that if he does not return by Wednesday morning it will be because he is cut off and compelled to seek another route, and that it will not be necessary for my command to remain here longer than Wednesday morning. Does the general commanding desire that I shall remain beyond that time if Custer does not return and I do not hear from him?

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General.
