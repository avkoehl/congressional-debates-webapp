HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 24, 1863.

Brigadier General R. B. MITCHELL:

The general commanding directs you to make careful examination of the right bank of the river opposite the present right flank of the rebel army, and find, if possible, commanding positions where you can plant batteries to enfilade the rebel lines and prevent their approach against the left of our line. It will be well for you to cut timber and open the way for observation of their position, and locate a battery or two at once, to annoy them. Report the result of your operations to this end as soon as practicable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Island Ferry, September 24, 1863.

General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in compliance with your orders to examine the right bank of the river and find a position to plant artillery, I have just returned and have found a position from which batteries can reach their camps. I have ordered up three pieces to that point, all I have that are available, the remainder of my artillery being stationed at the various fords along the river. I discovered two or three camps that can easily be reached.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
