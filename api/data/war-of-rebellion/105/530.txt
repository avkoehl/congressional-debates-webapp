LONG VALLEY, July 6, 1861.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquartrs Department of the Pacific:

SIR: I have just returned from Round Valley, where I went yesterday to inspect a detachment from Fort Brage. I found one sergeant and twelve privates encampeed at a point fourteen miles this side of the valley (they have been their about six weeks), and one corporal and one private at the valley. Several of the detachment have been on this duty two years and a half, and none less than eighteen months. Their services are of no vlue whatever where they are, and I recommend that they be immediately returned to their company.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. BUELL,

CAMP ON LARRABEE CREEK, July 9, 1861.

Captain CHARLES S. LOVELL,

Sixth Infantry, Commanding Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: I have reported to the department commander that I have advised the commanders of detachments in the field to make no more attacks on Indians except for depredations actually comitted, and I have no doubt the he will approve that course. The Shelter Cove Indians, however, have received no punishment for the murder of Lewis and Oliver, for which the whole band, according to all accounts, may fiarly be held reponsible. I have advised the commanding officer of Fort Bragg to take measures for the effectual punishment of that band, as it can perhaps be best undertaken by th troops that post.
