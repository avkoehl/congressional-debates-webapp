not allow him to put out pickets at all. I will try to accomplish the same all along. I can also do something in the way of reconnaissance in force toward the enemy's rear when it is desired to draw him off temporarily in that direction. I will also try to find a point of the enemy's line which can be broken.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 10, 1864.

Colonel ISRAEL GARRARD,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Kilpatrick with his force is on the opposite bank of the Chattahoochee, making a demonstration as if to cross at Sandtown, which he thinks will make the enemy's cavalry timid, and he desires you to feel across the Utoy Creek with as large a portion of your force as you can use for the purpose, and drive the enemy back, feeling as far in the direction of the right of General Hascall as you can get, and report as early as possible the result of your observations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

The major-general directs me to add that if you find on crossing the creek that it will be practicable for you to hold an advanced line from the right of the infantry to the Chattahoochee, he desires you will do so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 10, 1864.

General HOWARD:

I am going this morning to General Thomas' front to watch the effect of the new battery of 4 1/2-inch guns. All you can do is to keep your line of skirmishers up, so as to compel the enemy to keep his forts and main line full of men.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 10, 1864.

General HOWARD:

I hear General Brannan's guns and hear the shells burst in Atlanta. The shells that burst near you are from the enemy's big guns, which have been put in the fort at White Hall. Hood is anxious to draw our fire from the town to their fort at White Hall, which is of no value to us. Let us destroy Atlanta and make it a desolation.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
