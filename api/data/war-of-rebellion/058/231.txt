HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, January 27, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,Knoxville:

The enemy is evidently retiring from my front. Please report what he is doing in front of you.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS, Dickey's House, January 27, 1864-5 p. m.

Colonel McCook,Cavalry Division:

It will be impossible for the enemy to obtain water in his present position, so that he will be forced to fall back or fight to-morrow under unfavorable circumstances.

We must not let him rest. We are ordered to hold this country, and we must either drive him out or be driven out ourselves. We can drive him out, I think, if we can judge of to-morrow by the operations of to-day.

Please watch the road on your right. Wolford has two companies at the bridge.

Garrard is here.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Sevierville, January 27, 1864-5.50 a. m.

Colonel E. M. McCOOK:

COLONEL: I have directed Colonel Wolford to move upon at dawn to Flat Creek. I have ordered two howitzers to join him.

You will please attack the enemy in your front vigorously at daylight, and if you gain any advantage over him push him as hard as possible. Colonel La Grange is 1 1\2 miles in your rear, ready to act in any direction as the approach of day may render necessary.

Respectfully,S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
