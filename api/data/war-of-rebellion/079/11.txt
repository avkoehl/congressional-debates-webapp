NASHVILLE, October 1, 1864.

General SHOFIELD, Louisville:

The telegraph is working to Chattanooga, and I am trying to find out whether a train can get through. There seems to be no definite knowledge where Forrest is. Will advise you of everything important when known.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

ATLANTA, October 1, 1864.

General COX:

Let that DIVISION feel DIVISION to Flat Rock and not beyond. Howard has two DIVISIONS down toward Fairburn. I will send all of Kilpatrick's and Garrard's cavalry over to Powder Springs, and we will find out if Hood is drawing over to Alabama. I hop he will, for I think he makes a mistake, and I think I see how we can take advantage of it. Keep me advised of all symptoms. Forrest is now threatening Huntsville, and Thomas has sent there Morgan's DIVISION. Road and telegraph to Nashville all right yet.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

DECATUR, GA., October 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military DIVISION of the Mississippi, Atlanta:

Your dispatch of to-day received. You may rely on us for the heartiest and most earnest work in whatever direction we may go. Artillery horses and harness are much needed by our batteries, but in other respects we are in pretty good condition and full of the right faith.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., October 1, 1864.

General COX, Decatur, Ga.:

General Sherman directed you by telegraph to send to-day a DIVISION to Flag Rock in the matter of a reconnaissance, while General Howard sends to Fairburn, but to-morrow will answer for yours. This will enable you to understand his intention if you have not received his first message.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

DECATUR, October 1, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp, Atlanta:

The generals' first dispatch did not come to hand, and this made me uncertain of the meaning of the second. It is all understood now, and the DIVISION under orders to move.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
