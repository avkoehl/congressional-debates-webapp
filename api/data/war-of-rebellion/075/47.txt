RED CLAY, GA., May 6, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN, Ringgold:

Your dispatch is received. I will be ready to move to-morrow morning. Could move to-day if necessary. It will take several days to repair the railroad here, but I can get along until it is done. I have frequent communication with Howard.

General Thomas' man Seward says Polk's command gone to Rome.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Ringgold, Ga., May 6, 1864.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD:

I send dispatches by Major McCoy. Your movement should be by Thatcher's, Ellidge's Mill, where leave your rear guard, picketing through that gap to the east, and your head of column at Lee's, with cavalry and pickets out on the main road toward Varnell's as far as the hill, which is part of the Buzzard Roost near Sary's. I will be to-morrow about the Stone Church and Ringgold. Burke's Mill would be a good place for your wagons, which like Howard's could go empty by Parker's Gap to Ringgold and come to you by the shorter and direct road. Your cavalry should come down on the east of Tunnel Hill road to Sary's. The road from Ringgold to Varnell's is very good, and so are all the roads. If you bring 10,000 men it will be as much as I expect; the balance could be left at Red Clay to cover the approach of the troops behind and the wagons not yet up. Always show a bold front toward Varnell's, and communicate with Howard. Ringgold is your point of supply until we get Dalton, but repairs at Red Clay should go on.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
