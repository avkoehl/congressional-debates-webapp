(Received 9.10 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I shall get Ricketts' brigade off to-night, and take all the cars. Hartsuff's brigade must wait till morning, when the cars return. I have brought but the two brigades of infantry. Three batteries of artillery of my division and seven companies of cavalry General McDowell directed to come here by land via Dumfries. Is there not some mistake in this direction? If so, the artillery and cavalry should be met and sent aright. Ricketts' officers had to come here without their blankets. Can they not have one hundred from the hospital department here sent them?
