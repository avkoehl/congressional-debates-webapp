RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, August 1, 1863-3 a. m.

Brigadier General G. K. Warren,

Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac:

The Bridge at Kelly's Ford was completed by Lieutenant Mackenzie, Engineers, at 11. 30 last night. There was no opposition worth remark.

G. H. Mendell,

Captain of Engineers, Commanding Battalion.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION

August 1, 1863.

Major-General Meade:

I sent a brigade to cross this morning at Beverly Ford. The river is swimming, and I could not cross. The engineer give me no cooperation. I can cross in boats and drive away the rebs; after which, if the engineers are instructed to lay abridge, I can cross and hold the opposite bank. If I am to Advance, I would like to see some disposition shown to aid me. Everything seems to be awaiting orders.

JNO. Buford,Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
