war apainst this treaty to save hu> people and his
nation from ruin, but, sir, it is because the treaty,
as it is made, has placed it beyond his power to
pocktt the money, and convert it to his own and
the use of his fi lends It is, sir, because, by the
treat), the five millions and six hundred thousand
dollars agreed to be paid by this Government to the
Cherokee people for their lands, are appli=d mostly
to specific objects, and the balance per capita This
was a death blow to all his hopes—to all his ambi-
tion, and, sooner than let the last opportunity pass
through his hands to plunder his people, under the
sacr-d name of patriotism, he will put all upon the
hazard of thj die, even to the extermination of his
ra< e 4.nd, yet, sir, strange to tell, this man, Ross,
has won for himself, a reputation m portions cf this
country , ard can c immand the support of the first
talents in the nation, upon the ground that all he
has done, and is now doing, is for the good of his
people
But, Mr Chairman, to give something more than
my assertions for the opinions I here expressed, I
will again advert to fuither remarks of Ross and
the odiers in the same letter.   They say
1 In yom letter of the 7ih instant, closing ill timber inter
co irse in writing between us, you disti ctly informed us that
theapplicatio i if the five millions wh chis offered for our lands
east of the Mis^issir pi river will be sue as we desire—a just
i esard being h" 1 lo individual lights Well then, if the nation
will con=en 'o treat and accept of the sum offered let its own
wishes in regard to the application be consulted and adopted—
ajust regard hems had to inchmdualnghls And on the part
of ihe dt Ie«-itioi here, we again repeat that we are prepared to
comply n good f th, wi h aiy promise we have made to the
D par mem on the s bjeel Pro%ided you do the same on your
pat, and will not throw any obstacles in our way '
Such, sir, is the language of that communication
addre^ed to the Secretary of War in March, 1835,
after all efforts to get them to treat had failed in this
city
Now, Mr Cha.rman, is there an unprejudiced
man heie or elsewhere that can affect to misunder-
stand John Ross in thus violating his pledges' He
had got from the Senate their utmost limit they
would go. He was bound to accept it for himself
and his colleagues, at least This he evades, and,
finally, t hen the corespondence was closed, he
and his friends refusing to treat, they then use the
insolent language to this Government tint they will
comply, n good faith, with their promise, "pon-
ded ' the Government will throw no obstacle in their
waj , and the mon y be applied as trey may desire
Sir, ihe English of -Ml this is ten i'l t ike a treaty
if} on will let us have our own u ay We wtd le
turn to our people, and, instead of taking the re-
sponsibtl ty of cheating them here, where, if we do
so, we may be detected, ive will return to our na-
tion, call our people together, and maks them cheat
themselves
If, Mr Chairman, there is still any doubt on the
mind of -ny gentleman as to th  motives o*" John
Ros'', subsequent events, as they occurre 1 m the
Cheiokee nation during lhs summer and fall of
1835, w ll remove them It is well known to this
House nd l^e country that the President appoint
p<J fio Commissionels (Mr Schermerhorn and Go
vernor Carroll) on the part of this Government to
repair to the Cherokee country to conclude the
treity *v th the Chetokee people The correspon-
dence 'hat took p'are bpfween the Commissioners
and Ross, fully sustains the charge that his object
\\ as to prevent a treaty in the nation, by submitting
the question directly and fairly to the sense of the
C íeroVee pe p'e, but, by various pretexts, he pre-
vented the United States Commissioners from all
oppoitunity of presenting their piojet, until he had
succ e led 11 preparing their minds against a tteaty,
but, it the same time, had secured to himself, and
the tteieafitton associated with him, unlimited pow-
er over the question of the treaty, which poaer,
under the grant, was made urevocable
This w as a part of the master policy of this Che-
rokee diplomatist, and it was not until he hid se-
cured himself in this tieau-making poner, even
beyond the r ach of hts own people, rnak ng him-
self, and the delegition appointed to act yvtth him,
whom every body knows to be his creatuies,
greater than the Cherokee nation, and beyond its
control and reach, that he ever would recognise
Mr Soharmerhoi n as the Go-vernment agent It
is a matter of curious inquiry to see with what re-
markable address this man Ross—at tunes s>o plau-
sible, his motives and designs so admirably
veiled, that the most icrutmizing eye would pass
them undetected—carried on his schemes to their
final consummation. Sir, he was an overmatch
for the balance of his nation, and has baffled lor
years the public agents and the humane policy of
this Government. But in his march, adroit and
skilful as it was, he has left traces that enable us
to identify the spirit, the motive, and the objeet
As far back as the 7lh of July, 1835, Mr. Scher-
merhorn addressed John Ross, from which I make
the following extract
"I hope this, however, will not prevent you from convening
your principal mm at such time and place as you think, best,
to give me an opportunity of an interview with them, for the
purpose mentioned in our personal interview "
This letter was followed by another from Mr.
Schermerhorn on the 9th July, of the most concili-
atory character On the 10th July, Governor Car-
roll and Schermerhorn addressed Mr. Ross, in-
forming him that they much regretted to learn he
had prevented the census from being taken of the
Cherokees east This letter was answered by John
Ross on the 12'h, denying his interference On the
24th Jnly, John Ross addressed a letter to Mr.
Schermerhorn, declining to meet him and Governor
Carrol! one week from the 29th of that month, for
the purpose of holding a conference on the subject
of their mission Ross assigns a3 reasons, the
trouble and inconvenience of the measure, and
other causes, none of which can be considered
valid On the 29th of Jul}, Governor Carroll and
Schermerhorn addressed Ross, calling upen him
distinctly to state if he intended to comply with his
engagements to submit the question of tht treaty to
the Cherokees They further say that " they are
altogether ignorant of the course pursued by j ou
and jour principal men after leaving the council
ground last week, and the speeches you made them,
and the advice that was given not to meet the Com-
missioners here at this time " It will be remem-
bered that this letter bears date at the time and
place the United States Commissioners expected to
meet John Ross, and all the Cherokees, on the sub-
ject of the treaty They did not meet them, how-
ever, and Ross, m reply to the above letter, under
date 30th July, urged the same reasons he had done
in a former letter Here, then, it was made mani-
fest lh?t Ross had certain object' to accomplish
with his people, before he would suffer them to meet
m council Nearly one month had elapsed, and
no advance was y et made by Ross to convene his
people, and had actually refused himself to meet
them at the time and place appointed Th's nego-
tiation was suspended from July to 14th October,
1835, when Mr Schermerhorn addressed " the
chiefs, head men, and warrics of the Cherokee In-
dians, m genera) council CLnvened, at Red Clav
Council Ground," apptisti g fhpm of his attendance,
and readiness and desire of opening the negociation
for a treaty on the five million basis recommended
by the Senate On the 15th October, the Committee
and Ouncil adopted the following resolution
Resulted That they see no reason for departing fron   the
customary foims of the nat on m common cation** of ib s n
ture  and iheref  re they return the letter of Mr Schermerh
to the principal ch *f with the desire tía  he will (toTt ! r
with the Exec itive Counci ) answer the aforesaidletler m * ich
manner as they mav think advisable   and  hat the Committee
of Council wi 1 act upon the result
Well, sir, the principal chief, John Ross, with
Lowrey, Waters, and Lewis Ross, straightway an-
swer the letter John Ro«s had now gained all he
wished He was invested with plenary power, and
they, in their letter, express a wish to hear the pro-
position, but remind Mr Schermerhorn that the
Senate's basis had been rejected, and "how unne-
cessary it will be again to ask the sentiments of th 
people upon the treaty you have alreadv proposed,
and to which they have altogether objected If,
however (it goes on to say,) you are fully autho-
rized to offer any new terms, they shall be faithfully
and prompl'v attended *o " This last letter «a?,
on the 17th CctoT er, answered bv Mr S<*hermer-
liom, in another addressed to "The chiefs, het'-
men, and warriors," reminding them of their inte-
rest, the obligations that Ross and his party weie
under to submit the matter to a council of the na-
tion, and to recommend its adoption to his people
On ths 22d of the same month, while fh¿ council
was yet in session, John Ross addresses "The Com-
mittee and Council," m which he distinctly recom-
mends to appoint a delegation, with powers to treat
with the United States at Washington, if, as he be-
lieved was the fact, it should turn out that there
was no person authorized to treat with them on the
ground. On the 24th of October, the Council of
Red Clay, of 1,076 individuals,
"Resolved That a delation, consisting of John Ross, prill
cipal chief, Richard Taylor, Lewis Ro«a, James Brown, James
Daniel Thomas Foreman Richard Held? Sleeping Rabbit,
Joseph Vann, John Burge, Ooternawa, Elijah Hicks, John
Huss, JohnF Baldndge Peter of Aquohee, Jesse Busheyhead,
John Ri Ige, Ellas Boudmot, and Charles Vann, be endowed
with full powers to enter into an arrangement with the Gen 
rat Government of the United States, for the final adjustment
of the existing difficulties of the Cherokee nation, upon such
ba^es and terms as may be deemed by them best fitted to se
cure the peace and future security of the Cherokee people "
In the last resolution adopted at the same time,
they resolve
" \nd that we forbid any negotiation through any other per
sons, and will not hold ourselves bound by he proceedings of
any (other) delegation'   &c
Mr Chairman, it is under this authority that
Ross and his party now allege that the treaty is
null, because not made by the competent persons.
By whom was the treaty of New Echota made1?
By John Ridge, Elias Boudmot, members of this
very committee, and eighteen others, influential
men, of known character among the chiefs Why
was it made in Cherokee? Because Ross and his
friends would not conclude a treaty at Washington
¡n the preceding March, alleging that he must take
the sense of their people; that it must be submitted
to them Well, sir, he was then distinctly notified
that he need never again return to Washington to
effect a treat}, that if there should ever be a treaty
concluded it must be done m the nation Ross
was again and again reminded of this by Scher
merhorn Nevertheless, we see him, after having
himself and friends invested with power, not by a
majority of the nation, for the documents show
that the Senate basis of five millions was rejected
m open council by only 1076, and that the samo
number ratified and confirmed the delegation of
Ross and others, and protested at tne same time
against any other delegation disposing of their
land , did succeed fiist in rejecting the five millions
by less than one sixth of the whole nation, and by
less than one sixth of the whole nation caused him-
self and friends to be invested with power to treat
then and through all time. A minority is compe-
tent, it seems, to authorize Ross and his party to
sell their country, but a majority is reqjired to
make the sale of Ridge, Boudmot, and others-bind-
ing Yes, sir, the treaty of New Echota is now
denounced as a foul blot on our national character,
conceived in fiaud, consummated
a minority,
and th refore a ntilli'v, which the honesty of the
ration shoul 1 repudiate, in all honest men decry
Yet, sn, those who ho d this language, whose deli-
cate sensibility is so aroused at the very name of
this treaty of New Cchota, are prepared to enter
into a treaty wth Ross a"d his part), who them-
selves r=p e e t i ii i i v cH  than one sixth
\nd, sir, I a tí ií i r-at, vas row made, oi had
been made, bv R > s an ' hts party, would it not
have been liable to the \ ry same objections now
i rged to this tteat^ How can you draw the dis-
tinction'! If i minority < f ihe Cherokees are compe-
tent to invest a delegation with treaty making
powers, is not the same, or even a greater minori-
ty, upon the same principle, equally competent to
make a treaty themseh es1
This, sir, brings us to another remaika^o inci-
dent m this affair The records show that
Ross and his friends here in Washington, af-
ter the news of the treaty reached them, were
enib el, from some 'ime m the early part of
January to 3d of February, to present to the
Señale two protests against the ratificat on of
the treitv, one ot 3 250 signers, the other 14 910,
mak ng 18,160 This is a circumstance I leave
for Ross and his friends to explain Can any
min beii"ve it possible that in one month's
t me, or less, in the midst of winter, among
mountains ->nd snows, eighteen thousand one
hundred and sixty persons in the Cherokee coun-
try could have been seen, their names got to these
protests and 'ransmitted from the Cherokee coun-
try to this city1 Tne thing is impossible There
were not, at that time, as many Cherokees m the
