Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I ordered the brigade of regular troops to New York two days ago. The force sent there from this place will number about 1,200 in all. In addition to this General Dix was directed to retain the Seventh Infantry, which had been previously ordered here. Do you not think this sufficient force?

U. S. GRANT,

Major General H. W. HALLECK,Chief of Staff:

Is there no officer in Augur's department to take his place and let him return to the command of the department?

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

WINCHESTER, VA., November 1, 1864-10 a.m. [Received 9 p.m.]

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have nothing new to report. I have made cavalry demonstrations up the Luray Valley and up the main valley, to prevent any concentration on Augur in taking up the road. Nothing new was developed. Found some rebel cavalry at Milford, in Luray Valley, and nothing north of Mount Jackson, in the main valley. There cannot be anything but Mosby's forces to annoy Augur.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
