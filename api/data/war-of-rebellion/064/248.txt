his way up to North Missouri with 200 or 300 men, through your section. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time in regard to affairs on the border.

Yours, respectfully,

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Through the treachery of the jailer at this place, and the stupidity, or something worse, of the militia on duty here, 7 notorious villains were permitted to escape yesterday. In the pursuit of them, 2 of the rascals have been killed and 1 wounded. I hope to serve the balance the same way. Am organizing the militia as rapidity as possible. Trouble is reported in Chariton County, and I have sent sufficient force there to put it down.
