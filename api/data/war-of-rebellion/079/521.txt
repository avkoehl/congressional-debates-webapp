Major-General THOMAS:

The following telegram is just received:

CENTRE STAR, October 29, 1864-8 p. m.

(Via Pulaski 30th.)

It is reported that Hood's entire army reached Town Creek to-day and expects to cross the river at Bainbridge to-night. I have this from such source that I cannot doubt its truth. I will do what I can to prevent their crossing.

JNO T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.

DECATUR, ALA., October 30, 1864-8. 35 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Shall I send any more force to Athens than the balance of artillery? Had re-enforcements already sent [sic] more cannot be accommodated in the fort and would only be in his way. I think the garrison now ample and as much as could be advantageously used before the arrival of General Stanley. Officer commanding my picket at Elk River Station, above Lamb's Ferry, reports that he heard beating of drums and blowing bugles on opposite side of river; thinks the enemy moving down with the intention of crossing at Blue Water. This confirms report of General Croxton. Operator at Pleasant Grove reports hearing artillery firing in that direction. The Stone River left here this eve at 3 p. m. for Whitesburg. Colonel Lyon just reports enemy on Meridianville road, coming down toward Huntsville. Do not know their strength; suppose it is Mead with the 300 which crossed above, now about 700 strong. I go up at once with 400 men.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 30 1864-9 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

The following dispatch is just received:

HUNTSVILLE, October 30, 1864-7. 30 p. m.

A courier from Whitesburg is just in with the following dispatch from Lieutenant-Colonel Hudson, the commanding officer there: "We were attacked with artillery at 6 p. m. The boat Thomas and one battery opened up and gave them a lively tune. I think the rebels had about four guns. " They are, from all indications, crossing the river two or three miles below, as the courier says that the firing had ceased when he left. He also says that the report from below was that the rebels were working busily on the other side and not [that] they were actually making the attempt to cross. I presume Colonel Hudson has sent re-enforcements to the threatened point. I am sending order by courier for him to do so. Lieutenant-Colonel Horner left Whitesburg at 2 o'clock this p. m., and from the best information he could get there was only the usual force of rebels in that vicinity. We have about 650 men and three pieces of artillery.

WM. P. LYON,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier-General.
