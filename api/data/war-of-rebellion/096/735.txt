The command will march to-morrow (the 1st of March, 1865,) at 6 a.m. The following order of march will be observed: First, First Division; second, wagon and pontoon train; third, Third Division.

Division commanders will take especial care to keep their respective commands well closed. The leading division will regulate their pace so as to accommodate itself as much as possible to the pace of the wagon train. Division commanders will observe that all roads leading in from the flanks on the line of march are occupied and watched by detachments sufficiently strong for the purpose. The detail from the leading division will perform this duty until relieved by detail from Third Division. Impress on the minds of all advance or flanking parties that it is of the utmost importance that all information possible be gained of the movements of the enemy. Such information will be sent to these headquarters with the least possible delay.
