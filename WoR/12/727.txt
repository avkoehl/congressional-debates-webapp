
General Butterfield being ill, the undersigned took command of the brigade and marched it to camp, leaving Hanover at 3.30 p.m., but in consequence of detections made by the troops and trains ahead did not arrive in camp until 3.30 a.m. At this morning's roll call all were present, although half my command had marched some 30 miles. Both officers and men behaved nobly, without an exception. As the result of the engagement I have to report none known to be killed or wounded; 8 missing. There were no dead buried by this regiment.

Respectfully submitted.

Respectfully,
