make such arrangements with above view as your judgement shall dictate. A like dispatch has been sent to Lieutenant-General Longstreet.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

[APRIL 29, 1863.]

[General LONGSTREET:]

The following dispatch has just been received from General Lee:

The enemy is in large force in north bank of Rappahannock, opposite the railroad, at Hamilton's Crossing. He is crossing below the point at which he crossed in December, and extends lower down the river. I have discovered nothing lower than the mouth of Massaponax Creek. He is certainly crossing in large force here, and it looks as if he was in earnest. I hear of no other point at which he is crossing, expect below Kelly's Ford, where General Howard has crossed with his division, said to be 14,000, six pieces of artillery, and some cavalry. Stoneman will probably cross about the Warrenton Springs, and I fear will make for Gordonsville and may destroy our roads, I have nothing to oppose to all that force up there except the two brigades of cavalry under General Stuart. All available troops had better be sent forward as rapidly as possible by rail and otherwise.

R. E. LEE.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

RICHMOND, VA., April 29, 1863.

General LONGSTREET,

Franklin, Va., near Blackwater:

I have sent dispatch you by messenger more in detail. Be prepared to move your command in accordance with that dispatch with the least practicable delay.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, Va., April 29, 1863.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET:

The following telegram just received since the one already communicated to you:

If any troops can be sent by rail to Gordonsville under a good officer I recommend it. Longstreet's division, if available, had better to me, and the troops for Gordonsville and the protection of the railroad from Richmond and North Carolina if practicable. General Howard, of the enemy's forces, making toward Gordonsville, has six batteries with him. Please order the forwarding of supplies.

The Secretary, in view of the above, directs the return of your command, or at least such portion of it as can be spared without serious risk; also any surplus force that can be spared from General D. H. Hill. Rhett's command has been sent to Gordonsville. These movements are required to be made with the utmost dispatch.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
