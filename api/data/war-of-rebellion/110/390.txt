guided by a good Providence, will enable you so to provide for a successful resistance that we may not be called upon to lament its fall. The spirit of its people, evoked by the gallantry of the general in charge, finds its response in generous appropriations of money and means by our Legislature, which also sanctions the devotion of its citizens by resolutions inciting generous sacrifice and a determination that the enemy shall find but a mass of ruins over which to gloa, if he, unfertunately for us, should succeed in obtaining its possission. A copy of these resolutions will be forwarded to you that may be apprised of the feeling of our citizens*. In the capture of Mobile we feel that we would be shorn of our pride and lose much of our stength of resistance, yet the spirit of our people will not quail if thereby a greater good can be accomplished elsewhere and results attained which tend more surely to the defeat of the enemy and the acoomplishment of our great mutual aim-the establishment of our Confederacy. Upon the approach of the inclement season now at hand, notwithstanding the expressed desire of the enemy for a winter capmaign, will not the frots and mud make that impossible, except in the immediate vicinity of the railroads and rivers, and will he not be left with his armies incative in the mud of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and for the same reason out of the reach of the forces which we would desire to bring to his attack? And will he not concentrate the strength of his land and naval force against our sea-board cities and move upon our sandy, accessible coasts?

I am aware that present indications at the North, in the Cabinet, and the armies of our enemies show that they are sincere in their wish to press on, notwithstanding the elements and the soil forbid and advance, but the obstacles to the movement of troops in the States which I have named to me too great for any but the insane to undertake such an enterprise. I would not, however, on this account abate on jot of preparation to meet his advance and, if possible, overwhelm him on the first false movement. I believe our troops as capable of endurance as his own, and their spirits as far more uncounquerable as our cause is higher and holier. But with these natural impediments to the advance of the enemy upon our nothern bordere, I trust you will pardon what, but for any anxiety for the defense of an aknowledged important position, might seem presumption, in the suggestion that perhaps the legion now commanded by Colonel Hillard might possibly be spared from Tennessee for the defense of Mobile. The cavalry belonging to is has for some time been separeted from the main command, and as such are not needed, while the artillery, now recuded to one company, and the infantry would add material strength to the defense. I suggest this particular corps on acount of its peculiar organization, and the fact that is is alrgely composed of South and Middle Alabamias, who would feel in defending Mobile that they were fighting for the very key to their own homes and families. While there is no Mobile company in the crops, the men from the river and inland counties would feel the peculiar importance of the position. I plafce the suggestion before you, however, with all deference to your superior means of information and military knowledge. I regret that the enrollment in Alabama has been so barren of results, an assure you it had not so been from causes within my control. To it I have been able to give nothing but moral influence, which, practically, could no acce State militia laws made of sufficient provision for enrollment, and the severe
