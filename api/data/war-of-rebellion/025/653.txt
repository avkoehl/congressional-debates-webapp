HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE FORCES, Tupelo, Miss., July 21, 1862.

Colonel M. L. CLARK,Chief of Artillery:

COLONEL: The field artillery of the Army of the Mississippi has been ordered to move by land on Chattanooga via Aberdeen, Columbus, Tuscaloosa, Talladega, and Rome, Ga., with the least delay practicable. It is the wish of the general that this move should be made in the most efficient manner possible, and he thinks it best that you should accompany and assume immediate command of the artillery while in movement. It is the wish of the general as you pass Columbus that you should exchange inferior horses for the best that are in the batteries there.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

RICHMOND, VA., July 21, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG, Tupelo, Miss.:

General Magruder has been relieved by General Holmes in command of the Trans-Mississippi Department. It is presumed the latter will pass by Tupelo. Have telegraphed General Holmes that you have important information to communicate.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Communications and orders continue to reach me to and from the Trans-Mississippi Department. Is it not a separate command, independent of this?
