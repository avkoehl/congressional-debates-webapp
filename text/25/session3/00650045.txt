So the House refused to lay the petition on the
table, and it was then referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs
Mr WISE said,being in a minority of thirty-
two, he gave up the fight, and withdrew his
motion made yesterday to reconsider the same
reference of a similar petition presented by Mr.
Greknfll
Pttitions and memorials, chiefly on the subject
of abolition, &c , were presented by Messrs.
LINCOLN, I-LETCHER, HAS1INGS, CAL-
HOUN, and SALTONSTALL, of Massachu-
setts
Mr SALTONSTALL presenting a petition
similar to the others in relation to Hayti,
Mr LEGARE objectid to its reception, and
went on to point out the distinction between a
bona fide petition asking, as a commercial ques-
tion, foi the interchange of lelations between the
two countries, and those fiom the Abolitionists,
sol up for the pui pose of subserving the ends and
designs they had in view Mi L then aigued
that the Constitution did not prohibit the House
fiom refusing; to íeceive a petition, any more than
by giving full fieedom of speech it authotized
licentiousness of speech or blasphemy, and cited
various cases in suppoit of this giound, in the
Btitish Paiharm nt,fiom " Hatsell'sPiecedents "
Mi   CUSHMAN then said that, at the late
they were going on, no business would be done
duiing the session, and, to aid ill progiessmg it, I
he demandtd the piCMous question, but it was 1
not sustained by the House—ayes 66, noes 7l)
Mi PETRIKIN then mo-sed that the House
adjourn   lost—75 to 89
Mr SALTO^STALL then proceeded to re-
ply to Mi Legate, and denied the imagined con
nection winch lhat gentleman had contended for
He also denied the powei of the House to íefuse
to leceivt any and all petitions whose Lnguage
was in respectful terms, and cited the amendment
of the Constitution on this subjtct to show lhat
the light of petition had been secured to the peo-
ple on the bioadtst possible ground In the pres-
ent case, lie insisted, the petitioners asked only
for a legitimate object, an object within the power
of Conffiess, and whichCoieress had repeatedly
acted on heietofore in samilai cases He again j
denied that this  subject was connecti d with that
of abolition, thou^ti he was ptepaied t> meet the
latter, and txpicssedahope that the lime was not
far distant when tli it question would be mil and
dthbeiately and calmly discussed, both by the
North and the ^ou h
Mi HARRISON then renewed the motion to
