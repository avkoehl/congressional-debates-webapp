lishmg the temtorial government of Wisconsin,
(limiting the tenure of the offices of Governor,
secietary, marshal, and attorney to two yeais,

Mi ADAMS inquired the object of the pro-
posed change
Mr DOTY explained that it was to hold to a
gieater and more fiequent accountability, and to
assimilate the periods of set vice to those of sim-
ilar officers in the States
Mr ADAMS insisted that its effect would be
to lender the G-overnois moie dependent on Ex
ecutive powei and influence Mr A rr^ed to
stnke out the first section of the bill
Mr BRONSON disclaimed any such intention
on the part of the committee who íepoited the
bill, and the inference was rather the reverse, 01
at least to bung about a more dnect responsibility
to the people among whom the officeis resided
Mi POPE was unwilling to make any change
in a system which had hitherto worked well
enough, and no complaints had yet been heard
of the Governor of Wisconsin
Mi BRONSON could assure the committee
that no intention existed to reach the existing
Govei nor of Wisconsin, for the bill was so drafted
as to take effect only on the expiration of Gov-
ernor Dodge's tetm
Mr DOTY defended the provisions of the bill
with much earnestness, and showed the necessity
of a change and a more frequent removal from
the negligence of some of the officers
The amendment was disagreed to, and the bill
was laid aside

of a pier on Lake Winnebago, which was con-
sidered and laid aside

On motion of Mr EVANS, the committee took
up the bill to authouze the importation, free of
duty, of the iron materials of certain iron ves-
sels, and, after some discussion between Messrs.
KEMBLE, EVANS, NAYLOR.and ADAMS,
The CHAIRMAN decided that the bill did not
fall within the special order
Mr ADAMS appealed from that decision, on
the ground that a portion of it had reference to
the Territory of Florida—the second section.
After a few further remarks from Messrs.
DOWNING, LINCOLN, EVANS, BRON-
SON, and CAMBRELENG, the bill was laid
aside, to have the question decided in the House.
The committee then took up the " bill m rela-
tion to the town of Southport, Wisconsin "
The question was on the substitute submitted
by Mr Dot's, on Satuid iv last, which he now
moved
Mr LINCOLN opposed the bill, and also the
substitute, and moved that the bill bo laid aside,
not to be reported
Mr DOTY earnestly advocated the bill, citing
vaiious acts of legislation by which Congress
had absolutely donated the proceeds of the sales
of town lots to the inhabitants theieof, wheieas
this bill only provided that the money should be
paid into the Tieasury, and laid out in the con-
I struction of the haibor of Southpoit, leaving the
I selection of the point, too, to the discretion of
! the Secretary of War
