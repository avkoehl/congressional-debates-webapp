ages on the mails conveyed. Heretofore the
steamers employed in this service received as
' compensation the gross amount of United States
postages upon the correspondence transported,
' Without allowing for the expenses of the inland
' service; but as no contracts were executed with
' the-Department, calling for the performance of a
' Specified number of trips, according to a fixed
;,techedule of sailing days, and as the mails they
' conveyed received no greater care or attention
while in transit than is ordinarily given to first-
class freight, it was considered by my predecessor
proper that the compensation for the sea portion
<of the service should be so adjusted as to prevent
' loss to the postal revenues; and arrangements
• Were accordingly.concluded by him with the pro-
prietors of all tne steamship lines, except two,
plying between New York and Havana, for a
fixed compensation by the trip of $125 each way,
or $250 per round trip, if not exceeding the Uni-
ted States postages on the mails conveyed. The
proprietors of two of the steamship lines in ques-
tion declined to accede to this rate of compensa-
• tidn, claiming that they were entitled to the gross
amount of postages under the provisions of the
fourth section of the act of June 15, 1860, which
authorizes the Postmaster General to cause the
mails to be transported between the United States
and any foreign port or ports, by steamships, al-
lowing therefor the sea and inland postage if by
an American vessel, and the sea postage only if
by a foreign vessel. The provisions of this sec-
tion have not been constiued by this Department
as requiring the Postmaster General to allow the
sea and inland postages on the mails conveyed, to
all American vessels, but simply as limiting the
• compensation in any case to that amount.
The payment of $1250 per round trip,limited to
the postages, having been generally accepted by
the proprietors as ample remuneration for the
steamship service between New York and Ha-
vana, no reason occurs to me why it should not
be adopted as the uniform compensation for all
• the steamships employed on that route.
As doubts have arisen relative to the proper
• construction of the fourth and fifth sections of die
act of the 14th of June, 1858, und the fourth sec-
tion of the act of the 15th of June, J8G0, which,
in effect, superseded the last-mentioned section, 1
recommend additional legislation authorizing the
Postmaster General to cause the mails to be trans-
ported-between the United Stales and any foreign
port or ports, or between ports of the United
States touching at a foreign port, by steamship,
allowing and paying therefor, if by an American
vessel, any sum not exceeding the sea and United
States inland postage, and if by a foreign vessel,
" any sum not exceeding the sea postage on the mails
«o conveyed.
To protect the postal revenue from losses inci-
dent to the unauthorized conveyance of letters by
- private ships or vessels departing from tiie United
States for foreign countries, 1 recommend the pas-
sage of a law requiring, as a condition of clearance,
that the master or commander of any steamship
or other vessel departing for a foreign port or
ports, shall make oath or affirmation that he has
not received on board his ship or vessel, and has
not under his care or within Ins control, any letters
addressed to a foreign country which have not
been received directly from the post office at the
port of departure, except such as are directed to
the consignee of the ship or vessel.
The United States postages upon the corre-
spondence exchanged with Central and South
America, via Aspinwufl and Panama, amounted
to $14,208 51, all of which was paid to Cornelius
Vanderbilt for the sea and isthmus transporta-
tion.
The provisions of article three of the United
States and Canada postal convention have been
so modified, by agreement between the respective
post departments, as to abolish the international
letter postage of fifteen cents .per single rate, here-
tofore levied upon letters passing- between Canada
and California, Oregon, and Washington Terri-
tory, thus establishing a uniform international
postage for letters of ten cents the single rate,
prepayment optional, between Canada and all
parts of the United States, without regard to dis-
-tance or route of conveyance; and the benefit of
the same uniform international rate of ten cents
has also been extended to the correspondence ex-
changed with the province of New Brunswick.
Our arrangement with Canada adopts the prin-
ciple of optional prepayment, in both countries,
of the com bined rate of international postage, each
country retaining all the postage which it collects.
It is the most simple form of international postal
arrangement, inasmuch as it dispenses entirely
with accounts between the respective post depart-
ments, and has been adopted with all the other
provinces exceptNewfoundiand. With the view
of securing uniformity in our postal relations with
those provinces, a recent effort was made to ob-
tain the concurrence of Newfoundland in a like
arrangement, which I regret to say was unsuc-
cessful; the British post department declining to
give its assent to the measure, on account of the
additional British packet postage of fourpence
sterling which is levied for the sea service to and
from the island, and accrues to Great Britain.
The initiatory steps taken to conclude similar
postal arrangements with the colonies of Vancou-
ver's Island and British Columbia, referred to in
the last annual report, have not as yet been at-
tended with the. success anticipated.
Additional articles to the United States and
British postal convention have been agreed upon,
constituting the British packet agency at Colon
an office for the exchange of mails with the post
office ofNew York, by means ofthe United States
packets plying between those ports; the object
being to prevent the delay to correspondence for-
warded from the United States to ports and places
'on the Atlanticcoastand interiorofNew Granada,
picviously caused by its transit across the Isth-
mus to and from Panama. A copy of these arti-
cles is annexed, (No. 8.)
An arrangement has also been concluded forex-
pediting the transmission to destination of unpaid
letters addressed to the United States, received at
Panama by British packets from countries on the
west coast of South America; this Department
agreeing to collect,and account to Groat Britain,
through the office of the British packet agency at
Panama, for the unpaid postage charged thereon.
An additional article to the United States and
Bremen, and to the United States and Hamburg
conventions, respectively, was executed on the
28th of March last, aiuhoi lzmg the conveyance of
the international correspondence in time of war,
or threatening war, by steamships sailing under
neutral flag, whenever the same cannot be safely
conveyed by United States, Bremen, or Hambuig
steamships. Copicsaie annexed, (Nos.Oand 10.)
In view of the apprehension then felt that the war
pending in the not th of Europe might interrupt the
mail service so long and advantageously performed
by the Bremen ami Hamburg lines of mail packets,
steps were taken to ascertain whether the neutral-
ity of the said steameis might not be secured by
means of diplomatic correspondence, but this De-
partment has not been advised of the result. Our
postal conventions with Great Britain and Mexico,
respectively, recognize the principle that, even in
time of war between the contracting parties, their"
respective mail packets shall continue their naviga-
tion without impediment or molestation until six
weeks after a notification given by either of the
two Governments, and delivered to the other, that
the service is to be discontinued; and as all Gov-
ernments have a common interest m claiming ex-
ceptional treatment for mail packets in case of
war, to the end of maintaining regularity in in-
ternational postal communication, it is a subject
worthy of consideration whether, by treaty stip-
ulations between nations or otherwise, alike prin-
ciple might not be established between all Gov-
ernments, with proper safeguards against the
transportation of persons or articles contraband
of war.
During the past year a new line of French mail
packets has been established between France and
the United States, the steamships plying, for the
present, direct between Havre and New York,
and making regular departures from each port,
on Wednesday of every fourth week. TheUnited
States exchange offices of New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia,dispatch and receive mails regularly
by means of this line, corresponding with the
French exchanging offices of Paris and Havre, and
with the French mail agent embarked on board
of each packet.
This Department has also concluded an arrange-
ment for the transportation of the mails, fort-
nightly, between Boston and Halifax, Canso,
and Pictou, (Nova Scotia,) and Charlottetown,
(Prince Edward's Island,) the proprietors of the
steamer to receive, as full compensation for the
sea service, a moiety of the United States post-
ages on the mails conveyed.
A correspondence has been opened with several
of the post departments represented by commis-
sioners at the Paris international postal confer-
ence, having for its object the negotiation of postal
conventions, on the basis of the Paris resolutions,
with those countries on the continent of Europe
with which the United States has hitherto sus-
tained no direct postal relation, as well as for the
revision and amendment of existing postal con-
ventions, so as to make them conform as nearly
as practicable to the liberal principles of postal
progress recommended by that conference as the
basis of international arrangements. Favorable
responses have been received from the several
post departments interested in this subject.
In conformity with the provisions of the act" to
authorize the establishment of ocean mail steam-
ship service between the United States and Bra-
zil, " approved May 28, 1864, an advertisement
was issued inviting proposals for carrying the
mails of the United States by a monthly line of
first-class American sea-going steamships, be-
tween a port of the United States north of the
Potomac river, and Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil,
touching at St. Thomas, in the West Indies, and
at Pernambuco and Bahia, in Brazil, for a con-
tract term often years,to commenceon or before
the 1st day of September, 1865, and to date from
the day the first steamship of such line shall leave
the United States with the mails for Brazil.
Three proposals were received for this service,
the lowest and the accepted bid being that of the
New York, Nuevitas, and Cuba Steamship Com-
pany, with Thomas Asencio & Co. and Manuel
J. Mora, of New York, as guarantors, for the per-
formance of the required service, at the sum of
$240,000 per an num, to be divided equally between
the two Governments.
The act authorizing the establishment of this
line of American steamships was the beginning of
a new era in the history of our ocean mail service,
which is being performed principally by steamers
sailing under foreign flags. The Government, by
this measure, adopted the policy of cooperating
with the individual enterprise of our citizens m
establishing a direct mail steamship communica-
tion with the principal country of South America,
with the object of providing a reliable and speedy
transmission of correspondence, and developmga
profitable commerce, legitimately belonging to us
by reason of our geographical position, but which
has been diverted into other channels by means
of regular steamship communications with other
countries not so favorably situated as ours for con-
ducting an extensive trade with Brazil.
At piesent our only regular and reliable route
of postal communication with Brazil anil adja-
cent South American States is by the circuitous
route via Great Britain or France, each of those
countries maintaining a subsidized line of mail
steamers plying to and from Rio de Janeiro, estab-
lished nominally for postal purposes, but really in
the interest of commerce, which is fostered and de-
veloped by regular mail steam ship communication.
There are other ocean routes besides the one to
Brazil, which can be safely and profitably occu-
pied by American lines of mail steamers, among
which the route between San Francisco, Japan,
and China, at presentunoecupied by foreign mail
packets, is perhaps the most important in a com-
mercial point of view, and may be made available
in securing to us a large participation in the com-
merce of the East, the greater portion of which
is now enjoyed by Great Britain through her mail
steamship connections, via Suez, in the Indian
ocean and China seas.
The central position of the United States be-
tween eastern Asia and western Europe,affording
routes but little longer, if any, than those now
traversed between these distant regions, aided by
the superior expedition of railway transportation
