THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
cial pursuits, as they are not engaged in foreign
trade, they derive it indirectly. So, in this case,
the whole amount of money cannot be used in
purchasing seeds and plants; of course, large por-
tions of it must be used in paying the salaries of
the men who are employed. Unless you intend
to abolish the Department, I see no force in this
argument. The facts that have been adduced by
these Senators, if correctly applied, might be
urged in support of that proposition to increase
the appropriation. If it requires sixty-odd thou-
sand dollars to pay these salaries, and it is neces-
sary to purchase seeds and plants and rare arti-
cles of this kind to be distributed to agriculturists,
then the appropriation should certainly be more
than sixty thousand dollars. Unless you desire to
abolish the Department, and to dispense with the
distribution of seeds and plants, why limit the ap-
propriation to the bare salary of the incumbents?
But if Senators are opposed to the Depaitmcnt,
let them be consistent, and move to strike out the
whole appropriation. I have been proceeding on
the supposition that all were in favor of^sustain-
ing the Department and of continuing its exist-
ence, and of making an appropriation just large
enough to make it as effective as it can be made
under the circumstances by which we are sur-
rounded, taking into account, of course, the em-
barrassments under which the Treasury is now
laboring; that you desired to collect knowledge
as well as seeds and plants, and to advance agri-
culture by stimulating enlightened effort to pro-
vide a common receptacle for the preservation of
the result of all experiments, and thus secure a '
common i*eservoir from which ali may draw.
I willonly add,in conclusion, that in my opin-
ion the circumstances that surround us now re-
quire increased activity in this department. The
wants of the country have been increased. Here-
tofore when we were purchasing our sugar of the
sugar planters of Louisiana at four or five cents
a pound, there was less necessity for experiment-
ing with anew variety of sugar-cane than now.
We could at that time procure this great staple at
a very low rate; then you commenced experiments
with sorghum; now we are cut off by this war
from the old source of supply, we have to rely
almost exclusively on a foreign product; the ne-
cessity of bringing to perfection the experiments
hitherto commenced in connection with the culti-
vation of a new variety of sugar-cane has been
consequently greatly increased; the supply has
been diminished and the demand has been rela-
tively augmented. And so in relation to other ar-
ticles; flax, for example. Heretofore cotton could
be procured at nine cents a pound. Now 1 un-
derstand it is selling in the market at from fifty
to sixty cents a pound, and but a very limited
supply can be procuied at that price.
Mr. ANTHONY. Eighty cents.
Mr. HARLAN. Eighty cents, I am informed.
Ifa substitute can be procured for cotton, there
is now a pressing necessity for bringing it into
use. Theie is therefore an increased necessity
for an enlarged appropriation to enable this De-
partment to carry on these experiments if they
ought to be carried on at all. If they ought not
to be stimulated and encouraged by the Govern-
ment, we should abolish the Department at once
and have an end of it. If the amount proposed
by the committee will barely pay the salaries of
the Commissioner and the necessary officers under
his control, and the distribution of rare seeds, &c.,
is desirable, then let Senators be consistent anj^
increase the appropriation. If they oppose the
increase, howevei, on general grounds, because |
they are opposed to the Department, let them be j
candid, and move to abolish it. If it is to be con-
tinued, wisdom requires that it should be njade
effective.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. The State I represent
is new and exclusively agricultural. I ofcourse feel
a very deep interest in the adoption of the amend-
ment proposed by the Senator from Iowa. There
is quite a furor among our farmers in favor of the
Agricultural Department at Washington city.
They expect a great deal from it. I listened on
Saturday to the speech of the Senator from Min-
nesota, [Mr. Rice,] preferring charges against the
Agricultural Department here, but I submit to him
whether a single one of the charges that he made
can in truth be laid at the door of the present or-
ganization. Thechargesareagainstthe old regimty
and each one of them affords an argument in favor
of the present Department. So far as I have seen,
the Agricultural Department is discharging its
dutyfaithfully, beyond my most sanguine expect-
ations, although I voted for the bill establishing
it. We are engaged in Kansas now in endeavor-
ing to make thatState a cotton-growing free State.
We have wrenched it from the iron heel of sla-
very, and our people are ambitious to prove that
this commodity, heretofore grown exclusively by
slave labor, can more successfully and more prof-
itably be raised by free labor. My colleague and
myself are cooperating with the Agricultural De-
partment in accomplishing that object by distrib-
uting seeds for that purpose. I am opposed to
the attempt to retrench in this small way against
the agricultural interest of the country, and regret
that it comes from our side of the Chamber. I
can show the Senator from Maine where he can
retrench to the full amount of this appropriation;
in a way, too, to benefit Ins country. Let us stop
the pay, or dircct the President of the United
States to stop the pay of the supernumerary mili-
tary officers, who are a nuisance to the country,
and many of whom are at home electioneering
against their country. We can in that way, by
the passage of the bill which I propose to intro-
duce to-morrow, save this entire sum of ยง130,000
and greatly benefit the Government.
Mr. WILKINSON. The Senator from Kan-
sas asked whether certain statements that were
made here the other day by my colleague were ap-
plied to the present managers of the Agricultural
Department. I will state that last fall, five or six
months since, some ten or fifteen little sacks of
wheat, that would hold perhaps two or three
quarts each, were sent to me from the Agricultu-
ral Department, and I called the best farmers that
I knew in my part of the country into my office
to distribute the wheat to them; and upon cutting
off a little comer of the sack and pushing the
wheat out, I found that more than half of it was
being eaten upjjy the weevil or some other insect.
I was not conversant enough with the different
insects that destroy wheat to tell precisely what
if was; but I know that over one half of the sacks
of wheat which 1 received from this Agricultural
Department under the present manager of itweie
being destroyed by some insect which was veiy
destructive to the wheat, and I supposed it to be
the weevil. I, of course, burnt the wheat up.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. Will the Senator from
Minnesota permit me to ask him a question? Was
notthat wheat purchased by the predecessor of the
present incumbent? Was it not on hand when
the present incumbent came into office5
Mr. WILKINSON. 1 cannot answer the ques-
tion of the Senator from Kansas, but I suppose
that a man who is in charge of this Depaitnient
ought certainly to know what he is sending out to
the farmers of this country. I do not know who
bought the wheat; I do not know where it came
from; but I am ceitain that it was sent from this
Department under its piesent management.
Mr. DAVIS. I suppose.that evrry gentleman
who knows anything about wheat and farming,
knows that the weevil exists in the wheat in an
undeveloped state at times, when no man could
tell whether it was infested with weevil or not.
Every man knows that who knows anything
about wheat; and he knows another thing too,
that the way to develop wee\ il in wheat is to put
it m a warm position. Wheat that is put in sucks
or bags, or places where it will heat, will often
develop weevil, when if it were spread out where
the air would strike it freely and keep it cool, it
would never develop weevil at all. It is no re-
flection on anybody that wheat was sent off which
afterwards developed the weevil.
Mr. GRIMES. Does the Senator say that it
wan not the duty of the Commissioner of Agri-
culture to ascertain whether this wheat had weevil
in it before he sent it out?
Mr, DAVIS. How could he ascertain it?
Mr. GRIMES. By putting it in the very con-
dition tlie Senator speaks of; by putting it in that
warm condition when weevil would be developed,
if it existed there.
Mr. DAVIS. I say it was not his business,
because he had no reason to suspect that weevil
was there.
Mr. GRIMES. Then it was the business of
the Commissioner of Agriculture to disseminate
the weevil as well as the wheat!
Mr, DAVIS. Not fit all. The gentleman is
more acute than wise, as he often is. [Laugh-
ter.]
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. The objection ofte^i
urged against this Department is that the head of
it has not a classical education. Now, I want to
know from the Senator from Iowa ifa classically
educated Commissioner would be more likely to โข
discover weevil in wheat than a plain, practical,
common-sense farmer?
Mr. GRIMES. I have urged no such objection
as that against this Commissioner; X do not know
him; I never saw him; 1 do not know anything
about his qualifications. He may be the best clas-
sical scholar in the country, for aught I know. I
have notany interest in htm oranybody connected
with his Department. I am going to vote on this
question precisely as I think will best promote
the interests of the people that sent me here, and
without the slightest regard to any particular in-
dividual connected with the Agricultural Bureau.
Mr. HARLAN. Permit me to suggest to my
friend from Kansas that that argument would be
a more appropriate one upon the question of the
confumntion of the Commissioner of Agriculture,
if that were now pending before the Senate. As
that is not now the question, it seems to me we '
may come to a vote without any further argument
of such points.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. The question before
the Senate id peculiarly interesting to the people
thatl, in part, represent. As I stated, there is
quite a feeling in Kansas now on the subject ot
agriculture. We have recently reorganized our
State Agricultural Society. Its president is a na-
tive, 1 believe, of the State of Maine, who is one
of our supreme judges.
Mr. FESSENDEN. A fine fellow, I daresay.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. Yes; and well quali-
fied, a man of brains and integrity; and strange
as it may seem, he is really of opinion that the
Agricultural Department at Washington city is
of the utmost impoitance to the country, and he
is asking for cotton seed, for tobacco seed,and for
other seeds for the improvement of our State. I
hope as a politician, 1 hope for the benefit of the
State I represent, I hope for the benefit of the
great agricultural interests of this country, that
this appropriation of $130,000 will be made, as
has been proposed by the House of Representa-
tives.
Mr. President, 1 rose to say that I cannot un-
derstand the meaning of the Senator from Maine
when he says that he docs not seek to strike down
this Department. The Department say that they
want $67,000 to expend in the payment of the
employes of the Department. The Senator from
Maine proposes to cut down the appropriation for
the Department to $60,000. I should like to know
how much of that appropriation will be left to
furnish cottonseeds to the people of Kansas after
$07,000 is paid to the employes of the Department?
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Senator from Kansas
misapprehends the whole question. The paper
to which he has alluded, and which was read by
the Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Rice,] was a
paper showing how the Commissioner intended
to dispose of the money if he got the $130,000.
He does not spend $67,000 out of the ยง60,000 ap-
propriation in paying saiaricsat the present time,
because he has not got the men to pay the salaries
to. What he proposes is, that we raise the
appropriation to #130,000, and that out of that
$130,000 he will spend the $67,000. What I pro-
pose is, that the $60,000 shall remain as it is, and
that we dispense with these learned professors ot
the ologies and others that he proposes to employ,
and appropriate the same amount of money that
has been appropriated hitherto.
I did not propose, sir, to say anything more
about this question, and I shall say but a few
words now. What I protest against is, that the
Senator from Kansas or any other Senator should
complain that we desire to strike down this insti-
tution, when we propose to add $5,000 to what was
given last year. The Committee on Finance by
their amendment propose to increase the appro-
priation ยง5,000 beyond what it was last year, and
it was last year precisely the sum they wanted, and
was all that they said was necessary, and we were
told that they did not propose to ask for anything
more. We have gone even beyond that, and have
added $5,000 to that; but what the Senator is con-
tending for is, that we are striking down this in-
stitution because we will not appropriate more
