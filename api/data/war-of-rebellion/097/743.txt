Colonel W. W. McKIM,

Chief Quartermaster, Philadelphia:

Please report whether the strike and interruption of the working of coal mines in Schuylkill County will affect the supply or price of coal to the Government. The president of the Preston Coal Company has asked for military protection for those miners willing to work in that county. To furnish this protection it should appear that the Government has an interest in the continued working of the mines.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., April 13, 1865.(Received 7 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

Telegram received. The present strike of miners does not affect the supply or price of coal for the army. I learn that Preston Coal Company miners have resumed work, and do not think the interests of the Government require military interference at this time.

WM. W. McKIM,

Chief Quartermaster.
