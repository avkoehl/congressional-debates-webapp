The Tariff-
Qox.
Ho. of Reps.
1820, they were £41,484,461; from 1S21 to 1830 the an-
nual average fell to £36,597,623. During the noxt
decennary period a series of important commercial
reforms were carried through Parliament by the late
Lord Sydenham. Duties affecting more than 700 arti-
cles of importation were modified, and the duty on
French wines was reduced to a level with that levied
on wines from other countries. The result was an
increased export trade, the average value of Brit-
ish produce and manufactures sent abroad during
that period being £45,244,257, the average of the last
5 years of the series being £53,997,893. The altera-
tion in the wine duties alone increased our exports
to Trance from £475,884, at-which they stood in 1830,
to £2,378,149 in 1840. It is a striking fact that the
annual average exports to European nations were
less during the 5 years ending 1836 by 20 per cent,
than they were during the 5 years following the term-
ination of the war. Such were tho results of a sys-
tem intended by its upholders to foster and promote
British manufactures.
"It is, however, utterly impossible to convoy by
mere statistics of our exports any adequate picturo
of the condition of the nation when Sir Robert Peel
took office in 1841. Every interest in the country
wa& alike depressed; in tho manufacturing districts
mills and workshops were closed, and property daily
depreciated in value; in the sea-ports shipping was
laid up useless in harbor; agricultural laborers were
eking out a miserable existence on starvation wages
and parochial relief; the reyenue was insufficient to
meet the national expenditure; tho country was
broughtto the verge of national and universal bank-
ruptcy.
" The condition of the operatives in every district
was most appalling, It was proved that in Bolton
300 families, consisting of 1,400 individuals, had a
total income of £130 per week, or deducting rents,
£105 lis., which was only equal to 15£d. per head per
week. Out of 3,200 houses 409 were empty, 1,000 were
tenanted by families having only 18oJ. per week to
live upon, and the remainder by families whose in-
comes were not more than 2s. or 2s. Od. per week. Of
these poor people 1,601 had only 500 beds among
them, 582 sleeping three in a bed, 185 live in a bed,
78 six in a bed, and 42 seven in a bed. In Stockport on e
out of every five houses was untenanted, and half
of those occupied were not paying rent. In Paisley
650 heads of families were out of employment and
1,200 looms were idle. In the district of Manchester
80,000 persons were living on 15d. each per week, and
thousands of work people wero wandering through
the streets in search of employment. By cutting off
our foreign trade the operators were deprived of
employment, and hence the home trade suffered
through their utter inability to purchase even the
commonest necessaries.
"This lamentable condition of affairs was not con-
fined to one district, but spread throughout the
kingdom, not among tho working classes only, but
among the middle and higher classes also. Bank-
ruptcy and insolvency were remarkably frequent.
The distress which deprived tradesmen of their cus-
tomers, at the same time increased their difficulties
by the high poor rates which it rendered indis-
pensable. It was estimated that half the mills at
Lancashire wereclosed.and that the fixed capital of
thatcountry had depreciated fully 50 per cent. More-
over, there were no signs of improvement, for dur-
ing the parliamentary recess the distress bccame
fearfully and extensively aggravated.
"Tho protective system which was supported with
the view of rendering this country independent of
foreign sources of supply, and thus.it was hoped,
fostering the growth of a home trade, had most
effectually destroyed that trade by reducing tho
entire population to beggary,destitution, and want.
The masses of the population were unable to pro-
cure food, and had consequently nothing to spend on
British manufactures."—Pages 10,12.
FAVORABLE EFFECTS RESULTING FROJf THE ADOPTION
OF FREE TRADE IN ENGLAND.
" A singularly instructive category of facts, how-
ever, bearing upon the policy of import duties, may
be here referred to; and they will be best described
in the words used by Mr. Gladstone in 1861: 'In the
adjustments connected with what may be called the
simplification of the customs tariff last year ccrtain
articles, particularly some limited branches of the
wood trade, were brought under a duty; and the
result is rather singular. I believe this small meas-
ure was a sound one, and was for the interests of com-
merce; but the result shows that the imposition of a
duty had a highly restrictive effect upon these par-
ticular commodities. The total value of the import-
ations of the articles (among which chiccory and
certain woods were the principal) in 1859-60 was
£2,806,000; but in 1860-61 it was no more than £ iOo.OuO,
being a decrease of £501,000, or 17? percent.''' x
* * * 44'The imports of those articles on
which the duties were left untouched last year
amounted in 1859-60 to £138,155,000. In 1860-61 the
value was nearly the same; it was £137,406,000.
Thus it appears that there was a trifling decrease,
which, because it is so small, we may overlook/"
* x * * 44 41 now come to tho articles on
which the duty was not removed, but reduced last
year. In 1859-60, before the reduction, the value of
the imports of those articles was $11,346,000; but in
1860-61, since the reduction, the value was £13,323,000,
showing an increase of £1,976,000, or 175- per cent.,
upon this class of commodities, while the rest of the
tradeof the country was stationary.'" + *
*44Next and last come the articles on which the
41st Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 18.
duties were repealed in 1860. The value of the im-
portations in 1859-60 was £15,735,000, while in 1860-61
it was £22,062,000, being an increase of £6,327,000. or
no less than 40* por cent.'"
Upon this Noble proceeds to remark:
"A more perfect illustration of the effects of in-
direct taxation it is impossible to conceive. In pro-
portion as custom duties are augmented or reduced
so is tho trade of the country diminished or in-
creased; their entire removal, however, is clearly
shown to be productive of tho greatest advantage.
These striking facts give rise to most serious con-
siderations. If the full benefit of free-trade legisla-
tion is only secured by the entire repeal of duties
on imports it is clear that in the interest of the en-
tire community the abolition of the custom-house is
not merely highly desirable, but imperatively neces-
sary. If this bo the case, if the maximum of advan-
tage is not attainable by any other fiscal legislation,
tho means of its accomplishment, commonly tho
substitution of an equitable system of direct taxa-
tion, is an objcct eminently desorving tho attention
of the statesman, the economist, and the philan-
thropist.''—Pages 95, 96.
MORAL, PEACEFUL, AND MATERIAL INFLUENCES OP
FREE TRADE.
"The extension of free commercial intercourse
throughout Europe cannot fail to exercise a power-
ful influence on tho policy of Governments. "When
the interests ofmanufacturers, producers, and traders
become identical war will be less and less possible.
Extended intercourse will teach us to know and
respect oach other, and the identical interest that
an ever-increasing commerce will develop will
become a bond of peace and friendship throughout
tho world."—Page 143.
44 Happily for the peace and prosperity of tho coun-
try and for the progress of sound commercial legis-
lation throughout the world, the power of tho ob-
structives was insufficient to prevent tho develop-
ment of free-trade legislation. The results of tho first
cautious experiments demonstrated the wisdom of
the new financial policy. Its advantages are now
universally acknowledged. The revenue is collected
with greater ease, and to an amount far exceeding
the possibilities of tho restricted era. Agriculture,
manufactures, and trade have vastly increased in
prosperity. The laboringclasscs have received con-
stant employment at considerably higher wages.
The landed proprietors have benefited in the im-
proved value of their property. Disaffection has
beon banished, and all classes are now united in the
support of the institutions under which such an
unexampled prosperity has been secured."—Pages
