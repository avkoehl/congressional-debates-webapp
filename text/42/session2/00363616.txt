as well to strike out the whole appropriation.
1 move, therefore, to reconsider the vote by
which that amendment was agreed to. The
appropriation is only $8,000, and it is to enable
the Secretary to make one gnn and test it.
Mr. WR1G-HT. If this appropriation is
not sufficient,, let it be made large enougli to
accomplish the purpose. I am opposed in
principle to this thing of selecting out a par-
ticular gun and appropriating money to test
that to the exclusion of all other guns. I
think all guns ought to have an equal chance.
If this sum is not sufficient make it sufficient.
.Unless there be some good reason why this
particular gun should be selected from all
others and apply the test to that, then I insist
the amendment should stand as adopted.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion to reconsider.
The motion was not agreed to.
The amendments were ordered to be en-
grossed and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time, and passed.
