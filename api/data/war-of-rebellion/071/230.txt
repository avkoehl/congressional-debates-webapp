called upon in case of attack on any point of the line. Major-General McCook will see that the trench guards are distributed on his different fronts, according to their relative exposure and importance.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT STEVENS, July 12, 1864-12 p. m.

Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff:

Orders for dispositions of troops and commands on the line received. I do not deem it proper to make any changes to-night as the troops and pickets are posted, but it will be carried out first thing in the morning. Please say to the general I should like to see him at an early hour in the morning, and it would not be proper for me to leave the front. All quiet.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT STEVENS, July 12, 1864.

(Received 1 p. m.)

General AUGUR:

Captain Hotopp, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, reports the enemy has withdrawn his pickets on the Delphi Mill road and Davis road and appears to be falling back on the Rockville road. His impression is they are either going toward Georgetown or Rockville.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.

CRYSTAL SPRING, July 12, 1864-5. 10 p. m.

(Via Fort Stevens. Received 5. 24 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

I have suggested to General McCook the propriety of driving away a thin line of the enemy (not more than 500), who occupy a crest and house near our line and 1,100 yards only from Fort Stevens. The special object is to put them out of a large house occupied by sharpshooters. It will be done on relieving picket, and without trouble.

Very respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
