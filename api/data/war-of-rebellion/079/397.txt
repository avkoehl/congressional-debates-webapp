Captain DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: I have received General Sherman's communication of 11 p. m., October 21. In accordance with paragraph IV, Special Field Orders, Numbers 99, and verbal instructions from the general, the reconnaissance was made to King's Hill. Being a reconnaissance, the packs were left at camp on the river. The supply train and ammunition wagons are with those of the Army of the Cumberland. If it is desired that I should go to Gadsden or Will's Valley it will be necessary to bring up supplies required. Does the general wish me to push on to Gadsden to-day? If so, where will, the command cross the Coosa, should the army cross to the east side? The First Ohio, a small regiment, was with the train, and, being short of ammunition, was detailed for the courier-line. Order were sent to it. The messenger sent reported the regiment sent by some one to Rome as guard for a train. Another has been detailed.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.
