Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHATTANOOGA, February 18, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

I regret to be obliged to report that I do not think I shall be able to take the field, the cold and damp weather having brought on an attack of neuralgia, from which I suffer intensely.

I am getting troops prepared as rapidly as possible, and will send them out under General Palmer if you think it best.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, February 18, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

By all means send the expedition. I think it should move as soon as possible, for the effect it will have in favor of Sherman and also on affairs in East Tennessee. I regret that you cannot go.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

I can get along with what force I have, including Granger's corps, until General Thomas makes his move. I did not know one was contemplated when I suggested that he should send more troops.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
