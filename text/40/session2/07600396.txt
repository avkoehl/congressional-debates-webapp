THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 8,
may be stated thus: ia my notice to the con-
testant, my first and fourth charges, upon which
it will be seen he took issue with me in his an-
swer, are stated thus :
" 1. I charge that I received a majority of the Totes
that were legally east for a. Representative in Congress
at the said election, and that they should hare been
counted for me in the returns from the various town-
ships and oounties of the district instead of being
rejected (as they were) and omitted from my count
by the election judges and other returning offioers.
Of the legal ballots thus cast for me, but which were
not counted in my favor, about one hundred and
seventy were so cast by legal voters in the county of
Clinton; about one hundred in the county of Cald-
well; about two hundred in the county of Ray; about
the same number in the county of Carroll; probably
about one hundred in the county of Chariton; about
five hundred in the county of Saline, and probably
about an equal number in the counties, respectively,
of La Fayette, Jackson, Platte, and Clay; and the
votes thus cast for me, but rejected and not counted
in my favor, were so cast by loyal citizens, who had
duly complied with the test-oath provision of the
new constitution, but were denied the right of regis-
tration as qualified voters, their names registered as
rejected voters, and their ballots placed in the boxes
of rejected voters accordingly. I shall hence demand
such a comparison or inspection of the ballots thus
cast for me as may be sufficient to verify the allega-
tion thus made that you were not, and that I was,
elected to Congress from this district."
"4. Iohargethatin many townships and counties
you wore certified to have received more votes than
were really cast foryou, while aless numberthan those
cast for me were counted and certified in my favor;
that in some counties the poll-books of entire town-
ships which had given me majorities were illegally
excluded in the count and certificates of the county
clerks, who were your partisans; while in others the
poll-books of entire townships which had given you
majorities, but which were legally invalid, were in-
cluded in the count and certificates of clerks alike
partisan and unjust; and I shall consequently insist
upon a recount of all the ballot^cast at said elec-
tion."
This notice was duly served upon the sitting
member on the 10th day of January, 1867.
On the 5th of February following, which was
the first day afterward that a court'was held
at which I could "demand such a compari-
son or inspection of the ballots" as I had !
notified him I would demand, I did so demand
it, and it was refused to me by a court, the
judges of whom claimed to have been elected
on the same ticket with the sitting member.
If it would at all strengthen the argument on
this point, it might be additionally stated that
the partisan county attorney, who subsequently
appeared as the contestee's counsel in the
taking of these depositions, was even officiously
prominent in pointing out the law upon which
this gross misruling was predicated; but it will
suffice to state that as this was the ruling of a
court in the preliminary or foundation stage
of our suit or controversy, he at least accepted
that ruling, so far as it forced upon me the
class of testimony t  which I was thencefor-
ward compelled to resort at his own peril; and
that it would be to reverse every principle of
either law or justice to permit him thus and
here to "take advantage" of his own mis-
judgment or "of his own wrong." If this be
not so, or if, in other words, what I can but
regard as a more rigid ruling of the commit-
tee than it would make upon still further
reflection upon the record, • is nevertheless
indorsed as the judgment of the House, I can
but naturally suppose it to carry with it a vir-
tual decision of all future election contests in
favor of the party who (for the time being)
may have the ear of the coumty tribunals, who
hold the key to the county records 1
The House will of course bear with me in
the attempt to render this illustration still
more practically apposite and persuasive as to
its duty in this case. As it was shown by the
returns which were canvassed and sent to the
secretary of State that the contestee had a
majority against me of 534, I would of course
have had to prove, under the committee's
ruling, in order to entitle myself to the seat in
controversy, that at least 535 votes which were
not counted and returned for me ought to have
been so counted and so returned. Well, sir, it
is shown by the testimony that I essayed nay
utmost to do this, and I feel that I hazard noth-
ing in saying I would have done so but for the
misrulings of the court, which were practically
finalasi to the "class" of testimony to which!
was driven in further carrying on this contest.
To the number of 133 "rejected" votes, and as
I had reason to believe to a much larger number
of "accepted" votes, the records of the elec-
tion were absolutely sealed against me; and
when to this it is added, that from this illegal
and doubtless preconcerted refusal of the offi-
I cial supporters of the contestee, to permit me
to exemplify or prove from the ballots of the
townships where these rejected votes were
divided between him and myself the " names"
of those who voted for me, as contradistin-
guished from the name or names of those who
voted for him, is it not too plain for argument
that the contestee himself is responsible for
'' the class of evidence'' to which I was most
reluctantly driven in the preparation, present-
ation, and final submission of this case?
Will you, nevertheless, permit him to object
against me now, that his judges and clerks
refused me justice then ? or will you not the
rather concede to me, that as I had no rea-
son to anticipate that the judicial misrulings
and other official impediments which had been
cast in my way thus early in my own county
would be in any sense modified to my advan-
tage in a majority of the remaining counties, I
should be at least excused for having so com-
promised my way, through judges and clerks
who were "dead against me," as to make sure
of what I had reason to suppose would be tes-
timony enough "to at least vacate the elec-
tion?"
I knew, Mr. Speaker, what I may allude to
without even an implication of political or
official disparagement, that my mere political
status was not such as to commend me to
consideration beyond "the testimony and the
law," but I recurred to what I was once a
party to before the same committee, and to
what I shall here recall and copy from their
ruling in the three Missouri cases which were
presented for their consideration four years
ago, and which, in their report upon the case
of Bruce vs. Loan, is set out in these equit-
able, direct, and unambiguous words:
"The contestee, on the hearing, took exceptions
to some of the allegations contained in the contest-
ant's notice as indefinite, and referred to failures on
the part of the contestant to comply with some "of
the provisions of the act passed in 1851 relative to
taking testimony in contested-election cases.
"The majority of the committee, from the view
they entertain of this case, deem it unnecessary to
discuss in their report the questions presented by the
contestee's exceptions, as they are entirely satisfied,
from the testimony produced, where both parties
appeared and the witnesses were subjected to a rigid
cross-examination by the contestee, that the election
was not conducted so as to entitle either o&ndicfeate
to a seat in this House."
I remembered this perfectly, Mr. Speaker.
It may be respectfully repeated that I remem-
bered it analogously, discriminatingly, and
personally; and that although in that case, and
in the analogous ones, to one. of which I was
myself the party contestant, the minority of
the committee took a somewhat different view
both as to the '' class'' and the sufficiency of
the testimony, there was neither of us who re-
garded the loss of our cases by the subsequent
non-concurrence of the House as having re-
sulted from the character or the '1 class'' of our
testimony. In my own case I had testimony
from but four counties out of ten, and even that
was rebutted and "explained away" by many
well-considered depositions on the part of the
contestee; whereas in the present case I have
the same "class of evidence" (as to the extent
of the disfranchisements which were complained
of alike in each case) from eight of the ten coun-
ties of the same district, and without even so
much as a line to break the force of so exuber-
ant an abundance. If, therefore, I have suc-
ceeded in satisfying the dignity of the House
that I did not disregard what I had reason to
regard as its most apposite precedents, but
rather clung to them in the extremity to which
I deemed myself reduced by the misrulings and
other wrongs of the official partisans of the
contestee, and have also satisfied its consci-
entious judgment that I have at least proven
enough to "vacate" this election, I shall but
naturally expect that the resolution which
declares the contestee entitled to represent our
district will be superseded by one which shall
reprobate the registration and election as hav-
ing been alike illegal and unfair, and as a con-
sequence to vacate the seat in controversy.
A few words more, Mr. Speaker, and from
the technical question of "evidence" which
we have been so long considering we will pass
to the broader and less technical guarantees of
the Federal Constitution—to the "bill of rights
for the people of each State," as a former Chief
Justice of the United States denominated those
guarantees, and which I hope to demonstrate
are all-embracing as to the more enlarged con-
stitutional aspect of this case. In a subor-
dinate^ conservative view of the question it
might perhaps be best were it as true in fact
as it doubtless appeared to the official under-
standing of the committee, that "by every
department of the State government of Mis-
souri" its new " constitution is regarded and
acted upon as the fundamental law of the
State." As, however, of the official bulletin
once announced to the nations, in the face
of sorrowing history, that "order reigned in
Warsaw," so, too, of whatever has been of
recognition for this new constitution by the
people of a State so fair and fertile as to con-
tinue to prosper even under the worst misgov-
ernment—it has been but "the order of the
despot and the slave." That constitution, sir,
was never so '' recognized and acted upon'' by
the judicial department of our State govern-
ment so long as we had a constitutional judi-
ciary ; but it was, on the contrary, the crown-
ing blemish of the dishonoring official history
of that instrument, that our supreme judges,
who had been elected by the same constitu-
ency which had limited the convention not to
do what they did do, were dragged from the
; bench to the calaboose in obeisance to the
usurping sword of a partisan executive, and
that the same sword thrust into their places, in
defiance alike of protest and of law, a new
bench of so-called judges, through' whom alone
it came to pass that such a constitution was
even "seemingly" recognized by the State
judiciary, and that only to be thrown back upon
them by the supreme Federal judiciary. When,
to this it is added that perhaps nine tenths of
the revenue of the State is paid by citizens
who realize that the Government which col-
lects it exists alone in "fraud, and force, and
acquiescence," and that there is reserved to
the House I am addressing, "in the reception
of Representatives from that State," the
"right to judge of the qualifications and re-
turns" of those Representatives, there will
have been laid at least a sufficient premise for
the paragraphs which it is but fair to next
quote from the report of the committee, as
follows:
" The contestant now claims that this State consti-
tution, so far at least as it affects elections of mem-
bers of Congress, should be held a nullity, and a3 if
it had never been qflopted bythe people of the State.
" This is claimed upon the ground that the conven-
tion by whom it was framed exceeded their powers
given by the legislative act by which the convention
was called, and that this was not cured by its subse-
quent adoption bythe people, because, in submitting
it to a vote of the people, those only were allowed to
vote who could take the oath prescribed in the second
article of the constitution, the effect of which was to
preclude large numbers from voting who had been
previously allowed to vote. The committee have
not deemed themselves at liberty to enter upon this
inquiry.
' It being conceded that by every department of
the State government of Missouri this constitution is
recognized and acted upon as the fundamental law
of the State, and by Congress in the reception of
representatives from the State, it is in our judgment
too late for this House to inquire as to the regularity
of its formation or adoption by the State."
To what extent these positions have been
anticipated and theoretically replied to, in the
previous argument as to the proper construc-
tion of the clause of the constitution here in
controversy, remains, of course, to be denoted
in the final judgment of the House; and I
hence here conclude or close that branch of
the argument to which you have so indulgently
listened.
Coming, lastly, to that portion of the report
of the committee which has relation to the
decision of the Supreme Court, in disaffirmance
