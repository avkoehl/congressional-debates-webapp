A PRE LMPTION BIT I
An act for the rel ef of certain tattlers on the public lanus
who a^e deprived ofthe bench sof the pie empti n a t of the
19th June iQ34 Phis bill, having a me duvwi Irom the tíi
nate had he i amen led by the Committee of tht Whol and
the first questnn wis upon that amendment, which was con
cuned m
Mr ril^PMlN^aid il<itha\mgrepoited the bill as a mem
ber ofthe Committee on Public Lands, and being called on by
■BW 
some gentlemen now to explain its provisions, he would do so,
thougn very briefly, as it was not his intention, at that late pe 
nod of the session, unnecessarily to consume the time of the
House
He said that the class of individuals for whose relief the
bill was intended, was, perhaj f?, the most mentorious of all
those who are embraced under the provisions of tho pre emp
tion law of 1834 They weie entitled, under that act, to pre-
emptions, had settled in the Creek and Choctaw nations after
the late treaties with those tribes, íesided upon the land they
had improved at the passage ofthe act, and cultivated, as re
quired in 1833 By the tieaties with those tribes, it is pro
vidf d that certain Indians should be allowed reservations, to be
located by agents appointed for that purpose subsequently
Those, he said, were floa mg rights, until located in the manner
piescnbed by the tieaties in many cases, they were, by autho
nzed agents, placed uj on certain lands and ¡.orne time after
wards taken uji andie located upon otheis In chai ging those
locations great injury had been done to the most industrious of
the settiei4' ioi the mam object in taking up #ie first, and
making the second location*, was not so much on account of
getting bettei land, as to secure more valuable improvements
Thus the most industrious and thrifty among the settlers, those
who had made the best and most extensive improvements were
the victims to those last locations After they had a vested right
to entei the lands they had improved, undei the act of 1834, and
when they felt perfectly secuie from all interruption by those
floating reservations, knowing they had been already located,
then lands were taken by the agent of the Government, and
given to the Indians by those sub equent locations Mr C
said that he knew man ofthe n ost respectable and industrious
citizens inius district, who had been lumed bv that proceeding
They had been suddenly and unnecessarily driven from their
hornet by thepuichaser of those reservations from the Indian?,
and their families turned out, at an unseasonable time af the
year under circumstances of great cruelty
Mi C said it was a question whether the se'tleiP, whose
pre eruptions were taken by he subs quent locations had not
the better title But so it wis they had not contested the
rights of Indians to whom then lands had been assisted, but
had appealed to Congi e   to doth m, as tar as circumstances
would permit, that justice Uey had been deprived of under the
act ol 1834 They could not ha i em^tated m all the rights they
had lost, if ihe bill passed as repot ed Mi C said the bill un
der consideration provided that each individual, entitled to en
ter land under the pre emption law of!834, and had been de
pri ved of that right "s before stated, should be permitted to
en'cr eaca a quarter section of any other land in the same land
district, not settled upon by any othei person, and had not been
oifered at public sale, by paying Government price, or, at his
op ion, to enter the same quantity of land, subject to pi i vate en
tr>   by paying the fees of office only
Mr C said that, in the ceunuy wheie the persons coming
within the act rLSided, there weie no valuable lands that could
be found that had not already been staled upon, and the best
land unimproved would be bntpoor compensation for the loas
of then impiov t ments He said that the lands «ubject to pri
vale cntiy had been so long in market that few selections could
be made sufii icntly fertile foi cultivation Mr C «aid that,
as the relief provided by the bill, although fai shoitof the lo*a
i hey had sustained, was the best that could be done under the
circumstance* he was willing to accept that, and he hoped the
House would n t hesitate to grant it
