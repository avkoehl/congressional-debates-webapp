the gentleman would please recollect that the note hotiets

notes at par m payment of debts due them, was, he though , a
presumption m their favor
Mr PROFriT observed that the least that was said about
the depreciated notes of these b inks the better It was i ot

Ml DA W-vON ol Georgia observed that the depi edition of

is to be allowe 1 to hose Individ ials who had commuted such,
he would not say iiauds but tricks upon the community, which
would disgrace an mdniduil in his private charactei
He was not unfrendly to the granting of bar k charléis to
the citizens of this District, whilst they wese used m the id
joining States but he thought, in lead of lcnewin  these old
charters, made twenty five oi Unity yeais a" and not moj ei

Mr J said, he objected to the passage of this hill, because,
for the want of proper restrictions and guards, he ronsidel
the charters, as proposed even worse than the old ones Bv
this bill they weie to pay their 0W7i paper on dem° d in gold

would do but little e\oept Hading m depiet lated paper Thi-e
banks are to ¡s-ue no bills under five doll irs on the lace ofthe
bill, but the resti iction put m by the Senate, that they should
issuenoblll between five md ten and tenant! twen y dollars,
was now stricken out, which was equivalent, in his opinion to
issuing one, two and three dollal notes He would prefer that
She bill should directly give the power of issumg.shjnptesters,
that the country might see who weie for, and who against, the
issuing of small paper

Mr. WOODBURY observed lhat, as this was a
resolution looking merely to inquiry, he should not
detain the Senate by any remarks, unless the pas-
sag" of the resolution wat, opposed.
Mr MERRICK objected to the resolution. He
eon) i see no propi e'y in imposing this dotty oa the
Committee on the PMr.ct He denied that ibe
S^na " had a right to m'erfrie with the people of
the Ihnrií-t, «hither they choie to bury the Bank
bill or to rejoice at lhe veto.
Mr. WOODBURY vsaid the resolution proposed
that .he ir.quny be made by the Committee on the
Dt>tnct of Columbia, f< r \ery manifest reasons.
The evil complained of was a violent interruption
o  iheqmu of some of th branches ofthe Go-
vernment, in hj discnarge of their public duties is
this; Dust.ic , set apart and consecrated to that
ohjpot
Iht co nm.'tee has the eeneral supervision

mist roateini, lhe m""t vital of them, to the whole
country, ds we 1 a* to the permanent inhabitants of
t'e ten müe$ tqume leseived for this great ob-
ject, is the tfiiquil and undi-ouibed performance
of it
O hervJise it will be seen that lhe continuance of
Ce.r st«iion> Ki ihis city b^c^mes endangered, and
the representatives of the people and Stales, if un-
it Ic to !tgi 'ate wit' out violent UiOlestation, being
but hree oi four hundred among thousands, must
rf turn to tonr cci.slitu*n s, or proteci themselves
