Of these all were serviceable, and about four-fifths were field guns of recent and approved pattern.

If to the operations of your armies, the legitimate fruits of which they really are, be credited the guns captured at Charleston and Wilmington (excluding from the number of the latter those capture at Fort Fisher and the other forts at the mouth of Cape Fear River), the total artillery captured during the past ten months by troops under your immediate command will exceed 700 guns.

Throughout the campaign the ammunition, fuses, and prismers proved unusually good and reliable, the only fault observed being sand cracks and insufficient bursting charges in a few of the 20-pounder Parrott projectiles, want of care in the screwing of the Bormann fuse in 12-pounder projectiles, and insufficient bursting charges in many of the Hotchkiss 3-inch shell and case-shot. Ammunition and fuses received from Saint Louis Arsenal appear to be more complained of (especially the fuses) than that received from other places.

In conclusion I am gratified to be able to commend the offices and men for attention to their duties in preparation for the field, and for good conduct after entering it; for the details of which I respectfully invite attention to the sub-reports which will be laid before you.

The services of the following-named officers give evidence of industry, intelligence, and gallant conduct, and entitle them to notice and reward, namely:

Major Osborn, First New York Artillery, chief of artillery Army of the Tennessee; Major Reynolds, First New York Artillery, chief of artillery Twentieth Army Corps; Major Waterhouse, First Illinois Artillery, chief of artillery Seventeenth Army Corps; Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, First Michigan Artillery, chief of artillery Fifteenth Army Corps; Major Houghtaling, First Illinois Artillery, chief of artillery Fourteenth Army Corps. I respectfully ask that each of these officers, who have also served faithfully and creditably through the Atlanta and Savannah campaigns, be recommended for promotion by brevet.
