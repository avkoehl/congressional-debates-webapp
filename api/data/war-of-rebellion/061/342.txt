with our wounded, which we brought with us, I was compelled to leave the caissons, though I at the time supposed we were to bring them off in the morning. Having moved back to the open field, we joined the other regiments of the brigade, and, after obtaining a supply of ammunition, moved out with the brigade about a mile upon the road over which we had driven the rebels, and there formed line of battle and remained during the night. At this time the Fifty-eighth Illinois Regiment was detached and moved to their original position behind their fortifications upon the left of the open field. The Ninth Indiana Battery, at the beginning of the engagement, although in the finest position on the field, was completely masked by the battery (L, First U. S. Artillery), consequently could not be used till late in the engagement, at which time it made some very fine shots, dismounting one of the enemy's guns, and totally silencing the remaining guns of the battery. The officers and men of the First Brigade have fully indicated their great superiority over the rebel hosts to which they were opposed in the battle of Pleasant Hill. Feeling satisfied that if my brigade had been together greater would have been the results, I still feel a pride in knowing that to the First Brigade, Third Division, Sixteenth Army Corps, belongs the credit of giving the enemy the first check, of turning his flank, of driving him farther, and of holding longer the grounds captured than any troops on the field.

To Lieutenant George Sawin, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant William Wallis, acting assistant inspector-general, and Lieutenant S. D. Sawyer, acting aide-de-camp, members of my personal staff, I am deeply indebted for their coolness, bravery, and efficiency. I would especially recommend to your favorable notice the following-named officers of the Fifty-eighth Illinois: Major Thomas Newlan, commanding; Captain Robert W. Healy, acting field officer, and Lieutenant J. O'Kane, acting adjutant. The line officers of this regiment are all worthy of especial mention; want of space alone prevents it. I must mention the extraordinary daring, coolness, and bravery of the two color-bearers, Sergt. Fred. Menk and Corpl. O. A. Teeple. Of the Eighty-ninth Indiana, Colonel C. D. Murray, commanding the regiment; Lieutenant Colonel Hervey Craven, and Major Samuel Henry, also all the line officers, every one behaved gallantly. Of the One hundred and nineteenth Illinois, Colonel Thomas J. Kinney, commanding the regiment, Major W. H. Watson, and all the line officers, deserve great credit. Captain George R. Brown, of the Ninth Indiana Battery, has proved himself a capable, cool, and gallant officer. Captain John Tobin, Company K, Fifty-eighth Illinois, fell shot through the heart while gallantly leading his men in the charge. Captain F. S. Zeek, Company C, Eighty-ninth Indiana, fell severely wounded in both feet while bravery leading his company across the field. In this connection I would respectfully state that quite a number of the One hundred and seventy-eighth New York, with their colors, were with men on the 3-mile charge through the woods, and acquitted themselves with honor. Below I give you a list of casualties* in the First Brigade.

Again thanking the brave officers and men whom I have the honor to command, I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. F. LYNCH,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain J. B. SAMPLE,

Asst. Adjt. General, First and Third Divs., 16th A. C.
