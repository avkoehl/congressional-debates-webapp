MOWING AND REAPING MACHINES.
Mr. SEWARD presented the memorial of
Howard & Co., against the renewal of the patents
of Cyrus H. McCormick and Obed Hussey, for
impiovements in reaping machines; which was
ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. SEWARD. I am instructed to present
to the Senate concurrent resolutions of the Legis-
lature of the State of New York in relation to the
extension of .patents; which I ask may be read
and laid upon the table.
The resolutions were read. They declare that
in the judgment of the Legislature the sentiment
of the people of that State is opposed to the pas-
sage of any law by Congress extending the time
of any patent or patents heretofore granted to
Cyrus H McCormick, Obed Hussey, or Moore &
Hascall, or to either or any of them, for mowing
or reaping machines.
Mr. STUART. If the Senator will allow me,
I wish, before the question is taken on ordering
those resolutions to lie on the table, to say a few
words. As a representative of the State in which
one of the individuals mentioned in the resolution
resides, I wish to interpose my protest against
his being brought into that sort of company. 1
have had some opportunity, heretofore, to discuss
his claims in opposition to the claims of others;
but my principal object now is to apprise the
j Senate that this is but the commencement of a
scheme, concocted by individuals who oppose the
extension of these patents, to perambulate the en-
tire Union, and to get resolutions of instructions
passed in every State in which they can get them.
I only want to apprise the Senate that that is the
plan, and that it is as unmeaning as it would be if
we were to sit here and listen to the blowing of the
wind, because you may go to the Legislature of
any State in this Union, where these patentees do
not themselves reside, and get such resolutions of
instruction. They mean nothing. The plan has
been gotten up in this city; it has been concocted
since the commencement of the present session of
Congress; and it has sought to bring to bear a
supposed public opinioi; indiscriminately against
these men. Now, sir, 1 submit that the opinion
of no Senator upon any such topic as that should
be influenced in the least by such proceeding's.
The Legislatures have no examination of the
questions connected with the applications for the
extension of the patents; the facts are not before
them, they have no cognizance of the matter at
all; they cannot discriminate between those who
are meritorious and those who are not. This is
the work merely of an agent of certain manufac-
turers, who desire to add to their wealth out ofthe
inventive genius of deserving men. 1 only wish
to apprise the Senate, and, perhaps, the country,
ofthe sort of machinery that is set in motion.
The resolutions were ordered to lie upon the
table.
