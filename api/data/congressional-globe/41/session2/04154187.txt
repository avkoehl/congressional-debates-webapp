THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Thus, while Ohio has a million and a half
more inhabitants than Massachusetts, Massa-
chusetts has nearly thirty-nine million dollars
more of bank currency than Ohio. Yet Ohio
pays nearly seven million dollars more internal
revenue tax than Massachusetts. Illinois has
within a small fraction two millions-more in-
habitants than Connecticut; but Connecticut
has $7,500,000 more bank currency than Illi-
nois. Yet Illinois pays $10,700,000 more
internal revenue tax than Connecticut. Mis-
souri has about six times the population of
Rhode_ Island; but Rhode Island has about
three times more bank currency than Missouri.
Yet Missouri pays $4,000,000 more internal
taxes than Rhode Island. Indiana has one
million and a quarter more population than
Connecticut, butConnecticuthasnearlysix mil-
lion and a half times more bank currency than
Indiana; yet Indiana pays $1,500,000 more
internal revenue tax than Connecticut. Mas-
sachusetts has thirty-eight dollars, Connecti-
cut thirty-two dollars, and Rhode Island fifty-
eight dollars for each person in the State,
while Louisiana has one dollar, Georgia one
dollar, Alabama twenty-four cents, and Missis-
sippi five cents per head! And yet it is cotton
which is to restore the balance of trade in our
favor.
Why is it, Mr. Speaker, that so large a num-
ber of the seats in this House have been empty
during this entire debate? There is a general
paralysis of trade throughout the western and
southern States, and a cry for relief comes to
us from every quarter of the country. But
regardless of the prostration of business, serene
in the knowledge that banker and bondholder
are fattening on the misfortunes of the people,
the Representatives of the monopolists with-
draw from their seats and refuse to aid, even
by their presence, in giving that relief which
tiie people so earnestly demand.
Sir, what is the cause of this distress which
pervades the land? Why this paralysis of
trade? Why is it that petitions for relief have
poured in upon us by hundreds? It is, sir,
because the legislation of Congress for years
past and is now solely in the interest of the
banker and bondholder.
in I860, within one year after the close of
the war, at the very moment there was a
demand for currency for the ten States of the
South once more restored to commercial rela-
tions with us—at that very moment Congress
and the Administration began to reduce the
volume of currency. And all this, sir, has
been done in the interest of banker and bond-
holder, and to the injuiy of the people. Why ?
Because scarcity of currency makes high inter-
est and high rents, with low wages for the
workman and low1 prices for the farmer. Nor
does the evil stop there. The merchant depends
oil the custom of the farmer and the mechanic,
and if the price of the products of the one
find the labor of the other are reduced their
purchases must be reduced also ; the family
does with less; the goods ^of the merchant
lie upon the shelves unsought; notes become
due without money to meet them, aud distress
follows.
The table I hold in my hand illustrates the
effect of this contraction. I addressed a note
to the Commissioner of Agriculture for certain
information. In reply he furnished this table,
showing the average price per bushel of wheat
in the States of New York, Ohio, Illinois, and
the United States generally, during the years
1S0G, 18U7, 1863, and 1800. I find that in the
State of New York in 18GG wheat was worth
$2 07 per bushel; in 1867, $2 64; in 1808
$2 08 ; and in 1809, $1 37. In Ohio in 1866
a bushel of wheat was worth $2 o2; in 1807,
S2 86; in 1868, $1 65; and in 1800, &1 03.
Jn Illinois a bushel of wheat 111 1806 was worth
$1 93; in 1867, $1 97; in 1868, $1 20; and in
I860, seventy-six cents. So that one bushel ot
wheat in New York in I860 paid $2 67, while
ill 1869 it only paid $1 37 of taxes. That in
Ohio, in 1866, one bushel of wheat paid $2 ,)2
of taxes, and in 1869 only $1 03 of taxes.
That in Illinois, in 1866, one bushel of wheat
paid $1 98, and in 1869 only seventy-six
cents of taxes. Hence, that in consequence
of the contraction which has gone on during
the last four years the farmers of New York
have lost on their wheat $1 30 a bushel, the
farmers of Ohio $1 49 a bushel, the farmers
of Illinois $1 17 a bushel. And, as the farmer
pays his taxes with his wheat and other pro-
duets of the soil, through the agency of his labor,
and as it required more than twice the amount
of wheat to pay his taxes in 18G9 that was
required in 18G6, it follows that in the interval
of time between those years taxes upon the
farmers have been practically doubled.
Now, sir, there is a fact connected with this
question of the currency which appears to be
entirely overlooked. It is as to the relation
between the volume of taxes and the volume
of currency. And to the investigation of this
subject I have given labor and study,
In 1860 the total taxes paid by the people
of the United States for Federal, State, and
local purposes amounted to $150,200,000; the
total currency of the country at that time was
$457,000,000; and the proportion of taxes to
currency was thirty-three per cent., while in
1809 the proportion of taxes to currency was
one hundred per cent. In that year the aggre-
gate taxes amounted to $090,900,000, while the
currency was only $089,000,000 ; so that if
all the taxes—local, State, and Federal—had
been paid upon one day there would not have
been currency enough in the country to have
paid them ; and it may be safely calculated
that at all times there is at least $200,000,000
withdrawn from circulation and loeked up in
the hands of the tax-gatherer. The taxes of
the country in 18G9 exceeded the currency of
the country by $1,900,000, while in 1860 the
amount ol' currency exceeded the amount of
taxes by $306,800,000.
I maintain, sir, that the only true limit to
the volume of currency is the demand, the
necessity for its use.
In 1860 one third of the currency of the coun-
try paid all the taxes of the country; while
to-day the entire currency of the country is not
sufficient to pay the taxes of the country if
they were all collected on one day. 1 hold that
if 1 stood without any other argument than this
it is conclusive as to the necessity of a greater
volume of currency for the business wants
of the people. You eastern gentlemen, who
represent the great cities of New York and
Boston and Philadelphia, do not seem to under-
stand how, when there is a glut of money in
your cities, it can be that in Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, or any other western or southern State,
there is a scarcity of money, and the people
are paying from fifteen to tweuty per cent, per
annum for its use.
I met but a day or two since a citizen of
Indiana, who I believe is known to the entire
delegation of that State on this floor, and he
told me that one of the banks of that State paid
him ten per cent, on his deposits. Now, if a
bank can pay ten per cent, on its deposits, how
much do you suppose it charges the man who
is compelled to borrow at its counter?
Sir, the remedy against this great wrong lies
with the men who represent on this tloor the
people of the South and West. They must
learn a lesson from the representatives of the
bankers and bondholders of the Bast; they
must combine without regard to party m assert-
ing and maintaining the rights and interests
of their constituents; and if they do so com-
bine they will triumph.
And, now, for a few moments I wish to call
your attention to the bill reported by my hon-
orable friend and colleague, [Mr. GaufieldJ
to whose courtesy I am indebted for an oppor-
tunity to participate at this time in the debate
upon his bill.
My honorable colleague coolly told us this
morning that a resolution had been passed by
the House requiring the Committee on Bank-
ing and Currency to report a bill to increase
the currency of the country to the extent of
$50,000,000. I think I do not misrepresent
my honorable friend.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. " Circulating
currency " was the term used in the resolution.
Mr. ^ MORGAN. Granted. What has the
committee done? Instead of introducing a
bill to increase " the circulating currency" as
directed—not as requested, but as directed by
a solemn resolution of this House—the com-
mittee has introduced a bill which, instead of
increasing the circulation $50,000,000, actually
decreases ,it $9,000,000. How is that done?
It is not pretended by the chairman of the
Committee on Banking and Currency that the
requirements of the House have been complied
with, bnt he told the House in his opening
argument the provisions of the bill increased
the volume of the currency $13,000,000. But
in that he is mistaken, for there is a clear con-
traction of at least $9,000,000. The bill pro-
vides for the issue of $95,000,000 of bank
notes, and that is the whole expansion provided
for. But it also requires the withdrawal from
circulation of $45,000,000 of three per cent,
notes, of $40,000,000 of legal-tender notes,
and an average reserve for the new banks equal
to twenty per cent, of the $95,000,000. Hence
the total contraction is $104,0005000, and the
total expansion $95,000,000, leaving an actual
contraction of $9,000,000.
Further, the bill proposes to increase the
bonded debt of the United States $114,000,000.
It has become the belief of the country, as it is
mine, that this Government, instead ofbeing
conducted in the interests ofthepeople, is being
solely and wholly " run " in the interests of the
bondholder and banker without regardi to the
people.
Mr. Speaker, bankers and bondholders have
rights. Have the people of the country none ?
This bill provides not only that this $114,000,-
000 shall be exempted from State taxation and
local taxation, but it undertakes to declare that
Congress shall not have power to tax these
bonds. I have not time to enter fully on this
question of taxation. If, however, there is otie
question more than another concerning which
the race to which we belong is peculiarly sen-
sitive, it is upon taxation. It was unjust tax-
ation which brought the head of Charles I to
the block. It was taxation which produced
the war of the Revolution in this country and
secured the independence of the American col-
onies.
To put this bill inoperation will cause a dead
loss to the people of $94,000,000.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. A loss of what
amount ?
lUr. MORGAN. A loss of $94000,000. I
will tell my friend how. You authorize the
banks to loan $134,000,000 to the Government
and to take Government bonds to that amount.
The Government becomes possessed of this
$114,000,000, and you require the Government
to take up $85,000,000 ot currency, leaving in
the Treasury $29,000,000 of the $114,000,000
exchanged for the bonds.
Well, the Government gives the banker its
twenty-five year bonds at four and a half per
cent, per annum to the
Amount of bonds 1*111,000,000
Interest on same lor twenty-live years  12 ,250,000
Aggregate cost  242,250,000
Deduct balance in Treasury  2'J,0U0,Cw
Total cost    213,250,000
Now, if tho bill fails, and at the end of
twenty-live years the Government
should pay the $85,000,000, principal and
interest of the sum required by the bill
to be taken up, we have  
Leaving dead loss, if bill carries, of  $94,500^)0
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Do you count
out the taxes to be paid into the Ireasury tor
each year? . , , „
Mr MORGAN". Do you mean by the banks?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Yes.
