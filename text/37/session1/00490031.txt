THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Services would seem to have been most needed in
the'great cause of human rights, he has been cut
down by the fiat of that wisdom which never
errs.
That he had extraordinary endowments, no one
will deny; and whatever contrariety of opinion
may exist as to the influence of his political pol-
icy and measures upon the destiny of the nation,
the verdict of posterity, the judgment of history,
will be, that he went down with his patriotism
ifnseduced, and with no stain upon his loyalty.
Henceforth his name is indissolubty connected
with his country's history. Many will esteem
the pages which chronicle his deeds as among the
brightest in our annals. All the just and good
will bend reverently over the records of his
closing career.
Mr. ANTHONY. Mr. President, to the af-
fectionate praises of friends, and the magnani-
mous eulogies of rivals, I hope it will not be
deemed presumptuous if I add a few remarks from
one who sustained towards the subject of these
resolutions the relations of personal friendship
and of political antagonism.
I first met Mr. Douglas soon after he had taken
his seat in this body, in whose debates and delib-
erations he had already begun to hold a leading
part, and with whose history his name has since
been so closely identified. The frank cordiality
of his manners, the unaffected kindness of his
heart, the directness of his speech, and the readi-
ness with which lie declared himself upon all the
questions of the day, made upon me that favor-
able impression which a more intimate acquaint-
ance strengthened and confirmed.
It is not my purpose to follow his public career,
or to enlarge upon the qualities of nis character.
That grateful office has already been performed.
But I have often thought that in his indomitable
energy and will, in the sturdy self-reliance of his
character, in his early development, and in his
rapid march to success, he was no unfitting type
of the American character. As a debater. Con-
gress has aiTorded to him very few equals, either
in this Chamber, or in the other House, vvhorr
his earlier honors were won. Inexhaustible in
resources, fierce and audacious in attack, skill-
ful and ingenious in defense, he parried every
thrust, and he struck with irresistible fury at the
weak point of his adversary. He was a party
man, but he loved his country better than his
party; and in the crisis which darkened the coun-
try in his latter days, he rose to the full height of
the occasion, and appeared in tin? full proportions
of an American Senator. His last utterances were
for the Union; his last aspiration was for his coun-
try; nor is that country unmindful of his renown
or ungrateful for his services. In the perils of
civil commotion, and amidst the shock of fraternal
strife, she pauses to weep at his tomb.
That voice to which we have so often listened
with earnest attention, upon which these crowded
galleries have hung hour after hour with unwearied
delight, is hushed forever; and that home, so late
the scene of genial and graceful hospitality, is
shrouded in gloom: and to those who sit in its
chambers of darkness, it seems that joy can never
again cross its threshhold. To them I dare not
address myself, for I well know that, at this time,
the idea of consolation would seem almost like
wrong to the dead, and that upon their ears words
of tenderest sympathy would fall almost with the
harshness of insult, But, Mr. President, you and
1 know that, in the good providence of God, time,
the healer, will come to them, as it comes to all,
and that what is now a bitter anguish will come
to be a chastened sorrow, softened by the recol-
lection of his greatness and his fame, consoled by
the honors which the American people will pay
to his memory.
The resolutions were adopted nem. con.; and
the Senate adjourned.

mittee of Ways and Means to report to the House,

authorize a national loan, and for other purposes.

were called into service until the 30th day of Juried

nated the sum of $6,000,000, or as much thereof
as may be necessary. j
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask the Houje
by unanimous consent to put this bill on its pas-
sage. It merely provides the money necessaiy
to pay the soldiers the amount now due them, f I
understand that there is great suffering amoiig
them for the want of immediate payment of the
few months' pay just due them. This is the only
means by'which that pay can be given to them.
I know myself that some of the volunteers are
suffering because they have not been paid.
Mr.VALLANDIGHAM. Ipresumethatthere
is no objection to the bill at all.
Mr. BURNETT, I do not propose to object
to it. I am fully satisfied that the House will pass
this bill; yet in justice to myself I cannot refrain
from announcing my opposition to the whole sys-
tem and scries of loan measures inaugurated by
this Administration.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed, and read
a third time; and being engrossed, it was accord-
ingly read the third time, and passed.
