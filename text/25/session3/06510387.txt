APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....3d Sess.
ceeding was to pass a series of resolutions, that
they were mtiodaced by the chairman, and that
they were amended in apaiticular manner on then
passage It was believed that a system of espion-
age was m terrible opeiation in this metropolis,
and began to be felt throughout every precinct of
powei in the land, but it was not imagined that
a member of Congress on a committee would de-
grade himself to the level of an infoimer, and leg-
ularly report its pioceedings to the President,
without license to do so lhat the Piesident
controlled the proceedings of the committee by the
bold request, amounting toan oidei to the commit-
tee to examine upon oalh such gentlemen as had
charged corruption and abuses against the heads
of Executive Depaitments, that the President did
inquire about the acts of the committee, was in-
formed by a member of the committee concern-
ing its proceedings, did indicate to that member,
hi conversation, and afterwards to the committee
itself, in writing, his desne that it should call
upon members of Congress to testify ¡o the hulk
of their speeches on the floor of either House in de-
bate, that the member and the committee obeyed
his desne and lequest, and did cause mem bets ob-
noxious to Executive diapleasuie to be summoned
to testify m raannei as the President had indi
cated m conversation and in his letter, and he
thus repelled inquiry fiom the Executive, and
turned an inquisition upon the two Houses of
Congiess, making the committee what he de-
nounced it to be, and invaded their privileges
and violated the Constitution, by holding members
dnectly accountable to hunfoi wads spoLcn m de-
bate—holding them accountable in the most odi-
ous and insulting manner, by the oppressive
tortute of a tat oalh ' that the Constitution pro
vides that "fot any speech or deba e in eithei House,
the Senators and Representatives s.!i \\\ not beques-
Uoned tit any othet place," that yet, notwithstand-
ing this sacied protection, the Piesident's veibal
and wnten, his secret and open oiders, were
summarily obeyed by instantly summon mghoai y
and honoied Senatots, and young and inexpeii
enced Representatives, topmge themsehes, on oath,
of their contempt to the Executive ' They obeyed
not the mandate of a master or summons of his
slaves, but a sense of obligation to the coun
try, to show that their speeches were not the
declamation of demagogues, not ad captandum
harangues, not merely" spaigeicvoces," to excite
false alarms, or to laise a senseless clamoi, but
that they solemnly believed the truths they had ut-
tered,eind were leady to seal that belief with their
oaths' That if they had spead befoie them the
whole catalogue of Executive offenses against
law, liberty, light, leason, justice, truth, puuci-
ple, preceden!, the Constitution, and the countiy,
they would scarcely expect to find one offense
moie ruthless than this official act of the Presi-
dent, charactenzed, as it was, by the worst prin-
ciples, piejudices, and passions, in violation of
his duty, and injurious to puvate lights and the
public institutions'
The House, the Congress, the nation should
rebuke this act with patriotic indignation—with
the indignation of fieemen, of jealous lovers of
liberty and of the law by which it was secured,
that they should defy it as they would treason
and tyranny, that if this Executive act and its
pretensions should be sustained and go unre-
buked—if it should be settled that there should
be no mquiuj into the condition of Government
without specific charges against its officeis—that
inquiry was tual and inquisition—that public
officeis were to be secure in their departments,
and the houses, papéis, and effects belonging to
the people,as private peisons in private rights—
that public seivants were as fiee as their masters,
the people, from all scrutiny—that they were not
subject, neither indeed could be, to reasonable
accountability—that they must be impeached be-
fore they could be called on to report to the peo-
ple—that select committees should not be ap-
pointed to a<!cei tain abuses—thatagents unknown
to the law might be piotected, for that very rea-
son, fiom all seaich into theirconduct—that there
should be no general and minute investigation—
that there was no constitutional power in the
House of Representatives to inquire into the
conduct of Executive officers—that there should
he no inquiry tending to impugn the veracity and

integrity of the President—that inquiries should
tend to lender odious those who institute them—
that the President might supervise and control
the proceedings ot both Houses of Congress, and
of then committees—that he might resist their
just powers—that he might convert their commit-
tees of inquiry into inquisitions upon themselves
—that he might officially denounce then proceed-
ings, gi o«¡sly insult then membei s in the discharge
of then duties, and violently trample upon then
most sacred privileges—then was utteily gone
all punty, all honesty in the Government, its
strength, its dignity, its glory, its freedom, itself'J  i
Such, an, was the letter of your refoim Piesi-
dent in 1837, when simple inquiries were ad-
dressed to him by an investigating committee,
1 then in mere mockery constituted, and such, su, t
were then my views of its character and tenden-
cy—views which have been more than eonfnmed
by experience, reflection, and time. When the I
indictments, the prosecutions, were piessed ume-
lentmgly against pool Watkms—when the Ad- |
ministration was ciyms, Shylock like, "my
bond, my bond'" against one of Mi Adams's
defaulteis, then " geneial and minute inquines "
weie not only lawful, but a duty, but, sir, the
moment the band of investigation touched one of
his "little ones," then inquiiy was woiso than a
" Spanish Inquisition "
I di<l not notice the peisonal attacks upon me
contained in this lettei, because Geneial Jackson
was honoied by office and by age He had fought
the battles of his countiy, and was the President
of the United States Besides, sn,the wiongs
of the countiy and the Constitution meiged the
individual wrongs of a person as insignificant
as I oi any othei one man or Representative But,
sir, could my voice now icach him m that retire
ment which he piofessed to desire so much, I
would, with all deference to him, but with still .
moie deference to truth and the public weal, '
inquiie of him whether I and my " r-ssociatcs"
were the "authors of unfounded calumnies"—
whether even " the seveie accusations of myself
and my associates" weie false—and whether "the
public servants, whom we assailed, would, in the |
estimation of all honorable men, have stood ac-
quitted >" I would ask him, had a full examin-
ation been permitted and aided by him, as it
should have been, whether his favontes could
have borne the scrutiny of mquny, and whether
inqtiuy would not piobably have saved millions
of the public money ? Sir, the President, in this
lettei, piated about the records of the Government
and the public documents as if he had read and
examined them I doubt whether he ever exam-
ined, or read to examine, any one subject thor-
oughly, whilst he was in office No, sir, I ven
tuie to gueii that Amos Kendall—" honest lago" I
—whose official misconduct was most likely to be
exposed, was the infamous author of this daring
outiasre, he was a tool fit to be its author, of
everv word and letter and doctrine of it, he was
the Piesident's thinking machine, and his wtta;
machino—ay, and his lying machine' Sir, if
General Jackson had been elected for the third |
term, one great good would have come of the evil
—¿linos Kendall would haie been wuihed to death '
Poor wretch, as he rode his Rosinantc down Penn-
sylvama avenue, he looked like Death on the palo
hoise—he was chief overseer, chief reporter,
amanuensis, scnbe, accountant general, man of
all woik—nothing was well done without the aid
of his diabolical genius Since Jackson's " )e
tuement," he has assumed to be obeyed himself,
instead of being a slave He has woiked hard
for his lever of mischief God send the country
may not suffer for h s pains in obtaining the su-
premacy which he now holds
Sir, I have read to you this letter and my re
poitupon it, to show the landmarks of the re-1
spective positions assumed by the Executive and
the Opposition in relation to inquiry and investi-
gation Í in 1837 You, see,sir, that the very fiist
principles of om Government weie denied by the
Piesident, and the very A, B,C doctrines of free
government had to be contended for by the Oppo-
sition, because they were denied and scoffed at
and trampled upon by the tools and advocates of
a lawless power They had the impudence to
appeal even to the Constitution itself to shield
them.   They raised the very shield of the people I

themselves fiom unreasonable search-warrants
and seizures, forsooth, as a safeguard and pio-
tection to thtm, the public seivants, against the
people's light of investigation, through their rep-
resentatives, into then conduct whilst plundering
the pockets of the people '
And, sir, not only did the Piesident thus resist
the light and the attempt of inquny by the House
of Representatives, but the heads of the Execu-
tive Departments, to a man, followed his exam-
ple—they all íeplied to the queues of the com-
mittee in the same tone and temper, especially the
Postmaster Geneial, Amos Kendall
You remember the name of the celebiated Al-
fred Hocker, who was so truly faithful to "the
pmty" Democracy as to withhold the votes of the
people in the election of Moore and Letcher, in
Kentucky, to give the mmouty candidate the re-
turn, whose acts have since been made felony by
the laws of that State To reward him for that
Demociatic party service, an honest and faithful
servant was íemoved from a post office at Stan-
foid, Kentucky, in order to make loom for this
ex postjaclo felon The committee determined to
inquire into the case, and, on Tuesday, January
31, the committee adopted a íesolution calling on
the Posfmastei Geneial foi nifoirmUion as to the
removal of the late postmaster at Stanfoid, Ken-
tucky Ihe next day this resolulion was com-
municated to the Postmaster General,and on the
4th of Febiuary the following letter was received

In leplv, I hive the honor to slate that the power of

would be a precedent tending to subvert them, I am com-

I bad received information of the most out-

Chickasaw and Choctaw treaties. It was repre-
sented to me that various companies and individ-
uáis weie combined m practicing these frauds,
that tl ey fiequently came into conflict with each
other in purchasing from the Indians, that the
Government land officeis there were more or less
concerned in the purchases and frauds, that the
settlers and honest people of Mississippi were
grossly cheated and imposed upon by the specu-
lator, that the State was likely to be shingled
over with conflicting land titles, that the Presi-
dent of the United States, in all cases of dispute
