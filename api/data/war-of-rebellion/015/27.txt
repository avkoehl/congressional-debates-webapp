NEW YORK, N. Y., December 31, 1865.

In connection with others specially alluded to, the following telegrams, extracts, reports, &amp;c., gleaned from private memoranda of myself or members of my staff, and numbered 1 to 30, are appended to the foregoing report of operations in the Mountain Department. It is not unlikely that dispatches received from the President may be also on file at the War Office. I will ask, however, to have his own included with the rest, as they serve to make clearer points presented. I would here add that for the topographical map of Cross Keys forwarded with report, * I am indebted to my late chief of artillery, Lieutenant-Colonel Pilsen.
