SUGAR LOAF, January 16, 1865 - 5 p. m.

Flag-Officer Pickney,

Wilmington:

It would be a great relief to me and conduce to the public defense for you to take charge of the river obstructions just below the city, and also man the batteries for their protection. Should you consent to do so, confer Captain James, chief engineer, now in Wilmington. The enemy now have one steamer in the river. I shall hold the position here and Fort Anderson, but it is possible they may pass our batteries.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
