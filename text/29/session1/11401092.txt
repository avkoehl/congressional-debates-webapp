THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 14,
gone. We passed it as a revenue measure. Why,
1 often hear it said—I saw it in the newspapers
the other day—that this tariff of 164*2 was never
designed for permanence—that it was a temporary
measure—that it was fmeed upon us by the neces-
sities of the times. Well, is not that tantamount
to an admission that it was passed as a revenue
measure? We know that there were three gentle-
men who voted for that bill on that ground, and
without whose votes the bill could not have been
passed. 1 refer to a gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, now in high station, [Mr. Buchanan,]—a
gentleman from New York, also in high station,
[Mr. Wright,] and my colleague at the time, [Mr.
Williams,] who gave as their reasons for voting
for the bill the necessitous state of the treasury.
Well, then, for that reason these gentlemen voted
for it; and now the gentlemen turn around and say
that our necessities having ceased, the law ought
to cease with them. Ilow can they pretend to de-
clare that it was not a revenue measure, and de-
signed as such ? Yet it is now assailed as not being
a revenue measure. It is denounced as odiouif,
tyrannical, and oppressive, although it 1ms accom-
plished everything that it was intended to accom-
plish. _ My honorable friend, the chairman of the
Committee on Finance, with whom it is my hap-
piness to agree on almost all matters that come
before us, justifies the bill before you upon the
ground that it will yield at least as much revenue
as the present law, "and, indeed, he thinks that it
will yield more. How he gets at that conclusion,
I do not quite comprehend." I have already said
that the gross revenue yielded last year was over
thirty millions. The revenue I have stated from
the table of the Secretary of the Treasury at
$28,922,936. Tt will be seen that this is neither
gross revenue nor net revenue, and hence a word
of explanation is necessary, for I desire the matter
to be understood. The gross revenue was over
thirty millions—the net a little over twenty-six
and a half millions. It would seem to most minds,
ut the first blush, that here there was a very great
expenditure for the collection of the revenue—near-
ly four mdlions. But out of (he gross revenue is
paid, in the first place, all the drawbacks upon re-
exportations, which amounted, in round numbers,
to $1,900,000. Then bounties to fishing vessels,
$300,000; and some other expenses taken out of
the accruing revenue, before it goes into the trcas-
m'y, and then comcs the expense of collection.
Mr. CALHOUN. What was the expense of
collection m that year?
Mr. EVANS. It was considerably greater than
in the previous year, it amounted lV$2,053,46*.
In the year before, the amount was £1,807,500;
and in the year preceding, <£1,458,442, and so on.
I do not mean to say thrif there is anything wrong
m that. 1 here arc a 20od many expenses which
are paid and come in under that head of expenses
of collection, which are properly not expenses of
collection at all; and 1 by no means mean to inti-
mate that the expenditure of last year was exces-
sive when compared with that of the former year,
because it may have happened—and 1 have reason
to believe that it did happen—that there was a con-
siderable amount of duty refunded which had been
collected under errors in former years. The mode
of doing business is, that that is paid by the col-
lectors, and they charge it to the expenses of col-
lection. Well, how does the honorable Senator
from Alabama expect to get out of this bill the
same amount of revenue which is obtained from
under the present law ? He told us that the average
rate of duty under the new bill would be twenty-
one and a half per cent. I have not counted it for
myself, though I thought it was not quite so much.
However, the Senator spoke of having made only
an approximation to the truth. Now, if the hon-
orable Senator from Alabama has not examined
this matter sufficiently, lie cannot make out his
table by his data. In the very breath in which he
tells us tnat twenty-one and a half per cent, would
be the average rate of duty, he told us that a hun-
dred and nineteen millions of consumption would
El? twenty-eight millions of revenue. But,
,^^"^s.twenty-ejglit millions, it would
g as jut $25,585,000. Now, the importations
4? r,?nsumed> amounted to $101,907,734,
which , nf Ae Register of the Treasury shows,

supposes it will be, the revenue will be $22,790,000.
| Prom that is to be deducted the expenses of col-
^ Icction, but not the diawbacksand fishing bounties
I and so on, as the goods arc consumed. Deducting,
: then, two million of dollars, and in one case you
have a revenue a little short of twenty millions,
I and in the other a little over twenty millions of
I net revenue. Now I think I have shown, even
by his own data, that by no sort of calculation can
I he get this revenue out of the bill upon the irapor-
] tations of last year, including his expected increase.

Mr. E. went on to contend that, on the showing
of the Secretary himself, the bill would fall short
of the revenue of last year more than three mil-
lions of dollars. The proposal was to substitute
for the present bill one relinquishing revenue.
That hill went to the other House, and was so
amended that the rate of duty on several articles
was increased—on some considerably increased.
The Secretary then takes the bill, and savs that it
has been improved, and will yield him more reve-
nue thnn his bill, although the Senator yesterday
contended that the duties were too hi<rh, and if
| lowered, would increase the revenue. The Secre-
tary then went 011 and alleged that, by increasing
the rates still more, and by adding other articles to
the list oC dutiable goods, the revenue would be
increased to §30.000,000. It was now his (Mr.
E.'s) province to look into that. They wanted
$30,000,000 gross revenue. What amount of im-
ports would yield that by the average rates of the
bill ? He thought he had already proved that they
must have considerably more than $140,000,000 of
consumption. The Secretary anticipated nothing
like that. Ilis highest estimate was $121,000,000;
and if they had gone on increasing the rates of
duties, did they expect to augment the importation?
They had, by the bill of the House,increased the
duties; and yet they expected to obtain the in-
creased importation. Could they consume that
amount? When had they done it? In two years
only—in 1836 and 1839—had they imported any-
thing like that. Did not everybody know the
effect of that excessive consumption of foreign
goods, though they did not pay for them? They
could hardly afford to have them given to them.
That enormous amount was brought in—not so
much more in quantity as the figures would indi-
cate—but so much more in price—and all knew
the disastrous consequences. Yet, in that exces-
sive year, when ail thought they, were so prosper-
ous, but $168,000,000 were consumed. Next year
they fell down to $119,000,000. The goods went
into the hands of merchants, who failed,and they
sold them at reduced rates to the retailers, anil
they failed, and the retailers sold them to the con-
sumers, and they failed; ^and Congress had to
enact a general bankrupt law to wipe out universal
debt. Thus, the land was impoverished—men
struck down everywhere, and yet they were said
to have got rich by excessive importations. A
word as to the ability to consume. They could
not afford to consume anything like $140,000,000
annually, because those that they traded with
could not afford to consume an equal quantity of
our produce. But great increase was expected
in the ability to consume. Increase of population,
it was said, would add to that ability. Let them
look at that.
Their ability to consume the products of other
nations was governed by the ability of other na-
tions to consume American products. Their abil-
ity to consume was not at all regulated by increase
of population alone. The population of the Uni-
ted States was doubling every twenty-five years;
but was the ability to consume doubling too ?
Not at all.' Were the European nations doubling
in twenty-five years? Were they increasing in
wealth—the means of consumption—anything like
the United States ? Not at all. Europe was com-
posed of two classes—the nobles, who consumed
to theTull extent of their wishes, and the people,
whose means of consumption were not increasing.
They were almost stationary; and yet it was ex-
pected that they would be able, every twenty-five
years, to double their imports, so that America
could double hers! It was all a gross fallacy. So
he would expect to sec that the amount of their
revenue and imports would bear a constantly de-
creased proportion to their increase in population
arid wealth. Their consumption would, indeed,
increase, but it would be an increase in the con-
sumption of their own products. Gentlemen were
assuming all along that because the United States
was increasing in population and resources, there-
fore Europe was increasing in ability to trade with
them. It was not so at all. He knew the answer
that would be made to this—that inasmuch as the
United States exported largely of cotton they were
enabling the laborers of Europe to live in comfort
and to purchase largely of their exports. What
did the United States import from England ?
Goods in their finished State. W>hatdid they ex-
port? The raw material to be increased in value
by the labor bestowed upon it abroad. Well, then,
the United States in importing fifteen millions gave
seven and a half millions to capital—to large man-
ufacturers—added nothing to the ability of the con-
sumers of the poorer classes. Those persons to
whom the additional compensation went, were not
likely to expend it on cotton cloths. An addition
to their comforts not supplied by the United States
might be the result. Their few additional shil-
lings a week would be expended, as their wages
now are, in their daily sustenance—things of
the sort which made up the comfort of a laborer's
family. And all the rest of the consuming com-
munity desired no reduction in the price of the ar-
ticle sent by the United States, as they now con-
sumed to the full extent of their wishes. He
would suggest to his honorable friend [Mr. Lewis}
that he had not taken into account the diminution
of the ability of the American laborer to consume
by the decrease of his wages. When a hundred
thousand laborers had been turned out of the iron
and coal mines of Pennsylvania—when they had
stopped the machine shops and the factories—who
were to be the consumers of this vast expected in-
crease of importations ? All that gentlemen ap-
peared not able to understand. But such was ex-
perience. They produced fifteen hundred million
of commodities at home—if the amount of this
jfroduetion was struck down, was not the ability
to buy also struck down ? Now, if they crippled
the people of this country to a small extent, they
crippled the revenue to a great extent. He would
show that briefly. He would suppose that every
person curtailed his expenses two and a half-per
cent., would not the curtailment be chiefly on those
articles imported? Certainly. Luxuries would
be given up. Four-fifths of the whole curtailment
would fall on the articles of foreign import, thus
reducing the foreign imports from one hundred
