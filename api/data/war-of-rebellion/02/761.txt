HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MARYLAND,Fort McHenry, July 24, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

SIR: I received your confidential dispatch last evening, with the letter inclosed, concerning the "Winans arms."* Major-General Banks doubts the fact stated, and thinks that a search would excite a great deal of feeling among the Roman Catholics. I sent for a special agent of the police, and directed him to station policemen by night and day near the only two nunneries, as he thinks, in the city, and keep them in constant supervision. If they are entered by any unusual number of persons, or if any attempt is made to move the arms in case they are secreted there, as conjectured, the whole police force, aided by the military, will be called out. In half an hour two regiments can be concentrated at either point. In the mean time, if any circumstance occurs to confirm suspicion, I will not hesitate a moment to institute a through examination of the premises.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX.
