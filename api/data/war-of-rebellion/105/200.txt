Report of Lieutenant Anthony Ethier, Second California Cavalry.

CAMP DOUGLAS, UTAH TER., April 6, 1863

SIR: I have the honor to report to the colonel commanding that in pursuance of orders of the 26th of March I started with twenty-five men of Company A, Second California Volunteer Cavalry, at 6 p. m. After traveling thirty miles, encamped that night at the mills on the borders of Great Salt Lake. Next morning the 27th, raised camp at 7 o'clock and arrived at Knowlton's ranch, Skull Valley, at 6. 30 p. m. Distance of fifty-five miles from the mills. Next morning, the 28th, at 7 o'clock started across Skull Valley to Hastnig's Springs, accompanied by Mr. Knowlton and five of his men. Finding no sign Indians, crossed the Cedar Mountains and traveled ten miles due west on a desert. Finding no sign of Indians returned to west side of Cedar Mountains and camped at 8 p. m. without water. Distance traveled, thirty-five miles. On the morning of the 29th raised camp about daylight; traveled six or eight miles southward on the western side of Cedar Mountains examining all the ravines for Indian signs; finding none, recrosed Cedar Mountains nearly opposite the Beckwith Springs, then returned to Knowlton's ranch; distance traveled, thirty-five miles. Next morning, the 30th, raised camp at 6 o'clock; traveled southward down Skull Valley toward the mail route, and arrived at Simpson's Springs at 9 o'clock that night. Distance traveled, sixty miles. Men and horses very tired. Horses very sore-footed by reason of traveling through a rocky and uneven country. Next morning, the 31st raised camp at 10 o'clock and traveled to Point Lookout. Distance, eighteen miles.

Started from camp at 3 a. m. the 1st instant, and proceeded to Rush Valley and took breakfast there. Here I received General Connor's dispatch to return to Camp Douglas immediately. Started again at 8 o'clock for Camp Crittenden. Arrived there at 2. 30 p. m. At 3 p. m., while looking through a spy-glass, saw some Indians coming out of Trough Canonk, traveling on the estern side of the western hills. My horses being very much jaded and sore footed, I required the mail agent, Mr. Wallace, to furnish me with a coach. Myself with thirteen men in the coach and eight mounted on the best horses proceeded to overtake the Indians, which we did at Cedar Fort, they having taken a position for battle previous to my arriving there. The natural defenses of the position were very strong, which you will see by the diagram* accompanying this report. The Mormons through treachery, I suppose, and wishing to see my party destroyed, gave me false report as to the position of the Indians and also in regard to their numbers, there being at the time but two Indians in sight, chiefs on horseback riding the war circle. In examining the ground I saw what I throught was their actual position. I acted on my own judgment, not on the information received, which I firmly believe saved my party from destruction. After forming my line of battle, as you will see by the diagram, my men advanced gallantly to the attack, but receiving a withering fire from a quarter we least expected, we were forced to give way. Returning againto the attack, had the pleasure of seeing one of the chiefs fall mortally wounded. There being no more Indians, in sight, and continuing to receive a severe fire from an unseen foe, I concluded to
