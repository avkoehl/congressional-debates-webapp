All the railroad in this State have been returned to the original owners.

The expenditures in North Carolina from February 6 to June 30, 1865, amounted to $967,847.53.

V.-MISSOURI.

In October, 1864, orders were received to have the bridges rebuilt which had been destroyed by the rebels on the main line of the Pacific Railroad of Missouri and its southwestern branch. This work was completed April 1, 1865, at a cost of $170,564.65.

VI.-ARKANSAS.

The only lines used in this State of military purposes is a portion of the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad, between Devall's Bluff, on White River, and Little Rock, forty-nine miles long.

This did not come under control of this office until May 1, 1865. At that time it was in exceedingly bad order, and required large expenditures to make it capable of doing the work required of it. At this date it is still operated as a military railroad line.

In the foregoing statements it is shown there was in operation within the last fiscal year the following aggregate number of miles of military railroad lines:

Miles.

In Virginia................................... 430

In Military Division of the Mississippi....... 1,062

The above does not include the locomotives and cars built in the fall and winter of 1864, which, owing to the close of the war, were never sent to the roads, but sold at the manufactures" or at points where stored.

Of these, there were 35 locomotives and 492 cars of five-feet gauge, designed for the Military Division of the Mississippi and North Carolina; 50 cars of four feet eight and a half inch gauge, for Virginia and North Carolina; and 9 cars of same gauge used on the Western railroads to transport five-foot cars from the makers to the Ohio River, making in all 551 cars.
