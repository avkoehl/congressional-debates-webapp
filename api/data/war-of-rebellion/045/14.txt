Colonel ALEXANDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

Colonel Duffie was to have crossed the river at Sulphur Springs this morning with 2, 500 men. I have not heard from him yet. The information sent yesterday has been partially corroborated; none of it denied. Yesterday cannon firing was heard toward Culpeper. I suppose it was a salute, as I was told Stuart was to have had that day an inspection of his whole force. Six days ago, Hood's command was on the Rapidan, at Raccoon Ford. I can't learn that there is any infantry north of the Rapidan, but am certain there is a very heavy cavalry force on the grazing grounds in Culpeper County.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
