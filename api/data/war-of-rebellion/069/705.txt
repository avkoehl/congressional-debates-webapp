General BUTLER:

I have made the necessary preparations for placing a battery in advance of Spring Hill, and came down to see you about it. The force to cover battery until completed will have to be pretty strong, or we may lose it. I will await your orders at my headquarters.

I take three regiments from Terry and one from Turner, making 1,800 men in all. I had better take a battery had I not? I have sent for General Kautz, to confer with him before I call again to see you.
