instad of being compelled to receive the notes of
all the local banks, in the country, would not take
even its own notes issued by the different branches
It commenced in this wa>, but at an early penod,
in 1818, he believed, it adopted a different system,
and the mtes or drafts issued by the different
branches were refused to be paid at the parent
bank and the branches, except the one issuing
them This rule converted the branches into so
many independent banks so far as regards their
issues, and this practice, which was believed to be
in violation of its charter, was justified on the
ground of necessity. The Bank declared that it
could not carry on its business, that it could not
exist, if compelled to receive the notes even of its
own branches. As to the bills of the State banks,
it refused all extept those in the same town or
place
The Senator from Viigtma is afraid to trust the
Secretary, he fears he will oppress the banks, and,
on the giound of this suspicion, he wishes to take
aw y all disci enon, and compel him not only to
receive indiscriminately the notes of the nine hun-
dred banks in the country, but also to pay them
out, whether it is for the interest of the Treasury to
do it or not
Mr N said he would agree with the gentlemen
so far as this that the discretion ltft with the Se-
cietary was too great, but he íegarded it as a con
sequence of the system cf using the lecal currency
of the States The true remedy for this was to re
tu n to the lawful and constitutional currency, that
would remove all difficulties, and leave no occasion
for a disoretionaiy power He would not, how- ,
ever, say that there was not a middle course, he
thought there was, and that the discretion of the
Secretary might be limited and regulated by
law, but his honorable friend had not gone
to work m the right way to accomplish this
object, he should apply his discriminating and re-
gulating principles not to the disbursement, but to
the receivabihly of bank notes He does not seem
disposed to do this, he wishes to throw open the
door of the Treasury to all the local currencies of
the States, and then to take away all discretion
from the Secretary m regard to the same Sir, if
there is to be any restriction on Executive discre-
tion, it must be in regard to the icceivability of
the notes of the local banks This might be an
improvement upon the present practice, and on
this subject we are not without light to guide our
course This light is from a souice which he
hoped the Senafor would re~pect, and which he
was sure his friends over the way would respect,
they were bound to respect it The authority and
example was one which they could not d sregard,
it w ill not do for them to deny that the late Bank
of the United States acted on correct principles in
the collection and disbursement of the public re-
venues And what was the practice ot this institu-
tion m regard to the local banks when the collec
tion and disbursement of the revenues was farmed
out to it' The Senatoi from Missouri, [Mr Ben-
ton,] informed us yesterdaj what it was, he read
to the Senate the general rules of the ¿ink, by
which its conduct was regulated The e rule
were, that the notes of no State banks should be le-
ceived for public dues except those of banks in the
eity or place where the Bank of the United States
cr its branches w ere located All State bank noies
were excluded except those in the place where the
payment was to be made And the notes thus
received weie to be returned once a week, and the
balance demanded m specie or its equivalent The
notes of the State banks were not pai I out at all,
they were returned on the banks issuing them week-
ly for payment Such was the manner in which
your revenue was collected when it was firmed
out to the Bank of the United Slates But we
heard no complaints then, this practice was not
then deemed oppressive or unreasonable But
suppose the Secretary should adopt a course a^ le-
stricted and unreasonab e as this' My word
f<sr it, sir, the welkin would ring with cries of op-
pression, distress hostility to the banks, war on the
currency, on the credit sjstem, and the like The

cers of the Government, acting under a hig i re-
sponsibility, but he cantiust a bank, acting with-
out responsibility, and governed by no other prin-
ciple than its own interest. Ought not your own
Treasury to be placed on as favorable a footing in
regard to the local banks as a great moneyed in-
stitution, which had the use of your revenues for
nothing, or the mere trouble of collecting ?
Sir, said Mr N I am willing to restrict the Se-
cretary by enacting the rules of the late Bank of
the United States, indeed, he would be more libe-
ral, more indulgent, and enlarge the circle of the
banks whose n tes should be receivable, and be
satisfied with their being returned for payment once
a month, instead of once a week
It seems to be «upposed, sir, that there is great
hardship, that theie is something oppiessive, in
calling on the banks to redeem their bills We are
to be compelled to receive them, with an express
prohibition a"ainst presenting them for payment
On what ground is it, that it is claimed we ought to
receive the notes of specie paying banks' Is it not
on the grouna of their convertibility, that they aie
equivalent to specie, because they can be convert-
ed into specie on ptesentment' No one, sir, daies
to propose the receipt of inconvertible paper, but
we are called on to t ike convertible paper, because
it is equivalent to specie, and can at any moment
be exchanged for specie, and, in the same breath,
it is pioposed to take away its convertibility, and,
so far as the United States are concerned, to re-
duce it to a level with uredeemable paper Such
appeared to hnn to be the stiange inconsistency of
those who urge the propriety of receiving the issues
of specie paying bulks, and yet wish to take from
the Treasury the power of demanding specie lor
their bills
But, sir, it is not difficult to see the scope and ob-
ject of the resolution before us It is intended to
make this Government the general absoibent ol
the paper currency, and this, on the ground, m
part, of aiding the banks in resumption At a
time so critical and peculiar as tht present, we ire
to apply a powerful stimulus to the banks And
why shall we do this' We aie told, to aid the banks
in resuming But the solve it and prudently con-
ductly batiks do not want this artificial aid, they
are resuming'without if, they choose to stand on
their own strength, and know they could stand on
no other
The error in o u legislation, foi so no years past,
has been, that we look only at the peculiai state of
the n renut and the country at the piesent time
Congress has not acted with even the ordinary fore-
sight which belongs to individuals Miny years
ago, the Senator from Mas aehusetts [Mr Wis-
sti r] said that, in matters of finance it belonged
to Government to have a little more foiesight than
peitlined to private individual It was a very
just obseivation, but he regret td that the Senator,
m his course since, had not been more fortunate in

At that period, the-e w as a scarcity of money , and
a stignation of bu°inc s, and not looking beyond
the existing state of thr0s, it seemed to have been
supposed that the importan jns would be greatly
reduced, and that the revenue would rapidly fall
off An empty Treasury was then the subject of
apprehension, and bold and persevering a tempts
were made to alarm the country on this account
The banks would not be able to do any business,
commerce would declne and all he sources of re-
venue be dried up He did not know that any legis-
lation wascon>ummated, ¡springing fiom the views
of the subject, but tt.is was owing to the disagree-
ment between the two Houses But the majority in
the Senate hen entertained tue sentiments he had
expressed They wished to adopt measures to
stimulate the action ot the bnnks, and revive com-
merce, and without the aid of Congress, it wascon-
fi len'ly asserted that the monetary affairs of the
countrv could not be lestored to a heaithiul state,
and commerc could not revive

the other banks followed, which continued during
the years '35 and '36 Business became unusual-
ly active, the importations during the two years,
exceeded by nearly one hundred millions the ex-
ports, as well asthegeneralaverageof importations
for the five preceding years. The sales of the pub-
lic lands were equally unprecedented, amounting
in the two years to more than forty millions; and
the revenue flowed into the Treasury like a flood
tide, so that instead of an empty Treasury, the
great difficulty was to get rid of an immense and
alarming surplus. To dispose of this surplus, and
diminish the revenue, was the great object at the
last two sessions of Congress Having disposed of
the surplus in 1836, Congress in 1837, was occu-
pied during the who'e session m devising measures
to reduce the revenue A bill to check the sales of
the public lands, by confining them to actual settlers,
and a bill to reduce the imports were among those
measures Fortunately they were net consummated
AM these measures originated from the state of
things existing at the time, without apparently
much foiesight, as to the changes which might rea-
sonably have been anticipated
And now, sir, with this experience before us, we
are s'ill going on in the same waj, we are legisla-
ting for the present condition of the country, with-
out the least foresight, the blunders of preceding
years are lost upon us, we are as blind as ever,
and cannot see beyond the present moment Sure-
ly, sir, we afford but little evidence that Congress
possess more foresight than belongs to individuals.
We are now urged to adopt this resolution, to ap-
ply a powerful stimulus to the banks, toforce them
into premature action, and by forced means, give
activity to business If this, or any other measure,
would have such an effect, tliat would be the
strongest reason why it should not be adopted.
Shall be go on making laws for the present mo-
ment only, or shall we look a little aheat' Shall we
suffer the lessons of the past to be entirely lost?
Surely, sir, no great sagacity is necessary to per-
ceive that the present state of things cannot con-
tinue long The tide has long been out, and is
now beginning to return, and shall we thojgbt-
lessly build our house at low-water mark, so as
to be swept away by the returning flood. Are not
the fluctuations, the flood, and ebb tides m our
monetary affairs and commercial interests, as cer-
tain, although not quite so regular, as those of the
ocean'
Now, sir, is the t'me to have an eye to the future,
and not to be wholly influenced by the present pos-
ture of affairs What the country wants is stabi-
lity stability in its legislation, its revenue, its cur-
rency, and its commerce The revulsion has spent
its force, the crisis is already past, the country is
gradually recovering, and business returning. This
process has been going on its its natural way, and
has gone on as fast as it could with safety. To at
tempt to force it, will be highly dangerous, and
probably eminently mischievous When there has
been a long course of over action, brought on by a
rednndint currency, *he principal difficulty in gel-
ting back to a he Uhful state of things, is in re-
ducing the curr^icy and bringing down prices,
which had acquired a factitious elevation Tms is
attended with sacrifices ard sufferings The coun-
try has already passed through this scene the cur-
rency has been reduced from one hundred and fifty
millions to one hundred millions of dollars, a re-
duction of thirty-three per cent in one year, and
prices aie also reduced m proportion Our imports
having stopped, and the exports been continued,
foreign exchange has become favcable, and specie
is flowing into the country In this state of things,
the banks require no artificial stimulus having re-
duced their excessive issues, they cannot help re-

case with those in some of the Southwestern States,

When the country has passed the crisis, and is
