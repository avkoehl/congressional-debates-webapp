companies of cavalry; the Second Cavalry, on the left, drawn up by squadrons, Brackett's Minnesota Battalion on the right in the same order, Jones' battery and four companies of cavalry as a reserve. The few wagons I had closed up, and the rear guard, composed of three companies, followed. In this order we advanced, driving in the Indians till we reached the plain between the hills and mountains. Here large bodies of Indians flanked me. The Second Cavalry drove them from the left. A very large body of Indians collected on my right for a charge. I directed Brackett to charge them. This he did gallantly, driving them in a circle of about three miles to the base of the mountains and beyond my line of skirmishers, killing many of them. The Indians, seeing his position, collected in large numbers on him, but he repelled them, assisted by some well-directed shots from Jones' battery. About this time a large body of Indians, who were ascertained afterward had been out hunting for me, and with the rear guard dispersed them. The Indians, seeing that the day would not be favorable for them, had commenced taking down their lodges and sending back their families. I swung the left of my line round to the right and closed on them, sending Pope will his guns and the Dakota cavalry (two companies) forward. The artillery fire soon drove them out of their strong positions in the ravines, and Jones' battery, with Brackett's battalion, moving up on the right, soon put them to flight, the whole of my line advancing at the same time. By sunset no Indians were on the ground. A body, however, appeared on top of the mountain over which they had retreated. I sent Major Camp, Eighth Minnesota, with four companies of the Eighth Minnesota, forward. They ascended to the top of the hill, putting the Indians to flight and killing several. The total number of killed, judging from what we saw, was from 100 to 150. I saw them during the fight carry off a great many dead or wounded. The very strong position they held and the advantages they had to retreat over a broken country prevented me from killing more. We slept on the battle-ground that night.

The next morning before daylight we started to go round the mountain, as I could not get up it with wagons and artillery in front. After six miles march, I came in sight of the trail on the other side the mountain, but could not get to it. One sight of the country convinced me there was no use trying to follow up the Indians through such a country and find them. I went on top the hill, and as far as I could see with my glass (some thirty miles) the country was cut up in all directions by deep ravines, sometimes near 100 feet deep, filled with timber, the banks almost perpendicular. I therefore though the next best thing to do was to destroy their camp. This I did, ordering Colonel McLaren, Second Cavalry, on that duty. I inclose you a report* of property destroyed by him. That afternoon I marched six miles from the battle-ground and camped. About dark a large body of Indians came on to my picket and killed two. A command was immediately sent after them, but they fled in all directions. They made no further demonstrations on my march to this point, which I reached yesterday, my animals well tired out, having made a march of over 165 miles in six days, one day being occupied in the fight.

The officers and men of my command behaved well, and all appeared desirous to carry out my instructions as well as they could.

My thanks are due to the officers of my staff for communicating my orders promptly, sometimes being obliged to expose themselves very
