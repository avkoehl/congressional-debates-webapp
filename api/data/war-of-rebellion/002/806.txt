HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 6, 1861.

Colonel P. ST. GEORGE COCKE,

Commanding Virginia Forces, Culpeper Court-House, Va.:

COLONEL: You are desired to post at Manassas Gap Junction a force sufficient to defend that point against an attack likely to be made against it by troops from Washington. It will be necessary to give this point your personal attention.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 6, 1861.

Colonel JUBAL A. EARLY,

Rocky Mountain, Franklin County, Va.:

COLONEL: You are directed to repair to Lynchburg, Campbell County, Va., and to take command of the troops that will be mustered into the service of the State at that point by Lieutenant Colonel D. A. Langhorne. You will organize these troops into regiments, associating, as far as possible, troops from the same section of the State. The troops from the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Roanoke, Botetourt, and Craig are to be united distinct from those of the other counties, except so far as may be necessary to complete their organization. Place them under such officers as may be available, until their proper officers are appointed by the governor. You are requested to organize, instruct, and prepare the whole force for service at as early a day as possible, and to report, as soon as possible, the number of companies mustered into the service of the State, their arms, condition, &c.

I am, respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 6, 1861.

Colonel T. J. JACKSON,

Commanding Volunteers, Harper's Ferry, Va.:

COLONEL: I consider it probable that the Government at Washington will make a movement against Harper's Ferry, and occupy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad with that view, or use the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal for the transportation of troops. You are desired to watch these avenues of approach, and endeavor to frustrate their designs. On receiving certain intelligence of the approach of troops it will become necessary to destroy the bridge at Harper's Ferry and obstruct their passage by the canal as much as possible. You might make some confidential arrangements with persons in Maryland to destroy the Monocacy railroad bridge and draw the water out of the canal, should there be assurances of the enemy's attempt to make use of either.

You are authorized to offer the payment of $5 for each musket that may be returned of those taken possession of by the people in and about Harper's Ferry.
