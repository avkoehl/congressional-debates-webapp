Your wagons carrying commissary stores being light should carry some fine forage. Your quartermaster wants to provide for two batteries of two sections each (Benjamin's and Edwards'), from Crab Orchard. Benjamin can carry ten days' rations for his command, but nothing more. If there is any delay about the Second Maryland, let me know. You need not wait for it, but start the rest of your command as soon as possible. Surplus baggage can be stored at Nichlasville or Camp Nelson. Two wagons per regiment, including headquarters, are all that can be allowed. Abundance of transportation will report to you too-night. Telegraph how soon you

can move. You will want to fill up your trains at Crab Orchard. Move by the way of Barboursville and Cumberland Gap. You will move as rapidly as you can without breaking down your men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
