Major H. W. BENHAM,

Charleston, Va.:

SIR: Rumors and reports of a stronger character than any we have yet had speak of Lee being with Wise at Lewisburg, or this side of that place, with a large force, called 12,000 men, and moving this way. It is hard to say how much foudation it has, and I have sent reconnoitering parties to discover.

Very respectfully, yours,

J. D. COX,
