Mi W thanked the gentleman fiom dischaiging that duty
with so much abdity, and corcurr*d in every principle atf.
vanced by him Liice the gentleman he was a bank own con-
tending, as he ever should contend, for the power t>f Congress to
pa-ssa Bank bill, yet he could not vote for the one on the table if
it contained the lb h section with some otl er objectionable pro*
-virions, which thegentieman had portiaved with a pencil of
light Ilenevei had any scruples on thesubiectef a Bank,
and never was guilty of any concealment in regaid to it In a
distuctdoubttui as tegaids this question, and in a State alv^aya
opposed to it he had always ( penly suppoited his opinions aad
expressed with freedom ths 1 onaat convictions of his m'nd,
Mr W here íefened to his «peech in 18J7, and gave briefly
bis reasoi s for believing that Congress had the power to cieate
a Na'ionalBank.
After borne furthei lemaiks he said It was not to be con-
cealed that the qt e^tion of a Bank at this ¡>es&iun was like the
impotent man lying at the pool of Bethesda, waiting for the an-
g* 1 to come down , nó trouble the waters that he might átepia
and be made whole, and permit me to say that there is nooai-
uipotenee passing by to say to that impotent man, as Christ
said to the one lying at the pool of Bethesda, Arise, take up thy
bed and walk A pool mortal, however, seenigthathehasbeeri
lying theiefor moie than thnty mx years, aflhcted with this im-
potence mightsay to him 1 e theie a littit longer till the angel
comes down and troubles the waters What is this impotence?
It is a want of public confidence which this Bank has not had
foi the last thuty six yeirs And who is th" saviour that is to
restiie this impotent man to health? It is the people of the
011u.1l ¡states who, bv bestowtrg their confidence on 'he Bank,
(to drop the figure,) can give it huniiebs and "lability Theio
wis no evidence that the people aie}ctjiea('y for an mstuu ion
of this km , and Mr W denied that theie was any evidence
given by tlw late Pies dential election that the) h?d decided in
its favor He repudiated the doctrine which he saw laid down>
in an amele that appeared in the official or^an oi the majority
of that Hou*e on the subject of the passage of the distubutioa
bill [Here Ml W read the artiele f.t m the National Intelli-
^encer] What said Mi W h the doctime there laid down?
Ii.it that you must make hay while the sun shines'] No, that is
the doctrine of the wise man but if is the doctrine of a certain
