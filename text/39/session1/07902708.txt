THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 21,
for the survey, fortification. and impro\ement
of the sea-board, and i'or the support of a Navy
to protect our ocean commerce, equal attention
has not been accorded to objects of public
improvement in the interior, standing on the
same ground of constitutional authority and
the same principles of public policy.
The waters ot' the Mississippi drain an area of
1,2-14,000 square miles. They are navigable by
steam 1G.6V4 miles; and according to an esti-
mate of Mr. Benton, are boatable 50,000 miles,
of which 30,000 are computed to unite above
St. Louis, and 20,000 below. The commerce
which poats upon these waters moves, not to
a local market, but to the markets of the world.
It enriches the whole Atlantic commercial
region. It is a copious source of revenue to
the canals, railways, and navigating interests
of the East. The cities of Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, and Baltimore are participators
in it, in common with St. Paul, St. Louis, and
New Orleans. This commerce affects the
exchanges of the world, supplies the elements
by which alone foreign commerce can be con-
ducted. and contributes to the customs revenue
by furnishing the commercial marine the out-
ward-bound freight which is to be exchanged
for the return cargo. For internal trade is
the foundation of foreign commerce, which is
called into being and sustained by the domes-
tic commodities furnished for export. In
another form, it is an extension of it, distribut-
ing its freights. Each react upon the other,
and any attempted discrimination in favor of
one to the prejudice or exclusion of the other
defeats itself.
In the upper Mississippi valley are situated
the great food-producing States. Pour of these
States—Minnesota, Wisconsin,_ Iowa, and Illi-
nois, as well as the new Territories erected west
of Minnesota and a vast region extending north
far into British North America, to which a
railroad is now in progress of construction from
St. Paul—are directly interested in the improve-
ment of the upper -Mississippi river. But are
these the only parties interested? By the cen-
sus returns ot 1800 it appears that New Eng-
land raises barely a sufficiency of wheat to feed
her population three weeks ; and that for six
months in the year even New York is depend-
ent on the Northwest for her breadstuff's. The
tables which are annually laid upon our desks
from the Treasury Department show that the
products of the Northwest have, during the
recent war, sometimes constituted as high as
seventy per cent, in value.of all our domestic
exports, exclusive of specie. Is not the prop-
osition a true one, that in the same proportion
they have contributed to the customs revenue
and sustained the public credit? One thousand
dollars' worth of Minnesota wheat exported to
Europe will purchase there in exchange $1,000
worth of duty-paying articles. From the re-
turning imports the Government, under exist-
ing tariffs, derives an average duty in gold of
at least thirty per cent., or S300. Whatever,
therefore, by cheapening existingrates of trans-
portation, stimulates production, enlarges the
basis of foreign commerce ; and in the improve-
ment of the navigation of the upper Mississippi,
not alone the grain-growers and stock-raisers
of Minnesota. Iowa. Wisconsin, and Illinois
have a direct interest, but also the inland car-
rier, the eastern consumer, the ocean naviga-
tor, the consumer abroad, the foreign importer,
the buyer of imported fabrics, the miners of
Montana, Idaho, and British North America,
and the national Treasury itself.
The late civil war, Mr. President, has so
changed the character of our foreign commerce
that the leading staples of the South no longer
constitute, as formerly, the bulk of our ex-
ports. Food has for a number of years taken
the place of cotton, rice, and tobacco, and it is
reasonable to suppose that for some years to
come the settlement of European balances will
largel}' depend upon the exportation of food.
I regret that this should be so. I regret that
the industry of my own State is confined, too
exclusively, I think, to the culture of grain. I
know that owing to our distance from eastern
and foreign markets this culture has been un-
rcmunerativc to our farmers ; that in exporting
the products of our harvest fields we are ex-
porting the substance and richness of our soil;
and that if we continue so unprofitable a busi-
ness under existing disadvantages, depending
upon railroads for distant transportation, we
must decline to poverty. Hence the pressing
and patent necessity for improving the great
natural artery which has been fashioned to our
hands by the Almighty Architect. The cost
of transportation by the Mississippi river has
been estimated at three mills per ton per mile,
while by railroads of ordinary grades the tisual
estimate is from twelve and a half to thirteen
and a third mills. This gives a difference in
favor of river transportation of more than three ,
hundred per cent. The experience of the last .
few years lias demonstrated that bulky com-
modities will not bear the charges of railroad ;
carriage for any great distance. Where arti- |
cles are perishable, or where time is an ele- j
ment of value, railroads can be used to advan- i
tage ; but the fact is notorious that during the j
past year; with an average price for wheat in j
New York city of more than two dollars per :
bushel, the same wheat at shipping points on
the Mississippi river in Minnesota has brought
during the winter an average of but eighty-
five cents per bushel; to us a ruinous dis-
parity.
Let me also call the attention of Senators
to the fact that though nearly four million dol-
lars have at various times been expended for
the improvement of different portions of the
Mississippi river and its leading tributaries,
not one dollar of this sum has atany time been
expended to improve the long line of navigable
river which lies between the rapids of ilock
• Island and the falls of St. Anthony, and which
is the natural drainage of a region larger than
all of western Europe, and as fertile as any
upon which the sun shines. Without refer-
ring to the present rapid development of out-
lying settlements in Dakota, Montana, and
British North America, all more or less inter-
ested in this improvement, I will cite from the
United States census the increase which was
had in population, in cultivated lands, in agri-
cultural products, and in domestic animals in
, the bordering States of Minnesota, Wisconsin,
I Iowa, and Illinois, from 1850 to 18G0:

Remarkable, Mr. President, as is the prog- i
ress thus indicated in the decade from 1850
i to 1860 in these four States, these returns but
faintly show the present situation of the same ,
States. Notwithstanding the decline of im-
migration, and the stagnation of business in
many portions of the country during the war,
the material advancement of the Northwest ;
in the last five years has been unparalleled
by any equal period of peace. 1 will not,
occupy the time of the Senate with statistics
of the increase, in population and productions
during the last five years, of the States of Wis-
consin, Iowa, and Illinois, but will content j
myself with submitting a few statements which I
will illustrate the progress of Minnesota in this J
period—a State with which lam most familiar, j
and from which the growth of the other States !
may be inferred. The State of Minnesota has j
2,746 miles of shore line of navigable waters, i
Receipts by the La Crosse and Minnesota Steam Packet Company at La Crosse, Wisconsin, during the season of
navigation of the year 13G4, f rom March 20 to November 27.
In 1805 the number of steamers registered
at the single port of St. Paul was 39, with a
registered tonnage of 3,088.52, with a car-
rying capacity of 4,973 tons, and valued at
S607,500. The number of arrivals and depart-
ures of steamers at St. Paul in 1865 was 2.117.
Three steamboat companies transact busi-
ness on the upper Mississippi—the Northwest
ern Packet Company, from Dunleith and Du-
buque to St. Paul; the Northern, from St.
Louis to St. Paul; and the La Crosse and
Minnesota Steam Packet Company, from La
Crosse to St. Paul. Details of the business
done by the latter company in 1864 and 1865
have been furnished me, which I herewith
submit, premising that by multiplying the
sums total by three a sufficiently accurate
estimate of the business upon the upper Mis-
sissippi river in 1864 and 1865 can be
arrived at:
