CHATTANOOGA, October 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General WAGNER, Whiteside's:

Have a scout sent out to watch Steven's Gap and Crow Gap, below Trenton, to learn when the enemy passes the mountains, and report frequently the facts, whether the enemy is seen or not. I want to know early in the morning, if possible, what direction Hood has taken from La Fayette.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

WHITESIDE'S, October 16, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD;

Two companies cavalry left here to-day at 10 o'clock for Steven's Gap. The company to Caperton's Ferry has been changed to the direction of Steven's Gap. One hour ago a sergeant and five men were sent to find these companies, with instructions to find the enemy and report as soon as possible to this point and Chattanooga. Two hundred of our cavalry was at Trenton at 5 o'clock this p. m. Is it necessary to send a scouting party down the river below Bridgeport? There is no mounted force at Bridgeport. Have 150 cavalry in camp to send in any direction you may indicate.

WAGNER,

Brigadier-General.

A scout with cipher dispatch has just left here for Chattanooga, from General Sherman, whom he left at Snake Creek Gap at 5 o'clock this a. m. Our army expected to strike the enemy to-day. The scout says enemy has gone in direction of Bridgeport and Whiteside's. A number of discharged officers have just come in through Dalton; saw no enemy. These officers say that citizens inform them a portion of rebel army had moved to the right, toward East Tennessee.
