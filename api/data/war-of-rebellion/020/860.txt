RESIDENCE, EAST BANK SAINT JOHN'S [RIVER],

Near Palatka, Fla., April 2, 1863.

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN:

SIR: On Monday, the 23 ultimo, a large side-wheel steamer came up the river as far as Palatka and fired four shells over the town. She then returned to Orange Mill, and lay off that place until 2 o'clock Tuesday evening, and went down the river. While at the mill the Yankees butchered a beef, killed several sheep, and took on board a negro man named John, belonging to Mr. Frank Hernandez.

On Thursday morning a large propeller came up the river and lay off the mill until evening, when she came up opposite Palatka, abreast of the residence of Mr. Antonio Baza.

This force by land visited the plantation of Colonel Dancy and caught two of his negroes, one of which afterward escaped. They cooked and ate at this place and carried off all the poultry. The colonel's place on the river was also ransacked by the negroes. They also visited the plantation of Major Balling, destroying all they could, but did not succeed in getting any negroes, as, fortunately, they had been removed a few days previous. This land force, on arriving at the residences of Messrs. Sanchez and Baza, surrounded the places, and took 3 negroes from Mr. Morris Sanchez and other things of value from the yard. They did not succeed in catching Mr. Baza's negroes, but took from him three horses and one cart, all of his poultry, hogs, pots, salt, and everything else they could lay their hands upon. They also butchered two beeves in the yard. The negroes kept the houses surrounded, and
