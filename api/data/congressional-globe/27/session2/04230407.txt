ney would be honestlyexoended they could not in justice refuse
the appropriation Gentlemen would please consider the value
and the extent of the commerce of Savarnah. By a statement
he held m his hand it appeared that the exports of cotton and
rice for the year ending the 30th September, 1840, amounted to
an aggregate of $9,G2u,500, and theexpoits of lumber for the
same period amounted to twenty millions of feet, atan average
price of 10 centa per M. &2G0 000
fiy the same statement it appeared that the value ofthedu
ties on goods imported into that poit were $200,000, Gentle
men by this would see the importance of the commerce of that
port, and they would see the justice and expediency of
making the appropriation After a few mere remarks from

Mr BENTON moved to amend the above by striking out all
after the wurds  'pai value "
Mi BENTON moved to strikeout the authority to sell the
Government stock foi It ss than its par value He was too well
satisfied with the speeches of lies friends to make a speech him
self on this point They had shown that it was an impeach-
ment of our own ciedit, and a voluntary degradation of our
town stocks and must lead to its great depreciation thus to offer
it lie would repeat nothing that they had said but would
show that herea^am, as in all that thia administration was do
ing, we weie taking the English minister Sir Robert Walpole,
for our guide and example Mr B then it,ad some para
graphs from M'Culloch's commercial dictionary, and made a
reference to an article in the Edinburgh Review (ISo 93)to
show theongm and the injurious effects of this mode of hoi
rowing, which was commenced m the reign of George the Se
cond, and had been followed up in England until the Co* em-
ment was bound for two fifths moie of the debtfor money bor
lowed, they had ever received of the lenders Frimtheseit
appealed that Sir Robert Walpole to bamb wle the English
people with the idea of low interest on loans, instituted three per
cent stocks, to be sold in the rnaiket for what they would bring
— that those stocks sold for sixty orseventy poi nds m thehnn
di*d—and that the lender íecuved ceUifica'es foi ahnndred
pounds and mteiest of three pounds on this certificated
hui died, while m reah y he had but about two in nds
of that sum The result of ihe whole was that the
English people weie now hound mr two fifths more

It was in vom to ttj to bamboozle the people with one f feu*
Robert Walpole s old tricks it would all be understood and de
spised
Mr EVANS didnotproposeto renew discussions that had al
ready consumed si much time Every one must know that
the effect of th<= amendment of his amendment if adopted, will
ho to put it out of the power of the Secretary of the Tieasury to
exeirise any discretion for the advantage of the Government,
and to rendei the whole bill nugatoiy, and thereby stop the sup
plies He ti usted the Senate would not sanction the amend
ment
Mr KING said he was very desrous of being ab'e to vol*1
for the bill but unless it were modified in accordance witi
the proposition of the Senator from Missoun he did not con
ceive that he could without a violation of the duty which he
owed to the country, a   well as the Government, give tthis
support líe di 1 not think that the objection ur^ed by the Se
natoi fiom Mame against the amendment, p'?ced the
matter on a pioper footm? If he (Mr King) nghtly under
^ood the intent and bearing" of the amendment it was to shorten
the period of the continuance of the loan Let the Secretary
of heTrea ury go into the market aftd piocure the loan by
p i)mg arate of mteiest suffiau tlv high, and limit the dura
tion ot the loan It s°emed to him that it would be *ai better
to fixahsgherrate ofinterest,and to borrow the money fora
shorter period Although he (Mr King) had ie\ei had much
to do with the disposal of State stocks, he had hid sufficient,
however to show him conclusively that a more ready sale could
be effected by having a high rate of interest, and a short time to
run      And why,  he  would ask,    should    they   continue
ito  pay   a   high rate of interest, as   they inevitably musf,
for   such    a    number *of   years'     If  the   chairman
40?
of the Committee on Finance would take this view Of ther
subject, he (Mr K ) believed he might venture to say teat it
was the desire of every gentleman here to render the fullest as-
sistance to the Government in the way of providing meansfor
his support He had been askec\ as he already stated, to nego-
tiate stocks bearing a rate of interest of sis per cent. He went
into the New York money market and received proposal Be-
ginning at eighty five per cent and using to mnety*sevBn,
above which no proposal could he obtained, but when feede*
clared that he musthave four percent premium, those very
individuals who would not go beyond ninety seven per cent m
their proposals, very readily consented to pay the premium
of foar per cent when they found that the stock cou'd not -be
obtained at a lower rate, and so eager were they that they ac-
tually quarreled m his presence as to the proportions-that
each should receive And just so it would be with this loan.
They would get no proposal above eighty percent and to de-
duct twenty dollars from every hundred, and to pay the inte-
rest upon this twenty at six per cent for twenty
years, was a thing wh ch should not he seriously contemplated
for a moment Gentlemen talk about the degradation of our
credit, but the degradation of selling our stocks at a dervecia-
ted value, he thought ought equally to be guarded against,
and did it imply degradation to make specific arrangements for
discharging their obligations? Certainly not, unless it he degra-
dation to pay their debts at all Look at those States which
omitted to make provision for the discbarge of their obligations
What was their condition now m consequence of that omission?
One after another they were falling They were told that,
without a specific pledge, they should not get the loan upon
reasonable terms, no man would go farther than he would to
furnish the Government with sufficient funds for carrying on
its operations, but he was, at the t>ame time, desirous of pro-
curing the money upon reasonable terms lie did not intend to
make a speech upon the subject, at present, but had risen
chiefly to say that if they would not permit their stocks to be
hawked in the market for such price as might be offered for it,
he had not the slightest doubt that the loan could be procured
upon reasonable terms
Mr EVANS replied, characterizing the proposition to obtain
the loan at a rate of interest limited by any maximum, such as 10
pel cent as the worst possible ino le of procuring money irrthe
stock market, becauseit would be ar obvious temptation to the
monpy lenders to conspire together and refuse the loan, unless at
the maximum rate of interest Tins he expatiated upon at
considerable leng h
Mr YOUNG wished toadd a word to wl at had fallen fiom

Finance Committee was it piudent to send thisstoc! 10 England
