NASHVILLE, TENN., October 16, 1864 - 10 p. m.

(Received 17th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have information from General Sherman at Villanow. The enemy left Dalton at daylight on the 14th. The Fourth and Fourteenth Corps, having encamped the evening before at Tilton, pursued him on the road he took through Nickajack Gap, going west. The next morning Sherman, with the Army of the Tennessee, moved WEST from Resaca, through Snake Creek Gap and Villanow. I have directed Schofield to move with Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISION up Lookout Valley, for the purpose of intercepting Hood, should he be marching for the Tennessee, and to enable Sherman to get in his rear. News from Decatur and Rogersville indicates that the enemy's cavalry still occupy the south bank of the Tennessee, but no signs of a disposition on his part to cross. Re-enforcements are arriving at about the rate of one regiment a day, and are being disposed of as they arrive.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

(Same to Major-General Halleck.)
