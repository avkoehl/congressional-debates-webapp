HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 15, 1864-7 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Ferry over all your artillery and wagons at both ferries and get over as soon as possible. General Grant will require your big ferry-boats to take his headquarters, and would like to know at what time you will be through with them. The bridge is finished and we are crossing there.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

SECOND CORPS, June 15, 1864.

General MEADE:

I do not think I can get my artillery and trains over before 12 o'clock. The ferry-boats are the only ones I can move artillery or wagons on with any dispatch. I use some of the other boats for horses, for which they do very well.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding Second Corps.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 15, 1864-7.30 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

You will not wait for the rations, but move immediately to the position assigned you last evening. You will leave an officer to direct the boat with the rations to return to City Point or up the Appomattox to some more suitable point from whence you can draw them. The ferry-boats will not be taken from you till all your artillery and wagons are over; you can then unload ammunition wagons to haul supplies.

Your dispatch just received.* It is important you should move. Exercise your judgment as to which will be best-to issue rations now or send them as directed in the foregoing.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
