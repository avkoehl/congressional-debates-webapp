CUMBERLAND, January 11, 1865.

Major-General CROOK,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

The commanding officer at Philippi telegraphs that the rebels, 1,800 strong, are moving upon that post. This is not thought to be correct. He will get the regiment off for Grafton as soon as possible. Grafton is sixteen miles from Philippi.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 11, 1865-9.30 p.m.

Major-General CROOK,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

One regiment of General Duval's command will start for Grafton within two hours; another will probably get off by 4 or 5 o'clock for Clarksburg.

Respectfully,

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., January 11, 1865-8.30 p.m.

Brigadier General I. H. DUVAL,

Commanding First Infantry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you have one large regiment report at the railroad depot with the very least possible delay, to go to Grafton; the cars are now waiting for them. The regiment will probably be gone some three days. They need move nothing more than is absolutely necessary for their personal comfort. Let this regiment report as soon as possible. Brevet Major-General Kelley will give the commanding officer additional instructions. You will also hold one large regiment ready to move within a few hours, say by 2 or 3 o'clock to-night. Further orders will be sent you. They will also move by cars, and should not take anything more than is necessary for their personal comfort.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., January 11, 1865.

Brigadier General I. H. DUVAL,

Commanding First Infantry Division:

GENERAL: You will direct one regiment of your command (a large regiment) to report to-morrow morning at daylight at the railroad depot, for the purpose of embarking for Clarksburg. The camps will be left, and only such things as are necessary for the actual comfort of the men during their absence will be taken. They will probably be gone about three days. The officer in command will report in person to Brevet Major-General Kelley for further and full instructions to-morrow evening.

By command of Major-General Crook:

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
