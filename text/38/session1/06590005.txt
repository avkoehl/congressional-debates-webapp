APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBK
38th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Senate & Ho. op Reps.
formed upon probable events and conditions as
to the other quarters.
The following statement exhibits what is act-
ually known, and what, after careful reflection,
the becretavy thinks himself warranted in regard-
ing as probable:
For the first quarter, ending September 30,1863,
the actual receipts were:
From customs „ , $22,562,018 42
From internal revenue  17,599,713 59
From lands  136,182 09
From miscellaneous sources  641,542 04
Total actual receipts for first quarter  40,939,456 14
To which add balance July 1,1863   5,329,044 2J
Making total receipts of first quarter, except
loans  46,268,500 35
For three remaining quarters, end-
ing on the 30th of .Tunc, 1864, it is
estimated there will be received:
From customs $50,000,000 00
From internal revenue  60,000,000 00
From lands  300,000 00
From miscellaneous souices, 5,000,000 00
115,300,000 00
Making a total of receipts from ordinary
fcourees actual and estimated, and in-
cluding balance, of.   161,568,500 35
To winch add the actual and estimated re-
ceipts from loans  594,000,000 00
Making a total of actual and estimated re-
ceipts trorn all sources, for 1864 $755,568,500 35
The expenditures may be stated as follows:
For the first quarter, ending September 30,1863,
the actual disbursements have been:
For the civil service  $7,216,939 31
For pensions and Indians  1,711,211 95
For WarDepaitment     144,387,473 97
For Navy Department  18.511,M8 ^6
For interest on public debt  4,283.628 37
Actual expenditures for first quarter  176,110,932 46
For the remaining three quarters
the estimates, founded on appropria-
tions and estimated deficiencies, are
as follows:
For the civil service $27,050,SIS 21
For pensions and Indians... 6,129,042 86
For War Department 741,092,037 14
For Navy Department  94,467,567 74
For interest on public debt.. 5-1,881,508 01
  923,621,027 96
Making a total aggregate of actual and es-
timated expcndituies of. 1,099,731,960 42
But as these estimates include all unex-
pended balances of appropiiations fiom
former jeai-*, they are necessarily much
too large, and there may be sately de-
ducted from their aggregate, a?> likely to
remain unexpended at the close of the
fiscal year, the sum of  350,000,000 00
Leaving the total actual and estimated ex-
penditures tor 1864  749,731,960 42
The total of expenditures being deducted
lrom the total of leceipts, there will be
An estimated balance on the 30th of June,
lS64,of  5.830,539 93
From this statement it appears that the total
receipts required for the probable dis-
bursements ofthc year,and including es-
timated balance at its close, will amount
to    755,568,500 35
Of which theie have been provided and ap-
plied during the first quarter  176,110,932 46
Leaving to be provided  579,457,567 89
Oi which it is estimated there will be re-
ceived hom ordinary sources during the
three other quauers  115,300,000 00
Leaving yet to be provided by loans  $464,157,567 89
The amountof debt created during the quarter
is ascertained by deducting from the total cx-
penditures$176,110,932 46, the aggregateof ordi-
nary receipts and balance from last year, amount-
ing together to $46,26S,500 35, which gives as the
increase of debt $139,842,433 11. To this sum,
if there be added the sum yet to be provided by
loans, $4G4,157,5G7 89, the result will be $594,-
000,000, from which if there be deducted the es-
timated balance on the 1st of July, 1864, $5,836,-
539 93, the remainder will be $588,163,460 07,
and will represent the total incroasc, on the bash-?
of these estimates, of public debt during the year.
The debt on the 1st of July, 1863, was $1,098,-
793,181 37; to which if this estimated increase be
added, the total debt on the 1st of July, 1864, will
be {1,686,956,641 44, instead of,744,685,586 80,
as estimated in the report of last December.
It is not certain, or perhaps probable, that the
actual expenditures or actual debt will quite reach
the amounts now estimated. Indeed, if the ex-
penditures for the first quarter, $176,110,932 46,
and the ordinary receipts, $40,939,456 14 for the
same quarter, be taken as the standard, the total
expenditures of the year will be $704,443,729 84,
and the total receipts $163,757,824 56. To these
receipts, if the balance on the 1st of July, 1863,
$5,329,044 21 be added, it will make the total or-
dinary resources$lG9,086,868 77; and the subtrac-
tion of this sum from the total expenditures will
give the whole amount to be provided by loans
during the year as $535,356,801 07. This sum
will therefore be, on this hypothesis, the increase
of debt for the year, and, added to the debt ex-
isting on the 1st of July, 18G3, will make the total
amount on the 30th of June, 1864, $1,634,150,-
042 44.
It is not impossible that vigor in the prosecution
of the war, and economy in every branch of ex-
penditure, enforced by wise legislation, may re-
duce actual disbursements and consequentincreasc
of debt even below these figures, and certainly few
things can be more desirable than such reductions.
The action necessary to these results is not, how-
ever, except as to the comparatively small expend-
itures of the Treasury Department, within the
sphere assigned to the Secretary. He therefore
piefers to accept the estimates of the several De-
partments,and the actual appropriations by Con-
gress based upon them, deducting only that pro-
portion which experience has indicated as likely
to remain as balances unexpended at the close of
the year. He thinks, too, that sound prudence
requires adherence to the rule he prescribed to
himself from the first, of overstating rather than-
understating the burdens created by the war and
the demands thence arising upon the resources of
the country. He has sought to avoid exagger-
ation on both sides, but he has thought it more
piudent to excite a little too much apprehension
than to encourage too sanguine hopes. The real
difficulties have been, and are, too serious, and
the real burdens too great, not to warrant earnest
demands on all the resolution, all the energy, all
the wisdom, and all the economy, which the
strongest representations, sanctioned by reason,
could or can bring into action.
In addition to the estimates for the current year
just stated, the Secretary is required to submit
estimates of the receipts and expenditures of the
next fiscal year. These estimates, always uncer-
tain, must, in the present condition of the country,
be even less reliable than usual.
But the Secretary is encouraged to attempt them
by the circumstance that the estimates for the fis-
cal year, 1864, submitted in his report of Decem-
ber, 180:2, are less materially modified than might
have been expected by the actual receipts of one
quarter, and by the probabilities affecting those,
of the other three, and the general result is more
favorable than was anticipated.
The aggiegate receipts for 18G4 were estimated
in that report at $223,025,000, while the actual
receipts, other than from loans for the first quar-
ter, and the aggregate of expected like receipts for
the remaining quarters, aie now stated at only
$161,568,500 35, in consequence of the large de-
ficiency in the receipts of internal revenue. On
the other hand, the aggregate expenditures weie
estimated last year at $845,413,183 56, and are
now estimated, on the basis of actual returns for
part and of estimates for the remainder of the
year, at $755,508,500 35. The subtraction of ie-
ccipts from expenditures shows the amount now
estimated as required from loans for the year 1864
to be $594,000,000, instead of $G22,388,183 56, as
i heretofore estimated. These figures show that the
estimate of expenditures is now $89,844,633 21 less
than the estimate of last year; so that, although
the ordinary receipts as now estimated will be
$61,456,499 45 less than wasanticipated ayearago, !
still the increase of debt will be $28,3^3Jtf3 56 |
less bv the present than by the former (.•uimcue, !
which, it should be romcmbcVed, assumed the i
debt, on July 1, ]863, at #1,122,297,403 24,
whereas in fact it qjdy reached, at that date, the
sum of $1,098,793,181 37.
With these illustrations of the uncertainty of es-
timates forayear, which is to commence more than
six months after the making of them,' and without
professing an y sanguine expectations that the esti-
mates now to be submitted will, when tested :by ex-
perience, prove, lilce the last, less favorable to th£
country than the actual results of administration^
the Secretary submits the required statement tat
the fiscal year 1865, founded on the estimates of
their probable requirements furnished by the
several Departments, and on what seem to him
probabilities concerning receipts from ordinary-
sources of revenue.
He estimates the probable receipts as follows:
Estimated balance, July 1, 1864   $5,836,539 93
From customs  70,000,000' 00
From internal revenue  125,000,000 00
From lands     1,000,000 00
From miscellaneous sources  5,000,000 00
Making estimated aggregate receipts..$206,836,539 93
And he estimates the expenditures as follows';:
Estimated balance of former appropriations, unexpended
July 1,1864 $350,000,000 00
For the civil service  27.973,194 81
For pensions and Indians?... *   9,631,304 73
For the War Depaitment..   536.204,127 77
For the Navy Depaitment  142,618,785 40
Foi intciest on public debt     85,387,077 15
Making the aggregate of estimated ex- •
pendituich 1,151,815,088 86
But lie estimates us likely to remain un-
drawn on the 30th June, 1865, and there-
fore to be deducted fimn this aggregate.. 400,000,000 00
Making the real estimate of expendi-
tuies for the year 751,815,0S8\86
From winch deduct estimated receipts from
ordinary sources, as before stated..  206,830,539 93
Leaving to be provided by loans«.... .$544,978,548 93
The sum to be provided by loans represents the
increase of debt during the year. Assuming, there-
fore, thecorrectnessof the estimate which puts the
debton the lstof July, 1864, at$l,686,956,641 44,
it will result from these estimates that the whole
debt will have reached on the 30th of June, 1865,
the sum of $2,231,935,190 37.
Tables arc appended to this report exhibiting,
in more detail and in a different form, the general
results already stated. The first shows the act-
ual receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1863; the second the receipts and

two months of Octoberand November, J863, with
notes, showing m detail the amount received from
new loans and applied in discharge of existing
debt during the first quarter and the first two
months of the second, and the amount yet re-
quired from loans for the year, and the probable
increase ofthe public debt; the third shows the
estimated receipts and expenditures for the fis-
cal year ending June 30, 1865; the fourth is the
Register Is statement of revenue and expenditures
during the fiscal year ending June 30,1863; the
fifth is a similar statement from the same oilice
for the first quarter of the fiscal year 1864, end-
ing September 30,1863; and the sixth is a com-
plete statement of the origin, progress, and con-
dition on the 30th .Tune and 30th September, 1863,

The reports ofthe heads of the several bureaus
of the Department, including that of Comptroller
of the Cuii'ency and the Commissioner of Inter-
nal Revenue, will also accompany this report of
the Secretary. They show in detail the opera-
tions of the several bureaus, and the statements
and suggestions made in them are commended to
the consideration of Congress.
Another statement, showing the prices of the
leading articles of consumption at Hew York, on
or near the first day of each month, for thirty-
nine years, commencing with 1825,has been pre-
pared under the direction of the Secretary, and
accompanies this report. From this statement he
hopes that some help may be obtained toward
rorrect opinions on many important questions,
and particularly those concerning the contraction
