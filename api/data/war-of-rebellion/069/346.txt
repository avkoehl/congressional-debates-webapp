excellent service. I believe a strong force moving direct on to Machanicsville and Cold Harbor would probably get into a fight on fair ground without entrenchments.

Major-General.

MAY 30, 1864 - 9.15 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

I am much obliged for your kind wishes and efforts. We repulsed the enemy with severe los to him. The reason I wished General Crittenden to relieve Griffin was because his troops knew the ground where the attack was threatened, and his reserves were available as soon as your command arrived. Besides this arrangement kept our troops from getting mixed up together.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 9.30 p. m.

General MEADE:

General Griffin just sends me word that General Ayres has pushed out, since we repulsed the enemy, 1 1/2 miles without finding an enemy. Captain Paine's sketch of the position when he left will show you by this additional mile and a half how far he has gone.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

your dispatch reporting the position of your troops received. General Burnside reports his whole corps south of the Totopotomoy, and that he has relieved General Griffin. As your dispatch is read this will make your position secure, acting on the defensive. Sheridan reports Torbert's division of cavalry at Cold Harbor, Parsley's, and the cross-roads west of Parsley's and north of Cold Harbor, and that he pickets and patrols to your left, so that no movement of the enemy on your left can be made unnoticed. It is not intended to take the offensive to-morrow unless the enemy should attempt to interpose between you and General W. F. Smith, now at White House, and moving to-morrow to New Castle. Should the cavalry report any such movement, General Wright will be moved across to the left, and, in conjunction with you, the enemy attacked. You will, therefore, strengthen your position. Keep your communication with Burnside.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
