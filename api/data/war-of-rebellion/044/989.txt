(Received (. 40 a. m.)

SIR: Colonel Lowell goes to Washington to-day, to report, as ordered. He returned from his expedition last night, bringing in about 20 horses captured from Mosby, and all the prisoners taken by Mosby at Fairfax. The gang scattered in all directions, and thus eluded pursuit.

COLONEL: On Thursday afternoon [30th], I casually learned that Mosby, with some 60 or 80 of his band, was moving along the road leading from aldie to this point. I at once dispatched Colonel Lowell, with some 200 of our cavalry, in search of the party. They encountered them at daybreak the next morning within 2 or 3 miles of Aldie. A sharp skirmish followed, when Mosby's men took flight, and scattered in all directions, leaving behind them the wagons, horses, prisoners, and settlers' goods which they had seized the night before at Fairfax Court-House. Everything was recovered that the guerrillas had taken, and they themselves owed their escape to their intimate knowledge of the country. Our cavalry behaved with great spirit.

Very respectfully,

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
