ator from North Carolina asks consent to take
up a bill which was under consideration at the
adjournment yesterday, Senate bill No. 1163,
to relieve certain persons therein named from
the legal and political disabilities imposed by

from the House of Representatives that ought
to be laid before the Senate.
Mr. CHANDLER. I wish to present a
report.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Petitions

army supplies.
The bill (H. R. No. 2975) to amend the
fifth section of an act entitled " An act mak-
ing appropriations for the legislative, execu-
tive, and judicial expenses of the Govern-
ment for the year ending June 30, 1873, and
for other purposes," was read twice by its
title.
Mr. WEST. I think there can be no objec-
tion to acting on the bill now.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It provides that the fifth sec-
tion of the act approved May 8, 1872, making
appropriations for the legislative, executive,
and judicial expenses of the Government for
the year ending June 30, 1873, shall not be
held to apply to materials, stores, or supplies
sold to officers and soldiers of the Army on an
exploring or surveying expedition authorized
by law ; and that the section shall not be held
to repeal such part of paragraph ten hundred
42d Cong. 2d Sess.â€”No. 276.
and thirty-two Revised Army Regulations of
1863 as provides that the expenses of the sales
of military stores or supplies regularly con-
demned shall be paid from their proceeds.
Mr. CASSERLY. I do not object, but I
think there should be some explanation of that
rather obscure bill. To what does it refer?
What is the operation of it?
Mr. WEST. The act which this bill amends
requires that the proceeds of the sales of all
property made by the Government of the Uni-
ted States shall be covered at once in gross
into the Treasury, and that provision would
apply to the sales of stores to Army officers,
and the commissary department would not
be able to renew these sales in consequence
of exhausting their supplies. This provision
merely remedies that defect and enables the
exploring expeditions on our frontiers to sup-
ply themselves with commissary stores. That
is the whole object of the bill.
Mr. COLE. I will state a little further that
by the laws now the exploring expeditions are
furnished with supplies from the quartermaster
and commissary departments; but under the
fifth section of the law, passed not long ago,
they cannot get any supplies.
Mr. CASSERLY. I merely wished to be
satisfied that the law recently passed in regard
to the sales of materials by the War Depart-
ment was not to be materially changed. I am
satisfied that is the fact.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and
goods in bond.
The bill (H. R. No. 2973) to refund duties
paid on goods, wares, and merchandise re-
maining in bond or store on the 1st day of
August, 1872, was read twice by its title.
Mr. SHERMAN. That bill simply con-
tains an appropriation to carry into execution
a section of the tariff act passed recently,
and its 'passage is indispensable in order to
enable the Secretary to comply with the law.
I ask that the bill be considered at the present
time.
There being no objection, the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill. It provides that whenever
it shall be shown to the satisfaction of the
Secretary fo the Treasury that parties are
entitled to the refunding of duties paid on
goods, wares, and merchandise remaining in
public stores or bonded warehouses on the
1st day of August, 1872, under the provisions
of the sixth section of the act approved June
6, 1872, it shall be the duty of the Secretary
of the Treasury to draw his warrant upon
the Treasurer, directing him to refund the
same out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.

post routes.
The bill (H. R. No. 2976) to establish cer-
tain post routes in Georgia was read twice by

Mr. FENTON, from the Committee to
