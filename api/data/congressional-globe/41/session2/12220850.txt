THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 28,
motion is not, under the rules of the Senate,
allowable when any other business is before
the Senate, except by postponing that business
for that purpose. Is there objection to the
proposition of the Senator from Ohio, [Mr.
Sherman,] that the Senate proceed to-morrow
at three o'clock to vote on the currency bill?
Mr. EDMUNDS. Yes, sir.
Mr. CAMERON. I object to any such
arrangement.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Pennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont
object.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to explain why I
object. It is not that I do not wish to come to
a vote, but the nature of this bill is such that
amendments may be offered at any moment
which will require from the committee or from
others some discussion, i do not think it,
therefore, the kind of proposition on which we
could have such an understanding with safety.
That is my only reason. I am anxious to have
a vote upon it.
Mr. SHERMAN. I simply desire to get the
bill off my hands, so that I can attend to some-
thing else. The debate ha3 now gone on for a
week and it seems to mo a proposition so
simple as that contained in this bill ought not
to take so long.
Mr. CAMERON. If the Senator from Ohio
will allow me, I will amend his motion by say-
ing that we take the final question on Monday.
I think we ought not to meet to-morrow.
Every Senator here has a great deal of business
of a private nature and a great deal of a public
nature for his constituents to transact at the
Departments, and we ought to have Saturday
to devote to that sort of business.
Mr. SHERM AN. I am perfectly willing to
accept the suggestion of the Senator Irom
Pennsylvania if the time is fixed when this
question shall be disposed of.
Mr. CAMERON. Threeo'clockonMonday.
Mr. SHERMAN. Very well; I am willing
to say Monday at three o'clock.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to the proposition that the vote shall be
taken on this bill at three o'clock on Monday
next ?
Mr. EDMUNDS. I object for the same
reason that I did before.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not think there will
be any trouble about that.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I do not think there will
be; but I do not wish to bind myself in ad-
vance.
Mr. CONKLING. Allow me to suggest to
the Senator from Ohio, in lieu of sucfi. an un-
derstanding as this, that when the considera-
tion of the currency bill shall be proceeded
with not io give way again until it is concluded.
Mr. SHERMAN. That would be the rule
anyway. A majority of the Senate could do
that.
Mr. CONKLING. That would be the rule
anyway if it were enforced, but the Senator
by his own consent lost the benefit of the rule
on this day. lsuggesttohim not to lose it again,
but to hold on to the currency bill until we com-
plete that measure. In that view, it seems to
me it is not so very important to fix a partic-
ular hour when we shall vote. This is not a
bill likely to be debated for political reasons or
for unnecessary reasons; and if anything is to
be debated thoroughly, perhaps it is just as well
that this bill should be among those bills thor-
oughly considered.
adjournment to monday.
Mr. CAMERON. Now, as the Senator from
Ohio has the floor, and by his indulgence, !
move that when the Senate adjourns to-day it
be to meet again on Monday next at twelve
o'clock.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I hope not.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to the Chair entertaining the motion that
when the Senate adjourns to-day it be to meet,
on Monday next? The Chair hears no objec-
tion, and the question is on the motion of the
Senator from Pennsylvania.
The motion was agreed to; there being, on a
divisionâ€”ayes 39, noes 13.
executive session.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question
recurs on the motion of the Senator from Mis-
souri, [Mr. Drake,] that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of executive business.
The motion was agreed to; and after some
time spent in the consideration of executive
business the doors were reopened, and the
Senate adjourned.

Mr. WOOD. I rise to a privileged motion.
I move that when the House adjourns to-day it

Mr. SCOFIELD. I have been requested by
several members to ask that there be a session
of the House to-morrow for debate only.
Mr. WOOD. I will accept that suggestion,
and move that the session of to-morrow be for
debate only, as in Committee of the Whole,
with the understanding that no business shall
be transacted.
The SPEAKER. That will require unani-
mous consent.

which the order was made for the session of
to-morrow; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
