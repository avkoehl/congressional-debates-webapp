HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., May 19, 1864.

Brigadier General H. PRINCE,

Commanding District of Columbus:

GENERAL: I have reports that seem reliable that Forrest, having recruited his forces down at Tupelo, is returning north of WEST Tennessee, and I have reason to think that a portion of his forces is now north of the Hatchie. He probably intends to cross the Tennessee, and go into Middle Tennessee and Kentucky, on a thieving expedition, and to break up Sherman's connections. See Captain Pennock and have him patrol the river from Clifton to Eastport. The river should be closely watched from Eastport well down.

Truly, yours,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

Captain B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville, Tenn.:

I learned yesterday of a party of guerrillas in camp on the north side of the Cumberland, near Rough and Ready Furnace, commanded by one Hines. I sent forty men after them, but finding they outnumbered us, having over 100 men, did not attack them. Killed 1 of their pickets and returned. I will send out more force to-morrow.

Colonel Eighty-THIRD Illinois Volunteer Infantry, Commanding Post.

LEXINGTON, KY., May 20, 1864.

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Comdy. Army of the Ohio, in the Field, near Dalton, Ga.:

General Sherman informs me that a dispatch from General Crook of 14th instant states that Morgan is making preparations for a raid in this State through Pound Gap, and directs me to organize an expedition to meet him at once. This will take all my mounted force. All the old troops have been sent to the front. I can learn nothing of the 5,000 new troops I was to have in their place. I have called upon the Governor for four regiments of militia.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
