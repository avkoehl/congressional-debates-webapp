United States What is and has been the national
policy of Great Britain'' Why, Mr, tj talk of
glory and to figat for gam—and surely thtre is
nothing in this country wh ch can exe te her
cupidity, which would pay the cost of tak-
ing. What must be the inevitable, to say no'hi ig
df the probable, consequences of such a war1
Sir, put down the ce tain an 1 immediate loss
of her Nordi American Colonies—the destruc-
tion of her manuractures, by cutting off th"
supply of the raw material which gives h/r opt ra-
tives em ploy m , ihe de'-tt action of the best mar-
ket for her manufactured articUs, add to this, that
she suspends, perhaps extinguishes, a debt due to
htr citwns, it is síid, oí some two hundred mil-
lion's of dollar Besides, sir, has she no unsettkd
questions with her European neighbor4, or, if thtre
are none, may they not be raised when her neigh-
bors think a favorable opportunity occu's for a suc-
cessful negotiation1 Is not France almost "sick of
a calm?" is she not her "natural enemy!" an! does
she not now possess the abundant means, as she t ver
has had the inclination, for an encounter wi h Eng
land' Has not Russia, in her eastern progress, alrea-
dy reached the confines of the British possessions1
But, aside from all thete collateral cons d rations,
what can England gam by a war with ns1 No-
thing, sir, nothing The utmost she can do is, ihe
deslructioa, perhaps, at the onset, of some maritime
towns, which would not weaken ©ur ability by the
strength of a smg'e m<in, or the valut. of a single
dollar, as to conquering a foot < f American soil,
no man in his senses ever thinks of it Sir, said
Mr F I h^ve but glan ed a a fe v of the conside-
rations which, in my opinion, show that we are m
no dangf r of a war with Euri pe , and ad
these ¡hings she know , <s well as we do,
she knows our strength and our resources, she
knoc s that a war begun is not to be ended ¡n a
day, she has had a "taste of our gifts" in  he In-
volution, and again in the iast war, and with in the
last few years, she has seen a specimen of the
stuff of which American iri'na are composeJ,
which will not suffer by a comparison with Bunl er
Hill or the San Jacio o I allu le to ihat most ui-
fortunale occurrenc , the battle af Windmill Point
Let me add, Mi P con mned, that in my opi-
nion there is not, anj has not been, any cause
for collision between ihe two countries The cor-
respondence between the two Govern t ts on the
questions at ssue, which has b en carried on both
here and at London, is, in my opinion, m all re-
spects creditable to the present Administration
And notwithstand ng tne edium which a reckless
parly has sought to help upon the Executive for
pusillanimity,lor cowering before the Britisn lion, I
was pleased to hear mj honorable colleague, [Vir
Granger ] but a day or two ago, express his appro-
bation ot the negotiati n^ as cordacted by this Go-
vernment Oa th s subject all has been done which
the honor ot the com iry'required, and I shall oe

Again, it is argued that the report of the Commit-
tee on Foreign Affafs, lately made to the Ilon-e, is
calculated to produce dissatisfaction on the part o'
the English Government 1 have read thatrepmt,
and I approve of it—it -peaks out boldly in terms
worthy of the nation, and will, I doubt not, find a
hearty response in the bosom ef every patriot m
the country, and especially among those on the
Northern frontier, who feel the detpeat interest in
the questions discussed in that report The Ian
guage ot that report, said Mr F falls far behind
in spirit and force, the language of the public press
on the frontier, where the public mind has been
most excited on this subject True it is, sir, thht
much of that excitement has been created by poli i
cal demagogues for t'^e basest party purpose , and
when the debate took place here on ihe mo' on to

the recent election as it it had not taken place
Tne people were told that the expensus of ihe Go-
vernment were too great, and if the gentlemen of
the successful party have forgotten the podges of
reirenchmtnt i'iey male before the election, I have
not, and Í assure them that so far as my vo e is
oncerned, both in this Congre s a"d the next,

Mr. JONLS < f Virginia observed ihat afttr the
able speech of the gentleman who had preceded
him, it would be ard'y nee. sbaiy for him to say a
word He would, neveitheles , submit a lew fac s
by way of correcting the erroneous impression
which was likely te be ma ie on the publie. mind,
by the rema, is ut gendemen who considered the
navy had been neglec ed A ter notic ng tne va-
rious ant1 contradictory statements whicn had been
given by members ot the Opposition m i elation to
theconhtioa of our navy, Mr J re erred to au
thentiC documents to show wha' was tne acivul
condition ot that branch of the public defence, and
that it was not m the ' rumous and dilapidated"
eordi'ion as was represented
Mr J then read from official documents to show
tqat ' <• had now twcsty-jix ves e s m cemmi sion,
ard that th"e tweiit)-six wtie so arranged as to
afford an effec ual protection to the commerce of
the country
Af'ei showing the great and gradual n crease of
the na^y for the la t fifteen years, Mr   J  sari he
referred te those facts to show ihat much, had been
done lo s rengthen this aim of our national defence,
and tbat a larger am^urt of money had been ap
prrpnated than was thought neces«ary to  be used
He lh n called attention to thepreparauon  mad
by the Navy   Department ¡>o a    to put   it m ihe

Gentlemen appeared to have lost sight of the fact
that contra ts nad been en ere 1 into by the Depart
nient for frame limbers ol a g t&t number of  ves
«e's, vh eh frame -ti ?ibers were .easoning and Le

pended to the report, it would be seen that ctntracts

15 ships of the line,

besides copper, iron, &c
Here, ihcn, was the woo i eason ng and being
prepared in a proper shape, ready for putting toge

Mr J then read from the report to chow wh^t
number of the above weie actually comple'e and
rcquued nothing more than putt ng together Thi

last ten years, would exhibit a st?te of pieparauou

Mr PICKENS said it was ), s mtenticn to vo e
in the fir t instance for the amendment f the gen
ileman from Virginia [Mr Mallory] and tn°n to
have voted against he amendment of the gentle-
man from Massaohasett*, [Mr Saltonstai l,] as
amended He had intended to do that because, at
tin* time, he felt it his duty to j,5 agairst ali fur
ther appropriation a than $1,425,000, a1? reported in
the bill
The CHAIR on erved that there was but one
amerdment t en pending, that o the gentleman
from Virg ma, h vmg been accepted by the gentle-
man from Massachusetts, as a modification
Mr PICKENS said he would ih n vo e again t
the whwle proposition to amend, ao he considered
$1 400 000 amply sufficient for all piaciiwl pur
poses, at the present time He protes.ed ag^m t
an> act on hem,  had with a view to a contingency,
Oi arj legislation b<nng based on the expeclatrn
of a war tf bat «e e the real aspect of thug
the su"i pi- po rd b> ihe anumireijt would b a
mere hágate e, instead of «jtoh a pa'lty amount,
they would «ant milkons, ar i he, m such a sta'e
of *h.ngs, would be ready to vote for ttn millions,
ni
instead of $1 425,000 But, at present, he did not
desire any thing to be done which looked towards
war    There was no necessity for it.
Mr J went on to say that when the proper time
should arrive for a revision of the tariff, he then
would p'ed 'e himself to go with gentlemen of the"
Worth for such a tax as should be amply sufficient
for every want of the country. But let gentlemen
want unul the time should arrive, for he protested
against this legislation by piecemeal At this late
period of the session, now that four days only re-
mained, we were not prepared to do justice to the
subject referred to by the mover of the amendment
But if any thing should occur, which might lead to
a war, he trusted that an extra session would be
called, and that then, when the case should actually
exist, they would act 1 ke a free people But at
present he would raise his voice against any le-
gislation looking towards a war
Mr. HI WES, after some remarks, offered the
following amendment
"Provided, That the Secretary of the Navy may, if
he may deem it expedient, disburse two hundred thou-
sand dollars of sa d sum in the construction of two
steam ships of such size as will pass the outer bar
of the Mississippi, °aid ships to be built at Cincin-
nat, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky, and «aid
steam hips to he built by contract, or otherwise,
as said Secretary may order "
Atter some remarks from Messrs. WICK,
PROFFIT, and SMITH of Indiana,
The amendment was then m dified at the sugges-
tion of Mews GRAVES, W. C JOHNSON, and
PROFFIT, as fJlows
' Pnvided, That the Secretary of the Navy may,
if he may deem it expedí nt, disburse two hundred
thousand d illars of said sum in the construction ot
two st am snips of such siz° a? will pass the outer

cim ati O li >, at Louisville, Kentucky, or Cov ng-

On o or Mi sissippi rivers, if he believes the public
service will thereby be promoted, said steamships
to be built by contract or otherwise, as the «aid Se-
cretary may order "
After some remarks by  Messrs   WM. COST
JOHNSON, PROFFIT, THOMPSON of Musis
sippi, MALLORY, W THOMPSON, GRAVES,
and BRECKENR1DGE,
The question was >aken on the amendment, and
disagreed to
Mr. FILLMORE submitted the following amend
ment
"And in case the Government of Great Butam
si ill build any naval armaments for any of the
akus er rivers separa mg ihe United S ates from
the Cana las, t'.en it shall be me duty of this Go-
vernment to ouild vessel  on our side of at least a
corresponding size, and so much of the money
hereby appropriated as may be necessary, shall be
applied to that object "
The CHAIR ruled the amendment out of Older.
Mr RIVES submitted the following, which was
ploo ru'ed out of order
"Piovided, however, That the Secretary of the
T easury shall have authority to employ ap amount
out of said mm, not exceeding f 10,000, in testing
the utility of the inventions of Messrs Hunter and
Hobdy for propelling steam vessels "
The question was then taken on the amendment
of Mr Saltohstall, as modified by Mr. Mílloby,
as follow
' For increase, repair, armament, aad equipment
of the navy, and wear and tear of vessels in com-
mts ion, $2 000 000, |500,000 of which =um shall
be expended m building and equipping war steamers
of medium «ize," and decided in the negative—

The item "for medicines and surgical mstru-
men s, hospita' stores, and other expenses on ac-
cou it of the sick «30,000," having been read,
Mr UNDERWOOD moired to amend the item,
by adding
"For paj'inent of debts contracted in tre pur-
«-'la e oí si es tor the ere-t on of ma me hospita'p,
