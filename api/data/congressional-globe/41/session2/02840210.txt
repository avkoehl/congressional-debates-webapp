The Tariff—Mr. Kelley.
41st Cons....2d Sess.
identical with those we have heard from so
many gentlemen—reduced duties on coal, salt,
hides, lumber, iron, and woolen goods.
This is the burden and refrain of all the sweet
singers trained in the musical academy of D,
A. Wells, Commissioner of Revenue, and let
us right here test its merit. Lower the duties
on coal, salt, lumber, hides, iron, and woolen
goods. Well, how will this increase the num-
ber of consumers of American grain or dimin-
ish the number of grain-growers? There are
more than 1,500,000 of our pe<tple engaged in
or dependent on the labor of producing these
articles. "What will become of them ? They
cannot live on "rye and potatoes," as German
workmen in the same trades do. They will
not even be content to get meat once a week,
as the workmen of England are ; and if they
be not work must stop. And I ask gentle-
men from the grain country what they suppose
these people will do with themselves wheu the
fire has gone out in the forge and furnace, and
the loom and spindle stand still, and the salt-
kettle rusts, and there is no work in the coal
mine because the manufactures that made a
market for it have been transferred to foreign
countries in which wages are low and where the
"working people live on rye and potatoes."
Thank God, we cannot doom them to this
fate. The homestead law is their protection.
In a cabin on 120 acres of public land they
can raise wheat, potatoes, and a few sheep and
pigs; the old-fashioned spinning-wheel and
loom, easily made by skilled mechanics, will
convert their home-grown wool into fabrics,
and they can thus live till wiser legislators suc-
ceed us and reanimate the general industries
of the country by restoring the protective sys-
tem now in force.
is that the remedy? Is free trade a specific
for all or any of our ills? No, sir, it is sheer
quackery, charlatanism. Hie only euro, the
evil of which western grain-growers complain,
is i.o increase the number of consumers and
decrease the number of growers of wheat; raise,
if possible, the wages of workmen so as to make
mechanical employments attractive ; say to the
farmers' sons, " There is work and good wages
for you in the machine-shop, the forge, the fur-
nace, or the millsay to the men whose capital
is unproductive on farms, "Build mills, sink
shafts to the coal-bed which underlies your
farm; avail yourselvesof the limestone quarry
and the ore-bed, whether of iron, lead, copper,
zinc, or nickel; employ your industry and cap-
ital so that it shall be profitable to you, your
country, and mankind;" and in a little while
you will cheapen iron and steel and make an
adequate market for all the grain of the coun-
try. The gentleman's remedy is the theory of
the homeopathic physician, that like cures like,
which though it may be correct in physics, is
not an approved maxim in social science.
Mr. ALLISON. I would like the gentleman
to state how long it will bo before that happy
period will arrive?
Mr. KELLEY. Well, sir, I cannot tell
exactly. It will depend upon the degree of
promptness with which the remedy is applied.
Jiut it the Clerk will do me the kindness to give
me a little rest by reading a letter from an Irish
patriot, one who knew England's tenderness for
her laboring people experimentally at home in
Ireland^ and who laid one of his limbs away in
the service of our country during the war, and
now lives in Quincy, Illinois, I will endeavor to
give the gentleman some idea.
The Clerk read as follows:
"We have a population of 35,000 or 40,000, and our
citizens arc just commcncing to awake to the neces-
sity of cncouragiug local manufacturing. We have
2 paper mills, 10 flour mills, 5tobacco factories; sales
53,.JUO,OOU; 9 machine-shops; sales $1,050,000; 5 ma-
chine foundenos; 4 *tove foundcries turned out last
year 36,400 stoves, amounting to $473,200 cash sales-
2 boilcri-hopy, tumiug <>ut$210,000 per year; 15 wagon
and plow shops, with a capital of $200,000; 4 planing
nulls, capital $I8u,<J0O; 14 manufacturers of saddles
andharness,capital $233,400; andnumerousotherstoo
tedious to mention. There is a company at present
engaged in boring for coal, with fine prospects of suc-
cess. If we can only get coal here manufacturing
•will spring up all around tis. I have thought some
of organizing a stock company to build factories and
supply funds to encourage skilled workmen to enter
into what is called tho cooperative system. I shall
shortly test the matter to see if it can bo made to
work.
" If the friends of protection can hold their own
till after the taking of the census the crisis will be
passed, for that will show such progress in the mate-
rial wealth of the nation that it will require a bold
man indeed to attack our system of labor. It is use-
less for us to talk of competing with England while
she keeps as many of her people in her poor-houses
as she docs in her public schools—a country that
expends seven eighths more to keep up her poor-
houses than she does to support her schools. Eng-
land and Scotland have a population of 24,599,277,
for the education of which sho has 14,591 schools,
with 12,832 teachers, costing annually $4,212,500,
while^sho expends for her poor-houses annually
#32,595,000. Compare her with Illinois, a State sixty
years ago in possession of tho savages, but now pos-
sessing a population of about 2,500,000, with 11,000
schools and 20,000 teaehcrs, costing $0,500,000 an-
nually, more than 50 per cent, greater than England,
with a population ten times larger than us. The
free-trader says that pauperism is growing «less in
England under her free-trade system; but I find,
from Purdy's lleport in 1866, she had 842,860; and 1
see by the American Cyclopedia of 1808 for that year
1,034,832 paupers are reported. These are facts for
the American people to profit by. It is reported
that there aronowin London more than 80,000skilled
workmen outof employment. We hear much about
English liberty, but I have been of the opinion that
tho kind of liberty they are enjoying is that tho wolf
accords the lamb or tho strong toward the weak in
all nations—a liberty which, I trust, will never lind
a place among our institutions.
'' The sympathizers or advocates of this English sys-
tem say that free trade will give us a market for our
surplus produco in Europe, liut 1 find the more we
ship tho less wo lcceivc. In 1808 wo exported to
England 4,414,230 hundred weight of wheat, receiv-
ing therefor ^17,952,850; in 1869, for the same period,
7,938,818 hundred weight, receiving therefrom only
$17,710,770, or $211,000 less than we received for half
the amount tho previous year. If we were to change
our policy, and instead of sending our wheat to Ei£g-
laud induce those 80,000 skilled workmen to come to
us we would not then be compelled to look to Eng-
land for a market. They will be compelled to come
to us for our cotton and tobacco; but there is no
need of us going to them for manufactured goods.
We can take their surplus labor, transfer it to this
country, and ultimately tend to tho welfare of both,
and thereby accomplish more than the sentimental
philanthropists of Europe and America can ever do
by preaching "free trade." We are influenced too
much by the political economists of Europe, who
write to tickle the fancy of the wealthy few, without
any regard to tho rights of the laboring millions."
Mr. KELLEY. I desire in this connection,
and before turning to other topics, to present a
brief extract from a speech made in the United
States Senate by the experienced merchant and
enlightened statesman who represents New
Jersey in that body, Hon. Alexander G-. Cat-
tell. In the course of Lis remarks on the 22d
of January, 1867, he said:
"But, Mr. President, the harmony of interests
which exists between agriculture and manufactures,
and the truth of the positionl have taken, are clearly
shown by actual results. I am s>ure the Senate will
excuse me if I draw an illustration from personal
observation in my own mercantile life. Twenty
years ago last autumn I embarked in the trade in
breadstuff's in the city of Philadelphia. At that time,
and for some succeeding years, the entire volume of
my business was made up of consignments of agri-
cultural products from the valleys of the Susque-
hanna, tho Juniata, and the Lehigh. I have not the
figures at command, but I am sure I speak within
bounds when I say that my own house and the four
or live others doing business from the same points
must have received from this quarter 4,000,000 to
5,000,000 bushels of cereals per annum. Philadelphia
is still the natural market for the surplus product
of this territory, but for some years past there have
not been consignments enough received from that
entire section to realize commissions sufficient to pay
the salary of a receiving clerk.
"Do you ask, has production fallen off? I answer,
no; on the contrary, it has increased, but the whole
line of these valleys has been dotted with furnaces
and forges and rolling-mills and saw-mills and fac-
tories and workshops, filled with operatives, and the
consumer of agricultural products has been brought
to the farmer's doors. lie now finds a readier mar-
ket for his products at home at prices equal to those
ruling on the sea-board, of which he avails himself
and thus saves all the cost of transportation and fac-
torage, equal at average prices to about 20 per cent.
Nay, more, sir, my own firm has frequently within
the past few years sold and shipped to the millers in
one of these valleys, that in which the iron interest
has been most developed, the Lehigh, wheat drawn
from Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, andlowatosup-
ply the deficiency in the consumptive want. And
these products of the prairies of the West were sold,
too, at a price far in excess of what could have been
realized by exportation to any country on thefaco
of the globe. As aconsequenceofthisstateof things
land has risen in value through all this section, and
farms that could have been boughtfifteen or twenty
years ago at §40 or $50 per acre are now salable at
$150 or $200 per acre. Villages have grown to be
towns, and towns havo grown to be cities, agriculture
and manufactures have clasped hands and prosperity
reigns."
protection stimulates immigration.
Sir, the gentleman from Iowa asked how
long it would take if we shut up our machine-
shops and mills, and closed our coal-mines, to
turn 100,000 men into agriculturists. It would
take one season.
Mr. ALLISON. Oh no ; that was not my
question.
Mr. KELLEY. That was what I was stating
when you interrupted me.
Mr. ALLISON. I wanted to know how long
it would be before iron and steel would be pro-
duced at a cheaper rate than it is now imported.
That was my question.
Mr. KELLEY. I do not think I said cheaper
lhau il is now imported, but cheaper than it
can then be imported. As the price goes down
here it is going up in England; and under the
present duty we will soon be able to supply
our own demand, and meet England in com-
mon markets at equal prices. Sir, I want to
show gentlemen from the West what effect
the tariff has on immigration. I have before
me the tariffs from the organization of the Gov-
ernment down to the present time, given in ad
valorem percentages, and a statement of the
number of immigrants that arrived in each
year, from 1856 to 1869 inclusive. By com-
paring them I find that whenever our duties
have been low immigration fell off, and when-
ever our duties have been high the volume of
immigration increased. This seems to be a
fixed law.
Both papers are taken from the immaculate
report of David A. Wells, Special Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue, and I therefore
present them with some hesitancy, and with
the remark that if they are incorrect it is not
my fault.
I find by these tables that in the nine years
from 185G to 18G4, inclusive, we received
1,403,407 immigrants; and in the four years
of the protective tariff, of which so many
gentlemen from the West whose States are
not overcrowded complain, we have received
1,514,810, or over 111,000 more in the four
years of protection than in the nine preceding
years of free trade and low tariff. But I had
better let the statement speak for itself. In
introducing it Mr. Wells says:
"The following is a revised and tho most accurate
attainable statement of tho course of alien immigra-
tion into tho United States sinco and including the
year 1856:
185 6  200,430
185 7  2-51,300
185 8  123,120
185 9  121,282
186 0  1-3.:,040
186 1  91,920
186 2  91,987
186 3  176,282
186 4  193.418
186 5  248,120
186 6  318,554
186 7  298,358
186 8  297,215
186 9  352,569
Total in fourteen years 2,918,213
"Totalfrom July 1, 1865,to June~30,1869, five years,
1,514.816."
In 1856 the rate of duty on the aggregate of
our imports was 20.3, and the number of immi-
grants were 200,486 j in 1859 the rate of duties
had been reduced to 14.0, and the number of
immigrants fell to 121,282. In 1861, by the
acts of March 2, August 5, and December 24 the
rate of duties was furtherreduced to 11.2. This
broke the camel's back. So many men were
