OFFICE ASST. AGENT FOR EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS, FLAG-OF-TRUCE STEAMER NEW YORK,

Charleston Harbor, December 7, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commissioner for Exchange, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that in consequence of General Sherman's operations in Georgia the Confederate authorities were compelled to abandon the further delivery of our prisoners to me in Savannah River. They so notified me, whereupon I made proposition for the continuance of the business in Charleston Harbor. General Hardee, commanding at Charleston, gave his consent. I then visited Major-General Foster and Admiral Dahlgren and received from each authority to arrange a truce for this purpose. I accordingly on Sunday, 4th instant, had an interview with the enemy and arranged that firing on the city and works in and about the harbor should be suspended for a limited period for the transferring prisoners of war to my vessels. It is provided in the agreement that no labor shall be performed by either party on works, forts, batteries, or military defenses embraced within the limits of this agreement. It is also provided that this truce shall in no way affect the blockade of the port of Charleston, S. C., by the United States. Our military and naval forces are in no degree restricted from attacking, capturing, or destroying any vessels or boats entering or leaving the enemy's lines. I have already received 1,000 men by and under the new arrangement and except to finish this week if the weather will permit.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO E. MULFORD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and U. S. Assistant Agent for Exchange.

SIR: The U. S. Christian Commission of the city of Philadelphia having expressed its desire to send a suitable number of unexceptionable delegates of the commission with stores and publications to visit and minister to the Union prisoners in Southern prisons with efficient relief and benefit, and Lieutenant-General Grant having approved the plan, permission is hereby granted to the commission to send a number of good Christian men for the object proposed, whose named and residences and the points to which it is proposed to send them will first be communicated to the Adjutant-General of the Army at Washington.

In return, authority will be granted, if desired, on application to Lieutenant-General Grant, to proper Christian agents of the South to visit and administer to prisoners taken in arms against the United States and held in our prisons.

I am, sir, &c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
