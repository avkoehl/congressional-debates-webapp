By command of Major-General Steedman:

S. B. MOE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BRIDGEPORT, January 14, 1865-2.30 p.m.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

Just returned from below. The fleet has captured in all about 15 prisoners, 30 horses and saddles, and a lot of arms. The rebels thoroughly disorganized, and a very small cavalry force could pick up the whole command. General Cruft has withdrawn his force, and now the rebels can wait their leisure about crossing. I keep my vessels there still, but the people in the neighborhood conceal the rebels.

M. FORREST,

Commanding Eleventh District, Mississippi Squadron.

CLEVELAND, January 14, 1865.

Major S. B. MOE,

A reliable citizen reports that about 100 mounted guerrillas crossed the railroad at Varnell's Station this morning at 11 o'clock. They were going toward Chattanooga.
