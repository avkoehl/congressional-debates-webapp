General JOHN E. SMITH,

Resaca:

I have your dispatch of 12 m. and Colonel Raum's of 10.30 a. m.

You should make a junction with the Dalton force as soon as possible, restore the telegraph and railroad, and feel out to Spring Place. If Wheeler goes up into East Tennessee, well; only get word to Chattanooga and Nashville as soon as possible; I would rather he was there than here. Do all you can to rescue his prisoners, and don't let him return. Get on the road by which he went and obstructed by all the mans in your power. It may be he has gone up into East Tennessee with a part, and a part remains; in that event fall upon the latter and drive it as far as your man have endurance. Clean out Spring Place, move its inhabitants north and burn the town, if you think they have connived or played spies on our road. Communicate these views to General Steedman and I will approve whatever you or he amy do.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.

General JOHN E. SMITH,

Resaca:

I hear nothing of the six regiments near Cartersville. The wire was interrupted for some hours, but now is working well. If Martin should be attacked by infantry, and the road occupied and obstructed by all possible ways, so that he cannot move artillery or wagons. As soon as you communicate with General Steedman, and he is satisfied he can handle Wheeler, return to your post with the command. The stores in Allatoona are so valuable that I don't want to risk them too much. Wheeler's move north was forced upon him, and if he could be hemmed in he won't fight hard. He depends on sudden dashes and surprise. I have broken the West Point road good, and will try the Macon road, without which Hood cannot feed his army. Wheeler will find it hard to feed his men and horses up three. General Steedman can call from above a good many troops, and horses will be along soon.

General JOHN E. SMITH,

Resaca:

I do not think you should attack Wheeler in position with your force. Better wait till you act in concert with General Steedman, who can bring to Dalton from the rear a good force that can do the thing sure
