SATURDAY, April 20, 1861-11 o'clock.

[General SCOTT:]

Have just heard that the bridges between Ashland and Cockeysville and two or three nearer town are burned. Will advise the forces in Philadelphia and such as may be at Harrisburg to come upon this road as far as they can and protect the balance of the road and protect while temporarily repairing the bridges or so much as is necessary-the balance to come in force and well armed to within three miles of Baltimore and cross over to Washington [branch], and if in our possession as it should be to proceed by rail to Washington; if not to march by forced marches to Washington. * * *

Yours,

D. WILMOT.

HAGERSTOWN, April 22, 1861.

Governor T. H. HICKS, Annapolis:

Virginia troops searching houses in Maryland on Saturday near Harper's Ferry for arms. I appealed to General Harper, commander, to recall them which he prmised if Northern troops are forbidden. What is to be done with Southern? What steps shall I take?

EDWARD M. MOBLEY,

Sheriff of Washington County.

PHILADELPHIA, April 23, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: Since I wrote my last of this date I have been informed that the Baltimoreans and Marylanders have destroyed the whole of the bridges on the Northern Central. This seems to have been a mere spite action and must convince the Government that those loayl to the Government in Maryland are in a vast minority. As soon as the capital is safe from attack it seems to me that the Government should at once turn on Baltimore and place it under martial law and require that it should pay all damages to the railroads it has destroyed and to their business.

Yours, truly,

J. EDGAR THOMSON,

President Pennsylvania Central Railroad.
