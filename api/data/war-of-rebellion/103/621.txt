HDQRS. DIST. OF SOUTHWEST MISS. AND EAST LA.,January 20, 1865.

It having come to the knowledge of the general commanding the district that permits to transport cotton have been surreptitiously used, purporting to be by my authority, notice is hereby given that all such permits are false and unauthorized, and that no permits are to be respected unless signed by myself and accompanied by the certificate of F. H. Hatch, collector of customs, that the export duties have been paid. The certificate of the latter is in all cases indispensable. All officers, soldiers, and scouts are hereby ordered to arrest all parties moving cotton in violation of this order, together with the cotton, teams, and drivers, and report the same to these headquarters.

GEO. B. HODGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

DISTRICT OF WEST FLORIDA AND SOUTH ALABAMA,

East Pascagoula, January 31, 1865 - 11.30 p. m.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the last of my troops are just embarking for Mobile Bay. We have been unavoidably detained for two days because of the extremely low tides and fog, and the stranding of two of our best boats. I have succeeded in getting off both the Zephyr and Swaim, and have nothing behind. The Eighty-third Ohio passed here for Pensacola at 4 p. m. to-day. All the transports will be returned to Lakeport and New Orleans to-morrow. General Andrews' troops are all concentrated in Pensacola, leaving Bertram's brigade in Mobile Bay.

Very respectfully,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.
