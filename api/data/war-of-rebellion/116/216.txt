Major General JOHN E. WOOL, U. S. Army,

Commanding Department of Virginia, Fort Monroe, Va.

SIR: The General-in-Chief desires you to propose the exchange of Lieutenant Colonel William A. Nichols (a major when taken) and Captain Frederick E. Prime for some prisoners of like rank in our hands. The former officer is on parole; the latter is still a prisoner. The Rev. F. V. Hoskins who was taken prisoner at Hatteras has been informed that he may proceed to Norfolk via Fort Monroe on parole, to return within thirty days unless he shall effect the release of Rev. Hiram Eddy, chaplain of a Connecticut regiment, who was taken prisoner at the battle of Bull Run.

I am, sir, &c.,

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
