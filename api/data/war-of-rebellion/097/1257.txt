WASHINGTON, June 6, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I would recommend that all enlistments for the Veteran Reserve Corps be discontinued. Transfers from the volunteer service of men desiring to go into that corps and who are unfit for active service, should be the only increase allowed in my judgment.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General
