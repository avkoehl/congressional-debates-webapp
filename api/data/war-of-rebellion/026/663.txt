I have taken pains to apprise the military authorities of the insufficiency of these means to the ends proposed and urged by them.

Lieutenant Cushing and Lamson are still in the Nansemond and still under instruction to give all the assistance in their power to the army. The orders which I have given Lieutenant Lamson not only do not restrain but direct his going into the Upper Nansemond when necessary and practicable at his discretion.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Actg. Rear-Admiral, Commanding N. Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 28, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Admiral Lee has withdrawn all his gunboats from the Upper Nansemond, against my remonstrance and General Peck's, leaving us to take care of ourselves. We had two unarmed transports at Suffolk, which were much wanted, and yesterday I ordered them down. Two of our officers, who have been commanding on a gunboat I armed myself, volunteered to pilot them, and they have this morning performed the service successfully. Both boats received some cannon-shot and a good many rifle-balls, but that we expected. Neither sustained any injury worth mentioning, though they were fired on by three batteries and from a good many rifle-pits. I have just received the following dispatch from General Peck, from which you will see that the enemy is in earnest:

SUFFOLK, VA., April 28, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX:

The force reported by Stratton on the Chowan was Garnett's six regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and some artillery, which has joined Longstreet. Garnett commanded at Little Washington. The enemy were very active all night, and we kept several batteries in play on chopping parties. General Getty reported movement of troops down the river with artillery, indicative of crossing.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

April 28, 1863-9.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have been on the Nansemond to-day. No movements there. General Garnett's brigade, from North Carolina, has joined Longstreet. Two heavy guns, drawn each by 10 horses, passed through Surry County to Suffolk on Tuesday evening, reaching there yesterday. We shall no doubt soon hear from them.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 28, 1863.

General DIX:

The enemy opened a new battery with three guns on the river last night. Lieutenant Rowe deserves great credit for his exploit. When will the guns we talked about be sent?

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
