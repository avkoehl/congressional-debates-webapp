tion, and am constructing works rapidly to guard against an attack. I believe I am safe. One brigade of infantry was sent out yesterday to Iuka. Found the enemy had passed that point, and it is generally believed that Hood has let Corinth and gone south to Okolona or Columbus. By to morrow night my position will be so strong as to defy his whole force. I regret I have no cavalry, or I would be able to send you a more definite report. I occupy all the ground at Eastport; no other corps can possibly land here. Just above Big Bear Creek, at Chickasaw, you will find an excellent camp for one corps, and bridges can easily be constructed to communicate with us. Wilson has not yet arrived. I detained one boat to bring over some cavalry just reported. I send two transports and barges to Clifton to bring up my artillery; the remainder of the fleet go to Savannah to bring up my transportation.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General.
