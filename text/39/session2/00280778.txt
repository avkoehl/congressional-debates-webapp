screws and improved machinery for drawing
screw-heads, for the, benefit of the heirs of
Thomas W. Harvey, the inventor and patentee
of the same.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. I would ask the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Bromwell] if
these patents have not been extended once
already ?
Mr. BROMWELL. They-have.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. Then I hope they
will not be extended again.
Mr. BROMWELL. I will give to those
gentlemen who desire to say anything in op-
position to this bill the greater part of the
time I shall be entitled to, after the previous
question shall have been seconded, which I
propose to call.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will suggest to
the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Bromwell]
that even should the call for the previous ques-
tion be sustained, a motion to lay the bill on
the table would have the priority, and the gen-
tleman might be prevented from saying any-
thing on the bill.
Mr. BROMWELL. Then I will not call the
previous question, but will proceed to state
briefly the facts in this case. It is true, this
inventor has had his patents for twenty-one
years. But the nature of the inventions is
such that many years must necessarily have
elapsed in bringing the business under the
patents into such a condition that any emol-
uments could be derived from them. The ex-
pense of setting up that business must have
been very great. One machine by itself is of
no use, but hundreds of them are necessary in
order to enable the manufacturer to fill the
commonest order. The inventions are exceed-
ingly ingenious; not the results of a lucky
thought, but evidently of long study and ex-
periment. Those inventions have revolution-
ized the mode of making screws, and have
reduced their price. There are many other
machines by which wood-screws are made
besides the machines covered by these patents
The extensions asked for by this bill relate only
. to two of a great number of patents, for the
purpose of conferring some small benefit upon
the widow and heirs of the inventor, Thomas
W. Harvey. The inventor spent a large for-
tune and many years of his life in bringing
these inventions to perfection, and when he
died he left his family not one cent remunera-
tion for them, for he had received none him
self, either from the patents themselves or the
money he had invested in putting them into
operation.
The SPEAKER. The morning hour has
expired, and the bill goes over to the next
Friday morning hour.
enrolled joint resolution signed.
Mr. COBB, from the Committee on Enrolled
Bills, reported that the committee had exam-
ined ana found truly enrolled a joint resolution
(S. R. No. 112) for the relief of Mrs. Abby
Green; when the Speaker signed the same.
message from the senate.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. McDon-
ald, its Chief Clerk, announced that the Senate

reconstruction.
Mr. ASHLEY, of Ohio. I call for the regu-
lar order. .
The SPEAKER. The first business in or-
der after the expiration of the morning hour
is the consideration of House bill No. 543, to
restore to the States lately in insurrection their
full political rights, upon which the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. RossJ is entitled to the floor.
Mr. ROSS. In view of the magnitude and
importance of the legislation proposed by the
bill now before us I have thought it my duty to
submit a few considerations to the House upon
the subject. The objections which I shall pre-
sent to this bill will be, first, that there is no
constitutional power or authority in the Con-
gress of the United States to pass such a meas-
ure as this; second, that it is in conflict with
the principles and doctrines enunciated by
the Republican party during the progress of
the war; and third, that if these objections did
not exist, it would be unwise and inexpedient
to act upon the subject in the manner proposed.
First, then, upon the question of the power
and the right of Congress to pass the bill be-
fore the House: I hold that the powers of Con-
gress are limited by the Federal Constitution;
that while the General Government is supreme
and paramount to the extent of the delegated
powers, it is equally clear that the powers not
conferred upon it are by the express terms of
the Constitution reserved to the States and the
people thereof respectively. The national Gov-
ernment has supreme authority to the extent
of its delegated powers; but those powers are
defined in the written Constitution establish-
ing the Government.
Mr. Speaker, I do not recognize the sound-
ness of the doctrines enunciated by the able
and distinguished gentleman from New York,
[Mr. Raymond,] who discussed this question
the ^pther day, that we have an unwritten Con-
stitution by which we are to be governed. I
am somewhat relieved, however, to find that
gentlemen on that side of the House are in-
clined to thus justify their action. I had
felt some apprehension that in our congres-
sional action here we might be trenching upon
the Constitution of our country. But when I
learned from the gentleman from New York
[Mr. Raymond] that all these measures which
we suspected to be infringements upon the
Constitution are to be passed under the au-
thority of an unwritten Constitution I felt
greatly relieved, at least upon that particular
point.
I do not recognize any such doctrine. The
written Constitution of our country is the guide
by which we are to be governed and controlled in
our action. I am aware that this is a doctrine
which commands but little attention in Con-
gress at the present time. But a few days ago,
when a distinguished and able member from
the State of Kentucky was discussing a consti-
tutional question, a gentleman near me said,
"Why, he must evidently be a new member;
if he had been here any length of time he
would have learned long since that no atten-
tion is paid by this Congress to the Constitu-
tion of the United States."
