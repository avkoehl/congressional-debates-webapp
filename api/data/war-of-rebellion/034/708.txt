under Captain [G. S.] Alexander, that went into Harrodsburg. They say they were cut off from Morgan by our forces. I have sent a party to look after them. I can learn of no others. They are probably trying to get out by crossing the Kentucky River.

W. P. SANDERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

LAWRENCEBURG, KY., July 8, 1863.

General HARTSUFF:

I have a party out in the vicinity of Johnsonville and Chaplin. I have also sent out in the direction of Camden and Mount Eden. Report from Captain [A. C.] Wells, at Johnsonville, says the rebels were concentrating at Bloomfield yesterday, and that they moved toward Shelbyville. I do not think it the main force of the enemy.

W. P. SANDERS,

Colonel.

4 P. M.-Everything quiet. No rebels anywhere in this vicinity that I can hear of. Rations received.

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 8, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

You will see that all the Home Guards are armed at once, and other preparations made to repel any attack which Morgan may attempt. Communicate with me frequently during the night, and keep me fully informed of any news you may hear.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

ELIZABETHTOWN, July 8, 1863.

General BOYLE:

Morgan has gone to the Ohio River. They all crossed the turnpike road between this and the river, 14 miles from here. All got over late yesterday evening. Some were near Brandenburg at 1 o'clock yesterday. This you can rely on.

S. B. THOMAS.

ELIZABETHTOWN, July 8, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE:

I arrived here half an hour ago, only twenty hours behind Morgan, notwithstanding my detention at Green River. My force is 1,200 cavalry,
