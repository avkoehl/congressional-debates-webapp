(Received 1. 20 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

From the latest reports I am pretty well convinced that the enemy do not intend crossing the river in force, or going east of the Blue Ridge. I have, therefore, ordered General Wright immediately here, to join us to-night, if possible. We shall then move with the whole command, and get in rear of the enemy, if possible; if not, we shall pursue him up the Valley.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
