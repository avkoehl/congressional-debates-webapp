Major-General KAUTZ:

The enemy's cavalry attached the picket-line of Fort Magruder this morning. General Ord wishes to know if you can cut them off. The force is supposed to be small.

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,February 11, 1865.

Brigadier-General TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

I see very little prospect of finding a small force on the peninsula, and the Chickahomity is a serious obstacle at this season to any force, in view of the fact that there are no bridges nearer than New Bridge, and it is not certain that there is one there. The distance from here to Williamsburg by that route cannot be less than eighty miles. I do not see much prospect of cutting off a small force; it would be chance work.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

General SHEPLEY,

I am instructed by General Ord to notify "commanders of boats and vessels on the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal and Chowan River that a large party has left Petersburg probably to interrupt navigation of these or neighboring waters by torpedoes or boarding vessels, and word also to General Palmer to notify vessels to be prepared for such parties." You will therefore send the above notification to all commanders of boats and vessels on the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal and Chowan River, and also to General Palmer.
