DAMAGES.

In Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew's battalion, a 12-pounder caisson was blown up, and the axle of a 20 pounder gun-carriage so much injured by a shot of the enemy as to stop the use of it for fear of dismounting it. In First Virginia Artillery, one 3-inch caisson exploded by shell from enemy; one 3-inch limber-chest shot through the front part; one well of 10-punder Parrton gun-carriage smashed; one lid of 20-pounder Parrott caisson-chest torn by shell, rendering new one necessary. In Lieutenant -Colonel Carter's battalion, one 12-pounder limberchest was damaged by shot from the enemy, so as to expose the ammunition to the weather. In Lieutenant -Colonel Carter's battalion, one 12-pounder limberchest was damaged by shot from the enemy, so as to expose the ammunition to the weather. In Lieutenant-Colonel Jones' battalion, one of the Napoleon guns of Captain [A. W.] Garber's battery was struck in the muzzle by a shot from the enemy, and thereby disabled. This gun was replaced by one captured at Gettysburg.

REMARKS.

There is complaint made by Lieutenant [William] Fontaine, ordnance officer, Jones' battalion, that the ammunition of the 3-inch (banded) gun, or navy Parrott, is mixed up with the 2, 9 -inch 10-pounder Parrott in such a way as to cause great inconvenience. Two guns were rendered unserviceable after firing 12 rounds, from the shell lodging in the bore.
