POINT LOOKOUT, April 15, 1865. (Received 8.15 a. m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

The following dispatch is just received from the scouting party in the district.

I sent Lieutenant Davis with scouting party to-day and ascertained that a party of well-armed rebel soldiers were seen on Wednesday evening, 12th instant, between Newport and Crookshanks' Store, eighteen miles form Leonardtown, twenty-seven privates and three officers. The only definite information is that they started in the direction and three officers. The only definite information is that they started in the direction of the Patuxent River. The supposition is that they have a design to capture a Chesapeake Bay steamer. There is no doubt but that there are armed bands in the district. I will be on the alert and do all I can with the forces at my disposal. Captain Buckley left with an escort in the direction of the Government farms.

S. G. WILLAUER,

Captain, Commanding.
