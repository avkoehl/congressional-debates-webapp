1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
i m
exportation it does it another way, namely, by
depreciation. This exhibits itself in a rise in
prices exactly proportioned to the quantity of
paper afloat, so that no amount uttered will in-
crease the money a dollar. In illustration of this
fact I will quote two examples. On the 36th Feb-
ruary, 1797, the Crown council resolved that the
public service required the bank "to forbear is-
suing any cash in payments." An immense ex-
citement resulted. In the midst of the turmoil a
meeting of the London merchants was held, and
it was lesolved 44 that we will not refuse to re-
ceive bank notes in payment of any sum of money
to be paid to us." Pour thousand names were
appended, and the Gentleman'sMagazine states
it never witnessed a more loyal meeting. It was
in this temper that the public received the bank
suspension. The bank continued to issue its
notes, and (he circulation rose from <£10,000,000
to <£22,500,000 in 1810, when gold was nine and
one eighth premium. In 1813 gold was thirty-
six and a half premium. The circulation of these
two periods was as follows:
1810. 1813.
Bank of England £22.5-11,000 £24,023,000
Counuy notes  21,374.000 22,3-12.000
Silver taken  4,500,000 4,500,000
Total £-IS,415,000 £50,865.000
Specie value £44,430,848 £37.30.1,000
Thus, with the larger circulation outstanding,
there was less money afloat. Now, sir, wh> t is
the fact in leiation to our own currency? The
amount of specie estimated in the northern States
in 18G1 was $200,000,000. The bank circulation
was $150,000,000. The specie has now been re-
placed with #300,000,000 of United States paper,
and gold is 100. The results are as follows:
1861. 1864.
Specie £200.0C(),000
Bank notes       155.000,000 $160,000,000
United States notes  - 469,031,294
Total circulation $355,000,000 $629,031,294
Specie value  §355.01)0,01)0 $393,143,900
The amount of money has undergone but little
increase as measured in gold; but as measured
in the price of other commodities it has not in-
creased at all. It isa principle of currency, when
depreciated, that gold demonetized will rise in price
less than other commodities, for the reason that
its greatest value consists in the use of it for cir-
culation. When Congress, by the law of Feb-
ruary, 1862, made paper a legal render, the demand
for specie as a currency ceased. The cessation
in demand caused a fall in its value, and it began
to disappear. Sliver has entirely disappeared and
gone out of the country. Gold has been in de-
mand for customs^ duties, and to some extent for
hoarding and speculation,and this has retained a
portion of it in the country. This has r.ot, how-
ever, sufficed to keep gold up to the level of other
commodities, the demand for which is gieater than
ever, pioportioned to the production of them, be-
cause the Government has taken into its employ
more than one million men who are consumeis of
goods, munitions, and produce, and of which they
create nothing. Great numbers of othersare em-
ployed in manufacturing articles for the war con-
sumption that could not be used in tune of peace.
In the paymentof all these the Government pays
out an increasing supply of paper which passes
into the hands of the people, and for which every
individual in the country demands daily and
houilysome portion of domestic and imported
articles to consume; but very few ask or care for
gold. Hence it is that gold has risen in value less
than any other article, in other words, ihe paper
of the Government has depreciated less in com-
parison with gold than with most other commodi-
ties. This is not left to surmise or conjecture,
but is susceptible of mathematical demonstration.
EFFECT OF PAPER MONEY.
The Secretary in his report lias given tables of
Crices in Nnv York for thirty-nine years, em-
racing most of the important articles of com-
merce, and lie hopes (hat they will be of service
in promoting information upon the influences
winch act upon prices. { have availed myself of
these tables in my endeavor to carry out the hope
of the honorable Secictary. A table of sixty
leading articles has been eonsh ueu d, showing the
aggregate value of the whole at regular intervals,
compared with the price at the corresponding pe-
iiod,and the amount of United Slates notes at
i the same time, according to the official reports:

These facts concentrated from the Secretary's
tables show that gold has jtdvanced to a very
trifling extent in comparison with the advance
which has taken place in the great articles of
commerce. Every one of (he sixty articles em-
braced in the table has advanced, step by step,
with the emissions of the Government paper, and
the aggregate average advance has been 116 per
cent., when gold has advanced but 52 per cent.
A portion of the advance lias been due, doubt-
less, to the laxes, to the scarcity of materials, and
to the rise in labor; but that is also due to the pa-
per currency which has compelled strikes among
work-people.
This average rise in the prices of commodities
marks the true depreciation of the Government
papei,and gives the key to the loan transactions
of the Secretary. The following shows the value
of the loans made at four periods, in goods and in
specie:
We have here the fact that in proportion as the
value of the circulating paper fell in regard to
commodities, did the desire increase to place it
in the six per cent, stock. The frightful depre-
ciation is manifest in taking a single article, and
we may select iron as one of which the supply h^s
been less influenced by the war than most others.
The price of iron in the tables of the Secretary is
#21, December, 1861. At that date he obtained for
§50,000,000 of six per cent, stock from the banks
§44,661,231 in coin, which was then equal to
2,126,776 tons of pig iron. In December, 1863* th'e
Secretary obtained $50,000,000 in paper for the
same amount of stock, and this was worth only
1,190,477 tons of iron. Thus for the samequan-
tity of stock for which the people are to pay gold,
principal and interest, the-Secretary obtains about
one half the iron. He is paying per annum in gold
$3,000,000for the use of 13190,470 tons of iron,or
§2 50 per ton, whereas he paysfl 41 per ton per
annum for the use of that bought in 1861; yet lie
coolly informs us that he is borrowing at a lower
rate of interest. This process is progressive with
every issue of paper; prices rise, and with that rise
more paper is required to effect the same object.
Now. sir, it is not a matter of surprise that the
Secretary is able to sell a gold stock on such
terms. Every business man is aware that (he
present prices are fictitious, that they depend only
upon the quantity of paper afloat, and that they
will sink lower than before when that paper per-
ishes. The man who held astock of goods more
or less dead at specie prices, suddenly finds them
converted into paper money at three or four
prices. He puts that money into six per cent,
stock, because he hopes it will be paid in gold,
and he will have purchased it at sixty cents on ft
dollar.
SIMILAR SYSTEMS ABROAD.
The history of our present paper issues is but
a repetition of the French revolutionary system-
The origin and course of the issues are very
nearly the same. France had, in the operations
of John Law, an experience quite as terrible as
our own revolutionary paper issues. That fa-
mous financier was the ablest of the times. M.
Thiers, in the French Chambers, in 1840, on the
occasion of the recharterof the Bank of France,
remarked in leiation to Law's work on finances:
"It contains all that we have been able to say since,
and I afifnmthat Law at tho beginning of the eighteenth
eentiny understood quite as much of the question as any
of those who have since discussed the subject of banking."
This is no doubt true, because I have remarked
the matter is of itself simple, but is only mysti-
fied by attempts at fraud. On the 5th May, 1716,
under the name of Law & Co., was chartered a
bunk of twelve thousand shares of about $100
each. This bank was conducted on the soundest
principles and had a great success. The general
currency were treasury notes of Louis XIV, for
which Law's notes were fifteen per cent, premium.
He issued notes, but on business paper. In an
evil hour the bank fell under the control of the
regent, who, like our Secretary in 1861, was of
opinion that if a " little paper was good more was
better," and $200,000,000 of notes were issued.
It is needless to say that the scenes that are now
developing themselves here immediately mani-
fested themselves there. The wildestspeculation
succeeded, and the whole power of the Govern-
ment soon exerted itself to maintain the credit of
the paper. Law, it appears, like our own Sec-
retary, while constantly giving hints of the dan-
ger of paper money, continually pushed the is-
fcues. in 1720 discredit set in. It was then that
the ingenuity of the Government was taxed to
put down "gold speculators," who, it asserted,
caused the depreciation of the paper, and finally,
February, 1720, an edict was issued forbidding
the use of specie altogether. Any person found
with more than $100 coin in his possession was
to pay a fine and submit to confiscation. It was
forbidden to buy specie, and informers weregiven
one half. Sir, our own gold bill before Congress
gives informers one third, but Chase is less lib-
eral than Mr. Law and the regent. The edict
gave rise to the most atrocious proceedings. Lord
Srftnir observed that it was impossible to doubt
Law's Romanism, "since he had established an
inquisition after his manifest belief in transub-
slantiat'wn by turning so much gold into paper.'''
Coin was an illegal tender. The annals of the
times are full of the distress which grew out of
Law's paper. The public patience was soon ex-
hausted, and Law was chased out of France, just
escaping with his life.
