HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864 - 9.30 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report all quiet along my line during the past twenty-four hours. Small scouting parties were sent out from each division and report the enemy from three-quarters to one mile from our picket-line. The redoubt at the Chimneys is not yet completed. The infantry parapet on right of this work will be changed, and I purpose making a strong parapet on the line to be staked out by the engineers.

Major-General.
