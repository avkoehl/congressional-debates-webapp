I would respectfully recommend that Page's, Young's, and Cosnahan's batteries be sent to the Reserve Artillery, under the brigadier-general commanding, until reorganized. At present they are not organized, efficient companies. They require repairs and refitting, which cannot be accomplished in the field. I request that an efficient six-gun battery be sent to replace them.

P. HAMILTON.

Lieutenant of Artillery and Adjutant.

I will not delay this report for Captain Kemper's. As soon as it is received at this office will forward it to headquarters.

P. HAMILTON, Adjutant.
