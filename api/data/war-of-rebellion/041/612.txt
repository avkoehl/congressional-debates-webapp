HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS, July 2, 1863.

Commodore MORRIS:

Some apprehensions are entertained that vessels may be sent from this city up the river to aid the rebels. I have given orders that no steamer or other vessel not on Government service be allowed to pass the river, except by special authority from these headquarters.

I have, therefore, respectfully to suggest, if you can conveniently do so, that you will station a vessel at the parapet, with orders to let no vessel pass unless she is on Government service or has a permit from these headquarters.

I have the honor to be, commodore, your obedient servant,W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
