taken from the list have been paroled and sent as directed. But as only one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, and no major remain on the list, the 'same proportion as in the last order" could not be maintained.

I have completed the fifty by taking captains and lieutenants from the list to make up the deficiency of colonels, lieutenant-colonels, and majors.

You are familiar with the doctrine of by pres in law, applied to the interpretation of wills, which requires, when the intention of the testator cannot be literally executed, that it shall be executed as nearly as possible, and that rule I have applied to your order.
