you should have guarded against it. You had not ordered or asked guard for that position before or during the leaving of the troops.

I was ordered to leave but one regiment and left four companies besides. You kept two companies of the Eighteenth and Twenty-ninth, and a regiment was in reach at Bethel. I am satisfied there is no formidable force near you. Report the condition of things.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

JACKSON, July 29, 1862.

[General McCLERNAND:]

I cannot say that you should be surprised at my not sending a company to Medon. I did not know of any danger there. When two regiments were going by land to Bolivar the bridge was attacked and burnt. I sent force there. How could I guard against an attack north without anybody to leave here? I had but two small regiments left. The Eleventh got in last night; the rest were guarding the road.

Can I guard all the roads and property here with such a force as is left me, and at the same time re-enforce any of the points when I can have no notice of the attack? The companies that were left from the regiments you spoke of were left as camp guard for their regimental property.

If they don't want their property guarded they can send and take them away. I am doing everything in my power, and if complaints arise from that I am willing to meet the responsibility.

I shall send a force as soon as I can get a train to repair the bridge at Medon, which has been burned. I don't suppose there is any great force near here, and if there is I shall not ask for help until I see the necessity for it.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

The officer at Medon reports otherwise. I ordered the Eighteenth and Twenty-ninth here. You kept four of these companies. I repeat that I have a detail at Medon repairing the bridge or road. If you prefer it I would rather General Ross would guard at Toone's and for you to re-enforce at Medon.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

BOLIVAR, TENN., July 29, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

The company sent by you had not reached Medon at 2 o'clock p. m. The two companies of the Eighth dropped at Toone's day before yesterday at my instance and the detail from Eighteenth previously sent by you ought to go with these regiments and Colonel Lawler, unless there is an overruling reason to the contrary.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.
