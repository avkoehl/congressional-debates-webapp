HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,August 31, 1864.

Captain WEIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Division:

CAPTAIN: I have to report that a force of ten or twelve of the enemy attacked the picket-line, near the Blackwater, of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, but were easily driven off. They were dismounted and seemed to desire to break through the picket-line. They have not been heard of since. Rebel scouts were seen at other points along the line, but they made no attack; otherwise, everything is quiet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The artillery and infantry for this garrison will be selected by you from the garrison at Fort Pocahontas and Wilson's Wharf.
