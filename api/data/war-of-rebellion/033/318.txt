Washington, June 12, 1863-12.05 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:

It is reported to me that Price, with about 4,000 men and eight pieces of artillery, has gone to Jacksonport to make a raid into Southeastern Missouri.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 13, 1863.

(Received 4.40 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

It seems impossible to send move troops west from Kansas. General Blunt is continually asking for re-enforcements for Colonel Phillips, at Fort Gibson. Price is threatening Southeastern Missouri. I will arm some more militia, and send a regiment of cavalry west. I am told no more troops can be raised there.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 13, 1863.

(Received June 14, 9.45 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I believe Price intends to strike some post on the river, probably New Madrid. I have only one small regiment there, and cannot send any more. Would it not be better to abandon that place, under these circumstances?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, June 14, 1863-1.30 p. m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Saint Louis, Mo.:

New Madrid in the hands of the enemy would close the river. It must be held. In case of danger, get re-enforcements from Island Numbers 10, Columbus, and Cairo. General Hurlbut will be ordered to give you all possible aid. Also apply to Captain Pennock, at Cairo, for aid of any gunboats on hand. Strengthen the works. Impress labor for that purpose, if necessary. Put a reliable officer in command, with orders to hold it to the last moment.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 14, 1863.

Governor GAMBLE, Jefferson City:

Additional demands upon me for troops compel me to ask you for four additional regiments of Enrolled Militia for active service for thirty days. I would suggest that they be called out in Saint Louis County, as they will probably be required at Pilot Knob and Rolla.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
