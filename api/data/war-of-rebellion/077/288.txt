Tupelo road. No enemy, however, appeared, except a few pickets, and about 6. 30 a. m. I was ordered to move my command across the creek and take up the line of march upon the Tupelo road. The enemy left 17 dead bodies upon that part of the field over which my two regiments passed.

I have the express my warmest thanks and admiration to both officers and men of the Fourteenth and Twenty-seventh Iowa for the gallantry which they displayed throughout the long charge up hill, under a severe fire, driving the enemy with heavy loss nearly three-quarters of a mile from a strong covered position; and to Lieutenant Donnan, of my staff, especially, I would say he has my heartfelt thanks for the heroic manner in which he conducted himself, ever present in the thickest of the fight, rendering all the assistance in his power to effect the grand object which was so well achieved.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

JAMES I. GILBERT,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
