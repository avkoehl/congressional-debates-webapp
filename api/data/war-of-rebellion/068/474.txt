Lieutenant Colonel ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Corps:

COLONEL: I arrived with my column at this point some fifteen minutes since. My aide will show you the position I take. I have no communication with the left column. My aides have been used as orderlies. Can you send me some cavalry? There is a signal station on Jones' road, some 2 miles from here. I have sent men to capture the men there. There were two rebel pickets on this road. Nothing else of interest.

Yours, &amp;c.,

A. AMES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.

COBB'S HOUSE, May 6, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

The left of my line occupied its position at 8.30 a. m. I am running my line of battle toward Ware Bottom Church north 15 west from this point. I am very anxious that General Gillmore should take his place in line as soon as possible. We have met no enemy, and have heard of none. Am anxious that the artillery and entrenching tools be sent as soon as possible.

Your obedient servant,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

P. S.-Rebel signal dispatches found here show that General Pickett was in Petersburg last evening.
