MARINE HOSPITALS.
Mr. GRIMES. I desire to offer a resolution.
As it is a mere resolution of inquiry, I desire that
it may be passed at this time:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury he directed
to inform the Senate of the number and location of marine
hospitals; the number of seamen or patients admitted into
each, front 1854 to 1859, inclusive, in each year ; the num-
ber and compensation of the pei&ons employed in each;
and the total expenditure at each hospital for each of the
years aforesaid.
Mr. PUGH. That matter has been referred to
a committee of the Senate for examination, and it
seems to me that it is not worth while to have
this document sent here, and nut us to the ex-
pense of printing it. No douot the committee
will ascertain all this information. Unless the
chairman of the Committee on Commerce desires
it, I prefer that the resolution should lie over.
Mr. CLAY. 1 have no objection to the reso-
lution. I will say, however, that the subject is
before the Committee on Commerce on two reso-
lutions which have already been submitted to that
committee, and will be*reportcd on hereafter. I
shall not object to this resolution, because it can
do no harm.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection to the consideration of the resolution.
The resolution was agreed to.

EMPLOYES.
On motion of Mr. BRIGHT, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following resolutions sub-
mitted by him, from the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, on the 26th of January:
Resolved. That the Commuted to Audit and Control the
Contingent Expenses of the Senate is hereby authorized to
place the names of the persons employed on the heating
and ventilating, gas and watei apparatus of the north wing
of the Capitoi, upon the pay rolls of the contingent innd of
the Senate: and they shall* be paid lor the prj>ent month
the sumo compensation? as are now allowed to the persons
i in the bume positions in the south winy of the Capitol.
I Resolved, Thai all persons employed on the heating and
j ventilating, sa* and water apparatus of the north wing of
! the Capitol, shall be undei the control oi, and shall receive
directions from, the Seigeant-at-Arm^ of the Senate.
Mr. BRIGHT. An amendment is necessary,
in consequence of the delay in passing the reso-
lutions. I move to strike out the words u for the
present month,'1 and insert "from and after the
1st daj'of January, 1860."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. BRIGHT. If any explanation is neces-
sary as to the object of the resolutions, I ask the
Secretary to read a letter from the superintendent
of the Capitol extension, which will explain the
whole matter.
The Secretary read the letter, as follows:
Office United States Capitol E\te>sion^
Washington. December 1*2, 1859.
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that the heating and
ventilating apparatus oi the north wins i> now leady to turn
over to the control oi the oiliccr> oi the Senate.
Since the adjournment of the la-<t Congress, some altera-
tions have beÂ« n made in the air-duets by Captain Meigs,
my predecessor, which it is believed have improved the
distribution of the heated air. If the arrangement is now
satisfactory to the Senate, there seems to be no reason why
its proper officers should not take charge of the apparatus
so that the appropriation for the Capitol extension may be
relieved from the burden of it? support.
I inclose with this a hst of the persons employed in tak-
ing care of the apparatus, with their rates of daily pay.
These persons are six in number, and have charge of the
two engines and ventilating fans, the boileis, steam and
water pipes, registers, and all other parts of the heating and
ventilating apparatus, and do al! the work connected with
it. They have been employed upon the work for some
time, and the engineer and his assistant have icceived a
thorough training in the proper manipulation of the ma-
chinery, in all its parts. They are competent, too, to man-
age the gas and water fittings of the north wing, and the
care of these fittings might properly be turned over to
them.
I lespectfully recommend that these persons be retained
in their present positions, as their removal, and the appoint-
ment of inexperienced persons, might cause serious incon-
venience to the Senate, by the derangement of the entire
apparatus.
Whatever directions may be given by the Senate, as to
the steps to be taken to carry out its views of this matter,
will be cheerfully complied with,and all possible informa-
tion, as to the annual expense of the maintenance of the
apparatus, wiil be given to the officer whose duty it is to
take charge of it.
I am, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
W. B. FRANKLIN,
Captain of Topographical Engineers
in charge Capitol Extension.
Hon. John C. Breckinridge, Vice Presidentof the Untied
States and President of the Senate.
Mr. HALE. I shall not vote against the reso-
lution; but I perceive that it is based on a contin-
gency which 1 wish to protest against. The officer
says that, if the arrangement is satisfactory, he
wants the thing done so and so. It is not satis-
factory to me at all; and I give notice that, at no
very distant day, I shall endeavor to find out what
is the sense of the Senate on this arrangement. I
would rather sit in the old Senate Chamber than
here; but I shall not interpose any objection to the
resolution now.
The resolution, as amended, was agreed to.
DISBURSING OFFICERS.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. I should be very glad
to call up a little resolution which has been lying
before the Senate for some time. It passed the
Senate at the last session, and has been reported
by the Committee on Commerce at this session.
It is merely to facilitate the settlement of the ac-
counts of certain disbursing officers, who were
charged v/ith the improvement of the Ohio river,
some years ago, and a certain sum was appropri-
ated to build the boats necessary for the purpose,
and a certain other sum for the improvement of
the river. It is found that the sum appropriated
for buildingthe boats was somewhat deficient, and
a part of the money intended to go to the im-
provement of the river was applied to the build-
ing of the boats. That is all.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state to the Senator from Kentucky, that he is
obliged at this hour to call up the special order.
Does the Senator ask unanimous consent to con-
sider the joint resolution to which he refers?
Mr. CIIITTENDEN. I do.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. It was the intention of
the Senator from Alabama [Mr. Clay] to call it
up; but I do not see him here now.
The VICE PRESIDENT, (after a pause.)
The Secretary has a difficulty m finding the reso-
lution referred to.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. If the Clerk cannot find
it, and it can be takrn up at the next sitting of
the Senate, I will not press my motion now.
ADMISSION OF KANSAS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ The Chair now
calls up the special order, being jhe unfinished
business of yesterday, which is a bill to authorize
the sale of public arms to the several States and
Territories. *
Mr. SEWARD. By the courtesy of the Sen-
ate, as I undfistood, I was to have the privilege
to-day of calling up the bill which I submitted
some days asro for the admission of Kansas. I
ask that that bill mav now have its second reading.
Thg VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
New York moves to postpone the special order
with a view to take up the bill for the admission
of Kansas into the Union.
Mr. DAVIS. To what time is it proposed to
postpone the special order5
