HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 17, 1862

Brigadier General J. H. WINDER.

GENERAL: The commanding general authorizes the employment of such forces as you have about Richmond if need be for the proper protection of the prisoners. He, however, further desires that measures may be adopted to prevent a recurrence of difficulties about bread, as its want is calculated to discredit us and naturally to exasperate the prisoners who have a right to expect a sufficiency to appease hunger.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

[R. H. CHILTON.]

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Form 22.]

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 18, 1862

Brigadier General JOHN H. WINDER,

Commanding Department of Henrico.

GENERAL: Your letter* of the 16th was received last night and you were informed to use all the force at your command for the security of the prisoners. I request you will send me a return of the troops under your orders and their disposition and whether they are sufficient for the purpose. I desire you also to make arrangements to supply the prisoners with their rations. I see no reason for their being in want of bread. There is plenty of flour in Richmond and with proper arrangements it could be baked.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
