in this position, and rendering it such that should the enemy turn the left they will have an available force to meet the movement. I send you two dispatches * from signal officers, showing the enemy are re-enforcing and moving to their right, whether with a view to attempt to dislodge us or simply to resist an advance cannot at present be told.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., October 3, 1864-12 m.

Major-General MEADE:

I shall go to Washington to-morrow and see if I cannot devise means of getting promptly into the field the large number of recruits that I understand are now in depots all over the North. Will be gone three or four days. In my absence would like to have present lines held, if possible, but if necessity requires it, all or as much as is necessary west of the Weldon road may be abandoned. One corps, or as many troops as possible, from the Army of the James, will be held foot loose, to operate on the defensive at any place threatened. General Butler, the senior officer present, will command during my absence.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 3, 1864-3.30 p. m. (Sent 4 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I regret to learn that you are compelled to go to Washington. Am I to understand the forces north of the James are withdrawn or going to be? The holding a corps foot loose causes me to ask the question. Cannot Hancock be relieved up to the Jerusalem plank road, which would give me his two divisions as a reserve on the left and would make me quite secure?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

October 3, 1864-10 p. m. (Sent 10.30 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Nothing of importance has occurred to-day, excepting the driving in of Parke's pickets in front of the Pegram house, our extreme left, about 3 p. m.; the line was, however, immediately re-established. My lines on the left are now so secure, against any attack that I propose to-morrow to return Mott's division to the Second Corps line. Redoubts are being constructed on the new line not only in front but on the flank and in rear. I do not think the enemy will attempt to disturb us now.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
