of the Potomac for the support of Ewell's corps to the 30th instant, and 1, 700 barrels of flour are on hand in Maryland for the rest of the army. I hope we shall get enough for the subsistence of our men. Forage is very scarce, and we have mainly to rely on grass for the animals . From the reports I receive, I believe we shall obtain enough salt for our purposes while north of the Potomac, for which we are paying 75 cents a bushel . The flour that we have purchased in Maryland costs&amp; 6. 50 barrel ; beef, &5 per hundred, gross . We use Confederate money for all payments . I shall continue to purchase all the supplies that are furnished me while north of the Potomac, impressing only when necessary. With great respect, your obedient servant,

- HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, Near Gettysburg, Pa., July 4, 1863.

Mr. PRESIDENT: After the rear of the army had crossed the Potomac, leading corps, under General Ewell, pushed on to Carlisle and York,, passing through Chambersburg . The other two corps closed up at the latter place, and soon afterward intelligence was received that the army of General Hooker was advancing . Our whole force was directed to concentrate at Gettysburg, and the corps of Generals Ewell and A. P. Hill reached that place on the 1st July the former advancing from Carlisle and the latter from Chambersburg . The two leading divisions of these corps, upon reaching the vicinity of Gettysburg, found the enemy, and attacked him, driving him from the town, which was occupied by our troops . The enemy's loss was heavy, including more, than 4, 00 prisoners . He took up a strong position in rear of the town, which he immediately began to fortify, and where his re-enforcements joined him . On the 2nd July, Longstreet's corps, with the exception of one division, having arrived, we attempted to dislodge the enemy, and, though we gained some ground, we were unable to get possession of his position . The next day, the third division of General Longstreet having come up, a more extensive attack was made. The works on the enemy's extreme right and left were taken, but his numbers were so great and his position so commanding, that our troops were compelled to relinquish their advantage and retire. It is believed that the enemy suffered severely in these operations, but our own loss has not bee light. General Barksdale is killed . Generals Garnett and Armistead are missing a prisoner . Generals Pender and Trimble are wounded in the leg, General Hood in the arm, and General Heth slightly in the head . general Kemper, . it is feared, is mortally wounded . Our losses embrace many other valuable officers and men . General Wade Hampton was severely wounded in a different action a in which the cavalry was engaged yesterday . Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

His Excellency President DAVIS, Richmond.
