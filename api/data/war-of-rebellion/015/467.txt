Johnson's (Twelfth Ohio) battery, to be placed upon the pike, but they could not be placed in position until after twilight.

From 3 p.m. until 8 o'clock our small force engaged with undaunted bravery a force of the enemy which could not have been less than 5,000 men, and maintained the position from which they had driven them, displaying a courage and zeal which has merited the thanks of the country and proved them true representatives of the American citizen soldier. After night-fall the engagement was continued, the firing of our men being guided only by the flashes of the enemy's musketry, until the ammunition of almost all the men engaged was wholly exhausted, when, having achieved the purpose of the attack, our forces were recalled, retiring in good order, bringing with them their dead and wounded.

While I would be glad to bring prominently to the notice of the major-general commanding the names of the officers and men who distinguished themselves in the action, I could not do so without rehearsing the names of all engaged. Neither officer nor man of those engaged faltered in the performance of his whole duty.

The Twenty-fifth and Seventy-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiments, in their gallant advance; the Thirty-second Ohio, in a daring bayonet charge, and the Third West Virginia, in their endurance of the most severe fire of the enemy, alike merit his entire approbation.

To Brigadier-General Schenck, for his advice, counsel, and active co-operation, and to the officers and men of the Eighty-second Ohio Volunteer Infantry, who so bravely sustained my brigade, I owe my warmest thanks.

I forward herewith a report of the killed, wounded, and missing of my brigade.

I am, general, very respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

R. H. MILROY,

Brigadier-General.
