wire and destroyed the road. I have ordered a force there with Engineer Regiment to repair. I feared this when I was ordered to send from here nearly all the troops.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, July 28, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

Have we any force now at the burning bridge? Keep a sharp lookout for rebel forces, and if they are needed I will send you troops from here at once. I will have all the cars here in readiness to send troops should they be needed.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

We have about 50 infantry stationed at the burnt bridge. The Engineer Regiment have gone there, about 300 strong, armed and equipped.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, July 28, 1862.

General LOGAN:

What was extent of damage done the road? How far north of Jackson? What force was supposed to be engaged? Did we lose any men, and what number? Was the rebel loss anything, or did not men leave without firing? Had the train from Columbus passed?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, [July] 28, [1862].

Major-General GRANT:

The extent of damages I do not know. The courier left while trestle was burning. Distance from Jackson, 14 miles. Force supposed to be some 300 cavalry. Our loss was said to be some 4 or 5 wounded. I did not learn that any were killed. Rebel loss, 4 killed and 5 prisoners. The train from Columbus had not passed down. I learn that a large cavalry force, with perhaps 200 infantry, crossed Hatchie last night about 18 miles from here. They may be the force.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

JACKSON, July 28, 1862.

Major-General McCLERNAND, Bolivar, Tenn.:

Colonel Bryant is in pursuit of the enemy and will camp at Poplar Corners to-night. Where shall I order him?

Brigadier-General.
