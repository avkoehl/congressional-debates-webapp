Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Brigadier General M. W. GARY:

You will bring your battalion of dismounted men over to the Darbytown road and report to General Kershaw to relive the two right brigades of General Field on the line at once. You will place your mounted men on guard along the line where you now have dismounted men.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Brigadier General M. W. GARY,

Commanding, &c.:

You will report in person with the dismounted men to General Kershaw. Your mounted force will remain along the line and perform the same duty they have been doing. Relieve all the dismounted men on picket by mounted men, so as to take all your dismounted force with you. Keep a sharp lookout on all the roads, as it will be very necessary now. See that no one passes the outer lines on any pretext either way. The few dismounted men on the intermediate line might remain.

O. LATROBE,
