Major-general SMITH, Commanding DIVISION:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to advise you that he has ordered the SEVENTEENTH Louisiana Regiment to be thrown on your right, in order to support you in case of an attack on you by Sherman, in conjunction with Ellet's Marine Brigade, which the movements of the enemy in the river render probable.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,W. H. McCARDLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. DEPT. MISS AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 29, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that the demonstrations of the enemy in the river indicate an attack upon our batteries, and that it is necessary for you to throw GENERAL [M. E.] Green's brigade near Sterling's batteries, in order that it may be held in readiness to move to the support of any point assailed.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. McCARDLE,

HEADQUARTERS ON THE RIGHT, May 29, [1863.]

Major MEMMINGER, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

The order of the lieutenant-general with regard to the disposition of General Green's brigade has been received. General Green has not reported to me, and I do not know where his command is located.

When General Bowen's first brigade was removed from the river front, I understood the lieutenant-general to say that the whole of his DIVISION would be held in reserve between the railroad and Jackson road.

Respectfully,C. L. STEVENSON.

HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 29, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant- general commanding to say it is highly probable that there will be an attack along the whole line of intrenchments and on the river to-night. You will, therefore, hold yourself prepared.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
