THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 23,
$30,500,000. From 1840 to 1845 it was
$27,000,000. Prom 1845 to 1850, in the latter
part of which period the expenses for the Mex-
ican war came in, it was $40,500,000. From
1850 to 1855 it was $47,500,000. From 1855
to June 30, 1861, it was $67,000,000. From
June 30, 1861, to June 30, 1866, $713,750,000,
and from June 30,1866, to June 30, 1871, the
annual average was $189,000,000.
It is interesting to inquire how far we may
reasonably expect to go in the descending
scale before we reach the new level of peace.
We have already seen that it took England
twenty years after Waterloo before she reached
such a level. Our own experience has been
peculiar in this, that our people have been
impatient of debt, and have always determ-
inedly set about the work of reducing it.
Throughout our history there has been a
curious uniformity in the movement of the
annual expenditures for the years immediately
following our wars. We have not the data to
determine how long it was after the war of
independence before the current expenditures
ceased to decrease, that is, before they readied
the point where the natural growth of expendi-
tures more than balanced the tendency to re-
duction of war expenditure, but in the year
immediately following all our subsequent wars
the decrease has continued for a period almost
exactly twice the length of the war itself.
After the war of 1812-15, the expenditures
continued to decline for eight years, reaching
the lowest point in 1823.
After the Seminole war, which ran through
three years, 1836, 1837, and 1838, the new
level was not reached until 1844, six years
after its close.
After the Mexican war, which lasted two
years, it took four years, until 1852, to reach
the new level of peace.
It is perhaps unsafe to base onr calculations
for t.he future on these analogies; but the wars
already referred to have been of such varied
character, and their financial effects have been
so uniform, as to make itnotunreasonableto ex-
pect that a similar result will follow our late war.
If so, the decrease of our ordinary expenditures,
exclusive of the principal and interest of the
public debt, will continue until 1875 or 1876.
It will be seen by an analysis of our current
expenditures, that, exclusive of charges on the
public debt, nearly fifty million dollars are
expenditures directly for the late war, and
many of them will not again appear, such as
the bounty and back pay of volunteer soldiers
and payment of illegal captures of British ves-
sels and cargoes. We may reasonably expect
that the expenditures for pensions will here-
after steadily decrease, unless our legislation
should be unwarrantably extravagant. We
may also expect a large decease in expend-
itures for the internal revenue department.
Possibly, we may ultimately be able to abolish
the department altogether. In the account-
ing and disbursing bureaus of the Treasury
Department we may also expect a further
reduction of the force now employed in set-
tling war claims.
We cannot expect so rapid a reduction of
the public_ debt and its burden of interest as
we have witnessed for the last three years; but
the reduction will doubtless continue, and will
constantly decrease the public burden. I know
it is not safe to attempt to forecast the future,
but I venture to express the belief that if peace
continues the year 1876 will witness our ordin-
ary expenditures, exclusive of the public debt,
reduced to $125,000,000, and the interest on
our public debt to $95,000,000; making our
total expenditures, exclusive of payment on
the principal of the public debt, $230,000,000.
Judging from the experience of our own and
of other nations, we may not hope thereafter
to reach a lower figure. In making this esti-
mate I have assumed that there will be a con-
siderable reduction of the burdens of taxation,
and a revenue not nearly in so great excess of
the expenditures as we now have.
The movement of our public debt may
be thus summarily stated: commencing with
January 1, 1789, we had a debt of $75,000,000.
It took twenty-one years to reduce its bulk to
$45,000,000, the figure which was reached
in 1812. The war with England raised it to
$127,000,000, where it stood in 1816. It took
twenty years more to pay it off. The war with
Mexico left us with a debt of $68,000,000, and
it took ten years to reduce it to $28,500,000,
the lowest point it has ever reached since 1846.
The debt of our late war reached its stupend-
ous maximum on 31st July, 1865. In the six
and a half years that have since elapsed we
have reduced it by the sum of $556,500,000,
which is a reduction of twenty and a half per
cent, of its whole amount. During that time
we have also reduced the amount of annual
interest on the debt by $42,500,000.

Department, which exhibits, in successive

_ This rapid reduction of the principal and
interest of our public debt tends also to
strengthen the hope that for three or four
years to come our expenditures may continue
todecrease. It would be happy, indeed, if we
might also hope that when the nation again
begins the ascent it will be up the beautiful
slope where no sign of war shall come for
many long years. If so, the ascent will be
gradual and gentle, and will mark the course
of that highway along which the nation shall
move upward and forever upward in its grand
career of glory and_ prosperity. But let it be
forever borne in mind that the day which wit-
nesses a new war increases more and more
heavily than ever the calamities of the past.
t Increase over July 31, 1865, $10,554,688.
For the burdens of the past are mainly the
burdens of war, and there is a point to which
a national debt may raise when its people lose
heart andgrow hopeless under the burden.
Conceding to England all her wealth, all her
greatness, and all her glory, still one fact in
her history is so full of gloomy portent that I
have never been able to understand how her
statesmen couid look upon it without the pro-
foundest alarm. It would seem that all hope
of paying off, or even of considerablyreducing
her public debt, is extinguished in the minds
of her people. The last attempt in that direc-
tion was made by the chancellor of the ex-
chequer, Mr. Gladstone, in his budget speech
of 1866. After affirming that nine leading
nations of Europe had incurred a debt of no
less than <£1,500,000,000 sterling during the
last twenty-five years, and that, too, in a
time of very general peace, he said that Amer-
ica was the only great nation of the world
that was now considerably reducing her debt.
Then referring to the British debt, he said :
"At the close of the war against France in 1815,
the British debt was £902.264,000. On the 5th Jan-
uary, 1854, it was £800,515,000. 'From 1815 to 1854,
there were nearly forty years of the most profound
tranquillity ever known in this country." ■" *
* * "The rate of decrease during that period
was£2,609,000perannum." x ^ * * "I
do not believe if we take the whole years of peace
s>nce 1815, that the average reduction would reach
£3,000,000. If ever we should become involved in
any great and protracted war, we must expect to see
the debt increase at about ten times the annual rate
by which we reduce it in time of peace."
In order to judge more accurately of the
future of our expenditures, I ask attention to
au analysis of those of the last fiscal year.
In doing so I will venture a criticism on the
form in which the records'of receipts and ex-
penditures are presented to us in the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury. In prepar-
ing the analysis which I shall present I noticed
several items which I cannot regard as real
expenditures, nor have they ever in fact been
receipts of the Government.
In the report of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury it is stated that, the expenditures for the
past year ending June 30, 1871, amounted to
two hundred and ninety-two million and some
odd thousand dollars.
Now, I call the attention of the committee
to several items included in that $292,000,000
which seem to me should not be counted in
an exhibit of what it costs to run the Govern-
ment. For instance, in exchanging the coin
in the Treasury for outstanding bonds, the
premium on the coin is set down as revenue,
and the premium on the bonds purchased is set
down as an expenditure. Of course the books
of the Treasury ought to show these transac-
tions in full ; but it does not seem to me that
the two amounts should go to swell the receipts
and expenditures of the Government. The
one is not revenue in the ordinary meaning of
that term, nor is it expenditure. Yet here,
on pages 3 and 5 of the tables appended to
the Secretary's report, are set down as pre-
miums on sales of coin, nearly nine million
dollars, and as premiums paid on purchase
of bonds, a little more than nine millions.
It seems to me the figures presented to the
country ought to be different between the two
sums as part of the expense of managing the
national debt. That difference, we find, is
only $123,954; yet by this record the Gov-
ernment is charged with having expended
$9,000,000 for that purpose.
Here is another item. I understand that
when a ship arrives in port, and the mer-
chant desires to get his goods at once, he
makes a deposit at the custom-house of a sum
larger than the amount of tariff, and that when
the amount of duty ascertained is collected
there is to be a sum returned to him. Now,
all the sums paid back to merchants in this
way, sums which never belonged to the Treas-
ury, never were revenue, in fact are charged as
expenditures. On page 4, under the head-
ing of "miscellaneous expenditures,1' I find
this entry: "refunding excess of deposits for
unascertained duties, $1,787,266 59."
There is anotheritem, which gentlemen who
care to follow these remarks, will also find on
page i. When irnportedgoods are reexported
a drawback is allowed to the full amount of the
duty. In many cases the duty does not come
into the Treasury at all, and of course the
canceling of the duty is not a payment out
of the Ireasury. That sum should neither be
reckoned as expenses nor as receipts; but yet
$978,358 of "debenture drawbacks under the
customs laws" are set down among the expendi-
tures for the last fiscal year. Yet both this and
the preceding item are set down as a part of
the cost of collecting the customs revenue.
