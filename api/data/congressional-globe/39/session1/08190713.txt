it lias got to be followed in the future. It will
be applied to other portions of the country than

INTK31NAL R^VLXVE.
Mr.AVARI-IKURXE, of Illinois. I am di-
rected bv the Committee on Commerce to aM<
the cou ^ent of the ilouse to ha\e a bill reported
and put upon it:- pa—age at the present time.
I will ask to ba\e the bill read, i think then.1
will be no objection to it. It is a matter of
considerable importance demanding immediate
action.
Mr. MORRILL. I must ask the gentleman
to withhold it until we act on the lull which
was pending last evening. I call for the regu-
lar order of business.
The SPEAKER stated that the regular or-
der of business was the consideration of bill of
the House No. HOI, to declare the meaning
of certain parts of the internal revenue act.
approved J une 30, 180-i, and for oilier purposes.
Mr. MORRILL. The first part of this bill
is intended to reach all the stockholders of
certain corporations who are taxed by the in-
ternal revenue law, whether they arc citizens,
residents, or aliens. By a decision of the cir-
cuit court of Maryland it has been held that a
certain section of the internal revenue law, in-
tended to apply to the income tax, applied to
thetaxeswdiich are collected from corporations,
and therefore aliens escaped. The iirst part of
the bill is intended to remedy that defect.
The latter part of the hill is intended merely
to apply to returns that have been heretofore
made in some instances by parlies in coin, the
tuxes upon which have been paid in paper. 1
take it there is no objection to the bill. It
meets the approbation of the Department.
Mr. DAVIS. 1 would ask the gentleman if
this bill chanaes the existing law m regard to
scrip dividends.
Mr. MORRILL, ft simply provides that the
law which applies to citizens who tire stock-
holders shall applv to aliens also. JtaiUhm-
izes the corporation to deduct the tax from the
dividends of the parties who own the stock,
whoever they may be. That is done now in
relation to our own citizens and U> our citizens
who reside abroad. B\ a decision of the courts
of Maryland it is held, th.it in the case of for-
eigners the coiporation cannot deduct the tax,
and \et they have to pay It to the Government.
The bill was read. The jseelion pro-

nal Revenue, under the direction of the i^eci etiwy of
the Treasury, is hereby authoiiaed to make all neces-
sary rules and rcgulationij for carrying this act into
ctfect.
Mr. KASSOJT. I desire to ask the gentle-
man a question. This bill declares that the
words ''nil such interest or coupons, dividends
or profits, whenever the same shall be paya-
■ble," shall apply to all such interest or cou-
pons, dividends or profits, whenever the same «
are or may be payable. Now, I desire to in-
quire of the chairman of the committee [Mr.
JJoiir.nx] whether in the case of a declaration
of interest due to these stockholders, but not
paid, it would be covered under this declara-
tion of meaning, although payable at some in-
deiinite or definite future day. in other words,
it these corporations attempt to evade this tax
by postponing the payment of the dividends to
some future time, would they be reached by
this declaration of meaning?
Mr. MOlliULL. f do not think that this bill
changes the existing law in that respect. So
far as dividends are concerned, the surplus
piofits must be reported and taxed each year.
This bill quotes the present law and re'enaetsit
so as to apply it to our own people and aliens
ulike. That is the whole extent of this bill.
Mr. KA.SSON". I fear it will then mislead
us into another difficulty, that the law may be
construed to mean that these corporations can
only be taxed at the time the dividends are pay-
able, and that if they merely issue certificates
of claims to be paid in the future they will not
be taxed.
Mr. MORRILL. The original law enforces
all such interest or responsibility whenever (ho
same is or may be payable. And that portion
oft he law is incorporated 111 this bill in precisely
the same language.
Mr. KASNOA. I always desire to follow the
recommendation of the committee, and shall
not uite against this bill, although f think there
may be some difficulty under it.
f desire now to < all the attention of the gen-
tleman to what 1 suppose to be the omission of
a word in one ol' these sections. Section tour,
as printed, reads :
That whfncvci the rates and amounts crmtainoii
in the ti^ts nrietui'is atoresnid shall be st/tod in
cnnied money, it shall be thedut> ot'eueh aisossorre-
eetvmij Lhe same to reduee ^ueh jaten and amounts to
then e<jim'atent jn ]ec\il-tender einrcriov, according
to the val iie oi'such coined money in said currency at
the time and place where said lists or letuuis aie re-
ceivable, and which value the ^aid as^e^or dc-
1 Limine. And th< h-t.-1 on uned by hnv to be furnished
to m.1 b etoi^ bv ■' --.Crsoiv shall in ail c ases coolant the
^ e\ c> a 1 ani'iar.t. ol tavMn doiicsas t ^ed, estimated,
or \ alu. .1 in S' .;; -S nder eairenoy only.
I think ilio word kk \wien'' has heen omitted
after the word ''time.'' in the clause "value
of such coined money in said currency at the
tmi'k and place where said lists or returns are
receivable." itc.
ilr. MOKKIhL. I will move to amend the
section by in.serting the word ''when' after the
word " time.'5
The amendment was agreed to.
_Mr. ilOlUilLL. 1 now call the previous
rjuostion.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main quesiion ordered: which was upon order-
ing ihe bill to be en^ro^sed and read a third
tune : andl^ine engrossed, it was accordingly
lead the third tune.
The qnesLio3i was upon the passage of the
bin.
.Mr. MORRILL called the previous question.
The previous que*-i'on was seconded, aird
the main question oidorod: and under the oper-
ation thereof, the bill was parsed.
Mr. MOHTJ LL moved to recon.nder the vote
by which the bill was pas"<-d ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
