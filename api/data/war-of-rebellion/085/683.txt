Owing to the removal of my headquarters I did not get you telegram of yesterday until this moment.

The Eighth Enrolled Missouri Militia is guarding bridges from that point south. Colonel Fenn, First Enrolled Missouri Militia, and Colonel Smith are at De Soto furnishing guard for railroad train, and working parties further down the line and scouting.
