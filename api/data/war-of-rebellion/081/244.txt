Colonel Sharpe containing some information respecting the locality of the reservoir as gathered from the negro you sent in last night. The Second Corps will be relieved at dark by the Sixth Corps and Ninth Corps, and held in reserve in rear of the left center. General Burnside is likewise directed to extend, at the same time, his left beyond your right and relieve some part of it, if practicable, so that you may give the greatest possible extension to your left. He may not find it practicable to relieve any part of your present line, however.
