no idea that Hardee will attack you, if you have any cover whatever. Get as many guns in as possible, so that by a simultaneous discharge you can knock a train to pieces at one discharge. It is only on condition that you can get o the road that I would put all of Thomas' troops o that side of the Flint.

Yours,
