MACON, November 19, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

Colonel Ould will declare paroled prisoners exchanged as soon as he can make Yankee delivery. Enemy's movements indicate an advance on Augusta. What defense have you to protect Savannah from land

attack?

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant - General.

SAVANNAH, GA., November 19, 1864.

General HARDEE,

Macon, GA.:

Have no defenses but an inundation, which is not complete and does not cover the crossing of the Charleston railroad one Savannah River. I need the troops on the way to Oconee bridge. Can I recall them?

L. McLAWS,

Major - General.

MACON, November 19, 1864.

Major General L. McLAWS:

The force at the Oconee bridge cannot be spared yet. General Wheeler says that prisoners report that Sherman is going to Savannah by way of Augusta. Be prepared to press negroes if you need them.
