HEADQUARTERS MAURY'S DIVISION, Vicksburg, March 27, 1863.

Major REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Please say to General Stevenson that there are two regiments of Lee's brigade now at Snyder's which it may be as well to have returned to Vicksburg. Say to him, also, that General Loring's forces occupy such a position as will enable him to guard Upper Sunflower better than we can. If practicable for him to do so, our operations will thereby be more concentrated. By referring to map you will perceive that Camp Pemberton is but a few miles from Sunflower River.

Very respectfully, yours,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

VICKSBURG, March 27, 1863.

Brigadier General W. S. FEATHERSTON:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Your letter to General Lee stating the retreat of the enemy down Deer Creek and Black Bayou has just been received. Your suggestion that they are endeavoring to get into your rear is, I think, somewhat weakened by the reports of escaped prisoners, who inform me that the expedition of Sherman returned last night to the fleet a failure. We must now do all can to guard against any future movements of this sort, which you have just defeated, and we must also be very means transfer the supplies from Deer Creek and Sunflower to Haynes' Bluff. Please report to me at once fully as to the best points we should obstruct and defend, and the best means we can adopt to procure those supplies. If your command can return by way of Lower Deer Creek it may the sooner liberate the steamers for transporting supplies. Please to report to me as soon as you think your brigade can be spared from the expedition, because the indications are that we shall soon have work elsewhere. The barges captured from the enemy will be most important conveniences at Haynes' Bluff, if not required where they now are. Please send scouts up Deer Creek and Sunflower as far as possible to report movements of enemy. Facilitate Captain Quaite as much as you can in his duty of getting down the supplies. Please send the Fortieth Alabama first when you return the troops.

Very respectfully, yours,

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.

Brigadier General W. S. FEATHERSTON:

GENERAL: There is immediate need of your brigade in another direction, therefore please move it back to Haynes' Bluff as soon as you can, leaving the Fortieth Alabama with Ferguson until further orders. Bring your two cannon back if they can be spared. These orders are predicated on the information before us that the enemy has abandoned the Deer Creek expedition. They are subsequent to the other instructions contained in my letter of this date. Please send Major Cummins back as soon as possible.

Very respectfully, yours,DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.
