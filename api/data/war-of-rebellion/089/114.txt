HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,October 7, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

City Point:

On my front the enemy is only shelling my key point, Fort Harrison. I see no movements of enemy's troops as yet. I have drawn out a little reserve of six regiments from my line to send to Birney if necessary. From the other points all I hear is that Kautz has been driven in, and that the enemy was on right and rear of Birney. I have heard nothing from there during the last half hour, and at this moment all is quiet there.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
