pensions must be paid. Trie next session the vvn ¡le
subject might be taken up tad actea on u„dsr-
standmgly.
Mr. MANGUM caid there was a «tiorg feeling
on the part of the committee m favor of reusing
the whole pension system, and bringing it b-uk to
a healthful state, to lop off the fungi which crept
sround u, and restore it to soundness and econo-
my. With respect to the fir&t section, there could
be no doubt but that it ought to be passed at one
With iegard to the second, it could be taken ip
early in the cnsum¿ sesión, a1 d then they cou.d
vihce tbr whols sys em tu pnre pico endjnng,
safe, and economical.
Mr. CALHOUN said the proper coarto to be
pursued was to amend the second sec ion. it ¡t
was ambiguous, let that ambigui y he removed.
All must agree that ai officer RCuvirg full pay,
¡•hould not receive a full pension st the sime time,
lfthere were special instances of extraordmary
claims, 1st tbem be st bjects of «pecial action But
let the general rule be established by amending the
second section so as to remove all ambiguity.
Mr. MANG-UM said the committee bad found
it impracticable to do so at the preoent se'sic , an 1,
besides, the subject was exceedingly eomp'ex and
difficult. He T'ai aware that the r. vy pension
fund had undergone a speces ot ao olute ^polia-
non; and he (Mr M.) was as re¿d/ as the Si nator
from South Catolmi cou d be to reform the abuses,
and, at the proper time, he w uld go ivith that Se-
na'or heart aid haiid in th° work, but it \-a one
that should be approarhed vith cau ion and care,
there might b- exceptions in the matter wht h n
would be well to lock to.
Mr. CALHOUN vas very ?Ud to hear th^t tne
STatorhad avowal his inte it on to go so f.tr n i

Stood, it would j,o to exclude ir,uiy very mtri'tri-
oustiheers. H( was clear tha' tht pensions J?ould
be paid until the 1st January, and m the me?a
time the whol  subject could undergo revision  nd

Mr CALHOUN nid h  thoufht fhpre was  o

generously and safely promised lhat, ii t.^is fund

But the Srna'or from Connecticut [Mr Hon-

naval pensions were ever a charge on th-^ Treasu-
