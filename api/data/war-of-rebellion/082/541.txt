Major-General BIRNEY:

In view of a possible attack on our lines, allow me to suggest that the keys to our position are the three advanced works, Redoubts Dutton, McConihe, and Carpenter. They must be held in all events, and their garrisons had better be thus instructed and further informed that can be sent against them. Pardon these suggestion, but I am getting a little nervous with the depletion of our line and the thought of what I would do were I Lee.

Major-General, Commanding.
