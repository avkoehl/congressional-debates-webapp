The. Finances—Mr. Rheti.
Ho. or Reps.
to- the Government. So much is left to the discre-
tion of his subordinates, that it is very difficult to
enforce a strict and speedy responsibility for the
public funds
It would seem to be clear, then, that neither of
the parties which divide the country upon the cur-
rency question can approve of the present state of
the taws which regulate the Treasury Department
If, therefore, the plan now proposed be not the
very best in the opinion of either of these divis-
ions, it is respectfully submitted whether it may
not be fairly entitled to the assent of all who think
jt better than the existing state of things In con-
sideration, therefore, of the reasons which we
jiave presented, we respectfully submit a bill.
THE FINANCES.
SPEECH OF HON. R. B. RHETT,
OP SOUTH CAROLINA,
Is the House o  Representatives,
February 1, 1839,
On the Report of the Committee of "Ways and
Means on the state of the Finances
Mr RHETT rose and said
Mr. Speaker. I am a member of the Commit
tee of Ways and Means, and I trust, therefore,
the House will perceive the propriety of my de-
fending the report this committee has made on the
state of the finances, and of showing, if I can,
that the "magnificent blunders" and "scandalous
ignorance" imputed to it by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr Bibdie] exist rather in his
fancy than in fact. So enormous and complica-
ted, indeed, do our errors appear, m the sober
«stimation of that gentleman, that the usual pro-
cess of amendment in the House will not do. On
a motion made by the chairman of the committee
[Mr Cambrelino] for leave to strike out a single
sentence in a part of the appendix, containing a
statement from the Indian Bureau, the gentleman
from Pennsylvania moves to recommit the whole
report, that it may undergo a thorough and labo-
rious lustration from its manifold impurities For-
tunately, sir, the gentleman has given us an enu-
meration of our errors, by which the House can
judge of the propriety of his motion, and the
labors of the committee, if his motion prevails,
may be greatly abridged.
Butbefoie I enter on these imputed errors in
the report, permit me to say a few words as to
the principles on which the House will recommit
a report, or the members of a committee may be
held responsible for its facts It is most obvious
that in a laborious and lengthy document, like
that under consideration, containing thousands of
facts, there may be slight inaccuracies both in
fact and inferences, which the committee may
overlook, and the House would disregard But
if any material fact, lefdingto any material prin-
ciple, is misstated, the committee, the whole com-
mittee, is blamable, and if many such errors
exist, so as to render it at all difficult to rectify
them in the House, the report ought to be recom-
mitted. I will add one other principle not affect-
ing the relations between the committee and the
House "Libels" or "scandals," (as the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania calls them,) on indi-
viduals not on this floor, ought clearly to be
stricken from a report They constitute, indeed,
good ground for contemptuously spurning the
document which contains them from your table
No*, 'with these principles for our conduct,
which, I trust, will obtain the sanction of every
gentleman who hears me, let us examine the
errors imputed to the committee by the gentleman
from .Pennsylvania
The first—and, if it exists at all, I trust I will
show the only error—tn fact made by the commit-
tee, is that with respect to the pension laws, which
the gentleman from Pennsylvania has quoted in
his speech, now m my hand
" Prior to 1836," says the report, " there was
« no departure from the ordinary pension rules,
« exceptas to revolutionary soldiers, butin that
« year, provision was made generally for pensions
' in ordinary cases of death, while m the service
' after the 20th April, 1818, whether of wounds or
« not "
The gentleman from Pennsylvania contends that
the act of 1836 included the militiaonly, whereas,
the statement m this clause of the report is, that
it includes the regular Army also, and that this is
a foul imputation on the twelve thousand men who
compose it Now, sir, I am willing to admit, that
the inference contended for may be deduced from
the words of the report Certainly its language
is not quite as explicit as I should desire; but the
question is not whether there is room for an ei-
íoneous inference by those Who may be ignorant
of our pension laws, but whether there is any
error in fact Has the report stated what is untrue,
as the gentleman maintains ' This will turn, en-
tirely, on the meaning of the word "generally "
in the clause Neither the regular Army, nor the
militia, are expressly mentioned Does the use
of this woid, necessarily include the regular Army'
The gentleman admits that the whole militia are
provided for by the act of 1836 Well, is it not,
then, a provision " generally " for the whole mili-
tia' and when the act itself, in reference to which
the committee uses this general phraseology, is
specifically mentioned, and quoted as its authority,
what ground can there be for misapprehension f
The committee is addressing the Congiess of the
United States, an assembly of distinguished law
yers, and it ought not to be a very violent pre-
sumption, that they are not entirely ignorant of the
act of 1836,and will, therefore, not feel profoundly
puzzled with the general phrase used in describing
it The act of 1836, is a general act in favor of
the militia, it would be more general, if it extended
to the regular Army; it would be still more general
if it embraced all the officers and retainers of the
Government, whether in its civil or military em-
ployment. But because legislation, extending to
the militia and regular Army, or all the officers of
this Government, would be geneial, it does not
follow that legislation, with respect to any one of
these great departments of service, may not, with
propriety, be termed general also To maintain
the contrary would involve us in an absurd calcu-
lation of quantities
But there is another clause on which the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania relies, to prove that the
regular Army was included in their general phrase-
ology " If," says the committee, m concluding
their remarks on the subject of pensions, " we
' continue to grant pensions in cases of ordinary
• death, in peace orm war, to the representatives
' of all who are employed in the military service,
' whether in the regular Army or not, and to all in
' the naval service, we shall soon follow the ex-
' ample of some monarchies," &c. Here, again,
is loose phiaseology, but there is no assertion that
the innovation Bpoken of actually extends to all
the services enumerated, for if so, then the sug-
gestion that we shall soon follow the example of
some monarchies, is absurd We are actually fol-
lowing their example The clause is merely hypo-
thetical It supposes a state of things not exist-
ing, and points to their example to be avoided
But I am willing, Mr Speaker, to admit, if the
gentleman wishes it, that the regular Army are
included in the general phraseology the committee
has used, what harm is it> The committee is
arguing upon grave matters of principle and policy
It says that a departure from the principle of
pensioning only the families of those who fall in
battle, or die of wounds received in the service,
has been made, and they quote the act of 1836 to
support their assertion. Thatsuchlegislationexists
with respect to the militia and the Navy, is not
denied Of what consequence, sir, is it to the
principle against which they are contending—of
what consequence can it be to the House in legis-
lating on these great principle—if, m their general
phraseology, they do imply or assert that the reg-
ular Army is favored by similar legislation' Cer-
tainly the intelligence of the House can be but
little perverted by so harmless an error But then
it is a foul wrong to individuals—it is an atrocious
slander on the regular Army, who, not being here
to defend themselves, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania generously steps forth to shield them
from the imputation. Sir, we have suddenly be-
come very chary on the subject of pensions. I
like this tone of high disdain, as being supposed
to be pensioners on this Government, but I fear
the gentleman has it all to himself, and that there
is but very little participation in his feelings by
those whom he supposes himself defending.   If
such anoble spirit of independence existed, there
would be some hope that our whole pension sys-
tem, not exceeded in profligacy by that of any
people on eaith, would some day or other come
to an end, instead of growing young with years,
and accumulating with evei y exhaustion Your
army of forty-two thousand pensionéis might
then be disbanded The propositions pertina-
ciously made here every session, to extend your
pension laws to new objects, might then cease, and
no more pension bills would be smuggled through
this House unobserved at the close of the session,
absorbing millions. But 1 fear, sir, that the gen-
tleman fiom Pennsylvania is greatly mistaken in
supposing that he represents correctly on this sub-
ject the feelings and wishes of the regular Army.
What he considers a foul slander, they would hail,
if a reality, as a blessing What he eschews for
them in proud disdain, as an imputation on their
honor, they are urgently seeking I have seen
elaborate essays in the papers, vindicating their
claims to this very boon from Congress, and laBt
session the subject was brought before the Mili-
tary Committee, and is again at this session, I
understand, pressed on their consideration. A
huge wrong, truly, to imply that, die where they
may, in peace or war, in a barrack or on the battle-
field, their families aie provided for' A grievous
slander to suppose that the regulai Army is put
on the same footing with the militiaand the Navy,
in the kind beneficence of this Government' Sir,
if the report is erroneous in malting such asser-
tions, it has put forth neither a slander nor a wrong.
It states only what ought to be, if your present
legislation is to continue Why should an excep-
tion be made of the regular Army, in either your
justice or folly? Is it less useful, or patriotic, or
brave, than the militia or Navy ? I hesitate rot to
say, that unless you repeal your acts by which
your pension system has been extended to the
families of those who die neither of wounds, nor
in battle, in your militia and naval service, you
are bound to extend these provisions to the regular
Aimy Sir, I go a step further—on the same
principle, you are bound to extend your system
to all who die in your service, either in the civil
or military departments of the Govern ment What
is the difference between the case of a soldier who
dies in a time of profound peace quietly in a bar-
rack, without perhaps having even seen the smoke
of an enemy's camp, and that of a clerk who dies
in your service, in any of your bureaus ? Indeed,
the poor clerk may have worked harder at a more
unhealthy occupation, and probably for far less
compensation You are bound to carry out the
principle, if just, fairly to all. In my opinion, the
principle of your whole pension system is wrorg
It sprung from a vicious state of your Treasury,
resulting from the still more vicious principle of
the protective policy, and has not one particle of
justice or patriotism to support it. Neither the
soldier nor the civil officer is exempted from the
common fatality of death, and he knows when he
enters into the service of the Government what it
requires him to perform,and the compensation he
is to receive. He enters it voluntarily, and volun-
tarily he can leave it when he pleases In private
life, who would think himself bound to support
the families of all who die in his employment5
And what would be thought ofa Legislature which
should pass a law imposing such an obligation on
individuals' The wildest agranamsm never ad-
vanced a proj'ect so fatal to the rights of property
and individual independence Yet that which is
the silliest extravagance, or the most flagrant in-
iquity, when enforced on individuals, becomes
patriotism, and justice, and honor, when enforced
on the people.
The next error the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia has detected m the report, is an error of omis-
sion merely The committee does not state, as he
supposes they ought to have done, that the Navy
pension fund originated from prizes taken during
the last war, and contributions from the officers
and seamen. It merely speaks of this fund as
one over which Congress has extended its legisla-
tion, and destroyed by its unwise provisions Sir,
are we to presume that this body knows nothing'
Ignorant as we may be, m the estimation of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, are we to suppose
the Congress of the United States to be still more
ignorant'   Must we mention everything, at the
