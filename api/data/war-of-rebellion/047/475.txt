GENERAL: It is quite possible, from the reconnaissance of the enemy last night, that an attempt may be made to carry Fort Sumter by assault to-night, for which all your batteries must be prepared.

Respectfully,

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First Military District, Sullivan's Island:

GENERAL: Your note of yesterday, announcing that another flag of truce had been received at Battery Marshall, has been received, and I am instructed to call, thought you, for an explanation from the commanding officer there why that flag was not declined, in pursuance of express orders to that effect contained in a letter from these headquarters, dated October 22, 1863, addressed to Brigadier-General Clingman. Thus far all instructions from these headquarters relative to flags of truce appear to have been disregarded or ignored at Battery Marshall.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
