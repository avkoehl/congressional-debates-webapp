I REMAINED HERE UNTIL 10 O'CLOCK ON THE 5TH, WHEN I MARCHED, AND ARRIVED AT CREAGERSTOWN AT 10 O'CLOCK THE SAME EVENING. MARCHED FROM CREAGERSTOWN AT 9 A. M. THE 7TH, AND ARRIVED AT MIDDLETOWN, VIA FREDERICK CITY, AT 10 P. M. ON THE 9TH, I MOVED FORWARD TO BOONSBOROUGH, WHERE TWO MORE OF MY BATTERY WERE DETACHED-CAPTAIN MARTIN'S (SIXTH INDEPENDENT NEW YORK) BATTERY TO GENERAL GREGG, SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, AND LIEUTENANT HEATON'S BATTERY (B AND L, SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY) TO GENERAL BUFORD, FIRST DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS. THESE TWO BATTERIES HAVE BEEN ON DUTY WITH THESE DIVISION SINCE THAT TIME, AND MAKE THEIR REPORTS TO THESE HEADQUARTERS. HAVING BUT ONE BATTERY REMAINING WITH ME, BY DIRECTION OF GENERAL PLEASONTON I REPORTED TO GENERAL TYLER TO ASSIST HIM WITH THE ARTILLERY RESERVE SHOULD IT BE CALLED INTO ACTION, AND REMAINED WITH IT UNTIL OUR ARRIVAL AT BERLIN ON JULY 15, WITHOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING WORTHY OF NOTE. ON THE 16TH, LIEUTENANT WILLISTON, COMMANDING BATTERY D, SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY, AND LIEUTENANT KING, COMMANDING BATTERY A, FOURTH U. S. ARTILLERY, EACH WITH FOUR LIGHT 12-POUNDER GUNS, WERE ASSIGNED TO MY BRIGADE, AND ORDERED TO BE EQUIPPED AS HORSE ARTILLERY. HORSES WERE PROCURED AT BERLIN ON JULY 19, BUT EQUIPMENTS COULD NOT BE OBTAINED AT THAT PLACE. WITH THE THREE BATTERIES, WILLISTON'S KING'S AND DANIELS', I MARCHED FROM BERLIN AT 6 P. M. JULY 19, AND ARRIVED AND ENCAMPED NEAR WARRENTON, VA., ON THE 25TH, WITHOUT ANYTHING TRANSPIRING WORTHY OF NOTE. ON THE 30TH, THE LAST OF THE EQUIPMENTS WERE RECEIVED FOR THE TWO LIGHT 12-POUNDER BATTERIES, AND ON THE 31ST THEY WERE COMPLETED AND READY FOR ACTIVE FIELD SERVICE. GREAT CREDIT IS DUE TO FIRST Lieutenant J. H. BELL, OF THE SIXTH NEW YORK CAVALRY (THE ONLY OFFICER ON MY STAFF), FOR THE EFFICIENT MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF ACTING ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, ASSISTANT COMMISSARY OF SUBSISTENCE, AND ACTING ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER, NOT ONLY IN PROCURING HORSES AND SUPPLIES OF AL KINDS FOR THE BATTERIES WHICH WERE HELD IN RESERVE, BUT ALSO FOR PROCURING AND FORWARDING HORSES AND OTHER SUPPLIES TO THOSE ON DUTY WITH THE DIFFERENT CAVALRY DIVISIONS.

VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

J. M. ROBERTSON,

CAPTAIN SECOND U. S. ARTILLERY, COMMANDING BRIGADE.
