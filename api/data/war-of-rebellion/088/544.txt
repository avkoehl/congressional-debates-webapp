GENERAL: The following intercepted message is respectfully forwarded:

Colonel BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A brigade of infantry drawn up in line on Gilliam's farm, left resting on Red Bluff. I think they only camped there for the night. Stragglers constantly passing Broadway road toward City Point; a few passing pontoon to Prince George side. I am led to believe there was a considerable movement of troops during the night. All the tents, except three on or near open space to left of Cobb's, have disappeared.

LATER.-The brigade has taken up line of march toward Petersburg. It is composed of five regiments. Stragglers passing open space going toward Petersburg. It is composed of five regiments. Stragglers passing open space going toward front in Chesterfield. Gun-boat above pontoon.

STILL LATER.-Eleven regiments passing open space, going toward Cobb's from front in Chesterfield. They were followed by nine wagons, guarded by infantry. A new camp near the pontoon has just been struck. Troops coming toward Bermuda Hundred. Thirteen regiments just passed pontoon, going toward Prince George side; think they are the same that passed open space, except two regiments which came from the camp. These troops were followed by fifty-eight ambulances and seventy-one wagons, straggling guards of infantry and cavalry. Four pieces of artillery came from front in Chesterfield; passed open space going toward pontoon. The troops before reported are now passing Broadway road to Petersburg.
