MISSISSIPPI seems free from enemy or danger. State forces now in field will insure security. Forrest and corps can act elsewhere. Have ordered railroad from Tupelo, via Corinth and Grand Junction, to Jackson repaired; in few weeks work may be done. Raid from Sherman's army not moving toward Alabama. No news from Mobile. Enemy moving troops up and down the MISSISSIPPI River. General Taylor expected here this evening.
