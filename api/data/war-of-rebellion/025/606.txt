lose his services, as you anticipate, it is not deemed necessary to supply his place by the appointment of a citizen. Some officer can be selected who will be ordered to report to you for that purpose.

He also instructs me to say that there is no general order on the subject of impressment of negro labor. In some special cases, where the public exigencies demanded it, negro labor has been impressed, discriminating, however, against all hands employed in the production of cotton. Should an extreme case occur you are authorized to exercise this power. The exercise of such a power, however, should be abstained from if possible.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT, Number 74. Tupelo, June 17, 1862.

The general commanding takes pleasure in calling the attention of the armies of this department to the gallant conduct of Captain B. B. McCaa, and his command of Brewer's cavalry regiment on the morning of the 14th instant, when by a bold and dashing charge he put to flight a superior force of the enemy's cavalry. In this affair Private John Graham was especially distinguished, and will be rewarded with the badge of honor on some suitable occasion.

This success should teach our cavalry forces what they can accomplish by bravery and daring, and should incite them to like deeds of valor.

By command of General Beauregard:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Acting Chief of Staff.
