Halleck; also copy of yours to General Thayer. Captain Carr has received a dispatch from Colonel Myers saying the two quartermasters of Fort Smith are in the Department of Arkansas, and has given them the necessary orders so that there may be no more controversy.

Nothing has been heard of the Ninth Kansas Cavalry. The bushwhackers are quite active in the vicinity of Ozark, Clarksville, and Dardanelle. I think General Kimball will send part of the Third Arkansas to Dardanelle, with a field officer to command that post. One battalion, 400 men, of the Twelfth Michigan Infantry, under Colonel Graves, arrived day before yesterday; the second battalion will be here to-day or to-morrow. Colonel Graves will have 950 men when they get here.

Colonel Townsend, assistant adjutant-general at Washington, telegraphs under date of April 1 that the Fifty-fourth Illinois will be retained in that State for a few days. There can be no doubt but that the Third Iowa has gone to Vicksburg. Colonel Ryan, who returned from the North night before last, says a large number of Western troops are being sent to the Potomac. I sent a copy of Colonel Clayton's dispatch to General Halleck.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

APRIL 4.

P. S.-Nothing new to-day. The prisoners from Pine Bluff have just arrived. It is rumored that MacRae is about to make a raid on Devall's Bluff. I think Geiger is prepared for him.
