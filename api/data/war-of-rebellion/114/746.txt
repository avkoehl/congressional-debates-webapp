I was again disappointed, and although every part of that obligation was strictly observed on my part the authorities at Washington were not so scrupulous in observing their part of the undertaking and I was again arrested on the 17th of September, at Frederick, and from that time to the present I have been in close confinement as a political prisoner outside of the limits of my State and the jurisdiction of the courts having cognizance of any charge that could have been made against me. I deem it unnecessary to detail to you the many privations, hardships and sufferings that I have borne in my own person, or those which have been inflicted upon a helpless family during this long imprisonment which has deprived them of their protector and exposed them to outrages and insults of the most disgraceful character.

By Executive Order Numbers 2, bearing date the 27th of February, 1862, and signed by you as published in the newspapers I observe that General John A. Dix and Honorable Edwards Pierrepont were appointed "to examine the cases of the State prisoners remaining in the military custody of the United States, and to determine whether in view of the public safety and the existing rebellion they should be discharged or remain in military custody, or be remitted to the civil tribunals for trial," and I understand from the published account of their proceedings that they have entered upon and make some progress in the duty thus assigned to them.

The term Government as used in the parole is unauthorized by the Constitution or by any act of Congress passed prior to the late extra session that I am aware of, consequently of doubtful signification and may be construed into a pledge that I will give no aid or comfort to any person in any of the States still adhering to the Union who may differ, the mode of supporting and carrying on the war or the terms upon which it shall be closed.

My arrest was calculated to throw a cloud of suspicion over my character and the numerous publications made in the newspapers reflecting on myself and the political prisoners generally which I was not permitted to correct or contradict have increased that suspicion and no doubt left the impression upon the minds of many persons that I had committed some grave offense against the laws of my country which rendered me unfit for the society of my fellow-men and justified this severe and unusual treatment; and now that the agents appointed by the President for that purpose after full examination "ex parte and in a summary manner" of all the evidence and charges against me have determined that there is nothing to justify them in "remitting me to the
