CAPTAIN: I have just seen W. N. Craig, sheriff, who saw Lieutenant Woodin, C. S. Army, who left Franklin, N. C., yesterday morning, and the intelligence thus received is that one Columbus Zackery, with about 40 persons, came within 15 miles of Franklin, and that was the extent of the hostile forces of which there was any account at Franklin, or in its vicinity, yesterday morning.

I am, with much respect, yours, truly,

JAS. J. NORTON,

Captain and Enrolling Officer, Pickens District, S. C.

P. S.- Just as I finished the above note I received the inclosed penciling from Lieutenant Woodin, in reply to the note of inquiry sent by me to Walhalla, S. C., this morning, varying slightly from the foregoing statement.

WALHALLA, S. C., February 7, 1864.

Captain J. J. NORTON:

CAPTAIN: I went out yesterday with a scouting party to Mr. Beck's, 6 miles from Clayton. I saw home guards of Raiborn returning home. They had been down to Franklin. There has been no enemy within less than 15 miles of Franklin. They are supposed to be nothing but bushwhackers. The citizens of Franklin are all going back home again. There is no apprehension of any danger in that vicinity.

Yours, very truly,

C. H. A. WOODIN.
