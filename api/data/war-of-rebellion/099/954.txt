NEAR FALLING CREEK, March 22, 1865.

Major MAX WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I received last night from General Howard an order to move the trains this morning to Everettsville, and am pulling out early this morning. The roads are said to be bad. A brigade of the Twenty-fifth Army corps are here and will be in our rear. I apprehend no danger. No train has been started for Kinston yet, for the reason that there was no guard for it, and then Colonel Carpenter has not yet arrived with the empty wagons from the front. Everettsville will be on the way, however, and the empty part of the train can keep directly on.

I am, major, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. L. FORT,

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief Quartermaster, Fifteenth Army Corps.

The Second Brigade, Colonel Catterson commanding, was, by direction of Major-General Logan, very shortly afterward started out toward Bentonville on the Smithfield road, with a view to ascertaining the movements of the rebels. Passing beyond Mill Creek at Bentonville, Colonel Catterson soon met with the rear guard of the rebel column
