POLLARD, ALA.,

January 7, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE G. GARNER, Chief of Staff:

I sent you, in irons, 3 "peace men" last night. I will send you 70 tonight, nearly all of whom ought to be shot. I have bursted the institution. No man left last night. They are badly whipped. Please order Colonel Swanson's regiment back, that I may give them the grip and pass-word and purge it of all impurities. If it is not sent back, they will think we are afraid to have them here. Here is the place for them. Give them up to me, and I will do the Confederacy signal service, and in the spring wipe out their disgrace with blood upon the battle-field. They are completely subdued. They refused a fair fight which I tendered them yesterday with their guns loaded. The right leaders of Swanson's regiment are also in irons, and will be in Mobile to-night.

JAS. H. CLANTON,

Brigadier-General.

POLLARD, ALA.,

January 7, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE G. GARNER, Chief of Staff:

I will start 60 in a few from Gonzales, all of whom laid down their arms. It is necessary, for example, to do this, and best that if any of those are not excepted they should not return to the brigade, but be put to work on the fortifications for the war somewhere. I will start down Friday night with witnesses and charges. Please have irons ready for them, for effect, there.

JAS. H. CLANTON,

Brigadier-General.

POLLARD, ALA.,

January 7, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE G. GARNER, Chief of Staff:

Private Tulman, of Colvin's regiment, is said to be one of the ringleaders. Please have him arrested.

JAS. H. CLANTON,

Brigadier-General.

DALTON,

January 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

Clanton's troops should be dispersed and sent as far from home as practicable. This army is too near; that of Mississippi would be better, being farther and in the same command. Clanton's incompetency is proved by their condition.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MERIDIAN, MISS.,

January 31, 1864-6 p. m.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK:

I have just arrived at Meridian, and most respectfully request a short interview, at such hour as you may appoint, if consistent with you engagements.
