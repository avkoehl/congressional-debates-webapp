First Virginia Cavalry, of operations in front of Richmond during the Seven-days' Battles.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST VIRGINIA CAVALRY, Hanover Court-House, Va., August 1, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to report that the First Virginia Cavalry remained during the battles in front of Richmond under the immediate command of General J. E. B. Stuart and took part in all his operations.

The only casualty was the loss of Private R. P. Thomas, of Company A. He had been sent to the front, in company with Lieutenant Stewart, of Company B, to reconnoiter dismounted, when the came suddenly upon a large body of the enemy concealed in the woods. Refusing their demand to surrender, this party of two gathered up some abandoned loaded arms in the vicinity and fought bravely until Thomas was killed, when the lieutenant made his escape, the enemy not daring to pursue a soldier who had proved that he was not to be taken alive.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,FITZ. LEE,

Late Colonel First Va., Cav., Brigadier, General, Commanding Second Brigadier

Captain NORMAN R. FITZHUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Brigade.

On June 26 the regiment was on the Williamsburg road as a reserve.

A portion of the regiment being left along the enemy's lines to observe his movements, the remainder returned that day to camp.
