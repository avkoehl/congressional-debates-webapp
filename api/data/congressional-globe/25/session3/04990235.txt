25th Cong....3d Sess.
Interference in Elections—Mr. Calhoun,
Senate.
election impaired, it is they, and not we, who
must mainly suffei, and who of course aie the
best judges of the evil and the remedy If the
policy of the States demands it, they may impose
whatever restiamtthey please on the Federal offi-
ceis withm their respective limits, in Older to
guard against their control oi influence in elec
tions, and, if it be necessary, to divest them en-
tuely of the light of suffrage Tq those who are
so much more inteiested and competent to judge
and act on this subject than we aie, I am for
leaving the decision as to what ought to be done,
and the application of the remedy Entertaining
these views, I am forced to the conclusion that
this bill is unconstitutional, and if theie were no
other íeason to oppose its passage, would be com-
pelled to vote against it
But there aie others sufficiently decisive to
compel me to withhold my support, weie it pos-
sible te íemove the constitutional objection So
far from restricting the patronage ofthePresident,
should the bill become a law, it would, if I mis-
take not, greatly incieasehis influence He has
now the almost unlimited power of removing the
officers of this Government—a powei, the abuse
of which has been the subject of much and, in
my opinion, of just complaint on the part of the
Chamber to which the mover of this bill belongs,
on the ground that it wa3 calculated to mciease
unduly the power and influence of that department
of the Government Now what is the lemedy
this bill proposes for that evil? To put lestnc-
tions on the removing power ? The very reveise
To make it the duty, as it is now the light of the
President ¡o íemove, and in discharging this high
duty he is made the sole judge, without limitation
or appeal The fate of the accused would be ex-
clusively in his hand, whether chaiged with the
offense of opposing or supporting his admimstia
tion Can any one, the least conversant with
party morals, or the working of the human heal t,
doubt how the law would be executed > Is it not
certain that it would be most rigidly enforced
against all officeis who should vtntuie to oppose
him, either in the Federal oi State Governments,
with a corresponding indulgence and lenity to-
wards those who suppoited him ' A single view,
without prolonging the discussion, will decide
Should thei e be a President of such exal ted vn tue
and patriotism as to make no disciimination be-
tween friend and foe, the law would be perfectly
useless, but if not, it would be mvde the pretext
foi indiscriminate íemoval of all who may refuse
to become his active and devoted partisans, and
it would thus piove eithei useless, oi woise than
useless
With the object which the mover of the bill
has in view, it seems to me he ought to tike the
very opposite course, and instead of mikmg it
the duty of the President to íemove, he ought to
impose restrictions on the power of removal, oi
to divest him entirely of it Place the office-
holdeis, with their yearly salaries, beyond the
reach of the Executive power, and they would,
in a short time, be a3 mute and inactive as this
bill proposes to make them Then voice, I piom-
lse, would then be scaicelv raised at elections, or
their persons be found at the polls
But suppose the immediate object of the bill
accomplished,and theoffice holdeisrendeiedper-
fectly silent and passive   it might even then be
doubted whether it would cause any diminution
in the influence of patronage over elections     It
would, indeed, gieatly reduce  the influence of
the office holders    They would become the most
insignificant portion of the community, as far as
elections were concerned     But just in the same
propoition as they might sink, the no less formid-
able corps of office-seekers would use in import- .
anee     The struggle for power between the ins
and the outs would not abate in the least in vio- I
lence oi intensity, by the silence or inactivity of l
the office-holdets, as the amount of pationage, |
the stake contended foi, would remain undimin-
ished     Both sides—those in and those out of j
ower—would turn from the passive and silent
ody of incumbents, and com t the favor of the
active corps thit panted  to  supplant them, ind
the lesalt would be an annual sweep of the foi mer,
after ev^iy election, to make loom to reward the
lattei,avl that on whichever side the scile of
victory might turn    The consequence would be
I
rotation with a vengeance The wheel would turn
round with such velocity that anything like a sta-
ble system of policy would be impossible Each
temporary occupant that might be thiown into
office by the whul, would seize the moment to
make the most of his good fortune before he might
be displaced by his successor, and a system (if
such it might be called) would follow not less cor-
rupting than unstable
With these decisive objections, I cannot give
my suppoit to the bill, but I wish it to be dis-
tinctly undei stood that, in withholding it, I neither
i etract nor modify any sentiment I have expressed
in relation to the patronage of this Government
I have looked over, since the commencement of
this discussion, the report I made as chairman of
a select committee on the sublet in 1835, and
which has been so frequently referred to in debate
by those on the opposite side of the Chamber,
and I find nothing which I would omit, if I had
now to draw it, but much which time and reflec-
tion would induce me to add, to strengthen the
grounds I then assumed There is not a sen-
tence in it incompatible with the views I have
presented on the present occasion
I might here, Mr President, terminate my re-
marks, as far as this bill is concerned, but as the
general question of pationage is at all times one
of importance undei our system of Government,
and especially so, in my opinion, at this present
juncture, I tiust that I shall be indulged in offer-
ing my opinion somewhat moie at laige in refer-
ence to it
If it be dcsnable to íeduce the patronage of the
Government, (and I hold it to be eminently so,)
we must stnke at the source—the root, and not
the blanches It is the only way that will not in
the end prove fallacious The main souice of
pationage may be found m the powers, the rev
cnuc, and the expenditures of the Government,
and the fu it and necessaiy step toioaids its i eduction
is toiestuct the powers of this Government uilhin,
tne i igid limits pi esci ibed by the Constitution Every
extension of its powers beyond would bung
within itscontiol subjects never intended to be
placed there, follow ed by increased pationage and
augmented expenditure and revenue
We must in the next place take care not to call
the acknowledged powers of the Government into
action beyond the limits which the common in
teicst may render necessaiy, nor to pei vert them
into means of doing what it was never intended
by the Constitution we should have the right to
do Of all the souices of power and influence,
prevention of the poweis of the Government has
provtd in piactice the most fiuitful and danger-
ous, of which oui political histoiy furnishes many
examples, especially in reference to the money
powei, as will appear in the couise of my re
maiks
Aftei íestncting the powers of the Government
withm proper limits, the next important step
would be to bung down the income and expend
ltures to the smallest practicable amount It is a
primary maxim undei our system, to collect no
more money than is necessaiy to the economical
and constitutional wants of the Government We
have, in fact, no light to collect a cent moie I
Nothing can tend more powei fully to corruptpub
he and pnvate motáis, or to increase the pation-
age of the Government, than an excessive or sur
plus revenue, as lecent and sad experience has
abundantly pioved Nor is it less important to
restnct the expenditures within the income It
is, in fact, indispensable to a restucted revenue,
as the increase of the former must, in the end,
lead to an increase of the latter Ñor must an
exact administration, and a rigid accountability,
in every department of the Government, be neg-
lected It is among the most efficient means of
keeping down patronage and corruption, as well
as the revenue and expendnuies, just a  the op
posite is among the most prolific source of both
It is thus, and thus only, that we can reduce
effectually the patromge of the Government, to
the least amount consistent with the dischaige of
the few, but impnitant duties, with winch it is
chaiged, and rendti it what the Constitution in
tended it should be, a cheap and simple Govern
ment, instituted by the States  for then mutual
secun'y, and moie perfect piottction of their lib
eity and tianquillity     It is the way pointed out I
by Jeffeison and his associates of the Virginia
school, which has ever been distinguished for its
jealous opposition to patronage, as the bane of
our political system, as is so powei fully illus-
trated in the immoital documents so frequency
referí ed to in this discussion—the leport to the
Virginia Legislature on the alien and sedition law,
in the yeai 1799
But theie is, and ever has been, from the first,
another and opposing school, that regaided pat-
ronage with a very different eye, not as a bane,
but as an essential ingredient, without which the
Government would be impracticable, and whose
leading policy is, to enlist in its favor the more
powerful classes of society, through their interest,
as indispensable to its support. If we cannot
take lessons from this school, on the question of
reduction of patronage, we may at least loarn,
what is of vast importance to be known, how and
by what means this school has reared up a sys-
tem, which has added so vastly to the powei and
patronage of the Government, beyond what was
contemplated by its frameis, as to alaim its
wisest and best fuends for its fate With the
view of furnishing this infoimation, so intimately
connected with the object of these remarks, I pio-
pose to give a very brief and rapid narrative of
the rise and piogiess of that system
At the head of this school stands the name of
Hamilton, than winch theie is none more distin-
guished in our political history He is the pei-
fect type and impersonation of the national or
Fedeial school, (I use paity names with reluct-
ance, and only for the sake of brevity,) as Jeffer-
son is of the State-rights Republican school.
They were both men of eminent talent, ardent
patnotisni, great boldness, and compiehensive
and systematic understanding They were both
men who fixed on a single object far ahead, and con-
verged all their powers towards its accomplish-
ment The difference between them is, that Jeffer-
son had more genius,Hamilton more abilities, the
formei leaned more to the side of liberty, and his
great i ival more to that of power They both have
impressed themselves deeply on the movements
of the Government, but as yet Hamilton far more
so than Jefferson, though the impression of the
latter is destined in the end, as I trust, to prove
the more duiable of the two
It has been the good fortune of the school of
which Mr Jeffeison is the head to embody their
principles and doctnnes in written documents,
(the report íeferred to and the Virginia and Ken-
tucky íesolutions,) which are the acknowledged
creed of the party, and may at all times be re-
fined to in o del to asceitain what they are in
fact 1 he opposite school has left no such written
and aiknowlcd^ed creed, but the declaration and
acts of its gieat lcadei have left little doubt as to
eithei its principlcsordoctiines In tiacing them
a narrative of his life and acts need not be given
It will suffice to say that he entered early in life
into the army of the Revolution, and bectme a
member of the mihtaiy family of Washington,
whose confidence he gained and retained to the
1 i«,t He next appealed in the Convention which
fnmed the Constitution, where, with his usual
boldness, he advocated a Picsident and Senate
for lite, and the appointment by tlnsGoveinmcnt
of the Governoiso,'the States, with a veto on the
State laws These bold measures fi ling, he re-
tired fiom the Convention, it is slid, in disgust,
but ifiei wards, on more mature reflection, beeamo
the zealous and able advocate of the adoption of
the Constitution He saw, as he thought, in a
scheme of Government which confened the un-
limited power of taxing and declaring vvai, the
almost unbounded source of power in resolute
and able hands hence his declaration that, though
the Government was weak in its organization, it
would,when put in action,find the means of sup-
posing itself, a piofound íeílection, piovingth it
he cleiuly saw how to make it, in piactice, what
his movements in the convention had failed to ac
comphsh in Us organization
Nor has he left it in doubt as to what were the
means on which he relied to effect Ins object
We all recollect the fimous asseition of the eldei
Adams, that the " Bntish Constitution, 'itstoied
to its ouginal principles, and need fiom torrup

and Hamilton's reply, that the Bntish Constitu-
