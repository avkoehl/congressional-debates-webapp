fled in the greatest confusion. The loss of the enemy was here very great, his dead lying upon the field by the hundred. Nothing but the exhausted condition of the men prevented them from carrying the heights. As it was, with no support of fresh troops, and with the knowledge that the enemy was pouring re-enforcements from their right into the ledges of the mountain, it was found impracticable to follow him farther. In this charge, large numbers of prisoners taken by men of this command were sent to the rear, but no guards were kept over them specially, and impossible now to ascertain the number. The regiment retired with the line to the ravine, and went into bivouac for the night, the pickets of the brigade holding the field. The rout of the enemy was manifested in the fact that no attempt was made to follow our retreat, and scarcely any effort to annoy us in retiring. The regiment lost many valuable officers and men. Among the killed are Captain M. T. Nunnally H; Captain John W. Stokes, Company B, and First Lieutenant W. Holmes Baskin, Company K, L who fell gallantly at their posts. A complete list of the casualties is herewith transmitted. *From this it appears that the number of killed was 23, of wounded 171, and of missing 5; total, 204 [199?]. I take pleasure in; testifying that the behavior of officers and men was satisfactory and worthy the proud name heretofore won by the troops of this army.

I am, your obedient servant,

HENDRY D. McDANIEL,

Major, Commanding Eleventh Georgia Regiment. Captain

CHARLES C. HARDWICK, A. A. G; Anderson's Brigade. July 8, 1863.

Major: I have the honor to report the part borne by the detachment of Andersto's brigade under my command in the affair of the 3rd instant, between portions of Hood's division and the enemy's cavalry. The Eleventh Georgia and Fifty -ninth Georgia(Captain[M. G.]Bass), under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Luffman, were ordered to repel an attempt of the enemy's cavalry to reach the rear of the army by turning the right flank of Hood's division. Lieutenant-Colonel Luffman was forced by illness to relinquish the command before the detachment reached the scene of action. Assuming command, I placed the Eleventh Georgia under command of Captain William H. Mitchell. The detachment, guided by Brigadier-General Law (commanding Hood's division) in person, reached the flank just as the enemys' dismounted cavalry had succeeded in turning the same, driving our cavalry force before them. Under the direction of Brigadier-General Law, I ordered a charge with the entire force, with was promptly made. The enemy was repulsed with loss, and driven in confusion several hundred yards to a point far beyond our flank, before endangered. A number of prisoners fell into our hands; how many, I have not now means to ascertain, as they were immediately sent to the rear. Being ordered by Captain [L. R.] Terrell, of Brigadier-General Law's staff, to stop the pursuit, and recall my command to a fence on the extension of the line of the division, I did so, and sent a small force of skirmishers to the front.
