Washington, April 17, 1862.

Brigadier-General ROSECRANS,

Winchester:

I have received no information of you plans. Blenker's division is assigned to Fremont's command, and no part of it ought to be diverted from that object. Your instructions do not authorize any change of its destination. The Paymaster-General will be directed to make immediate payment. I expected you would have gone forward and superintended its movements until it came within Fremont's command. The Quartermaster-General has instructions for supplies.

Secretary of War.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 17, 1862.

In a military point of view I have no doubt of its superior advantages, but I understand that all Blenker's command is to move to Moorefield with the least possible delay, and am taking steps to conduct them accordingly. As I telegraphed the Secretary they are without any kind of shelter, and now without provisions.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

I never fear of your cipher telegram until to-day, and I deeply regret that you did not follow my instructions. I hope you will now see that the division is placed in its proper command, as I directed in the first instance.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Provision train, Blenker's command, except the rear guard, are bivouacked this side of the Shenandoah. I come into telegraph office. You will find I have taken the wisest and most expeditious course to
