Major-General SHERMAN:

I have heard nothing from Decatur since 11. 30 last night. The telegraphic communication is open, but I can get nothing from General Granger, although I have repeatedly asked him for information.

CHATTANOOGA, October 29, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The following has just been received from Decatur, dated October 29,4. 40 p. m.:

I told you we drove the rebs out of their rifle-pits yesterday, capturing 120. In the evening we made another sortie, spiking a couple of gund, and making 14 more prisoners. In this skirmish we lost 40 killed and wounded. Our loss altogether up to this time amounts to 80. We blew up 4 caissons and dismounted 2 pieces of artillery. We killed and wounded a very large number of the enemy, full 500. About 4 o'clock this morning they began to leave in the direction of Courtland. I have been probing them at different points all day, finding them in force, until 4 o'clock this evening, when our forces carried their last line of rifle-pits. Enemy evidently believed us to be in very strong force here, judging from what their prisoners have stated. I have endeavored to keep up this impression. I am picketing the river with all the cavalry in my possession, down to the mouth of Elk River. If gunboat returns, now some miles up river, I will send a regiment down the river to Brown's Ferry. Negroes who escaped from them and prisoners say that Hood and Beauregard are both with them. Received a dispatch from Athens which stated that two couriers from Florence reported that the enemy had crossed below Florence at Cypress Creek in large force. I think this information is to the same effect as that forwarded by General Croxton. It will hardly be necessary now to report, anyhow. I will send you, however, all the information I can obtain.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully,

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

I have your dispatch about Decatur. All right. I want to know the first moment Beauregard crosses to the north of the Tennessee. I think he must get supplies from the Mobile and Ohio road before he advances far into Tennessee.

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 29, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Just received the following* dated Decatur, October 29,9. 30 p. m.:

I have conversed with a number of deserters, prisoners, and escaped negroes, and from their information I am led to believe it is the impression among the officers and men of Hood's army that they are bound to get into Middle Tennessee. The deserter who just left me says that their first aim was to take this place, and fully expected
