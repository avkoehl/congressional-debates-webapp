Found it difficult to restrain the men from continuing the chase. The remainder of the day was spent in following up the routed enemy, with the brigade much of the time under a shell fire.

Casualties: Killed-commissioned officers, 2; enlisted men, 5; total, 7. Wounded-commissioned officers, 3; enlisted men, 60; total, 63. Missing-enlisted men, 1.*

In regard to the conduct of officers and men I have to report that all did so well that it would be hardly consistent to particularize-always obeying orders. But I must mention Lieutenant-Colonel Peck, who labored hard to keep the line steady, and received his death wound in the saddle. His death is a severe and irreparable loss to the regiment. Lieutenants Bulkley and Steadman were brave and efficient officers, and men of unimpeachable moral character. Captain J. D. Roche, Company K, under arrest, volunteered for the day. He behaved nobly. He is generally a valuable officer.

The dry grass in our front caught fire during the engagement, thereby endangering our position; a volunteer was called for to put it out; Corpl. Augustine Gray, Company C, did the hazardous duty.

SIR: I have the honor to report the following as the part taken by this regiment in the engagement at Fisher's Hill on the 22nd instant:

About 4 a. m. the regiment, with the brigade, was moved from its position near Strasburg to the right, taking up a new position on an hundred men, detailed the night before, were on the left of the picket line near Strasburg, under command of Captain De Forest. They were constantly skirmishing with the enemy. At 10 a. m. I was detailed as field officer of the day and assigned to the part of the line where our detachment was posted. I left the regiment in command of Captain S. H. Granniss, Company B. All was quiet in the regiment the remainder of the day until the advance was ordered, when the regiment moved with the brigade, but orders being given by General McMillan for Captain Granniss to report to me at Strasburg, they proceeded no farther in that direction. The regiment arrived at junction of Manassas Gap Railroad and Strasburg pike about 7 p. m., went into bivouac after relieving the detachment, who had then been on the skirmish line over twenty-four hours. About 9 p. m. I received orders to withdraw our pickets and rejoin the brigade then in close pursuit of the enemy; moved from our place of bivouac at 10 p. m.; marched all night. The line of march being difficult and toilsome, the road blockaded by artillery, wagon-trains, and stragglers, we made but slow progress. We joined the brigade about 4.30 a. m. the next day.

No casualties occurred during the day in the regiment.

Captain, Comdg. Twelfth Regiment Connecticut Vol. Infantry.
