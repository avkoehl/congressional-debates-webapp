pfcned the} were n< t receded, vvnich explana-
tions, having been delated bj accident, were sub-
sequently given to it.
The conduct of this ExtraordinaiyEnvoy is also
alleged to hive been conformable to diplomatic
usage, and two instances are brought forwa-d to
sancfon this al'egation, assumed to exist in. the
history of the chp'ormcj of the United States It
is asserted in the note of Mr Maitmez that the
Commissioners of ihe United States published their
correspondence pending the negotiation at Ghent
During a war with Great Britain, the coiresspon-
dence of the Commiss.ion rs of Great Britain and
the United Slates, who were nego'i > ing teimsof
peace, was p ihlished in "Washington b} the Go-
vernment of the Un'ted States there were no libels
in it upon Great Britain The Commissioners of
the United States ne er published an} thing during
the negotiation ai Ghent
The Chairé d'Affaues of Trance pnbl shed a
lettei of mstructii ns from Ihe Duke de Broglie m
some of the journals of ihe United States, in Eng-
lish TheieHcr of the Duke de Brcglie «as not a
libel upon the Government of the Uniled States,
but Us publication vas considere^ improper bv ill
paities m this countrj By «hat mea is the Mexi-
can Government has been imposed upon, and in-
duce 1 to as-eitthat "Mr Sec etirj i\ r^v th wrote
to Paris representing lhat this Government would
not object to receive again, as a diplomatic agent
the Charge d'Affures n ho had caused that publica-
tion a few months b< tore," it is impi ssible to con-
jecture It is a sheer fabric-it on, vvhich «id b  seen
with astonishment by the Governments of Fng-
land and of Fiance, to «horn all th" encu nstarces
of the transaction to which it rtlaics aie as per-
fectly well known as they aie to the Government of
the Un.ted S'ale*
The relati ins of the Unite 1 St t an ' Mexico,
therefore, as the\ no  stand are thesj The demand
of the United States lor justice for past injuries
has been mide in conformity w ith the ir^alj be-
tween the twonattons, but apparently no public com-
plaint has since been examined by the Mexican
Government, except the conduct of Mr Gorostiza
The printing and distribution of his offensive pam-
phle is approved b} his Government, and justified
as conformable to what was required by its dignity
and mteiests
To the o'her demands of a public nature existing
at the adjournment of the la't annual sission oí
Congress, aftei five months' delav, no answe has
been given On three cases of private chims pie-
sented for fina! answer, an^vveis have been given
The justice of two of them is denied, alihou<di one
of them rests on a decree of the Mexican Govern-
ment Satisf ic ion lar the one admitted to be just
is not made The Congress of Mexico, v ho hive
been consideimg thesuo|ect for eight or ten icars,
will be "incited  to pass upor it, vv hen thev mee'
Since the last session of C mgiess an embargo
Irs been bid on Amer can vessels in the ports of
Mexio Vthoiiphiiised, n satisfaction has been
made, or offered, for the iesultir¿ injuries
Our merchant vessels have been captured for dis-
regarding a pi "tended blockade of Texis, vesse's
and cargoes set íet'v proceeded a°a nst in the Mex-
ican tr ►un tls, c in 'emned and said, the captains,
ciews, and passengers of the captured vessel  haves
been imprisoned awl plundered of th°n property}
and, a'ter enduring insults and injuries, have b en|
released without remuneration oi apology Fot}
these acts no reparation has been promised, noi ex-
planations given, although satisfaction was, m genj
eral terms, demanded in Jul} la^t
Prom these facts a judgment may be formed oj
the value of the assurances that hav e been receive*
fiom the Mexican Government, and the probability
of their ever being fulfilled                                  j
Copies of all the correspondence with the Mexil

To the President of the United States,
REPORT  OP  THE SECRETARY OP WAR
Depirtmftt of War, ?
December % 1837,    j"
Sir In ci mpliance with }our instructions, and in
c n'oimitj with established usage to present an-
nua ly lo vou, forthe information ol Oongie«s, a
stlament of the transactions of thi> Department,
together with such suggestions in relation to the
various subjects under its administration as the
pub'ic interests may seem to require, I have the
honor to submit the following report
It will be seen bv the statement of the Com-
manding General, that the principal part of the
regular forces has been drawn from the posls on the
frontiers and concentrated in riouda, and his ac-
count ot the military transactions m that Terri'ory
will exhibit the progress of the war to the clo>e
of the last, and the events attending the commence-
ment of the present, campaign The proposals
made by the Indians to submit to ti^e fins ol the
treaty, and the negotiations entered into with them
to this effect, caused the cessation of hostilities at a
penoi when thev m ght have betn cani d on to
aovantagf
This measure on the part o* the Genc-il co ,1-
mindn« the auny cf tic ^autb, although pr dec-
ay of del?, and increased expense, was dutdiel
bj human t\ and a laudable desire to avoid, if
practicab'c, the m cessity ol hnther enforcm- , b)
arms, the execution ot the treat} and «as apprived
by the Dtpir ment Nor can any just biame be
attached to the conduct of that officer foi keeping
his faitn with the Indians, and rather sufltring
himself to be deceived by them than to v iolate his
eng igemenls by securing the chi< ts who bal en-
tered his camn and placed tht rnsflves in his pov T,
under the p'edge of receiving his pi dee lion
The enemv proved failhlcss, and the s*m on lm
aotive oppntnns passed awj without anv 11 port-
ant resit't- Gieat expen e « is incurred in prepa-
rations for the removal of the Indians, which thei-
treachery rendered abortive, but the honor of the
Government, which s beyond all pnce, vas pre-
served, and it is satu>faetorv to knovi tost th ¡e-
newal of hostilities has on1} taken place after eve-
i y effort had been tned m vain to persuade these
deluded people to submit peaceably to the execu-
tion of the law It is unnecessary to recapitulate
the circumstances which led to this war, the} aie
already «ell understood, but it maybe important to

transportation became still more expensive, as well

ces that our Indian allies have proved so useful.
Their peculiai sagacitj in detecting the stratagems.
of iheir r?ce, and the r untiring vigilance and ac-
tivity in the field, are thj best protection against
the ambuscades, night assaults, and surprises, which.
constitute the warfare of these tribes, and are so
han assmg and destructive to our troops. To the
sirong arms and brave hearts of our own men, we
may salely rely for victory in action, but we must
depend upon the Indian to detect the lurking place
