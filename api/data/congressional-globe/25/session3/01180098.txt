Mr. WISE said he was about to present a pe-
tition of rather a unique character. It had been
forwarded to him, and was addressed to the House
of Representatives. It came from one woman and
one man. ile could not say whether or not they
were joined together. Â«Their names were J. S.
White and Louisa Grosvenor, of Calais, in the
State of Maine. There was a seal upon the paper
also of a singular character. Stamped upon the
wax was the representation of a sheaf of wheat,
sitting on an end in a wheat field. The inscrip-
tion thereon was "you deserve a thrashing."
Mr.W. then went on to say that he enuld not tell
whether it was himself or others who were des-
ignated as deserving " the thrashing." Be that
as it might, the. prayer of the petition was that
the House would rescind its standing resolution
by which all abolition papers are laid upon the
table.
Mr W. then moved, in substance, that the pe-
tition be referred to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, with instructions to report
a resolution rescinding the "Athcrton resolu-
tions:" and more especially that portion of them
by which abolition papers are laid upon the table
on presentation; that the memorials already re-
ceived by the House and laid on the table, be
taken from the files of the House and returned to
the petitioners, and that in future all abolition me-
mos i.Us, of whatever character, be not received by
this House,
Mr. DROMGOOLE moved to lay the whole
subject on the table; but,
Mr. WISE intimating a desire to address the
House on the subject, the motion to lay on the
table was withdrawn.
The SPEAKER decided, however, that, a de-
bate arising, the resolution would lie over one day
under the rules.   It lies over accordingly.

olutions adopted by the House of Represent-
atives on the liith of December last, on motion
of Mr. Atiierton, of New Hampshire, in re-
spect to memorials and petitions relating to sla-
very. Mr. C said he was personally acquainted
with many of the persons whose names appear
on this memorial. They were of the most in-
telligent, substantial, and worthy citizens of
New York. Among them he recognized the name
of William Cullen Bryant, a gentleman whose
fame as an author, and whose learning and
ability as a political writer, are familiar to the
House and the country. Mr. Bryant, as editor
of one of the leading journals of the country, (the
New York Evening Post,) occupies a position of
much power and influence over the public mind.
Mr. C. was here called to order by Mr. Mor-
gan; but upon the declaration of Mr. C. that he
would not occupy the time of the House further
than to state the contents of the petition, which
he had a right to do under the rule, the Speaker
said Mr. C. was in order; and he proceeded to
say,that the petitioners denounced the resolutions
of the 12th of December as false in principle,
anti-republican in their character, utterly subver-
sive of all that is precious in the sacred right of
petition, alarming as a precedent, especially; to
be reprobated for the  unfounded imputation
which the resolutions cast upon the signers of
abolition memorials, in ascribing to them a de-
sign to " overthrow an institution of the several
States," and, above all, (said Mr. C.,) these me-
morialists complain of the resolutions because
they were passed under the spur of the previous
question, without time for consideration, discus-
sion, or debate. Mr. C. moved the reference of
the petition of Mr. Bryant and others to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the State of the Union.
Mr. C. also presented a memorial of William A.
