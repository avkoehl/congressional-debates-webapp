APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
£7th Cong-'-Ist Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Wtiler.
H. of Reps.
dicate a concurrence with him m sentiment on the part of
thepeople "
You have assumed, in despite of the facts presented, that this
question has been determined at the late election, and you now
demand that the Presidentshall carry out that decís on, notwith
standing his declartd opinions upon the subject Was John
Tyler elected as the friend of a National Bank' Where is the
man upon this floor who dares assert the fact! Sir, it is well
known that he has always been hostile to the measure In his
speech made m Congress m 1819, he took the highest ground oc
cupied by the Democracy, upon the subject of the currency
He then exposed, in the most masterly and eloquent manner,
the evi's inseparably connected with the banking system in this
country I have only tune to make a short extract from that
speech, which will show his views on the constitutional ques
tion
"Inasmuch as [ heheve the creation of this corporation to
be unconstitutional, I cannot, without a violation of my oath,
hesitate to repair this breach thus made in the Constitution,
whenever an opportunity presents itself of doing so without
a violation of the public faith believing, aleo that it is expe
dient to put it down "
He is now expected to abandon the ground taken In this speech,
and give his assent to this bilí, hecause the hopes of a distm
guished Senator, in reaching the Presidency, are identified with
this measure I am not aware of his having renounced any of
the opinions expressed m that speech, but, on the contrary,
when interrogated by his fellow citizens during the canvass, he
referred them to his speeches when in public life for hissenli
ments He was elected, Chen, with a full knowledge that he
considered a Bank unconstitutional and, if he adheres to th s
opinion, no one can complain that he has been deceived But,
for the preservation of the ' universal Whig party," you ask
him now to renounce his long cherished and often avowed opi-
nions, abandon the Republican friends with whom he has here-
tofore associated, and approve this bill'
And the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania [Mr  Sergeant) has
made an ingenious argument to show that, no matter what
the private opinion of the President may be, he ought if a
Bank bill   is   passed  by  Congress,  to  give  his assent to
it    The gentleman places him m the position of a marshal,
and says Suppose this office, was to refuse to execute a writ
issued by the court, because he considered the law under which
it was issued unconstitutional  would he be justified*   Why,
Mr   Chairman, does the gentleman suppose that the President
is so destitute of intellect as tobe deceived by such an argu
mentí   Can he expect by sophistry to conceal the ti ue question
from him?   I surely need not tell that gentleman that che mai
shal l  a mere ministerial officer, whose duty it is. to execute
the law, whilst the President by the Constitution is made a part
of the law making power of the Govei nment, having legisla
tiveQB wellas Executive duties to peiform     The second sec
tion of the seventh amele of the Constitution piovides "that
every bill which shall have passed tne House of Represen! i
tives and the Senace shall, befo e ic become a la,v,hepr seitel
to the President of the United States     11 he appiove°, he shall
sign H, but,ifnot, he shaU return it with his objections to that
House m which it originated, ' &c     Tim   ' . w 11 be seen chat
he has a constitutional agency in the enactment of laws as well
asm their execution    lhe case  then, are not similar, and no
ingenuity can make them so    The President has taken an oath
tosuppurtthe Constitution of tie United States, and if heap
proves tins bill, believing it to be unwarranted by thatmslru
ment, he stands convicted before the woild of perjury    isay,
sir, (for I wish to be distinctly understood,) thai Mi   J yler can
not, unlesshehaschanged his opinions and renou ced the doc
trines advocated in the speech fiom which 1 have quoted, sane
tion this bill without violating his oath    Wi.l lie disgrace him
self, Co accommodace any man*   I will believe it, sir, wbenl
see his name attached to this bill, ana not before     One wold
more on this point     If the President adheres to his old opi
nions, and at this critical moment saves the country from the
rum winch this measure must u imar^ly inflict upon it he
need not fear, he will hud himsel   sustained in the act by the
honest and patriotic freemen of this country    lie who in the
hour of danger, throws himself i a as a shield be ween his country
and rum—he who stnkes down the arm whichi  raiseltostao
the liberties of Che people—will noc be abandoned    The good
old Republicans of Che Jeffersonian school will hail him as che
deliverer of his country    God giant thathepiay have firmness
enough to meet the crisis'

An examination of this table will show how the farming inte-
rest was advanced by the old Barde It will be seen that the
average price of wheat was much lower duriüg the period
when the Bank was m full opeiation than after it ceased to
exist But, m the language of gen lemen on the otherside, was
the country "contented, prosperous, and happy"!" A few ex-
tracts from Niles's Register, for the years 1819 and 1820, will
be a sufficient answer to this question    In 1819
"From all pares of our country," says Mr Niles, "we hear
of a severe pressure on men in business, a general stagnation
of trade, a large reduction m the price of staple articles Real
property is rapidly depreciating in iji n nmnal value, and its
renes 01 profits areexceedmely diminishing Many highly re
spectable traders have become bankiupts, and it is agreed chat
many others must 'go,' the banksare lefusingtheir customaiy
accommodations, confidence among meichants is shaken, and
three per cent per month is offered lor the discount of promis
sory notes, which a little while ago were considered as good
as old gold,' and whose makers have not since suffered any
losses to render their notes-less valuab'e than heretofore "
Four months afterwards,hesays

' but weknow noc how tobelieve ic, thatcoin ia selling at ten,

Nlles appears afcerwaids tu have had other evidence sufficient
to overcome his incredulity foi he remarked on the 1" h of
September, 1820 "A gentleman m Western Viigmia directs

from regulating the exchanges and currency of the country, yo"
will find it engaged in the acquisition of political power. <3iv*
me che control of the currency of this country, and lean con-
trol its politics Such an institution as this bill creates, will,
in the hands of partisans, be used for political purposes, and
ls,mmy opinion, so designed by itsframers You know, Mr.
Chairman, that the party to which you belong, can never «•
tain its power without a corrupting moneyed institution of this
character, which can regulate the prices of the very food we
eat That the old bank was used for political purposes, is no
longer a disputed question In 1831 the present President of
the United Stales made a report to the Senate, which fully
shows the partisan character of that bank It is well known
that after General Jackson vetoed it 1111832, it entered the po-
htical field, and appropriated its funds liberally to secure his
defeat All che influence which its numerous branches, 11s
discounts, its hired orators and pensioned presses could exer-
cise, was biought into action The report shows that during
that year (1832; the bank expended eighteen thousand four
hundí ed and ninety dollars and seventy nine cents m the
printing and circulation of inflammatory speeches and pam-
phlets against him' Of this sum, $16 499 94 was expended in
the six months immediately preceding t/iat electwn More
thanaio// million of speeches (as the report shows) were
printed aid cnculated at the expense of the bank' And in
1834, while still struggling foi a charter, they circulated about
seven hundred thousand speeches denouncing GeneralJack-
son, at an expense of $26 284 01 I have ne means of ascer-
taining how much they paid for the writing and delivery of
thtst speeches, but the document now in my hand shows that
in 183' no less than forty four members of Congresewere in-
debted to the bank, and that the amount of their loans was
8478 069, being a hundred thousand dollars more than was
loaned to members during anyprevions orsubsequent year It
needs no labored argumenc to piove chat chis mscitution will be
what Alexander Hamilton proposed tne first bank should be—
a political machine, a maehme by which the action ofthe Go-
vernment can be controlled, and a moneyed aristocracy built
up inthiscountrv
You now propose giving to this institution the exclusive
power of manufactunngacunency for twenty years, to repeal
die Independent Treasury bill, and lestore the unholy connec-
tion between the Government and the banks. You constitute
the General Government a partner in this concern, deposite the
public money in its vaults, and make *he ¡solvency of theTrea-
sun depend upon the solvency of this institution If the Bank"
suspends or fails t te Government runs down, and the public
creditor remains unpaid Duiingthe last year, the public mo-
ney hasbeen collecttd, kept, and disbuised by officers of our
own who are pi evented, by the severest peralties, from using a
siog'e dol ar for their own private purposes Under that law,
I am 1 ot aware of the loss of a single dollar, nor have I heard
anyr.ianheiea'tempttoshr w che policy of its repeal You
lounged your 1 pposition to that bill tpon the ground that the
officers would abscond with the treasure of the people Well,
undei thisrhaitei, the public officers must collect the money
before it cat lie deposited m the bank, and if it was unsafe 111
the one cast, ic is equally so in the other In both instances,
the money passes through the hands of officers The time will
come when the people will demand che re-enactment of that
m ui 1. abused law- tho Sub Treasury

dens upon the people, ac a time when they aie least able to bear

free 01 duty jewellery, gold lace, and a hundred other articles
used, almost exclusively by the nch You have in this way, by
taxin' the tea and coffee ofthe poor man, provided a capital up-
on which the bankers under this bill can speculate And this is
the gi eat rrform about which you have said so much If these
acts 1 ecen e the sanction of the people, 1 fear the days of this
Republic (renumbered
I have now, Mr Chairman, dischaiged what I conceived to
be my duty As one of the sentinels upon the watch tower, I
have oeen compelled to soundthe alaim, and direct the attencion
of inv counCrymon to the impending daneer 1 have endeavored,
10 as b let a manner as possible, to awaken the public mind to

The people have the powei in their own lianas, and by a timely
and judicious exercise of it, the Republic may yet be saved.

Che hour of calm delibérale reflection will soon come and cor-
