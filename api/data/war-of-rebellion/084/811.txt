DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,

Santa Fe, N. Mex., August 22, 1864.

Captain NICHOLAS S. DAVIS,

First Infty. Colonel Vols., Upper Crossing of the Arkansas:

CAPTAIN: I am directed by the general commanding to say that Major Joseph Updegraff, U. S. Army, with 100 rank and file, starts in a few days for the Lower Cimarron Springs to remain there sixty days. He will be about sixty-five miles from the Upper Crossing of the Arkansas, where you are supposed to be. Should you need any help from him send to him for it. Asst. Surg. Harvey E. Brown, U. S. Army, with medicines and instruments, will be with him, and has been instructed to attend to the sick of your command if you can communicate with him. (See inclosed order.*) If you are hard pressed you can fall back on Updegraff, when the two commands united can make a sturdy fight; or, if expedient, he can come forward and join you and fight it out on that ground. I judge that you found water at Sand Cree, the Bone Yard, the Battle Ground, and in the Sand Hills. Send word to Updegraff about this, and the distance between points where water can be found, so that he can govern his marches accordingly in case he join you, which at a pinch he can do in thirty hours if there is any water at all on the route. Captain E. H. Bergmann, First New Mexico Cavalry, will be at or near the Upper Cimarron Spring with eighty cavalry and infantry. Give all the trains coming this way this information, that they may know where to find or send for succor. Either of the commands could whip any number of Indians likely to be met with, but, concentrated, could overwhelm all the Indians on the Arkansas in an open field fight.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. C. CUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,

Santa Fe, N. Mex., August 22, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Fort Union, N. Mex.:

SIR: The department commander directs that when Captain Bergmann arrives at Fort Union, for a scout of fifty days in the direction of the Cimarron, give him a good officer and thirty picked men of infantry to go with him and form a part of his command. Furnish Captain Bergmann with such subsistence, ammunition, and clothing as he may require, and see that he is fitted out in the most perfect order for active field service. Should it be necessary to draw any supplies from the ordnance department, say to Captain Shoemaker that the general commanding the department authorizes you to call on him for them. He will approve the requisition after the issue. The chief quartermaster will give directions about his transportation. The accompanying letter+ to Captain Bergmann will send to that officer by special express, should there be no regular expressman belonging to Fort Bascom about to return to that post.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. C. CUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
