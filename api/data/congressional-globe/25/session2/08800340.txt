be removed, and more fit and appropriate arrange-
ments made for the future better accommodation
of the Department This inquiry it is now among
the dutie«, and upon the responsibility, of this com-
mittee and of this House to decide
Yet, with all fhe«e causes of objection, the com-
mittee might still have hesitated in recommending
the demolition of the walls of the building, at the
consequent sacrifice of a heavy expeBditme, but foi
the admonition of another and more fatal defect,
whicli rendered the duty equally clear and impera-
tive The architects who were employed to exa-
mine the structure, have condemned the work as
deficient in the requisite strength and security.
This objection depends, upon pimciples of architec-
tural science, and a rightful application of the
rules of art Sir, I profess no judgment in this
matt-r above the skill and capacity, and fidelity of
the aiti ans, who have been witnesses, to the com-
mitt e, and whose opinio-1; accompany the report
If they are to be relied upon, and their judgment is
worthjjof any degree of confidence, here is an insu-
perable difficulty in the way of further proceeding
w ith ti e work The objection did not origínale
with the committee, nor is it obvious to an} super-
ficial an 1 unpractised obseivation I take occa-
sion, m parsing, here to say, that the representations
of die architect of the building, m his appeal to the
House, if they intended to apply to m> associates
or mysel', aie unfunded and unjust in this paiti-
cuhi The committee have nowhere asserted that
oí wlich he complains The) hive at no time
made or given countenance to a suggestion that
"the ¿rene-, hid alieady cracked," that "the walK
werefiUttns," or that "(he building was already
crumbling into rums, " These are the imaginings
of a j'aloiib spun, the cob house faoncation of an
an i ci r « In builds but to show his. vkiil on what
he ma) i io-> t_,iMly destioy. The opinions of the
nribiko's, Alessrs Walter and Pams, are the war-
íant to the committee for the impeachment of the
strength of the work To this point their language
is so unequivocal and decisive, that I must crave
the patience of gentlemen while I read some brief
extiacts from iheir reports
' 1 he second objection advanced (says Mr Walter) is the
weakness ofthesli icture My derided opinion m reltrence to

This, Mr Chairman, let it be borne in mind, is
the hngu-Jge of a professional architect, addressed
t re ( o i mttee on the Public Buildings, upon the
responsibility of his character, and the high obliga-
tion to fidelity in, the execution of a trus  commit-
ted by them to his skill and judgment There is
nothing doubtful or equivocal, either in the descrip-
tion he gives of the v,ork, or the condemnation
vhich he pronounces upon it If there be error
in either, it boldly challenges correction Nor is he
less explicit in his objections to other parts of the
work
" A lother defect is evident (says he) in the vaul ing of the
ves i u e on 15 h s teet these arches are all groined, and
one h II of th u Inr zontal thtust is resolved on the front wall,
wi hout a^v c t nic acting tnfí i'nce whatevei, except the wall
Itself the bond of which is unfortunately cut offby the outside
anta., at the veiy point upon which the tnmst of the arches is
concen ,ated
Again
" I  the pla i for the upper stone , I find that th« itemt
dnectly ovei the vestibule are increased by omitting two of the
cross walls that occur m the lower stoiy, so as to thiow the
whole width of the centre building into one room of fifty four
eet in each of those stot íes, the whole of which is to be groin
arched in their compartments, without any provision whatever
for lesistmg the lateia) pressure of the arches This plan of
arching can rnvei ho executecf with safely to the building
Ihe aiches in the lower stoi) would probably stand, provided
the entres wt-re kept under them until the walls receive the
superincumbent wei,h ol the structure but the fate of tho
upper arches, if executed upon the same plan, is cer am "
As a striking illustration of what is meant by
the houzontctl t/tuist of the ai ches agamsl the resisting
powei of the perpendicular tonife, I cannot forbear to
refer to a demonstration of the character of this
dsfect, in the descriptions given by Mr. Walter of
the plan of construction proposed to be adopted in
another public building (the new Patent Office)
now in progress, under the superintendence of the
sime official architect It may serve, also, toíesí
the greater confidence which is due to the " expe-
rience and practice of thirty jears" of the latter
gentleman over the immutable laws of matter, and
the well-settled principles of science, which he is
pleaded tocharacteuze as the " theory" of his pro-
fessional opponents. I read from the report of
Mr. Walter, on page 16 of the punted document
"the plan of the grind exhibition room which includes tho
Vvhtle of the up[ et soiy, (ol the Patent Olb e) b ing about

But I will not weaiy the patience of the com-
mittee by reading Jurther passages to show the
want   ot   soundness   and   substantia,   enduring
strength in the different parts of the structure    I
earnestly commend the whole of the able report of
this accomplished architect to the careful examina-
tion of every gentleman  before he Rives a vote
upon the subject    They will find there set down
many moic and not less decisive instantes of de-
fect than I have brought particularly to their no-
tice     In the description of the character and con-
struction of the work given by Mr. Walter, he is
full} snstaintd by the judgment and  opinion of
Capt   Parns    The  lauer  pronounces decidedly
" that the wills of this build ng are not sufficiently
strong to sisiam the later il pressure of the arches,
to be c ontmucd above the present height "    Other
architects,  of no  less  lepulation, have, with like
exphcitness, condemned the edifice.    I have been
informed that  such  was the result of the obser-
vations   of   the superintendent  ot   the  new  cus-
tom house m the city  of New York,  and  ot the
principal   constructor   of   the   State   House   at
Montpelier, in V, rmont, gentlemen distinguished
for professional  tM<mt,  good  taste, and the high
degree of public confidence which   they enjoy, and
Ytho^e attenLoti was casually drawn to the build-
ing while recently on a visit to thi"1 city    I might
al o  adduce  the more frequent and familiar re-
marks of respectable builders in and about the city,
m connection with the exti aordinary fact that, al-
though the i inn and cot siruction of the  building
have been ¡ a I    \e occasion of much severe criti-
cism  belo     me pUsl c, and of inquiry and close
ltnestgit       '     he coi i aittee, lor many months,
< nd ' us wc 11 is)   it 11 the ait'ulect, he n<>s not yet
attempted to just fy either his designs or his ¡ raetice,
b} a single appro ing voice from another    S r, it
might seem that all this should suíru e to satisfy the
minds of honorable members on this floor of the
insecurity and instability of the structure    The po-
sition which I occupy in the Committee on Public
Buildings,  devolved upon me the task of offering
this exposition of the sources of information, the
evidence, and th" results of personal obscn ¿tion,
which induced to  the leport, and, with no feeling
or motive beyond a sense of duty, I am less solici-
tous for the disposition which may now be made of
the subject, than that it should be fully and nght-
ful'y understood here and elsewhere
Mr Chairman, it is given oj the fel hertrte judg-
ment of one of the architects, "that tiie d< Iccts are
beyond the reach of any remedy, and that the
course dictated alike by prudence and economy,
is to take down the whole building." Concurring
in this opinion, the committee have accompanied
their report with a bill for this purpose. For my-
self, I see not how, on any plan which has been
suggested, aside from all exceptions to the supposed
weakness of the walls, the ends are to be closed, the
light admitted, the entrance and passage-ways made
convenient, and the building advantageously and
appropriately finished. By an official statement
from the Commissioner of the Public Build ng«, it
appsars that, discarding fractions, the sum of two
hundid thousand ¡lollms has already been expended,
and a further sum of three hundied thousand dollars
will be required for the completion of the building,
making an aggregate expense of hau \ million or
dollars. I have seen another estimate, comtitg
from the architect himself, which requires, for the ex-
ecution of his plan, and which I \ enly believe is
the only mode by which the building can now be
finished, vine hundred thodsam) doi Lars' The
calculations of others have carried it to a million
ai d a half'
Sir, I vouch not for the accuracy of any of these
estimates The latter may be, and probably is,
too large, but it is not to be supposed that the archi-
tect would swell the amount beyond the actual cost
And for what, I ask, is this heavy charge to be
incurred? For a building with which, when com-
pleted, the Government and the country never can
be satisfied—a building -which will not answer the
purposes intended by the law, badl} located, incon-
venient of approach, deficient in the lequired ac-
commodations, and unsafe in its construction.
Stop, then, the vtorlr at once. Do what the bill on
your table proposes Take down the imperfect
and half-finished walls, and, if you wouid have a
suitable edifice, employ a competent architect, se-
lect a propel site, adopt an appropriate plan of
adequate dimmsions, m the lansruatie of the law,
"for the present anl futuie accommodations of the
Treasury Department," and let the w ork be exe-
cuted in a style consistent with economy, and not
dishonoring the good taste and architectural skill
ol the nation.
I proceed now, very briefly, to show that the
mpasnre which the bill is intended to effect, in the
remov il of the walls of the bull ling, is recom-
mended by considerations of economy, and will be
attended with an actual saving of charge upon the
Treasury. A few simpl statements oí calcula-
tions and deductions will afford this demonstration
I have before me, Mr Chairman, a written com-
munication from Mr Mills, the architect, address-
ed to the Committee on the Public Bui'dtngs, from
which I read the following-
(Upon the questiou submitted to me what would be he esti

We thus have it from the architect himself, in
plain black and white, and m precise, certain,
arithmetical numbers, that the difference m amount
of sacrifice between taking down the walls of the
new building, or proceeding m their execution to
the consequent destruction of the building of the
State Department, will be bat about two thousand
dollars. I have before shown that the two build-
ings cannot stand together. And this is the inevi-
table alternative—either the old must be taken
| down, to giv* place to th« execution of the plan
