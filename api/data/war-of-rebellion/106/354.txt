great benfit to the general commanding the deprtment for the movements of troops, &amp;c., but it is suicidal to the pecuniary interest of this garrison.

I remain, very respectfully, you obedient servant,

JAMES H. WHITLOCK,

Captain, Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.

[Inclosure.] TUSCON, March 15, 1863.

Captain J. H. WHITLOCK, Commanding Officer, Tucson:

SIR: In obedience to orders received from you on the 18the of February to proceed immediately to the port of Libertad with all possible dispatch and ascertain if any vessel had arrived there with stores for the Government, and also to inquire the price and quantity of grain to be gad on the route, I respectfully submit the folowing: I left here on is no grain to be had unitil you arrive at the rancho of Buzani, distant from this point ninety miles. About 56,000 pounds of grain can be purchased in this place and Saric, which is five miles below on the river. Thirty-two thousand pounds of this is corn and the balance (24,000 pounds) is wheat. Colonel F. T. Lally has in Saric about 100 fanegas of wheat, included in the above. The prices range from $2,50 to $2,75 and $3 per fanega for the wheat, and $2 per fanega for the corn. At Tubutama, eighteen miles below on the same steam, there is about 90,000 pounds of wheat and 48,000 pounds of corn which can be bought at the sme prices as those stated above. It Atil [Datil], nine miles below Tubutama, there is 18,000 pounds of corn at $2 per fanega, and 180,000 pounds of wheat, the greater part of which they ask $3 per fanega, and the balance at $2.50 and $2.75 per fanega. In Oquitva, fifteen miles below, there is 75,000 pounds of wheat which can be bough for $2.50 per fanega, and 16,000 pounds of corn at $2 and $2.50 per fanega. In Pitiquito there is about 22,500 pounds of wheat and 18,000 pounds of corn. The former can be had at $2.50 per fanega and the latter at $2 the fanega. In Cahorca there is about 30,000 pounds of wheat at $2.50 and $2.70 per fanega and 16,000 pounds of corn at $2 per fanega. I estimate that there is about 425,000 pounds of wheat and 175,000 pounds of corn on the route from here to Libertad that can be pruchased at the above prices. To bring this grain out of the country there is an export duty of 50 cents per fanega, and it is absolutely impossible to purchase it except for gold or silver. I did not find any vessel in Libertad upon my arrival, nor has there been any one there, neither Mexicans nor Indians, since the departure of Major Fergusson in October last. I found the boat belonging to the Government exactly as it was left by Major Fergusson last October. I made the journey to Libertad and back in thirteen traveling days (distance traveled, 484 miles), but could have performed it in sholter time if I had been provided with good animals.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. R. BRADY.
