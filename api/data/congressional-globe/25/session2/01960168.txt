The same erroneous impression, too, had beeB
been made m reference to a late collector at New-
York. Upwards of §55,000 was charged against
him, whereas he did not owe a solitary dollar, so
far as Mr. C. kn«w, and this balance was still
standing, after twenty jears He had cited these
twe facts to gentlemen on all sides, that they would
not, in the pursuit of one object, inflict a stab
through the ribs of men as honest as ever lived,
and that the public might be aware of the nature oí
the document
Mr GARLAND knew not a single individual
when he moved his resolution, but there would
enough be shown to prove the system of individual
agency a bad one
Mr CAMBRELENG Not more so than under
the Bank of the United States, or the gentleman's
own system
Mr GRAVES had some objection, on the ground
of the expense, for the printing would probably co-
ver some five or six thousand pages
After some further rematks from Messrs REED,
McKENNAN, CAMRRELENG, SMITH, and
E  WHITTLESEY, the House, without taking
the question, passed to the orders of the day
EXPLORING EXPEDITION
A Message, in writing, was received from the
President of the United States, by the hands of his
private secretary, Abraham Van Bimi.v, esq com-
municating a report of the causes which ha\e de-
layed the sailing of the Exploring Expedition
Mr CUSHMAN moved to lay the Message and
documents on (he table, and that they be printed
Mr FILLMORE moved the printing of 10,000
extra copies, but it was objected to
Mr MALLORY moved their reference to a se-
lect committee
Mr HAYNES moved the Committee on Naval
Affairs
The motion to lay on the table prevailed
Mr WISE gave notice that, as soon as it Mas m
order to do so, he should move to take this subject
from the table, m order that it might be duly mus-
tigated
NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
In pursuance of the notice given on jesterda>
by   Mr    EVANS,  as    stated   in   the   proceid
mgs of that day, the House took up  the message
from the President of the United States on the sub-
ject of the Northeastern boundary, etc
Mr EVANS sud that befoie he proceeded he
should ask leave to introduce i bill—
The CHAIR said it was not now in order to do
this
Mr EVANS said he had slaied at an early part
of this session, that he would ask leave to bring in
a bill on this subject If it was not now in oider
to do so by the rule, he should ask the general con-
sent of the House to do so, and if leave was not
granted, he would then move to refer the subject to
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with instruc-
tion to report the bill he referred to He now asked
the general consent of the House to submit a mo-
tion for leave to introduce a bill
Objection being made,
Mr EVANS then tnovd to refer the messige of
the President to ihe Committee on Foreign Affair'.,
with instructions to report ihe following bill
A BILL to provide for surveying the northeast
ern boundary line of the Umled Stales, according
to the provisions of the treaty of peace of 1783
Be tí enacted by the Senate and House ofRcpi esenla-
hves oftlie United States of America in Congress as-
sembled, That the President of the United States
came the boundary line between the United Slates
and the aájacent Britosh provinces from the source
of the St Croix river, directly north to the high-
land  which divide the waters that fall into ¡he
Atlantic ocean, from those which fall irlo the
river St Lawrence, thence along said highlands
from the northwest angle of Noya Scotia to 'he
norlhwesternmost head of Connecticut river, as
particu'arly defined in the treaty of peace, con-
cluded at Pans, the third day of September,
seventeen hundred and eighty-three, to be accu-
rately surveyed and marked, and suitable monu
ments to be erected thereon, at such points as may
be deemed necessary and important
See   2  And. be it further enacted, That for th
purposes aforesaid, the President be, a * is hereby
authorized, if in his judgment it shail be necessary,
in, addition to the services of the corps of Topo-
graphical Engineers, to appoint, by and with the

and one surveyor, who shali perform sueo dufe
respectively as may be assigned to them by the
President, and who may employ such assistants un-
der the direction of the President, as shall be neces-
sary, and who shall make an exact return of their
proceedings to ihe Presiden!, together with a correct
map oí the country ovci w hieh satd Une passes,
(\hibiting the prominent points of us topography,
and the location of iho works and monuments by
them made and erected
Sec 3 .ánd 6« %tfurther tnaciei, That the com-
pensalion of said commissioner and surveyor shall
be respective!}  at the rate of--------dollars per
annum
Mr EVANS begged leave to assure the House
that it w as not his disposition to take up the time of
the House m a discussion oi this matter, if his duty
would permit him to do so He should, however,
ronsidet that he would be wanting m the duty he
ov, ed to the Slate of Maine, if he neglected to take
the first opportunity which presented itself of
bunging this important subject to ihe consideration
of the National Legislature He would now say
that he hid most sedulously sought an opportunity
of bunging this matlei to the consideiation of the
House He was the more anxious to bring
the matter to ihe consideiation of the House,
beeiuse the subject had never been discussed,
ind «is but little understood in this House,
or in ihe othei branch of the National Legislature,
ind because it was a question of the most deopand
abiding interest to the States of Mane and Missa-
chusetts Ii had been alluded to in the Message ol
the President of Ihe United States as an important
subject, and it was considered by lum in his Mes-
sage as a mattei of gicat surprise tint this Govern-
ment had been organized for hall a century, and
yet dots not know its mm limits Now, he wished
to bung to the notice el the House a proposition
for ihe purpose of aectlenling the movements
of the Genual Government towards a settle
ment iif the question The object of the bill
he had bioiip.ht to the notice of the House was to
take one step, on ihe part of our Government, to-
wards a final si alement ol lliis question to tin s i-
tisi k lion of all plrt es He desired the legislative
pouei ol iht cotmiij tocóme lo the aid of the
Executive in relation to this matter, and the object
he had in v pw by the bill was to brm¿ the two
Houses ol Congiess to sustain and aid the Execu-
tive in the settlement of this question He begged
leave here to siy that this measure was not a mea-
sure of his alone, but it was a measure of the peo-
ple and Sute of Maine It was not a measure
required bv htm alone, but it was required and
cal'ed for by the Legislature ol the State of Maine
It was called lor by resolutions of that Legis-
lature, now Ij ing upon tin tablt s of members, and
these resolutions nsk the General Government to
do the identical lhing proposed by the bill he bad
introduitd Ii hid ihn been lived upon ihe Ge-
ni nl Government by the Guvernor of the State of
Mum He must su), n rclalic n to tins matter,
that he had c uisi tu complain ol the neglect of the
General Governn cut towards the State of Maine
lie had to make complaint of the General Go-
vernment in not protecting the < m/ens oi the State
of Maine from wrongs committed against them by
a foreign Government
In making there complaints, be made them in the
name of the State of Maine, for he had been long
enough here to learn that when complaints of this
kind were made, they were generally set down to
some political hostility to the Admmistiation This
matter, however, wa not a political matter, as all
branches o( tl c Government of Ihe State ol Maine,
made these complaints A Democratic Governor,
a Dpmocrat c Legislature, and Democratic public
journals had made these complaints, and this
showed that it was no political question, as all par-
ties concurred in r<-l ition to the ma ler He trust-
ed, thf refore, that th sc complaints would not be
looked upon as bung caused by political feeling
Mr   £   then went  into a very lengthy detail
with respect to the northeastern boundary Ime,
and the twrespoadeace between the two- Govern-
veraments t  relation to the same, for the purpose
of showing that the boundary claimed by the Go-
vernment of the Untied States was the true
boundary.
Before Mr. E had concluded, he gave way to
Mr. Lincoin, for a motion to adjourn, who, how-
ever withdrew the motion at the request of
Mr GARLAND of Virginia, on whose motion
the bill from the Senate " to prevent the abatement
ot suits and actions now pending, in which ihe late
