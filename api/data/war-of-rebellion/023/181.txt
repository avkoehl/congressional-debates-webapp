BATTLE CREEK, July 18, 1862.

General D. C. BUELL:

A man I sent out has just returned (7 o'clock a. m.) from Dunlap and says cavalry in squads are continually crossing toward McMinnville, but no infantry. He met the brigade I sent out this morning nearly to Jasper and reported no enemy near.

T. L. CRITTENDEN.

TUSCUMBIA, July 18, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Have directed the clothing to be sent forward. The shoes, pants, and some shirts, drawers, and socks immediately; the balance as soon afterward a brigade to Decatur without delay. Order have already been given to cross at Eastport. I will cross the train and be in readiness to cross the troops here as soon as the troops to relieve me arrive.

If I don't remain as at present posted until the arrival of General Grant's troops the enemy will be sure to do some injury to the railroad, as their cavalry are above and below this place.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

LOUISVILLE, July 18, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Mr. Sinley, a responsible man, and uncle of Captain Starling, of Major-General Crittenden's staff, arrived here to-day from Henderson, saying that a band of guerrillas has taken possession of that place. There is more danger in Kentucky than is realized.

J. T. BOYLE.
