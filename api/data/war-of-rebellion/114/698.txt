I do not ask to be released but only that General Kelley's permit and my parole of honor may be respected and that I may be permitted to return to Pennsylvania. Aftelection has passed I will return to General Kelley and he can then dispose of me as he may then think proper or you may order, but at present you would do me a great personal favor by permitting me to return at once to Pennsylvania and Ohio where my pecuniary interests imperatively call me. No one has made any charge against me save that I am called a secessionist. I defy the world or any one in it to say that I ever uttered a secession sentiment in my life. I offered the resolutions in the State senate saying that we would not involve Maryland in secession and in advocating those resolutions I said on the floor of the senate that any Marylander who was in favor of Maryland's seceding was not fit to be outside of a lunatic anylum. I say so yet and say also secession cannot get one vote in the Maryland senate as it is now constituted or I have been utterly deceived by the members. May I ask an order from you to cast me out of this place upon the cold charities of the world?

With high regard, I am, your obedient servant,

THOMAS J. McKAIG.
