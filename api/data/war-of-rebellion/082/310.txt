HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 17, 1864.

Colonel BELL:

The lieutenant-general telegraphs that he anticipates an attack on some part of our lines to-night or to-morrow morning. You will, therefore, have your command on the alert and in readiness. Direct your brigade officer of the day to visit his picket-line several times during the night and see that every man on picket is watchful. Enforce the rule to have one-half of the men on the front line awake; at 3.30 all will be aroused. Your reserves now in the creek bottom will be under arms at the same time.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JNumbers W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to Colonel Curtis and Lieutenant-Colonel Coan.)
