HEADQUARTERS STEAMER LAURA,Off Dauphin Island, August 5, 1864.

Major C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that the troops under my command disembarked near the western extremity of Dauphin Island on the evening of the 3rd instant and immediately moved up and invested Fort Gaines. About midnight of the 4th I succeeded in getting the light artillery in position within 1,200 yards of Fort Gaines, which opened on the fort this morning simultaneously with the passage of the batteries by the fleet taking their water batteries in reserve and silencing them. It affords me much pleasure to announce that the fleet passed the batteries this morning with the loss of a single monitor, the Tecumseh, sunk by a torpedo; and that Admiral Farragut is now operating in the inner harbor of Mobile. The rebel ram Tennessee surrendered after a stubborn resistance. I am now disembarking the heavy guns on the south side of the island near Pelican Island Spit, and will have them in position to open on Fort Gaines by daylight to-morrow.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GORDON GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - Mr. Buchanan, formerly of the U. S. Navy, commanding rebel ram Tennessee had his leg shot off and is now a prisoner in our hands.

HEADQUARTERS STEAMER LAURA,Off Dauphin Island, August 5, 1864.

Major C. T. CHRISTENSEN,.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: As the fleet under Admiral Farragut has succeeded in passing the batteries and is now in the inner harbor of Mobile, it is probable that the two forts at the entrance will hold out until reduced by a regular siege. This is particularly probable in the case of Fort Morgan, which has still he advantage of land communication with Mobile. Under these circumstances I respectfully suggest that an additional force of at least 3,000 men be forwarded to me, without delay, in order that I may complete the investment of Fort Morgan and compel its early surrender.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GORDON GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

DAUPHIN ISLAND,

August 5, 1864.

[General E. R. S. CANBY;]

MY DEAR GENERAL: Yesterday was a glorious day for our cause. The admiral, with his usual good luck and pluck, succeeded beyond all expectations, and in spite of all Fort Morgan and the rebel fleet could do.

The firing was perhaps the heaviest and fiercest of anything on record. The game little monitor which led the fleet went down almost like a flash just inside the light-house, supposed to have run onto a torpedo or other obstruction.
