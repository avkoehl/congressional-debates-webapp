The demonstration on the Blackwater is to continue for one week from the 11th, unless Captain Flusser hears from General Foster to the contrary, and even then the strong show of force is to continue for a few days longer, and even until General Foster sends to inform him that the main attack is completed. The force then it to make some hostile demonstration on the 11th, to keep it up until the 19th, and then to maintain a hostile attitude until he hears from General Foster.
