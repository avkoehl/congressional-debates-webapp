a The buns are numbered in each battery from the east.

b This work, although the gun platforms are in serviceable condition, requires renovation and repair. The parapets and slopes are worn and next to useless for protection. It is fairly supplied with ammunition, and is garrisoned by 20 men nightly from the Twentieth South Carolina Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant Copeland. It has no magazine.

c The parapets and slopes of this work are in fair order. A magazine has been commenced and could be speedily competed if sods were attainable. The left gun wants a traverse rails. The guns are fairly supplied. The work is garrisoned by a detachment, under Captain Bomar, quartered in proximity.

d Parapets and slopes of this battery want renovating. They are almost useless for defense. No magazine. Guns fairly supplied. Garrisoned by detachment from Captain Bomar's company, Lieutenant McDaniel commanding, and quartered in proximity.

e Parapets sound, somewhat encumbered with sand. Magazine good. Guns well supplied. Garrisoned by 15 men of First Carolina [Regular] Infantry, under Lieutenant Singleton, First South Carolina [Regular] Infantry, quartered at hand.

It would be well if all these batteries, as soon as possible, and the defective ones had been strengthened and repaired, were provided with double or triple chevaux-de-frise and the gorges covered with strong palisade work, too prevent their being carried by a surprise of a coup de main when the island is not fully manned. The matter will be treated of in accompanying communications.

a The guns are numbered from the north of east face around the work.

b From the northern extremity of the work south to the magazine the parapet and traverses want repair sadly. Sodding is much displaced, and a portion of the sand has worn away. The magazine is generally in a fair condition, but the western portion wants resodding.

c The traverses in the redoubt are generally in good order. The bomb-proof wants sodding and repair. It has been constructed some time, and will bear attention and work.
