able-bodied men and will be stripped of a great many of its arms, is terrible. Women and children, and even men, are in terror. It is heart-rending, and I cannot make myself responsible for it. I will gladly go anywhere with my own brigade that you see fit to order me. I beg you therefore to keep the negro brigade directly under your own command or place some one over both mine and it. I have given instructions to collect as much transportation as possible, so that I can cross Berwick Bay with my brigade, and will go down to-morrow in person to hurry up things. I cannot move my brigade there yet, as there is not sufficient drinking water, and this is a better camp.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Vols., Comdg. Reserve Brigade.

HEADQUARTERS RESERVE BRIGADE,In Camp, near Thibodeaux, La., November 5, 1862.

MAJOR: In still further confirmation of what I wrote to you in my dispatches of this morning relative to servile insurrection, I have the honor to inform you that on the plantation of Mr. David Pugh, a short distance above here, the negroes who had returned under the terms fixed upon by Major-General Butler, without provocation or cause of any kind, refused this morning to work, and assaulted the overseer and Mr. Pugh, injuring them severely; also a gentleman who came to the assistance of Mrs. Pugh. Upon the plantation also of Mr. W. J. Miner, on the Terre Bonne road, about 16 miles from here, an outbreak has already occurred, and the entire community thereabout are in hourly expectation and terror of a general rising.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Vols., Comdg. Reserve Brigade.
