The remittances to Nashville on account of rail-
roads in thesouthwestin 1865, are as follows namely :
Estimate.
In March, on the November, 1864 $1,805,500 00
In March, on the December, 1864r  1,000,000 00
On May 2, on the January, 1865  1,-100,000 00
On May 2, on the February, 1865   1,400,000 00
On May 30, on the April, 1865  1,400,000 00
$7,005,550 00
The estimate for March was held back by General
McCalluin, it being supposed that the sums required
on the previous estimates and'on that of April would
be suflioient to pay off all his indebtedness to the 30th
of Juno, owing to expected reductions in the estab-
lishment.
General MoOallum reports, on the 3d instant, that
SI,000,000 willbesuiiicieiit, on the estimate for March,
to enable-Captain Crilly to pay off his indebtedness.
It will be perceived from the foregoing statement
that these railroads have been, costing, during the
present year, upwatds-of $1,300,000 monthly, and the
expenditures- are still gains oa.
These expenditures were necessary during the war,
but it appears to me that the Government should be
relieved from this heavy expenditure by the restora-
tion of the railroads to the companies, and I recom-
mend that this be done as soon as it is possible to
make arrangements for the transfer on the basis of
nay report of 19 th of May last.
The appropriation for transportation of the Army is
exhausted, and there is no money in the Treasury for
Army appropriations against which requisitions can
be drawn.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. 0. MEIGS.
Brevet Major General U. S. A., Quartermaster General.
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War,
Washington, District of Columbia.
Which last letter was indorsed as follows:
The recommendation of the Quartermaster Gen-
eral is approved, aud he is directed to turn over the
roads immediately.
By order of the Secretary of War:
THOMAS T. ECKERT,
Actina'Assistant Secretary of War.
ah Department, July 21, 1865.
The following order, as appears on page 459
of Report No. 34, was then issued, to wit;
Quartermaster Gsnekal's Office,
Washington, July 27,1865.
Respectfully referred to Brigadier General D. C.
McCallum, general manager military railroads, to-
gethefwith a copy of the report of tho Quarter-
master General of May 19,1865.
General McCallum will at once transfer all therail-
roadsin the military division of tho Mississippi which
are controlled at Nashville, in accordance with tho
recommendation of the Quartermaster General, as
approved and directed by the Secretary of War.
General McCalluin will please report what rail-
roads will remain in the possession of the military
authorities when this transfer shall have been accom-
plished.
By order of Quartermaster General:
ALEXANDER BLISS,
Brevet Colonel United States Army.
These orders were next followed by execu-
tive orders of August 8 and October 14, 18C5,
as heretofore copied into this report.
It will be perceived that the recommendation
of the Quartermaster General to sell the prop-
erty of the United States at public auction was
not adhered to in tho executive order, but the
companies were permitted to purchase at a
fair valuation, which is believed by the com-
mittee to have been the better plan, provided
the policy of returning the roads to the com-
panies were the correct one.
The essential and very important difference
between the recommendations of the Quarter-
master General, approved by the Secretary of
War, and the executive order of August 8, is
that, while the Quartermaster General recom-
mended, as per paragraph four of his letter,
" no payment or credit to be given to the rail-
road for its occupation or use by the United
States during the continuance of the military
necessity-which compelled the United States
to take possession of it by capture from the
public enemy," the President required, as
per paragraph fifth of 8th of August order,
" tabular statements to be made of all expend-
itures by the Government for repairing each
road, with a full statement of receipts from
private freights, passage, and other sources;
also, a full statement of all transportation per-
formed on Government account, giving the
number of persons transported and amount of
freight, ana the distance carried in each case."
While in the former, the Quartermaster
General's recommendation, no payment was to
be made to the captured roads for their use, in
the latter, the President's order, it is apparent
that it must have been contemplated lhat. a't
some future period, a general settlement would
be made with the roads, and that the evidence
should be preserved of their use, with Teceipts
from all sources and charge? for all'trans-
portation credited to the roads and all expend-
itures "for repairing" charged.
This belief is strengthened by the fact, as
disclosed in the testimony, that when exten-
sions of payments on bonds maturing were
sought by various roads, and the President saw
proper to order payments to be unconditionally
suspended, claims wore then distinctly made
against the Government for thej use of the
roads. Michael Burns, president of two of
those roads, as hereinbefore stated, testifies on
page 278 of Report No. 34 that he "got
possession of those two roads in 1865, by an
order from the War Department, at Washing-
ton, through General Thomas."
A second question brought the reply that it
was " the order of August 8, 18G5."
On page 280, Report No. 34, to the question-,
" Have you paid up your indebtedness to the
United States, from time to time, according
to the terms of your bond?" he replied:
" I bare carried tho mails, troops, supplies, &c.,
faithfully, in accordance with my agreement, and
any other work I was called on by the Government
to do."
A second question on this point seemed to
be necessary — the answer related to the
Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. To the
question, " Did you pay any of your indebted-
ness in money?" he replied—but before
giving that reply it may be well to state that
the value of property sold to this road and
amount secured by its bond, in 1865, was
§1,500,551 73; and that its indebtedness on
31st January, 1867, was $1,532,740 00; and on
the 1st day of November, 18(57, $1,556,893 57—
he replied (page 280, Report No. 34) on 25th
day of February, 1867:
" I paid, I think, $67,000; I was led by the order of
August 8 to believe I would get a just settlement.
The Government is indebted to tho company
§3,766,1)15 61, as shown by tho Quartermaster Gen-
eral's account."
To the question, "What is your claim for?",
he replied, " For the use of the road during
its occupancy by the United States."
Mr. Burns also testifies, on page 283 of
Report 34:
"That the Government is indebted to tho Nash-
ville and Northwestern road §818,160 over and abovo
the work done in completing the road," "for prop-
erty used, property taken, and property destroyed."
He likewise testifies, on page 290, Report
No. 34:
" I came myself to Washington to see about this
debt, and to get tho time extended for payments;
and the company have employed agents from timo to
time for that and other purposes."
With what success Mr. Burns met may be
seen in order on page 221, Report No. 34, of
which the following is a copy:
Quartermaster General's.Office,
Washington, I). O., May 5,1866.
Captain : An order of the President of the United
States, dated April 25,1866, and referred to this office
by the Secretary of War April 30,1866, directs that,
collection be suspended until further orders of the
indebtedness of the Nashville and Chattanooga Rail-
road Company to the United States. You will be
governed accordingly. By order of the Quartermas-
ter General.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
ALEXANDER BLISS,
Brev. Col. and A. Q. M:, in ckarge-of Fourth Division.
Captaik S.,R. Hamill.
Assistant Quartermaster, Nashville, Tennessee.
All railroads were restored to the original
companies, under executive orders of August
and October, 18G5, or under orders substan-
tially the same as hereinbefore shown.
Orders issued by commandinggeneralsprior
to executive order of 8th of August, 1865,
under which some roads were restored, were
subsequently modified to conform to its re-
quirements.
For instance, it appears on pages 237 and
238 of Report No. 84, that General Canby,
then in command of the military division of
the west Mississippi, by orders ratified by Gen-
eral Grant as early as June, 1865, relinquished
some roads to the companies, upon conditions
different and more favorable to the Govern-
ment, and more in accordance, as the com-
mittee believe, not only with rights growing
out of the laws of war, but with principles of
justice and considerations of the future safety
of the country.
General Canby testifies t
"They were turned over to the companies provis-
ionally, subject to the condition that thfc right of
confiscation was reserved, and that all th© property
to which tho Government had title by capture or
otherwise should be paid for by the companies.
The evidence shows that General Canby's
orders were afterwards modified, by orders
through the Quarterm-aster General, to conform
tb' that of August 8.
value o® bestobbd pbopekty.
It is interesting and not unimportant to know-
the value of the property restored, that the
loyal people may know whether to say of those
who have been intrusted with their interests
"Well done, good and faithful servants," or
no.
On page 325 of ReportNo. 34 Colonel Alex-
ander Bliss's report shows that one hundred
and twelve engines and five hundred and
ninety-one cars captured by the United States
were returned to former owners. The com-
mittee, therefore, present a statement of the'
value of such property as appears from the
report of the military railroad department to
have been returned, to wit:
2,538 miles of railroad, worth $30,000 per
mile $76,110,000
112 engines at $15,000 each  1,680,000
091 cars (91 at $2,000 ; 500 at $400)  382,000
A total of. $78,202,000
In addition to this a very large amount of
property once possessed was suffered to fall
back irito the hands of the original owners of
which the committee can find no account in
detail, such as shops and contents at Knox-
ville, Nashville, aud Chattanooga, Tennessee,
and Savannah, Georgia. The very extensive
workshops at Savannah alone were worth mil-
lions of dollars.
But it is sufficient to add to the amount just
named  $78,202,000
the amount expended in labor and ma-
terials on said roads to suppress the
rebellion, aided by their officers, direct-
ors, and stockholders  45,367,180
to make 8123,569,480
which could have been rightfully demanded or
obtained under the laws of war by right of cap-
ture, but which was freely restored.
to pay for cse of.
But large as the amount is for an apparent
reward to those who had struck down three
hundred thousand defenders of the Govern-
ment, Jand incredible as it is that high Govei u-
ment officials, who were in such positio® as to
be compelled to witness the heavy drafts for
men and money upon the Government, should
approve and advise such reward to treason,
it was left for President Johnson to take the
initiative, in his order of August 8, for paying
for the use of such property. Forty-five mil-
lion three hundred and sixty-seven thousand
four hundred and eighty dollars and twenty-
seven cents were expended in "labor and ma-
terials" on said roads. Four million seventy-
nine thousand five hundred and eleven dollars
and thirty-three cents were expended upon the
Nashville and Chattanooga road. That road
claims §3,766.915 64 for the use of the road
by the Federal Government. The other roads
claiming in the same proportion would, bring
the Government, after the $123,569,480 sur-
i rendered and relinquished, in debt to this
| portion of her conquered enemies for use of
' this property alone, $41,889,265; that being
