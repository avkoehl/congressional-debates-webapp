HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, September 20, 1863-8 o'clock [a.m.]

[General GORDON GRANGER]:

Your note of this morning just received. I am moving my forces near the road leading from McDonald's to Reed's Bridge, ready for any attack that the enemy may make on myself or on General Steedman's front, who I understand is posted near the Little Chickamauga, on the Red House road. Are we in supporting distance of each other? If not, you had better report to General Rosecrans at once.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,September 20, 1863-10.35 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs me to say, if possible refuse your left, sending in your reserves to the northward, as he would prefer having Crittenden and McCook on your right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK S. BOND,

Major, and Aide-de-Camp.

[Indorsement.]

Dispatch received. The enemy are pushing me so hard that I cannot make any changes. The troops are posted behind temporary breastworks.

GEO. H. THOMAS.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Battle-field, September 20, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

The enemy penetrated a short time since to the road leading to McDaniel's [McDonald's] house, and I fear they are trying to cut off our communication with Rossville through the hills behind the center of our army. I think, therefore, it is of the utmost importance that Negley's division be ordered to that point-the left of my line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Widow Glenn's, September 20, 1863.

General GRANGER,

Rossville:

Is Missionary Ridge available, supposing we should fall back?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
