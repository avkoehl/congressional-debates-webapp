along from Dam Numbers 4 to Downsville, and Ewell from there along to the heights toward Saint James' College. This man is not certain that the whole of Longstreet's force is there. He thinks he has about 7, 000 men.

I am now going to see General Buford, and find what information he has.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS, July 12, 1863-10. 10 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: General Hays called on me for re-enforcements. I gave him 2, 500 men to strengthen his line, and have a brigade of 3, 000 in reserve. Two divisions are massed a mile in rear. The line taken by the Second Corps is at the base of a sloping ridge, and untenable. The ridge this side is strong, and can be held. It would involve the throwing back of the left of Sykes.

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

NEAR SAINT JAMES' COLLEGE, July 12, 1863.

General PLEASONTON:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my skirmishers are within very short range of the college, on the right of the road. I find them in large force on my right, and a strong line of skirmishers in front. I have driven them from their first position on the left of the road. They have a long line of rifle-pits just back of the college, covering the ground in that vicinity. I cannot advance farther till the infantry are ready to support me, my line in front has to be so much extended.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

PENNOCK HUEY,

Commanding Second Brigade, Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, July 12, 1863.

Colonel McMAHON,Of General Sedgwick's Staff:

I am directed by the major-general commanding to inform you that the right of his line will not rest at the point lately indicated to you by him, but will be farther to the left, and nearer to Jones' Cross-Roads.

GEO. SYKES.
