THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C. MVES, WASHINGTON, D. 0.
Thirty-Seventh Congress, 3d Session.
THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 1863.
New Series No. 36.
the consul at Guayamas shall heieafter receive a
salary of $1,500 a year.
Mr. CHANDLER. I propose in some future
bill to place the consul at Guayamas m schedule
B of the consular act, as suggested in the letter of
the Secretary of State.
Mr. FESSENDEN. This is the proper bill for
it, if it is done at all. I move to lay the bill aside
informally and take up the pension appropriation
bill, in order that the Senator may have time to
reduce his amendment to proper form.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no ob-
jection, that course will be pursued.
PENSION APPROPRIATION BILL.
The bill (H. R. No. 616) making appropria-
tions for the payment of invalid and other pen-
sions of the United States for the year ending the
30th of June, 1864, was considered as in Com-
mittee of the Whole.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I propose two verbal
amendments which I think ought to be made, not
from the committee, but on my own account.
Before the word "invalid," in the seventh line,
I move to insert the word " Army," so as to make
the clause read—"for Army invalid pensions un-
der various acts, $3,000,000."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. In the ninth line, after
the word " to," I move to insert " revolutionary
soldiers and," so as to lead, " for pensions to rev-
olutionary soldieis and widows of those who
served in the revolutionary war," &c.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate asamended,
and the amendments were concurred in and or-
dered to b<2 engiossed, and the bill to be read a
third time. The bill was read the third time and
passed.

Mr. FESSENDEN. I will now move an amend-
ment, instead of striking out the words " for the
regular Army," in line one hundred and forty-
three, to insert those words in each of the succeed-
ing paragraphs down to line one hundred and sev-
enty-four.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no objection
be interposed, those modifications will be made.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Line one hundred and
seventy-four makes an appropriation for " med-
icines, instruments, dressings, &c., for the volun-
teers." 1 move to insert the words, "for the vol-
unteers," in the appropriate place in each of the
succeeding paragraphs until you come to line two
hundred and five on the 9th page.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those modi-
fications will be made by the Clerk, and the Sen-
ator from Maine will see to it that they are accu-
rately made according to his suggestion.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Theie is one other amend-
ment which escaped me. There was a mistake
in punting, or else in not rightly reading the
manuscript in line one hundred and ninety-six on
the ninth page. It now reads, "for icc, fruits,
and other comforts, under acts of August3,1861,
and July 5, 1862, $120,000." It should read,
"$170,000."
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Maine moves to amend that paragraph by
strikingout " twenty" and inserting " seventy."
The amendment was agreed to.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amend-
ments reported by the Committee on Finance
having been acted on, the bill is now open to fur-
ther amendment.
Mr. RICE. I offer an amendment to insertat
the end of the bill the following:
For malum,' .vmii v«y of the Miinio-otaatul Red River? of
tho Noiiii with a view to improve the navigation of each,
ami to nomieci the same b\ a canal, $'.">,000, to be expended

also the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. FESSENDEN. What is the amount?
Mr. RICE. Five thousand dollars.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I should like to hear the
reason for it.
Mr. RICE. 1 will ask the Secretary to read the
