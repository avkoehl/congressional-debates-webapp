SEPTEMBER 13, 1861.-Action at Booneville, Mo.

Reports of Colonel Jefferson C. Davis, Twenty-second Indiana Infantry.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 13, 1861.

Express from Colonel Eads, commanding at Syracuse, says that about 3,000 from Price's column are advancing to Booneville, and later information indicates that as the most threatened point. Large re-enforcements for future operations from this point can no longer be delayed. A force of sufficient strength to give the enemy a successful battle in his rear would settle al trouble about here.

JEFF. C. DAVIS.

Major-General FREMONT.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 13, 1861.

Dispatch from Booneville since 6 o'clock this morning. The Home Guards were still defending their entrenchments. Enemy 600 or 800 strong. I shall re-enforce Booneville to-morrow, but think it probable that that point is Price's aim; all day goes to confirm it.

JEFF. C. DAVIS.

General JOHN C. FREMONT.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 14, 1861.

Rumor states that the troops at Booneville have surrendered. The War Eagle is off for there. I shall have 1,200 men ready to march from Syracuse to-night. The heavy rains of the last 36 hours have caused some delay. Push forward re-enforcements.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Colonel, Commanding.

General JOHN C. FREMONT.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 14, 1861.

Major Epstein has held his position at Booneville. The rebels had given up the fight and were waiting for Green. All right to-night, if my troops get in his rear. The detachment I ordered back a few days ago
