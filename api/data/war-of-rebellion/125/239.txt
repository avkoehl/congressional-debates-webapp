CULPEPER, VA., April 21, 1864.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

As a rule I would oppose receiving men for a short term, but if 100,000 men can be raised in the time proposed by the Governors of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa they might come at such a crisis as to be of vast importance. I would not recommend accepting the in lieu of quotas now due on any previous calls for three-years" troops. Otherwise I would.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I inclose an approximate estimate in reply to your questions of this morning, as accurate as can be prepared without taking much more time, We have at the principal constructing arsenals and depots regulations clothing with which 200,000 men could be fitted out at once. Of irregular clothing there are on hand: Coats, 20,000; trousers, 50,000; greatcoats, 120,000. The supply is therefore small at present.

The actual cost of clothing 100,000 first outfits, regulation clothing, I estimate at this time at $4,400,000. If greatcoats are not issued - and they are not necessary for a summer campaign - the cost would be $3,400,000. Camp and garrison equipage, tents, &amp;c., for 100,000 men would cost $800,000. Total thus far, $4,200,000.

To supply 100,000 men with complete wagon trains for active operations on the scale existing in our armies would cost $3,000,000.

The above estimate has been hurriedly made. If action is to be taken upon this I should desire to be allowed time to cause a more careful estimate to be made, with time to examine recent contracts for supplies.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
