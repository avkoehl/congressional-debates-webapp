a point the House ought not to be ealied on to
decide.
Mr. STEVENSON. We have agreed as I
have stated.
The SPEAKER. If the majority report
is to be withheld for that purpose, it might
as well have been held by the committee.
Mr. STEVENSON. It was agreed that the

clerk to committees, etc.
Mr. CAKE. I rise to a privileged question
and submit the following resolution from the
Committee on Accounts:
llesolved. That the Committee on Patents and the
Committee on Private Land Ciaims be authorized
jointly to employ a clerk at a salary of 84 80 per
day; and the Sergeant-at-Arms bo authorized to
employ a paying teller at a"salary of $150 per month
daring the present Congress.
Mr. WOOD. Is that open for discussion?
The SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. SCHENCK. Is that a report from the
Committee on Accounts?
Mr. CAKE. It is.
Mr. DAWES. Ought not this clerk for the
Sergeant-at-Arms to be during the session of
Congress rather than during the Congress?
Mr. CAKE. The report was agreed to in
my absence. I will modify the resolution so
as to say during the session.
Mr. WOOD. lam opposed to tie-resolution,
and demand the regular oruer of business.
Mr. CAKE. The Sergeant-at-Arms keeps
an open bank account with every member of
Congress.
Mr. WOOD. The Sergeant-at-Arms has pay
enough and perquisites enough already.
Mr. CAKE. I demand the previous question.
Mr. WOOD. I demand the regular order.
The SPEAKER. It is too late.
Mr. WOOD. I demanded it before the gen-
tleman demanded the previous question.
The SPEAKER. Did the gentleman rise
in his place and do it?
Mr. WOOD. I did.
The SPEAKER. If the gentleman states
that he rose before the report was made  
Mr. WOOD. Not before the report was made,
but before the previous question was demanded.
The SPEAKER. That was too late, as the
report was before the House and could have
been discussed for five or sis hours.
The question recurred on seconding the
demand for the previous question.
The House divided; and there were—ayes
46, noes 50 ; no quorum voting.
The SPEAKER, under the rule, ordered tell-
ers; and appointed Mr. Wood and Mr. Cake.
The House again divided; and the tellers
reported—ayes 03, noes 48.
So the previous question was seconded.
Mr. SCHENCK. Is the resolution divisible?
The SPEAKER. It will be after the main
question has been ordered.
The main question was ordered.
Mr. SCHENCK. 1 demand a division o-f the
resolution.
The Clerk again read the resolution.
The SPEAKE R. Does the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Sciiestk] demand a division of the

The House divided; and there were—ayes

So the first part of the resolution was agreed to.
Mr. WOOD. I understand that the gentle-
man who offered the resolution has consented
to make it apply merely to the present session.
Mr. CAKE. I agree to that.
The SPEAKER. That amendment will be
made. The Clerk will report the latter part
of the resolution.
The Clerk read as follows:

So the latter part of the resolution Was
agreed to.
Mr. CAKE moved to reconsider the votes by
which the resolution was agreed to J and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I
demand t-he regular order.
DEFICIENCY BILL.
The SPEAKER. The regular order being
called, the House will resume consideration
of the bill (H. R. No. 1340) making appropri-
ations to supply deficiencies in the appropria-
tions for the service of the Government for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1870, and for other
purposes, on which the House yesterday had
seconded the demand for the previous ques-
tion and ordered the main question.
Mr. DAWES. I do not desire to claim for
myself the privilege to \uJiich I am entitled of
an hour after the seconding of the previous
question. Bat I desire to give a portion of
that time to my colleague on the committee
from Michigan, [Mr. Beajian.J
Mr. BEAMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to Call
the attention of the House and the country to
some remarks made on Friday last, in Com-
mittee of the Whole, on this bill by my col-
league, the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr.
Beck,] in which he took occasion to diseuss
the expenditures of the present Administration
and to compare them with those of Mr. John-
son's administration. I regard those remarks
as somewhat sensational, and as calculated to
produce a false impression. The gentleman
from Kentucky said:
"If Ok: House is under the impression that the
expenditures of the current year have been dimin-
ished below what they were during the previous}'ear,
in my opinion ita very mistaken impression."
Again he says—
"Shattho expenditures of (he Government this
cuircnt year are nearer §100,(100,000 than any other
figures that the gentleman e,:n estimate, certainly
nearer than they are to §314,000,000/'
How the gentleman could arrive at such a
conclusion is beyond my comprehension. Cer-
tainly it could not bo reached by any fair con-
struction of the documents and figures he pro-
duces. He refers to Executive Document No.
155, and relying upon the "recapitulation"
therein contained he says that it '' shows that
for the War, Navy, Interior, Diplomatic, Treas-
ury, and other Departments therein set forth,
the balance on hand on the 80th day of June,
1809, was S1Q2.-390.159 07/' There'fere appro-
priated, he says, for the expenses of these De-
j partmeuts for the fiscal year ending June 80,
I 1870. $111,733,000, " making a total of over
| one"—I think he means two—"hundred and
| fourteen million dollars, of which he [the Secfe-
i tary of the Treasury] says there will be expended
| daring the current fiscal year 8200,101,4-32 20.
| He reports Hie estimated amount which may
j be applied to the service of the fiscal yearcom-
i mencing July 1, 1870, and ending June 30,
I 1371. as 87,307,000. The balance to be ear-
| ried to the surplus fund is §634,000. If, there-
i fere, you add £654,00& to the. $7,307,000,
j making $8,225,832. and deduct that sum from
the S102 390, l->9 07 of unexpended balances,
; j.' u ii.i ve 894,.107. ">20 44, which the Secretary
] certifies as necessary to be used (Itiling the
: current il:-c;;: year in addition to all ths* appro-
priations made by Congress, and if you add it
to the whole appropriation already made and
now asked for this year you run it up1 to very
near four hundred million dollars. ' It is
difficult to see how these figures will justify the
amount estimated in the recapitulation for
expenditures is only $206,101,483 20. The
gentleman from Kentucky makes some vague
statements in regard to the expenditures of the
Navy and other Departments, but gives ns no
figures by which we are to determine the facts
upon which he makes the assertion of an ex-
penditure of $400,000,000. I propose there-
fore, if possible, to ascertain what have been
the expenditures for the years ending on the
30th of June, 1868, and on the 30th of June,
1869, respectively, and as near as may be what
will be the expenditures for the current fiscal
year. By reference to the finance report for
the year 1868, page 49, we find that exclusive
of interest and principal of the public debt,
and premiums paid on Treasury notes, the
expenditures amounted to $229,916,088 11.
The expenditures for the year ending the
30th of June 1869, exclusive of interest and
principal and premiums of the public debt,
were $190,496,354 95. In proof of this state-
ment I refer to the finance report for the year
1869, page 35.
The amount expended for the first half of,
the present fiscal year, that is for the six
months ending December 31, 1869, exclusive
of interest and principal of the public debt and
the purchase of bonds, has been $87,218,909 14.
I refer to " receipts and expenditures by war-
rants for quarter ending September 80,1869,"
and to later statement for quarter ending De-
cember 81, 1869. The expenditures for the
remainder of the year will be still less; but
assuming them to be the same, the entire
expenditures of the year will amount to only
$174,433,938 28. Prom this amount should
be deducted the amount of repayments, exclus-
ive of repayments on account of interest by
disbursing officers for the first quarter, being
$2,461,851 31, and for the second quarter
$1,688,928 39, in the aggregate§4,150,779 73;
and estimating the repayments for the re-
mainder of the year at the same amount, we
shall have the sum of $8,301,559 46 to be
deducted from the $174,483,938 28, which will
reduce the actual expenditures for the present
fiscal year to the sum of §160,132,378 <32.
From this statement we see that the expend-
itures of the present year are less than those
of 1868 by $63,782,709 29, and that they
were less than those of the year 1869 by
$24,363,976 13.
Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman has
entirely mistaken the character of Executive
Document No. 155. The Secretary of the
Treasury does not say in that document that
"all the balance will be expended during the
current, year." He does say that he transmits
the "amounts estimated as necessary to com-
plete the service of the current fiscal year."
Estimates and actual disbursements are very
different things; otherwise we should have Imd
no balances on the 1st July, 1869, nor the still
larger balances on the 1st July, 1808. The
statement of the Secretary, fairly construed,
simply means that these balances should not
be carried to the surplus fund. In this case
he has merely followed the practice of the De-
partment. 1 do not defend the praetiee, but
Departments and bureaus have ever been dis-
posed to hold on to unexpended balance?, to
be used in case of exigencies, and have ever
been unwilling to have them transferred to the
surplus fund. I repeat, the Secretary nowhere
stated {hat those balances will ali be used, am.
I assert that the facts and figures show that
they will not ail be expended during the pres-
ent fiscal year:
