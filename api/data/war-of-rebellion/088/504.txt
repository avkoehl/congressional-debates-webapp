HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864-12.20 p. m.

Major DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have not received the special order, but understand that the colored troops at signal tower have been ordered to Deep Bottom. I understood that a demoralized brigade with General Ord, under General Paine, was to go to Deep Bottom, and that I was to take the signal tower troops with me.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864.

Brigadier-General Birney:

The following dispatch was received from department headquarters:

By a mistake the special order referred to was not sent you. It is as follows: "Brigadier-General Ames, with his division, will relieve the colored troops now at the signal station. These troops, on being relieved, will relive all the colored troops now with General Ord. The colored troops now with General Ord will relieved General Foster's command."

Respectfully,

R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General BUTLER:

I had expected to take the colored regiments near signal tower with me to Petersburg, and that [the] colored brigade with General Ord would go to Deep Bottom. I expect to need them there if General Ord's report of Terry's division is correct.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
