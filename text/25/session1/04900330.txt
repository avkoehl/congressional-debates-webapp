Postponement of fourth instalment.—Mr- Sibley*
II. of Reps.
this G^vennneit Jim th > t> my m ml, constitutes astiong
argument ag unsUhis bill I ne whole amount may be made
available to the ¡states No átate m the Union could refuse to
take the notes of its awn banks in payment of its distributive
shaie of the fouith instalment lor myseli, I would scorn to
ask any O'her paymastei tnan the banks of my own State
When the banks oí a State held mote upon deposite than tiie
distributive shaie of that Statis those banks could, pay that
excess to other ¡S* Ue&, whose banks did not hold upon deposite
ah amount equal to the du>u ibutive shaios oí those bta'es In
this way, the operation might be made Javoiablc to the banks,

mentof the fouuh instalment, under the deposite act of IM^i
Has om pa^t action 1 dsed ni^t and ica^onable expectations on
the jjart of the btates that this money would he paid, and have
those expectation^ led 10 important priangements by the States,
deeply and seuoitslyafferting the interests of the feople^ If '
Wi Lhta have obugviou   and duties, been impo cd upon us I
which could not be disregarded without violating the faith of
the Federal Government, and fixing a stain upon the national
honor That our position jn this inattei might be cleaily seen,
it would onlylae necessary tolecui to the law of Congress foi
regulating the depositéis of the public money, passed on the 23d
of June, 1836, and to the action oi the several States conse
quent upon that law By the I3th section of that statute, Con
gcess declared thatall the money which should be m the Tiea
sury efthe United states on the 1st of January, 1837, (icserving
the aum of #5,000,000,) should be deposited with such of the
States (mproportion to their repiesentaíión) as would agree to
receive the same, and pledge its faith for the safe keeping and
repayment of the money, in ms.ahuents not exceeding thirty
thousand dollar^ pei month, upon thirty days' previous notice
The sum being 111 the Treasuiy on that diy was. directed and
requuedby the law to be so depo&Hed, in (om eqiMl m-stal
ments, on the rust days of J^nuaiy, A pul. July, and Octobc ,
1837
Under this law it bectmc the duty ot the Secretary to a, cei
tarn the amount of money in the Tieibuiy on the 1st day ol
July, 1837, and to communicate that amount, to^ethei with the
law winch app -vi lated and hied the destination of the m niey,
to the seveia'otates, m, an entire proposition lor their iccvpt

appears by a communication made by him w Cong! ess In Jauu

foim Congie^s of the meabiues adopted by this Depdttment
sinco the 1st instant, in conq liance with the 13th section of the
act 1 egulatmg the deposites of the public money "
"The balanCv. m the TieaoUiy on that day, which was subject
tobe apportioned among tho several ¡states, has, on the pimci
