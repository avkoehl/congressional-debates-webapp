be allowed and encouraged to traffic, though it
bring the highest luxury; for then it is but the en-
joyment of the product of labor. But man cannot
produce land, nor can he increase its quantity any
more than he can produce or increase the quantity
of air or water; yet he is permitted to speculate
and traffic in land, and incidentally, as I have
shown, to traffic and speculate in the very ele-
ments of fire, air, and water.
The" doctrines I hold on this subject are (hose
which «were held by Aristotle, Montesquieu,
Blackstone, Jefferson, Jackson, and Channing.
While Rome, Athens, and Sparta were in their
glory, these views and sentiments were held by
all their leading statesmen. Nor did those coun-
tries fall until these doctrines had been abandoned,
or the systems embraced by them been overthrown.
But a misfortune is, that, in entertaining these
' doctrines and views in modern times, too many
run into the ridiculous and odious doctrines of
socialism and the community system, and come
to contend that all things should be held in com-
mon, as if the ccupancy of land, as a natural right
for the procurement of the means of life, would
destroy in man all evil passions or proneness to
vice. The socialism of Proudhon is an abandon-
ment of all ideas of and dependence upon Christi-
anity, and a presumptuous arrogation of self-suf-
iiciency to man, that, unaided by divine influence,
he can, of himself, put off his grosser nature, and
stand forth in spotless purity. When the suffer-
ing and death of the Saviour shall have redeemed
man from the thraldom of sin and the effects of
the fail, and not till then, may this be expected.
Let us now leave general consideiation^, and
view the measure before us in its bearing upon
the Government and the States which contain no
public land. As regards the Government, it can
only be considered in its effects upon the revenue.
I have long believed that the Government should
cease to consider and treat the public lands as a
source^f revenue; and I ask no better or higher
justification for this belief than the authority of
President Jackson. In his message of December
14, 1832, he says : " It seems to me to be our
' true policy that the public hinds shall cease, as
4 soon as practicable, to be a source of revenue, and
* that they be sold to settlers, in limited parcels, at a
f price barely sufficient to reimburse the United States
' the expense of the present system," &c. Again:
'"To put an end-forever5 to all partial and inter-
6 ested legislation on this subject, and to afford to
4 every American citizen of enterprise the opportunity
' of securing an independent freehold, it seems to me
1 best to abandon the ideaof raising a future revenue
1 out of the public landsThe same idea H repeat-
ed in his veto message of December 4, 1833, and,
as far as I know or "believe, he held these views
till he died.
Until direct taxation shall be resorted to, the
great and important source of revenue to the Gov-
ernment must be duties on foreign imports. Now,
every one knows that the'amount thus received is
enhanced as the number of consumers of foreign
imports is increased. Hence I contend that the
revenue would be vastly increased by the policy
proposed; for, by increasing the number of agri-
cultural producers, you increase the number of
import consumers, and their ability to consume;
or, in other words, their ability to purchase for
consumption. The Government, I have no doubt,
would be the gainer in her revenues after sacrifi-
cing her receipts from the public lands.
If this argument be correct, to the extent of the
augmentation of the revenue, the measure before
us would be beneficial to the non-landholding
States; and to a further extent, for we propose to
relieve them and the Government from the bur-
dens of the present land system. But, above and
beyond all this, the old States, equally with the
new, are interested in the adoption of the proposed
system. We have no population but what was
once <heirs; ours are now landholders. When the
old States join in ccdmg the public lands to the
use of thersettler, they join us in ceding them to
their own citizens as well as ours; and they
thereby increase incalculably the number and
ability of the consumers of northern fabrics of
all kinds, and of the southern products of sugar,
cotton, rice, and tobacco, as well as the amount to
be transported over their canals and railroads, and
in their shipping. will venture the prediction
that, in five years after the system shall be estab-
lished, one year will yield to the old States more
Corsica.

value in this way than five would by way of profit
on the sales of the public lands. Why, sir, ther
whole revenue last year from lands was but
$1,688,959-; the net proceeds would not exceed!
$1,300,000. The benefits which the individual
States would derive from this would not equal the
benefits to be derived from the simple addition-
of fifty thousand to the able consumers and ship-
pers of the new States. As a matter of pecuniary
interest, therefore, the old States should be in favor
of this system. Whether we view the measure*
then, in its bearings upon the interests of the Gov-
ernment or of the old States, rt is one of correct
policy and sound expediency.
To present another view of this subject, I wilF
read some extracts from an article in the " Work-
ing Farmer" for October, 1849.
"Of the population of 17,431.85*2, we find employed as
follows: Agricultural pursuits, 1 to every 4}j persons mams-
facturingtrades,! lo every 32 persons; navigation, 1 to every
305 persons ; learned pro'p<«ion«, including engineers, 1 to
every 289 persons; commerce, 1 to every 146 persons.
" Thus it will be seen that, notwithstanding those engaged
in agriculture form by for the most important cIh-s, still no6
an acre of the puhhc domain lias® ever been appropriated for
thPir especial benefit. Every application for an appropriation
of land for experimental tarms, agricultural colleges, &c.?
ha& been promptly denied; while the applicants, atu-r being
told that agriculture toas a noble art, und that the fanners
were the bone and sineiv of tke country, have returned home,
minus their expenses to Washington, with nothing to the
credit of the account bnr ahsf ot empty compliments fron>
legislators', and a request to vote for their continuance ii*
office as a fair return tor these compliments.77
I propose now to examine the different proposi-
tions which have been submitted to the Senate by
the Senators from Illinois, Massachusetts, and
Texas.
That of the Senator from Illinois has the virtue*
at least, of being a bill proposing t;o do something,
and not a mere abstract resolution, asserting a
truism, or proposing an inquiry into a truism.
But I deem it an imperfect bill. It proposes,
it is true, to grant land to the actual settlers; but
an actual settler may be a man of wealth, and at-
ready a landholder. The bill, then, fails in this
particular to secure the grant to the landless and
homeless, as it should do. Again, it does not
guard the land when granted from being monopo-
lized by the land speculator, or from again accu-
mulating in the hands of the few, to the privation
of the great mass. Further, the bill of the hono-
rable Senator does not provide for the protection of
the land to be granted from forcecf sale on execu-
tion. Without this the grant would be of little avail
to the poor, already burdened perhaps by the in-
cumbrance of debt and liability, imposed upoti
them by the crafty, through the medium of their
necessities or misfortunes. While it grants the
land, the bill does not propose to relieve the Gov-
ernment of the present system for the disposal of
the lands. This can only be done by the plan pro-
posed by the bill under consideration—by letting
the States intervene between the Government and
the settler. The bill of the Senator from Illinois
is, then, nothing morf than a measure to give away
the public lands—unguarded for any of the great
and far-reaching purposes for which I have been
contending, and for which alone should such a
measure be entertained at all. I am satisfied that
the distinguished Senator from Illinois—who, I
believe, through the whole course of his life, has
had his intentions politically right—must now see
that he has fallen short in his bill of making those
piovisions which would secure the great end and
object to be held in view—the security and protection)
of the public domain as a home and abiding-place for
the otherwise homeless.
While the proposition of the Senator from Tex-
as is obnoxious to all the objections I have been
noticing, it does not possess .even the virtue of
being a bill for any purpose, but a mere resolution
of inquiry. And the proposition of the late Sen-
ator from Massachusetts [Mr. Webster] is not
only a mere resolution, but is a resolution in-
volving a mere abstraction or truism. It is as fol-
lows:
"Resolved, That provision ought to be made by law
that every male citizen of the United Siates, and every male
person who ha« declared hid intention ot becoming a citizen
according to the provisions (>f law, of twenty-one years of
nge or upward*, shad br> entitled to enter upon and take anv
one-quarter section of th« public lands which may be open
to.enter at private *ale, i'oi the purposes of residence and
cultivation; and th.it when such citizen shall have re.-ided
on the same land for thrpp yoar*, and cultivated the same,
or if, iHuunn the mean time, resiuence and cultivation shall
be held and earned on by his widow or his heirs, or devisees
for the space ot full three years from and after making entry
