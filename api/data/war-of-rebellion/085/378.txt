HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, [September 26, 1864].

Major-General CURTIS:

I have been to see General Rosecrans. We think as things now stand, the Second Colorado, would do more good where it is than elsewhere, until the raid develops more fully. Let it remain until you hear from me again, and if be not absolutely necessary I will advise you promptly. Answer.

B. GRATZ BROWN.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Fort Leavenworth, September 26, 1864.

B. GRATZ BROWN,

Saint Louis:

What did they turn over our troops for it they can't spare them? I am ordered to press forces down below where troops are needed most because actual trouble has begun. Where is Price? I desire to use my force where I think it most needed, not where you and others do. I have for several days retained the Second to accommodate General Rosecrans, and because no other troops come to Kansas City, but General Rosecrans has five times the force in Missouri I have in Kansas, and I cannot agree to arrangements that place me in charge of troops I cannot use.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington City:

The raid of Price is developing a pretty large force, and it is clearly the policy of the Government to order and publish a postponement of the draft in Missouri until after the raid is dealt with. When Price is whipped we can get more volunteers than we want, and until he is disposed of the draft will only furnish a means of excitement to the enemy.

Yours, respectfully,

B. GRATZ BROWN.

MOUND CITY, September 26, 1864.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

I sent another gun-boat up to Cache Girardeau for temporary service in that vicinity last night. Devoe can remain a week, as you requested. The admiral has not returned.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Captain, &amp;c.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General PLEASONTON,

Philadelphia:

Where is General A. Pleasonton? He is much wanted here immediately. Please get him word.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
