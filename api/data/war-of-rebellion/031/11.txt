except one feed of hay for horses, over the most rugged and mountainous part of Western Virginia. Remained in Summerville until 29th. Left for Camp Piatt, and arrived in camp on the 30th at noon. My men suffered severely from frost. I left 2 men in the hospital at Summerville, whose boots we cut from their feet. Others were more or less frozen. My horses were very much cut down.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

J. C. PAXTON,

Colonel, Commanding Second West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry.
