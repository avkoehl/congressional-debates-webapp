Marcy supposed would accrue to us m making
the treaty was the free navigation of the St, Law-
rence, and yet the Canadian government discrim-
inate against us in the tolls on their canals, while
their people have used our canals and railroads
without any discrimination against them. In
consideration of tli^s concession of the so-called
ficc navigation of the St. Lawrence, we gave them
the free navigation of Lake Michigan, which is
far more valuable to them than the privilege gran ted
to us as its equivalent. The free navigation of the
St. Lawrence lias been to us of very little value.

Mr. SPAULDtNG. 1 ask the consent of the
committee to extend my remarks for a minute or
or two.
.Mr. STEVENS. I must object.
Mr. SPAULDING. Then 1 must avail my-
self of the opportunity of finishing my remarks
upon another amendment.
The amendment was agreed to—ayes forty-five,
noes not counted.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I desire to pro-
pose the following as an independent paragraph:
On all diamonds, emeiaids, and all other jevvchy, a tax
of three per cent, ad valorem.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next paragraph of the bill was read, as fol-
lows:
On flour, manufactured from wheat, ten cents pci barrel

Thus it will be seen that by this unwise tieatv \v> re-
leased to Canada an arnmal duty on impoits of .$1,293,403,
in 1854, which by tin* oidmaiy increase would now be at
lea^t .$2,000,000 annually in 1862. Tins would be a very
handsome Mim to add to our revenue** at this time, and
which the people of Canada could well afford to pay for hav-
ing the advantages of our markets.
tion for less or gieater quantities put up for sale in sacks or
other packages: ProvUeri, That flour made or manufac-
tured at any mill lor eu^tomcis, for their own consump-
tion, and not foi sale, shall bo exempt fiom duty.
Mr. STEVENS. I move to strike out that
paragraph. The Committee of Ways and Means
agreed at first upon this tax, and it was reported
in the bill, but they immediately afterwards came
to the conclusion, after examination, that their
first action was erroneous, and they agreed t-o
strike out the paragraph. Their reasons for com-
ing to the position which they now assume are
these. In the fiist place, a tax upon this article
would be a tax upon an article of food used by all
classes of the people, Hour entering largely into
the consumption of the very poorest classes.
In the next place, a tax upon flour would be
adding so much to the burdens of the manufac-
turers of the country. England took off all duty
upon breadstuff's as a protective measure, and not
as a matter ot free trade, as has been erroneously
asserted. It was a measure designed for the pro-
tection of her manufacturers, in older that they
might have chcap food.
But the most powerful reason which induccd
the Committee of Ways and Means to recom-
mend the striking out of this tax was that flour
is one of the articles included in the reciprocity
treaty. If we put a tax upon flour the result will
be that Canada will send m her flour free of duty
and free of taxation. Theie is no method of
reaching the taxation of articles included in that
treaty, and hence such a tax would be discrimin-
ating against our farmers and our inilleis.
Mr. MALLORY. I wish to ask the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania whether there is no way
by which we can impose a tax upon the articles
included in that reciprocity treaty? Can we not
reach the object by imposing the tax when the
goods have come to the hands of the purchasers?
Mr. STEVENS. I am sure that my ftiend
from Kentucky is a good enough lawyer to know
that m no indirect way can we honorably avoid
the stipulations which sve have solemnly entered
into in our treaty with Great Biitain.
Mr. MALLORY. So far as I am conccrncd,
the question of honor does not come under con-
sideration when we arp dealing with a so noto-
riously dishonorable Government in its dealings
as the Government of Great Britain. The only
question with me is whether we can reach this
object without a technical violation of our treaty
obligations.
MESSAGE FItOM THE SENATE.
The committee informally rose; and the Speaker
having resumed the chair, a message was received
from the Senate by Mr. Forney, its Secretary,
announcing that the Senate had passed bills of the
following titles; in which he was instructed to ask
the concurrence of the House:
A bill (No. $341) to change the location of the
port of entry for the Puget Sound collection dis-
trict; and
A bill (No. 243) changing the name of the
American-built schooner Curtis Mann to that of
Supply.
The message also announced that the Senate,
in the absence of the Vice Piesident, had chosen
Hon. Solomon- Foot President of the Senate pro
tempore.
The message also announced that the Senate
have passed, the first without and the latter with
amendments, (in which he was directed to ask the
concunence of the House,) a joint resolution and
bill of the House of the following titles:
Joint resolution (No. 49) for the appointment
of Theodore D. Woolsey, of Connecticut, a re-
gent of the Smithsonian Institution, in place of
Cornelius C. Fclton, deceased; and
A bill (No. 242) making appropriations for the
naval sei vice for the year ending 30th of June,
1863, and additional appropriations for the year
ending 30th of June, 1862.
The committee lesumed its session, and pro-
ceeded again to the consideration of the
TAX BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I am willing to do anything
which is honorable and just to relieve our people
from the injustice of that treaty. But, sir, the ;
reciprocity treaty expressly enumerates flour and !
gictin, and says that no duty shall be laid upon I
either. Now, suppose you could lay a duty upon i
flour which is made in this country: do you not i
discriminate against our own millers and in favor
of the Canadian millers, and will not the result be
that our farmers along the border will carry their
gram over into Canada to be ground? It will,
it seems to me, be doing great injustice to our
millers.
There is, however, another reason. If this duty
is to be laid upon flour, as this matter affects our
western friends particularly, I think the tax ought
also to be imposed upon grain.
1 wish to say further, that I have seen it' stated
by these numerous letter writers,who are so truth-
ful and so intelligent, that the Committee of Ways
and Means had comc to the conclusion to strike
out this paragraph m consequence of the pressure
brought to bear upon them by a delegation of
Rochester millers. All 1 have to say in reference
to that statement is that the committee never heard
of any delegation from the Rochester millers, nor
that any such delegation was here or in existence
until they learned it through the newspapers.
They would have been, and will always be, ready
to listen to the suggestions of gentlemen coming
from any quarter whatever. But the impression
seems to have gone forth that this Rochester del-
egation has been so potent and so powerful in its
influence upon us, when, in truth, it never came
before us at all, nor have we ever heard of it, other
than through the medium of the newspapers.
Mr. McKNIGHT. In rising to oppose the
amendment of the committee, I do not wish to be
understood as desiring to oppose the interests of
New York and of the great West. I think I can
readily see what operated on the mindsof the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to induce them to strike
off the taxon flour, as the sanje reason, doubtless,
operated to lead them to strike out that on coal
and pig iron. But I am a little surprised that the
gentleman from Chemung, [Mr. Diven,] and other
gentlemen from the flour regions, do not rise to op-
pose striking out this tax, as they did that on coal,
both being alike embraced in the Canadian reci-
procity treaty, and alike affecting our own pro-
ducts. Is it the difference as to whose ox is gored ?
Why should the flourescape a tax rather than the
coal which bakes it? But as I concur with the
Committee of Ways and Means now, and usually,
and think flour ought not to be taxed, 1 shall vote
for striking out the paragraph.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I move to amend the par-
agraph proposed to be stricken out, by adding a
proviso, that the tax shall not go into effect until
the expiration of the treaty between this country
and Great Britain, known as the reciprocityjreaty.
You have provided a tax upon some of the agri-
cultural products of the country, and I cannot
think the reasons assigned by the Committee of
Ways and Means are sufficient to justify the strik-
ing out this tax altogether. It may be unjust to
collcct the tax while the reciprocity treaty remains
in foice, but it may be collected properly after the
expiration of that treaty.
The argumcntpresented by the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means to-day in support
of this amendment applies with increased force
to the amendment which I proposed the other day
to strike off the tax upon salt, which was opposed
by him or by his committee. It is true, sir, that
the article of flour goes largely into the consump-
tion of the people of the country generally, and
that it enters to some extent into the manufactures
of the country. But, sir, while that is true in
reference to flour, it is true also that salt enters into
the consumption of everybody, whether manu-
facturers or not, whether rich or poor; yet you
have voted to lay a tax upon that article, of vital
interest to society, something like four per cent.
But when you come to tax flour, which is used
not only in this country very extensively, but
which is an article of large exportation, the gen-
tleman tells us that we must not impose a tax
upon an aiticle of so universal consumption, and
which affects particularly the manufacturers.
Now, sir, 1 admit that if you could raise the
money required by the Government without
touching the agricultural products or raw material
produced m any State, you ought to do so; butl
think, in any event, you should not levy a tax
upon that without which a man cannot live. A
man can live without flour, but he cannot live
without salt It is just as much a proper subject
of taxation as any other article of production in
the United States. That is the reason I move to
postpone the duty to the expiration of that treaty.
