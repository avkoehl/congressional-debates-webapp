Major ADRIAN TERRY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report for the information of the major-general commanding, that in obedience to Special Orders, No. 10, April 28, 1865, I marched from my camp near Raleigh, at 7 a. m. April 29, and reached the Neuse River at Smithfield at 8. 30 a. m. the following day, and commenced fording the river at that point; owing to the steep banks of the river and the poor condition of the animals of the train, the crossing occupioed until 4 o'clock of the afternoon of the 30th. I reached Goldsborough at 3 o'clock this p. m., and have relieved the troops of General Birge's division stationed here and in this vicinity. I relieved detachments of General Birge's division at the railroad bridge over the Neuse at Smithfield Station and at Boon Hill, on the march down. Hinton's Bridge, above Smithfield, was reported carried away, and the pontoon bridge at Smitfield had been taken up on my arrival.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. PAINE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
