Captain ODLIN:

Send ammunition for the guns in the fort, if possible, and also an artillerist. Do not think we can mount the gun you spoke of in your dispatch, but will try. Two men came in from Blandville to-day; report about 3,000 to be there to-night. Headquarters of Forrest are in Mayfield.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, KY.,

Captain MUNROE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General says the order is imperative; the gun must be mounted. If you have not enough force you will impress the citizens. I have just loaded ammunition for Cairo, Mound City, and Paducah. We have no shells. The enemy are advancing on the Milburn road. Cannot return to-night. The telegraph office must be kept open all night.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
