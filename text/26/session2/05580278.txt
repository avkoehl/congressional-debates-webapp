changed for specie, they were taken a1  the banks,
which gave their own notes in exchang , even afier
they had stopped specie payments    It was one of
those humbugs which characterized the late Admi-
nistration.     But the necessity  for disguise   has
ceased, and it is admitted that they are  loans, bat
not quite a debt.   The mask is partially lemoved,
half concealing and half disclosing the  feaiures
behind it.    They are a temporary loan'     Mr. Van
Buren, by way of casting  the shadow before the
coming event, ha  bestowed upon us a very im-
pressive parental admonition against trie creat'on of
a permanent national debt.   And who < ver thought
of doing this?   Great Britain may be said to have
a permanent national  debt, and the baying has
been attributed to Alexander Harm! on, " hat  a
national debt is a  national blessing "   If he dm
use such an expression,  it was condemned as soon
as uttered, and has nevei been received into the
creed of any party in this country      It was never
supposed by us for a moment that any  ot our
loans were permanent     The debt of the  Revolu-
tion, and that of the late war, awakentd the  deep-
est solicitude for their speedy extinguishment What,
then, is a temporary loan?   A loan for one vcai is
as much a loan as one for five years, and both are
temporary.
On the passage of the bill there will be iue mil-
lions of Treasury notes our, as soon .is the notes
now called for shall be issued And this has been
renewed from year to year, and u is tailed a tern
porary loan, to distinguish it from a loan lor a
longer time than a year. The debt is renewed like
a note in bank, which may be lenewnl tor oeven
years, and still be called a note of ninety days
Let things, then, be called by their light name ,
call a spade a spade, and the issue ot Treasury
notes the creation of a debt If the nation is in
debt, let the nation know that n is in debt. Let it
be known Ihat we are obliged to borrow, ,mcl if it
be necessary to authorize the Secretary (Í the Trea-
sury to negotiate a loan, let hun be nllm  ed tohavc
recourse to the issue of Treasury notes in the last
resorl. -There could be no difficulty, I repeal, in
effecting a loan at a lower rate of inteiest ilian six
per cent, the amount payabh on the Treasury
notes. The credit of the nation is still good as to
its ability to pay, and its character lor m'cgniy
will, of course, rise under the new Administration
From every indication which I we, the public con-
fidence in it will not be surpassed by ihat reposed
in any Administration since the days of Wash-
ington.
It has been shown by those gentlemen who hive
so ably analyzed the Secretary's report, that the
sum of five millions, in addition to the current re-
venue, will not be sufficient for the present year
They have shown a iaige amcunt of deb -shich
must be provided for now, or at no remote period
hereafter. It must have struck every one as very
strange that there bhould be a diflerence between
the gentlemen to whom I have just alluded, m their
respective understandings ot the report, to so large
an amount as six millions No one will question
the acuteness of their perception. The Secretary
must be either remarkable for hi* talent for mysti-
fication, or very unfortunate in ihe manner of ex-
pressing his ideas But no one can speak with
certainty of the amount of outstanding claims
which will be presented at the Treasury during the
present year. I approve the amendment offered
by the gentleman from Maryland, [Mr Jemfer,]
authorizing the loan of ten millions of dollars, it
required, for the use of the Government The
first quarter of the next year should be provided
for, not to speak of the prudent precaution heiett -
fore pursued, but of late years discontinued, of
always having at least five millions in the Treasu-
ry to meet unexpected contingencies—that is, of
always having enough and little more The Se-
cretary estimates the probable receipts from the cus-
toms at sixteen millions of dollars, and tne gentle-
man from New York [Mr Vandeupofl] declares
that it will exceed that amount, that he is assuied,
by private letters from the city of New York, that
there will be very large importations But this,
after all is but conjecture- for many circumstances
may occur to check importations. The further re
ducuon of the amount of duties on some article
towards th1 end ot thejear, together with specie-
payments may 1"« en the rece p The severe
lessons 'augh' by exct-ssive imporiat ons wi 1 have

will be cramped by thai effort to íesume and
maintain specie paymen s, an ' it v ill not be in
their power to extend their discoun The busi
nesi. of the coming year may be ds uud and safe
busmen, but necessarily limited St is not in a
year, you may rust a sured, su, tha ims country
can regam the full tide of its piospei ty It is very
possible that the recipis irom cu toms ma, fall
con iderably below loose of the last j ear
I wil ask, Mr. Cnanman, whether it i fa r for
the outgoing Adminisiiatiou to 'cave lueu succes
sors without «mple funds t) canyinih Govern-
ment, and 10 meet all Hie appropriations of Cou-
gre;. ? Tne power is still in their h aids, and sure
ly the intimauois coining from ¡hoNe who will
share the confidence of the new Admimstrat oia
ought to have some weight
The supporteis ot the Admin .(ration have
ehaiged upon Us the dtsire to call a special se sion
of Congress, and the charge is hi own back, on ac
caunt o the appan nt unwillingness to p ovide suf-
ficient means ler th<" new Admin stration I do
not suppose it is the nish of any one to call an ex
tra session, but it may be the desire of each party
to shift from itself the tesponsibility ol sufh a mea-
sure, should it become mdispen^ab e I nope it
will not b> net is iiy, it will lieexp^nsue and in-
convenient, and nothing but the mi t nr tit neces-
sity will just ly it But it is n t ihe pío met. oi
this House to ckt"iiriiiit upon that iic-ce sat T t
Constit'itioa has assuned this duty t > the dtscituoii
of Ihe Executive, and we hav^. no r gal to f jr sta1
or dictate to that otanih oí th> O /ornm nt m its
aopropnate action Uui 1 th Presuifnt shall e< tor

partments shall have cximmed into then situation,
n is ímuossililc for him 10 knew wha net' si>y
dure nmy be 1 i such a measure fTnlorcsrpn
events may haj pen to lemltr it wist and prudent
The ¡ ubh< voice may demand  t ¡n crdir to draw
the exact line of distinction between th  last aim
the piescnt Administiations At all everts, die ne-
cessity and propriety lies with tne Executive, and
not with thib body.
And why should not General Hairison have ihe
same privilege as Mr Van Buren1 Soon aftei
that gentleman came into office, he was induced,
reluctantly, to eail an extra session Ht was not
blamed for this, but it was supposed that something
would be done fo' the country The nation was
disappointed, isslead of proposing any measure to re-
lieve the d stresses of the People, t ie President made
the novel and ominous declaration, which has stuck
to him luce the garment ot Nessus, that the people
are in the habit of expecting too much irom the
Government, that it is en< ugli for the Government
to take caie of itstlf, an 1 the people must take care
of themselves' This Congiess extraoidinary did
nothing but pass a5Treasnry note bill, ?lfhough the
follower in the footsteps had received a letter from
General Jackson, atter the explosion of the pet
hank bubble, telling him, above all things, to be
ware of Treasury notes Thus the mountain was
in labor and brought forth a mouse The peop e
expected too much fiom the Government' When
the Executive called itself the Government, and
controlled the action of th  Legishtare, it was na-
tural for the people to look up to it for more than it
could perform The Executive could lead trie peo-
ple into diilicidty, but coulu Lot lead them out
again It was a diflcieii matter with Congress,
wmch wis the peoph íepiesented by iheir immedi-
ate agents The lawmaking branch tf the Go-
vernment, through which they express th^ir will,
is, or ought to be, m the hands oí ioe peiplt, and
fo tell them that thev expect too much of the Go-
vernment, is to tell tiem that they expect too much
from themselves The Executive ha] assumed pow-
ers which did not bs'ong to i, it had attempted to
interfere where it had no right to interfere, and
mischief and misfortune had followed, and then it
suddenly discovered that the poweis which it had
usurped are to be found nowhere It was most
unfortunate that this discovery had not been made
before the commencement of those experiments,
which have ihrown our country into aluust írre-
'rr-vabiedisorder Happily, tiny liaie putañead
to ihat centralizing, despotic, unit power grasped
by General Jackson, but which his successor could
not retain
And if Mr   Van Buren was jus ified in calling
au extra sess on, how much more will be Gei eral
Harrison?    The disasters which rendered it neces-
sary foi Mr Van Buren to resort to thi   measure,
were b ought about by the conduct of the preceding
Administration, ot which he wasparhceps, while, if
Genera1 Hanison bs compelled  to  resort to this
measure, it will be m consequence of the  misfor-
tunes brought oo   the country by his predecessor,
whose measuies n? had condemned     What were
the causes, prox mare and remote, which led to the
cull of an extra session by Mi  Van Buren?   It was
the stoppage of specie pa ments by all the banks in
the Union, the failure ef ihe pet bank system, the
danger of losing the public money placed in their
keeping by General Jackson on his own responsi-
bility, contrary to the  will of Congr ss, and in vi-
olation of the Constitution    It this was aftsrwards
involuntarily sanctioned by Congress, it was but an
aggravation of the offence    The consequences of
these arbitrary acts had been foretold again and
a^am, but the warning vas despised     The public
documents, th  message of the President, the re-
ports of the Secretary  of the Treasury, who had
become his ofKc r, and no longer the officer of Con-
gress, as m the olden time, continued to deceive the.
people to the last moment, by false representations
of the op ra ion of the pet bank system    At the
veiy moment ol his leurmg from office, the Gene-
ral,  in  lmitauoD of Wa mng on,  sent forth his
farewell iddress, in which he  procia'taed, like  a
sentinel on the waicn towtr, "all's well," when,in
truth, all was not well     Instead i f furnishing a bet-
let currency than  the Bank of the United ¡States,
i istead of preventing the expansions and contrac
ti m" of the currency, it did nothing  but expand
The number of banks increased from thiee hundred
to six hundred, and their issues  were enlarged in
proportion     There was nothing but expansion and
expansion, Ui til the  bubble  became so  thin that
mea of common sagact'y must have seen that  it
would burst     Speculations in the public lands, as
well as every kind of speculation, and the importa-
tion of foreign goods, were stimulated to phrenzy.
Surely this was the work of the party which placed
Mr Van Buren in power!    By the means of that
party di cipline  which had  been established, the
executive and legislative power had become almost
consolidated m the hands i f Mr Van Buren, and if
the party is not responsible, or at least its leaders, I
know not who is responsible     They had the mak-
ing of the  laws, and the execution of them, and if
Government be potent for good, it is also potent
for evil     If General Harrison shall be compelled
to call a special session, the necessity for it must be
traced to the present Administration, as the imme-
diate a  well as the remote cause of the difficulties
in which our country has been unhappily involved.
I hope the measure may not be deemed necessary,
and something may be done by  placing ample
mears in the hands of the new Administration
This debite has taken a wile range, far beyond
the limits ot the topics immediately connected with
the bill. Gentlemen have taken the occasion to
expre s their opinions upon a variety of subjects,
probably from a belief fhat no other opportunity
may offer, and because they may as well be ex-
pressed on this occasion as on any other, as they
are intended for effect elsewhere rather (han here.
To =ome extent I mean to use the same privilege.
The gentleman from Viigtma, [Mr Wise,] whom
I perceive now about to occupy his place, has «aid
some things m which I heartily concur, and oihers
¡n which 1 differ from him But every difference
of opinion, with respect to measures and policy, ¡"
not a d fference of principie I take pleasure m
expressing my acknowledgments for the undaunted
and courageous stand he has taken against this Ad-
ministration, and for his untiring efferts to lay opsn
its abuses Those who are faithless to the country
in proportion to their fidelity to party have no diffi-
culty in following a, common leader, because they
are not actuated by principle, but by the interests
of party.   On the contrary, those who seek the
