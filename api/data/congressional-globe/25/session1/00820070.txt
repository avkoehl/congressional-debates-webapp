Th' gentleman fiom Kentucky (Mr Chambers)
hav s"id this mor) ngon the piesentalion of sume
p"etiuons that a <!. r1- cloud w<<s hanging over the
admuiistiation, andnenov barelv wished to tell*hat
gentleman, ht apprehended that the friends of a na-
tional birik haci a dark cloud hanging ovei them
Mr CHAMBrRS said he had referred to the
dark cloud hang) g over the prospects of the ad-
ministration m the West
Mr. CAMBRELENG íemarked that he had re-
ferred to the dark cloud which was hanging ovei
the friend  of a national bank, here and throighout
the country He did not, lion ever, with to de-
bate fhe question, and simplv called for the yeas
and nays, which were ordered
Mr EVER.ETT siid the gentleman from New
York, (Mr Cambreleng,) had introduced this sub-
ject, and called upon the House to give a silent
vote upon it, and send it out to the peo[ le of the
country, as the expression oí opinion of the House
of Representative of the Un ted Sta'es His sen-
timents on this subject veie kiown to the House,
it was known that he was in fai or of a national
bank, and whenever the. pioper time arrived, he
should give his views on the subject fully He
would not, however, now go into this subject The
Executive had interposed his veto in advance up-
on a national bank, and there would be no op-
portunity of bunging this question forward at pie-
sent He hoped no friend of a United States Bank
wmld ihm\ of bringing forward a pioposition
fji the establishment of a natienal bank, until
he was certain of there being two-thirds in its
favor 111 Congress If the President of the United
States liad left the matter, as he ought to have left
it, io the representatives of the people, and said that
he would caí ry out the measures agieed upon by
Congress, there might have been some expectation
of carrying through some permanent measures of
relief to the country. But the President bad brought
forwatd «orne little petty measures foi the relief of
the Government, and said, when jou adopt these
measures, you may go home All the measures of
relief weie for the relief of the Government, and
there was no relief proposed for the people or the
country Mr E concluded by mov^ig to lay the
resolution on the table
Mr CAMBRELENG called for the yeas and
nays on this motion, which were ordered, and
were—yeas 89, nays 122, as follows
[The yeas and nays could not be obtained for
thismght'spaper The> willbe given on to-morrow ]
Without t iking the question on the adoption ot
the resolution, on motion of Mr C4MBRELLNG,
the House passed to the ciders of the. dav, and, on
motion of the same gentleman, then íesolved itself
into a Committee of the Whole on the slate of the
Union, Mi HAYNES in the chair, and resumed
the consideration of the bill to
POSTPONE THE., FOUR HI 1N3TALMLNT WITH THE
STATES
The question pending was on the amendment of
Mr PICKENS to stake flora the bill the indefinite
dause "till further pro viwon by law," and m*crl
" the nrst day of January, 1839 "
Mr WILLIAMS of Tennessee, who was enti-
tled to the floor, gave way to
Mr GARLAND of Vugima, who addies ed the
(omrmtteeat length 111 suppoit of the proportion
submitted by him some days since, (the same rs
Mi Itives's bill, introduced m th< Senate,)
arid in a leview of the Sub-Tu --sun si.Jii.nic
and   its   effect ,    Mr    G    ente ed   large li    nno
c't fence of the State banks, and qncvd *the
>pin ions of a numbar of distu gar*he I men
11 --upport of them The position he the 1
cecnpied was the «ime he had occupied when he
v as fiist elected to the House over his able pre-
decessor, (Mi Goidon) who hid pioposed the
1 leiHieil scheme now ucommended bv the Pre&i
dent of the United States Mi G had not changed,
aid should maintain   his position until   h s consti-
I lents instructed him out of it     He then went on
II show that the proposition he hid submittedwas a
sate and practical one, íepuhlican in its punciples,
a id oad the sanction of thp greatest minds of the
ce n tit Havmg addressed the House Joj up
warl oí two houis, he gave notice that he should
extend his remaiks in his prepared speech, and
then cite in full th< authorities he had baiely ad-
v erled to >n his rem-u I s on the floor                        [
Mr WILLIAMS 01 lennessee then obtained 1
the flooi, in I addressed the committee m opposi 1
tion to the bill withholding the payment of the
fourth instalment on the giou 1 that tt would
amount to the Violation of a contract The scheme
pioposed bv the Pres dent of the United States and
, the Secreiiij of the Treasuiy, he condemned m
tolo, as he also did the continuance of the State
bank svs*em All the niesmit embartassments he
ascribed to the conflict belvv e°n tee ¡ate edraimslra-
tion and th  E?nk of the Ui ted Stítes, m the te-
moval of the deposits &c and he held tint the
only cuie fd me existing evils would be the esta-
blishment of another bank
Mr UNDERWOOD give notice of an amend-
ment he intendel to move as a substitute for tne
bill providing that, in cas  the Treasury w ->s una-
ble to p->v the fourth instalment, the deficit should
be made up b/ selhng the bonds taken fiom the
Pennsylvania Bank of the Uuited States for the
stock of the late Bank of  he Jnit d States
Mr RARIDEN wished to give a brief statement
of the means which mil cert him to refrain from
suppoiting the bill Tie 1 id come to Corgios with
the firm de eimmat on of suppomng the admims-
ttitusn, ard he deemed it an nrpp ative duty to ex-
plain his motives, ¡est he should be charged with
reckless opposition It was v ith diffidence that an
humble individual 1 ee h mself ventured to diffei
from persons eievate on the pe^estpl ot superior
endowments, but h considered it incumbent on
him to pursue the c Jise he hid He did not con-
sider the object ot the bill was simplv to withhold
the fourth mstalme it of She surplus revenue fiom
the States This n as a faKe view of the case The
practical effect oí me bilí would be to take from the
States the amounh m hard mone> to which they
would be set erai , enti'Ied undei the dcpo5ite act
Some gentkmen aa considered the na ure 01 the
bill as that of a conflict 1 etv en the State and Ge-
neral Governm tils Fot his p ut, he did not view
it in that light In acting on this subject, he consi-
dered himself as much the aaem and friend of the
General Government as he was of the St-tie which
had sent him there. He could not comprehend
how the geneial Government could ha\e any
claims or uiteiest, at variance with those of the se-
veral States The General Government was the
creatuie of the States, they had bestowed upon it
all its energies for the performance of certain pui-
poses b n"fi(iai to the «hole Among others, the
Slate had investe 1 it v ith the pov*ei cf levying
taxes tor .he puipose of curving out the functions
and accomplish ng the ends they hid desigi ed it to
tulfii The ca <?, then, stood as io'lows If, from
accidental causes, more moi ey his been collected
than is leqmsiie, to w horn did that money \c\ovgl
Did it belong to the agent who had collected it, or to
the puncipqh from whom it had been collected1
H" looked upon it as the common pioperly of
the people, and to them it should be distributed
At the time Congress m-de the deposite law, it
considere d it caLul ited to piomot the interests an'
industry of the ( 01111 1 j Alone} w 3 the generatci
of enteipi se Had it lemitnpd locke 1 up in the
vaults of the Tj isun , it would have retarded en-
tctpnsc, but by distributing it ai ong the S"veial
States, it aecelentc ¡ ami stimulated that spirit, and

natme, ever ha 'e to err Such a íosult mi°ht
have been probable, but of tint t was unneces-
sary to speak then He compared the situation of
the deposite banks at  the  time  thev received  the
I money, with then subsequent sta c, aftei thej had
extended their issue to surh in unwairantabie ex-
tent, and concluded b\   declaim"' it as his firm opi-
nion, that whether the Treasury was full or not, it
was expedient to pay the money due to the Stales,
as it would do much good, and prevent much haim
Mi CUSHING then moved that the commi'tee
rise
Mr RHETT expiessed a hope tl &< the committee
would rise, and teport the bill and amendment to
the House
The CHAIR said the mot on could not be enter-
tained while an amendment was pending
The Committee refused to use—ayes 92, noes 98
Mr GUSHING then spoke m opposition to the
bill, taking the ground that the deposite act was a
contract, and that thelavv had devolved the íespon-
s bihty upon no Secretary of the Tieasury He
sad that the Government having uu oh ed them
in dimculties, he w ou'd not relieve it of le^pousiui 1-

Mi CUSHING then proceedcl m his exami-
nation of the Message He insistid upon it that
nothing had been proven to just if y the conv emng of
Congieos, nor to make out a cas  for the piopon-
tions undei consideiation. According to Mr C's
judgment, the fiist thing that ought to have been
retommended shou'd have been a direct loan, in-
stead of an issue m the shape of continental papei
On this topic, and on the causes of the p'cent em-
bairassment, hedvve't at some length, when he
agan gave wav to
Mr PiJPE, who moved that the committee use
lost—ayes 69 noes 79 , and
Mr CUSHIJTCr concluded his rematks at halt
pist seven o'clock, p m   when
Mr RHM I arose and made an earnest appeal
to the committee to take tne question c n the
amcilment, so that the bill mig'n be repo tod l>
the House He adverted to tne exu?ordm.iry
range h- debate bad ti en, and thought this
rai'uulfli bill fndbeen discussed long eno? "1
Mr MARi'lNsaid he had intended to Submit
somoie> ail s to the ccmmit'ee upon th s oil! but
tne Ue.icss, of t hour and the evident disposition
ol the conirriy.tee to take tre q íeslion, adt>toi Med
him to reftam He shou'd, tntie'bip, content
himself then with giving notice of his intention to
move to stuke out the proviso to the b 11
Mr WILLI IMS of North Carolina expressed
his d'sscnt to the whole b 11, as wc'l as 11 the
amendment The bill would be a violation of <he
public faith of tne Govel nment of the United States
pledged to the individual States to pa> this money
according to the provisions of the deposite act
That was the giound of the first objection
If thaf objection were well founded, did not the
amendment of fhe Gentleman from South Carolina
