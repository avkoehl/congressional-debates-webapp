No. 35. Report of Captain M. M. Gray, in charge of Torpedo Service.

CHARLESTON, S. C., August 12, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the state of my work from the 10th of July to date.

On the 11th July, I placed 57 shells of Rains' pattern at a distance of from 5 to 20 yards in front of Battery Wagner. I examined them after the assault of the 17th July, and found 20 of them exploded, many of them by the enemy's shells; others I found damaged by the heavy rains previous to that date. I then made others, water-proof, and of a much larger size, 3 15-inch shells containing 12 pounds and 44 33 to 40 pounds of powder each, making 47 shells, which are placed at a distance of from 20 to 250 yards in front of Battery Wagner.

On the night of the 9th instant, I undertook to place torpedoes at the mouth of Schooner Creek and near Marsh Battery, but found it impracticable, as the enemy had possession of the battery and were at work. I made another attempt on the 10th instant, and succeeded in putting down three, when I was discovered by the enemy, was compelled to leave, and was pursued as far as the telegraph posts.

I have on hand, for land service, 39; for ship-channel, 28; for Light-House Inlet, 30; in course of construction and near completion, 50; making total, 147 torpedoes. I have also on hand 44 submarine shells of Rains' pattern, which will be ready for use by the 20th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. M. GRAY,

Captain, in charge of Submarine Batteries.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
