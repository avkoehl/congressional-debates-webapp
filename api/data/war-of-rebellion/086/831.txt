General THOMAS EWING, Jr.:

I will expect the Forty-seventh [Missouri] to arrive from the outposts by to-morrow evening, and as soon as they arrive will ordered them forward. Some of them have to march fifty miles. With the force ordered to report to me, we can protect Southeast Missouri.

PILOT KNOB, December 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I will be able to send a small guard to Patterson. Will start them early in the morning. We will require about fifty men at Frederick-town and about seventy-five, at least, at Patterson. I will order Captain Hannahs' company to garrison the railroad, as I don't think it prudent to leave the large bridges unguarded. I don't think it absolutely necessary to garrison Farmington and Sainte Genevieve. I have ordered Company C, at Camp Grierson, to report to me. We have not men enough here to guard rebel prisoners and do necessary guard duty, but will do the best we can. I most sincerely hope you will succeed in having me relieved. I ask it for the good of the regiment I hope.

A. W. MAUPIN,

Colonel, Commanding.
