Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout—Mr, Fry.
Ho. of Reps.
tigations, got up, time after time, upon this Oppo-
sition cry of corruption ? In tiuth and in fact,
the people have heard so much, and realized so
little, that it would almost be difficult to make
them believe it if any did exist.
Two years ago, my friend from Virginia [Mr
Wise.] raised the cry of corruption' corruption ' in
every department, from the highest to the lowest
—from the soles of their feet to the crowns of their
heads—all was one common mass of corruption '
and he made large promises to the country, that if
this House would but give him a committee of in-
vestigation, he would exhibit to the people of this
country the iniquities of this Administration in
their pioper light Well, sir, this House gave him
his committee, and then he did not want it We'l,
but he had his committee,and had to go to work,
and what did he make out of it? What was the
corruption that he exhibited as existing in the Ex
ecutive Departments of this Government? None
Sir, he could show nothing And in order to divert
the attention ot the people from the fact that he
could show nothing, it became, as it seemed to me,
necessary to get up a row here with poor Reuben
M Whitney
Sir, I am, as much as any member of this House,
in favor of investigation, when theie is any reason
to believe necessity requoes it, but to the present
mode of raising investigating committees, 1 do de-
cidedly take exception Heie, if any of our Op
position fuends wish to íaisea pietext for abusing
the Administration, the} just get up a call foi in-
vestigation, and then, befoie any committee is ap-
pointed, or any action on the matter can be had, it
becomes the subject for weeks, day in and day out,
of abuse to the Admmistiation Why, sir, who
has ever denied 10 the Opposition a committee of
investigation when they asked for it' Nobody
Well, then, why not take a committee and go into
the examination at once, and if they can show to
the country that the Administration is corrupt,
then it would be time enough to abuse it Why
not, m the present case, ha\ e taken the committee
at once, and proceeded to ascertain the facts, and
then, if there was cause, abuse the Administration'
Certainly, all parties called foi this investigation,
nobody resisted it, and the people will inquiie, why
was it necessary that the half of the session should
be wasted in raising this committee? Why, sir, 1
will tell them it would be tiavelmg entnely out
of the ordinary course of things for the Opposition
to get a committee oí investigation without fiibt
abusing the Administration, and, in order that
they might havea pretext, in this case, to condemn
the Administration befoi e they ti y it, they ask the
House to adopt an entire new plan of rai&mg the
committee, and upon this pioposition they pour i
out their " vials of wiath " upon the Admimstia
tion, accuse and condemn itfrom beginning to end,
in advance of any investigation and then these
are the gentlemen who are afterwaids to sit as
judges in the matter
Well, sir, so be it I wish now to call the at-
tention of the House to one thing I wish to know
what this committee is to fnd out more than we
know alieady The facts connected with thisde
faication of Mr Swartwout, so as to explain the
transactions, and how it was consummated, I
think we have in the document laid upon our
tables from the President of the United States
And, sir, I propose now to go into an investí
gation of that matter from the documents m pos-
session of the House, and see what ground theie
is for the immense amount of censure and abuse
heaped upon the Secretary of the Tieasury con-
cerning this defalcation    Why, sir, the Secretary i
of the Treasury has, through the whole of this 'j
debate, been the victim of the most unielrnfing-,
violent, vindictive, and unjustifiable abu¡>e I ever
witnessed     Sir, he has been held up as worse
than Swartwout himself    My friend fiom Vir
gima [Mr  Wise] says this investigation should
have been raised    ith a view to his (Mr   Wood-
bury's)  impeachment,   arid,  sir, eveiything  is
uone that can be done to e\«te and lai&e up the
prejudices of the people against the Secretary o{
tie  TieaoUry   in   advance  of the investiga ion
But   sir, as 1 said, 1 propose to examine this mat
ter fiom tna documents, and g ve to the icoo e o<"
the country an honest and candid view of the ¡
case, a ¡d in doing this, I will say to W higs and
Anti-Masons, to Conservatives and to all parties,
m the language of an inspired writer, " Come and
let «s reason together "
Now, sir, I will read from document No. 13,
p 2    The Secretary of the Treasury says:
" During his (Swartwout's) continuance in
' office, the statements of his accounts, in a con-
' densed form, were made weekly to this Depart-
'ment, punctually, showing a balance tn his
' hands varying from a nominal sum to $100,000,
1 accord mg to circumstances and the season of the
' year "
Now, sir, if a collector sends in weekly state-
ments of his accounts with punctuality, with
nothing upon the faceof them to excite suspicion,
how is the Secretary of the Treasury to know of
anything wrong existing? What reason could he
have for suspecting Mr Swartwout was commit-
ting depredations upon the public money, when
his accounts were properly rendered? Why, sir,
it was impossible for him to know anything of it
Well, sir, you may then ask, how did Swartwout
get hold of all this money without the knowledge
of the Secretary of the Treasury? Why, sir, I
will refei you to the same document to show how
he got hold of it, and in what way he managed it
so as to elude the vigilance of the Treasury De
partmert. The Solicitor of the Treasury and the
First Comptroller, m their examinations, made
at the request of the Depai tment, after tins fiaud
was discovered, say, (p   24 )
" Accoiding to thestatements of Mr Ogden and
' Mr Phillips, the use of the public money began
' in 1830, the practice being to tiansfer,atthecom
' mencement of the week, to the Treasurer of the
' United States no more than the amount received
' previous to Saturday morning, and thus to re-
' place successively fiom the subsequent receipts
' thesums withdrawn, so that the deficiency might
' not appear "
Further, (page 48,) Mr  Phillips says
" By íefeience to the weekly returns, it will be
' seen that frequently large amounts were retained
' under the head ' amount due to the United States
' to be earned to the nextieturn,' which,in many
1 instances, would not be foi warded until Tuesday,
' in order that the collections of Saturdayand Mon
' day might place him in funds to make the trans
' fer from his account to that of the Treasuier of
' the United States "
And at page 20 of the same document, it is
further explained by Mr Ogden, who says, in his
examination
"That the weekly transfers to the Treasurer
' made by Swaitwout weie usually made on Mon
' day, but did not include the money received later
' than Saturday moinmg at ten o'clock, by which
1 means the receipts on bonds due Saturday and
' Sunday were embraced in the succeeding week,
' and thus, that amount, frequently fiom $150,000
' to |300,0UO, was entnely undei his conuol "
lie adds
" In this manner he retained the moneys, and
' was able to keep his transfer to the Treasury
1 apparently correct "
Now, su, there cannot be a doubt that th s was
the mode by which he possessed himself of the
money belonging to the Crovernment, and the
manner in which he was able to keep his trans
fers to the Treasury "'apparently coirect," and
thus entirely elude the vigilance of the Secretary
of the Tieasury The next inquiry will be, how
did the Secretary of the Treasury first ascertain
that Swartwout was using the public money?
Why, sir, fiom the same document (pages 2 and
3) wc learn that the last return, being foi the last
three days of Mr Swaitwout's term, showed over
§200,000 in his hands, this the Secretary of the
Treasury, deeming laiger than necessary, immedi-
ately dnects Mr Swartwout forthwith to deposit,
the one hair to tne credit of the Treasuier Mr
Swartwout declines to do so, and states that certain
custom house expenses remained to be paid, that
sui s had been commenced against him fora íeturn
of duties to alai ge amount, which, with numerous
pro ests filed agams him, would be sufficient to
swallow the whole balance, tl at he was individu-
ally liib e n those case&, and could not pi>y over
this bal nee until the/ were legally decided upon,
hat so soon as they were so decided, any balance
which then remained would be pro nptly paid over
The Secretary of the Treasury, however, immedi-
ately instituted further inquiry, through the So-
licitor of the Treasury and the First Comptroller,
which "resulted t  the impession that the facts and
the law relative to those suits and protests might jus-
tify a short delay "
Well, sir, does this exhibit anything like a want
of proper attention on the part of the Secretary of
the Treasury to the interests of the Government?
Does this show any failure on his part to watch
over the public money, and see that it was secured
to its rightful owner? No, sir But to proceed
further in ascertaining what led to the detection of
this defalcation The Secretary of the Treasury
says that—
" Subsequent disclosures made in November ex-
' cited the suspicions of the Department, not only
' as to that balance of $200,000, but a much larger
*  indebtedness, and the Solicitor of the Treasury
*  and the First Comptroller were forthwith sent to
'New York to ascertai n how the matter stood, and
' to institute a thorough investigation "
This was accordingly done, and the defalcation
found to be over $1,000,000, "whereupon suits
were forthwith instituted against the principal and
both his sureties The Solicitor of the Treasury
says in his letter (page 21) of the 10th of Novem-
ber
" That the urgent demand of the present col-
' lector [Mr Hoyt] for the abstracts and vouchers
' of Mi Swartwout't> last term, which were incom-
' plete for the want of his signature, and difficulty
' of obtaining them, fiist led to the suspicions com-
' municated by him to the Department "
Well, sir, here, then, is explained to you the
manner in which the Secretary of the Treasury
first gets to know of this defalcation of the col-
lector at New York I shall be told this pecula-
tion of the public money has been going on since
1830, and if the Secretary of the Treasury knew
nothing of it, did not any of the other officers in
the custom house at New York know of it ? Yes,
sir, they did knowof it Mr Ogden, the cashier,
anj Mr  Phillips, his assistant, knew ofit
Mr Og'den.m his examination befoie the Comp-
troller and Solicitor, states
" That he commenced abstracting the money
' m 1830 that, as the amount of the defalcation
' increased, he frequently spoke to Mr S on the
' subject, that about four years ago, the amount
' had got so laige that he told Mr S unless meas-
' uies were taken to reduce it, he could not con-
' sent to remain any longer in office with him.
'Mr S answered he had no doubt the operations
'in which he was engaged would enable him to
' ' pay off the deficiency,' and continued to give
'assurances to the last that he would soon pay it,
' and set all matters right "
Mr Ogden further states, (page 47 )
" That he and Mr Phillips had frequent conver-
' sations with Mr S on this subject, that they
' ur jed him to laise money elsewheic to pay up
' this balance, that, at Swartwout's lequest, they
' had an interview with him at his house, and that
' lit then assured them his speculations would soon
' enable him to pay all up "
Now, su, although it is certain that Mr Ogden,
the cashier, and Mr Phillips were aware of Mr
S 'a using the money belonging to the Govern-
ment, ye it is quite reasonable to suppose that
they, being in the office with him, ho'ding their
appointments, peihaps, at his will, would feel a
delicacy in exposing him immediately, ard that
he put them off from time to time by fair promises
that he would raise the money, make all right, and
that, by his art and cunning, and oft i epeated pi om-
lses and assuiances, he got the advantage of their
feelings, which allowed him to carry on his work
of plunderso as to avoid detection from the Tieas-
ury Department
Now, sir, I wish to call the attention of the
House to the largest item in this defalcation I
mean the bond account, which constitutes more
than one half of the whole amount And let gen-
tlemen charge the loss of that part of it to our
leg slation, and not to the mismanagement of the
Secretary of the Treasury
Sir, at the extra session of Congress, in October
la-st, Congress passed a law extending the time
for the payment of the merchants' bonds there,
for money due the Government for duties, nine
