Resurrection Notes—Mr. Jenifer.
H.o£ Reps.
Louisiana to his colleague, who sits near me, (Mr Garland ]
I understand from him that Mr Fitz has been long in the public
service, and bears a high charactei for integrity
[Mr Garland rose and said that Mr Fitz had been sent, at
an early period, (1806,) to Louisiana, by Mr Jcfflraon, and had,
since that time, continued in the land business, m the employ
ment of the Government He had never heard any imputation
on ¿ib character 3
Mr Robertson It is scarcely credible that any man of bad
character would have been appointed by Mr Jefferson, and
continued in guch an office under every succeeding administra
lion for thirty year's Would toGid theie weie .many such
officers in the public service aa Gideon Fitz Sir, it is because
his letters give evidence of integrity and ability that I have
brought them bo fully to the attention of this House 1 hey
are the official statements of a man thoroughly acquainted with
the subject, and of unquestionable veracity, and they aie of a
character to compel me to oppose the renewal of that system
■whose operation he hat shown to be eveiy way pernicious He
tells us its demoralizing effects have disgusted the community
and I concui with him in the hope he expresses that it wi.l
never be renewed
Gentlemen complain of the want of libeiahty on the part of
this Government, and of the original States, towards the West
These complaints, sn, have no just foundation
[Mr Prentiss disclaimed having made the charge ]
Mr Robertson I did not allude to the gentleman fium
Mississippi, but mora particularly to the remarks of the
gentleman from Missoun, [Mi Harrison J who gave us a
long list of grievances lit. spoke of large ^ums expended ior tlie
■benefit of the Atlantic States, on the Aimy, the Navy, fortifica
ttons,&c Sir, His not raj intention to state an account cur
rent, but let him who will engage in that task, and 1 am much
deceived if he does not find any thing but an ungeneious policy
pursued in reference to the new States Have gentlemen foi
gotten that Una Government has paid out of the common Tiea
fiury for Louisiana andFlond", principal and mteie^t, neaily
thirty millions ofdollats1? Tnat, m the last ten > ears alone, the
amount expended in extmgishmg Indian titles, and for defend
JDg the frontier settlements, ana othei matters connected with
the Indian department, is estimated by the chairman of Ways
andMeansat about 46 millions of dollars? Do they forget the
appropriation forthe Cumbeiland road, exceeding seven mil
lions of dollars, and almost exclusively a Western improve
mentí The grants for seats of Government, schools and col
leges, roads and canals'? Yes, sir, foi these objects, to say no
thing of large sums m money, this Government has bestowed
upon the new States betwee  14 and 15 millions ol acies of land
aquantity exceeding that which has been acquired by purchdbe
inlndtafia oi Illinois, and nearly equal to that sold m Ohio, and
now sustaining upwaida of a million ol inhabitants, while that
State which, un the express condition of enjoying a proportion
ate benefit, made a voluntary donation of the domain no v con
stitutiag those laige States, the State of Michigan, and the Tei
ritory of Wisconsin, has received an amount in money too
paltry to be mentioned, and not an acre of the im rtense region
which was once all her own Su, tho old States too have rivers
and roads to improve, and sons and dau >hters to educate It
ill becomes the West to complain of their injustice or lllitwr
ality, and its present condition alone furnishes conclusive proof
to repel the charge
Wearetoldef the great amount paid by the Western people
into the Treasury, for the public lands, and this is spoken of
as a drain of money from them Sir, those who paid for these
lands received moie than a lull equivalent, and far more than
a jWit proportion has tound its way back to them líut m
truth the dram was from the oíd ¡states, it is their population
and their wealth which has been diained, and w lu*h has made
the West what it is We, sir ca-mot but know that it is ow
ing to this cause, m part that compaiativeiy oui commerce
languishes and our fields are deserted Oui bro hers and oui
sons have been tempted to emigrate in seaich of fresher and
ncher lands But howevet, sir, this may affect our prosperity,
we can never cease to rejoice m theas, we can never forget
tiiat we are connected with them noli by ties of political asso
ciation merely, but oí blood, not harboi towauls them an un
just or unfriendly sentiment
Mr Chairman, it is the common mtere t of all that the pub
lie domain should not be wantonly sacrificed nor unjust!v ip
portioned In seeking to pievent tins, we manliest no hesti ity
to any section oí our cou ltiy It may suit the pu rpo-es of po
llticians to keep these questions open ltinij enable them as
has been said, to buy up votes But it concern-- every fi lend t1
that peace and harmony which shouldprev ai! amo íg us, to bring
about a speedy and satisfactory adjustment All that is wanting
to effect this is a mutual disposition to asbt.it no claim which ho
nor and conscience do not approve, let jio State urge unfound
ed pretensions to superior meiit ot exclusive title It does not
become the descendants of those who fought side by side m the
noblest of all causes—ths cause of hbeitv — to engage ma con
test for petty pecuniary advantages Ihe ouginal adjustment
of this vexed question by them, under encumstances of much
greater difficulty than those now piesented, affnids us an exam
pie well worthy to be followed They mdu'ged the hope, no
doubt, that they had laid the foundation of a lasting friendship
I fear, sir, that hope is not to be ipahzed, that their arrange
ments, on the contrary, just and liberal as they were, are to
prove the source of endunngenmitv The seed of discoid has
been sown among us, and the tree it aheady spuagmg, des
tmed unless we now cut it up by the loots to spread its
branches far and wide, and darken the face of our Union
Let the Representatives of the new States themselves come
forward with their pioposittons, divide the land** themselves,
or the proceeds beyond the wants of the Government, according
to the terms of then original compacts, or distribute them
among the People, on the punciple of the Georgia lotteiylaw ,
or dispose of them on any principles they maj deem mure
fair and etrsal They will not, lam confident, propose a sur
render to one or moie States exclusively, of what belongs
equally to all The States in which the lands he have no better
right thanotheis, nor would the new States themselves con
gent to such a proposition, should it ev-^r be ^euously made
In some of them nearly the wiule of the public domain has
been disposed of, and the money pilpinto the Tiea-suiy The
effect of the scheme alluded to, theietou would be to divide
the five or six millions ot teres lemamingm Ohio among up
wards of a million of inhabitants In Illinois and Indiana half
that number of inhabitants would ic*eive probably four times
the quantity of lands In Michigan, some eighty or one hunched
thousand persons would divide among them twenty orthnty
millions of acres,   and tho citizen? of Wisconsin, when ad
32
ímtted, would piobably share in a sMl! gteater dispropoition
This me mahty would nevei be tolerated among the new Matéis
ihemselves, leaving the clai is ú the ong u I Suites who'iy
out of view But hese claims cannot be wil mgly abandoned
Let the same benefits be extended to all 1 speak not, eir, of a
division scrupulously exact, ah to dolíais and cents oi acres,
or thousands of acres Iho&e totales which ha<.e all eady made
generuas saenhecs foi the public good will be reac'v again to
concur inalibeial polity Í can answer for one sir, which,
neglected, oppiessed as she has been by this Government, has
never besieged it with eleemosynary puitions for any peculiar
pnvilege or unjust advantages But, sir, no communities can
long subsist together which do not mutually observe justice
towards each othei It is not m the nature of man to submit
to glaring injustice pr wanton mjuiy Give us, then, some
measure that savors of equality , and let us settle, at once and
for ever, this disturbing question
SPEECH OF MR. JfeNIFER,
Of Maryland.
ZiiWie House of Representatives, Fuday  July 6,  183S—
On the bdl to piohlbit the íeissue of the notes of the Bank of
the United States
Mi ¡5PEAKE1 When I came into me Huu e; an houi since,
I was surprised to hear m/ fnend from Vngima, [Mr Wise J
discussing the merits of the bill now on youi table, or íathei I
was at a loss to know how that bill came theie at the piesent
time, knowing that various others had pieeedence on the calen
dar But upon learning the mannei m which it was brought
about, and knowing in who&e chaigethebUl had been placed
when it came from the Senate, I ceased to be a' ail astonished
I was aware tha' a political measure comdsetaMde parliamen
Ury rule in this. House whenever it might subserve the views
of the paity This bill, when it came horn the Senate, was
refeiredto the Committee on the J udioiary,'re-ported on by that
committee, andiefeired to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union Trom that moment, the Judiciary Commit
tee ceased to have any rightful contiolom it and before the
bill could be brought into the House out of i s oidei, it le
quued two thirds to suspend the lule foi that purpose 1 bi*?,
it is well known, could not have been obtained a id some im
direct means must he íesorted to, to do that which could not
bednectly got at Whenever the piesidmg officer of the
House ia disposed to connive at niegular pioceedmgs, it is a!
ways easy to find the means of accomplishing them and some
individual to piopose them
The chanman of the Judicial) Committee mj colleague
[Mi fnoMA's ] understands well parliamentaiy Manoeuvring,

not had the bill undei consideration one mo me it theyaiedis

the House, and the previous question demanded go that a bill,
which the Senate deemed of so much importance as to con
sume days in the consideration and diocussion of, was toiiave
been fuiced upon its pissage heie without a mamen s warn

were made beioie my colleague moved to di«chaige the Com

their own measures, contraiy to the consent of thepeople K
is the use of means to induce a violation of representative duty,
immoral in practice, and, m the language of President Jackson,
unless arrested by the people, "will lead to corruption and
bribery" I am sure, Mr Speaker, I am not misurlderstood,
recent events fully justify the language! have used That Ex

House to yield its assent to the various Sub Treasury plans re-
commended by the Executive, registered by the Senate, and
supported by the faithful here, this bill is sent to us from the
same body t! e ordinary courte of proceedings' departed from,
and by a tr e1 m 1 gislation is to be passed into a law, that the
Execu'ive vengeance may still pursue the Bank ef the United

Ihis bil originated with, and was, whilst m the Senate, under
the es¡ íai ehaige of a gentleman, (now no longer a member
of that uy, and, theiefore, it is not unparliamentary to speak
of him ; an active co operator and ^teadfatt adherent to Ex

stuue and now, at the close of the session, as Jus term oí

ingap omted Attorney Genei al of the United States,

esta tsjiment of abianch of the Bank of the United States at
\a ivdte, Tennessee, his place of residence, and now proposes,
by his bill, heavy penalties upon that Bank fot ibsuit g its own
not s This is the dying agony of Executive \ engeance against
t'iat institution After having deprived the countiy for so long
a period of all other sound circulating medium, the expiring ei-
foi t is made to drive out of circulation that w k ch is admitted
to be the best, that which the people have the most confidence
in, and which even you, Mr Speaker, prefer to any other I
mean the notes of the Bank of the United States They form
now, as they always have done, the best means of exchange
thioughout the whole coentjy
The time has gone by when the people will longer be deceiv
ed m reTation to this mattei But a few years since when all
the power of President Jackson's AdmimstiaLion was brought
to bear on the credit of the Bank of the United States, when it
would have cost any man his office to have been known to take
the notes of that bank m preference to tho e of the pet banks,
when the then toecieiaiy of the Tieasury, by a labored argu
ment, endeavored to pi ove that, as its charter appio*imated to
its end, us paper would be below par and cease to be a circu
latmg medium, at that veiy moment and up to the present, the
emce holders and politicians who were foremost m denouncing
that i witutton audits paper received then notes m preference
to any othei, and hoaided them up as gold and silver But
Pi e-ident Jackson *aid ih<a the Bank wat, msoh ei t and all his
sycophau s said it was eo \ et none believed it The pet bank"
g£Ms¡>«d the no es of the Bank oí the I usted fe a es and would
not pay them out, except asa maftei. offrvoi keeping them in
then vaults m preference to gold oi silvc I hete facts, in
rrtoic than one instance, I myself know I will here, Mr
Speaker, take occasion to mention a case which occurred dor
mg the l£panic" of 1834 A gentleman of high respectability
and ltuegiity of purpose* a warm, devoted Aiepd of General
Jackson residing in the country-, ha\ mg a considerable amount
of various banknotes m his possession, alarmed at the various
íumors he had heard, went to Baltimore to convert them into
specie Amongot o*her notes, he held some of the Bank of th*
United fetales Upon consulting with his Tackson friends there,
lu concluded to get ril of the United States Banknote^and
tak i i then stead those ol pet banks orlly He came to Wash
myon with hi^ pet bank money, and, after taVmg advice from
his fticnds here, although one of those banks at that time was in
fact the Tieasun, and the principal part of his notes were of
that bank he coti\eited them all into specie Finding, how
e\ei the inconvenience of *o much dead weight, befo e he re
tin tied home he resoited to the Bank of the United States, depo
& *ed his specie, and touL its notes into the countiy with him
I pon being askpd it hedistiusted the ppt banks he declared
that he did not, that he beaeved them to he perfectly safe and
sound Whv, then, i o you piefer the Bank of the United States?
I do no', but those who know more of the banks than I do ad
vibed me to do so This gentleman is still a warm friend of
General Jackson, though! believe he hag but little confidence
m his financial skill Sir this is not an isolate case, this is
not ihe only instance wheic politic ans have neld opinions and
u tdlan0uige oifici dand unofficial—to Gen íackson they de-
no meed the Bar-k to tlie people thev denounced its papel as
