MURFREESBOROUGH, January 23, 1863.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON:

Report says Forrest and Wheeler, with nearly 3,000 cavalry, are on the dirt road half-way between Rome and Versailles. Could you send General [J. C.] Davis to surprise them to-morrow morning by daylight, or a little later? Answer.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON,

Commanding Right Wing:

Your dispatch is received. The general commanding directs me to say to you, "All right; go ahead."

Respectfully,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.

Brigadier-General JOHNSON,

Commanding Right Wing:

The general commanding directs me to say that, from all he can learn, the enemy's cavalry have been gone to Franklin, and that General Davis shall take at least three days' rations to be able to follow them. He may find a small force at Unionville. Wheeler is in command as major-general. If this be true, and going prepared for it, he ought to go to Eagleville by to-morrow night, then, by Peytonsville pike, he should make Franklin by 3 o'clock day after to-morrow. If he can't do this, it would be better to take a day longer to make preparations, because I think the trip, in order to do good service, will require five days in all.

FRANK S. BOND,

Aide-de-Camp.

Brigadier-General JOHNSON:

In view of the state of the weather, and the creeks being up, the general commanding thinks General Davis had better not start until further orders, and then he had probably best go by way of Nolensville, taking all your trains with him. You had better not send any train to-morrow until this is decided.

FRANK S. BOND,

Aide-de-Camp.

Colonel [J. M.] HARLAN, La Vergne:
