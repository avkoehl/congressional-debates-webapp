June 3,
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I think we ought
to go on with the bill this evening.
Mr. SUMNER. It is not within the rale to
have a session to-night.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I think we ought
to finish the bill this evening.
Mr. POMEROY. Is it the purpose of the
Senator to have a session to-morrow if we do
not finish it to-night?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Yes, sir.
Mr. POMEROY. I think if we are to have
a session to-morrow perhaps it will not be
necessary to meet to-night.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Let us have a session
to-night and none to-morrow.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Let us have a
session to-morrow and none to-night.
Mr. ANTHONY. Let us have hot!,.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I hope we shall
have a session to-night.
Mr. SUMNER. I hope we shall not have an
evening session if we are to sit to-morrow.
Mr. POMEROY. I move that at half past
four o'clock to-day the Senate take a recess
until half past seven o'clock.
Hie VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Kansas asks unanimous consent to sub-
mit a motion that at half past four o'clock the
Senate take a recess until half past seven
o'clock.
Mr. SUMNER. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Massachusetts objects. The Senatorfrom
Kansas is still on the iloor. Does he move to
pass over the pending bill?
Mr. POMEROY. Yes, sir; I want to obtain
the sense of the Senate, and I therefore move
to pass over the pending bill, for the purpose
of entering that motion.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I move that the Senate
do now adjourn.
Mr. POMEROY.
the yeas and nays.
Mr. CAMERON".
Mr. EDMUNDS.
On that motion I call for
Mr. President 
—   Debate is not in order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion to
adjourn is not debatable. The Senator from
Vermont objects to debate.
Mr, CAMI3RON. But if the Senator from
Vermont will listen to mo for a moment 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Senators, as many
as are in favor 
Mr, CAMERON. Mr. President 
I he VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair can-
not recognize any Senator on the floor when the
Senator from Vermont insists on the motion to
adjourn, which is not debatable, and resumes
his seat.
Mr. CAMERON. I want to ask the Senator
from Vermont to give way to enable me to
move an executive session for the purpose of
referring some papers.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I withdraw the motion
for that purpose.
The VICE. PRESIDENT. The motion to
adjourn is withdrawn, and the Senator from
Pennsylvania now moves that the 'Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of executive business.
Mr. RICE. I ask the Senator from Penn-
sylvania to give way for a moment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I rise to a ques-
tion of order.
I he VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Maine rises to a question of order, which he
will state.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. The Senator from
Kansas moved that the appropriation bill be
passed over. The Senator from Vermont then
moved to adjourn but withdrew it. I submit
that the question now recurs on the motion of
the Senator from Kansas.
The VICE PRESIDENT. But the Senator
from Pennsylvania was upon the floor, claiming
the floor, and the Chair recognized hitn; and he
moved that the Senate proceed to the consid-
eration of executive business.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. "Was that motion
in order while the motion of the Senator from
Kansas was pending?
, The VICE PRESIDENT. By the new rule
motions to pass over or to place at the foot of
the Calendar are privileged motions, save as
against a motion to adjourn or to proceed to
the consideration of executive business. Those
two motions have priority of the motion to pass
over.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I hope we shall
not go into executive session now.
Mr. RICE. I wish to give notice of an
amendment to this bill, in case it is not dis-
posed of to-dav.
The VICE "PRESIDENT. The proposed
amendment will be referred to the Committee
on Appropriations. The question recurs on
the motion of the Senator from Pennsylvania,
that the Senate proceed to the consideration
of executive business.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I wish to say a
word on that subject.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Maine asks unanimous consent to make
a statement. The Chair hears no objection.
ill*. MORRILL, of Maine. I do not think
we ought to entertain that motion at the present
time. It is not quite fair at this hour in the
day, only a quarter past four o'clock, to enter-
tain any motion which is to throw the Senate
into disorder. I wish the Senate to consider
this question of adjourning, whether they will
go on to-night or whether they will give me to-
morrow to dispose of the appropriation bill ;
and if we have an executive session now. that
question will not be considered.
Mr. STE_WAIU\ I suppose that by going
into executive session now we decide to give
the Senator to-morrow for the appropriation
bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That is the effect of it.
Now I object to further debate.
Mr. STEWART. Au affirmative vote on
this motion will decide in favor of giving to-
morrow to the appropriation bill.
I he VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Vermont objects to further debate.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I think we ought
to settle that question now.
Mr. CAMERON. I hope the Senate will
agree to have an executive session at the pres-
ent time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the motion of the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania.
The motion was not agreeed to ; there being
on a division—ayes 16, noes 29.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question
recurs on the motion of the Senator from Kan-
sas, to pass over the pending bill.
Mr EDMUNDS. I move that the Senate
do now adjourn, in order to ascertain whether
we are to sit to-morrow or not.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I hope that
motion will not be agreed to.
The motion was not agreed to ; there being
on a division—ayes 17, noes 31.
Mr. POMEROY. I now ask for action on
my motion.
lbe VICE PRESIDENT. The question
recurs on the motion of the Senator from
Kansas to pass over the appropriation bill for
the purpose of entering a motion for an even-
ing session.
_ The motion was agreed to ; there being on a
division—ayes 25, noes 20.
Mr. POMEROY. I now move that at half
past four o'clock the Senate take a recess until
half past seven o'clock, with the distinct under-
standing that we are to go on with this appro-
priation bill in the evening.
Mr. SPENCER. And have no session to-
morrow.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I object to any under-
standing.
Mr. SUMNER. There is a rule that will
require us to go on with the general orders
to-night.
Mr. SPENCER. I move that when the
Senate adjourns, it adjourn to meet on Monday
Mr. SHERMAN. The motion for a recess
is not debatable.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Kansas moves that the Senate take a
recess at half past four o'clock until half past
seven o'clock, pendingwhich the Senator from
Alabama moves that when the Senate adjourns
to-day it adjourn to meet on Monday next.
That motion is in order and has priority. The
question is on the motion of the Senator from
Alabama.
The question being put; there were on a
division—ayes 28, noes 25.
Mr. STEWART. I call for the yeas and
nays. I think we ought to sit to-morrow.
Mr. TRUMBULL. This is a debatable
motion, I believe.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion to
adjourn over is debatable.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I wish to make a very
short speech upon ic, which will consist in say-
ing to the Senate that it is manifest we shall
do nothing to-night. Wo have got in that con-
dition when the Senate never docs any busi-
ness. We certainly ought to meet to-morrow
at this stage of the session. I therefore move
that the Senate adjourn.
Mr. SHERMAN. Let us have au executive
session first.
Mr. CAMERON. I trust that the Senator
from Illinois will allow me again to submit a
motion to go into executive session.
flhe VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Illinois moves that the Senate do now adjourn.
_ Mr. EDMUNDS and Mr. SPENCER. Ques-
tion !
Mr. SHERMAN. Is it in order now to move
for an executive session ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ It is not. It
would be if this motion to adjourn were not
pending.
Mr._ CAMERON. I ask the Senator from
Illinois to withdraw his motion.
Mr. TRUMBULL. We shall accomplish
nothing by staying here now.
Mr. CAMERON. We shall if yon will give
way.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
demanded by several Senators on the motion
to adjourn. Debate is not in order.
The motion was not agreed to ; there being,
on a division—ayes 2-1, noes 27.
Mr. SHERMAN. Now I move that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of execu-
tive business.
Mr. CAMERON. I hope that motion will
be agreed to.
Ihe VICE PRESIDENT. TheSenatorfrom
Ohio moves that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of executive business.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Does that take prece-
dence of a motion to adjourn over?
_ The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair thinks
it does.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I hope we shall
not go into executive session.
The VICE PRESIDENT. By the usage of
the Senate, a motion for an executive session
does take priority of a motion to adjourn over.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Is that question
debatable?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is not.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I hope the Sen-
ate will not go into executive session.
r'se to a Point of order.
n . ^^SIDENT. TheSenatorfrom
California rises to a point of order, which he
will state.
Mr. CASSERLY. There was a call for the
yeas and nays made by the Senator from Ne-
vada on the motion to adjourn over. Pend- '
mg that call, is a motion to go into executive
session in order?
Ihe VICE PRESIDENT. Certainly; just
as it would be if the yeas and nays had been
ordered.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Does that take prece-
dence of the motion for a recess, which is
another pending motion?
