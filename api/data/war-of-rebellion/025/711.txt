General STERLING PRICE:

Your dispatch received. I commenced march to Ripley this morning; will move slowly and meet you. Ross' division returned from Corinth to Bolivar on Monday last. Troops arriving Tuesday morning. They are preparing for some moves; can't learn yet what intention. This move was made in consequence of my advance toward that point. I send Jackson with 1,100 cavalry to-day to cut railroad between Corinth and Jackson, Tenn. He may thus take them in detail. One of my scouts reports quite a large force at Rienzi. Would you have transportation for the 5,000 returned prisoners if they should join you at Baldwyn or Guntown? Have you their arms with you? Waul's Texas Legion will soon join me-2,000 men. I get 8,000 prisoners, but no arms yet. I will write. I have sent out scouts to meet your cavalry.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

Major General STERLING PRICE,

Commanding Army of the West, Baldwyn:

GENERAL: One of my brigades has marched and will encamp to-night at Salem, on the Ripley road; the others will march to-morrow morning. I will probably reach Ripley a day or two before you. As you suggest, it is important that we should unite our forces. No better place than Ripley. The enemy are stronger than I had supposed, and it may be necessary for us to await the arrival of some of the exchanged prisoners.
