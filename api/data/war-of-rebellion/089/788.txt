GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Lieutenant General Grant's indorsement on my application to be relived from "my present command." I desire to call attention to the fact that I did not ask to be relieved from duty with the army. Under the circumstances I should have been better pleased to have served somewhere else, but I yield cheerfully to the general-in-chief's wishes, as expressed in the very handsome indorsement which he has placed upon my application.

I am, general, very respectfully,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
