HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS, May 25, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

I am in connection with Bartlett's brigade, Griffin's division, near the Anderson house, and have formed my lines nearly parallel to the road along which I came. I send this by an officer who is instructed to bring back the two brigades which were sent to establish the connection with Crawford last night. I shall keep up my connection with your right, and move with it.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 25, 1864-10 a.m.

General MEADE:

I inclose a sketch* of the position. The enemy has intrenchments visible on the railroad and on the river. Distance between about 1 mile. The intervening space is filled with skirmishers behind logs and trees. There are cavalry skirmishers along Little River south and west of us. General Wright is in position facing them. All along my front there is an open space between our skirmishers. I send you a sketch. I am going to ask General Wright to develop his line west across the Little River, and then go to the left of my line, push out a force to flank their skirmishers, and try and push them back with as little loss as I can. I think the enemy is in force.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
