General SULLIVAN:

I have just received the following letter from Captain Carter, First West Tennessee cavalry, who is near Clifton:

Colonel HAYNIE: I inform you from a source believed to be reliable that a force is to cross the river at Clifton, supposed to be Forrest's cavalry, said to be 3,000 strong.

The above was brought to me by Mr. Craven, of Craven's Landing,

who left home at 2 o'clock this a. m. I am under orders to report to General Grant immediately. I will turn over this command to Colonel Morrison this morning.
