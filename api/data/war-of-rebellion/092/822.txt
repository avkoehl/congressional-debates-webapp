The attention of the major-General commanding has of late been frequently called to the violation of orders concerning gambling. This offense, so criminal and detrimental to the interests of the service, must be stopped, and hereafter all offenders in this regard, whether commissioned officers or enlisted men, must be arrested and charges preferred against them. Upon discovery the offender shall be dispossessed of the moneys staked, which will be turned over to the provost-marshal's department. All division commanders, and officers of the inspector-General and provost-marshal departments, are particularly enjoined to be vigilant in the execution of this order. It is expected that regimental commanders will at all time be careful to discourage this growing evil. This order will be read at the head of every regiment, battery, and detachment in this command at the three successive dress parades immediately following its receipt. Officers in the quartermaster and commissary departments will also cause it to be read to all the enlisted men in their employment.
