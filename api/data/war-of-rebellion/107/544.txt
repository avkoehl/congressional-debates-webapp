Major General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN,

Washington:

The following dispatch comes from my provost-marshal who went up the road on business:

Only 300 men at New Creek. Patterson's Creek bridge beyond here on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad burned; said by neglect of guarding.

It is not the number of guards, but attention to guarding that seems called for. Ne rebel forces could reach that bridge without risk of capture. Information by letter about Big Sandy I sent you to-day.

I congratulate you on having possession of Charlestown. It is a good move. Please inform me, when circumstances enable you to determine, about what time you will be here.

General N. P. BANKS,

Sandy Hook:

I fear Lander has taken direct road to Bunker Hill instead of Martinsburg. I have endeavored to recall him, but fear it may be too late. He says he expects he may have a fight at Mill Springs Gap on 3d. Keep a sharp lookout. Hurry the march of Williasm, and be ready to assist Lander if he gets into trouble. Your best way to effect that, if you cannot march direct on Mill Springs Gap, would be a strong reconnaissance on Berryville. I still hope the order of recall will reach him in time.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN.

General MCCLELLAN:

General Lander has been sleeping under the influence of morphine foir twenty hours. A heavy snow-storm has set in, and if I do not receive orders to the contrary from Washington by 2 p. m. of this day I shall order Tyler and Mason back to camp, that their commands may not be exposed to the storm.
