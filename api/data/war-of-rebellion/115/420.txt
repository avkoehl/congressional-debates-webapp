Bunch, the British consul at Charleston, was arrested at my instance by military authority and committed for examination. This step was occasioned by a note of the 17th ultimo addressed to Mr. Cameron, the Secretary of War, by Simeon Draper, esq., chariman of the Union Defense Committee of New York, a copy of which is also inclosed. I then caused an examination of Quillen to be made by Cptain Goddard, the chief of the police here, a copy of which is also herewith.

Mr. Draper having been asked to send hither witnesses with a view to furthr proceedings agianst Quillen has replied that they could not leave New York, and as the offesne of the prisoner appears to have been committed in that city it is deemed advisable to transfer him thither. I have accoringly directed him to be trasnferred and placed in the custody of the marshal of the United States. It is desirable that he should be further examined at New York and if the result of the exaination should justify if that he should be neld for trial. Mr. Forrest, a clerk in this Department, towhom Quillen applied tohave his passport countersigned and who questioned him as to his object, takes this letter and his deposition in the matter may be imporrant. If the proof against Quillen should not warrant his detention for trial the memorandum book found upon him with the passport which he presented to be countersigned both may be returned.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

I will thank you to cause him to be transferred accordingly. This Department will de which the transfer may occasion.

I am, general, your obedient servant,
