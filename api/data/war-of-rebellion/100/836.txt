CHARLOTTE, N. C., April 24,1 865.

General B. BRAGG,

Chester, S. C.:

I hope even the small force with you will be effective in preventing those inrregularities to which I suppose you refer, and that your presence will secure good administration, now so important in the care and transportation of supplies. I expect to join you in a few dasy.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

GREENSBOROUGH, April 25, 1865.

Honorable J. C. BRECKINRDIGE,

Charlotte:

Your dispatch received. We have to save the people, spare the blood of the army, and save the high civil funcitionaries. Your plan, I think, can only do the last. We ought to prevent invasion, make terms for our troops, and give an escort of cavalry to the President, who ought to move without loss of a moment. Commanders believe the troops will not fight again. We think your plan impracticable. Major-General Wilson has captured Macon, with Major-Generals Cobb, Smith, (G. W.), and Brigadier-Generals Mackall and mercer, and garrison. Federal papers announce the capture of Mobile with 3,000 prisoners.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:

I have proposed to General Sherman military negotiations in regard to this army.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
