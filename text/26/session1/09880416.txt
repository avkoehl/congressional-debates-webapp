Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Montgomery.

press, and two against one million at the second
session of the Twenty fifth Congress. The state-
ment of the votes against these appropriations, for
which both parties voted, I here publish; and I
will here observe, that where the journals report a
unanimous vote, all are recorded for the measure,
and the absence of members from the House, or
behind the columns, or their refusal to vote, is net
noted, and is to be settled between them and their
constituents. I have taken ihe fioal vote on the
pas-sage of these bills as recorded on the journal-;
and if there ar? any m hese names are recorded for
them who have voted against them previously, I
can only fay that they have recorded their names
on both sides of the quest.on, and of course have
vo ei right once on the subject. It will be, there-
fore, a matter with them and thiir constituents to
settle which vote was the light one. With that I
have nothing to do.
I have charged that notwithstanding the Opposi-
tion had a majority in the Twenty-fit in CoDgre s,
and notwithstanding the loud and zealous preach-
ings of the Wh g party before the people about
thfir economy and our extravagance, we have
more votes recorded upon the journals against these
appropriations in that Congress than the Whigs
have. I have examined and ascertained that fact,
ana made out a list of al! that voted against each
bill, wiih the number of bill and prge on the jour-
nal when they passed, whiih I will publish in my
speech, to prove this charge to be true. Here
they stand as they were given and are rec rded; and
should any b? misstated, I will willingly correct the
error, when pointed out:
Appropriations made at the first session of ihe Twenty filth
Congress.

¿I $75,269 028 02
The above votes are all that are recotded against
any of the appropriation bills that pas,«ed the 25 h
Congress, on their final passage, at it* ihree sessions,
which amounted in all to 352 days, during which
time the Whigs an 1 their allies had thi piwer in
this House to control its lfgislation, as I have
proved by the jonrna's. What does this proof
amount to? Let us examine it for one moment.
The aggregate amount appropriated durirg that
Congress stands, as above stated, at $75,269,0:28 02;
and of that sum $66,085,459 54 (with the excep-
tion of six votes against ten, and two aga:nst one,
million) is recorded as having passsd unanimous-
ly, boih parties voting for it. There was also, of
this aggregate, about the sum of $9,168,832 90,
which was voted against by some of both parties,
but mostly by the Administration members, they
having given an aggregate vote of 148 against the
bills embracing this sum, and the Wh'gs having
Eivvn an aggregate vote, including the above men-
tioned, of 114 only. S-'e the above recordé! votes
published from the journals with the number of
the bills, their amounts, and the page upon the
journal when they passed. How, then, stands all
the Whig preaching about economy on their part,
and extravagance on ours, so loudly and so boldly
proclaimed before the people, and on this floor?
Which is the best and strongest proof, their votes
here recorded on the journals, or their loud decla-
rations before the people? They cannot both be
true, because they are precisely the opposites of
each other. Gentlemen may take either horn of
Ihe dilemma, and settle the matter with their con-
stituents, who sent them here, I presume, to prac
tise economy, and who have a
which is true and which is false.
As a further illustration, and in proof of what I
haTe charged upon these modern Federal bank
Whigs, who adhere so closely to their unfaithful
banks, and  who  preach  economy  to the peo-
54i',300 00
right  to decide
pie, and rr.ir.tise extravagance; who knowingly
I vote, as I hive shown, many millions more
! than the e>iimated and actual revenue, and
' refuse Treasury notes to meet the debts they have
thereby created. I have m ide out an account cur-
rent for a few of the leading and most rigid econo-
mists of that party, and who will be admitted as a
fair sample of the whole. I have, also, made out
an account current for all the members from my
own State, of whom there were eight Whigs and
five Republicans, in the Twenty fifth Congress;
and in making out this account, I have charged
them with the seventy-five m llions appropriated
during that Congress, «hile I hive given them
credi' for all that they stand recorded on the jour-
nals as voting against; and having struck the ba-
lance against fh;m, I have then given their votes
on tie Trtasury Note bi1!^, which shows the
amount of debt they created, and the amount of
means they provided to pay it. The accounts cur-
rent at the end of this speech.
Mr. Chairman, I do not complain of those who
voted for these appropriations, for I voted formo-d.
of them myself; but I do complain of those who
voted for them, and then denied their votes before
the people, casting al! the odium on the Republi-
can party, of ihos? Urge amounts voted out of the
people's money. There were good causes for most
of them, which I could satisfactorily demonstrate
to any and a'l true friends to their country. Gen
Jackson made from sixty to o:,e hundred treaties
with Indian tribes, by which upwards of one hun-
dred and twenty five millions of acre> of land were
acquired, for which ninety-hrc! millions of dol'ars
has been paid; (see vol. 4, Executive Documents,
3d S. 25 C. No. 164;) and thousands of Indians were
removed West. All these treaties were ratified by
a Federal Whiz Senate, opposed to him, and by a
vote of iwc-thirds,  o that the Whigs had the pow-
er always to reject them, if disposed to io so. We
were then, in the House, bound to make the appro-
priations to pay the cost of these treaties, and
both parties in this and the other House vo'ed
for them. The Indian wars cost us much mo-
ney, and both parties voted for them.
By the  act of 1836 for the reorganization of the
Post Office Department,  the funds of that Depart-
ment were put into the appropriations, which was
not done previous to'that time, but they form no part
of the  burdens imposed upon the people.   It is
only the revenues of that Department which  are
applied to keep up and extend the mail accommo-
dating for the people.   Your pension list has risen
from half a million to near three and a half mil-
lions,  and all parties voted for the laws which so
enormously  increased this list.   By  act of 1836,
ttventy-eght millions were   give   to the  Sates.
Now I voted for these laws because I thought them
proper and just; and having done so, I never will,
(like the Whigs,) after creating a debt, refuse to
pay it, andabusj innocent men  for what I did my-
self.   The Wh'g party voted these large sums out
of the Treasury,  and thereby compelled Mr. Van
Buren  to apply them according to their ewn laws;
and yet when he obeyed  them, they  denounced   ¡
him for it.    He has not spent all th«   money they   .
voted  him  during the last two years by nearly  .
fifteen million of dollars, (see unexpended balance;   ¡,
for   1838 and '39,)  and  yet   they   heap  curs.s  ,"
on  him because he  does not bring down  the  ex-
penses of the Government, and when he recommends
a reduction of five or six millions, as he has at the   ;
present session, (for which see his message)  they
loud  and furiously denounce him for doing just    ''
what they asked him to do.   Does not this show   '■
that they are determined to oppose him in all cases
and under every circumstance?   Some abuse him    '
for expenditures on the roads, some for expendi-
tures on harbors, some for expenditures on rivers,
and some for expenditures on light-houses.   Some
abuse him on account of post routes and post mas-   ";
ters, (see Gov. Dudley's message to the last Assem-   '■;
bly,) and, in short, every thing under Heaven, rea-
'r-easonable or unreasonable. Yes, sir; for the work
of their own hands and heads.   This same kind
of opposition was made to the administration of    :
Washington as well as to that of every Democratic   ;"
Administration since his day.   There was a fac-    ¡
tious spirit always operating against them, right or
wrong.   Just so now.
