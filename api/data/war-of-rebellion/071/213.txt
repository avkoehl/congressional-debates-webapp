BALTIMORE, MD., July 11, 1864.

(Received 1. 15 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have just received the following dispatch from General Ricketts, which makes affairs begin to look serious:

ELLICOTT'S MILLS, MD., 10. 30 a. m.

Captain MAX. WOODHULL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain MAX. WOODHULL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Numbers, First Eastern Shore Volunteers, at Elysville, reports the enemy's cavalry in large force within five miles of that place. Lieutenant Garey, of his command, set out with a squad, met a marauding party, taking 2 prisoners and horses, and killing 1 lieutenant. The mounted infantry under my command are insufficient and unfit to acquire information. At least a regiment of cavalry is needed. I am sending infantry force to check all advance. The presence of the enemy is also reported at Randallstown at 8 a. m.

Very respectfully,

JAS. B. RICKETTS,

Brigadier-General.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

The panic here is heavy and increasing. Do not think there is just cause for it. I have not enough cavalry to picket the several approaches or to send out reconnoitering squads, and, therefore, beg you will give attention to a dispatch from me of yesterday, giving a note received from Colonel Clendenin, touching his dismounted men. I can mount them if you will be kind enough to order them to me.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 11, 1864-1. 20 p. m.

Major-General WALLACE, Baltimore, Md.:

Keep horses enough to mount all your dismounted men. Dismounted men here have been sent to the field. We cannot give them to you. The main body of the enemy appears to be in our front.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 11, 1864.

(Received 2 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I left General Ricketts at Ellicott's Mills, in compliance with your orders, to retard the progress of the enemy toward Baltimore. He has just sent me the following telegram, on the strength of which I have ordered him to the city at once. I also sent two regiments of Ricketts' division to the Relay House, on the Washington railroad.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.
