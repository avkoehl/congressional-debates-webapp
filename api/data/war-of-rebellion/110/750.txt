Would it not be better for me to move a part, if not all, of my division down there as soon as General Armstrong can relieve me here with one of his brigades, and thus be in position to drive the enemy back should he attempt to cross?

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Captain E. T. SYKES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Enemy made a bridge on Sweetwater above this point last night, and under cover of artillery have crossed aheavy cavalry force. The length of my line and the absence of Colonel Inge's regiment necessitates re-enforcements. I have only about 600 fighting men. Yours, &amp;c.,

HEADQUARTERS FERGUSON'S BRIGADE,One Mile west Salt Srings, on Villa Rica Road, October 2, 1864 - 10.15 a. m.

Captain E. T. SYKES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The enemy, undercover of artillery and dismounted cavalry, threw a bridge over Sweetwater last night, crossed this morning, and after moving his force, cavalry as far as known, movedupon me and drove me back to this point, flanking on both sides. This movements leaves my pickets on the lower Sweetwater exposed, and I have concentrated them at Alexander's Mill. I do not think Ican hold my position if attacked. I can only bring into a fight about 400 men in front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. BOYLES,

Colonel, Commanding.
