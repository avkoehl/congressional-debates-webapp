I have suggested to General Sam. Jones that his infantry might join you at Monterey or such other point as you may designate. The enemy's attention in the Kanawha Valley has already been drawn to the counties west of that river and toward Northern Kentucky.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant.

Major General J. E. B. STUART,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: Your letter, inclosing General Fitz. Lee's report* of the battle at Kelly's Ford, with accompanying documents, has been received. I am much gratified at the noble conduct of the officers and men in repulsing a greatly superior force of the enemy, and compelling them to give up the attempt to strike a blow at our line of communication. The reports have been forwarded for the information of the Department, and as an evidence of the merit and gallantry of Fitz. Lee and his brigade. I regret with you the loss of our noble dead, and concur in your commendations of the living.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Colonel J. F. GILMER, Chief Engineer, C. S. Army:

COLONEL: On the 6th instant I requested that you would send an engineer officer to report to General Lontgstreet, at Petersburg, who was in need of a good reconnoitering officer, and I had none to send him. General Longstreet reports to me to-day that no officer has yet arrived; that he is without proper maps of that region of country, and has no one to procure him the necessary information. I hope you will be able to supply him without delay. Yesterday Lieutenant [Thomas T. L.] Snead, of the Engineers, reported to me for duty, and about two weeks ago Captain [C. R.] Collins. I would send him either or both, if they are qualified for that duty, but I am unacquainted with their qualifications. If I had an experienced engineer capable of conducting the professional operations of that department in this army, young officers could be advantageously employed, but as I am now situated they give no assistance, and you may possibly require them elsewhere.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
