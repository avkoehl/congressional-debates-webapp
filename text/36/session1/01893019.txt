" Now, rails from Cardiff can be put in New Orleans at
this time for less than $40 per ton, duty paid. We could
not do this, unless we put the iron at $33 50 per ton, which
is simply an utter impossibility."
I have another statement, from the same gen-
tleman, showing the production and consumption
of iron in the United States for the year 1856,
in which, as will be seen, the question is pre-
sented in its economical as well as its statistical
aspect:

The above figures are all inside of the actual facts, and
will be sate to stand on. An accurate detailed statement,
which, I take it. you do not expect nf me at this time,
would add laigel'y'to some of the above aggregates.
In order to show the relation existing between
the productive interests and all other branches
of industry, I desire to present the following state-
ment of the tonnage furnished the Reading rail-
road and Schuykili canal from a single manufac-
turing establishment in one year:

" In addition to the above there was a considerable ton-
nage of merchandise, such as oil, brass, steel, rope, hard-
ware, &c., used at the works.
" The town of Phoenix vdie contains over six thousand in-
habitants who are dependent on the iron works; and what-
ever transportation and passenger business they afford js
indirectly due to the fact that the manufacture of iron is
earned on at this point.
" The quantity of rails and bar iron manufactured at the
Phosnix woiks in the year 1859 was 24.350 tons of 2.240
lbs. each, so that the transportation on the Reading railroad
and the Schuylkill navigation of raw materials (sajing noth-
ing of the hauling done m wagons by nearly 200 hordes and
mules) was 5} tons for each ton of manufactured iron.
ki The freight to the Reading railroad alone on the above
*/5.02t tons exceeded $98,000.
" This fact will «ervc to show how important to transpor-
tation companies is the development of the iron business.
'•The Phccmx fron Works could have supplied fifty per
cent, more manufactured iron duiing the past ycai it the
orders could have been obtained. Of course, in that case,
the tonnage of raw materials would have been correspond-
ingly increased."
1 also desire to submit, in this connection, a
statement of the cost of importing iron under the
present tariff, (1857,) furnished By the old and
highly respectable house of E. J. Etting & J3ro.s
importers of iron, in the city of Philadelphia.
This iron is for an invoice ordered of factors in
Liverpool, and the statement will be seen to con-
flict seriously with that obtained of the foreign
importer, by the Senator from Virginia. Here is
the statement:

In concluding my remarks on this branch of
the (subject, I will here present a tabular state-
ment showing the quantity of railroad iron im-
ported into the United States, with the yearly
8 63
Thirty per cent, equal to $10 43 per ton.
1854 to 1859, both inclusive, 6 years, quantity, 830,695 tons.
Appraised value, $35,910,693.
Average price per ton, $40 32.
Thirty per ccnt. equal to $12 10 per ton.
From this it appears that §51 01 per ton was
the maximum price of rails on shipboard be-
tween the years 1847 and 1859, inclusive. This,
with an ad valorem duty of thirty per ccnt. yielded
a revenue of §15 30 per ton; making the cost of
the iron here §66 31. But, on referring to the
table, we find the price of iron to have fallen to
$26 03, in 1851, with a duty of only $7 80; thus
showing that when we need the most protection
we get the least under the operation of ad valorem
duties. A specific duty in any one of those years
would have prevented the depressions in our busi-
ness and the prostration of the industry of tho
entire country in consequence. Taking, as set
down in the statement just submitted, the aver-
age cost of railroad iron per ton, it will be seen
that, under the ad valorem duty of thirty per cent,
the duty per ton was §12 10; or ten ccnts more
than the specific duty proposed in the Morrill
bill.
1 have many more statements of a kindred
nature among my memoranda, but will not ex-
haust the patience of the Senate in reading more
of them at this time. I will only inquire, if the
bill is not right, why do not the chairman of tho
Committee on Finance and his political friends
alter or amend it? I will vote for any bill which
proposes substantial protection to the prostrate
and suffering labor of my State, come from what
quarter it may. It will not do for them to plead
want of time. The bill came from the House on
the 12th of May, having received the sanction and
approval of a large majority of that body, com-
posed of men of all parties. During all that time,
the Senator from Virginia and his political friends
have had entire control of the legislation of the
Senate. I am satisfied that all the Senators on
this side of the Chamber will consent to remain
long enough to give them full time to pass a bill
affording more revenue, and incorporating the
principle of protection. There may be gentlemen
who are not in favor of protection, who desire a
tariff for revenue purposes only ; but, sir, I am in
favor of protection as the object, and revenue as
the incident. I hold that it is but fair, that our
labor shoirld be protected against custom-house
frauds, and against the pauper labor of Europe.
I recall two or three cases just now, going to show
how much less reward labor commands and re-
ceives in England than here. Until within the
Inst few years, nearly all the wood-screws used
in the world, and certainly in this country, were
made in our own workshops. Recently, how-
ever, some one of our numerous inventors invent-
ed a machine making a decided improvement, by
adding a gimlet to the end of the screw. He went
to England, and disposed of his patent there.
British capitalists seized upon it, put it in opera-
tion, and now the wood-screw manufactories of
this country arc forced to suspend, and England
furnishes us with that article. The reason is that
the machine can be worked by little girls, obtained
fiom the almshouses; paupers from the streets
and poorhouses, and vagrants from the lanes^and
alleys, are brought in to work at low wages. They
not only supply the home market, but come here
and glut our market, to the exclusion of our own
artisans. Not this branch of business is a very
largo one, foimcrly giving employment and sup-
port to thousands of our honest laborers. We
had a right to its continuance, for the invention
