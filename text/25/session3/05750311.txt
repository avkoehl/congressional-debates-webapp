Maine Boundary Questions-Mr. Davis.
Senate.
right and duty, and, on that ground, this clause
is right, and should not be stricken out
Again I would not strike it out because, on
the ppint of a conflict, it takes the true and just
ground on which this great nation ought to stand
in view of the country m all our conflicts with
other Powers We ought to be ready at any
moment to declare the great principles on which
we act, not only in relation to ourselves, but to
all mankind, and we ought to take the ground
assumed by this resolution, because it rests on
the Constitution of the country, and on a great
principle of common justice, since it may save us
hom difficulties which may hereafter arise in íe-
gard to the States of this Union
The Constitution, in regard to the defense of
this country, has been referred to, and I feel the
obligation imposed on us by the Constitution.
But if that were white papei, patriotism alone
would call me to thedefense of the United States,
when assailed by a common enemy But I think
Senators have mistaken both the Constitution and
this resolution The resolution does not say we
will not protect Maine when invaded No, sir,
and no one could have the heart to say that he
would, in such a case, hesitate a single moment
in yielding the last drop of his blood But it says
that when a foreign army is withdrawn, if Maine
will not also consent to wuhdiaw, she is not to
loolc to us to protect her then in her improper
couise And this is done on great principles of
justice
Is the peace of this country to be put into the
hands of an individual State of this Union' Are
the States all to he bound by the decisions of one
on the question of peace or war' >No, sir, that
question is a common question for the Union
itself, and I am not willing that it should be de-
cided by any one or two 01 ten of the States of
this Union I then regard that resolution as true
in respect to the Constitution of the country, and
it is demanded in justice to the world that we
should pioclaim it
What is now our position in regard to all the
world of nations' We are twenty-six United
States, and is it not due to the world to proclaim
that no one of them shall bring us into a war,
and that the whole will not yield to any low and
firecipitate impulse of a part' I believe the dec
aration would be received in Europe as a decla-
ration of common sense and common justice, that
the whole people must decide on questions of
isuch importance to us and to other Poweis, and
they would have confidence in the proceedings of
this Government, which they cannot have with-
out such asbUiance But let them understand,
on the comiaiy, that of the twenty six States,
any one can dcteimine what aie then lights, and
that theie cannot be then an appeal to the judg-
ment of the whole Union, and wheie then would
be thou confidence in us Let thtm but under
stand that wc follow the lead, in these high mat
iei s, of i small poiHon of tne United States, and
all confidenc m this Government by foreign
Poweis will be at once withdrawn, and the Gov
einment of Euiope will feel that there is no safety
m holding any mteicourse with us We ought,
therefoie, to declare that no sepílate poition of
the United States shall be prirouted to inteifere
and contiol our lelations with foiugn Govern-
ments, but that it shall be done by all the people
of all the United States
But it is said this resolution looks like a threat
to the State of Maine No, sn , we aie not in the
habit of threatening the members of the Confed-
eracy, and we have no inducement to hold out to
the feeblest a threat that if she will not do as we
choose we will punish her But we have a right
to do this—and I hope we shall do it, not only in
íegard to the feeblest, but the strongest—that is,
to dec'are to them that we aie to judge when we
are to be brought into a war with a foreign Gov-
ernment, and we will not let you decide that ques
tion foi us I believe Maine is right, and her
adversary wrong, and nothing has surpused me
more than a d mbt of the light of Maine on the
tieaty of 1783 If geography is right, if the
mathematics is light, then is Maine right in this
contiovetsy with a foreign Government, and if
the Executive is as decided with Great Britain as
Congress is unanimous on this subject, that Gov-
ernment has too much of a sense of justice much
longer to refuse to yield I say this, that Mame
may undeistand that while my views aie such as
I have expressed, I have not a doubt of her right
to this ten ltory And if, in the further results of
this matter, the rights of Mame shall still be de
nied by Great Britain, I have nothing further to
offer, except my aid in the conflict, and of that
Maine shall have all But I would not enter into
a foreign war without the exercise of our own
judgment
This high moral position I desire this Govern-
ment to assume, that we may do justice to Gieat
Bntam But let not Maine, if New Brunswick
withdraws her force, still persist in retaining her
foice in the disputed teintory, and that is all the
resolution asserts, that if Great Britain withdi aw,
Maine is to withdraw, and further, that it is to
be by the common consent of the whole people
of this nation whenever we enter into a war
And I will say, as was once said of Great Bnt-
ain, let this country be but true to herself, and
let the four corners of the earth come, and she
will foil them Sir, this is no insult to Maine
The passions and prejudices of Maine have been
aroused by the delays of Government, but all
this is to be forgotten, and we are now to act
simply on what is before us.
Mi BENTON was opposed to this fourth res-
olution reported by the Committee on Foreign
Relations He looked upon it as involving both
an unconstitutionality and an impossibility. The
Union was a unit—a single body—and no part
of it could be stiuck without every part feeling
the blow The General Government was ere
ated foi the common defense, and was charged
with the whole business of our foreign relations
It is for the General Government to settle all
questions with foreign nations, and it is to this
Government that foreign nations must look foi
the settlement of all questions They cannot
deal with a single State, neither amicably by ne
gotiation, nor hostilely by arms If Maine does
wrong to Gieat Britain, the application for re
dress must be to tins Government If it be wrong,
and this Government does not redress it, it as
sumes it It makes the aggression of Maine its
own aggiession This is our Constitution, this
is a pnncipal, and this the main object of the
Union We have formed a Union foi the com-
mon defense, and the States have submitted to
that Union the decision of all questions which the
State or their citizens can have with foreign Pow
eis The Congiess is the council of the Union,
it is bound to take cognizance of the wrongs of
every part of the Union, and to decide upon every
question If a State is in the wrong with respect
! to a foieign Power, it must desist, if in the right,
it must be sustainel It cannot be abandoned to
a contest with that foreign Power We cannot
stand by and see that Power chastise it' The
Constitution forbids this
It íequnes the whole Union to give aid and
succor to each State While in the Union it must
be defended, while in the Union its rcsouices are
in the hands of the Federal Government, and
neutiality, oí non interference, is an impossible
state for this Government Impossible undei the
Constitution, impossible in point of fact Im-
possible in point of fact for the revenues of the
State are in our hands, her forts and magazines
aie in oui hanus, her sinews of war aie in oui
hands, and before we can be neutial we must
restore hei resouices, we must give up hei cus-
tom houses, forts, magazines, and her share of
the fleet To retain these in our hands, while
she combats naked and empty-handed with a
foreign Power, will not be neutrality and non
interference, but will be aid and interference on
the opposite side it will be aiding the foreign
Power by disabling the State   The whole thing
is impossible—as impossible as it would be un-
constitutional, and the contingent inaction of this
Government in the case supposed m the íesolu-
tion is clearly and manifestly an error, which
cannot stand the test of the Constitution or of
events The Senate should reject the resolution
It may lead to erroneous and unfoitunate con-
clusions abroad, and will not be sanctioned at
home It may induce theBiitish Government to
suppose that a state of things may arise in which
they may have to deal witn Maine alone, and to
induce them to act upon that supposition    Fatal
to the peace of the two countries would be that
supposition and that action' Right or wrong,
Maine cannot be struck by the British1 IP she
is struck, every State in the Union is struck*
Every one will feel the blow, and every one will
come to her aid The far West and the extreme
South will feel the blow, and will join in repelling
or avenging it This would be the inevitable re-
sult Let the resolution, then, be rejected Let
the Federal Government take charge of the con-
troversy, and proceed to settle it with Great
Britain Let this Government do its part, as the
supreme head of the Confederacy, and hold itself
ready to act its part in any consequences that
may ensue
Mr DAVIS said- After reading this resolution,
I -find myself disappointed, and I am not well rec-
onciled to some other parts of the resolutions. I
am reluctant to raise objections against them, be-
cause I know they were drawn up with the best
of motives
I do not doubt that we are to regard that agree-
ment which has been so much spoken of, "but I
will say this that that agreement was made for
a temporary purpose, and only to endure while
negotiations were pending I suppose it did exist
by a pi oposition made on the one side, and by an
accession to that pioposition on the other side I
had occasion to íemark the other day, and the
documents will show, that Gieat Britain declared
the negotiation at an end, in which oui Secretary
ofStateconcuned And was not thisbaigam then
at an end' What is the sub]ect of the piotocol,
(memorandum ') It is, that Great Bi itain alleges
I a new agí cement that we deny, and we theiefore
piopose now to entei into a new agreement And
what good will it do to renew what was given up
by the Executive ' I can foiesee no good from it,
and theie may be evil
But this resolution is yet more important, and
involves a principle of higher consideration Ido
not view it as others, in the nature of a threat, but
I view it as involving a constitutional power and
duty of this Goveinment, and as declaring to
Maine and the world that this Government has
the right, in certain contingencies, to withhold its
protection from Maine Let us look at it in that
important aspect and now what is our constitu
tional duty' I will read from the Constitution,
in the tenth section
' No State shall, without the consent of Congiess, Jay
any duty ol tonnage, keep troops or ships of war m time of
peace, enter into any agreemtnt or compact with another
btale or with a foreign Power or engage in war, unless  ac
tu illy invaded, or in such imminent danger a¡> w di not admit
of delay   '
And now let us look at section four of the
fourth diticle
' J he Omted ¡Mites shall guarantee to every State in tins
Union a ripubliean torni ol L,>vcinrnent and «hail protect
<achof them a^unit Division and, on application of the
Í egi latlire or of the Incentive (when the ¡Legislature
cannot be convened,) against domestic violence "
Against invasion and domestic violence ' Let
us suppose a case, for example, that the people
of Canada come across the river at Detroit for the
purpose of invading Michigan, is thete any doubt
of the authority of Michigan to repel them' Is
it not within the terms of the Constitution itself'
Nothing is flainer than that the State has this
power, and it would be its duty to exeicise it,
even if it were not in the Constitution And if ail
this is so. it is plain that it is the duty of this
Government not only to defend its own rights,
but to sustain the jurisdiction of Michigan as a
member of the Confederacy
And now let us look at Maine The Senators
from Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Kentucky,
declare that there is not a shadow of doubt as to
the light of Maine to this territory, that the line
marked out by the tipaty is so clear and evident,
that there cannot be a doubt on the subject in the
mind of any reasonable man And have we not
the authonty of this body by a unanimous de-
cision that such is the fact' Whose, then, is this
teiritoiy' It is pait and paicel of the State of
Maine by the opinion of eveiybody And what
right, then, has Gieat Bi itain to touch it Is it
not, in fact and in truth, an invasion of the State
of Maine' And are you prepared, if Maine insist
on what the Constitution imposes on you as a
duty and an obligation—are you prepaied to say
to Maine, youi territory is not invaded'   And
