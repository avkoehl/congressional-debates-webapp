sustained by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Gabfieij),] who says he thought it of so much
importance that be sent out last year to the
Committee on the Judiciary, and it is sent there
now because they have not had time to consider
it, and perhaps no one has brought* it to their
attention. But now that this matter is before
the House and before the country, independent
of all feeling, laying aside all the hard words
that have been used about it, and doing every-
thing, as I always try to do as far as I can, for
the good of the country, I conjure the House
of Representatives to send this question to a
committee that can report at any time, as the
Judiciary may not, in order that vvc may have
legislation to define our rights and the rights
of the Senate, so that this thing which hap-
pened yesterday may never happen again.
Whether I am responsible forthe sceneliere
yesterday or not, if its results are that we have
legislation to sustain and fortify this part, which
every man upon this floor knows to be, as
Judge Story and Judge Kent both say, is the
weak spot in our Constitution ; if the result of
the scene of yesterday shall be that now when
there is no presidential election pending, and
when there can be no possible motive for us to
do wrong, but every motive to do right and to
do the best for the country; if by that scene
or by anything that has occurred we have so
attracted the attention of the country, so at-
tracted the attention of the House, and so at-
tracted the attention of the Senate to this great
defect in our Constitution, which the Speaker
has characterized as casus omissus, can be
remedied; if this committee, of which I hope
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Sheliabarger]
will be one, can devise legislation which shall
save the country from revolution in its hour of
future peril, then I shall have deserved well in
what I have done and all I have done in this
behalf in my own conscience and in my own
heart, whatever either of praise or blame may
be accorded me by others, for I shall have
aided to throw around the Constitution safe-
guards and buttresses to render it stronger for-
ever, and there will have arisen a great good
out of the " spirit of hell," in whatever heart
it may have been found.
Mr. LOGAN. I now yield five minutes to
the gentleman from New Hampshire, [Mr.
Denton.]
The SPEAKERjpro tempore. The Chair will
state that in three minutes from now the House
will take a recess.
Mr. LOGAN. Well, I yield the gentleman
that time.
Mr. BENTON. I have no time in three
minutes to make any argument, in this case, but
it seems to me, although there is a disagree-
ment between skilled and able gentlemen here,
that there ought to be but little disagreement in
this House as to the propositions advanced by
the gentleman from Massachusetts. How was
it, Mr. Speaker, yesterday, when the House
was called upon to vote? When the question
was submitted to the House a vote of 150 was
recorded that that concurrent resolution was
not binding upon the House.
It, was true that after the return of the Sen-
ate the Presiding Officer notified the joint con-
vention that the Senate had overruled the ob-
jection taken by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, and upon that proceeded to direct the
votes to be counted and declared. Now here
was not a question of order, but a question of
substance as to the extent and effect of that
concurrent resolution, and upon (hat question
the Senate were upon one side and the House
upon the other. Was it for the Senate to de-
clare that they were right and that the House
was wrong? That was the effect of what they
did. And was not the declaration of the Pre-
siding Officer, declaring that that objection was
not well taken and was overruled by the Sen-
ate, a proceeding calculated to alarm and star-
tle and excite the members of this House ; and
if there was excitement here on that occasion,
was there any great cause of complaint or cen-
sure from any quarter? Was it not an exer-
cise of authority on the part of the Senate
over the House? I know there are many
members of the House who, when they find
their opinions are disagreed to by the Senate,
become very weak and docile and ready to be
instructed and directed by the Senate.
[Here the hammer fell.]

Mr. ASIILEY, of Ohio. I ask unanimous
consent the House to have printed some
amendments which I have prepared and pro-
pose to offer to the amendment of the Senate
to the joint resolution proposing a constitu-
tional amendment, recently passed by the
House. That subject will soon come before
the House, and I desire to have these amend-
ments printed. The first amendment I have
prepared is the one I prefer. If I cannot suc-
ceed in that, I then propose to offer the second
amendment in lieu of the sixteenth article of
amendment proposed by the Senate as prefer-
able to the one they propose.

print was accordingly made.

other officers.
In article two, section four, strike out the words
"Vice President."
Amend section one, article two, by striking out the
words "together with the Vice President chosen for
the same term;" so that it will read:

of the United States of America; he shall hold his
office during thÂ« term, of four years, and be elected
