HEADQUARTERS CENTER GRAND DIVISION,February 4, 1863-12 p. m.

Colonel J. K. KERR:

COLONEL: Colonel McIntosh reporting to me that his force of two regiments will only amount to 600 men, I think you had better add another regiment, say the First Massachusetts, as from the number of the enemy reported as being at the railroad crossing, and the facilities he possesses of crossing both above and below, I should fear 600 would be inadequate to the duty assigned to Colonel McIntosh.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CENTER GRAND DIVISION,February 4, 1863-Midnight.

General JOSEPH B. CARR,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Colonel McIntosh, who commands the cavalry reconnoitering party, says if you will give him three companies of the regiment assigned to you, he will take charge of the watching and guarding of Kelly's Ford, the one immediately below the railroad crossing. I desire this arrangement made, which will relieve your advance brigade from watching above Ellis' Ford.

Colonel McIntosh also says there is a strong cavalry reserve at Hartwood Church, which you are authorized to call on in case of necessity.

At Colonel Mcintosh's suggestion, the brigade you are instructed to post at Hartwood Church will be more efficient if sent down to the vicinity of the United States Ford, where it can meet and repel any attempt to cross on the part of the enemy. You will, therefore, please so post it.

Colonel McIntosh will see you at Hartwood to-morrow, and i desire you to co-operate with him in all matters.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-Genera.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Sent cavalry to Front Royal and Strasburg yesterday. No enemy there. Just received the most reliable information from the camp of the enemy. His effective force is only about 2,000 strong. Is mainly at Mount Jackson, engaged in conscripting; has no idea of attacking me. I can take him easily.
