of July 2, and also a report of the same regiments on July 4. A nominal and tabular report of casualties in the command has already been forwarded. * About dark on the evening of the 2d, the acting assistant adjutant-general of the First Brigade came to me and inquired for General Barnes; said he was directed by General Sykes to tell him to have the Second Brigade form on the right of the First in the position they then were. As General Barnes was not present, I received the order, and put the Second Brigade in the position indicated, where we remained until the evening of the 5th, when the division advanced toward Emmitsburg. In conclusion, I desire to express my gratification at the conduct of my staff during the engagement-Captain [George] Monteith, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain [Alvan C.] Lamson, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain [John S.] Burdett, acting commissary of subsistence, and Lieutenant [John A. M.] Seitz, acting aide-de-camp. They were prompt and fearless in the discharge of their duty. We were all fortunate enough to escape being hit, though a number of horses in the party were shot-two of the orderlies, the buglers, Lieutenant Seitzs, and my own.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. SWEITZER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Brigadier General CHARLES GRIFFIN, Comdg. Division.
