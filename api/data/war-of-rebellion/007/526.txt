Brigadier-General BUELL, Louisville:

General McClellan should not yet be disturbed with business. I think you better get in concert with General Halleck at once. I write you to night.* I also telegraph and write Halleck.

A. LINCOLN.

LOUISVILLE, KY., January 1, 1862.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President:

There is no arrangement between General Halleck, and myself. I have been informed by General McClellan that he would make suitable disposition for concerted action. There is nothing to prevent Bowling Green being re-enforced from Columbus if a military force is not brought to bear on the latter place.
