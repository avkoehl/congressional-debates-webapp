though I do not think t! em ngnt hi ¡hu se z ng 'he

equal merit with othets, s?ve m ihi—thy have,
heretofore, violated the laws oi thur "oun'ry, and
you now offer to Dnbt all the mhab tant of the
globe ¡o ,mi act' en. Bu' while I  i I do them
the amplest justice, I earmi t cor ent to h< here
and h ar it ••aid that ihey arc men < f more per*e-
verance, industry, enteri ns , virtu , and patriotism
than those whom they h^ve left behind them in th 
old States, cr that the negro of Africa, the Uzaroni
of Naples, and thp serf of Russia, have such me
nt<, and may be rewa ded at our expen e I am
not willing to heir these perpetual centrase be
tween the people of th- old and th  new S a fs It
is constantly rang in cur ears that pre-emmio-Frv
are men of great intelligence ara enterprise—quite
the guardian  of the country In leed' Whera
did they gel ttv^r mtell gence"' An 1 if o' more
virtue, where (ltd ihey acquire if 01 morede/r-
ttion to their country—on what thealre did they
learn mis extra ultra patriotism? That they un-
derstand the onnciples of civil Lberty be'ter—
where did ihey get ih° r knowledge' Who are
they? They are eitner loreisners, coming here
from lands of despotism, or tney a'e descendants
of th  men i f the Retolut'O" V they come from
abroad, why snail I admit úVir supe ¡only over
men born amidst ihe brings, and imbued trom
their crsdies with thp love, o civil liberty? I ad-
mit no "ucti thing But if the/ are the de^cerdan's
of the men of ihe Revolu ion, how came trey b/
such exclusive and pecular vii'n-1 No, wien I
admit their f quality wit - other , I aim t every thing
which can be ju tly denaiided. Above all, I am
not prepared to ackao >• edge that the e settlers,
either past or future, a e len of such pre eminent
excellence that I an bound to subnet to a wrong
perpetrated on m~ and rime n orler to ie<vard
them. I oo uot admire such contrasts. What
right have tne people ot Í ' nois over the people of
Delaware or New Jer ey v 1, ¡Ja aj' ior 7=s us to say

Govemirents, aie abi nd-"i'iy strong to -rotti t our

utterly po^erl ss >o pro oc' yours?"   It is demand-
ed of ns that we shall pa*s preemption laws as an
act of justice to the Dew States These States hold
large tree's of land, which are their own, will ¡heir
Senator- b* good enough to she w me the p'e-emr-
tions laws t , y have passed? Or do they think it
is well enovgh to urge ihis policy upon us, while
they repudia e it themselves? How much stronger
would their argument be, it they could say, "This
thing is rijiht m principle, and you see we practise
it in our own case?  But is it so? If a pre-emp^
lion law which is to affect my land is a good
thing, why would it not be as good if it affected
theirs?
I have ene more objection to u'ge. I feel strong
repugnance to that feature which calls men of all
natons tocóme and take a part of our public do-
main Tht mviution is too broad No matter
what clime a man may inhabit, no mat'er what
hue a Southern san may have burnt upon his fea-
tures, if he is in the form of man, he is invited
And it is now claimed for the Sta'es that they may
rrake him a ciuz n at what time and on what
terms they p'easc. I have not read m the history
of our Revolutionary struggle, in the Ameles of the
Confedera on, or m the Federal Constitution, any
thing which holds out to foreigners a bribe to come,
nor jist fies the States in making them our fellow-
citizens. a their pleasure These doctrines are
new, but ihev nt each oiher, and united, lead to
consequei cís which demand that we pause and
refl c . Why ho d oat such offers? Do we need an
army of foreigners to come amoi g Us because we'are
incapable oi managing our own offairs? or because
they srem n ot better political and moral princi-
ples' or thit they may protect us? I repeat here
what I a d as to pre emptioners. I will not be
arown int i the posuion < f one who is an opponent
of fore gneis None of the miserable slang ou
that subjec c n apply to any poition of my life.
The question here is not as to ihe terms on which
we «halt admit them, but as to the wisdom of thus
inviting them, and to the power lo admit them as
citizens las rot wh ther  hey shall pass through
a piobatiun oí five years or of ten years, or whe-
ther a sirnpl  oath oi allegiance alone shall place
them in the possession of the privileges and under
the obliga i >ns of ci'uen-hip But who has a right
to say wt-af the terms of admission shall be? You
invite th m to take your land <n Illinois, can Illi-
nois, as soon 's they get possession, saj they shall

Su e? A Swede, or an African, who was never a
slave in th s country or elsewhere, who has been
'reed, sccep'a}our invitation—'akes your offered
quar'er   c icn—can tn >t State make him a citizen
c f the Un on? Is this power of creating the citizsii

I'ce qu'-Miir) is not answered or affected by an
amen'mem which was offered lo that bill, that if
the ioreigi er declared under oath his m'ention to
make ihe land his heme, he might be a pre-emp-
t onei It r spectsnct its mere oath of intention or
allegiance I ris s higher Can the Slates make
a cu zen i the Union? It was not so when we
weiecjloies Then the power was m the British
Crown. The Parliament might say w ho should be
admitted lo citizenship in Englard, but even Par-
liament i elf could not declare that a Frenchman
should be a citizen of one of the British colonies
The Crov n was then the depository of that power.
