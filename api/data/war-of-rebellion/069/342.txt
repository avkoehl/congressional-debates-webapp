[Indorsement.]

Burnside has been directed to furnish Warren assistance. He has two divisions in reserve.

[G. G. M.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 4.45 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that you are too far to the left of General Burnside, who will have too great a space to occupy and have a strong reserve force. Send a staff officer to him to indicate where your right is, and one to show where you wish the supporting force brought to. General Burnside is ordered by the major-general commanding to send what troops of his not in line to support you at once, and to attack the enemy. Two of his divisions are south of the Totopotomoy; one north of it. He will be able to send you a division for support.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 30, 1864 - 5.20 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have already made just such arrangements, or nearly so, as your dispatch of 4.45 directs. I have sent Major Roebling to get the nearest division of General Burnside to take Griffin's place and let him move toward my center. If this can be done before dark we will attack. From the reports I receive I should think the enemy designed attacking me.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 5.40 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Your dispatch received. Two brigades of Burnside were sent to you at 5.20. He is ordered to send you all his surplus force. From the position of the army Burnside is probably the only source from which you can be readily re-enforced. If you think the enemy is in sufficient force to attack you, the commanding general thinks it would be better to receive his attack rather than attack him.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 30, 1864 - 6 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy brought up a battery to the neighborhood of Bethesda Church and opened. I doubt if any of General Burnside's troops will be here in time to do anything this evening. I think I can hold my own, if not attacked in very great force.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
