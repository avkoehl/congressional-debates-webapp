CITY POINT, VA., March 27, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

The Chronicle of yesterday gives my dispatches differently from what they were written. I had no estimate of our losses in the Ninth Corps, and placed our loss there about 800, probably less. The enemy's loss in front of that corps I estimated at 3,000 all told, killed, wounded, and captured. I was not aware at the time the published dispatches were written that the Sixth Corps had accomplished anything or lost anything. Subsequent dispatches, which will probably be published in to-day's papers, give the lates information corrected, so far as I know it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
