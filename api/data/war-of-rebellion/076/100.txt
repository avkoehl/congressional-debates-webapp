SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 9, 1864-10 a.m.

Brigadier General K. GARRARD,

Roswell:

Dispatch received. One division of Thomas' moved for Roswell last night by the river road. Two divisions of McPherson, Dodge's corps, are now moving for Roswell via Marietta. Hold fast all you have made, and fortify until re-enforced.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

JULY 9, 1864-10a.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: At 7 o'clock I sent you word that I was over the river and had the ridge. I have now a good position, and hold the Roswell and Atlanta road, which passes over the bridge. The ford is a little rough, but not deep. All is quiet in my front; but the regiment I sent to take the bridge, eight miles above, failed, and find some considerable force there. They can keep the enemy from burning the bridge, but cannot get possession of it. Prisoners report Kelly's division, Wheeler's corps, near that bridge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 9, 1864.

General GARRARD,

Roswell:

I have your second dispatch. Dodge was here en route for Roswell, and will come to you to-morrow; but in the mean time a division of Thomas' should be near there now. When Dodge comes up see him and consult as to the necessity of taking the upper bridge, or forcing the enemy to destroy it. Dodge will rebuild the bridge at the Factory. All well here. The enemy has moved troops to the other side, northward, but toward Schofield, I think.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ROSWELL, July 9, 1864-9 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have to report the arrival of General Newton with his division, Fourth Corps. All was quiet, and he relieved me about dark. My cavalry pickets are about two miles from the river, on the Atlanta road. There has been but slight opposition to-day, though my cavalry pickets stand opposite to those of the enemy, and have had some skirmishes. No sign of large force of the enemy's infantry. The ford is very rough and about belly deep. Wagons might be passed over, though it would be better to have the bridge built. Dimensions of old bridge: Length, 642 feet; 6 spans; good stone piers 14 feet from water.

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry.
