The Tariff—Mr. Ritchie.
Ho. OF Pi EPS,
conditions, and are substantially as different I
from each other as wood is from them both, '
and are 110 mora to be confounded iu economic j
relations. Besides, anthracite coal, in connec- j
tion with which tlie oppressive strikes and !
combinations have taken place, i.s free of duty '
now. It is bituminous only on which there is ;
a tariff. _ . . |
in view of these facts, the graphic pictures ,
of suffering among the poor of the eastern ■
cities, cau-cd by the high price of e«>al, fur- !
nish uo pretext lor the cry lor free coal as ;
against bituminous, because the coal v.hich
they used, and for which they were obliged to
pay famine prices, was the anthracite, which
is already free from tariff. It is the trick of
the demagogue or an unscrupulous enemy to
seek to laden one industry with the offenses
of another; and as there is now no duty upon
anthracite, it is a perverse and baleful logic
that would inflict a penalty for wrongs perpe-
trated in its behalf on another interest, not
only unoffending, but which has. so far as its
nat'uie would admit, by not sympathizing in
price, and thus taking advantage of the needs
of the people, mitigated the haidships inflicted
through the extortions of the otln-r.
While the policy continues, dating from the
foundation of the Government, of raising the
public revenue chiefly by taiiff duties, theie
aie strong considerations why bituminous coal
should be made dutiable. The revenue it afford-
ed last vear was S-538.000 : uo inconsiderable
sum. in view of the pressing needs ot the Gov-
ernment, and remembering that if coal tie
made free this amount must be made up from
an iticieased duty 011 other articles or a higher
rate oi internal taxation. It is abo a fact
entitled to great weight that if has been the
practice ot the Government for half a century,
and through all Administrations, to lay a duty
011 bituminous coal. The precedent thus set
was founded in wisdom. While England has
a coal-bearmg territory of about eight thou-
sand five hundred square miles, the coal-bear-
ing atea of the United States covers about
six hundred thousand square miles. Willi all
this latent wealth, and the capabilities it in-
volves in an age of steam to a nation compet-
ing with the leading Powers of the world ia
- the fieids of manufactures and commerce, and
looking to its means of attack and defense in
case of war, our statesmen were not sloif to
discern that our interest lay in the fullest devel-
opment, of our coal industry. As illustrative
of this, the history of the tariff shows that
while the dut) is now SI 2o per ton, during
the administrations of John Quincv Adams.
Andrew Jackson, and Martin \ uu Buien a
duty of $1 08 per ton was uniformly main-
tained ; and during every subsequent Adminis-
tration there has been, while somewhat vary-
ing, always a considerable duty.
Not only was the foundation of tins policy
a sound one. but, because such has been the
policy for so long a period, it should not be
lightly reversed. It is of the fir-t importance
to industrial enterprises that there should be
steadiness and consistency in the adjustment
of tiuilf dunes to articles of home production,
and especially so in the case ot an article
requiring so much capital for its working as
bituminous coal. Good faith requires that the
Government should not hastily inflict disaster
upon those who have invested heavily in the
development of this interest on the strength
of an established policy of fifty jcars. Lpon
the faith of this fiiendiy policy the State of
Maryland, which 1 have the honor in part to
repiesent, has ventured largely. The c°al"
fields of Alleghany by the fostering hand of
the Government were held up to excite her
enterprise and invite her investment, and, in
consequence, of public and private capital, in
the purchase and working of the mines, and
associated and dependent interests, and iu the
building of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal,
the Baltimore and Ohio, Western Maryland,
and other existing and projected railroads,
which would scarcely have been undertaken
apart from the anticipated profits, direct
and indirect, of the coal traffic, she has now
employed, I suppose, at least $60,000,000.
Sir, my State being thus interested, so long
as New England presses for protection 011
manufactures, the West for piotection on
wool, and Michigan and Wisconsin for pro-
tection on lumber, I would be justified, on the
principle merely of fair play, in objecting to
; their united clamor for free coal, but I have,
, looking to the past and the intrinsic value of
' coal to the enterprises of all sections, the
I broader justification of established national
] policy and the national welfare.
| Since the British province of Nova Scotia
1 is virtually the only source of importation with
■ which our bituminous coal production is ,
! brought into competition, the proposal to ;
' repeal or reduce the duty is, in effect, a prop- ;
osition to increase the advantages of our for-
: eign rival. Under the reciprocity treaty,which
; went iuto effect J une. li>34, and expired March,
j 1860, coal was admitted free of duty from the
British possessions. On its termination the
■ present duty of §1 2-3 per ton was enacted.
' We have theiefore, in the operation of the
! reciprocity treaty, and in the effect of the duty
since imposed, reliable data from which to
determine how the quantity of home produc-
! tion, tiie supply generally, and the pnee to
I consumers has been, and is likely to be,
affected by the absence or existence ot the
! duty, and the wisdom of the policy that would
paralyze or cripple this valuable home indus-
try, and place us for our great motive power
in peace and war at the mercy of our " an-
cient enemy."
The quantity of coal raised and shipped ia
the province of Nova Scotia, according to i
J. Rutherford, Chief Inspector of Mines, has
been as follows :

i This table discloses that as much coal has
I been annually imported from Nftva Scotia
j since the duty of $1 25 per ton was imposed,
; on the termination of the treaty, as when,
' during its existence, there was no duty at all,
, evidencing, what, is also well known otherwise,
! that the cost of producing and bringing provin-
' cial coal to our eastern markets is so much
less than that attending our own that the duty
paid b\ the former does not materially affect
its profits.
I here furnish a statement exhibiting the
; number of tons of American bituauuous coal

It will be perceived that from the year 1854
to 1805, the eleven years of the duration of
the treaty, when coul vv&s adinitted free, the
yearly American production increased from
tio'J,081 tons to but. 1,969,247 tons, while dur-
ing only the six succeeding years, from 18oo
to°1872, the duty being $1 25 per ton, the
increase has been from 1.98y,247 to 4.641,722
tons; that is, iu the eleven years, when bee,
1,329,506; in the six years, with the duty,
2,052,475 tons. The statu^t-ics as to the pro-
portion furnished fiont Alleghany county, in
my State, are,-it will be observed: ^

showing, at. to our Mar^la.id production, all
increase in the eleven jearrf of the treaty of
but 24U.814 tons, and in the sis years since
of 1,441,688 tons!
j The increased facilities of transportation
! have doubtless had much to do with the  ag-
1 mentation of the production in Pennsylvania;
' but it must be remembered there would be
■ uo inducement to supply the means of trans-
portation for coal unless it were profitable to
mine it. The one flows from the other. ?
i additional facilities for transportation,-, and
i the lucrative employment, to capital arid labor
I involved in works of iaipi-'ovement)
! are beneficial results of the imposition of the
: duty, which, while indirect, are as much So be
j reckoned iu summing up its advantages, and
! to be taken into as tender consideration, as
'■ the coal interest proper.
The next inquiry, and a very material one,
. is, how has the price of the article been
■affected? Has the tariff duty been added to
i it? If not, but, on the contrary, the increased
I production caused by its imposition has ia
