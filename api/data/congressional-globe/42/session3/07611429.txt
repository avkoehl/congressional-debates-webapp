That the chief signal officer may cause to be sold
anysurplus maps or publications of the Signal Office,
the money received therefor to be applied to the

Mr. RANDALL. I hope that will not be
done.

these little weather maps he sends out to go
free of postage. I will explain the whole mat-
ter if you will let it be in Order.

Mr. BURCHARD. The last part of that

franking privilege again, and I must object
to it.

officers of the Government the privilege of
franking.
Mr. DAWES. I will state what he wants:
these little weather reports are now sent free
from every weather station to every post office
within one hundred miles. He would like to
have them go free hereafter, as they do now.
Mr. RANDALL. We have abolished the
franking privilege, and it is not right to give
it to one officer and not to all.
Mr. DAWES. I will withdraw the latter
part of the amendment.

as modified was ordered to be in order in the
