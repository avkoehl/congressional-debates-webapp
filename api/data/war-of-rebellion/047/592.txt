CHARLESTON, S. C., December 29, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

I keep the Adjutant-General habitually advised of all important operations and measures for defense in this department. I inclosed, November 29, papers showing precisely what I proposed to do it compelled by superior numbers to yield line of Savannah Railroad. It is proper to say my plans are always based on concentration, not dispersion, of forces at my command. However, since November 29, progress of works on James Island has enabled me to detach over two regiments to Third District. (See also Special Orders, Nos.257 and 263, these headquarters,* on fire with Adjutant-General.)

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 29, 1863.

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN,

Lake City, Fla.:

Do not move any infantry form their stations. General commanding will try to do without disturbing your troops.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 29, 1863.

Brigadier General HENRY A. WISE,

Adams Run, S. C.:

Movements in force of enemy appear to look to anticipation of our effort to recover guns. Therefore the attempt must not e made without strong apparent chances of success, and without too great sacrifice of our men.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 29,1 863.

Brigadier General HENRY A. WISE,

Adams Run, S. C.:

It is not considered advisable to attack Legareville at present. Limit expedition to recovery of lost howitzers and tools. Movement must be concealed from enemy's lookouts, if practicable.

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 29, 1863.

Movements of enemy in force appear to look to anticipation of our efforts to recover guns. Therefore attempt must not be made without strong apparent chances of success, and without too great sacrifice of life.
