Corps commanders will ascertain what force is sufficient for holding securely their positions and what number of troops will then remain free for use in offensive movement or in extending the front of available force for these purposes, and the commanding general desires that corps commanders will examine their positions carefully necessary to reduce the number of men holding them to the lowest number possible. Major-General Burnside has approached to within a quarter of a mile of Spotsylvania Court-House with trifling opposition. Corps commanders will report what changes, if any, have taken place in their front and will keep their skirmishers well pressed against the enemy.

SPECIAL ORDERS.] HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 11, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Two days' rations will at once be issued to the troops (one of them to include the day's salt meat now in the wagons), also 50 rounds of ammunition per man. All empty wagons will be sent with as little delay as practicable to Belle Plain, there to be loaded with their maximum capacity with supplies for the army. The chiefs of staff departments will immediately make the necessary arrangements to draw from Belle Plain such supplies for their respective departments as the wagons placed at their disposal will allow, and they will make their requisitions on the officer of the quartermaster's department at Belle Plain for transportation.

Three days' salt meat will be included among the stores to be provided by the subsistence department, and an officer of that department will be detached from each corps to procure supplies for his department. The chief quartermaster of this army is charged with the general direction of the transportation of supplies from Belle Plain to the army. The trains are to be escorted from Alrich's to Belle Plain by Ferrero's division, and the cavalry of the Ninth Corps from Belle Plain to the army. The escort will be made up of reenforcements expected.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
