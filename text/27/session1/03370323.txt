in whichl stand (said Mr M ) towards thp majority on this
floor, and towatds a laige and ¡espectable portion of ray Iriends
at home, who are adverse to the course I have puisued, made
me desirous of expiessmsr my views on these great and impor
tant questions It was m vain, however, that I have repeated
]y attempted to ob am the floor, and, in consequence of the ar
bitrary rules fastened on us by you, Mi speaker, and yout as
sociales I have been compelled to vote on measures deeply
affecting the inteiest of my constituents, without the privilege
of utleunga woid in explanation of my viewsoi m justifica

[Several members here rose, and objected to M's pro
ceeding ]

The Sl'EAKbR called Mi  M to ordei
Mi M Well, bii, if Í cannot now proceed, I will, on the
firs occasion, denounce the tyianny and opptession of this
House I will le&ibt it to the last, let the consequences be

have only to say that I wiil object to any motion, petition, or

Mr   BARNARD  movelthitthe House íesolve itself into
Committee oi the Whole on the btate of the Union
On which motion no quorum voted
Mr BRIGO moved a call of the House
Mi WELLER asked the yeas and navs, which were ordered,
and being taken were—yeas 52, nays 73
So the call was refused
And the questio i lecurnng on the motion of Mi Barnard
that the Hou&e resolve itself into Committee of the Whole on
the State of the Union—
The motion was waived for a moment to enable
The SPEAKER, to laybeloiethe House a communication
from the Pobt master <>enerai, in i elation to the amount of mo
neys appropriated at the last session of Congress foi the new
Post Office building
The communication was lai 1 on the table and ordered to be
printed
Mr HOPKINS moved that the communication of the Post
master General be 1 d on the table, and punted Mr H said
that he had but a woid to «ay at present in i elation to
•his communication. The Postmaster General says that the
appropriation foi the new Po&t Office budding foi the pie&ent
year was$100,000 only, and not 8125 000, as stated in the reso
Jution adopted by the House calling on him for the unexpended
balance This might be tiue, but if it was, Doc No 41, being
a message from the President tiansmittmg a communication
from the Postmastei General, asking for a fuither appropna-
tion for completing th<* building ind enclosures, of $100 000,
was false, for it appeared from that document, which he now
had before him, that the appiopuation for 1S41 was $125,000
Both communications came fiom the Postmaster General, and
it was no business oí Ins to reconcile the discrepancy between
them
The SPEAKER also laid before the House certain deposi
tions in the case of the contested election tromtne State of Vir
gima, which were referí ed to the Committee of Elections
rORTIFirCAIlON BILL

Ways and Means, leported back to the House the bill making

The bill and amendments, on motion of Mr F were refened
to the Committee of the W hole on the state of the Union
And, on motion of Mi HOWARD of Michigan, the amend

ordered to be printed
BANKRUPT LAW
On motion of Mi BERNARD, the House resolved ift-elf into
Committee of the Whole on the stite oí the Union, (Mr Til
LiNGHASTof Rhode I&lanl in the chair, on the bill Horn the&e
nateio estabh&h a umfoun system of banUuptcy throughout
the United States
The pending question being the monon submitted by Mr
Gordon of New \oik to stride out the enacting clause of the
bit!—
Mi FES&ENDEN (who was entitled to the flooi) addiessed
the committee, duilng the hour, uigently in ía\ oí oí the passage
of the bill
He insisted on the power and the obligation of Congress to
maintain such a law in operation at all time*, and on the espe
cial obligation resting on Gongiess to exeiuse us power at the
present time for narticulai reaso is—smee,, had it not jibe* n foi
the action of the Gctieial Government upon the cuirency, the
country would not now have been labonug under the embar
íassmenls and difficulties which pervaded cvciy ¡section oJ it
He expieseed himself o\ posed to all amendments that might
be offered to the bill, and especially so to an amendment wh ch
had been indicated, mcludingbankmg coiporatiuin    He was
understood to declare himself in favoi of such t principle at
the propel time and in thepiopei place, but to contend that
the two systems ought not tobe combined, that there must be
a separate system   foi   individuals, and a sépante system foi
corporations, in order to enable them to work well and m hai
mony    fie believed that such an amendment, if now intro
duced  into this bill,   would be  fatal to us parage      We
knew,   from   what   had   already   taken place at the  other
end  of the   Capitol,   that it  could  not   succeed,   and   he
should suspect the moti\e of its mtioduction here to be a
desue or design to defeat the bill itself     This bill hil been
well  considned and wtil digested, it had been long  undei
the consideiation of the ablest minds oí the country     We
must (as had been remarked) set the ship all sat   we must
launch it in the tir t place   u waa idle to suppose that a mea
sure so comprehensive, and co\eimgso much giound as this,
could be made perfect at once    Nothing but expenence, no
thing but a knowledge oí us piactical operation, could enable
us to make it such as would meet every case, to free U from
every difficulty, and to put it in such ashape as to meet every
objection tint might be raided against it It would be better
to carry the bill through as it came from the Senate, because
he believed that, at this late period of the session, H an attempt
was made to amend it, when theie were so many exciting
questions before them, Congress would use without doing any
thing on this subject to answer the expectations of the people
of the United States
This was emphatically a measure of relief, it was for the
pui poses of relief that this Congiess had teen convened They
had called themselves the relief Congress He trusted that no
gentleman on either side would deny that the people of this
countiy had long been m a state in which they needed relief oi
some kind, and relief from legislation If such was the iact,
was it not manifest that no measure oí the piesentses ion pro
misedsuih direct and immediate relief as this? The other mea
suies of the session—the Bank bill (which some gentlemen be
lieved to be the soveieign panacea foi all oui ills)—would take
time before they could aiFord relief, but this bill would go into
immediate operation
Mr F after glancing bupfly at the history of tins subject in
the United state, proceeded to argue at length the power of
Gongiess ovei it, contending that tne Constitution of the United
States had conferied upon them the broadest, the most liberal,
and the most comprehensive powei in relation to it Tiom this
pomtMr F passed on *o some geneial remaikson the piovi
sions of the bill, and concluded by uiging its passage on the
ground of the benefits which it would conier on the i leditois
as well as on the debtois; as a measure called foi alike by the
feelings of humanity and by the great interests of the com
m unity
Mr LINN of New York said he did not use to address the
committee at large oi upon the merits of the bill He left the
discussion ol the punuple involved m themeasuie toothers
He had, for himself, and not without some deliberation and the
solution of many doubts, concluded to give the measuiehiscor
dial support He had looked at thf quemón m its relations to
the g^mus of the Government thechaiacter of the people and
the exigencies ol the times He desired, at this time, to call the
attention of the committee to comcof the details of the bili, in
tending, at the proper time, to offer Mime amendments coire
sponding with the views he entertained He could not consent
to launch the ship if Ik might bt- \ enniUed to use the figure
of his colleague, [Mi Babnapd ] until I e was quite sure she
was sea worthy, and would not &mk on her fhst voyage Nor
could he adopt the pi mciplem legislation assumed bv the g n
tleman who had just preceded him [Mi Fes&enden j by which
he was to follow in the wake of some great mind, no matter
where it conducted us He could not consent thus to stultify
himself, or to shuthis eyes to defects m the details of the bill
I here were defe< ts in the bill, affecting thp interests of both
debtor and ci editor, and some of which, he feared, would render
the measme quite obnoxious to the ve y cías  ol peisoiis for
wi ose bt nefit it was pioposed Although he would not say that
a failure to amend would cause him to vote against the bill, he
denned, as a sincere friend of the measure, to perfect it, and
would, theiefore, call the attention of the committee tosuch de
fects a  ¡seemed to him worthy oí attention
Mr jUinn then specified a variety of amendments, and modi
hcatons which he illustrated and urged at large Oí these, the
most ímpoitan íelated to the piovisions made for debts
owing in a fiduciary capacity, the provisions as to which he
insisted weie ambiguous, and conflicted with each other, the
provision made foi proof of frauds in oidei to invalidate the
discharge, which he deemed insufficient, and to remedy which
he proposed an additional section, the provision made foi the
collection of the debts of the bankrupt by the assignees which
Mi L thought shut outthepmsdictionof the State coutts, and
thus much increased the expenses attending the settlement of
estates
Mi L aftei illustrating these provisions, concluded by ex-
pie&smg the hope that, as theie was sufficient time for dehbe
rate legislation, it would not be denied
Mr PENDLETON rose m reply He declined going at
large into a discu&non of th< meiitsof the bill, because all he
had intended to say had aheady been better sailbyotheis
The bill was not perfect, not wis itieasonable to expect that,
m framing-an un iitd mea^uie of *ogieat difficulty as tins, per
fection should bt, attained The gentleman had compared it to
a ship about to be launched Mr P said it was no sufficient
objection to committing her to the bosom of the deep, that
every spat might not have the requeue decree of Upei, or that
every rope might not run with perfect ueedom through the
block il it was certain that the vessel would float, that ¡she
had the requisite amount of ballast, that hei eaigo would be
s ife <md the lives of her ciew, let her be given to hei destined
clement, and sent upon hei voyage These mmoi mattcis
misht be íeclified after she had made a tup and tued her bedi
ings, and been found &e iwonhy If gentlemen were to wait
till an imtned mearme wa& íendeied peiitct in then imaeina
tion before it was subjected to any expeiment, an original law
n ver could be enacted Eveiy gentleman must, to a certain
extent, defei to the opinión-^ ol othei gentlemen iiound him,
else theie would be no legislation Why entei into debate it
opinions were not to be compaied* and why co nj die opi
ni >m if each man was detei mined obstinately to adhere to hi«i
ownl
The gentleman who ha,l preceded him had f ut the question
whethei amcmbei ought to vote for a measme to which lie
ieltvery suong and weighty ob e uon^ The gentleman had
taken the negative, Mi P uibi&ted on the affirmative The
gieat obiect was to secure the principle embodied in the mea
sine if a man appioved, and could, by his vote secure thi&,
let the details be disponed ol as well as they could, and as time
and subsequent experience might point out Mr P was
¿verse to mere tbbti ict theories If he wanted to provide i
men anule bill, he wa-, for consulting intelligent meichant  if
he wasfoi making a law to regulate mechanical opeiations, he
would go and inquue at Lowell So, in i elation to thia biM it
was eminently a practical matter, and not to be decided upon
on mere abstract reasonings
Mi P now prxeedtd to notne the objection-, viiin.li had
been Mired by Mt Linn, to answer winch wis the sole pur
pose for whichhehad iibtn
Heundeistood Mr L a& objtctin* to the piovisions oi the
bill because defaulters and all otheis v*ho had conducted frau
dulently asdehtois under a trust were not included m its be
Mi   LINN explained and stated more pailicularly the ob*
l actions he had uigedwhcu up
Mr PENDLETON considered this provision of the bill as &
lecommendation rather than as an tbjection to it, its tendency
was to make men honest If it could be proved that m any
tiansattion they hid acted iiaudulently,they ought tobe de-
pnvedofall benUU horn this bill The gentleman had also
made some ob|ection to a want of clear provision as to notice
to be given to the debtor of an intention to impeach his certifi-
cate, but these matters of detail could all be regulated by the
rules to be piovided by the courts.
In reply to the objection that the bill compelled the assignee
of the debtoi to collect his debts in the district courts, Mr P.
denied that such was the result of its provisions It did indeed
give the district c >uitsjunsdiction, but itleft untouched the |u
nsdiction which the State courts had under their respective
State Constitutions
Mr P proceeded to notice the other objections of Mi. Likk
in older, and during his speech, making and receiving sundiy
explanations fiom Mr BARNUiD,Mr Íriplett, Mr Warren,
Mi Trumbull, and othei gentlemen, as to law points involved
lie concluded by expiessmg an earnest hope for the passage of
the bill
Mi. IIlUMBULLsaid theie were some objectionable provi
sions in the bill, tj which he should have called the nonce of
the committee, if this had not already been done by other gen
tlemen lie thought it ought to contain such apiovi&ioitas> was
contained m< he act of 1800, giving the ci editors of a bankrupt
a voice in the appointment of his assignee
One amendment had been proposed by the gentleman from.
New "York, [Mr Roosevelt,] which he should more particu-
larly notice It was that which went to include in the scope of
the bill State corporations, and especially banks To this  he
objected, fiist because it was "ow too late to urge it, the ¡states
hail been for half acentury in the habit of chartering these cu
porations li it were now an original question whethei we
bhould have their paper as a currency, there might be mor
loom for doubt, but it was too late in the day The State6
suiely were most competent to judge whethei banks wei
nr weie not mjunous to their respective communities, an
if the States could create banks, they had also the powe"
to supervise and preserve them But if Congre&s, thiough thr
intervention of a bankrupt law, had it in its power toputae
end to banking corpoiauons just as fast as the State coula
create them, the power to incorporate was nugatory Thfl
power to declare banks bankrupt had never been claimed by©
the General Government until since the recent suspension o
specie payments Todo so by the intervention of Congress
would he something entirely novel, although the States had
claimed and exercised ihe power from the very date of the
Constitution The indulgence to banks, as to continuing
suspensions, which had been so much complained of and de
nounced, wa^ not so much an indulgence 10 the banks them-
selves as to the communities m which they were situated
The banks of Mr T 's portion of the country had been able to
lesumeandto cuutmue specie payments, but it was at ihe
solicitation of Government that they remained in a state of
suspension It was within Mr T's personal knowledge that
they had said toa committee of the Legislature, "if you ad
vise ustoie^ume, we will do it before night" The indul
gence was not to the banks, it was to the community around
them Let the blame, then, if any, fall where it was merited
Many talked of the banks as the authors of all our difficul-
ties nnd emharrissments, but Mr T thought it an unjust im-
putation Were the banks the authors of traáe? or was
trade the author of the banks? They were the mere mstru
ments of thetiade of a business community, to the spirit of
nade they owed their cieation, and whoevei denounced them
vnmatly attacked the spnit of trade and commerce which so
eminently dietingui ed our countrymen The banks weie
contiollerl by the citiaens, their excesses were owing not to
the will and choice of the corp nations themselves, but to the
Mate of the country, its wide extent, its remote position in re-
lation to the old tiaosatlantic world, the vast multitude and
vaiiety of objects of speculation and enterprise with which it
every whete abounded It was a voung country, and as such,
subject to all the stimulants which addressed themselves to
youthful feelings Its fiee institutions, both civil and reli
gious, were its great glory It abolished al governmental es-
tablishment or patronage oi any religious sect, no lestrictioa
was imposed upon conscience, but all men "were left, m mat
ters of faith and of religious observance, free as the air they
breathed Look at out common schools, the great sources of
education, look at the fact that all, oi nearly all, our popula
tion weie able to read and wiite, and to conduct the ordinary
tian^attionsof business, look at the consequent prevalence of
knowledge, the developement of ingenuity which filled oui
land with lahoi saving machinery, look at the abolition of
ptimogeniuri and entails, look at thecaae with which pro
peity might be icquued, sum upail these things, exisung si
mukaneousiy in one vast, free, wide tpiead community, and
need any one be astonished that banks should run into extra
vagance m discount*, an i circulation? Toiemedy these ex
cesses, did gentlemen wish to prostrate all the banfes in the
country?
None but natural persons had ever been contemplated m
the provisions ot the Constituían empowering Congress to
pa«s a general bankmpt law, because at the time theie were
none othei The bankiuptlaw of England, so far from m
eluding corpoiauons, expressly excluded them? and this was the
only law m force at the adoption of the Constitution (Mi T
hei e quoted thehw ) The including bank corporations m ho
piovisions of a general bankrupt law was a measure new foi
the filial time rropoaed I heie existed at that time many cor
porations in oui country, such i^ schoolb, academies, and col-
le^e^ Did any man m his senses believe the Constitution can
templatedthat these institutions weie to be requued to make
discov cry ol their assets and suffer an assignment*
None of the n otivca which applied to a law for bankrupt in
dividuals, ma uadmg community, applied to the case of cor
porations     One great motive in the case of debtors was a feel
m<* of humanity and compassion toward them    Butdid the e
feelings íespect a mere ideal peison, the creature of law E   The
