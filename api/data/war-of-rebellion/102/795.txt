General DODGE,Fort Leavenworth:

General Sully dispatches from Sioux City, under date of June 2, that it is the Cheyennes who are in the Black Hills, and they want to fight. I send you up to-day 900 horses for Michigan Brigade; will send others as fast as I can get them.

JOHN. POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, June 6, 1865-3. 48 p. m.

General DODGE,Fort Leavenworth:

My opinion is that whilst you had a perfect right to eject intruders on Indian reservations and arrest them if they persisted in returning, it was equally binding upon you to turn them over to the U. S. district court for trial as soon as possible after they were arrested. I think the laws of Congress on this subject plain. I sent your dispatch, however, to Washington and requested an answer to-day. I may possibly not receive one in time for you. If not, your had best act as I suggest. You cannot be held accountable for the arrest.

JOHN. POPE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, June 6, 1865.

(Received 1. 30 p. m. 7th.)

Major General JOHN POPE:

Have you seen order mustering out dismounted cavalry? I perhaps have cavalry enough for present use, but I do not consider it prudent to be without a force that I can use in any emergency or call this is made on me. If they were sent forward in a week or two it might do. I think, however, you should have another brigade here.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., June 6, 1865.

(Received 1. 30 p. m. 7th.)

Major General JOHN POPE:

On reading General Grant's dispatch again my answer may be misinterpreted. If General Grant means more cavalry besides the two brigades he speaks of as being under orders, in addition to what has arrived there, I should say we do not need any more. In speaking of sending another brigade, I meant in addition to the Michigan Brigade and the Second Ohio and Eighth Illinois.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
