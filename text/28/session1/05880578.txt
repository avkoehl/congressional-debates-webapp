APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBfc.
^8th Cong 1st Sess.
Appropriation Bill—Mr. Houston.
June, 1844.
H. of Reps.
seems he has given the expenses under three head-
ings, "Expenditures " "Aggregate Expenditures"
and " Total Expenditures" embracing different
amounts ; and lor the life of me, I cannot make the
distinction, which he seems to see, between .the
"expenditures" excluding nothing/ the "aggre-
gate expenditures and the " total expenditures
each one means the entire amount, unless there be
some restriction in express terms. Then, sir, I leave
the gentleman his tables and statements, contradic-
tory as they are in my view, with the hope, that,
upon a re-examination, he will explain, or correct, so
as to do Mr. Van Buren's administration justice.
One more table, and I will let the gentleman off.

I have compared the amounts which he charges
for the years 1838, 1839, 1840, and 1841, with the
amounts given by Mr. Spencer, Secretary of the
Treasury, for the same years, communicated iu his
report to Congress, 11th December, 1843, and which,
the Secretary says, are made up from the warrants
of each year, (certainly the most correct way to ar-
rive at the true amounts.) For the three years of
Mr. Van Buren's administration, he has charged
over the Secretary of the Treasury; for 1841, (the
first year of his own administration,) he falls under the
Secretary more than half a million of dollars. Now,
sir, I know there are accidents and errors to which
we are all liable; yet my honorable friend has been
somewhat unfortunate in making them against us,
and for his own side, I have no idea there wa« de-#
sign in this; X know the gentleman's fair, manly
course forbid that. I must be permitted, however,
to say to him, in the best feeling of friendship, that,
although he may speak guess well, he certainly
is not very "good at cyphering."
But, sir, our opponents induced the people to believe
that if they should obtain the control of the govern-
ment, a reduction in the expendituies would be made
not merely to $20,000,000, but to about $13,000,000.
This was charged upon them in the Senate, at the
last Congress, which Mr. Clay then very promptly
denied. That I may do him no injustice, I will give
his denial and his promise, in parallel columns, and
leave the country to judge of the accuracy of his
statements. Here X ask leave to read them:
In his Hanover speech, de-
livered June 27,1840, Mr. Clay
The annual expenditures
may, in a reasonable lime, be
brought down fiom Hs present
amountof almost foi ly millions
to near one third of that sum."
—Giles's National Register,
page 825,
" Mr. Clay said he would cor-
rect an asseition, that thewhij
party, when out oi power, as
serted, that if trusted with the
helm, they would administer
this government at an amount
of expenditure not exceeding
$13,000,000 " * " "I know
of no such position ever taken
by the whig party, or by any
prominent member of ih.eioh.ig
party. Sure 1 am that the party
generally pledged itself to no
such l eduction of the publicex
penses. None. * * * * )
deny (in no offensive sense) thai
the whig party ever promised to
reduce the expendituies of thu '
government to $13,000,000." *
"I hope, now, 1 have shown
(hat the whig party, before they
obtained power, never weie
pledged to bring down the pub
lie expenses, either to thirteen
or to fifteen millions "—Match
1,1842, 2d sess. 27 th Congress.
App 193.
Alter reading the extract from his Hanover speech,
who can doubt that he made the promise, or held out
the inducement to that belief, and that he so intend-
ed it, notwithstanding his denial. Then, sir, have they
reduced the expenditures] They have not only
failed to reduce, but their first year was millions over
the last year of Mr. Van Buren, as shown by them-
selves.
But this is not the only shuffling, of which Mr.
Clay has been guilty, in regard to the expenditures.
In 1836, before the whigs were in power, he charged
a "wasteful expenditure " on the then administra-
tion, for the army, the navy, and for fortifications.
In 1842, after the whigs were in charge of the go-
vernment, his lune was changed ; then he said the
last administration had not expended as much on
these objects as should have been expended. But,
sir, let him speak for himself:
Mr. Clay said :
"He would advise that Sena-
tor, however, [Mr. Walker,J
and those who acted with htm,
if they wished to avoid an in
crease of ihe tariff to stop where
they were ; to make no more
extravagant appropi iations; to
pursue no longer the course
which they had adopted. Ten
millions for the navy, and fifteen
millions for the Wai Depart
merit' Did any one behevethai.
an augmentation o< the tariff been expended.
was not inevitable if (his waste
ful expenditure was counte^
nanced and sustained?" * * *
"Gentlemen, however, were
not satisfied with an appropna
tion of ten millions forthe navy;
they wanted the whole linn or
coast fortified, so that, as his
colleague had observed the
other day, gun for gun might be
heard from one extremity of the
coast to the other."— Gatesand
S^aton, vol 12,pai t "2d. pngr.s
1397-'S8; May 5, 1836. I
What are we to make of this ? Did he discover
that he was mistaken when he charged wasteful ex-
travagance on the democrats 7 that he and his'friends
were'compellcd to increase the expenses for those
items? If so, he should have had the manliness to
have admitted it, and done justice to those whom he
had injured.
I have another table, Mr. Chairman, which I will
exhibit for the benefit of my whig friends and the
country. It shows what thoy charged as the public
debt left by Mr. Van Buren's administration on the
4th of March, 1841, and presents as many phases
and contrad>ct}nns, hues, and absurdities, as the one
on the expenditures. \ou can find almost anv
amount you please in it, from about {5,000,000 to
$70,000,000 ; aad these amounts, as well as those in
the previous tables, I have taken, with great care and
accuracy, from the speeches themselves; and if I state
any one incorrectly, he may set me right My ob-
ject is to deal faiily with the subject, fairly with my
political opponents and fairly with my own con-
science. I will not, knowingly, do injustice to any
man ; and as my time is rapidly diminishing, I must
give the table and pass on, leaving you and the
country to examine it, and make the proper compa-
risons :

Many others could be added. But who does not
see the gross injustice which has. been done to the
last administration] I could here dilate, but prefer,
at present, to take an extract, expressive of my
views :
" Thomas Ewing, of Ohio, was placed in charge of the Trea-
sury Department, and no event was looked forward to with a
deeper interest than the expose he would make upon the meet-
ing of Congress, both to that body and to the countiy, of the
state of our finances generally, and especially of the condition
and amount of our great national debt.
"Mr. Secretary Ewing's repoi t 'on the state of the finances,'
came to Congress on the 3d of June, 1841, and in it was found
a page (see piges 7 and 8 of the repoii) under the imposing
head 4 of the public debt.' A careful perusal of this head of
the report, although the subjects of the existing revenue laws,
of new loans, of the burdens of increased taxation, of the cur-
rency, of the necessity of relief to the commerce and industry
of the country, of the time required for the payment of the
national debt, of the policy of contracting such a debt by the
issue of treasury notes and by more permanent loan?, and of
the advantages of a funded debt over one remaining in the form
ol treasury notes, are discussed, will not thow one word as to
the amount of ihe debt. This very important division of this
very important report, concludes with the following verj indefi-
nite sentence:
'•'It is therefore respectfully recommended, that a sum suffi-
cient to pay the debt at present existing, and such as will neces-
sarily accrue m this and the ensuing year, be raised on loan for
the time, and on the condition above suggepted.'

Mr. Chairman, the %1th Congress and its mea-
sures have been spoken of at this session by some
of the whigs as a "glorious Congressand my
friend from Kentucky [Mr. Davis] talked as if he
were prmul of the honor of having been one of the
whig members of it. Now, sir, that will present it-
self to every unprejudiced mind as being very extra-
ordinary. What, sir ! have gentlemen no shame for
past misconduct 1 Will they blindly, a d as if in a
fit of madness, approve that which has been con-
demned and repudiated by the American people,
with almost universal indignation 1 that which has
been " torn down and destroyed" by order of the
people themselves, as being unworthy of a place in
the statute book of an American Congress'! that
which has been repealed by the very Congress which
had the inglorious honor of its enactment? .9 clari-
ons Congress, sir! I had hoped there was yet fair-
ness and candor enough amongst the whig politicians
to have kept them from praising, at least, if wc could
not wring from them proper acknowledgments in
