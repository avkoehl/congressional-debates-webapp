THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb 7,
sent, Mr C  was sure he would correct.    It was,
that he was surprised to find the State stock ot |
Ohio selmg at 115, while mat of Pennsylvania
was at 100 or 102     Mr  C was himself surprised |
at the fact, as he supposed  it was  when  it was j
stated, but he thought it was correct    Upon the
assumption of its truth, the gentleman insinuated
that it was owing to a combination between the I
Bank of the United States and the brokers, with J
a view of producing effect upon the Pennsylvania |
Legislature, and thus reach Washington     Now,
what must be the surprise of the Senate, when he
told them tne truth of the fact    The truth is, the
stock of Pennsylvania selling at i02, was bearing
an interest of five per cent , while that of Onio
bore in interest of six per cent     Any one might
make a calculation showing that the five per cents
being less in the maiuet, the stock of Pennsyl-
vania was really the highest     Yet the member
threw out the insinuation against the bank on
these grounds     He thought the gentleman owed
it to himself, to his constituents, to justice and to
truth, to rectify the mistake, and to retract the
injustice he had done    Scarcely a day passed that
he did not hear of distress prevailing in Pennsyl-
vania.    It was only this morning he had received
a letter from Pittsburg on this subject, which he
begged leave to lead     [Mr   C   here  read  the
letter ]    This letter was from a man in Pittsburg,
than whom there was no one more respectable,
and few rnoie opulent
He oroposed the resolution with a view to a
sDecific inquiry, and he hoped that it would be
adopted                                                                          I
Mr KANE   The historian of Charles the Fifth
of Spam, among the achievements of that eventful
reign, has recorded the fact that that monaich
made the Pope of Rome his pnsonei, and whilst 1
Charle3 held down upon him the scievvsof angid I
captivity, and at a moment when a wink of his
eye or a shake of his finger would have given fiee- ,
dom to his captive, he coolly turned around, and
dnee'ed all the piiests of his extensive dominions I
to offei up their piayers to Heaven foi thespeedy ¡
restoration of the Holy Father to freedom    Such, |
said  Mr K , is the couise of the Bank of the I
United States    The doctrines recently promulged ,
here, show us that the control of the currency ism
the hands of that institution, that she may flood I
the country with her notes to any extent not for-
bidden by the charter, and fhat theie is no power
m the State to prevent hei from withdrawing it as
suddenly and as entirely  as  she  pleases     The |
Government deposites may be restrained by the
bank, for the purpose eithei of erabhng it to en-
large its accommodations, or foi the object of with-
drawing «o much of this cm rency from circulation,
neither to be issued by itself ror any other bank
This is undoubtedly tiue, if the Secretary of the
Treasury has no other powei over the deposites
thin that allowed to it by tne report of the Com-
mittee on Finance     If the deposites can be with-
drawn by the Secretary, only in cases where he
deems them unsafe, or when the bank refuses to J
the Government the necessary facilities for trans-
ferring the public funds, how is the bank to be ,
compelled to relieve the wants of the country to
the extent which the deposites may author ze>
Not by scae /anas, nor by jny judicial process,
because such refusal presents no violation of the
terms of the charter    The Government cannot i
reach the conduct of that institution in any other
mode than through the agency of courts and juries,
and if the Sectetary does not hold m his hands the
corrective, the great and sovereign right to regulate
the currency, so indispensable to the freedom of
the country, and to the security of all private prop-
el ty, belongs to the bank, and the Government
itself is made to contribute to the distresses of its'
own ctizens whenever the bank may choose to
wi'hhold from circulation the public depositee
That some parts of the country are now in á con- I
dition of great embarrassment, I have no right to
deny, because the e\idence3 of it uDon the table
are numerous and conclusive    The withdrawal of
the deposites cannot be the cause, unless by that
operaron the amount of the means of banking
accommodation, both State and Federal, has bee^
diminished     It may have been the means of ex
cuing the bad passions of boards of directors, and
thus of dissocialmng the Federal and S ate banks
Tne correction for tins evil is not v^|hm the juris-
diction of Congress, and the applications of our
fellow citizens for rehef should be addressed to the
directois and stockho'ders of the bnik, to con
vmce them that they consult their own mteiests
by making peace
Now, the course the Administration felt them-
selves authorized to take might be gleaned from
what had been said by the gent'eman from New
York, [Mr Wright,] and that appeared to be to
do nothing on this subject Theie wis no relief
to be expected fiom that quarter, because it was
said that the question uf restonng the deposites
was connected with the question of the rechaner
of the present bank, or the establishment of another
in its place Here, then, was the course, as far
as one side had laid it down—and what had been
done by those Senators who had talked the most,
the longest, and the loudest' The Senate had
been six weeks in discussing a question which
cannot, let it be decided one way or the other,
effect anything It would settle nothing The
subject had been íefeired to the Committee on
Finance, who had made a leport on it, and what
did it propose' Precisely what we have been
talking about for the last six weeks, it stated that
the reasons of the Secretary of the Treasury for
the removal of the deposites were not sufficient
The leport did not go into any reasons to show
why the deposites should be restored, nor did it
I look into the effect of a restoration of the depos-
ites. The committee had abstained from express-
ing an opinion as, to whether a restoration would
or would not effect relief Tne Senate, then, had
| been discussing a subject which would eventuate
in noth ng—had been debating a mere abstract
propos'tion
Gentlemen did not propose any relief, but took
occasion to find fault with the Administration
They said there is distress, but said nothing else.
Mr K attributed a wantof confidenceon thepart
of the community, in a great degree, to the language
that had been used by Senators in speaking of
distress To show that what was said in this body
had made an impression on the public mind, he
needed on'y to refer to the memorial which had
been just presented by the gentleman from New
York, it was almost a copy of the language that
had been used here If the people were to be told
that the powers of the Government hid been
usurped—that the President was a tyrant—that
the sword and the pui„e were united in the same
hand, and that dreadful consequences were 1 kely
to grow out of this single act of the Secretary of
the Treasury—why, it wou'd be met extiaordi-
nary, indeed, if these assertions did not make
some impression on the puoiic mmd
Members of Congress must have had less weight
' m the community than they de erved, if somebody
could not be found who would believe what they
said Heie,saidMr Iv ,m this Chamber, where
the vestal lamp should be always ligh'ed, where
the oil should be pressed from the leaf of ¿he olive
1 and poured upon the troubled waters, is the pi-
caño from whence is thiown, all ovei the country,
the material winch alarms our fellow citizens
The remedy which had been proposed for the pres
ent distress, by the resolution of the Senator from
Kentucky, was to extend credit to the merchants
upon then duty bonds This he consideied as a
j partial relief, and it did not reach the whole object
It was a partial measure for the relief of one class
of men, not only to the disregard of all others, but
to the positive injury of all others Itwasaques
tion whether there should be any deposites at ail
many bank. The importers having cred ts ex
I tended, will be leliered, and all other c'ass"S of
men will be deprived of the advantages of the
deposites in any bank, State or Federal ° Would it
1 be sa d that because relief was thus ifforded, it
would be extended n consequence to all í her?__
