OCTOBER 7, 1864.

Major - General SHERMAN:

I left the brigade on Dallas road at 11 a. m. It was at the intersection of the road to New Hope from Hardshell, with the road from Allatoona Church to New Hope, not far from Pickett's Mills, and about two miles from New Hope. Garrard's cavalry was passing them. There is no enemy found. The brigade will support the cavalry. The firing heard is farther south. I have two other regiments pushing on Rome road to its intersection with the direct road from Dallas to Allatoona.

Major - General SHERMAN:

The reconnaissance report no rebels north or New Hope Church, and the main body went south from there this morning. I send to you an Irishman whom they captured, and who gives intelligent account. They used both this road and the direct Dallas and Allatoona road. If my brigade stays at Allatoona I will send up its baggage in the morning, and at same time draw some rations there. It is no farther than Marietta, and better road. Shall I do so?
