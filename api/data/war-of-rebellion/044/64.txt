Camp At Brandy Station, December 22, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following supplemental report of the operations of the One hundred and tenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry on June 13, 14, and 15: The official report to which this is a supplement, dated June 16, 1863, was written from the best data that could then be procured. The movements of the regiment are accurately stated in the original report. The losses in killed and wounded have since been ascertained to be light in a remarkable degree compared with the losses of the enemy. Information of a reliable character received from citizens of Winchester, Va. ; also from published accounts of the enemy, and from admissions made by officers and soldiers captured from him who were engaged in the contest of the three days at and near Winchester, make it safe to estimate his loss in the assault upon our works on the evening of June 14 at 100 killed and 400 wounded. Some reports fix the loss at over 200 killed, besides a large number wounded. The loss of the enemy in the attack made by the regiment on the morning of June 15, exceeded 200 killed, besides sa large number wounded. The total loss of the One hundred and tenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry in the operations of the three days, not including the captured, was 4 enlisted men killed and 1 officer and 50 enlisted men wounded. The great disparity in losses is owing to the fact that on the 14th the regiment was protected by earthworks, while the enemy exposed himself to a heavy fire of infantry and artillery while charging in column; also on the morning of the 15th, the enemy was attacked, surprised, and, for a considerable time, by the rapid firing of the men, kept in disorder. It is also partly attributable to the further fact that when the enemy succeeded in forming to repel the attack, my troops were each time withdrawn before receiving his fire, and a new direction taken, which enabled me to attack the enemy upon his flank and rear, thereby compelling him to fall back, suffering each time heavy loss. The artillery attempted to be used by the enemy on the 15th was not effective, and was soon silenced by the well-directed infantry fire poured upon it. It is worthy of note that the proportion of killed to the wounded in the regiment was little more than 7 per cent. Lieutenant Cron, reported captured, escaped with Captain McElwain's company into Pennsylvania. Lieutenant Weakley with 60 men was left upon picket, in consequence of his whereabouts not being known to me, and a false report that he was with the wagon train. The lieutenant, with most of his men, were left at their post on picket, and alone engaged the enemy at Winchester on the morning of the 15th. After a most gallant resistance, they surrendered. The total number captured was 5 officers and 243 enlisted men, including the sick and 38 of the wounded. A part of the sick and wounded were recaptured in July following. One officer and 12 enlisted men, slightly wounded, escaped with the regiment. Asst. Surg. Thomas C. Owen was captured on the field June 15, but escaped from the enemy at Martinsburg in July following. A list of the captured officers, and killed and wounded officers and enlisted men, is hereto appended. *

I am, very respectfully, your obedient and humble servant,

J. Warren Keifer,

Colonel, Commanding.
