J. M. JOHNSON, Secretary of Statef
By FRANK STRONG, Deputy.
I now call attention to.the testimony of the
secretary of State, who made the canvass,
pages 8 ami 9, printed evidence:
" Question. Do you know Frank Strong, who has
just given his deposition in this case; bow long have
you known him, and did he or did he not act as
chief clerk to thasecretary of State during your term
of office under Governor Clayton; and if so, how
long, and is he or is he not still acting as chief clerk
in said office?
"inwer, I know Mr. Frank Strong, and that he
was giving his deposition here a short time ago;
think I have known him officially about two years
or eighteen months. He was chief clerk and deputy
secretary of State during my term, and under Gov-
ernor Bowjsli.. Clayton* My understanding is that
heis still acting as such; I have no doubt of the fact.
There is a special statute of the Statb of Arkansas
providmgfor the appointment of adeputy secretary
of State, and under that act Mr. Stiong was author-
ized to do or perform any act the secretary of State
was authorized or empowered to do.
" Question. Was there or was therenot an election
for members of Congress held in the State of Arkan-
sas to represent said State in the Forty-Second Con-
gress of the United States in 1870; and if so, when
was that election held; and if held, were returns
made thereof to tho office of secretary of State, and
when were they madeandfully completed, and how
did you receive said returns, by mail or otherwise ?
. " Ansxvr. There was such an election, and it was
held on the 8th day of November, 1870. Returns of
said election were made to the secretary of State of
said State. They were made pursuant to the law of
the State, and received in accordance with law,
and within the time prescribed by law. I mean
they wore sent in as required by law.
" Question. Did you hie or cause said returns to
be filed in your said office, noting the time of the
filing?
"Answer. Yes, sir.
" Question. Please examine the certified copies of
abstracts of the election returns for the third con-
gressional district of said State of Arkansas, pro-
duced by contestant's counsel, marked Exhibits B
and C, and the same referred to in Frank Strong's
deposition, taken in this case on to-day; and state
whether or not said copies of abstracts contnin the
full and complete returns for said third congressional
district; and if not full and complete, state in what
particular said returns are incomplete.
"Answer. I think these papers marked B and C,
are correct, produced before me here. I have ex-
amined said papers and have no question but that
they are correct. They are, I believe, all the returns
of said election, and include everything. I refer to
these Exhibits B and C as parts of my deposition
" Question. Were you or were you not present
when the votes and returns thereof for members ot
Congress to Forty-Second Congress for said btate
of Arkansas were canvassed; and if so, who efse
