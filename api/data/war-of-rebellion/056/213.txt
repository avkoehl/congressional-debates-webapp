General Burnside all the assistance in your power, and if they can be subsisted, draw down to Cumberland Gap re-enforcements from Kentucky. Communicate directly with General Grant and department headquarters, at Cincinnati.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

TAZEWELL, Tennessee, November 21, 1863-11.30 a.m. (Received 5.10 p.m.)

Maj. General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Colonel Graham, finding it impossible to communicate with General Burnside, has just returned. He reports that General Williams has been ordered to Knoxville, and says this is reliable. A rebel scouting party that came up as far as Maynardville, told the citizens that as soon as Knoxville was secured Wheeler was going to Kentucky, and that they meant to capture this command. I shall leave in a few minutes for Cumberland Gap. My infantry is nearly there.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to Grant.)

CUMBERLAND GAP, Tennessee, November 21, 1863-1 p.m. (Received 3.30 a.m., 22d.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received. Part of the message unintelligible. I have directed the operator to repeat it. Several scouting paries still out toward Knoxville. The latest news was at 11 o'clock yesterday morning, when firing was still heard by my advance scout. The firing sounded as if 5 miles below Knoxville, but the large rebel force remained above. Perhaps the rebels were trying to draw Burnside out of his works. I am too distant to help Burnside, but would have marched down from Bean's Station had not his orders been to make sure of communication with the gap.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 21, 1863-1.10 p.m.

Major-General GRANT:

Heavy and regular firing at Knoxville till noon to-day, but some since noon up to the time the messenger left.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to Foster.)
