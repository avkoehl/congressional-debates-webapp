power, and from ibe weat of «ho^e brows flow all
thasweets that luxurious wealih carefully gathers
up to cherish and mspi e its collapsed excitement,
to please its taste, and gratify its pride
But, nr, what sort of privilege is thnt which you
give to the humb'e and unambitious emigrant to
buy the little spot of earth upon which he seats
himse f, w^en compared with the privileges and
bounties wi ichyou bestow upon more highly 'avor-
ed object  cf your kindness? Thecontrnst is strange,
marked and peculiarly distinguishing ' The hn o
ry of this country show  that we have ju^t passed
through a long succes ion of privilege  an 1 be un-
ties to the manufacture^ of privileges and bcun
ties to a great National Bank, and of privileges
and bounties almost every when , except to the
p or and industrious farmer, who ask  you to give
hiin no hmg but protection against the specuia'or—
that the cabin which he rears to shelter the wife of
his bo^om and the pledges of their love, may be sa-
cred against the world' For that price you have set
upon it, he only demands of you to let htm be ih3
purchaser' T' e veiy thought, however, of privi-
lege* and bounties to the honest and industrious
cultivator of the soil, rouses up resistance and pro
vokes denunciation from those who have very bte
ly professed to hold his interest  very caiefully and
tenderly in the hollow of their hand! And how Ion,;,
sir, will gent'emen pause—or will they pause at
all under their keen sense of horror at these pnvi
leges of the husbandman, when they shall come to
erect a vast B ink of the United States, with the
h ghest prerogati e-., and the largest privilege , or
else wnen thaj shall come to call into existence, as
the head of a great banking league, some rotten,
disjointed, prostrate  and still sinking msti utiop,
whose privileges have Leen corrupt and boundless
as her power has been abused and uncontrolled'
All this will not shock the lively sensibilities ot
gentlemen' Tnat banker, and that banktrg m
stttution will with ease galher weolih, and
grasp a thousand landed tides, and even as-
pire to guide and ma tor the political cur-
rent of event-., and they are advoca ed upon
the high public considerat ons of promoting the ge-
neral welfare, whi e the humble laborer, utterly de
nounced, seek  but a home, and, "remote and un-
friended," pursuing "the noiseless tenor cf his way,"
he form> one of the millions on ih  stienpth of
whose arm, and the courage and patriotism of
whose heart, depends the safetj of the Republic Is
there nothing oí the public welfare thaf belonss to
fie destiny of that man? Thi  one of the million?
And shall not the voic of kindness be raised here
to cheer his onward course, and the hand of a wise
policy be extended tj pro ect hii> lonely habitation''
But, sir, this prospective pre-empHOD, as I have
stated, was also denounced as a sytem of rewards
and punishments, applied between the At antic and
the West The wizen of the neglected Atlantic
was described as being left to pursue his ob'cure
pith unknown, and unregarded by the Govern
ment, while the man of the far West rioted in the
pursuit of the wild game of the praints, and ha I
superadded to his pleasuies the highest legislative
rewards The great landed domain has been held
up as that patrimony of the old State  of which
they have been gradually stripped by a similar le>
gislation, and of which we seemed now to be in the
attitude of uluma'ely depriving them, for the bene-
fit of a mo'e favored region The hamlets, the
towns, the c ties, the vast spreading population of
the West, has been grouped in graphic pictures to
impress more strikingly upon our minds how we
h^,ve built them by our legislation, and fo'tered
them by our patronage fhe^e ha\e been
called the rewards to the W«st In contrast
with this, and over whuh the 'ensime ard
sympathizing can scarcely refrain a tear,
we have the neglected condition of the At-
lantic S ates painted with a fervid pencil and a
filial hand Their old fields covered with the growth
of the pine, their village  decayed, th-ir houses de-
serted, and their citizens gone Who, sir, but would
mourn over drsolation like this1 would weep to
witness the infliction of such a punishmerf* There
is noihing, pgrhaps, which more powerfully appeals
to the sympathy of the human heart than the nar-
¡ative of the misfortunes of those who have passed
from the highest tide of prosperity to obsure want
But thai the impression may smk deep and lasting-
ly, the picture must be ju t' A mistake in this is
fatal It wi'l chill your charity, asd dry jour
tears How, th n, doei this work of the imagina-
tion contrast with ?U that meets your eye through-
out the bread Nonhern Atlantic S at^s? They
have advancd in their population, augmented their
commerce, improved and increased their agricul-
ture, adorned and extended the r cities, founded
new ^eats of learning, revived those whose decayisg
1 ghts were going out, and added with a most unexam-
pled rapidity to the private wtaHh of individuals,
the progre s cf the arts and sciences, the building
of roads, the opening of canals, and the laying of
railways, until they have extinguished space, and
almost condensed ih°ir cities to a unit In all this
the broad hand of prosperity has made its deep
and indelible impress This forms a small part of
the pumshweiUt inflicted upon the Atlantic S'ates by
the Ci position of the public lands
But, Mr President, let us inquire, for a moment,
into this system of rewards and punishments,
which has excited so much denunciation I do not
mean to utter any thing unkind, or invidious, or in
the spin of cemp'am1, but m h°nght of rejorder
I may be permuted to contrast the action of this
G-i vernmer t n regard l~¡ the t« o grand division  of
the country—th  Atlartn, o? 'he one side, and the
interior on the other I thmk it requires no great
mental effort to perceive that there is sound philo-
sophy in the paialkl, that tni  division in the Re
public of two great sections ha  a necessary exis -
ence in their natural position It is the history of
all governments, and wbeiever they have had du
rabihty it has b-en by the acuon pni reaction of
balances es'abli'h"! by natural c?uses, and pie
served by a skillful adenim 'rativ- policy In the
West we have land  We therefore want men,
and men and land  consti nte the g eatnrss of oui
po itiop, afid trom which, as a resource, we may
build up a flour shing country. In the progress of
industry hvs i  a necessary con equence It is not
more natural in us, therefore, to ask you to do that
m regard to the public land  which will benefit and
protect the laboring settler, than it is wise in yeu
to grant the demand, because it will, in the end,
promote a common prosperity Such, sir, is the
true "he-ad and front" ot the whde system of re-
wards to the We t' But rot merely to balance
tni  for the pnst, the preient, and through all futute
time, has it never occurred to you that for all the
pottpo«es of taxat on and expenditure, ours is a
Northern Atlantic Givernment, and those Sutes,
are, have be-n, and most probably will con-
Lnue to b° the great recip ents of t le mass
of the public expenditures Tne difference
between us is that ws of the interior a'e tax-
payers, but not receivers of the great holy of tne
appropria ion° In the Atlant c they are tax-pa) -
ers and ret overs too, and their industry is ac ually
stimulated by lh«t which they consume, because tin
premium at which they are p rmit'ej to do it is
returned into their hand , cither for the products of
their soil or their ski 1 in manufae tmes Thus the
vptem of punishments proceeds It is in the At-
lantic State  that you have erected your
most costly palaces and public work  , your
custom house0, and ligM-houses, and, artdfd
to all these, you have improved their harbors I
repeat, sir, I do not speak m the spirit of dissatis
faction, but of justice Our brethren of the North
ern Atlantic do but enjoy their position, perhaps
with no greater tendency to the monopoly of a'l
the moneyed favors of the Government than is na-
tural to man where his s ígh es  capnc  has been
respected, and all his wishe  indulged Thess men
fir whom we a k your protec ion against the spe-
culator, are both tax-payer  and land-bit} er  at
jour own price—and for all this we inflict a punish
ment upon the old S ates, by bui ding our 'hips
there v h°n tney might be constructed on the wa-
ters of the Missis ippi We purchase there almost
all our naval and military stores, when they might
be ob a ned m ths West In the manufacture of
fire arm , and all the munitions of war, Tennessee
and Missouri can offer facilities not to be excelled
in any part of the world, but m the harshness of
our seventy, we punish our friends and fellow citi
zens of the Atlantic, by the manufacture of fhes"e
articles within their bordars, that their raw mate-
rial may be used instead of ours, their skill em-
plojed, and their provisions consumed We have
punished thira by giving to the deaf and dumb
asylum of Connecticut a township of land—and of
the millions appropriated for the support of our
Government, more than fiv°- ixths ate expended
in the Northern Atlantic S atts Above all, we
punish them by expending every surplus dollar we
make in their ports No matter how it comes,
whether from the tcil of th  miner or the plough-
man, the hardy trapper or the trader of Santa Fe,
the wealthy merchant and the manufacturer of the
North gather wuhin tne year the hard earnings of
of the who'e West But, sir, I ought to add that
other, and that last punishment which we inflict
upon them, and from whic% hke the rewards they be-
slow on us, we all derive a commin bwfit. We
punish them by seeking to improve that proud and
glorious navy which prot cts them in war, and
enriches them in peace.
This is a hasty review of th" punishmeiits inflic -
ed up->n the Northern Atlantic, peculiarly; and it
miiit be admitted they are at least gentle and ten-
der In return, sir, though you may call them by
the name of rewards, give to ns similar punish-
ments—so gantle, s0 kind, so modest, «o tender1
Tnat i", Mr, let us have the advaniages of our po-
sition—of land and men—as you have the advan-
tages of your position, and do not seek to become
a great land merchant, holding up your merchan-
d se for h gher prices, or fretting over the appre-
hen ion of the lo s of a fiw cei t' It is notdi-
mqn led by your obligations—it i  unseated to the
greiine'-s 0f youi polic.
Let u  h ar no more, then, of "privileges and
b unties," of "rewatd  ?nd punishments," or of
the eb'cunty of th<= man of the Atante, while that
RilJfd coach paiade  yonder city, and that humb'e
1 iborer delves in the soil cf the far West, and while
that banker has been, or is o be, made yet more
man a mil wnaire, with potent privileges, that
pr noes might envy, while that lonely emigrant asks
leave to pay, from the labor of his hands, the price
>ou have fixed upon the little spot of earth where
he ha  reared his log cabin, and placed in it, as its
q teen, ihe wife of his bosom, the partner of his
pen s and his toils
In me word be tow upon the men of the West
who bhall go ihere, those kind, tlo e gentle, and
those tender puní hmenls whicT we bestow upon
th Noithern A Untie Give us, I repeat, the ad-
van ages of oiu posit on a  \*e give to you thead-
vaotag^of yours, and do it not grudgingly
Mr President, Í now turn to what was done for
the French sutlers and Polish exiles, as adverted
to m the course of th s debite I had the laws b -
fore me at ihe moment they were referred to, but
I confess my mmd took a very different directicn
fiem what appeared to be to be the opm on on the
other side of ih   House Froon ihe legalargumer t
winch was made b/ on  gentleman, I had at fiM
mfe'red that w<" wou d have rete ved some addi-
tional a din the support of this quest on But,
s r, I little expected that the charity which mduc:d
Senators to vo'e a township of land, at the mini-
mum price, and a credit of tei years to the unfor-
tunate Polish exiles, would so soon have given way
when a less gracious d ed was to be done to our
own citiz-rs, mingled it migit be with the few who
who should seek to escape (rom the opp'esstons of
fore gn de^po ism In that very vote, which I now
have before me, are the names of many Senatois
who are now honored by seats upon this floor, and
gave to that measure theu sane ion. I d i not, sir,
m an to hud fa il' with thtt ptailege and bounty act,
nor with thepimis'im'jii it mast have inflicted upon
th" Atlantic, if the po mon be true, as taken in
this debate, that this bill is one of punishments to
the Atlantic States' That at required no dec'ara-
tion of their intention to b come ci iz ns, nor have
yiur land laws ever required such a proce ding on
ill- part of me purchasers.of whatever country they
nyght be Either the chanty to those exiles was wrong
then, orbss charily to ourown citi7 n=,and to fore gn-
ers generally, the men of log cabins, is right now'
There is no escape from this conclusion' As far
as the question of any declaration of citizenship is
