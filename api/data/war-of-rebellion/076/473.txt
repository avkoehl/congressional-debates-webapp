HDQRS. CHIEF OF ARTY., DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division:

Your dispatch of this date received. You are mistaken as to any spirit of jealousy on the part of the Army of the Cumberland toward the Army of the Tennessee, so far as I am concerned. As soon as General Barry informed me (3 p.m. yesterday) that he desired a 4 1/2-inch gun to place on General Corse's front it was instantly ordered with a supply of ammunition. If I am to be censured for disobedience of orders on the report of General Barry it would be well for him to obtain facts. I inclose copies of telegrams to him.* The firing shall continue with the rapidity you desire.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier General and Chief of Artillery, Dept. of the Cumberland.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta (at General Schofield's),

August 12, 1864-11 a.m.

General THOMAS:

I am at General Schofield's headquarters, which is now on the Sandtown road, and I should think nearly abreast of East Point. The general is out on a reconnaissance in force, and I wish you to keep things lively, that no concentrating or massing may be made as against General Schofield.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 12, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have kept up a continuous demonstration on the enemy all day, both skirmishing and artillery firing. No movements of his troops have been reported to me by any of my officers on lookout.

Two 20-pounder Parrott guns have burst; have caused the firing to cease with the two others till morning. The ammunition for 4 1/2-inch guns (1,100 rounds) will be here by 8 a.m. to-morrow, when the firing will be immediately resumed. Your dispatch of this evening received; will be over in the morning and bring a rebel paper giving account of the Mobile affair.
