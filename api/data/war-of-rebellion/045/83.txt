BEALETON STATION, June 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General PLEASONTON:

Your dispatch of this morning is received. I wish you would send the brigade to Warrenton at once, and send me, in the direction of Little Washington, a force sufficient to ascertain with certainty whether the enemy are moving up into the Valley or not. Waterloo Bridge can be watched from the force at Warrenton. This reconnaissance from Warrenton should leave to-night.
