HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865.

[Lieutenant Colonel C. A. WHITTIER:]

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that a small force from the Fourth Brigade charged the enemy's picket-line near my right and drove them into their works drawing fire from their intrenchments. The officer in charge thinks the works were occupied by a line at least one rank deep. A similar demonstration at about the center of my picket-line by a party of 200 men from the First Brigade failed of success, they being repulsed by the enemy's picket-line. I have ordered another charge by the same 200 from First Brigade at a point farther to my left.

Very respectfully,

NELSON A. MILES,

[46.] Brevet Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

COLONEL: General De Trobriand has sent out a reconnoiter party and reports that there is no change in the enemy's picket-line, and that his (the enemy's) works are fully manned and the men are cheering.

Very respectfully,

G. MOTT,

[46.] Brevet Major-General.
