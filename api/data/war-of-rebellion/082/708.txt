Lieutenant Colonel LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

COLONEL: Brigade commanders report that the enemy is constructing earth-works at the right of the railroad, apparently for heavy guns; the position is such as would enable him to enfilade a portion of our lines at the left of the railroad. This is the only movement detected in our front.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Before Petersburg, July 31, 1864-8 a.m.

General J. WHITE,

Chief of Staff, Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report little picket-firing during the night. Some of our wounded crept in during the night and early this a.m. About 50 are reported yet lying between the lines and some 200 or 300 dead. I have had the honor already to ask that a truce may be had, if possible, to get in the wounded and dead. Much labor will be required to repair the breast-works and abatis. The enemy show a new line of pits to their left and rear of the crater.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
