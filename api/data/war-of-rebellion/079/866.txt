HEADQUARTERS,Courtland, October 29, 1864 -1 p. m.

Lieutenant -General LEE,

Commanding Corps:

General Hood directs that you move early in the morning to Bainbridge Crossing on the Tennessee and give necessary aid to the engineer troops in laying the pontoon bridge at that point. So soon as the bridge is ready cross your command and take position to protect the bridge and the crossing of the remainder or the army. Strengthen your position on the other side in every way you can by entrenching, &amp;c. When you arrive at the river, should you find the enemy on the opposite side, you will put troops over in the boats, with as little delay as possible, and drive off the enemy, so that the bridges can be placed across the river. Colonel Pressman, chief engineer, will be with you this evening or tomorrow with may further instructions General Hood may have for you.
