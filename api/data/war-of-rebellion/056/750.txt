DUBLIN, November 24, 1863.

Maj. Gen. S. JONES,

Care P. C. Warwick, Richmond:

General Ransom telegraphs that the enemy have crossed from Morristown and Bull's Gap to Bean's Station; said to be retreating to Cumberland Gap. Cavalry trying to overtake and intercept them. He goes to Kingsport to-morrow with all the troops. He desires to know whether he must stay on this side of the Holston. I answered that he must exercise his own judgment and act as he thinks best. General Lee telegraphs that we hold all roads to Knoxville except that between the Holston and French Broad. Desires you to push the enemy.

CHARLES S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE, Dublin, November 24, 1863.

Maj. Gen. R. RANSOM, Jr., Bristol:

General Bragg reports all roads leading into Knoxville in our possession except that between the Holston and French Broad. Wheeler has cut off trains of the enemy from Cumberland Gap. You must exercise your own judgment upon the information you have.

CHARLES S. STRINGFELLOW,Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS, November 25, 1863.

General BRAGG:

Do let the division come on or take it back entire. Your dispatch informed me that two divisions were ordered. I now learn that it is two brigades that may come, and without artillery. The break of the bridge is of advantage, I think, as the locomotives and trains do not pass each other so frequently.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.

LOUDON, November 25, 1863-5 p.m.

General LONGSTREET:

The enemy's cavalry are in sight of Charleston and moving on the bridge. We have but one regiment at Charleston. Brigadier-General Kelly was ordered yesterday to return with his whole command to the right of Bragg's army. Colonel Rucker with about 150 cavalry is all that guards the Tennessee from the Hiwassee to Kingston.

B. R. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.
