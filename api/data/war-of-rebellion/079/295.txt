CHATTANOOGA, October 15, 1864-12 midnight.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have information that the enemy (a corps of infantry and Wheeler's cavalry) moved WEST from Dalton yesterday. The railroad is destroyed to near Tunnel Hill. Colonel Wright will start parties to repair it in the morning. I am disposing the troops to protect the road from this place to Bridgeport, and reopen the way to Resaca.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Colonel Hays will forward this dispatch from Ringgold by messenger.

CHATTANOOGA, October 15, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Nothing new this morning from the enemy. I have sent out a train with the Ringgold and Tunnel Hill garrisons, with orders to go back to their posts if practicable. Have not heard from them yet.

I will have Wagner's DIVISION ready to move down as soon as I hear from the advance force already sent.

SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Citizens report a rebel force at Tunnel Hill, and track broken about that place; no particulars known. Wagner's DIVISION is now starting for Ringgold and Morgan's will go to-morrow. General Steedman informs me that the Ninth Ohio Cavalry is detained at Stevenson. I have not healed from the Sixth Indiana or the battery. I need cavalry very much.

SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General THOMAS:

My information leads me to believe that the enemy, after destroying the railroad between Resaca and Tunnel Hill, has moved westward, probably with the purposes of striking the road between this point and Bridgeport. Colonel Hays telegraphs from Ringgold that a portion of
