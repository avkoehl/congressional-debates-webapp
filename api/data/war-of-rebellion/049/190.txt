[CHAP. XLI.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-1. 30 p. m.

Commanding Officer Third Corps:

The commanding general directs that you concentrate your command at or in the vicinity of Fox's Mills to-day prepared to cross the river. Your headquarters can remain where they now are, unless you think it best to change your position, and in that event you will leave an officer with a suitable party at the telegraph station to receive and forward messages.

Please acknowledge.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-6. 10 p. m.

Commanding Officer Third Corps:

The commanding general authorizes you to mass your command at Freeman's Ford, instead of Fox's Mills as heretofore ordered. The general wishes you, if practicable, to find a road to Culpeper which does not cut the roads from Sulphur Springs and Rappahannock Station to that place.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, September 15, 1863.

General WILLIAMS:

My command is all within striking distance of Beverly Ford. Before one portion of it could cross the river, the remainder would be closed on the forward.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.

RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, September 15, 1863-7. 50 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS:

In one place Beverly Ford is nearly 3 feet deep, the bottom very rough, and the entrance and outcome very soft and boggy. It will be very difficult for the artillery and trains to cross. Is it intended to throw a bridge or not? If it is, the spot in front of Hamilton's house is the best place for it.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,September 15, [1863]-7. 50 p. m.

Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you have your command well in hand, so that, if it is necessary to fall back, you will have your command ready to work it. Have you train well out of the way.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. ROSS SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief of Staff.
