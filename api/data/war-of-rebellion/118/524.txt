HEADQUARTERS, Camp Chase, April 25, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,Commissary - General of Prisoner, Washington City, D. C.

COLONEL: Inclosed I have the honor to submit a plan of a sent of regimental quarters that at a period when by a large excess beyond the means to supply accommodation for prisoners it was rendered an imperative necessity on the part of the (then) commanding officer to set apart as a prison. The blue [black] line exhibits the entire space inclosed, while the red [dotted] indicates that portion exclusively used for prison purposes, the remaining portion being occupied by the Governor's Guards. A substantial fence

(shown by the red lined) surrounded the prison proper, whole that round the quarters of the Governor's Guards is in a state of dilapidation. My opinion is concurred in but not only the surgeon but the officers of the Governor's Guards and the post

* [MAP]

generally that the presence of the last - named fence is injurious to the heath of the command, shutting it out as it does from proper ventilation by a free circulation of air.

The location of this prison is most inappropriate, situated as it is immediately in front of (not more than a half dozen rods from) the commanding officer's headquarters, and besides being nearly in the center of the camp. The entire drainage (which by the bye is sadly deficient) from it passes to the east through an open ditch in the midst of the most eligibly located portion of the camp. In view of these facts I would respectfully recommend that the quartermaster be authorized to remove the fence and restore the quarters to their original use. Or is in the opinion of the commissary - general of prisoners a necessity exists for the present excess of prison room that at least that portion of is surrounding the quarters of the Governor's Guards
