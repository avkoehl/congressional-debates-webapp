General WASHBURN,

Memphis:

Don't send off your cavalry very far, not beyond Grenada, Oxford, or Pocahontas. Let them maneuver about that circle, and await the next combination. Montgomery and Selma must be taken from the direction of Mobile and held. That is General Canby's task. Help your neighbors if possible always. General Howard sees this, and will telegraph you also.

Your dispatch received. Direct General Veatch to await orders at Memphis. It is not now necessary to send any troops as a diversion in our favor. Use your troops to keep the enemy well away from your front, striking with every opportunity. Have your entire command thoroughly reorganized and equipped for future operations.
