Major-General REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

GENERAL: In obedience to your request for my opinion as to the probable number of troops required to hold the post of Fort Smith and its dependencies, I have the honor to state that if Forts Nos. 2 and 4 (Fort Smith) are remounted with the guns taken out under the previous order of evacuation of that post that the troops, consisting of the First and Second Regiments Arkansas Cavalry (either mounted or dismounted), First and Second Regiments Arkansans Infantry, and First Arkansas Battery, will be sufficient for the purpose of garrisoning the posts of Fort Smith, Van Buren, and Fayetteville; two companies stationed at Van Buren, and four at Fayetteville.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Dispatch received and attended to. Provost- marshal system in Missouri is oppressive and absurd. I am examining into and will correct the whole matter.
