1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ing in Rochester there was some disorder and a
division of opinion on the question of adopting
the resolution which condemns the sentiment that
the election of a President by] a constitutional ma-
jority, having views of public policy with which
the minority do not coincide, would furnish a just
cause for a dissolution of the Union, and which
pledges support to a President constitutionally
elected and protection in the lawful discharge of
his duties, from all enemies within or without, at
home or abroad. On that resolution the commit-
tee which reported the resolutions were equally
divided; on all the rest they were unanimous.
The resolutions were, however, all reported by
the committee and all adopted by the meeting, as
appears by the reportof their proceedings. I think
the division of the committee on the resolution
mentioned did not arise from any disagreement as
to the sentiment of the resolution, but from the
reluctance of the Democrats on the committee to
give expression to any sentiment that might offend
their party friends in Congress who are in the
habit of talking of a dissolution of the Union upon
the happening of this or that contingency.
The meeting at Rochester was called by a large
list of signatures, without distinction of party; and
1 especially call the attention of Senators on the
Democratic side of the Chamber, who have ex-
pressed a purpose to dissolve the tlnion of the
States if a Republican shall be elected to the oflicc
of President, to the fact that Democrats partici-
pated largely in the proceedings of the meeting.
The published letters from those not present, m
reply to invitations to attend the meeting, are all,
or nearly all, from prominent and distinguished
Democrats of the State, and all, every one of them
in favor of the Union. I can say to those Sena-
tors with entire confidence that, m any attempt
to carry into execution any such purpose as a dis-
solution of the Union, they would no more re-
ceive aid or comfort in New York from those who
act politically m the organization of the Demo-
cratic party, than they would from open and
avowed Republicans who denounce disuniomsts
as enemies of the country, no better than traitors.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. What dispo-
sition docs the Senator propose to make of the
resolutions just read ?
Mr. KING. I move that they be laid on the

IIOUMAS LAND GRANTS.
Mr. SLIDELL. I ask that the petition of res-
idents and owners of the Houmaa lands in the
parishes of Ascension and Iberville, in the State
of Louisiana, praying that the act approved June
% 1858, to provide " for the location of certain
confirmed private land claims m the State of Lou-
isiana, ana for other purposes," maybe repealed,
and that Congress will direct any investigation it
may see fit into the subject of these claims, be
withdrawn from the files of the Senate.
Under ordinary circumstanccs, Mr. President,
this petition should have taken the direction of
a reference to the Committee on Private-Land
Claims; but, inasmuch as the course of my col-
league directly, and of myself indirectly, in rela-
tion to the passage of the bill referred to as to the
matter involved in this petition has been impugned,
and my colleague is still chairman of the Com-
mittee on Private Land Claims, 1 thinly it would
not be proper that this paper should take that
direction. The next most appropriate committee
would be the Committee on the Judiciary; and
I now make the motion that the reference bo made
to that committee; but I will not ask the present
consideration of the subject by the Senate. 1 wiU
defer the consideration of my motion until the
opposite parties, who I understand are now rep-
resented by their agents in Washington, shall
manifest a dissent from such a course. If they
think proper to ask for a special committee, or
suggest to me that it woultl be more agreeable to
them, and more promotive of the public interests,
that a special committee should be appointed for
that purpose, my colleague apd myself will very
chrcrfully assent to such a reference. My motion
now is, that the paper be taken from the files and'
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. I do
not ask for the present consideration of the
motion.
Mr. COLLAMER. I would suggest to the
Senator, though I do not wish to object to his
couise at all, that he should rccolicct that his col-
league is also a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Mr. SLIDELL. I ought to observe that my
colleague in relation to this matterâI have anti-
cipated that objectionâof course would not act as
a member of the Judiciary Committee, and would
not participate in its deliberation's. I do not wish
the present consideration of the subject. ] am
perfectly willing that, if the agents of these par-
ties who have made charges which I will not pre-
tend now to qualify by their proper name, are
desirous that a reference should be made to a select
committee, and do not desire its investigation by
the appropriate committee, I have no objection;
neither has my colleague.
The PR.ESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator
does not ask the consideration of the motion to-
day.
Mr. SLIDELL. I leave it until to-morrow. I
am perfectly willing that the Senator from Ver-
mont should make a motion for the reference to
a special committee, and I will accept it.
Mr. COLLAMER. I never had a man speak
tome on the subject in the world. I merely wished
to bring to the gentleman's mind the fact that his
colleague was on the Judiciary Committee, and he
could as well act on one committee as the other,
the Committee on Private Land Claims being the
appropriate committee ordinarily.
Mr. SLIDELL. The difference is this: my
colleague is chairman of the committee on Private
Lund Claims, and probably it would not be ex-
actly in order that he should not be present at the
deliberations of that committee. This objection
does not apply to the Judiciary Committee: and
if nny gentleman now present chooses to nm^nd
