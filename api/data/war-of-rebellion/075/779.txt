The ordnance wagons will be turned to the left on arriving at the Big Shanty and Marietta road, and go into part at the base of Kenesaw Mountain, on the south side. The artillery will move under the direction of Colonel Beckham.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I held my position on the hill by Widow Green's until the Yankee infantry charged in heavy column upon my front, with line extending clear across those two forty-acre fields.
