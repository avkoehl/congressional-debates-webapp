to notice what was said m debate m the other House, because
the member thus noticed could have no opportunity of reply
mg, but it was fir different with legard to any measure which
might be acted on by that body, or passed over without action
Are no their journals ¡.said Mr W ] sent to us every day, for
the pulpóse oí letting us ami the country know what they are
d ung, and shall we refiam ft oil speaking of what is notonous
so e\ ery bodv Besides, ll we send them a measure which is
not acted on 1 r three month's it is natural to suppose that it is
dead and buried Why it waa the height of affectation tp
say that it was irregular and unparliamentary to notico the
proceedings in the other House
It was idle to have doubts on this subject when every body
knew the common course of things was to speculate on the
probable fate of measures pending in either House With re
eard to the effect produced by our measures, and the effect pro
duced by the delay to act on them m the o lu r House, had not
every body a light to know and comment on it? Are we not
surrounded by millions of active, intelligent, and industrious
citizens, whoi>e interests are deeply concerned, and are we to
shut oui eyes as if we are not seen by them? fcuch a course of
conduct was not becoming our condition, or consistent with oui
obligations to the countiyi I see that the country enteitained
the hope tha, after the passage of the joint lesolution rescind
mg the Treasury Oidei, no furthei attempt would be made to
take up the Sub Treasury bill, and that the returning prosperi
ty of the country would not be interrupted But the gentle
man said that ihe same thing as this joint resolution was
passed by this body five months ago, m a clause ol the Sub
JTieasiuy bill, ami theiefote, it could not have produced the
effect attributed to u But did it receive the sanction of the
othei Houoe? Did it tecome a Jaw? It did not and, conse
quently, it was to the passage of tl is jomtiesolution, as a dig
tinct measure, thit the returning prosperity of the country was
tobe attiibuted
When it was seen that both branches of Congress, with a
degree of unexampled eagerness and unanimity, had til en the
subject of this joint icsolution out of the Sub Treasury bill,
and passed it as a separate measure, the people had a n§ht to
understand thn the bill would not be acted on, ind to "peak of
this was couriered the Senatoi asiutgulai and unpaiiiamen
tary Undei tht sta e of things existing on the adoption of the
joint resolution, the pibhc had a right to expect that theie
would be no fui ihei attempt te agin e the country by reviving
this measuie, which was considered as defunct As to any at
tempt on his part to reprimand the other House, he did not
believe thit any rnembei of that body would consider what he
imd said tn that I ght
Mr BEN TON lose a°am to say that, since he had sat down,
a member of the House had communicated to him a piece of
infoimation, which if tiue, would seive as a key to unlock the
door which would give a view of the secret springs which put
this day s proceedings m motion The infoimation is, that a
letter has this day been received from Philadelphia, stating that
a bank meeting was held in that city on Wednesday night last,
and that the Bank ot the United States put herself at the head
of non resumption, and actually gave the casting vote against
taking measures foi íesummg This is the information It
nyvy be true, or it my n >tbe Of this I know nothing, but if it
is true—-if that ¡Bank either has fallen back, oi means to fill
back, upon the non resumption policy indicated in the Apul
lett'rtoltfr Adams then the broad light of diy is shed upon
the movement which we have just witnessed Then *e see

finding that the reasons given in the cotton bag letter ate too
contemptible to be tolera ed by the public, a change of rea ons
must be effected and this notable scheme of a new panic about
the Independent Treasury bill seems to be the delectable dev ice
fallen upon' Sir I dispist such trickery I abhor it I le
nounce it upon this flnor and 1 call upon the feena'e and the
American people to mark ir, and toiemembcr it and when
the new distress commence^, and when the chm us of accusation
resounds against the Government let the legations of tl is day
ne recollected, and letthefineer of (he miscalled Bank of the
United States be seen, dree ting the whole mischief, and charg
mg it upon ¡he Government
Mr WEBSTER nidhe would rathpr have the hot stones on
hi« head than some of the documente The penileinnn seemed
to insist that he spoke with 'he knowledge of the \iews of the
Pennsylvania Bank of the United States This he Mr W
chose to deny He only knew what the bank published to the
world, and nothing more The gentleman dealt a good deal in
the motives of other , buttake away that part jif his. argument,
and he would to found in the condition of that warrior of ariti
qui ty who when he was deprived of all his weapons that had
been poisoned contrary to the rules of war, was found to have
no weapons left
Mi NÍLES said that h,e was about rising just as the warbo
tween the giants [alluding to Mr Webster and Mr Benton]
commenced, but after such a fight, he might perhaps omit
what he had intended to say He had supposed, or at least
hoped, that the bank war, or what some called the war of the
Government upon the banks, but what he considered as
the war of the banks and die bank petitioneis upon the
Government, had ceased He had hoped that if there could not
be a permanent peace, which the country and all the interests
so much desired, we might at least have a truce—a temporary
suspension of hostilities We all certainly have had a right to
expect this, since the appearance of a certain document from
the head of one of the belligerent parties The paper referred
to, was on us face a declaration of peace, or at least a declara
tion of the cesation of hostilities It came upon us somewhat
unexpectedly, ar d was, no doubt, rceived joyously by the peo
pie, tired, if not exhausted in this cuirency wai It occasioned
the more surprise, because it wa* but a lew w ocks before that
a new and foimal manifesto was issued fiom the same high
source, settm* forth at length the causes of the war, we were
told that the two parties were m the field face to face, that it
was to be a wai of extermination, that there was no neutral
ground, that there could be no compionuse, that one of the par
ties must conquer Either the credit system oi the hard money
system, as this manifesto called the policy o! the Government,
must fall Ihe Tieasury Ordti ot luly, 1^36, was named as
one of the causes of the war, but by no means a pi omment one,
the alleged hostility and deiermmatu n of the Government to
destroy the- banks, seems to havt been icgndedas the principle
cause foi continuing hostil ties, as set forth in thin famous
manifesto
Immediately after the passage of the act which supeiseded
the Treasury Order, a proclamation was put forth declaring
that the repeal of the Spi cie Circular had removed all causes of
war, and we were told that this unhappy controversy was now
at an end that the currency was to be restored, and all hostili
ties weie to cease
Mr N bud under these circumstaeces he had not doubted
that we should, at least have a truce, and that the country
would, fora time, enjoy a hule repose, which all seemed so anx
ious for, the merchants, manufactures, and even the banks,
all classes seemed rejoiced at the prospect of returning once
moie, after so long an interruption, to their accustomed pur
suits of business
But, sii, within afewdays past, these favorable indications
of a termination of thi*t controversy appear to have suddenly
change I, and fresh evidences of hostility have appeared The
new Treasmy Order, which lis predicated on the existing
laws, is seized upon us as a fresh aggression on the part of the
Government, and new cause of war We are also now told by
the Senator from Massachusetts, fMr Webster,] that there is
a renewed determination on the pait of Congress to pass tho
Independent Treasury bill, that this has alarmed the country,
and was beginning to agitate the public mind ant w He *Mr,
N liad heard the remaiks of the Senator with surpn e, and
considering his known connection and influent e with the c\i<s
who control tht moneyed institutions and mteie&ts ofthecoun
tr>, he could not but consider his remarks taken m con
net turn with the other circumstances to which he had refened,
as strong evidence that attempts were to beienewed, to airest
the progiess ol resumption and piolong th° piesent state of
tilings " Is the proffered truce to be rt called, the resumption
niGbied a id a new panic to be t, it up?
1 h.p ¡senator '-tys that the country has been led to believe
that the Independent Treasury bill wis to be ibmdoned and
tim the pohcy of the \d Ministration was changed and if he
did not s iy, seemed to insinuate that it was this state of publn
opinion which had encouraged thf banks to resume, and led to
the improvement which had taken place m the monetary
athirs ol the country and the revival ot business We are then
told of alarm and newagitition of (he public mind, by a re
rewed attempt to piss the Independent lieasury bill and new
measuies from the Executive nnfnendly to resumption
Mi N said he believed all these statements to be mcor-ect
feo far as hewas infoimed, thtre wis no such public opinion
The country did not believe that there had been any change ot
pohcy on the part of the AdmimsU&uon or its friends noi did
they believe that Congress ha 1 abandoned the Treasury bill
wh ch paaicd the Senate He knew not what information the
Senatoi may have leceived, or from what sources it Is? derived
he may have means of infoimation m relation to a particular
Uas=« n< tenjoyed by others, but he, Mr N spokeof theordmai v
channds of n telhgence the pubht pi ess and public meetings,
which we must regard as the surest indications of pübhc sentí
ment He had seen nothing in the publn pre<w, eitlur on one
side oi the othei, of tl e A lministrttion, that even Kd him to
usptct that ai opinu n i r vailed with any party, or any por
tion of the public that there had bren, or was to be, any change
of p )licy on the part of the Admimsuation or us friends m
Coti-ire'-" -md so far as íespectcd his coircspon lence, it was
in peiffct haimony with what he resided as the tone gf the
public pi ess Instead of the expiop&u n of an opinion that the
Independent Treasury bill was ab¡ n lontd his conespon IrnH
who made anj al uston to the suhje t expressed the «strongest
conv ¡etions that the bill ought to be acted upon and passed at
the present MF-vion Aid, Mr 1'iesident, i& it piobible, or
sosreely possible, that an opmKn can have prevailed to any
ex ent with any portion of the puhht, that the Treasury bill
would be voluntatily abandoned, or that there had been an>
change in the views of the mijonty in Congress or the Fxeeu
tue in relation to it* Has thete been any act an proceeding
ofeitha branch of Congie«s ot any Lxecutive mea uie, wrich
authonzt 1 an> •nich opinion? None lias been re J ei ltd to, be
cause none pit is t except the nagitivs circumstance that tl t bill
which passed the ben ate has not been taken up in the Hon c
This is the only circumstance íehul upon but the < thy is
generally ttndeistoodtr have ansm horn the peculiai f ondmon
of the House, being nearly equally equally di\ ided on thi ouus
tion us having been occuj led with other business and the
t mbairabbments from its own rtiteb T! ere has been no mu
mat on by any of thefnei ds> of the measuie that it w«.<- to be
abandoned and no want ofdisposiion to an upon it at the
earliest possible per od Kut why should It be infened thit
this measure was given up, because it has not been acted upon^
TlisisaH  the  ras11 of all the important bills which have
Eassed the Senate    The Army bill, the Steamboat bill, the two
■and billb, and others, all had slept in the same way    He
learnsd that one of the Land bills was now under consideration
Has it been supposed by the public that all these-bills have
been abandoned? He presumed not Why, then, shoald it
be inferred that the Treasury bill, the moet important me&sma
of the session, and upon which the Senate had spent nearly four
months at the extra and the present session, was to he aban-
doned, simply because the action upon it has been delayed in ihft
House?
What act, then, has there been ef eithar House that could
have given use to the opinion which we are told exists? He
knew ol none a bill, u is true, has passed, superseding tha
Treasury Order of July, 1836 But that b, úl only contained
the single principle that there should be no discrimination in
the different branches of the revenue, but it had nothing to
do with the management of the finances, or the currency in
which they aie tobe collected and disbursed These depend
on the joint resolution of 1816, and the deposite act ot
1836 But, instead of there having -been any thing done
to authorize an opinion that there was a change of po
licy since the Independent Treasury bill passedthe Sé
nate, the proceedings of the Senate mu"t have satisfied
the country that there was no change If there has been no
movement m the House, there certainly has been here The
views of this body have been constantly brought into discus-
sion, and particularly in the various proceedings upon the re
«solution «f the Senator from Kentucky, {Mr Clay } The
able report of the committee, the debate, and all the proceed
ings of the Senate on that resolution, must have satisfied the
countiy that in this body, at least, there has been no change
We go for a separation, if we cannot obtain that, we take what
comes neaiest to it If we cannot carry that measure, we
choose to remain where we are, we do not intend bunging
about a more intimate connection be'ween the Government
and the banks than results Aom existing laws, unless it be so
to modify tho deposite act of 1836 as to remit the forfeiture
the banks have incurred by the suspension of payments
We are willing to place them where they were when that act
was passed, or before the suspension More than this they
can nave no claims to There are restrictions in thai act,
which  if the connection between the Government and the
banks is to be revived, we intend to ho^d on to This w
our position, and it is, or certainly ought to be, known to the
country There has been no act, no proceeding of the Senate,
mconsibtent with it And yet we are told thatthe public hare
supposed that the policy of the Administration and its friends
is changed, and it is intimated that ¿t is this opinion, that a
moie favorable^ course was to be pursued in relation to the
banks, that has encouraged and favored resumption'tfojfs fai
Sir, the banks which" have resumed have acted from a
more, just view (ff this subject, iftey have not been influenced
by any supposed change m the policy of the A^mistratiou
They have not looked to the Government for aid or encou-
ragement They do not ask it, or desire it, it is only the poll
ticians, and the political banks, that desire this the banks
which have resumed, have done it from their own resources,
they rely on their own means, and them alone, they depend
on their own strength, by which they expect to stand or fall
They know that tho Government has not, and will not, op-
pose them, or, m the language of the day, make war upon
them This is all they ask, they know that to depend on the
revenues ofthe Government, would be to lean on a precari
ous prop, which, the very moment it is most wanted, migtd
be removed
The resumption has not commenced, and gone on thus
far, m consequence of any real or supposed change in the
policy of the Administration, or of tha majority m Congress,
and if it rs now to be arrested, and a renewed effort made to
prolong the present state oí things, let it not be supposed that
it can be successfully charged upon any new indication of an
unfriendly policy towards the banks If, m he feared was the
case, the resumption is to be arrested or such an attempt
made, a new panic got up, and the country forced to suf
fer still longer the evils and difficulties of a suspension, let
it not be supposed that it can be charged upon the Admu
nistration"
That this will be attempted, however, cannot be doubted
The country has been told from high authority thatthe contro-
versy was at an end, and that the currency was now to be re
stored Is this proclamation to be revoked and the war about
the currency to be continued"? There are many indications
that such is the case and the speech of the Senator from Mas
sachusetts is not at all calculated to remove these apprehen
moos, considering his connection with the sources whence these
inductions have appeared
If the resumption is to bearrested, and the derangement and
suspension of business prolonged, it is natural that new grouffds
of complaint should be sought for, and urged upon the public
mind If the war is to be íesumed, new causeg must be as
signed, the old ones ha*e lost their force !>ome new aggres
feions on the part of the Executive, oi Consrress, must be found
out and made upe of, to justify the renewal of hostilities The
new Specie Cucular is doubtless to be one, and the refusal of
Congress to repeal or modify some of the restrictiORs oí the
deposite act of 1*336 maj be another W e are already told that
there is a new alarm and agitation ot the public mind, in regard
to the measures cf the Government
Sir if there is a design to arrest resumption, and prolong the
presen difficulties, let me say to those engaged in it, whether
htre or elsewhere, that they assume ahea'vy responsibility
Let me also fcay to them, they will not succetd The people,
ofal! parties ha\e got tired of this war about the currency and
the banks they want a ret-pite at least, and all are anxious for
thruevivil oi business 1ms war has been kept up by a nmon
between the politicians and the banks, the merchants and the
manufacturers The ?dvantages of it have resulted to the
politicians a one T) the other classes engaged in the contest,
it has been attended with heavv sacrifices, these they have
borne lor moie than a yeai cheerfully butthe> have foi some
time st own sjmptous of uneasimss and thssatiafaétion, they
begin to be satisfied that it is a contest m which they are to
mike the sacrifices, ard the politicians to reap the advan

1 he merchants and manufacturers ne\ er engage m these p£
nic t ontests as an ei d, but on1} as a means When their bun
ness becomes deranged, and almost at a stand, being unable to
perceive the true cause ofthe difficulty, they readily behéve
what is told them by then political friends, that all the difluí
ties arise from the measures of the Government, which is wag
mg war on the banks, and trying experiments on the curreftpf
