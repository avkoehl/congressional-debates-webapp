ORDER IN RELATION TO SALE OF UNSERVICEABLE QUARTERMASTER'S PROPERTY.

I. Chief quartermaster of military departments, the chief of the inspection division, and the regularly assigned inspectors of the Quartermaster's Department will immediately cause to be made and forwarded to the Quartermaster-General invoices of such articles of clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and quartermaster's stores as, on personal inspection, they may find unserviceable or worthless to the Government; and also of such articles as it would be more economical to the Government to seal than to ship to other points.

All proceedings subsequent to any order of sale that may be given will be conducted according to the Regulations, by due advertisement, &amp;c.

II. No sale of public buildings, barracks, quarters, stables, &c., will be made except on an order of the Quartermaster- General, approved by the Secretary of War, indorsed upon a report to be made in each case in the usual from.

By order of the Secretary of War:
