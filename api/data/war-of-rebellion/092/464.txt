HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton head, S. C., November 14, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose to you a Savannah paper of the 12th instant, brought in by the flag- for- truce boat. The exchange is progressing favorable, I believe, under Colonel Mulford's direction. Reports from Morris Island represent that there are appearances for commotion among the rebels in Charleston and on James Island. I shall go up there to- night o see what is the matter. I hope and trust that it may be caused by the approach of General Sherman in the rear. Such a movement would be the finest of the war, a d would capture Charleston and Savannah with all their stores of cannon, ammunition, and material, and open bases of supplies from which with his army he could utterly destroy and devastate the whole State of South Carolina.
