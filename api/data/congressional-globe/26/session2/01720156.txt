THE BANKRUPT LAW     '
The bill lo establish a uniform system o^ bank-
ruptcy thn ughout the Uni ed States was tak^h up,
a'  in commute of ihe whole
Mr HENDERSON resumed the debate, and re
viewed the operation of the Iw as proposed by the
Senator fiom New Hampshire, it adopted, on
banking and other mo rpor<«tions, and the power of
Congress so far to extend such a provision If
this bill could made to include one incorporation,
he argued that H could be exlended lo all incorpo-
rations, and, consequently, a township, a city, a
county, or a State, and, in short, any thing tha had
a corpoiate existence, culd be embraced, but he
denied that such power existed in that body
Mr WALKER did not ntcnd to have taken
part m this discu sion, but after (he rouise which
ihis debate his taken, and atier the doctrines had
been expiessed which he had heard promulgated
during that debate, he could not abstain from some
remark The constitumnal question which was
here involved, was of the higne^t importance—it
struck at the very existene e of our mo'itutions—
and if the doctrine which had been there promul-
gated, could be su timta as the constitutional view 
of that b dy, it would be attended wit1* calamitous
consequences What was it? It was that a State,
b\ the grant of a charter to her cm/ ns, can ex-
empt them fr< m the operation of the powers grant-
ed by toe Constitution to th  United States Tnat
was the question, and it «as one of solemn import,
for if a Siate. by granting a cnarter t) any number
of h°r citizens, can exempt theri from the operation
of the powers granted to ih s Government, she can
exempt all her citizens fnm the operation of that
power And lfshpcan exempt her citizens from
ihe operation of one power of this Government,
she can exempt them fro-n the operation of
all its powers, and thereby nullify and over-
throw the Government its If I hat was the
quest on It vas that a number of individuals
of a State, by obtaining an ret of incorporation as
a bank, can override, by that legis'atire authority,
all the granted powers of this Government. And
this must be admitted to be a question of solemn
import    Power was vested m Congress to establish
a uniform system of bankruptcy, and over whom
was it to operate1 The ei'izens of every State of
the Union. And what was asked on the other
side? Why, that a certain number of citizens, by
obtaining a charter of incorporation from the State
Legislature, may rise up and exempt thenrelves
from the operation of the granted powers of this
Government He (Mr Walkek) was ready to
defend the jus* righto of the States on any occasion,
but he should not assist them in their attempt to
usurp the rights granted by the Constitution, and
by every State ot the Union, to this Government'
Tins power, then, of th  General Government,
being undeniable, he would ask whether a State
could exempt her cit zens from the operation of
this power in any mole, for if she could do it by
the grant of charters of incorporation, she could
do it in any other mode
And again, banker* wee individuals who were
engaged in trade, there were banks that were in-
corporated and banks that wsre not incorporated,
and a bankrupt law was to be passed to operate on
all the people of the Union, the powers given to
Congress were to ettab'i h a uniform system of
bankruptcy, but if the doctrine here proclaimed
were to be admitted, the law would not operate
withertire uniformity throughout the Union, as it
would be stopped on tha very threshold of those
States that thus assumed the power to exempt their
citizens from the operation of the law. Now he de •
nied that the S ates possessed any such power to
exempt their citizens from the operation of ths or
any other power vested in this Government. The
powers so vested m thi3 Government were supreme,
any thing in any State laws to the contrary not-
withs anding, and he called upon Senators to consi-
der the importance of ihe question whether any and
every State, by grantirg to all and any of her citi-
zen —for if she could exempt one she could ex-
empt all—charters of írcorporation could thus
override the powers of the General Government
Now he found there were many poweis granted by
the Constitution to this Government, and could the
States at their pleasure exempt their citizens from
the operat on of all the^e powers? Take, for in-
state, the taxing power Were corporations ex-
empted from the operation of the taxing rower of
this Government? Were individuals exempted
from it by receiving charters of mcorpoiation? If
'0, this Government ha  no taxing powei, or it is
destroyed at the will and pleasure of the States, for
they had only to cover their citizens, by a State
charter ot incorporation But who would venture
to assert that the States had such power? And was
njt the bankrupt power as clearly delegated to Con-
gress as th s taxing -power? or was one power
granted to Congress a sovereign power, and the-
other a limited power No, the bankrupt power
was just as clenil/ delegated as any other. But
again thi^ Government has the right to collect du-
ties on imports, but may not the States grant char-
ters of incorporation to wholesale importers, and
will those charters exempt them from p'yin  the
duties on their importations within the limits of the
Stale? If charters of incorporation could exempt
bankrupts from the operation of the power of this
Government, might not importing companies, by
sim lar charter*, be exempt from the operation of
tho law levying duties on impo ts Take again
the poweis of the Government to levy war Now
theyknsw that, in many Stales, there were mcor-
porited volunteer companies, and if this Govern-
ment could not apply its poweis to ihose corp«,
because they were incorporated, this Government
has no power to make war, for these chartered
eompanits were not subject to this Government.
They might take up ether cases m succession,
and tney might «trike out all the powers vested in
Congress, for th  sections of the Constitntion
conferring such powers, were but so many
dead letters if these charters were so many
exemptions from the operation of the powers
of this Government He then proceeded to
reply to the arguments of the Senator from South
Carolina [Mr Caiholn] of the previous day, and
he contended that the township commissioners, &c.
to whom that honnrabl' Senator had referred, were
but qutw corporations for the transaction of public
and not private business—that they were not be-
