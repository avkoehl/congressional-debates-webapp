new the exhaustedconditionof the Treasury, the irsufficiency
of the income of the Government, and the impropriety of going
aoy further on borrowel means This was the only way to
effect retrenchment in earnest
Mr BERRIEN desired to recall the attention of the
Senate to the consideration of the bill under discus-
sion The course which ihe debate had taken had not
been to decide upon the necessity of passing the bit!, but
upon the origin of' the conduon of the Government
requiring the loan. As a member of the Finance Committee
he had been called upon to investigate the subject thoroughly,
and he had come to the conclusion that the only question which
couldwith propriety ari=e on thisbilt, was, whether the sam
Called for was or was not absolutely nece°s¿iy— all having ad
mated that some supply was indispensable to relieve the Go
vernment from its present embarrassment
The Senate had already decided by the deliberate adoption of a
resolution, lately under discussion, that Congiess is bound to
provide means within the year for the expenditures of the
year. Under this rule, therefoie, the laiger portion of this ad
ditional loan offive millions is authorized by the circumstance
that 82,900,000 of Treasury notes not due within the year, have
been taken in through the custom houses in payment-of duties,
which should have produced money as part ol th« means of
the Government for the year He then computed the out-
standing Treasury notes, and considered the effect of the 9th
section of the act cfn the holders, with regard to funding
them; and then advertetT to the second branch of his
argument a" to the propriety of the mode of obtaining the loan
He examined the objections m detail to the several provisions of
the bill, Mist, as to the amount, second, as to the time, thud, as
to the authority to negotiate the silo of the su>ck at les-, than
par, and, fourth, as to the authority to adveitise the ¡-ale oí
stock, and having recapitulated all die arguments of those who
had preceded him, for and agam-t these r rovisions, he on
€!uded that the bill a^ it stands, is the best that could be devised
under all th^ encumatances lit, denied that he credit of the
Government wou d be impaired by the operation of thp bill,
and he contended that the object of the 1 wn being to redeem
Treasury notes, and not solely to obtain specie for them, the ef
feet would be to sustain thi* stock at pai He denied that the
effect could be to depieciate 1iea->uiy notes, because the bill
not only continues the interest on them after they fall due, but
adds a new and additional faculty to that which they aheady
possess of paying Goverrment dues—the iacultv of becoming
permanent stock if the holders j itfei t
As to the objection that this loan wo jJd hive the efftct of di
mmishing the revenue by withdi awn g that amount of capital
from commerce, thereby dimimsmng imports, he aigued that,
jf the money wis to be hoarded up, there might be some
grounds for the objection, but as the condition of the Goveinment
was obviously such a* to reqjire that the money bhall be dis
bursedas fast as it is received, it followed that there wou'd be
no such thing as a withdrawal of capital fiom the buoiness ol
the country.
And with regard to the argument that the value of the siock
would be greatly uihamed by a pledge of the public lands, ell
he should say was that he did not mean to go mtj it e merits oi
that question now, but he would avow, that if the disLibu ion
law did not exist—if the hopes and expectation of the States
had not been excited by the passage of the land bill—heshould
be opposed to the pledge oí such a vast public domain, foi a
loan of seventeen miihonsfoi twenty yeais, ui der any possible
circumstances The maj inty of Congress in both Houses., had
not only last session decided th it the proceeds of the public
lands should he disposed of by distubution, but in evety shape
and form in which the question oí its íepeal had been brought
up tins session, the wilt of the majonty in Congiess had decided
that the land fund s' ould not be restored 10 the Tieasuiy as a
source of revenue But the gentlemen opposite say the fund
■must come back What is this but a decision that the wi'l of
the minority shall contiol the will of the majority Much
had been said on the subject of the clause in the dif-tubution
act to restore the land fund to the public Treiemy in the event
of violating the compromise act He conceived a gieat eiroi
prevailed in supposing the whole force of that clause rested on
the simple fact that the tariff shou'd be íai&ed past twenty per
cent Now, he a ked, bow could that contingency alone give
efficacy to the clause, when H leaches a!-o to eveiy o het pro

0dO, besides postponed appropuaiions which, li adled, would
show that a very laige poition of the seventeen million debt
charged upon the present idminishafion, was incuned b> the
late Administration He insisted that the innea&ed revenue
authouzed by the tat lit bill of the extra ^ea-iin moie thin
counterbalanced the expendituies authouzed by the e\tia scs
sion
In conclusion he stated that his conviction was in favor of
this bill, because he conceived it was ansolutely nece&saiy to
relieve the Govern nent fro in embanas&meot
Mr MANGUM observed that he had been ip doubt for ^e
veral days whethei he could go foi this bill without*! |1 dffc
that no ultenor decsion was looked to, for rtbtoid ion ofti e
landfund But the indicia m^! ¿ had now wunesstd inline
arguments of the Senatoi from Geoigia,had satisfied hmuhat he
could with sifetv vote wi h hio friends feu  1  & bill
Mr SEVIER di i t it intend ti discirsci ¡e i m« which had
been so ably di«cuss dbvtho ewlm pieceeded him fiutnero&e
to say a f*w woid-, n defence of the Pre^i lent of the TTmred
States H-> had been leaded m unmeasured te-ms fn his\e
toes on the bank bills of the ex la session—m which he ha 1 ict
ed with a consistency andpa'notism whrh it would b° well if
those who now condemn him had imitated He en tin oiated
the instances in which the leadeit, of the Whtgptrty had b^en
themselve^guilty of the grossest inconsistency on the bank q. i s
íioh, and on the other question ot their own policy, and allied
them how conid they with consistency chai ge the Prest lent of
the Tinted States with inconsistency, because he would not
give up the punciples to which he had adhered throughout
his political lifei
Mr S here alluded to a passage m Mr Archer's speech,
stating the manner m which the President had treated a depu-
tation of the Whig party who waited on him during the extra
session and weie described as bending the supple knee to Exe
cutive power, with tears m their eyes, beseeching him to give
them a Bank bill The President was accused of having
spumed them and their bill And what struck him with asto
mshment was, that among this deputation weie a distinguished
member of the other House, [Mr Sergeant ] a former Attor
ney Geneial to Andrew Jackson, and one or two distinguished
Senators—all bending the supple knee at the ioot of Executive
po.ver And weie not these the very men who themselves had
over and over accused the Democratic party with subserviency
to Executive power?
He was astonished to hear the new point broached by the
Senater from Georgia, [Mr Berrien ] that the 20 per cent of
the compromise act was not the only contingency on which 'he
lestoration of the land fund rested And with regard to this,
the frankness and fairness with which the President of the
United States had come out m support of the true version of
that clause, as understood by eveiy one who voted on the mea
sure, merited the highest praise For this frankness and fair-
ness he honored him
His reason for voting against this bill was, first, that he would
not trust the party in powei with so much money—that is, he
would ngt confide so much in their wisdom, economy, or, in
other words, political honesty In thesecond place, he objected
to the terms of the b'lll The Whigparty have broughtiht cre-
dit of the Government to itspiesetit deplorable condition, and
it was asking too much of him, in view of their conduct, to ask
him to vote fora bill to authorize the stock ol the Government
to be-so'd for whatever it would bring lie would not vote oi
anv bill which would authorize the stock to be sold lor Jefis
than dollar for dollar
Anothei reason why he would not vote for it wai that it au
thnnzedsuip to be out out even as low as five dollar, and
thereby make another continental papei bank for Goveinn etit
Could any one be blamed for changing the Whigs with pioihgacy
and wastefulness, m having squandered away iwenty two mil-
lions in so short a penod ¿s since they came into powei? He
had heaid the beriator fiom Illinois [Mi Yc uis(?3 and the Sena
tor fiom Alabama [Mr King] recite their c\peuences in
Wall stteet He, too, would mention tin result of hisexnenonce
He had spent a couple of months in New York in 1837, nego
uating the sate of some of the «lock of his State, and after wait
ing&ome hitvdays for bid" which hene/ercoukl get up to his
standard-^Tnollar foi dollar, he was on the point ol starting loi
Euiope, and having told thebroKeis so, the very evening before
the day of hi* passage he received a bidot d >lUr foi diilai foi
his stock And such, he contended, would be the effect of ma Ic-
ing it a sine quanonot tha loan, that doilai foi dollar should
be had for the stock, let what ínterest might be neces ary be
paid
Tne Whig pirty was divided upon most of the measures
which they called their bystem of meabUie-s Some of the gen
tlcmen opposi e had insisted that the bank question was not a
WhigmeiMne some that the distribution wai nota Whig mea*
sme, some thit the bi ikiu11 law was nota W hijr measnie, but
now t! ey all i*m e on this bill for one great Whig principie—
debt loan and taxes
Mr BLRRU.N old not ln'end to reenmina'e He did not
understand thit the Seuatoi from Aik insta give his authority
for what he had said with regard to the Whig deputation
There is no foundation in truth lorthe story that himself and
Mi Sergeautsupphcated the Piesident with teaib in their eyes
and with supphantand bended knee, to sign the bank bill Whit
tWey did say to the Piesident was, that they came to him re
spectfully toaskif theie was any common ground on which
they could unite, intimating that nothing he should idvii=e
would be considered as dictation, but would bs respectfully
considered, and if not appioved, would be rejected He further
explained the natureof themtcmews with the Piesident.

V ma paity v. is to bring d)wn destn ctton on the conn ry oi
to involve him and his posterity in calamities sucha;, he de
I^seemedtohim hat hey might debate on the iffdir  ofthe
Gjveiiiinent without ¡=o much asperity He, for one, was
wliincfl hathw responsibility should beall that it ought to be,
hu' that the Whig paity had not the control of the Govern-
ment, was known to every gentleman m this body> and in
furnefs a greater share of responsibility than that of their
own functions  bhould not be thrown upon them, whatever
of ]nst responsibility rests upon the Whig party they
are willing to take There was no man more willing to retrench
andrefoim than himseli—and such was al30 the case with re-
gard to his friends. They were willing to taken counsel froiri
the gentlemen themselves, and he implored them not to sup-
pose that it wasthen intention to fill the hands of the Govern-
ment with money to squander m extravagance How could the
Senator from Arkansas, after having cast an imputation on th©
Whig partvof opposing and abusing the President, suppose
they were animus to place in his hands the means of wasteful
ex pendí tme^ He would rote for this bilt, hut he would do so
with piefound reluctance He voted for it under the sense of
obligation which impelled him to act from pubheduty
It seemed to him that the allusion made by the Senator from
Arkansas to the relationsof the Whig party with the President
of the United States, were unkind and ungenerous Heshould
not be drawn into any statement on that head He would take
his own time and oocasion to adveit to such matters, should it
ever be necessary for him to do so The explanation made by
the Senator from Georgia he considered called for, however
much it was to be regietied that any eentleman should be
drawn into personal explanations, which delicacy would sug-
gest ought to be left to himself to choose time and* occasion Jor
making He had hoped a time had come—a marvetíous time—
when the two great contending partes might meet on ofta
commoaplatfoim and reason together.
Mr SEVIER desired to say a few wordsin reply to the Sena'or
from Kentucky He supposed the Senatoi had not heard hia
observations, or most of his speech would have been spared.
What he ha 1 said was that one part of the party denied thac
the Kink bill was a Whist measure, another the land bill, ano-
ther the banlviupt bill, but heie they were all united on this
bill for debt, loan, and taxes
Was it to be expected that he md his ft lends were to sit front
mornmst to nisfht livening to abuse of themselves and their par-
ty and be vilified, with padlocks on their mouths? What sort of
fair play was therein contrastingthebestoftlro Whisrmeasurfs
with the woist-of their opponents'* If gentlemen gave blows
thev shoulde-^pf tt to leceive blows?
He had defended the Piesident for hi=i vtto and his message,
and not with a ntw of assailing the Whig paity
Mi I INN observed thit theie was so much of good 'empec
and good feeling in the remarks made by the Senator from
Kentucky, that he should not have felt himself justified m
rioioir to prolong the di^cubsion if he was not in some sort ui -
der the necessity of asking the Senator if it wag to him he al-
luded is hating made paity remark* yesterday, and if m these
lemaikshe conceived any thing peieonalto him was contained'?
He could assure him no such thing was intended, and if there
was any thing m what he ha I said that could beat such meaning,
hewuhdiew it must cheeiíulíy His intention had been mere-
ly to show the discordant elements of the Whig party, and ta
show th t it had been predicted thry could not hold together
lie refened to the fiequent occasions on which the party to
which he belonged had been designated as plunderers and land
puates Gentlemen themselves go back and rake up the past,
and the Democratic paity is compelled in self defence £o go
back also, and admonish the pai y now in potvrby rermndiQg
them of the past too
He was awaiethat cumina'ion and lemmmaiion were mis-
placed in the Sena e of the United states He felt that the time
wis come when all should forget what he was peiíecüy will-
ing fo forget
Mi CRUTCINDEN explained, that what he had said with
icgaidto responsibility, was rhat h" would do for the present
Adnnntstiation all that was proper and necessary for him to do 
but further than that, he renounced all responsibility for the
acts of this Admimstiation
Mr KIISGobseived thatthe time wascome when it wai de-
sirable that all, without distinction of party, should make such
arrangements as would enable the Government to perform its
duties, arid su^nio the honor and credit of the country He,
therefore could not say with the Senatoi s from Ninth Carolina,
[Mi MangumI fiotfl Geoisra [Mi IÍekhien] and from Ken-
tucky, [Mi Crittenden] that he would vote for thrs bill
wiih regiet, for hiMegret was th tt he could not vote for the
bill líe n gi etted that such modifications were not made in it
as wuuid hdve enabkd lam inue foi the loan
He decned the ai eminent that no ilteration oughtfo he mada
tothwbid, which would not be acceptaile to the other Home.
The derate was bound to do its dutvwihout regard to the ef-
fect w h ch the exercise of thit duty \ ould have t isewhere
