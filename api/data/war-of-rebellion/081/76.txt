IN THE FILED, June 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

General Grant directs that the obstructions be sunk, at such a point as will be under cover of our guns, by us. I inclose his note* on that subject. I have directed two tugs, with twenty-five men, for that purpose to be opposite the iron-clads in the James at 12 o'clock to-day. I also inclose a note+ to Admiral Lee on that subject, which you will deliver to him, but consult with him as to the best place to sink the obstructions. If he fails to point out a place use your own judgment, but you will observe that they are to be protected by our guns. If it is necessary to communicate with me on this subject I shall be near the signal station on the left of the line, and you can signal me there from the right.

Respectfully,

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, June 15, 1864-2.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel MORGAN:

You will send 60,000 rations to General Hancock's corps at Wind-Mill Point. Colonel Fuller will furnish transportation. If any rations are afloat they may at once be towed down. Great promptness is required.

By command of Major-General Butler:

FRED. MARTIN,

Captain and Commissary of Musters.

JUNE 15, 1864-8 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel FULLER:

At 12 m. to-day you will have in the river, opposite the iron-clads, two strong tugs, with Mr. Ainsworth and a gang of twenty-five of the men best adapted to handling vessels, to report there to the engineer officer, whom you will find on the bank near the ravine.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

BERMUDA, June 15, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

Will send Ainsworth and the tugs up the James as requested at 12 m. to-day, although it will take all the tugs we have here. Ainsworth is up the Appomattox. Can you send word to him at the wharf there to return here immediately?

C. E. FULLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.
