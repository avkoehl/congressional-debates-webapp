MOUTH OF WHITE RIVER, September 22, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

GENERAL: The Seventh Missouri Volunteers has been consolidated into three companies. One company is at this place; the other two companies are, I am informed, at Memphis. You will oblige me by ordering them to join the Second Division, Nineteenth Army Corps, at mouth of White River. If these two companies are not at Memphis I will be much obliged to you for any information in your possession with reference to them. Have just returned from Little Rock. All quiet in that vicinity. General Mower had moved toward Jacksonport; had not been heard from yesterday at Devall's Bluff. Please address to New Orleans, La.

Very respectfully,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 22, 1864.

Admiral PORTER,

Cairo:

It is probable we shall have a formidable invasion of Missouri, and as Girardeau is exposed, and as we have not force to garrison it very strongly, would ask you, if possible, to send up one or two light-draught gun-boats to cruise in its vicinity till evens show they are not needed.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

MOUND CITY, September 22, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

A light-draught gun-boats leaves here to-morrow for Girardeau to cruise in that vicinity. Please keep me posted in regard to rebel movements.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Captain, Commanding Station.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, September 22, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

If you start Colonel Ford I will send him south, as I am sending all my available fractions forward to be ready for giving Price the best show I can. Governor Carney has called out the militia. We must not only defend our departments, but to try to aid in opening the way to comrades now on the Arkansas River.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 22, 1864.

Major General ALFRED PLEASONTON,
