to leave Willcox's front, I send you a dispatch* I received from him last night. I hope to report very soon the condition of Potter's front with more certainty.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 6, 1864-10.45 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Please report your judgment on the practicability, as far as you are now able to judge, of an assault on the enemy's works in your immediate front, and make such examination as will enable you to form an opinion.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 6, 1864-12 m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

Reports received from Major-General Smith indicate that you have withdrawn from the position you held on his right. This may be a misapprehension, since your report of this morning showed that your position on Smith's right was held by two divisions of your corps, the third holding to Bosher's. This, the major-general commanding directs me to say, was in accordance with his directions. The withdrawal from Smith's right wouldn't be, in is contrary to his orders.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 6, 1864-1 p.m. (Received 1.45 p.m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 12 o'clock is received. I have just returned from my lines with General Birney. They are the same as indicated in my report of this morning. I have not withdrawn a single man from the two divisions on the right of General Smith. Generals Willcox and Potter remain as they were, except that two regiments of General Potter's division have been swung a little to the right in accordance with your order.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
