Major-General.

DABNEY'S MILL,

April 1, 1865-9.50 p.m. (Received 10 p.m.)

General MEADE:

Your dispatch to corps commanders received.* I did not mean that attack should be made without forming assaulting columns, but that batteries should open on receipt of orders. They can feel out with skirmishers and sharpshooters if the enemy is leaving, and attack in their own way.

Your dispatch of 9.30 has been sent to General Humphreys. At what time would you like the Second Corps to follow Miles to join Sheridan? For if this movement is made it will be necessary to remove the hospitals and wagon train to the other side of Hatcher's Run.
