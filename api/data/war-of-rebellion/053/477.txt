Bear Creek. To-morrow morning you will move toward Tuscumbia and encamp on Cane Creek. The Second Division will close up with you on the march to-morrow, and in order that it may do so you will march slowly. I ordered up the Fifth Ohio Cavalry to report to you

to-day. As soon as the Third Regiment Cavalry comes up I will order them to report to you also. Keep your cavalry well out in the advance on the march.

WAR DEPARTMENT, October 19, 1863-9 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

There has been no battle recently at Bull Run. I suppose what you have heard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an "affair" at Bristoe Station, on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction, toward the Rappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th. It began by an attack of the enemy upon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of four cannon and from 400 to 700 prisoners.

WASHINGTON, October 19, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

General Burnside telegraphs on the 17th that he has a cavalry brigade at Post Oak Springs, with pickets extending to your left, and another cavalry brigade on south side of the river, picketing down to the Hiwassee. Your armies are, therefore, in communication, and should be able to co-operate at any moment against the enemy.
