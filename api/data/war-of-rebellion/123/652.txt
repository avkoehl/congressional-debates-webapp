Brigadier-General BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

We have about 5,000 French rifles, about 4,000 of which may be made serviceable (though would prefer not to issue them if others can be got), and 1,000 Enfields. these are all the arms we have. We will have 15,000 men, drafted and volunteers. It is difficult to say how many of each, as the drafted men are rapidly enlisting. We want the arms immediately.

GEO. B. WRIGHT,

Quartermaster-General of Ohio.
