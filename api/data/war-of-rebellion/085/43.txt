Third. The infantry picket on the top of the hill by the brick house south of the penitentiary to be moved farther out beyond the springs, and into the slope of the hill below the camp of Ninth Kansas Cavalry, on the south side of the road. The general commanding also directs that you designate the infantry which shall man the rifle-pits on the west side of town in case of need, and such orders given that in an emergency there shall be no delay in occupying the works effectively. Also that the One hundred and twelfth and One hundred and thirteenth U. S. Colored Infantry move camp to the vicinity of the unfinished earth-works near the river, north of the penitentiary, to be used as a support to Marr's battery and to the Third Kansas Battery, which will be ordered into position on the hill by the fortification referred to, so as to command the approach through the west valleys.

Major JAMES F. DWIGHT,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: Your instructions in reference to the pickets have been complied with. The One hundred and twelfth and One hundred and thirteenth U. S. Colored Infantry have been ordered to move their camps as directed. I suggest that the commander of the post be instructed to man the rifle-pits on the west side of town. I have not force not force enough to guard the whole line, and as the post troops are camped on the west side of town they can be more speedily got in position. The infantry of Colonel Salomon's brigade will man the works from Fort Steele to the river east of town.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CYRUS BUSSEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., September 3, 1864.

Brigadier General CYRUS, BUSSEY,

Commanding First Division, Seventh Army Corps:

GENERAL: In answer to your suggestion that the post troops man the rifle-pits west of the town, the brigadier-general commanding directs me to say that he does not consider it expedient on account of the scattered condition of the post troops to rely upon them for such service. The general suggests that a regiment take up camp near the two earthworks northwest of Fort Steele, and be assigned to the special duty of manning the two rifle-pits there and of protecting the penitentiary, while the colored troops protect the works nearer the river. Instructions will be given the Ninth Kansas Cavalry, now encamped on the hill south of the penitentiary, to form on front in the trenches near their camp, in case of emergency and in default of other orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES F. DWIGHT,

Major and Chief of Staff.
