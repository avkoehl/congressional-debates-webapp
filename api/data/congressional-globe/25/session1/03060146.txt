tic, disinterested 01 salutary counsel from the
«ource whesce the petitions ard demands for a
national bank proceed Do we find the patriot c,
the clear-headed and honest hearted yeomanrv and
mechanics of the country clamoring for a national
bank? No, sir No—the productive and laboring
classes appeciate their political welfare too highly,
to desire such an institution The great majority
of bank advoca es are to be found among the non-
producers—the tiafficVers and speculators of the
country—chi'dren"of Softy hopes and low desires"
most of whom are peculiarly affected by the pre-
sent pressure of the time* And would it be the
part of wisdom to give heed to counsel emana-
ting from such sources1 Can it be reasonably ex-
pected, that men relyirg solely upon bank facili-
ties.—men suddenly disappointed m their high ex-
pectations of immediate wealth and consequent
influence, would be the most competent to direct
thp action oí Government and control the des-
tinies of the nation, at such a conjuncture1 No,
sir—their habits 01 life—of thinking—their pe-
culiar situation—the circumstances which influ-
ence their judgments, and impel them to action—
ail—all conspire to disqualify them f&r the task
We know, sir, that it is more natural for men in
affliction—whether phjsical or political—to have
recourse to palliatives-— to immediate and temporary
expedients, than to deliberate on the means neces-
saiv to secure ptimanenl relief
REMARKS OF MR. CAMBRELENG,
Ot Ntw York,
In the Home of Reprrsentalwes, October  13, 1837—
On the bill imposing additional duties on public
officers, as depositories of the public money, and
requiring thepajment of the revenue in specie,
or evidences of public debt
Mr CAMBRELENG said that an apology was
certainly due to the members of the committee for
thiowing himself upon their indulgence at so late
an hour, norn out as the; all were by daily and
nightly sessions He had hitherto abstimed irom
debate, anxiously desiring the early passage of the
important measures reported, and he should not
now have addressed the committee, but for the
strange charaiter of the proceedings of the House
dining the present session, callsd, as it was, under
extraordnaiy cirsumstatic s The banks had sus-
pended specte payments , the Government, with a
surplus of forU-two millions and a half, found its
Treasury embarrassed, and there was every reason
to expect that it would soon be without means to
meet its current expenditures Trade was also pa-
ralysed, by a revulsion more \iolent than any that
had hithei to checked the onward course of the pros-
perity ot this country
CaUed together, Mr Chairman, und"r such cir-
cumstances, I had supposed that whatever might
be oui opinions oí past events, or ol our mutual
errors, we should come here prepared, without
regard to party, to provide i common remedy for
a common calamity I had thought that we should
be unanimously disposed to relieve our Treasury
from its embarrassment, m a mode calculated to aid
most extensively m giving renewed activity to
our internal cnculations, and in reviving trade
Judge then, of my surprise to see every measure
recommended by the President not only opposed,
but its passage retarded by every movement
that cou'd embanass the pioceedwgs of this
House So far from aiding us in our measures,
the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr Cushmg)
told i s thai lie vt ould not " ra se his finger to relieve
the Treasury irom its embarrassments " (Mr
Cushmg explainu. ) i am hpppy, sn,that the
gentleman is penitent 1 understood him as the
repoiters di I, (Mr C siid his remark had not
been coirectlv reported ) But the gentleman from
Kentucky, (Mr Menefee) a fentleman who from
his d,ebut here promises to be an ornament to this
House, indeed he is already so—that gentleman
went further still, and rejoiced at the embarrass-
ments of Ojjr Tie,asujy
Th<- spirit of party must be violent indeed, when
it ma íes war upon the Treasury of our own Go-
vernment, instituted for the common benefit    Had
gentlemen come forward, as the country expected
they would do; had they united with us, and passed
our bills a month ago, they would have afforded
immediate and general relief to every part of the
Union Instead of that, what have we seen1 Op-
position to every measure of relief When we
proposed to i eheve the Treasury from its engage-
ment to deposite nine millions with the States, we
were told or the millions due from the merchants
and the banks The bonds were not to be nost-
poned to relieve our debtors from the necessity of
purchasing specie at a premium, and to aid the
banks in an early resumption of specie pavments
Our southwestern banks were to be cabed upon
to pay their balances, by distressing their debtors,
and at a ensis when specie in that part of the Union
was at twenty, thutv, and forty per cent premium
All this was to be done, at a moment when trade
was paralysed, and credit destroyed, ror the purpose
of depositing nine millions wuh the Slates' The
issue of ten millions of Treasury notes too—a
measure calculated to give general relief m the
present condition of our internal exchanges and
circulation—that measuie was resisted The in-
terests of the Treasur), and of the country, were
to be set aside, in ordu to furnish a stock to our
capitalists, or to enable the Bank of the United
States to purchase its bonds at its own price' And |
now, when it is proposed to separate the Treasury
from the banking institutions of the country,
to dissolve that fatal union which has contributed
so largely to disturb their operations, and to shatter
the fortunes of trade, a proposition is made to re-
unite them by stronger bonds, and to perpetuate
their mutual embarrassments
Relief has not been the order of the day v. ith
gentlemen, They had no measure to propose to
calm the agitations of trade, to revive confidence,
and to give a new impulse to the prosperity of the
country Their movements were of another cha-
racter Agitation was the order of the day, and,
at the moment when the country anticipated prompt
relief, we have found ourselves m the midst of
another panic session Thegertleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr Seigeant) ha> told us of "the awful
winter" approaching, and we have heard irom all
quarters the old war-cry of a national bank or a
revolution The removal oí the deposites, the
specie cucular, and all the stale subjects of debate
f r five years past, have been revived Prepara-
tion is evidently made tor a third campaign for a
Bank of the United States—that sovereign remedy
foi all the calamities brought upon the country by
the mal administration of oui late President
Sir, although thes  subjects are stale, it is useful
to consi ler ihem at a time when we may justly ap-
pieciate them, and in connection with the mauiry
into the causes of the recent revulsion and the ge-
neral suspension of specie payments As to the
specie cucular, I shall soon dismiss that What
was its operaUon1 It increased the specie in the
western deposite bank , in thirteen months, some
three millions and a half And whence was this
amount drawn1 Prom the ports on the Atlantic
and the Gulf, into which there were at the same
time flowing moie than ten millions of com and
bul'ion be3 0iid the amount expoited Was the
deposite in the western banks special1 No ever)
dollar of it might have been returned It might
have been drawn by the banks on the Atlantic and
the Gulf, an I would have been diawn, had they
not been, at the same time, receiving three times
the amount from abioad Such, sir, is the whole
currency operation of the specie circular—that
measuie which stems, in the estimation of gentle-
men, to have been the terrible author of all the ca-
lamities of the commercial world According to
their argument, it followed the swift current of the ,
Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans, and swept
away the most eminent houses m that ci*y It took
the couise of the Gulf Stream, and gave a shock to
every citj on the Atlantic It prostrated mce than
a hundied of the most enterprising merchants of
New York, crossed the Atlantic, shook the rojal
exchange, and continued its disastrous course |
throughout all Europe But, sir, the most remark-
able performance of this uemendous measure we
did not hear of for some months after it wa¿> issued
Before it visited the two continents on our side, it
actually passed through the globe, and produced an
earthquake in the Celestial Empire In this revul-
sion, the Hong merchant was the first victim    Mr
Chairman, the question is unworthy of argument__
it is fit only for ridicule 1 was glad to hear the
learned and travelled gentleman from South Caro-
lina (Mr Legale) who\ddressed the Committee
this morning, do jusace to the specie circular, and
admit that but for that, Heaven knows " where we
should have gone " Sir, if that specie circular, and
the London bankers' circular—a measure ill tmied,
sudden, and overwhelming—if both these circulars
had been issued twelve months earlier, it would
have saved, on both sides of the Atlantic, many a
merchant from bankruptcy, and thousands of fami-
lies from poverty and want
Equally unsubstantial is the charge against ths
late administration for drawing specie from Eu-
rope. If gentlemen would reflect upon the opera-
tion of the measures of Congress and of Parliament,
adopted upon no party grounds, ana upon the effect
of a constant influx of capital fn m the old to the
new world, they would find no difficulty in account-
ing for our heavy importations of specie for some
years past They will find the foundation laid by
the act of Parliament of 183^, and our com law of
1834 The former made Bank of England notesja
lawful tendel, d spensed, in some measure, with the
use for gold, and encouraged its exportation, w bile
the latter raised the price ot gold above the Eu-
ropean standard, and facilitated its importation into
this countr} The act of 1834 was the first mea-
sure ever adopted by us calculated to fortify the
bisis of our commercial credit, and to secure a jurt
portion of the metallic cunericy of the world Had
the Bank ot England not suspended specie pay-
ments for twenty five years, we should long since
have discovered and corrected the error m our com
laws Had we revised them forty j e irs ago, the
trade of tms country would have restpd on a more
stable foundation than it now does For years we
w ere mere traders in currency We drew it from the
islands and countries south of us and exported our
silver to China and our gold clueflv to Europe,
evenafterthe expense of coming We have latterly
exported little to Clima, less than three millions
in five years, and the course of trade, and the ope-
ration of the "om laws of England, France, aid
this country, do not authorize us to anticipate its
steady exportation as heretofore In the last fifteen
years we have imported abcut eighty-seven mil-
lions fiom the countries and islands south of us,
and there is always a current of com and bullion
setting m from that direction There will be no
difficulty now in securing a substantial basis for
trade, if our State Legislatures do not banish specie
from the country, and if we separate our revenue
from our bank note circulations
If we would ascertain the causes of the recent re-
vulsion, we should be obliged to go back to a very
ancient date The gentleman from Pennsjlvama
(Mr Sergeant) has truly told us that all countries
are liable to revulsions, whatever be the character
of their currency When credit is abused, an ex-
plosion must follow, and credit has been sometimes
abused excessively, even m countries with a metal-
lic cnrrenc} But, sir, the gentleman was obliged
to go back a century for the explosion in Prance,
and that explosion was an affair of the King, who,
in December, 1718, took Law's bank into his own
hands Wherever Governments peirmt paper to
be substituted for the precious metals, revuNons
must become an every day affair, and their vio-
lence is also very much increased by mercantile
notes and bills, issued in exchange for credit, the
whole of which explodes at every revulsion, and
steadily increases the amount of bankiuptcy The
rapid growth of thi country, and the bold and en-
terprising character of our trade, render us more
liable than other countries to frequent and violent
revulsions
But, sir, all these cat ses combined, have never
before produced a general suspension of specie pay-
ments, in tune of peace, m any country We must
seek for other causes for an event so extraordinary
It is possible that the circular of the London bank-
ers, issued, we may say, by order of the Bank of
England, and coming suddenly upon the trading
