CUMBERLAND  ROAD
REMARKS OF ~MR  RARIDEN,
Oí   I\D.ANA,
hi the Hoiks of Representatives, Jlp il 12, 1838—
The " bill making appropriations for the conti-
nuation ol th° Cumberland Road through Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois," being under considera-
tion—
The question pending was the motion of Mr.
Underwood of Kentucky, to recommit the bill to
the Committee of Way  and Means, with instruc-
tions to report, in lieu thereof, a bill to provide for
the surrender of said road to the States through
w hich it passes
Mr RARIDEN rose and said, that living in,
and representing, a district of country through
which this great national work passed, he must na-
turally be supposed fo feel a very deep interest m
every thing which was done or said in this House
in relation to if, and he hoped his situation and
feelings would be a sufficient apology for the time
he might occupy in giving the House his views
upon it He regretted exceedingly that the propo-
sition to recommit the bill, with the proposed in-
structions, had been made, and especially from the
quarter whence it came, and that regret was by no
means diminished by the avowal of the gentle-
man, that his proposition was retaliatory. Sir,
asked Mr R could not the gentleman have «ought
out measures of this Administration less, identified
with his political friends and himself as a Western
man, to wreak his resentment upon, and have
saved his. friends, and a measure much endeared to
many of them' Mr R thought he could, and he
did hope the genlleman would reconsider, and that
what vengeance he had in store for the baffiedhopes
of the Portland Canal, might fall upon theheadsand
measures of his opponents, and of the opponents
of this favorita measure of Kentucky
Mr R proposed to go into a very brief account
of the origin of that great national thoroughfare,
and the considerations which the supposed governed
the thoughts of those w ho then controlled the desti-
nies cr this great Republic, m regard to it It
should be borne in mind, said he, that, m 1803,
the United States had acquired Louisiana, a great
cotton growing country It was then compara-
t ve!> a wilderness, so was the entire region west
of the Ohio river Each might be made capable
of producing, and be made auxiliary to each other,
and to the whole nation, m producing products for
foreign markets, as well as domestic consumption,
bv the adoption of a liberal and enlightened policy
towards them, and it became very important, in
bringing about this end, to adoptisuch a course as
v ould facilitate emigration and people those coun-
tries This could be done only by opening a way,
and by creating facilities of commerce and inter-
communication between the emigrant and his father-
land This road was the expedient wisely hit upon
to produce this result By an act of Congress of
1806 sanct oned by Mr Jefferson and his Demo-
ci atic friends, provision was made for its survey
from Cumberland to Wheeling, and this, too, at a
time «hen the Revolutionary debt and the Louisia
na debt was upon us, and out revenue very mcon-
 i lerable
We1! su, we went on from vear to year, after
t^e road had been commenced in 1810, till the
piestnt time, while the coun'ry was. undergoing
every vicisitude of fortune, peace and war, of
«car^itv and plenty Yet at all times, and under
every Administration, and every party which has
held the íeigns of power, this work has gradually
proeressed, and been considered of national im-
portance It has long since been finished to
Wheeling The way thus opened, and the facili-
ties thus created, had the desired effect The
Western wilds became peopled witn an industrious
and enterprising population, its wilderness was
converted into fruitful fields, and lhe avails of its
mdust y were visible throughout the nation The
public lands for which a market had been created
bv Western enterprise, found their wav nto the
Nat onal Tieasury, and from thence into light-
houses, breakwater^, harbors, navy yards, &c &c
This is not all sir By this policv the West had
become, as had been predicted by the ptojectors
of this work, tne fountain of Southern subsistence
he whole fo^ce of the Lower Mississ ppi
val ey was directed to the production of cotton,
that great staple and mlet of national wealth
The West made the bread and meat which en-
teied into its production, and the South finished the
process, and paid us our portion    This, sir, said
Mr R. is what he Supposed was in the contempla-
tion of the patriots who projected this road to brmg
about How their anticipations have been realized,
and more than realized, let the present condition of
the West and the Southwest bear witness. Let the
unparalleled increase of Western and Southern pro-
duction, and their effect upon the national income,
speak for the wisdom of our fathers upon this mea-
suie Well, sir, in 1818 the United States had ac-
quired the lands through which this road would
pass, through Indiana and Illinois, to the bank of
the Mississippi, nearly the whole route, and in.
1819 also had made a very large augmentation to
its cotton-growing land, by the acquisition of East
and West Plonda. These two considerations in-
duced the Government to extend the survey^of the
read from Wheeling, through the seats of Govern-
ment of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to the left bank
of the Mississippi, and to make appropriations to
commence its construction in Ohio, looking to that
point on the Mississippi When this was done, the
lands in its vicinity, in those States, the mam
part of which were owned by the Government,
were much «ought after from the enhanced value
which their proximity to this thoronghfarp gave
them they were all bought up. Lands which had
little or no other value than their connection with
the road, and which, without it, would have re-
mained unoccupied and unbought for fifty years to
come, were purchased and repurchased at enhanced
pnces. During this time, while the sales of Govern-
ment lands was going on the road was going on
Every year you gave it its accustomed appropria-
tion, as if the Government really intended its con-
struction without a word of opposition, save the
fashionable, stereotyped, constitutional objections
which a few always professed to hold The States
through which it passed had no choice or agency in
its location They had to adjust and conform their
State roads and other works te it as the great
column of internal communication, plantations
were adjusted to it, houses and towns sprang up
like magic, and property rose to a value com-
mensurate with the brilliant destmv of a country
through which a wise and munificent Govern-
ment had projected this monument of its justice
and wisdom, and evidence of its parental regard
The process did not end here. The Government
receipts did not end with the exhaustion of the
lands upon tSie margin of the road No, sir
The road only became the base of settlements,
which extended nortV and south, till they absorbed
the greater portion of the Government lands And
in this manner, and by this stimulant, were those
lands converted into money, and the money appro-
priated to the use of the nation The Western
people do not complain that thev had to pay for
those lands, but that in the selection of ho-nes for
their families for life, their locations were de-
termined bv the just expectations created by the
action of the Government in regard to the con-
veniences and facilities in prospec Thev sup-
posed its action to be in good futh, with a v lew to
the consummation of the object indicated bj i'„
action, and they accordingly selected their homes
And now, sir, are they to be at tins late day toU,
that the Government is not committed to this
great work i Mr R said he would not dis„us,j
the power of the Government to commence and
prosecute it If thirty years' action—it the sai uio i
of Jefferson, Madron, Monroe, Adams, ard Ja< -
son, and their adv ísers—if the uni urm. itaisireive
sanction of fifteen successive Congre se haj n
placed the power out of controversy m in  mill's
of some gentlemen, he confessed he ae^paaert il
doing it
But some gentlemen tell us that thtv  } <= i    u -
pouer to Congress, but consider it me\pedien , a
this time, to make an appropriation on accoui t i'
the poverty of the Treasury     He would sav <i
word as to the  acts by  which he consideicl   the.
Government committed to the States  and the citi
zens of the States through w hich th^ road passes,
to its completion, saymg nothing of tl e ongi ia
compact with the new  States     The good iaith
ei a Government is more than a bond although
there is no legal power of coercion to the fu fin nt
of-the just hopes cieated bv its acN, jet thei  i   •>
moral power acting upon its agents, deemed bv ili
