Ormsby, who deserted from Second Massachusetts Cavalry on the night of January 24, was captured, and is now being tried by drumhead court-martial. * Two men of the Second Massachusetts Cavalry and 3 rebels were wounded. Five citizens were arrested under suspicious circumstances. No evidence was found of any five being in the vicinity.
