25th Cong-- 2xd Sü,¡>í>.             ______________Public Printing—Mr. Dromgoole._________________________________H. of Reps.
[Here Mr. Mt-Rcta rose and reminded his col-
league that, in íeíerence to the printing of Jeffer-
son's Manual, that «oik had been made a part of
the rules oí the House, where it did not conflict
with them ]
Mr Dromgoole was fully aware of that
fact He believed that his colleague was
chauman of the committee that reported the
revised rules at the extra session, includ-
ing the order foi the adoption ot Jefferson's
Manual as a part ot them, and it was upon
that gentleman's motion, in the first instance, and
a subsequent motion of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr Adams,] who sits near me, that the
printing ot a large edition of the work wai. directed.
it was certainly with no uewot attaching blame to
any one, that he sought for tin? m formation Tt
was for the purpose oí avoiding a repetition of the
expenditure The matter had presented itself to
his consideration, and he thought it not an impro-
per subject for the attention oi the ptoposed com-
mittee
In what he had proposed, said Mr D he had no
design of precluding hi  honorable colleague, the
mover of the resolution, from going into the most
lull and ample investigation of all other topics
deemed to com  within its scope His colleigue
proposed, he believed, to provide, iiy taw, for pre-
venting the emplo\ment of an) conductor oí a po-
litical journal in the execution of the public print-
ing Whethei he should ultimalely concui with
his honorable colleague [Mr Hopkins] ill that ob-
ject, hi could not then say He would hear the
leasons ior it, w eigh them dispassionately, and be
governed by his best convictions of duty It would
lake, howevei, vciy strongíeasons indeed to induce
him to vote for a law, pioscribmg, in advance, any
individual 01 class of individuals from being employ-
ed in the pub'ic service If it was wiong to elect
the con tnetoi of a political journal to do the jublic
jinnting, in the estimation of a majority oí the
House, ii it had, on account of the patronage 'be-
stowed, a corrupting effect, let them decline to elect
an editor, and select á practical, piofessional prin-
ter According to the present impressions oi his
mind, he was not disposed to pas-* a piosonptive
law
Mr D said, sire!) he hi 1 no inclination to
Wane the /< al ot his lunoiablc lolhajjue, [All
Hopkins] who moved the ongiml «solution, lor
desiring to willihoi all the patron?ge of Govern
ment from political jouinils It would be recol-
lected that a «hort time befoie a colleague of theirs
[Mr Panon, I vacated h s seat, he had, under (he
dnection of the Librar) Committee moved for a
very hrge subsinption, for the use of the mem
bers, to a political journal, (Niles s Register,) the
expense whereof would exceed, according to calcu-
lations submitted at the time, ¿12,000 per annum
Mr D had been opposed to the adoption c f that
lesolulton it proposed a duect patronage of the
press for the individual pmpo-.es of the membeis
11 , w th others i p| ostd 11 it, succeedi 1 in 1 tying
it c n the taile, and it \ as but a icasonable conelu
sion that those who refused to h\ it on the table
w ere in favor of its adoption If Mr D was not
mistaken, his colleague [Mr Hopkins] voted
against laung it on the table This proposition
was a direct proffer of G ivernment patronage to a
political jonrnil, and moreover looked pretty much
as if it squinted at a censorship over said journal
Hi re, "it, is the resolution reported by "Mr Pit-
iom, from the Committee or the Library "
"Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Re-
presentatives be dnected to subscribe for ten num-
bers of'Kiles's Register'for each member rf the
He use, to be dehveied once a week Prowled, The
editor of said Register w ill agree to publish in, or
,'sapiU ot, said work, at least once a week,under
the direction cf the Cleik, the Journal- of the
Hotse, with thejeasand na\s on all questions
Ptovukd, fmVia, That the editor of said Register
will also agree to publish, at the end of every ses-
sion of Congless, under the direction of the said of-
ficei, a supplement to said work, containing all the
laws passed thereat, and treaties ratified by the Se-
nate to which shall be prefixed a copious index, to
be approved of by said officer, and furnish one
copy thereof, ftee of charge, to each member of
Congress for the lime being "
Mr D did not allud to this, foi th* purpose ef
making any charge of inconsistency upon his ho-
norable colleague, but mciely. that it might be s en
that those whs complain of the baneful influence
of Government patronage over the press, some-
times, unwarily perhaps, give votes having the
appearance of bestowing lhat veiy patronage so
stionglv deprecated.
Mr. D knew that it was \cry common for gen-
tlemen to talk about the conuption of the piess, by
the influence of the patronage of the Government,
and he kn-w lhat the subject of venal tditors,and a
subsidised press, filled up mm h of the ordinary
and regulai declamation oí the day
Much of these chaiges, oi all ot them, may be
true, and if so, are they not alike, and equally, ap-
plicable to all political parlies'* How far the elec-
tion of prmtei by this. House may conupt or influ-
ence the comse of the political journal under his
dnection, he would not undeitake to decide Not
would he andeitake to dechrc that a perton might
not be influenced by unwoiihy motives in seeking
the ofhee, and that he might not commit an act of
conuption m the veiy management or contrivance
by «Inch he effected his election
In relation to the present nominal printer to this
House, Mi D said he did not mean to aflirm or
deny any thing m releience to any influence which
his elestion may have had upon the course of his
paper It was nopaitol his business or purpose
to inqiuie U that papel had faithfully fulfilled Us
piotpectae piomises It was no concern of his to
know whethei a piudent observation of the co-
operating political influences which were visible in
his election had not had some effect in regulating
the tone, the tempei, and chiracter of its articles
No it was a matter of no moment to him to be
informed if this papei has not, by a natural and
gradual piocess, accommodated itself to the opi-
nions anil vieus of those lo whom it is known that
ihe editoi was mainly indebted fur his appointment
Of the course of tint pipei, Mr D said he had
but little know'edge, and (eriamly cared nothing at
all about it He had nothing lo do with the news-
piper or its concerns His pioposition applied to
Ihe punt   to this House
Rut, sUj ]\fi I) these enargis and lumors of
profligacy anil conuption art <(instantly reiterated
They aie not confim d to one paity alone It is not
al«a)s the same put) rganut whom the missiles

pirty in their mm hive lo wai 1 off blows levelled at
them, some limes with force and directness Sir,
crimination and rteiiniination is the employment
oi opposing pirties almost without mleimission
Why, sue! Mr D he ha t seen die (harge going the
iounds ih it a sirong combined ((lort was making
to laise an ixu nsiw fund to buy and establish a
prts , and to emplo\ a competent editor to publish
a new political j mrnal in this < it), and a circular,
purpi tt ng to be n^nel b) thice members of this
House, soliciting liberal contributions lor the sup
port of the e fiblishment, has been very conspicu-
ously exhibited to the public attention In relation
to this rna'ter, he had not i single remark to make,
either as to the truth of the charge, or the propriety
of the measure
Mi D sai 1 that he would take the liberty of
briefly adverting to one lemarkmade on yesterday
by his colleague, [Mr Wi"i,] in reference to ano-
'her subject His colleague had taken occasion to
refer to him as one ot th >se belonging to what was
denominated the Divoiee part)—that party which
was in favor of the In lependent Treasury bill.
Now, he did not complain of this allusion of his
colleague, but he was at a loss to perceive the con-
nection between that question and the one now be-
fore the House Mr D however, had no objec-
tion to avowing,  t this oi any other time, his opi-
nions on that subject He was one of those who
wished to organize the Treasury of the United
States upon it, true constitu'ional ground, and to
disconnect it entirely and wholly from its union
with State institutions He believed that good po-
licy required it, that past experience demonstrated
its necessity, and he believed it to be according to
the spirit of the Constitution, and Jhe obvious in-
tention of the framers of that instrument. He was
well satisfied, from reason and reflection, as well
as from the lights offormer experiments, that the
State banks, fiom their limited and local character,
and from their separate and unconnected existence,
under different State authorities, could never har-
moniously, adequately, and efficiently, perform the
functions of fiscal agents to the Federal Govern-
ment
Mr D. observed that it was a principle long
established in Virginia, that the business and ope-
rations of each Government, State and Federal,
should be kept separate and distinct That each
Government should beconfined to its own orbit—
lhat each should separately exercise its own ap-
propriate powers—that the offices and the adminis-
tration of the two Governments should not be uni-
ted or blended in the same persons—are in the
good old Commonwealth of Virginia, regarded as
cardinal doctrines The proposed connection be-
tween the banks and the Federal Government—the
mixture of the revenues of the two Governments
in the hands of a common fiscal agent—the trans-
fusion of the moneys of the Federal Government
into the business of corporations—are a palpable
violation of the political creed of Virginia, which
she has constantly and ardently cherished. Such
was the wakeful jealousy on this subject—such
the anxious desire to establish, and secure
this great punciple of State sovereignty, (doubtless
to guard effectually against any sinister influence
on the part of the Federal Government)—that at the
very fast session after the Virginia Convention had
ratified the Federal Constitution, the Legislature
enacted that any person holding any office or place,
any commission or appointment whatscever,
whether any pay oi emolument was attached there-
to oi not, or if in any way accepting or receiving
any emolument whatever, should be entirely dis-
qualified foi holding any office in the State And
the preamble of the act, after reciting that the con-
vention had assented to the Federal Constitution
and the creation of a Federal Government, declares
that " it is judged expedient and necessary that all
those employed in the administration of said Go-
vernment ought to be disqualified from holding or
administering any ofBee or place whatsoever under
the Government of the Commonwealth "
This was the doctrine maintained from the first
by the Revolutionary fatheis of the Old Dominion,
and solemnly embodied into law in 1788, at the
session that intervened between the act of ratifica-
tion and the commencement of the Federal Go-
vernment From that period to the present it has
been carefully preserved among our living sta-
tutes And for the purpose of upholding the sams
principle of keeping the State and all its institutions
exempt from any improper influence or inter-
ference by the Federal Government, it is a part of
our fundamental law, a piovision of oui amended
Constitution, that certain peison> in the service of
the United States shall be incapable of exeicising
the elective franchise. Mr D unhesitatingly
avowed that he was one of those who advocated
an entire separation between the revenues of
the Federal Government and «the State banks.
When that vitally important subject came up
for regular discussion, he hoped to have an
oppor'unity of giving his views on it at length;
and be thought he did not deceive himself in sup-
posing that upon that occasion, or upon his return
to the district which he had the honor lo represent,
he could give satisfactory reasons to his constituents
for the course which he should deem it his duty to
pursue At present he would say no more on this
topic, for he knew that remarks on it were uot per-
tinent to the subject matter under consideration, but
this much he had felt constrained to say, in conse-
quence of the direct allusion made to ins opinions
by his colleague, [Mr Wist ]
He would not longer detain the House, and
hoped that his amendment would be at once adopt-
ed, and that the whole resolution might pass, so
that his colleague, [Mr Hopkins,] the original
mover, might, without further delay, commence a
faithful and comprehensive investigation, with a
view to retrenchment and reform.
