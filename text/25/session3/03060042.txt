APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 10,
25th Cong....3d Slss.               Dry Bocks—Mr. Pickens, Mr. Petrikin, Mr. Stanly.
Ho. of Reps.
With the State banks It was m reference to this
that the gentleman endeavored to show that the
South was more favored than the North He
would leave it to the committee to say whether
this was logic or sophistry If any one wanted
to know which got the most of the public money,
let them look at the annual appropriation bills, and
he would soon find that for every thousand dollars
appropriated for objects at the South,onehundred
thousand was appropnated for those at the Noith
He did not complain of this when it was really
necessary, but could no more equal plan be pur-
sued? As to the money given fci the Plonda
war, he asked, was the money appropriated for
the support of that war expended in Florida? No
Where were the supplies obtained? wheie were
the contracts made? In Florida? No, the ap-
propriations went somewhere else North Car
olma got nothing. But could it indeed be neces-
sary that we should have a diy dock at JMcw
York, and another at Philadelphia too' while we
hada third so near as Noifolk? while there was
none all the way from Norfolk to New Oileans '
There was one thing he had seen here long, and
that was,  that whenever an appropriation  was
asked for a particular region, all the liepiesenta
tives fiom that quaiter went for it in solid column,
while at the same time they piofessed to  caie
nothing about getting the public money, but this
unity of action said more than many speeches
If we must have anothei dry dock let it be placed
at some point near the mouth of t ie Mississippi
They of the South might, peihaps, not be so sed
ulous and impoi túnate as northein gentlemen, but
was that a good leason why the South should not
get her full shaie'    Because they were unwilling |
to come cringing and ciawhng and  playing the
sycophant     He thought it was  a reason the |
other way, the Government ought rather to be
magnanimous, and give moie to those who ask
less     The gentleman made anothei remark he
would notice   he had said that the North, by I
being more industrious and persevering, would go
on to take everything ftom then southern neigh
bors, they came and speculated on our lands under
our very  eyes,  and weie building  up  Yankee
towns on southern soil     If the gentleman wished
to lecture the South for its good by such remaiks
as  these, the proper place to do it was at the
¡south, not heie, tins was not a fitting pltce foi
southern men to tel' the faults of then own pnent
But all this was out of the trick I he question
was whether the dock was needed, ind whether
New Yoik was the pioj ei place were both the
proposed docks necessaiy? He thought neithei
was needed, but if any waa built it ought to be at
the South
Mr PICKCNS said thit as, when up before,
lie sustained this appiopriation m theotigmal bill
of pOO 000 for a dry dock at New Yoik, he now
felt, from the range of discussion, dispooed to
make a few more íemaiks in addition to what he
had already said He would fust notice what had
fallen fren the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania,
[Mi PufKiKLN ] That gentleman had given us i
veiy g )od lecture on economy and Dunociitic
principles, and had thought pr >per to extend a
portion of it to him, (Mi P) He was-urpused
to find gentlemen from the South, who had here
tofore been good economists, ranged in snppoit
of this appropriation ' All this was good doc
trine, and (Mr P )only íegietted that the gentle-
man's practice had not entirely coiresponded with
his precept He (Mi P ) had taken that gentle-
man last session as his file leader on economy
The gentleman had even set his cue to the tune of
economy, that we might follow m his wake but,
sir, when we came to voting appiopnati > s foi
the Cumberland load, what was my astomshn ent
when I found my fue leader wheeling to th  rignt
about, and voting ay' And is thistle gertle
man to rise heie now, and read mea lecture on
economy, beeiu«e I choose to support an appro
puation of felOd.000 for a branch of your na tl
service, while he suppoited an appropriation of

wall youi navy     It is the only safe and efficient
arm of national defense in a free republic, and
some of the very gentlemen who will now vote
against this appropriation, you will find, at the
close of the session, voting what they have there-
by saved, and millions more, to dig out harbors
upon your inland seas, where God and nature
never intended that any should be Many gen-
tlemen who wdl now vote down such appropna
tions as the present, will combine hereafter in a
scheme of legislation under appropriations for
your Cumberland road, your light house and har-
bor bills, and youi othei thousand miserable local
appiopriahons, by which private speculators have
b"en enabled to swindle the country out of mil
lions, and yet all this is sound economy '
The true and only questions befoie the com-
mittee are, is a dry dock needed at New Yoik,
and is this appropriation fit and pioper' Upon
these points there is a concurrence of sentiment
in those who have consideied the matter Where
can such an establishment with more propuety
be located than in New York, the centei of com-
merce and navigation, and, notwithstanding all
her sins, in a commercial point of view, the pude
of the Republic ? We now lose more, foi want
of a diy dock at th it point, in two yeirs, by the
decay and mjuiy of oui ves elsof war, than would
be required to constiuct the dock From the ex
tieme noithern point on the coast of Maine to
Cape Cod, fiom Cape Cod to Cnpe Hatteras, and
fiom Cape Hatteias to Cape l fonda, and fiom
thence to the Sabine, by examination of tne map
you will find between each of these prominent
points gieat bays or indentures in the coast of the
United btites, and theie ought to be m the centei
of each navy yards on the most liberal and sub
stantial basts—one at Boston, one at New Yonc,
one at Charleston, and one at Pensaoola With
moie than two thousand miles of sea coast, and a
comparatively sparse population, it is vain and
idle to think of any othei efficient system of for
tification or national defense except by a navy
tn the next great conflict, your land iortifications,
which have been copied fiom the I lench system,
will be as impotent and useless (ex eptat isolated
points) as aie the castles in rui is 'hat now fiown
over Lurope, tiansmitting to us nothing but tin.
recollect! m of the barbanan nobility who once
inhabited them No, sn , ifwardoes come, (which
may God in his mercy aveit,) it will be upon
water, the fate of empue will thtie be oecided
Youi armies upon land will be of little or no
service Under the gieat chinges in modem
times, the uue system of defense and power is to
take advantageof all the inventions and impiove
ments (partiuulaily in stenm) of the day, and give
such efficiency to youi ? anj as vi 1 enable us to
meet any contingency that may ause I confess
that I am proud of being the supporter of that
elonous and noble arm of our national defence
It has borne our stais anil oui strij es in Ik i 01 tj
the mo t distant seas of the habitable elobe and
the votanes of fiecdom in eveiyltnd hive been
cheeted by the broad filds of oui national bnnner,
as it has swept along the remotest coasts of this
earth
But, sir, it has been said thatappiopmtionson
this subject have heretofoie been sectional, that,
while v. e have not íeceived our share, othei s have
tereived more than their share Sn , to a ceitain
extent this has been tiue, but Í contend that ex
penditures on this branch, moie than eveiy hmg
else connected wit! Government, have shed a
common benefit and a common blessing upon our
united country What can protect tne immense
pioductions of the South, floating over every sea
to foreign lands, as they do, but a vigilant and
efficient navy > If the sh'ps aie madeattheNoith,
and if they are manne 1 ly northern men, (but
we. nave oui full proportion of offii.eis,) yet if they
p-otect and defend our rich productions from the
plunderandopptesMon of foi eign Powers, we nave
a deep stake in supporting them It is the only
b* nch of public defense and public expenditure in
vvhi-h we have i pecuhai and deer  l He,es' And

ir- - rt rg p ipioniitt w s tl a' may be pioj ei to rut
ou- navy i i spankn g orde Look at the move
ments of the Fiench n the Gulf and on the coast
of Mexico Without pretending to censure them,
oi at piesent to question then rights, yet I will
say that their position upon a defenseless coast,
and amongst rich and defenseless islands, is tempt-
ing to their power, and if they withstand it they
have less ambition than the world attributes to
them Sir, what I mean to insinuate is, that m
the progress of events such a point may be occu-
pied, and such a position assumed, that the inde-
pendence of our commerce fiom the Mississippi
valley and through the Gulf may be rendeied
doubtful in the future And if such should be the
case, I do not hesitate to say it might raise the
question of peace or war
The independence of ten of the richest States of
this Union rests upon the freedom of the Gulf com-
merce being placed beyond the possible reach of any
foreign Power Is this the time for us to stmt ap-
piopnations for anything connected with your
navy ? Sir, I abhor that ciuel economy, which, to
save a few thousand dolíais now, would sacrifice
the blood of fieemen hereafter
I am in favor of the appropriation for Pensa-
cola, too, because 1 be'ieve efficient protection and
suppoit to oui navy on that extensive coast, its
íemote position, and the sparse population bor-
denng upon the Gulf of Mexico, all demand
fiom this Government its guaidian caie and mili-
tary piotection I believe, also, that all the States
in the valley of the Mississippi and the Ohio are
deeply interested in sustaining the power and effi-
ciency of our navy in the Gulf, pai ticularly at this
junfit e ofaffaus in that quaite) I go for appio-
pnations of this kind, not because they may be
of local benefit to this section or that section, but
because of their common benefit to my common
counti y True, our finances may be low, and let
us go foi an enlightened relienchmcnt and econ-
omy Yes, sir, strnce at your light-houses and
haiboi bills—your Cumbeiland road bill—your
new fortification bills—and all such like loose and
unnecessary appropnations    But, in God's name,
,1 do not strike at the navy, the pude and the orna-
! merit of the country, and particularly at this
period of the world, when eveiy otner maritime
Powei seems to  be concentrating then  national
|   ei eigies upon that arm of defense
Mark the progre&s of these things, and I pre-
dict, when you refuse such appropnations as this,
that m the las* thi ee days of this very sess on,
the 16th joint i ule of this House will be suspended,
in order to let in bids embracing all kinds of ap
propnations, whicn singly and alone, upon then
own independent ments, could never lecenethe
,  sanction of the majority of this House, upon full
I  oi fair discussion
I will here say that I cennotagree to the propo-
sition, or, as it h is been called, a bargain, proposed
I by the gentleman fio n New York, [M Hoff-
mh,] in iclation to the Philadelphia doi k It is
due ti candoi to say that I am opposed to that
a nendmpnt I i o not think itat all needed, if the
one at ¡New Yoi k is estal lished The sentiments
I have now avowed aie the same 1 have uttered
h°ie befoie, four yeais since I am opposed,
geneially, to appropnations upon land, oi for hi d

Mr  PClRiKlN rose amidst cues of " Ques-
I tion'" 'Cluesuon'" ¡The gentleman fi >rn is mth
Carolina [Mr Pickens] said he had voted for the
Cumberland road It was tl ue that he hid, and
he believed, at the time, it was light, and that he
was voting for the general good He had done it
partly on giounds of expediency, beciu«e the Gov-
ernment was undei a pledge but he found he hod
been deceived   He had been in the wioi g  he had
j found this out in a very few days after his vote
had been given, bu' if God and his constituents
would forgive him for this once, he never would
i vote another dollar in the same way as long as he
lived
