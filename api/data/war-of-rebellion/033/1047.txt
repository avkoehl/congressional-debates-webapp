HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE INDIAN TERRITORY,October 15, 1863.

Colonel T. C. BASS:

COLONEL: General Cooper is moving east, having left Stand Watie on the North Fork road, with a small force. You will collect all of your regiment, except a guard at Washita, of about 25 men, and move up as far as Limestone Gap, to be in readiness to support Colonel Watie. You will make such preparations for defenses the means at hand will admit of in the gap. Much can be done by cutting down threes and forming temporary breastworks to protect the few men you will have.

Your obedient servant,

WM. STEELE,

Brigadier-General.

Commanding Officer at Washita:

SIR: You will obey the orders of Colonel Bass, withdrawing the greater part of his regiment from Fort Washita.

Brigadier General D. H. COOPER:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 12th, with postscript of 16th, was received yesterday.

Please remember this omission, and I wish also you would suggest any course of operations that may appear to you as advisable under existing circumstances.

Your obedient servant,

WM. STEELE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Indian Territory.
