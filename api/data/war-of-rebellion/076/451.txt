this flank would be able to prolong the line to the Macon railroad, or better, that one corps, in addition to mine, could swing loose from the flank of the Fourteenth, strike in rear of East Point, and get a position crossing the railroad, from which we could not be driven. The country south of Utoy appears less broken and much more cultivated than north of it. Hascall is on the main Campbellton road. There is said to be a big road a short distance in his front leading to East Point. I have not been able to learn of any others in that vicinity.
