would do well to purchase as I am certain the expenses their would be 25 per cent. less than at Richmond, Raleigh or Columbia. If the Government should feel disposed to purchase I would suggest the appointment of Colonel William Johnston, of this place, as our agent to make the arrangements. He is very much a man of business. He is president of the Charlotte and Columbia road. I doubt not if the Government should conclude to engage his services and he would undertake them they would find him faithful. I find our people more disposed to subscribe in money than in produce. Our farmers make only cotton and tobacco. Would I be justifiable in taking subscriptions, payable when produce is sold, from responsible persons? Shall be here for ten days at court.

Very respectfully,

R. M. SOUNDERS.

RICHMOND, November 2, 1861.

Governor F. W. PICKENS, Columbia, S. C.:

I find on examination that the law requires the Quartermaster's Department to take charge of prisoners. I have appointed J. S. Coles a captain in Quartermaster's Department and posted him at Columbia, and have appointed J. H. Boatwright assistant surgeon. When can I send the remaining prisoners who are to occupy the Fair Grounds?

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

COLUMBIA, S. C., November 3, 1861.

Honorable Mr. BENJAMIN, [Acting] Secretary of War:

Prisoners at Fair Grounds would require too many men to guard them, unless they are officers to be trusted, but I send to three neighboring villages with good jails to get them to take them. Will let you know if they do.

F. W. PICKENS.

RICHMOND, November 4, 1861.

Governor F. W. PICKENS, Columbia, S. C.:

The law does not permit the appointment of a commissary for prisoners of war, and I cannot appoint two officers to do duty at Columbia when one alone will suffice. My first dispatch to you was written under the impression that the law committed the charge of providing sustenance for prisoners of war to the Commissary Department, but I discovered my error before making the appointment.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, November 4, 1861.

Governor H. T. CLARK, Raleigh, N. C.:

Your letter with inclosure of Colonel Johnston received. Much obliged for the trouble taken about the property at Salisbury. Will send an officer with the price who will take charge of the property. How many prisoners could be sent immediately with safety? Please answer.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.
