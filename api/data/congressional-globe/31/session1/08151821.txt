THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
of the public printing, of which the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Wentworth] is chairman.
The subject to which they relate is of vast im-
portance, and the proper disposition of it involves
a very large sum of money. It is due by the
House to the country, that the decision it shall
pronounce shall be taken with deliberation, and
upon % full- knowledge of the facts appertaining to
the subject. In no branch of public service have
grosser abuses occurred than in that of the public
printing.
This subject was referred, some four months
since, to a special committee, which has labori-
ously investigated the-matters within the proper
scope of inquiry submitted; and it is due to that
committee that the House should not act Upon
this subject in advance of their report.
A great number and variety of facts have been
collected and collated by the committee, which will
tend'to throw a true light upon the subject. I am
not now at liberty to dwell upon the testimony
taken by the special committee, or the conclusions
to which we. will arrive; but 1 will say, that, in
my opinion, the propositions of the joint commit-
tee suggest a mode of executing the public print-
ing which is grossly extravagant, and based upon
a view entirely erroneous. The increase of ex-
penditure which they propose I deem, under the
circumstances, utterly inadmissible.
Notwithstanding the representations of the con-
tractor, of the ruin by which he will be over-
whelmed should he proceed with the execution of
his contracts, nothing has been elicited to satisfy
.me of that fact. He may, and probably will sus-
tain a loss; but that cannot justify the House in
doing more than permitting a release of the re-
mainder of the work to be executed. It will not
justify any reclamation of damages to cover the
loss already incurred. It should be known to the
House how Mr. Belt became contractor; under what
circumstances he bid for the public work at the
rate of which he now so bitterly complains; in
line, whether he is an innocent purchaser of pat-
ronage, without a knowledge of consequences to
result from too cheap a bid, or whether he under-
bid btma fide bidders at the lettings, relying upon
the political partialities of members of Congress
to relieve him from a dilemma in which he became
voluntarily involved. Will the House not con-
sider it proper to delay until we can see with what
aim and object this unfortunate g'entleman inter-
fered in the matter of the public printing? 1 cer-
tainly deem such delay advisable.
But, the resolutions relate back to the com-
mencement of the session, and will authorize pay-
ment to the contractor at a rate not only notspeci-
fied by his contract, but so far beyond that rate
that he will be paid for what is now done, more
profit than would have contented a competent
printer for the whole work to be done during the
year. The honorable chanman holds up to your
view the first part of the President's message, and
exclaims that ihe contractor is allowed only twen-
ty-nine and a half cents per volume for that work.
He informs the House that his resolutions will
swell that compensation to seventy-six and a half
cents. The difference amounts to about one hun-
dred and sixty per cent, additional profit! We or-
dered fifteen thousand extra numbers of the rfies-
sage and accompanying documents, according to
my recollection, and the proposed increase of com-
pensation for the first part of that document (there
being three parts) will swell the pointer's bill from
forty-five hundred dollars to near twelve thousand
dollars. Is it possible this can be just to the peo-
ple we represent? If this rate of increase is to
attach to the whole public printing, how enormous
the aggregate of additional profit to the contractor,
and how stimulating to a repetition of the piactice
of under-bidding, reserving a reliance upon the
machinery of party to alter the result of the con-
tract.
What was the difference between the bids of
the piesent contractors and those of their com-
petitors? I may be permitted to suppose that a
punter of experience in his profession, competent
as to means, billing to embark his fortune in the
business of printing for Congress, and ready to
devote his time to the prosecution of the business,
placed his bid before the Clerk, after a minute cal-

culation of the rates at which he could perform the
contract so as to realize a fair and living profit. If
the bid of such a person should turn out to~exceed
the actual bids of the present contractors by no
more than fifty-one thousand dollars, is it not pal-
pable that this House cannot be justified in voting
a sum greater than fifty-one thousand dollars to
these contractors for what they have perfoimed,
releasing them from the remnant of the contract?
Mark, sir, in that sum of $51,000 1 suppose the
printer to have calculated his profit; is it not cer-
tain that the point at which a loss commences must
be far below that sum? The representations of
ruin which have been made are the exaggerations
of fear, Mr. Speaker, if not of interest. We should
look minutely at the facts before these representa-
tions become the guides of our judgment. I have
heard much, out of doors, on this point, but I
venture to say that when the cost of executing the
public priming is compared with the fate of the
contract, two percent. ivill cover the actual loss, if,
indeed, there shall appear am, loss. Let us not be
frightened from our propriety, but come calmly to
the consideration of this whole subject. It is a
matter of very great public importance. JNo
branch of public expenditure makes much larger
gaps in the public treasure than the public print-
ing, and none has yielded so large profits to the suc-
cessful employes of Government, when adroitly
managed.
But, sir, ther$ is a peculiarity about these reso-
lutions which invites especial scrutiny. No simi-
lar instance of liberality can be found of record
among the archives of the public printers or of
Congress. It is a real bon bouche offered to this
side ofthe House, for which, nodoubt, we should
be duly thankful—I mean the voluntary partition
of the public printing with G^les and Seaton.
Is the capacity of the Union office insufficient to
enable the work to be done there? Does this fact
occasion this remarkable stretch of generosity ? It
is a magnanimity to which parties are not accus-
tomed. Surely, it is not designed to imbody the
strength of both parties in this Hall by the pre-
sentation of this proposition to divide; hut I respect-
fully submit, that it is a carious specimen of combi-
nation, which cannot fail to attract attention, and
which both sides of this House ought, deliber-
ately, to examine before its adoption. If the tes-
timony before the special committee should ex-
hibit a willingness among the proprietors of the
Union and Intelligencer to do the public printing
on joint account, or that each should have a moiety9
and that the proprietors of another newspaper
should have the printing of the departments, pro-
vided they can, by joint effort, induce Congress to
abandon the contract system, what would the
couniry think of the passage of these resolutions -
after the development of that combination shall
h$ve been made? If the contract system is wrong,
abandon it; if it is right, adhere to it. If you find
the proprietors of the press unanimous in their de-
sire to leturn to the law of 1810 as the standard by
which prices shall be regulated, and find that they
propose 20, 30, 40, 45, 66 per ccnt. below those
prices, as rates at which they will contract, vou
have testimony at once befoie you that the stand-
ard is very high, and the point at which business
men will settle for a fair compensation deserves
more investigation than we are enabled to-day to
gave to this subject. I am opposed to the sealing
and delivery of this new contract at this time. 1
claim for the " craft" of the country another day
for the hearing of this case. 1 claim for the people
another investigation before judgment. I repre-
sent that the special committee are now only de-
layed from nie entin* a report by the examination
of ustinony which Mr. Ritchie desires to bring
before them, an as he is the party beneficially
interested, «.& u tpp^ars, I submit that, while his
case is under heaimg before the tribunal to which
a proper investigation of it haa been releried by '
this House, there should be no call upon the House
to pronounce judgment. Let it come on the nurits.
Mr. PARKER desired to ask the gentleman
from Kentucky whether the special committee had
not caused the delay to which this case was now
to be subjected, by refusing to allow IVlr. Ritchie
to -cross-examine the witnesses as the investigation
progressed, and whether the testimony in chie f was
not concluded before the committee allowed Mr.
Ritchie to recall any witnes&r
Mr. MARSHALL. It is true Mr. Ritchie was
not permitted to cross-examine the witnesses as
