BALDWIN, February 11, 1864.

Major-General GILLMORE:

Your telegram just received. Command left for Sanderson. No news from Henry. Tilghman is at Baldwin. Two companies of Tilghman here. Fribley at Pickett's. No negroes came in, or anybody else. I will keep you advised promptly. This is the place to fortify.

T. SEYMOUR,

Brigadier-General.

APPENDIX M.

SANDERSON, February 12, 1864-7 a.m.

Major-General GILLMORE:

I last night ordered Colonel Henry to fall back to this point. I am destroying all public property here and shall go back to South Fork Saint Mary's as soon as Henry returns. I have not heard from him since last night, when he was 7 miles this side of Lake City. I hope he will be in this morning. I am sending a regiment out to meet him. Sanderson cannot be fortified to advantage. I would advise sending Fribley's regiment to Palatka and to make it a point to hold permanently.

T. SEYMOUR.
