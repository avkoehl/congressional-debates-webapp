RICHMOND, VA., February 20, 1863.

Major General A. P. HILL,

(Care of General R. E. Lee:)

GENERAL: In reply to yours of the 7th instant, inquiring as to the source from whence the commissions for officers of the North Carolina State troops should issue, I am directed by the Secretary of War to say that the question is before the Attorney-General of the Confederate States for decision. In the mean time the right to commission appears in several instances to have been conceded to the Governor of North Carolina. There is not much doubt that the decision of the Attorney-General will be that the Governor has the right to appoint, as he has so decided in similar cases in other States.

Very truly, &amp;c.,

E. A. PALFREY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Troops still landing at Newport News. Impression in Norfolk that 30,000 arrived, and that movement against Richmond. All communications with Suffolk cut off evidently to conceal some movement. large numbers of horses landed at Newport News and wagon trains moving some miles up the river.

Gold in New York 161 and rising.

Bill to employ privateers passed United States Senate. McDougall said was with France before fall.

Respectfully,

ROGER A. PRYOR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
