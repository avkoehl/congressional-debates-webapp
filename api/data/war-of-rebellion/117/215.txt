OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., July 14, 1862.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio.

MAJOR: I am informed that you continue to permit visitors to see prisoners under your charge notwithstanding my explicit and repeated instructions to the contrary. I can scarcely believe that this offense has been repeated, though the report comes to me in such a shape as to leave little room for doubt or the chance of mistake.

I should be less inclined to credit the report if I did not know that ladies had been allowed to have interviews with prisoners and to go inside the prison yard, all of which was in violation of my orders.

Hereafter I must insist on a rigid observance of my orders, and when a visitor is permitted an interview at the request of Governor Johnson, of Tennessee, you will forward their letters to me and please forward immediately any letters on which interviews have heretofore been granted.

Please remember that prisoners' letters are examined to ascertain that they contain no improper matter, not to gratify idle curiosity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Detroit, Mich., July 14, 1862.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio.

MAJOR: Please say to Mr. Vasser that the arms belonging to officers which are at Columbus are in very safe hands and expect to be returned to the owners whenever they are released. A parole can be granted to Lieutenant Hubbard only on the certificate of Doctor Woodbridge that his health is such as to make it highly necessary that he should be permitted to leave the island for a few days. The application must be approved by you and then I must only consent to his going to Cleveland.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Detroit, July 14, 1862.

R. R. ROSS, Esq., Clarksville, Tenn.

SIR: Your letter of the 3rd ultimo in behalf of the sons of H. P. Carney and G. H. Warfield, prisoners of war at Camp Douglas, has been referred to me, and in reply I have to inform you that paroles can be granted only by the Secretary of War. The young men that you refer to are in the same class with many others, being the sons of loyal parents, and as all must be treated alike where there is no reason for special consideration, it is not probable paroles will be granted in those cases. Parents are permitted to see their sons in cases of severe illness at the prison.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
