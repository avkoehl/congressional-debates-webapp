West Virginia, reported it with amendments.
Mr. EDMUNDS. lam instructed by the
Committee on Pensions, to whom were re-
ferred certain papers relating to the claim of
Dr. John Templeton for services as surgeon
in the tenth Tennessee cavalry, and for losses
sustained bj him during the war, 10 report them
back, and ask to be discharged from their fur-
ther consideration. They do not relate to the
subject of pensions at all. 1 imagine they
should go to the Committee on Claims.
Mr. HOWE. Oh, no; do notsend them back
to the Committee on Claims. I think that that
committee has once or twice acted on this
ease.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Committee
on Pensions will be discharged from the further
consideration of the papers, and they will lie
on the table.

STENOGRAPHS!* FOK DISTRICT SU PRE MB COURT.
Mr. HAMLIN. I believe that I have been
in my sent every day of the session of Con-
?ress from its commencement until now, and
believe I have been absent no consecutive
hour of the session in anyone day ; and I now
wish to ask a little reward of merit. A few
days since a bill reported by the Committee on
the District of Columbia came up for action,
authorizing the supreme court of this District
to appoint a stenographer. I think there was
no objection to the bill save that certain Sen-
ators thought there ought to be a provision
imposing certain fees from which to pay that
stenographer, and the bill was recommitted.
I think there was no other objection urged to
it. I have prepared, and the committee have
now authorized me to report back the bill with
that amendment to pay the stenographer from
fees imposed, to wit, two dollars upon each
case; and as I desire to be absent to-morrow
with my family I ask the Senate to consider the
bill at this time.
Mr. CAMERON. I have no objection to the
bill, but it seems to me wrong that we should
encourage the breaking up of good habits.
Everybody begins his bad habits at some par-
ticular time, after having been good. Now,
' I am afraid if we let the Senator from Maine
go off after having so long continued here
without ever absenting himself he may want
to go away next week again. [Laughter.] I
will make no objection.
By unanimous consent, the biR (S. No. 481)
to provide for the appointment of a stenog-
rapher to the supreme court of the District of
Columbia was considered as in Committee of
the Whole.
The amendment was to strike out all of the
bill after the enacting clause and to insert:
That the justices of the supreme court of the Dis-
trict of Columbia shall have authority to appoint a
stenographer at a salary of $2,500 per annum, pay-
able quarterly by the clerk of said court, out of the
fund and in the manner hereinafter provided for,
who shall be a sworn officer of the court, and whose
duty it shall be to make reports as the court shall
direct of the proceedings and evidence in the cases
before said court.
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted. That in all actions
or suits commenced or entered in said sapreme court,
by declaration, bill, or otherwise, the party or par-
ties commencing or entering thesame shall,in addi-
tion to the fee or fees already prescribed, pay to the
clerk of said court, at or before the commencement
of such action or entering of such suit, the sum of
two dollars in each and every action or suit so com-
menced or entered; and that said sum of two dollars,
in rach and every case aforesaid, shall bÂ« applied by
said clerk to the payment of the salary of said sten-
ographer, as hereinbefore provided; and in case the
fund thus created for the payment of the salary of
said stenographer shall be inadequate for that pur-
pose, the clerk of said court is hereby authorized and
directed to charge and collect two dollars in each
suit in which the United States shall be a party, in
addition to the fees now allowed by taw, which shall
be paid to said stenographer; but he is not to receive
more than $2,500. And the said fees authorized in
this act shall be charged in the accounts of said clerk
and allowed in the adjustment of said accounts in
accordance with the provisions of an act entitled
"An act to provide the modes of settling the accounts
of the clerk of the supreme court of the District of
Columbia," approved July 25, 1806.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amend-
ed, and the amendment was concurred in.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
passed.
