HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 25, 1864-8 a. m.

General BIRNEY:

Ord does not like to let Ames go this morning. Must you have him, or, in other words, is the movement in your front over?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding Department:

In executing my order to charge and retake the line from enemy we captured 30 privates and 2 commissioned officers. This make, I think some 50 altogether. My lines are re-established.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

General Foster, commanding Turner's division, reports an attack on his picket-line at several points, but that it has not been forced in.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

We send you three prisoners. During the assault they held for a while a portion of our trenched picket-line. We have retaken all but one point, and will take that. They advanced with a line almost of battle.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,August 25, 1864-8.45 a. m.

General BIRNEY,

Tenth Corps:

Will any of your corps be sent to relieve part of mine to-day? I should know beforehand and the time to expect them. Of the two brigades of General Terry's division, one 1,000 and the other 800, only 700 arrived during the night in time to relieve a part of General Ames' division. To prevent such straggling in the night is difficult. General Ames, with 1,500 men, is on the road an should cross the Appomattox before 11 a. m. The remainder of his division will march as soon as they can be relieved by General Terry's.

E. O. C. ORD.
