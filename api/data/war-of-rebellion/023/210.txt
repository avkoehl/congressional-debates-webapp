Brigadier General S. S. FRY, Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: You are directed by Major-General Thomas to cross your brigade at Florence with as little delay as possible and march direct to Pulaski by way of Lawrenceburg. As General Buell's trains are threatened by bodies of cavalry you will be vigilant and keep your troops on the alert all the time.

On your arrival at Pulaski communicate at once with the commandant at Reynolds' Station. Look to the protection of that point and convoy the wagon train from Reynolds' to Athens by an infantry force of strength determined by what may be learned of the dangers to be guarded against. You will receive further orders after you return to Athens.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
