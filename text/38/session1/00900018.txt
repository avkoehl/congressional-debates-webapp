THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 14,
Be, we pray Thee, with the oppressed and the
enslaved, to ransom them and lead them out of
their house of bondage. Be with the freedmen,
to raise them to be fellow-citizens with us in the
high privileges of this Republic.
Finally, be with our enemies; crush and hum-
ble tyrants in the dust, and disinthrall a people
maddened by partisan passions. Father, we pray
Thee, by Thine influences, to restore them in loyal
service once more to this Republic.
And now, with a spirit of universal equity, give
us universal freedom. May Thy kingdom come
and Thy will be done. We ask it for and in the
name and as the disciples ofThy beloved Son, our
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we ascribe
praise and glory to Thee forever. Amen.
The Journal of Thursday last was read and
approved. •
