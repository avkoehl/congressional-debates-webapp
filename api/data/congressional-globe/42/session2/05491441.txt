1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1441
act shall be so far repealed as not to cover into
the Treasury the surplus balances of the judi-
ciary fund. It was urged that we could never
tell in advance how much would be needed,
and the work of the courts ought to go unim-
peded. But the Committee on Appropriations
have so great a respect for that provision of
law that they have not assented to the request
of the Department of Justice in this regard.
Now, in the year just closed there was a
balance of $1,745,914 88 in this judiciary fund,
arisingfrom fines, forfeitures, and penalties of
the last two yeara; and also a fund of $768,000
of former accumulated and unexpended bal-
ances, making about two and a half million
dollars in the judiciary fund unexpended, and
which, but for the provision of the law of
July, 1870, would be available for the pur-
poses of that Department. On the 30tk day
of June last that large sum was covered back
into the Treasury. As a matter of course, it
left the Department of Justice with no fund
except the amount appropriated for the current
year.
During the last six years the total expend-
iture on account of the judiciary fund, stated
in round numbers, was as follows: in 1866 the
amount expended was $1,362,000; in 1867, it
was $1,614,000; in 1868, $1,789,000; inl860,
$2,075,000 ; in 1870, $2,215,000, and in 1871,
$2,769,000. Now, the committee will see that
from 1866 down, our total annual expenditures
from the judiciary fund, the expenditures have
risen from $1,833,333 to $2,750,000; and the
appropriations have been comparatively small,
ranging from $l,000,000to $1,500,000 a year,
for the reason that the receipts from fines and
forfeitures and penalties usually amounted to
a larger sum than the amount annually appro-
priated. Now for the first time that whole sum
arising from fines, forfeitures, and penalties
has gone back into the Treasury, and we must
appropriate the whole amount required for the
expenses of the judiciary. There is the mys-
tery. This is the huge cat which the gentleman
thinks is concealed under the meal.
If gentlemen will notice the appropriations
already made for the present fiscal year, they
will find that it was $2,000,000. My friend
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes,] knowing
that he had cut off the supply from fines,
forfeitures, and penalties, and not knowing
precisely what amount would be needed
"lumped" the gross amount of $2,000,000,
and waited to see how far it would go. The
total amount needed for the present year is
now estimated at $1,000,000 more than was
appropriated. The total expense last year
was $2,769,000, and if the deficiency now
asked for for the current year be all used up,
it will make the total expense for this year
only $231,000 more than the total expendi-
tures of last year. If the whole amount of
increase were required to enforce the Ku KIux
law, about which the gentleman from New
York [Mr. Cox] is so much troubled, it would
still be not an extravagant increase. But
there are several other items of increase be-
sides the Ku Klux law.
Mr. COX. How much did the judiciary
cost in 1860, in a time of peace?
Mr GARFIELD, of Ohio. I cannot answer
that question at this moment.
Mr. COX. I have the statement showing
that the cost now is three times as much. In
1860, under Democratic rule, the expense was
$1,000,000, and there was no deficiency bill.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I have now a
list of the appropriations running back to
1860. In 1860 $1,000,000 was appropriated,
and in 1861, 1862, and 1863, $1,000,000 was
appropriated each year, and so it runs on,
one year only $304,000 being appropriated,
and some years the appropriation was $1,500,-
000. The gentleman seems not to know or
seems to have forgotten that during every one
of these years all 'the fines, penalties, and
forfeitures were added to that fund, and ex-
pended when found necessary without any

specific appropriation of law. He will there-
fore see that the amounts annually appropri-
ated do not show the annual expenditures.
But I have said that the amount needed for the
present year will be greater than for the last,
and for several reasons. In the first place,
we are now paying a larger compensation to
jurors than was paid before 1871. We in-
creased the fee paid to jurors by the act of
July 15, 1870, from two to three dollars a
day. In the second- place, the reconstruction
acts and the Ku Klux acts have increased
our expenditures. Third, the naturalization
law of July 14, 1870, also increased the judi-
cial expenses of the Government. Finally,
under our late law creating a Department of
Justice, all special counsel before paid by
different Departments, War, Navy; and Inte-
rior, &c.,are now paid from the judiciary fund.
The following letter from the Department of
Justice gives a full official statement of facts
which 1 have presented in substance :
Department of Justice,
Washington, December 29,1871.
Slit: Permit me to call your attention to the ne-
cessity of promptly supplying the deficiency in the
appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1872, for defraying the expenses of the courts of the
United States, &e., commonly known as the "judi-
ciary fund."
This appropriation in the act of March 3,1871,
" for sundry civil expenses of the Government for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, and for other
purposes," is $2,000,000. (16 United States Statutes,
page 498.)
The amounts expended under a similar appropri-
ation for several years prior to the present were as
follows:
For the year ending June 30,1866 $1,362,606 06
For the year ending Juno 30,1867  1,614,877 59
For the year ending June 30,1868  1,789.177 76
For the year ending June 30,1869  2,075,892 89
For the year ending June 30,1870   2,215,767 84
For the year ending .iune 30,1871  2,769,034 08
A large part oi crach of these sums was derived
from fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which are now
withdrawn from the judiciary fund and go directly
into the Treasury.
The increase is partly accounted for by the steady
growth of the judicial business of the country. It
is estimated that about three hundred thousand dol-
lars of the increaso during the last year was caused
by the increased compensation of jurors under the
act of July 15, 1870. (16 United States Statutes,
page 363.)
Certain other recent statutes have added to the
drafts upon this appropriation. Among them are
the " enforcement acts " of May 31, 1870, and April
20,1871, the naturalization act of July 14,1870, and
the "amended enforcement act" of February 28,
1871. These acts largely increase the expenses for
witnesses, jurors, prisoners, and the incidental
charges connected with the courts; all of which are
defrayed out of the fund in question.
By the effect of the act to establish the Depart-
ment of Justice, this fund is now burdened with the
expense of special counsel for the Government—a
burden which was previously distributed among the
Departments.
It will be perceived that the amount appropriated
for this year is less than has been required for the
purposes of this appropriation in each of the three
next preceding years.
The amount drawn from this fund from the 1st of
July last to the 15th instant is $1,393,983 07.
The present appropriation will probably be ex-
hausted by the end of February next. The great
increase in the criminal business now coming before
the courts must be considered in estimating the
amount necessary to complete the present fiscal
year.
I am satisfied that it would not be prudent to
appropriate less than $1,000,000 to supply the defi-
ciency.
Very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
A. T. AKERMAN, Attorney General.
Hon. James A. Garrfield, Chairman Committee on
ApproprialionSt iloaye of lieprenentatives, Wash'
iagton, D. C.
For myself I have endeavored to keep pol-
itics out of these appropriation bills, for I
have been anxious to push forward the public
business. But if gentlemen on the other side
are anxious to turn ordinary public business
into partisan political discussion they will find
plenty of gentlemen on this side ready to meet
them.
I did fully criticise the Ku Klux bill as it
was first introduced in the House, and, with
the aid of other gentlemen on this side acting
with me, many changes were made in the bill
before it became a law. The provision for
martial law was stricken out. And the trials
provided for in the law as it now stands are
trials before the_ civil courts of the United
'States, trials of citizens who commit atrocious
crimes against the lives, liberty, and property
of citizens of the United States. I have no
doubt that this House will cheerfully appro-
priate the sums necessary to maintain the
courts of the country.
Mr. NIBLACK. X believe I was not pres-
ent when this particular paragraph was consid-
ered by the Committee on Appropriations, and
therefore I do not consider myself responsible
for it in any way. It is a very large deficiency,
and in the absence of a detailed statement of
the items composing it, I, for one, do not feel
like voting so large a sum for the purpose des-
ignated. I am the more impelled to this
course by reason of the extraordinary duties
we have imposed upon the judges by our legis-
lation the last few years, and I firmly believe,
so far as I can have any belief in regard to such
a question, that many of those laws imposing
duties upon the judiciary of the country are
unconstitutional and void, and I am disposed
to vote appropriations, very sparingly for the
purpose of enabling those laws tobc executed.
While I am not prepared, sir, to say that
this item is not needed by the public service,
yet as I have not sufficient evidence of that
fact, I, for one, will vote to strike it out. I will
vote for no appropriation of this kind which
I am not satisfied, from some evidence or other
calculated to bring conviction to my mind, is
absolutely necessary to carry on the ordinary
routine business of the courts. I do not want
to do that which is illiberal. If I have fallen
into any error in matters of this sort it is that
I am disposed to he too indulgent to appeals
made from the Departments and from the ex-
ecutive authority for money with which to carry
on the Government. We are dependent on the
Departments and on the officers of the Gov-
ernment for the grounds on which we vote
away money every day. We cannot examine
all the items, and we have to rely verp much
on the Departments for the information we
get in regard to the amounts which we vote.
In the absence, then, of that information
which I think we ought to have on questions
of this kind, I shall, as one member of the
Committee on Appropriations, vote to strike
out this particular item that it may be reserved
for future consideration.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, rose.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is exhausted on
this amendment.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I withdraw the
amendment.
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri. I renew it for
the purpose of enabling me to submit a few
remarks to the committee. It is well known
that I opposed what is termed the Ku Klux
bill. I voted against it on the ground that it
was unconstitutional; not because I doubted
.the fact that there existed in the southern
States combinations against the free exercise
of the rights of citizens, but simply on consti-
tutional grounds. A number of _ gentlemen
are now opposing this appropriation for the
same reason, I presume, because they consider
it unconstitutional. Upon that point I differ
from them. The law while it stands upon our
statute-books must be recognized as constitu-
tional, and although I was opposed to it at the
time of its passage, I cannot vote against an
appropriation for its execution as long as it
stands unrepealed or has not been decided to
be unconstitutional by the judicial tribunals
of our coixntry. I think it would be impoli-
tic far us to take such a position _ as that
with reference to laws enacted by this body.
Why, sir, if that principle should be adopted,
gentlemen here might go back and object to
every appropriation which involves the pay-
ment of money to members of the House sent
here under the reconstruction policy of the
Government. To be consistent in carrying
out the principle they must do that. Now, I
do not think it is politic to go back upon mat-
ters in this way. We must accept these matters
