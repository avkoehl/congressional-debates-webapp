engasre them—he would not undertake to decide,
ot this the Senate were convinced, that it wis a
sul>)tot wholly free from all party feelings, or
from inv other Mmstt r influence that could mis-
lend the mind Nothing could be further from
tin. expedition of those who \oted for this bill,
thnn an idea of violitmg the Constitution, or m-
fnnging upon Executive prerogative, and the
frnnknts*, the conciliitmg temper, togetlm with
the concluding senttnee of the veto messige,
afford unquestionable evidence of the good spirit
thit movid the Executivt.
The President in hi  message,his quoted those
parts of the Constitution which he thinks bear
upon this sublet, and has arranged them in suc-
cession; it will be useful, and will facilitate con-
struction if we examine and remark the location
of these quoted sections of the Constitution, and
see their bearing The first quotation is from the
first artit le m the Constitution, which treats of
the two Flouses of Coligues, and the conclusion
of the fifth section n fers to the several powtrs of
each House The m xt section, in the sime
article, which is quoted, rt firs to the^oinf powers
of the two Houses The first says that " neither
Hou e, during the session of Congress, shall,
without the consent of the other, adjourn for
more than three days, nor to any other place than
that in which the two Houses shall be sitting."
The obvious design of this section is, to keep
the two houses together, both as to time and
place, ptnding their session The next quotation
is from that st uion of the snme article which
prescribes the course that bills shall take in Con-
gress before they become laws, as well as the
course of every order, resolution, or vote, to
which the concurrence of the two Houses is ne-
cessary, and is in the following word*- " Every
order, resolution, 01 vote, to which the concur-
rence of the Senue and House of Representatives
may be necessary, ^except on a question of ad-
journment,) shall be presented to the President of
the United States," A.c , and shall be subject to
his approbation or disapprobation, as bills are
Thus this section regulating the course of bills
in Congress, as well as all resolutions, orders, or
votts, which require the concurrent vote of both
Houses, provides that thev shall be presented to
the President for his approbation or disappioba-
tion, but excepts the question of adjournment
from that course. They who framed the Consti-
tution, having in the orevious section provided
that, pending' the sesston of Congicss, the two
Houses should not have the power to adjourn for
more than three davs, nor to another place than
that in which they ahull be sitting, excepted this
question of adjournment, thus arranged, from the
prescribed course of other joint acts of the two
Houses, thus making the pphcation of this ex-
ception of the question ot idjournmeiit, directly
and naturally, to the fort going adjournment,
pending the session But the President, in his veto
message, contends that the question of adjourn-
ment is not a matter of legislation, and rests it
upon this clause in the Constitution, and there I
think, with respectful de.fi rence, is the error in
the message, viz , imking tin. exception of ad-
journment in the clause stated universal in its
application instead of special to adjournments,
pending the session
The power of regulating the sessions of Con-
gress by law seems to be an incidental and neces-
sary power Already the sessions of Congress
are in part regulateil by law The commence-
ment of the sessions is prescribed by the highest
law, the Consitutmn, empowering Congress to
change it by law if they think proper, and the
termination of a Congress is also prescribed by
law the doubt arises exclusively upon reflating
the first session of Congress, which is always the
long session The bill now under consideration
takes away no power from a future Congress, as
it providt s " that the day of adjournment of the
first session of every succeeding Congress shall
be the second Monday in May, unless Congress
shall at any such session, by joint resolution,
otherwise provide " If it is thought, therefore,
that the good of the country and the convenience
of Congress require that this long session should
be 1 mited by law, unless tlie Congress in session at
the time should find it necessary to providt othei-
wise, shall it be prohibited to Congiess to effect
this good and this convenience merely because
the question of adjournment is excepted from being
presented to the President for his approbation,
ns all otherresolutions, orders, or votes are,which
require a concurrent vote of both Houses > This
would seem to be a strained construction, and
more particulaily as a much more natural and
direct application of that exemption has been
shown to the adjournments authorized during a
sesston
The next quoted section of the Constitution is
from the article relating to the Executive, and is
the third section, which treats on the regular and
eventful power of the Executive.   It is in these '
words-                                                                          I
" He [the President] mav, on extraordinary occasions,
convene both Honres, or either <>l them, and, in ease ot
til-- vreeinunt between them vith re^pttt u  the time ol
all niriiinent, he mly adjourn them 10 such lime as he
-.hell think proper," &c
Prom this section the President, in his veto
message, concludes that the proposal to fix a day
by law, to be binding in all future time, unless
changed by consent of both Houses of Congress,
is "to take away the contingent power of the
Executive, which, in anticipated cases, is vested
in htm " Here, again, I think the President
geneializes too much in his construction If we
examine this section closely, we shall find both
its grammatical and legal construction in exact
concurrence The part of the third section of the
second article quoted is one sentence, where all
its parts have a direct reference to each other,
and to nothing else. In enumerating the eventual
or contingent powers of the Executive, it states,
that " he may, on extraordinary occasions, con-
vene both Houses, or either of them," and then
goes on, in the same breath, to say, " in case of
disagreement between them in respect to the time
of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such
time as he pleases," evidently confining this
power to the convention of both Houses " on
extraordinary occasions"—where, as experience
has shown, it would be much more likely to
anticipate that its use would be necessary.
By thus confining the exercise of this contingent
power of interfering in adjournments (grammat-
ically and by every principle of construction, as
I have done) to the special cases referred to,
and with which it is placed in immediate rela-
tionship, the contingent Executive power is left
untouched, and no fear ot its invasion remains;
and that such is the true construction I cannot
hesitate to adopt With these views, I am con-
strained to dissent from the veto
I would say a word upon the policy of this law
if it was admissible at this time, as I am con-
vinced that these extremely protracted sessions
of Congress are injurious; and must eventually,
if persisted in, duve those men fiom Congress
who are most fit and best qualified to be there
But I do not consider this question now before
us, the policy of this law has been decided by a
large majority of both Houses, and is conceded
by the Executive; the only question before you
is that which is presented by the veto, and which
has been spread upon your journals, the constitu-
tional question, and on that we are alone called to
decide Any other course would involve an ab-
surdity, for suppose a Senator here, who, object-
ing to the policy of the law, but entirely clear as
to its constitutionality, opposed its passage, the
President returns the law with a constitutional
objection alone, admitting its sound policy. If
such Senator, confident that the law is constitu-
tional, still perseveres to decide on his opinion
of its policy, which is already decided on and
admitted, he sustains the veto in effect, though
he condemns and opposes it in opinion; and the
expiess object of the veto, in presenting the Pres-
ident's special objections to a. law for considera-
tion, fails. ________________________
I                       INDEPENDENCE OP TEXAS.
REMARKS OF HON. S.L SOUTHARD,
OF NEW JERSEY,
In Senate, July 1,1836,
On the Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations
respecting Texas
II       Mr SOUTHARD said:
I'     Mr. President: The opinion and wishes ex-
pressed by the Senator from South Carolina [Mr.
C^lhoin] induce me to say a few words before
the vote is taken. I am willing to give my assent
to the resolution presented for our consideration
by the Committee on Foreign Relations, and also
to the amendment offered by the Senator from
South Carolina, [Mr Prestov ] They may be
justified by the events which have occuned, and
by the case as it appears before us; but I am not
willing to proceed further nor bind myself to any
ultimate course on the subject. We are too igno-
rant of the existing condition of Texas in many
íespects, and have too slight materials on which
to form an estimate of her future prospects, to
justify us, in our capacity as Senators, in pro-
nouncing a decision that may implicate the in-
terests of this nation with hers Both in the
principles avowed in the report of the committee,
and in the conclusion at which it arrives in the
resolution, we go quite as far as prudence and
sound policy will permit. Even they may lead
us, at no distant day, into difficulties of which our
excited sympathies and ardent feelings do not, at
this moment, take proper cognizance.
I am not prepared to unite in the general ex-
pression of a belief that the independence of Texas
is secured, and her struggle over It seems to
me impossible that this can be the case Texas
may—she probably will—at some period, per-
haps not remote, establish her independence on
a foundation which Mexico cannot shake. She
has temptations to offer to enterprise, ambition,
and avarice, to the better and the baser passions
of our nature, which may draw to her very effi-
cient aid m her conflict, and will probably cairy
her triumphantly through it. But I cannot per-
suade myself that the contest will not be renewed;
and that Mexico will make no effort to reduce the
rebellious province, and íestore the State of Texas
to the confederacy If she should not, it will be
one of the most extraordinary facts in the history
of human society, and in the separation of States
and nations. It seems to me incredible, when I
reflect on the previous condition of that province,
I on the effects which must result from quietly
yielding her independence, and on the population
I and wealth of the nation. No, sir, Santa Anna
I is not Mexico. His army was not the strength
' of that nation. She still has men and money—
Bravos and Urreas-*-and it will not be long before
we hear of them in the administration of the Gov-
ernment, and at the head of armies, advancing
upon Texas. I can found no opinion or act on
the belief that there is an end of the conflict.
But I should not have risen to express these
notions, if I had not understood the Senator fiom
South Carolina [Mi Calhoun] to declare that
he regarded the acknowledgment of the inde-
pendence of Texas as important, and principally
important because it prepared the way for the
speedy admission of that State as a member of
our Union, and that he looked anxiously to that
event, as conducing to a proper balance of power,
and to the peipetuation of our institutions. I
am not now piepared to express an opinion on
that question—a question whicn all must foiesee
will embrace interests as wide as our Union, and
as lasting in their consequences as the freedom
which our institutions secure When it shall be
necessarily presented to me, I shall endeavor to
meet it in a manner suited to its magnitude and
to the vital interests which it involves, but I will
not, on the present resolution, anticipate it, nor
can I permitan inference, as to my decision upon
it, to be drawn from the vote which I now give.
That vote is upon this resolution alone, and con-
fined to it, founded upon principles sustained by
the laws of nations, upon the unvarying piactice
of our Government, and upon the facts as they
are now known to exist It relates to the inde-
pendence of Texas, not to the admission of
Texas into this Union. The achievement of the
one, at the proper time, may be justified, the
other may be found to be opposed by the highest
and strongest considerations of interest and duty
I discuss neither at this time, nor am I willing
that the remarks of the Senator should lead, in
or out of this Chamber, to the inference that
all those who vote for the resolution concur
with him in opinion. The question which he
has staited should 0« hi* r<;rfectly 0pen and
fiee
