SAINT LOUIS, MO., April 9, 1864.

Colonel JAMES A. HARDIE, Inspector-General U. S. Army:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following inspection report of Gratiot and Myrtle Street Prisons, Saint Louis:

Commanding officer, Colonel J. P. Sanderson, provost-marshal-general Department of the Missouri. Colonel Sanderson does not give the attention he ought to the management of these prisons.

The prison fund amounted March 31 to $3,500. 93, against $5,355. 08

for February 29, a decrease of $54. 15 for the month.

The active supervision of the commanding officer is very much required in the management of this fund. I think his attention should be particularly called to the subject. No books are kept containing an account of the savings as required, and the method of transacting the business connected with it appears unsatisfactory.

Sutlers for each prison appointed by Colonel Sanderson. Sales restricted to legitimate articles, and no business relations exist with officers. No list of prices posted up.

Troops on guard at prison, daily details from Seventh and Tenth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry. I found the guard quarters dirty and the sentinels inattentive and careless. The character of the buildings as prisons, however, assures the security of the prisoners. No one has escaped from the building since February.

The health, clothing, food, and shelter of the prisoners is satisfactory. The economy and discipline of the prison should be improved. Gratiot Street Prison should be kept much cleaner, especially the sinks. The hospital I found well managed. Smallpox gradually disappearing.
