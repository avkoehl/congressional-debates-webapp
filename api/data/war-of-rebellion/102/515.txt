HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,May 19, 1865-4. 45 p. m.

Brigadier-General CONNOR,

Fort Leavenworth:

Three officers will do. Order for muster out of cavalry is suspended in your district, and the order telegraphed to Julesburg. If any such order as you mentioned is out, stop it. Have had no answer about Captain Turnley. I can send you all the cavalry you need, but no cavalry will leave your district to be mustered out until I replace them, even it if is considered best to muster them out, so you can go right ahead.

Four hundred horses leave here to-day for you. If you can find any horses in Fort Leavenworth fit for your service Colonel Potter will send them right forward.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
