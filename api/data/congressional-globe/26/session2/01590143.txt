THE BANKRUPT BILL.
The bill to estábil-h a uniform «yMem of bank-
ruptcy throughout the United States being taken up,
Mr. CRITTENDEN rose to explain its provi-
sions, but he said ha had no intention to enter ¡alo
an elaborate aigument on the subject, for, if a de-
bate were to follow, u wonld amouit to a rejection
of the bill at this late period of the sesnon    The
bill had been fully debated at the last session, when
it was passed, and a protracted debate now was,
therefore, unnecessary,  as he presumed the opi-
nions of the Senators were in no respect changed
| The bill was, in its main features, tte same as tae
I bill on which they had heretofore ac'ed, and, a'ler
| calling the attention of the Senate to a report made
! by commissioners appointed by the British Crov n,
who consisted of commi sioners in the bankruptcy
and insolvent courts, he left the measure to the dis-
posal of the Señale
Mr^ENTON rose to make a motion which
would go to te t one principal feature m this bill;
it was in relation to the manner in which cert'fi
Cites should be granted tn deb'ors when discharged
from their debts. Ti.e b II bef. re them pruvided
that the certificate snould be decreed and alio ved
by ths court which declared the debtor a bank-,
rupt without 'he concurrence of the crednors,
which differed m thai respect from the English
bankrupt ¡aw, a>3d from all bills which had hitherto
been brought into Congress on that subject, by
which the assent of a portion of the creduois «as
alwa5S reqmied. Now on tms point he proposed
to test the ¡Senate, w et^er they should itrod^ce
such an innovation as this bill proposed, and al'ow
judges to decree and al'ovv a certificate on a ease
made out almost ex parte, and wuhout th  consent
rf the cieclitors. His motion was io stuke out the
fourth section, and to insert the foity second a'id
forty-third sections of the bankrupt bill, «hci was
maiuied in the Senate in 1827, which, if adop'ed,
vvi uld make th s essen'ial d'ffereice m this bill,
that instead of the bankrupt bemg discharged b/
the ?ct of the judge withOiU the consent of the
creditors, he should not be discharged uniesson cr
tain conditions, the pnacipil on  of which wac,
that two-thirds of his creditor , in number and
amount, shoull sign ihe certinc'te Wnh respect
to tiie precise number he was not particular, but ho
was desirous tha' some certain numuer of Ihe
eieditors should as ent tnerelo He be'iev.d this
powci was du> to the ciediior, it was a power
winch Congress thould not undertake to
take away; indeed, it was one of the great
fundamental pnrciples of the bankrupt bill,
which had not hitherto, either in this couatry
or in England been departed from, that the credi-
tors should control Ihe issuing of the certificate,
and he (Mr Benton) looked >ipon it that under
our Constitution, which prohibited them from im-
pairing the o iligttion op contract tis y ought not
deprive die creditor of the jast right hehal exi"-
ci^ed in such oses undei ímilar law 3 What
could be ot j *cted to sach a provision' Would
it be said that the c-e'iitors woul'* be hard hearted,
and that, therefore, they would w.thho d the ce"l -
fieate from a poor debtor who had become so by
nusfor'une, or improvidence even? Such an ar-
gument was contiadictpd by experience, which
tiught them that where there w?s fairness on the
part of the deb'or to s'ards the creditors, there was
almost uniformly generally to the impoverished
and honest debtor on the part of the ered tors It
bad been the practice lor the debtor and the cred -
tnrs to meet together, and where tb" debtor showed
hiiii'-elf to be hon ¡>tly indebted, eni unable to meet
h s en^ageneiit>, v e wai released, and he (M* Bev
ton) h°U then lhat thc.e ^7¡^s nothing in ihe argu-
ment that creditor? were heard hearted, to object
to the substitute which he oilertd He the-efoie
moved to strike out the fourth -ection, and insert
the seeuons he hid mentioned
The S^cre'ary having read t! e sections proposed
to be introduced—
Mr. HUNTINGTON conca r d wi'h his f lend,
the Senator from Kent-ieW, that ,r this bill wv; to
be debated section by se-ti"n, it must be obiimis it
could not be passed His own Slate (Connecticut)
had very litt'e mtertst n th s bill, yeihe must be
permitted to say that he had several fbieciions lo
the amendment of the Senator from Mi^soum It
■vas a perfect'nomaly in all judicial proceedings to
require in such cases not only the intervention of a
court, but also of tv o-th,rds of the creditors By
the fourth sect on of this, bill, which it was now
piopc^ed to strike out, there was amp'e security
provided for the bona fide credit™, the qjestion of
fraud was determm^b e by a court, and why «-hou'd
the consent of two thirds of the cred tors be íe-
quired, vhen acourthsd dei<-rmmed ihe debtor en-
titled to his di charge' He could not see why
this peculiar privilege should b  given to cieditors
m this case, moie tb?n in anv odies when (hey had
the opportunity to bring the debtois before a pioper
tribunal He saw no repson whatever to place
such power in the hinds of creditors. He objec ed
to vest creditors wi h the power to m'erpose an un-
just rffusal to the discharge of honest debtors, be
had also other objections, but as the measure had
been fully debated at the last session, h« would no'
now detain the Senate.
Mr. HUBBARD had considered this bill, and
had prepared a mo'ion wh.ch he bad intended to
submit to the Senate, bat he presumed the Senator
from Missouri had given to it the consideration
wmch it demanded, and, therefore, he should not
interfere with the honorable Senator's amendment.
The honorable gen leman from Connecticut said a
perfect anomaly was involved in that amendment.
Now, wnat was the proceeding to wbie'? the amend-
ment referred' A bankrupt was about to be dis-
charged from his liabilities to his creditors, and the
bankrupt was allowed to take his own time, and to
make his o.vn prepirpticn, and to make thj decla-
raUoa when it suited hi-, own convenience, and j
thf creditor  ¡nterpoied, the Senator from Connecc
ticut said it was an anomaly'
Now, in every bankrupt system with which he
[Mr Hueeard] was acquainted, it was incorpo-
rated, ana why should it not be so now2 Had not
every "ent'emm's experience warranted him in
making ihe declaration, that where there was one
creditor that refus-d to discharge a debtor, there
were ten dishonest debtor^ that sought to impose upon
an honest cedaoi' He wao willing and desirous to
give security to the honett debtcr, but he would not
lose si^ht of the hopest creditor. His Sta'9, (New
Hampshire,) would, perhap , be as h ile affected
by a bankrupt bill, as any other—as yet neither he
nor Ins colleague had received a smqls memorial
or remons'rauce on the subject—but when they
were legislating in this matter, he hoped tbey
wou'd preced with due care, and not palm a one-
sided bill on ihe community, and neglect to pay a
due regard to th* inteies's oí credi'ors. Of what
earthly benefit was this fomth section to ihe credi-
tor? What earthly prcttc ton would it afford
them? Toe «hole bill (rom ihe first to the last was
a lili ior tne exclus'v benefit of the debtor, and it
did ni t regard, si he vi wed it, th  interest of the
ereditor He rejoiced that the honorable Senatir
f-om Missouri hid b'o-iiiht forwird hi'proposition,
and he (Mr Hosbiko) tbould cad for the ayes
an 1 nres ihereon, but he t, j tet, in saying what he
had now said, he should not De accused of being
unmindful cf the unfortunate del tor.
Mr NORVEI L hoped the amendmeut would
not be adopted He would rather *ee no bankrupt
bill pass than a bill w.th such a clausp as that pro-
posd by the Senator from Missouri Tne section of
the Confutation to vhic'ithe S >aitor from Mis-
souri referred, prohibited 'he S ates impairing the
ob'igation of contracts, an 1 d d not militate against
their power to pass the b 11 as it was introduced.
He regrA'ted to see gentlpmen so much hehi id the
age in which they lived in reierenc? to subjects of
Pii-, kind, if t ey kept equal pice with the people,
tbey s lou'd at once do whit ju tice, andmeroy,and
humanity called upon them io do
Mr CRITTENDEN said the bill provided that
if the creditors dissented, it should afrest the judge's
grantn g a ceitificate, and tbe matter was to be put
upon tnal, and if i were 'hen determine 1 that the
debtor was a lontij d' ton!rapt, tbe ju 'ge should
grait ¡hu cerli'icat , without the concurrence of
the crédito s But it was nos" proposed so to alter
it as to m?k- t-ie cous nt ot ,he ce iitors indispen-
sable in all cas-i. Now ibe mischievous conse-
qaeiices uf such power being vestel in the credi-
tors w s shown in the report of the British com-
missioners, to which he Had before referred, and to
an extract from that report he beg«d to call the at-
tention cf the S n<ite. Having read the extract-
Mr WKIGHr su"gested a modification of the
amendment of the Senator frjm Missouri; his
impression was that s msj ti y of the creditors was
saffici ! t,ai,d he hoped his fr end would substitute a
majority ¡or tv-o thirds on whose consent ihe cer-
tifica'e should be granted I' he underslood the
question then before ihe Senate, it was a very íra-
poi tint on". The State L-gislatures, by the Con-
Vitutioi, couid not cancel the obligation of con-
trae'", and t^e question presented to the Senate
vt as, on what condition they would do ¡Ú Should
it hi entirely without the concurrence or ac-
tion ot the creoi'ors ' And if so upon
what principle would they prcceed. Why-
was the pppaal made to them now' If he un-
derstood it, it was that a man may have a great
many creditors, and may compound with all but
