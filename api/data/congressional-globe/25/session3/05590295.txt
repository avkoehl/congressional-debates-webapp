recently that those of a smaller size could be cast
of a good quality. Mr. Ames, proprietor of a
private foundery, has succeeded with the latter,
and Mr J believed that the propuetot of the
foundery near Boston has recently cast those of
a small size that have stood the test required by
Government.
Mi N. P. Ames, the proprietor of a brass
cannon foundery, and perhaps one of the most
practical and scientific artisans in this or any
other country, in a letter to a select committee,
dated January 31,1839, m answer to sundry ques-
fons, makes the following sensible answer
Washington, January 31   1839
Sir I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
jour letterot tlws date, in relation to a national foundery
in answer to your first inquiry, * Would a national
foundery be u efrd for the purposes of Government?" I
would say that I believe one might be made so I am sen
sible of the import uice of experiments in establishing new
patterns aud testing different materials, and 1 think it
would be well for Government to have the power to de
termine, definitely, what is best for the public service A
founderv would iflord facilities for investigation that might
prove valuable to the public interest
111 answer to the second mauirj, ' Might not a foundery
be established without detriment to pavate establish
ments? ? I should think it would not necessarily be detn
mental, Imt t íght be useful There would undoubtedly be
manv experiments made at a national foundery that would
not be pioposed to puvate individuals, and beneficial results
mi^lit anse, directly or mdirectlv, through such expert
mi nts On the other lnnd if a national foundery should
be made so extensive as to reduce the business for private
establishments to an amount that would not make it an
object foi entci prising individuals to engage m it, C think
Hi public as well as private interests might be injured, for
I believe the mcentivi tor improvement in manufacturing
«pennons is generUlv grelter where private th in where
public interest only is engaged and without the influence,
directly or mdirectlv, of private establishments, unpiove
ments m public establishments would be likely to be lun
itcd
Jt is therefore, my opinion, that a national foundery
should be established only on such grounds as would ena
ble the public laid private inleiests to subset ve each othei
The bu-iness of casting cannon might be taken entirely
from individuals, as it depends only on Government lor
support In this respect it differs materially horn most
3ther branches of business
in answer to the last inquiry, " What resion of country
would be most eligible for a foundery >" I am not preparí d
foi an opinion Convenient water communication ind
water powei would, in my view be among the mist im
poitant considerations in selecting a situation
Í am, sir, very respcctkilly, youi obedient servant

TotheHon  WilliamC Johnson, Chairman of the found
eiy Committee of the House of Rejiresentalues
Such were the views which he (Mi J ) had
always entertained on this subject, that, so far
fiom a national foundery injuiing, it would teally
aid private mteiests, and would place the Gov-
ernment beyond the influence of combinations or
impositions of any kind. What is there now to
ptevent a sagacious enemv employing a seciet
sgert to purchase the puvate foundenes, and
then, in time of war, closing them upon the Gov-
ernment J
European Governments are more wise and sa-
gacious in this respi ct Every prominent Gov-
ernment of Europe lias a national establishment
for casting cannon
The following statement was furnished the
committee on that pait of the Piesident's mes-
sage which related to the establishment of a na-
tional foundery for making cannon for the use of
the Army and the ¡Navy It shows the mode
used in Europe foi supplying each nation with
'his indispensable mean:, of national safety and
protection

cannon are cast In Prance there are three foundenes of
brass cannon—at Douar Toulouse, and Stratsburg, and
two of iron cannon—at Ruel, near Angouleme, and at St
Gervais, in the south of the kingdom In Denmark there

When at Cairo, I visted and closely examined the various
establishments and institutions founded and supported by
the Pacha Within the walls oí the citadel are a manufac
tory of bin ill arms, pistols, and sabers , a foundeiy for brass
artillery, casting, turning, and boring the two latter both
eflected at the same time and by the same power, contl„u
oils to the boring room is the manufactory of field carriages
and caissons, oí which there were a number completed,
with artillery and howitzers mounted ready for service, all
of exceeding good and handsome workmanship
I next visited alumaceand michinerv for rolling sheet
copper, and a manufactory of sheathing nails and spikes,
conducted bv an Englishman
AtBoulie a suburb and the port of Cairn is a new and
extensive furnace and founderyfornon ordnance ind every
species of casting, very recently established having three
large iron hearths and a steam engine , all the m ichinery
English Hereafter, all the ordnance for the lotts and ma
nne will be manufactured at C uro, as have been the field
artillery and small arms for two years
We are behind the age in improvements in ma-
chineiy and implements of wai and national pro-
tection There is no establishment when Gov
ernment can satisfactorily test the utility of
modem improvements with complete and ready
facility
About two years ago Mi Cochran, the inventor
of thecylindncal small arm and cannon, informed
him (Mr J ) that, failing to be patronized by this
Government in the lattei, he sought the eounte
nance of the Grand Sultan, and by the aid of lus
Government he tested his invention in the pres-
ence of his highness in Constantinople But a
few days ago a citizen of this city was expressing
to Mr J his mottiiicauon that he could not test
an invention of his upon a cannon, which he had
tued with gieat satisfaction upon small fnearms,
to pievent the " escape of the power of powder
from the touchhole " No individual has ord-
nance , they are sei viceable alone as national prop-
erty
Can any mind of ready perception for a mo-
mentdoubt that a mighty revolution has not only
commenced, but has alieady been effected, in
maritime warfare' Steam has not only been made
auxiliary to wind and tide, butpioudly to tnumpli
over both, and to leave, smuggling with the ele-
ments in its wake, the tardy canvas which has
whitened the seas like things of air for a thou-
sand years The poet's highest imagination of
othei days has fallen short of modern genius,
who never dieamt that steam would press the
swift car moie than fifty miles an houi, and that
the propelling wind would be too feeble for the
quick impulses of the piesent age, when he said
sails would be used on land

[Paradise Lost
The swift steamship, with its dreadful imple-
ments of destruction, will have the tendency, he
could hope, as he believed, of lessening, from lis
very power of destruction, an appeal to aims by
the civilized nations of the globe Its sudden in
cursion on the defenseless city, the secunty of
those on board, and the destruction of those as
sailed, will give but little gloiy to the successful,
and no disgrace to the unsuspecting and suipused
citizens of the consumed citj
The martial pomp of the tented field, the ght-
teung livery and the waving plume, the very 10-
mance and poetry of chivaliy will be destroyed,
and the ambitious will, fiom these causes, cease
to aspue foi mattict glory, became it will not be
acemded by tie slaughtet of his fellow-beings
Skill and courage will give no advantage And
when war is lobbed of those attabutes, the warm
enthusiast for distinction will seek it in other pur-
suits He must seek it in acts and deeds of
moral and intellectual improvement and superior-
ity, in ameliorating the condition of mankind,
rattier than in the sanguinary profession of arms
He, for one, believed in the improvable condi-
tion of the.human race, and that much higher
perfection is yet to be attained in civilizing, in
moralizing, and refining the most improved na-
tions of the world The generous, the benevo-
lent, and the philantropic had still abundant and
arduous labors to perform m thatbioad and end-
less field of improvement
But, then, he maintained, this or any other ra-
tion, to pi eserve that peace so desired, mml be «tier
ready to defend its rights and protect its interests and
its honor The best way to preserve peace in this
age, and perhaps in ages to tome, is to be formid-
ably prepared for war. We must regard man as
he is, and not as he may be, or as we could fondly
hope that he should be
He had digressed somewhat from the object
and purpose of his remaiks, and would now ask,
what was our condition on the ocean' Marty of
our ships are unfit for sea, and after an expend-
ltuie of more than fifty million dollars, we have
but few superior vessels of-war The South Sea
explottng squadion was delayed undir the pre-
text of lessening the number of vessels, when it
was pioposed to send butfoc. It at last, after
two yeais' delay, sailed with six vessels, and will
be inoffensive, in any emergency, under the Ex-
ecutive proclamation, for thee years, even in the
eventofawai The committee may íecollect that
a bill was hurried thiough this House last yeai
to oiganire a cortsi squadron, for the piotection of
our merchant vessels, when a "daik, piratical
looking vessel" was supposed to be hoveling on our
coast That single "magic ship at sea" eieated
moie concern m Congress t/t<z?i the whole naval
powet of England has at the present time But the
Secictary ot the Navy has informed us, at the
opening of this session, that he has been unable
to effect the intention of Congress, "owing to the
want of proper vessels at the disposal of the De-
paitment After supplying the necessities of for-
eign stations, the steamship Fulton is the only
one now available for this service " Ihen the
steamship Fulton is the only vessel now available
to proti ct our merchantmen along a coast of some
fifteen hundied milet m extent We ore far, very
far, behind the age in steamships We have one
yes, one national steamship Have England,
France, and Russia, but one each > England has,
he believed, about fifteen; Fiance a like number,
and Russia some eight oi ten *
An advantage in an eminent degree would re-
sult to the «ountry from a national foundeiy in
testing, by the fullest experiments the best met-
als and combinations of metals, so as to impiove
the tenacity of ordnance to resist heavy piessures,
in order to prevent explosions and reduce as much
as possible, to be safe, the weight of cannon for
field trains and for the naval service Most of the
oidnance of the Government is totally unsafe for
service, and nothing can cieate greater dismay in
time of action than the explosion of a gun

ing cannon of the best materials, Commodoie
