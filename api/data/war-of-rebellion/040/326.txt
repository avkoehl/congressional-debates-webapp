Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863-2 o'clock.

[General BUTTERFIELD:]

From character of information have suspended attack. The enemy may attack me-I will try it. Tell Sedgwick to keep a sharp lookout, and attack if can succeed.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863-4 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Your dispatch received. Copy announcing suspension of your attack sent Sedgwick. He and Reynolds remain quiet. They consider that to attack before you have accomplished some success, in view of the strong position and numbers in their front, might fail to dislodge the enemy and render them unserviceable at the proper time. They are anxious to hear from you. Six guns Horse Artillery sent to Banks' Ford this a. m., as directed. The balance of Graham's just ordered there. The enemy are sending nothing from here now to their left. I allow nothing to go to Washington and say nothing myself. Is O. K.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD.
