session for. debate.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. I desire,
with the consent of the House, to offer a reso-
lution, not for action at this time, but to go
over until to-morrow.
The SPEAKER. Under the order of the
House that cannot be done at this time. But
the gentleman can now give notice that to-
morrow he will ask leave to submit a resolu-
tion.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. Then I
will give notice that to-morrow, on the return
of the House from the Senate Chamber, I will
ask the House to take a recess until seven
o'clock, in order to allow members who choose
to make speeches an opportunity to do so with-
out reference to any action of the House, but
in order that those speeches may be published
and sent to the country.
Allow me to say one word in relation to my
reason for doing this, so that members may re-
flect upon it. It is now very plain that the
Senate will not allow the managers on the part
of the House to speak and lay before the pub-
lic the reasons which they may have in support
of the impeachment of the President, except
so far as those who have been selected for that
purpose may do so. And it is believed that
there may be some advantage in laying before
the country the reasons which they have.
I have, therefore, deemed it right to give
notice of my intention to offer the resolution
of which I refer, merely for the consideration
to the House, not for its action at present;
aud I give the notice at this time in order that
members may have until to-morrow to reflect
upon it and determine whether it would be ex-
pedient to make such an arrangement as I have
suggested, in order that speeches maybe made.
I know there are four or five very able speeches
written, not by the managers only, but by others,
on the subject of impeachment. Whetherornot
it would be prudent to make such an arrange-
ment is a question for the consideration of
members. J give this notice now in order that
I may not bo concluded to-morrow from sub-
mitting the proposition to the House.
The SPEAKER. By the order of the House
no business can be transacted this afternoon
cxcept that of which notice was given; that is,
the introduction of bills and joint resolutions
for reference merely, in order to accommodate
members who have bills which they desire to
get before committees for consideration.
The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Wasii-
burxe] and the gentleman from Massachusetts
[Mr. Banks] have already given notice that
to-morrow, on the return of the House to this
Hall, they will endeavor to get the House to
dispose of the pending resolution in relation to
the printing of Manager Butler's argument,
and then to have action taken on the bill in
regard to the rights of American citizens in for-
eign States. The Chair would therefore suggest
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Ste-
vens] that Friday would bo a better time than
to-morrow for an evening session.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I would
inquire of the gentleman from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Stevens] if he proposes that the man-
agers shall make their speeches to the House
instead of to the Senate?
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I was about to make the
same inquiry. It looks as if it was a proposi-
tion to make the arguments hero in the House
before the case is closed in the Senate.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. All I can
say to the gentleman is that it looks very much
now as if the trial were fast approaching its
close. I have already said that I have given
notice of this proposition as a precautionary
measure, so that I may not be precluded from
offering it to-morrow or next day if I choose
to do so. I am not sure that I shall offer it.
Mr. VAN AUKEN. I desire to inquire of
my colleague [Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania]
whether the object of this proposition is to
forestall the action of the Senate in regard to
how many speeches shall bo mado in closing
the impeachment trial ?
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. As I un-
derstand, the Senate has decided that matter.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I call for
the regular order.
The SPEAKER. The regular order is called
for, and the pending question is upon ordering
the main question on the resolution reported
from the Committee on Printing relative to
the publication of the argument of the gentle-
man from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butler.]
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Mr. Speaker 
The SPEAKER. No debate is in order,
the pending question being undebatable.
Mr. ELDRlDGrE. I do not wish to indulge
in any debate. I simply desire to ask of the
Committee on Printing that they shall report
the resolution I offered with reference to the
publication of the argument of Judge Curtis,
so that the House may act on the matter.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I did not
call the regular order for the purpose of cut-
ting off that proposition.
Mr. ELD RIDGE. What I desire is that
the House shall act on the two propositions
together. Unless this be assented to, I shall
feel it my duty to require the presence of a
quorum to act upon this question. If both
propositions be acted on at the same time,
there will be no objection on this side of the
House.
Mr. MAYNARD. The chairman of the
Committee on Printing [.Mr. Lafi.ix] ig not
now present.
Mr. CULLOM. I move that the House
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the House
(at four o'clock and ten minutes p. m.) ad-
journed. _____
