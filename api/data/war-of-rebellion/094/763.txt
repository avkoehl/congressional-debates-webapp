Major J. P. STRANGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: In obedience to orders from General Jackson, I have the honor to report my position at this place. The raid reported moving in direction of Columbus had gone toward Moulton, Ala.; Roddey and Holman in front of them. There is no forage in this vicinity; I can't feed my horses here. the nearest corn is at Smithville, seventeen miles south, on Aberdeen road. I hope I will be permitted to leave here very soon.

Respectfully,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.

Major STRANGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I hope the general will keep his promise and furlough my men as soon as possible. They are nearly all now within a few days' ride of home. I hope he will grant about thirty days, in order to give them time to recruit their horses, many of which are broken down and need rest, but are good.

Respectfully,

F. C. ARMSTRONG,

Brigadier-General.
