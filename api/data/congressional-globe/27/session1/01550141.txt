Order being restored,
Mr ARCHER, proceeded wi h his lemarks on Mr
Rives's argument Though he had cwsideted himself
the stongest party man m the United States and had come
here with a wmn de ire to support this Ad nmistra
tion, first because it wa? a \\ hi& Vd ministration an 1
next, because it was a Virginia Admmi-üaüon, yet if his
colleague was to be consideied the expone it oftht vieW3 of the
Administration as to the powerscf the Constitution, he muot
enter his solemn diss nt from them Ltc consideied them
directly opposed to the doc rmes oí the old \1r21ma school ot
* politicians He then ad veiled to the Adtmniatra ion of Genei il

had been pi orno ed, and bowe 1 the knee to tin  detested idil
He chaiacteiizel the expunging act is infamous and one lot
which he w uld not have given bib vote foi the possesion of
a thousand empires As to the opinions ol Ten son on the
subject of a Bankof the United states, 1 e ejpsideied them of
little value, his opinions might be found on any side ol any
question, at least they might be iound on both sidc-> of ti n
If he (Mr A )ever became convinced of the con^U uti mal ne
cecity fir the establishment of a National Bank as the fa cal
agent of the Go eminent he would go for a whole Bank, and
not lor a half a i ne is propo t d I y his, colleague which would
be a Bank of the United states m odiousne^s, but not jn

Mr RIVE-  replied to Mi Archer with much animation
He regretted n ueh the exhibition made by his colleague, in
which he thought he had unnecessarily tiavellel out o! the
way to make an attacK upon lam He had always thought the

might be imagined at the unexpected attack made upon him
this mom ng by his colleague
Mr ARCHER disclaimed all feelings of personal mil md

Mr P then proceeded to say that if gentlemen called upon
these charters as giving them the power of distribution, they
must take the rule whu h the deeds themselves prescribed__
and what was that? According to 'the'* íespective propor
tons m the respective charge "of expendnuies " What was
the in amnsr of that ^ Loul 1 we ut tlerfitand it under the pre
pent "ystem^ No We must go back to the period of the
adoption of the grants They were made previous to theadop
t on of the Con titution they were made under the articles of
Conf°deri ion We all knew that under the Confederation,
Congress had no powei to tax but they meted out to the
States in certain propoi tions, their ratio of the general expen
itures bom the pub ic treasury, and left it to the States to
íaise the income oi produce (he revenue It was in fact, under
the articles of Confederation, a system of btate taxation And
when we looked back to them, we could understand the mean
ing of the woids "in their respective pioportmns, according
to the general expenditure," &c They weie general charges
Mis nbuted among the tota tes, according to their respective
^federal p pulation In that proportion the States had to con
tiibute to the public treasury This was the rule laid down
by the giant, antl he called upon those who- intended to vote for
this bill to execute that rule
Mr P trenargu d tl at the adoption of the Censtitution of
the United States ha 1 changed the whole power it enabled
Coneae-ss mst acl of the c-ates to lay taxes Those taxes were
col ected from the people, and the provision in the grant was
effectually destinyed and nullified by the adoption ef the Con
stttution and no btate, not even Virginia hetseif, had a right to
cumplam if she had modified and chat ged this power, shcher
self bein" an assenting party to the Federal Constitution
But if the gentleman claimed to ihstiibute these proceeds un
dei the oidmance of 1/94 how did he claim, under thatordi
nance, to divide ten per cent imong the new States, over and
above their original shaiesi Neither the gentleman from Mary
land, nor any one else could claim to distribute under the grants
without being s rictly controlled and limited by the grams them
selves
But the oidmance of 1794, and the other grants of the chffe
rent fetates were confined to lands upon this side of the Missis
"ippi particularly the land from Virginia—that vast territory
which lies between the Mississippi and the Ohio, and which
wds no*hme, hteialiy a diop in the ocean anddustm theba
lance—compared with that immense domain that stretched it
self beyord the Mississippi to the waves of the Pacific On
inference to document ,joQ page 38 gentlemen would find what
w is the t umber of acres of the public land remaining to this
Gover uncut [Mi P here rea Ian extract showing the amount ]
And if t! e ff ndtmar fiom. Mu y land c aimed to get this bill
I js=ed undei the Tints of the different States, it must be con-
fined in its operations to a very small portion He could not
claim to distubutc the-Ian 1 which was acquired by purchase,
and which was rail for out of the common revenues of this
C tvernment I was ruhcuions—wor=ethan ridiculous, it was
