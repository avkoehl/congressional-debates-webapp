Major-General ROSECRANS:

This is a favorable time to commence work on the Northwestern Railroad. The Government, no doubt, will replace the iron belonging to the road which it has used. The force necessary is a guard. Its construction need not be large. The labor and money necessary can be readily obtained. Your authority for its construction, whatever agent you may select, is all that is necessary.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I received telegram from the President last night that the appointment of Colonel Gillem as brigadier-general had been ordered. Please notify me when you move forward; I will go with you. Would it not be well for the East Tennessee forces to be put in shape to enter that country when there is an opportunity to do so?
