Headquarters, June 27, 1863.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Maryland Heights:

Hearing a day, or two ago that General French was to take command of Harper's Ferry, I countermanded my order for your stores, supposing you would not want them on Maryland Heights.

Be on the alert, and prepared for all defense along the road at every point. The enemy are reported at Gettysburg, and may send cavalry to the railroad.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

General Couch reports the rebels in possession of Gettysburg, and moving east, 5, 000 strong. I expect to-day or to-morrow to hear of the Northern Central Railroad being cut. I directed Colonel Rodgers to defend block-houses and stockades on my part of the line to the utmost. I have completed nearly all my line of defenses around this city, but have few guns for them. My infantry outside of the old forts are the Sixty-ninth New York, 462 men, and the Fifty-fifth New York, 210 men, with three small companies of Second Eastern Shore. Total, about 800, and all raw. My cavalry are out as scouts on all the roads. The rest of my troops were sent, as ordered, to Monocacy, and are there or on the march.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK.

I have no troops whatever that I can send to the Conowingo Bridge.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

Rebels reported by telegraph operator destroying Northern Central Railroad at Hanover Junction, 46 miles from here, and 11 miles this side of York. Do no know, but suppose it to be as yet only a small cavalry force.
