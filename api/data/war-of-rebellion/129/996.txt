Respectfuly returned to the President.

I can see no objection to the temporary assignment of this court for the State of Mississippi, and under all the circumstances I recommend such assignment.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL;

Is not the cavalry corps formerly commanded by General Lee now in Mississippi under General Taylor? It seems to me better to assign the court either to General Taylor's corps or to the division of cavalry in Mississippi rather than to make a temporary assignment.

In response to your resolution of the 2d ultimo, relative to the impressment of slaves, I herewith transmit a communication from the Secretary of War, which conveys all the information I have on the subject.

The PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES:

SIR: I have received a resolution of the House of Representatives relative to the impressment of slaves, adopted on the 24d instant, a copy of which is herewith inclosed.

The superintendent of conscription, to whom the resolution was sent for report, furnishes in his reply copies of the orders issued by him on that subject, but states he is not in possession of the information demanded.

Copies of both these letters are herewith transmitted, and furnish all the information at the command of this Department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES A. SEDDON,
