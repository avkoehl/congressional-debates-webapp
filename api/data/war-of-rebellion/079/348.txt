The paper of the 13th contains the following dispatch from Forrest:

CHEROKEE, ALA., October 10, 1864.

Generals Rousseau and Thomas are following me with about 12,000 men, and organizing to cross here. I have still 500 men on the north side of the river who have gone to the hills. I think them safe. Three gun-boats and four transports came up river to-day as far as Eastport and landed 2,000 emn and three pieces of artillery. Kelley drove them back and captured their artillery.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

If Hood goes to Blue Mountein I would ike to take two DIVISIONS and strike out for Macon and Milledgeville. One DIVISION in our new works, with all our surplus artillery, can hold Atlanta, and I believe I can go through the State with two good DIVISIONS. I can get a new outfit of horses and mules and damage the enemy seriously by destroyiling the railroad, &amp;c., even if I fail in capturing either Macon or Milledgeville. I am positive they have no force in this section of the State except I verson's cavalry. Let me try it. I will return if I beocme satisfied I am hazarding too much.

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
