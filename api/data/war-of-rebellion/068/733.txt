HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Chancellorsville, Va., May 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I wish to make the following report of my position: My lines extend from Todd's Tavern, Furnaces, Dowdall's Tavern, Ely's Ford, United States Ford, Banks' Ford, the road to Fredericksburg, and patrol 6 miles down the Telegraph road. The lines are very much extended and I cannot spare any more troops to accompany trains to Belle Plain without endangering trains at this place. If the general commanding desires any change in my position I should be happy to hear from him. I would like to know the exact position of our troops at the front that I may be able to conform with their changes.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. FERRERO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

May 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General FERRERO:

Your letter of this evening is received. I inclose you with this the position we will hold to-morrow morning.* The only fords necessary to hold will be Ely's and United States. Dowdall's Tavern is far enough west for you to picket; you can give up therefore the guard at Todd's Tavern and Banks' Ford. No more troops need be taken from you to guard trains, and those sent already you may send for to return. Communicate this to General Burnside, commanding Ninth Corps, through whom it would be sent but for the delay that would occur in so sending it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General

P. S.-The black lines on the map show the position of our troops.
