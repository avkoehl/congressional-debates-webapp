HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,September 13, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE:

GENERAL: Under orders from General Early I directed Wharton to go back to his old camp. General Early said that he wished Gordon still to remain in position, and would send word when he could be returned to his camp. If there is no demonstration on your front he might come to camp at dark.

I am, general, respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF WESTERN VIRGINIA AND E. TENNESSEE,Dublin, September 14, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, &c.:

GENERAL: The department return which I made to-day does not show the organization of the different brigades in this command, nor have I yet been able to make myself entirely familiar with all of these organizations, so confused has everything bee, and so difficult has it been to procure returns of the proper character from the commands. I have ascertained enough, however, to know that the various organizations are very defective and must be changed to be made efficient. I will recite the history of two of the brigades, and earnestly ask the attention of the authorities thereto, with the request that my suggestions may be adopted, satisfied that the interests of the service will be thereby promoted.
