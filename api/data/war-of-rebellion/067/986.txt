No. 248. Reports of Brigadier General Edward Ferrero, U. S. Army, commanding Fourth Division.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Miller's House, on Plank Road east of Alrich's, May 15, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that at 12.30 p.m. this day the Second Ohio Cavalry, stationed at Piney Branch Church, were compelled to fall back, being attacked by superior forces, consisting compelled to fall back, being attacked by superior forces, consisting of one brigade of cavalry, with two pieces of artillery. I immediately ordered the Fourth Division in readiness, and marched the Twenty-third U. S. Colored Troops to support the cavalry. On arriving at Alrich's, on the plank road, I found the Second Ohio driven across the road, and the enemy occupying the cross-roads. I ordered the colored regiment to advance on the enemy in line of battle, which they did, and drove the enemy in perfect rout. Not being able to pursue with infantry, the Second Ohio formed and gave chase to Piney Branch Church, which they (the Second Ohio) now occupy. All quiet elsewhere. Our loss amounted to about 8 or 10 wounded. The enemy lost some 5 horses killed. I have changed my position to a more secure one, to protect the trains and roads leading to the army. I have since learned from one of my scouts that Hampton's brigade is in full retreat, in perfect disorder, toward Todd's Tavern.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. FERRERO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Salem Church, Va., May 20, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that I was attacked by a strong force of cavalry and artillery at 5 p.m. last evening. At the same time heard heavy firing on my left and rear. The enemy were defeated in their attempt to break through my lines. Captured several prisoners belonging to Ewell's corps. I have given instructions for all trains proceeding [to the front] to take the Massaponax Church road. I would suggest that my lines be drawn back closer to Fredericksburg, as my left is too open and I have not troops enough to cover the extent of country intervening between Salem Church and Massaponax road. I await orders with reference to this change. I would add that we are constantly menaced by the enemy, both in small and large parties. The amount of cavalry that I have,being about 700 men, is insufficient to do the duty.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDW. FERRERO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff.
