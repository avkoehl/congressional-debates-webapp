nurses, cooks, and orderlies at the hospitals at City Point, and the medical officer in charge of the hospitals at that place will at once make requisition upon the corps commanders for musicians to relieve the able-bodied men of their commands now employed on hospital service, and the latter on being relieved will be returned to their regiments. Each corps commander will select an efficient officer to take the general charge of the musicians of his corps assigned to hospital duty, and he will also, on the requisition of the medical officer in charge of the hospitals, furnish his proportion of a detail for a hospital guard. The guard will be no larger than is indispensably necessary. The requisition on corps commanders for hospital attendants and guard details will be in proportion to the number of men of the corps under treatment.
