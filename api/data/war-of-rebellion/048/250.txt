GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Numbers 96. October 15, 1863.

The major-general commanding announces to the army that the rear guard, consisting of the Second Corps, was attacked yesterday while marching by the flank.

The enemy, after a spirited contest, was repulsed, losing 2 colors, a battery of 5 guns, and 450 prisoners.

The skill and promptitude of Major-General Warren, and the gallantry and bearing of the officers and soldiers of the Second Corps, are entitled to high commendation.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I beg leave to inform the general commanding that his order expressing his approval of the conduct of this corps on the 14th instant is received with enthusiasm by officers and men. If I may speak for the corps, I will say that it is satisfied if it received no other praise than his, and is ready to perform its part of the plans of the commanding general in the future, as has done in the past.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
