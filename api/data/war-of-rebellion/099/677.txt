GENERAL: Your note just received. I will try and have the scout ready for you. I would rather make short marches, if you do not object, on account of supplies, than to halt for General Slocum.

Cheraw, S. C., March 4, 1865.

The attention of corps commanders is called to the fact that the foragers are in the habit of destroying or rendering useless the mills along the line of march and frequently burning large quantities of grain which are of great necessity for the use of the army. Last night a large quantity, over 1,000 bushels of shelled corn, was destroyed by the unauthorized burning of store buildings in this town. The general commanding desires that for the safety and comfort of the army some measures be taken to prevent the continuance of this destruction.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:

Captain A.m. VAN DYKE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to suggest, for the consideration of the commanding general, the propriety of releasing the prisoners we now have belonging to the South Carolina militia, old men and boys, on their parole and oath not to serve against the United States during the war. They are now but a burden to us, requiring an issued of subsistence when it is necessary to husband our supply, and can scarcely be looked upon as fir subjects for imprisonment or exchange.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Major-General.
