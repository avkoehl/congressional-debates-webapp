last DIVISION of your corps. Direct your ordnance officer and commissary to make requisition on this post for whatever supply of ammunition and commissary stores you will need, and I will give direction to have them sent you promptly.

DECATUR, October 31, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General STANLEY:

Elk River Ford is about fourteen miles from Athens, and an excellent position to hold the enemy if the comes toward Athens. I will forward to you the new regiments sent me from Nashville as soon as transportation can be furnished.

Major-General STANLEY:

The cars are off the track, and trains cannot go forward until train is removed. Mr. Bruce, master of transportation, has the matter in hand.

(Received 6. 30 p. m. November 1.)

Major-General STANLEY:

Do you want the re-enforcement from here immediately? I cannot get transportation for them, as there is a train off the track at the junction and an engine down the bank. It will take them five hours to march from here to Athens. Shall I send them overland?

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General STANLEY,

Athens:

The enemy last night and to-day crossed a large infantry force at and above Florence. They are reported moving on the Huntsville road; also toward Lawrenceburg. It is impossible for me to determine which direction their main force will take. I will furnish you all the information I can get promptly.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General, Volunteers.
