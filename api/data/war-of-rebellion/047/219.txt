Honorable W. PORCHER MILES, Richmond, Va.:

Thanks for those heavy guns. If I complete my circle of fire, Gillmore cannot come within it. Battery Wagner is good as ever. Enemy still working hard on their batteries.

Works at Savannah should be placed in order for bombardment. I need slave labor there. Governor Brown advises impressment as the only means, and I apply for the authority.
