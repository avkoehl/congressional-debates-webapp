we may remain hereabouts until his return develops the truth as to the numbers and position of the enemy. General Rosecrans thinks General Johnston has been quite largely re-enforced. A forage party from the First Division was attacked this morning; result not yet ascertained.

Very respectfully,your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS, Winston's, September 7, 1863-4 p.m.

[General SHERIDAN:]

Remain where you are until further orders. We have no news of the enemy, save that a large body of cavalry came up on Lookout this morning, attacking a lieutenant and 10 men, about 1 mile in front of our picket. They killed 1 man and captured 3 others. Wheeler's command, and I think all their cavalry, is over in Boomtown Valley. Stanley goes over to-morrow and of course, will have a fight. I will do all I can to help him. Forage at this point is not plenty. Two or 3 miles below they have plenty. I have no additional [news]. Keep me posted as to all you know. Davis is at Winston's with one brigade on the mountain. Johnson is at the base of the mountain, at the point he descended, 7 miles from you and 3 from here. I will send you the news to-morrow as soon as Stanley makes any. God speed you.

Truly, yours.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
