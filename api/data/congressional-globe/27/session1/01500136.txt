fell from him. the other day in bib defence of the
Secretary of State m relation to this quesuon He
(Mr B.) would merely bay, however, that he had
not that confidence in that officer which the gen-
tleman from Virginia seemed lo have. He thought
that the history of the la(e war wouli show that
there wa^ good reason for believing t ¡at the pre-
sent Secretary of State was not the best deposuoiy
of the honor and character of thib country There
was a time when he sued for peace.
Mr. PB.OFÍTT called Mr. Brown io order He
inquired of the Chair whether, during the convide
ration of the present bill, it was m order to enter
into a •personal attack upon the Secretary of Slat-,
impugning his patriotism an j honor If the mem
ber from Pennsylvania was indulged in this wan-
ton and unjustifiable departure fiem decorum, he
(Mr P ) would repel the slander He felt able to
answer not only the member who his uttered it,
but any man who would make a^ ms nuatio*
against ihe probity, the honor, the noble patr ousm
of Daniel Webster.
Th« CHAIRMAN reminded the gentleman
from Pennsylvania that he was departing Irom ihe
subject under consideration ih discu s ng the ques-
tion of war or peace.
Mr B. continued. He was showins the impro-
priety of abstracting money trom the public Trea
sury at a time like this, when it was wanted to put
the country in a state of defence Ht then went
on to express his regret that the gentleman fiom
Virginia [Mr Wise] had lent the sancuoi  of his
name in tavor of the Secretary ol States letter lo
Mr. Fox, and also to remind the House of the re-
commendation of General Washington—that in
time of peace the country should prepare for wai
And with regard to the public lands, he would say
that we were givmg a Urge amount ot land aw iy
in addition to what had already been given He
had a regard for the new Sta es, but he confessed
he had a higher for tne interests of the people oí
Pennsylvania Apart from the general bad cha-
racter of the bill, there were particular leatures ol
marked injustice, and none more than that which,
while it proposes an equal distribution, gives t>
the new States millions of acres of land more than
they have already had, and ten per cent m addi-
tion on all sales within their borders Thus, while
it is said the General Government holds the entire
lands in trust for the States equally, it undertaken
to give to Ohio a much larger share than Pennsyl
vania—takes from tne trust tund of the one, and
gives it to the other This Pennsylvania would
never submit to; if she is to have ar y, she needs
and will require her full share. Her publio im-
provements, for which she was greatly m debt,
were of more benefit to Ohio than to herself, and
if either should have more than the t ther, it was
Pennsylvania that had the better c'aim.
Mr B next adverted to the division of the sur-
plus revenue among the States, as having led, in
many instances, to other extravagant expenditure',
and particularly in Pennsylvania, where it had
been one of the causes of her present enlarged debt,
and asked how was the sum thus abstracted from
the Treasury of the United States to be supplied?
We are told by increased duties, and, (or the pur
pose of tickling the public ear, we are told that
these duties are to be imposed on "wine , and
silks, and other luxuries " But this wasadelu
sion. The increased duties on wines would only
bring into the Treasury some two or three hundred
thousand dollars, and silks perhaps a million and
a half of dollars, while the greater amount of re-
venue was to be derived trom duties on tea, sugar,
and coffee—not luxuries but neeessa íes of lue,
which duty would take indirectly from the pockets
of the people, and particularly the poorer c!assrs,ten
times as much money a* tne distribution of the sales
01 the public lands woald put in Before he could
allow such a bill as this to pass, fae must be bo#n
clearly that the people of Pennsylvania vvoud be
the sainers by it and not losers

Mr BROWN went on to observe that gentle-
men were < ften influenced by mo ives th°y them
selves did not know of, but, for himself, he was
cons rained to believe that the bill was nothing
ehe bul a movement designed to ben fit corpora-
tions, io aid the credit of State nocks, and to f ir
nish to brokers the means of speouhuon In tead
of looking to tne public in erest, it was a mere
seheme to raise the value of certain stocks in the
market, and make the firtune of 3t*ie creditors,
bank directors, and British, capitalists It ws
meant to tell anion  the Sngh h mtney lenders, by
shewing them tliaf, though this Government dw
not directly and openly assume 0 e debts of the
Staler, (and fvm this he should not much wonder
to see propo ed, for the genbeman fiom Georgia
had deelared himselt willing to do it in part, and
when a man, oi a wo nan eithei, was willing to do
a thing in part, Mr B was very apt to expect that
he would soon be willing to do it altogether,) jet it
would o "gtnate and carry through an mcip ent
me sure that looked to that, ind would ¡n pait
effect it, by ramng the eiedit and increisn'* the
v lue of State stocks So far as th* United States
Government wis eumerned, it was no matter what
was the value of the slock of the S'ates Pennsyl
vania looked to her own resources to meet h?r own
1 abil t es, she did not atk this Government to piy
her debts. What was it to that Govrmment
whether her Stale securities weie ?t 50 or 100 per
cent in the market? She was abie to pay trie m
terest on her debts, and the Government had
nothing 'o do win the matter Yef here was a bill
to raise her credit, fo distribute to her a portion of
the proceeds of the public lands Ii could have
no other object m view than to enable the States to
engage in new objects of interna! .mprovemen1,
plunge themselves into new debts, brmg m vast
amounts of foreign merchandise, against the inte
rests of our home industry, and then, if we had
nothing to export in exchange, to liquidate the ba
lance by exporting gold and silver, and thus to lead
to a new suspension by the bank* That was th 
rou me things were likely to take.
Besides, ti «• Secretary of the Treasury, m his
report, -.p ke abou' an appro chug r-Vivai of
commeict-, sa^ <sbjiU the present burciens bem 
removed from tie neeks of the peofle, and yet in-
die very same decament, he proposed ¡o ncrease
then burdens by laying a duty of twenty p r cent
on articles now free of duty He oi' net led Co ,-
gross how the burden was to be relieved, proba-
bly by the increased import*, ion of Bntis1- manu-
factures, and then where would be t ie pro ectiuii
to our owa manufdc ure s Was ceminercc to m
crease, more goods to b ■> impor ed, and at the same
time more goods to be manufactured at home'
The world, ii seemed, w„s to be enab'ed to con-
sume our productions, but where was the consump
tion to take place' Where was to be the new or
increased demand for the produce of our soil, our
mme^, or our labor? Would it open a larger
market for our C'tton and tobacco to lay duties on
foreign w nes and silks'2 If not, where was our
increased market to be? Were we to pay our
foteign debts by a new creation of millions of Na-
tional Bank stock? He supposed that new debis
were to go over the watei, and then we must go
through the same scenes we had witnessed within
tt-e last few years. We snould import vast
amounts of foreign products, and when "we had
consumed them all we should then find ourselves
left with a heavy debt on our shoulders, and would
hive to scrd out our bard dollars to pay the inte-
rest abroad, when we had been getting two hun-
dred millions' worth of the m  nufar-tures of Eu-
rope, we must tend out cotton and tobacco'and
our flour, to ihe amount of twenty millions a year
to m«t t our engagements Tne state of matters
wa^ changed He supposed the Secretary's revi-
val of commerce was to be effected by our new
loans ard new dut e  In less than five years we
shoulifind the country five hundred millions in
debt, and have nothing io show for it but a mass of
direct taxes on the soil and en the industry of
our own pe pie To such a state of things the
bill tended It was a bill to destroy domestic in-
dustry, ruin the currency, and debase the public
morals. He hoped the majority would look well
to it, and remember that there was a voice beyond
the walls of that chamber, and that voice they
must obty The gentleman from Georgia had
said that he (Mr B ) was ready to pounce upon
the Bank the moment it should be made. So he
was and it ms voice was unavailing in that hall,
he would go to the people he would again plant
among them the standaid of popular rights, and
his hie for it, the people of Pennsylvania would
respond to the call ol liberty till tney made that hall
echo again He would counsel the majority not to
forget or to betray the interests of American indus-
try and the prosperity and happiness of their coun-
try, to promote the interest oí American stockjob
bers, or Bnush American bondholders
Mr. GILMER of Virginia next addressed the
commitlee He would not attempt, m the discus-
sion of the question, to go into a consideration of
the history of the public lands, he would not at-
tempt to examine the process by which they had
been acquired and held, or were disposed of. These
were topics pertaining more to history than to the
business of toe House Suffer*me, however, (said
Mr G ) to say, as a Virginian and a Representative
of Virginia, that, so far as he past history of my
own State is concerned, there is no part of it which
a Virginian can look at, either now or on a future
day, without sentiments of proud satisfaction.
Whatever may have been the mode of acquisition
of that vast territory which was once held and then
ceded by Virginia to this Government, whether by
charter from tbc British Crown, or by the superior
right of conquest under that patriotic hero, George
Rogers Clarke, ihe pert of impartial history will
never fail to do justice to Virginia. We are satis-
fied with the past, our anxiety is only as to the fu-
ture It will be conceded that the lands now held
by the United States have been acquired in two
mo íes either from voluntary acts of cession made
before the adoption of the Federal Constitution, or
by purchase, made wita the funds of the United
States slice 1787 At the time the lands were ce-
ded to the Confederation, the Constitution had not
been adopted, and none of the powers, or but few
of them, wh'ch are now exercised by. this Govern-
ment, could at that time be exerted by the Confede-
ration In particular, it had no revenue powers,
but had to depend entirely upon the ac ion of the
States, whom it Lad no means to coerce The
country had just passed through the struggle of the
Revolution, an cnornijus deb ha 1 been contracted
as the price of the public liberty, and it was neces-
sary that it should be provided for before the Con-
stitution should be adopted The faith of the Con-
tinental Congress, the faith of each of the Slates,
the faith of every American citizen was pledged for
its discharge I take the ground, iherefore, that
the great motive which prompted the States
holding large amounts of public land to eede them
