APPENDIX m THE COHGK«SSl€>NALi©LOBE.
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Maim, Bomdary Question—Mr, Buchanan.
Senate.
Used, denied the assertion made by Mr. Fox and
Sir John Harvey,of the rightof the British Gov-
ernment to exclusive jurisdiction over the dis-
puted territory by aa agreement, either express
or implied, and set up and demonstrated a clear
understanding between the two countries which
was wholly inconsistent with the existence of
any such agreement, and entirely in conflict with
any such exclusive jurisdiction.
The second resolution justified the conduct, of
Maine through this whole affair, maintaining that
ehe ought to drive out trespassers on the disputed
territory, and that it was not reasonable cause of
offense to the British authorities
The third resolution went as far as possible,
consistently with What was due to the British
Government, in asserting the rights of Maine to
the disputed territory, because it asserted that, if
New Brunswick or Great Britain should persist
in maintaining exclusive jurisdiction by force of
arms, in that case the exigency under the Con-
stitution and laws would have arisen, in which
it would be the duty of the Piesident to call out
the whole force of the country to protect the prop
erty in the disputed territory.
And what was the fourth resolution ' Was it
not apparent, even fiom what the Senator from
Maine had said, that this resolution was neces-
saiy? Mr B would nqt now enter at all into an
examination of the conduct of Mame. But she
was a biuve and gallant State, and her feelings of
hostility were gieatly excited Was theie not,
therefore, danger that, with ten thousand men at
her command, she would rush into a conflict with
tht New Brunswick or British authorities The
fourth resolution, therefore, could do no less than
declare that, if Su John Harvey should first with-
draw his forces, then, in the opinion of the Uni-
ted States Government, Mame ought to follow
such an example of forbeaiance, and that, if she
did not, then this Government would be under
no obligation, after having done everything it
could for Mame, to afford her any pi otection un-
der such cncumstances, nor ought she to expect
it The fourth resolution simply defines our own
position, and says that the Constitution and laws
impose on us no such obligation as to protect
Maine while pursuing a course contrary to the
advice of this Government. If we adopt only the
fiisttluee lesolutmns, they will be all on one side,
and will lead Gieat Britain to believe that we are
ready for war at once
And what is the argument of the Senator fiom
Maine? Sir, I was at a loss to conceive what
motive a Senator fiom Maine could have in at-
tempting to dispiovt this satled agreement And
what reason does he assign foi even a wish that
it mishtnotexist? He says the negotiation may
stilt be pending foi years, and Mame does not
want this undeistanding to be interposed between
her and the possession of her terntoiy
Mi WILLIAMS I did not say we did not
desire this understanding to exist I only stated
an objection to it, as heie stated Tne resolution
affirms the agreement to be so and so, when per-
haps it is still to be a subject of negotiation
whethet it is so or not, for the Bntish Govern
ment is but too ready to hang negotiation on any
piacticable point that may possibly turn in then
favor
Mi BUCHANAN Su, did not the Senator
from Maine and others repiesent it as a great
hardship that, under this agreement, they could
not entei into the disputed terntoiy and settle it'
And if they should do so, the peace of the country
would be endangeied, and this understanding is
the only barner m the way of Mame to prevent
hei from taking possession of the disputed terri-
tory. Sir, are we prepared for such a course
which must inevitably and at once bring us into
open collision with the Bntish Government? For
myself, I am prepared for that event if it must
come, but I would pursue the course of honor and
of right to the end of the controversy, and then,
if hostilities must come, we may be a united
people, and entei into them with energy and suc-
cess I piesume the Senate are unanimously of
the opinion that if Gieat Britain persists in as-
seiting her claim to exclusive jurisdiction over
the terntory, war is inevitable. And yet this is
objected to by the Senator from Maine, because
it contains an affirmance of the right of Maine.
And why does he object to this^ Because we
have made this affirmation a year before, is there,
can there be any objection that we should again
affirm it? And yet on this ground the Senator
ob|ects.
I  regard to the claim to exclusive jurisdiction
on the part of Great Britain, the Senator attempts
to prove that there is no understanding on this
subject, and for that purpose he goes back to the
original correspondence, and presents from that
a claim set up by Great Briton, which was de-
rogatoiy to our rights and degrading to the na-
tion And what was that claim ? That we were
to hold the United States—their soil, their inde-
pendence, their existence—not in virtue of our
own good swords, not hi virtue of our independ-
ence, declared and achieved by our moral, intel-
lectual, and physical energies, but as a base con-
cession from England; and, therefore, as it did
not appear that England has conceded to us the
possession and jurisdiction of the disputed terri-
tory, it was consequently not ours. And how did
the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Clay} meet that
degrading and insulting claim at the time ? He
met it with the highest honor and with irresisti-
ble triumph And now the Senator goes back
to that degrading claim, and follows up the tram
of events to 1832, when he ought to have begun
precisely wheie he left off. And why? Because
the state of things was entuely changed in 1832,
when the award of the King of the Netherlands
was rejected by the United States Senate, at the
instance of Maine, and Mr Livingston then pro-
posed the present understanding, and made it as
manifest as language could make it And what
is it? That, while the negotiation is pending,
each of the two parties should confine itself to
rights already possessed, and to this Sir Charles
Vau^han, in the most formal manner, gave his as-
sent; and it is the only possible principle on which
the peace of the two countries can be maintained,
because there is no hope of settling the contro-
versy if eithei paity has a light to rush on the
disputed terntoiy, and assert its possession and
junsdiction without any piescribed limits Some-
times this agieement has been attempted to be
violated, but in every instance, as I hope they
will also m this, the Bntish authonties have de-
sisted fiom carrying out such violations
[Mr B heie rend fiom the Picsident's mes-
sage an account of various cases in which Eng-
land had renamed, when opposed, from extend-
ing hei rights and junsdiction in the disputed
terntoiy ]
Su, 1 hope this settlement will come soon I
do not say we should wait forever, and if Eng-
land persists in her claim to exclusive jurisdic-
tion over the disputed terntoiy, all America will
be united, and she will be successfully resisted.
But if, on the other hand, this unfounded claim
should be uithdiawn on the paitof England, and
Maine hei self should persist in the same violation
of this agieement fiom which England forbears,
there may be war, doubtless, but the country will
| be divided Sir, if there must be war, let it be a
national war, and let it be on the side of right at
every step, so that thete can be no question about
it And however I have been continually the
i advocate of Maine, and nevermore than at this
moment, yet I am unwilling that any of the indi-
vidual States should compel us in our course, and
foice us to go to war Sir, I believe I have re-
deemed my pledge, and in a manner which I hope
will be satisfactoiy to the Senator from Maine
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, said he wished to
say a few words m addition to what had been
urged by the Senator from Pennsylvania, but
rather for the purpose of assuming the proper re-
sponsibility which belonged to him as a member
of the Committee on Foreign Relations than with
a design to enforce the views of that Senator
Mr President, (said Mr C ,) as far as the Pres-
ident seeks to preserve the peace of the country,
as long as he can do so consistently with the
honor and interest of the country, I will support
him all I can, and these íesolutions are now
brought forwaid for the preservation of the peace
of the country. The most important of them aie
the two last, of which the third declares that if
the British authorities persist in asserting their
claim to exclusive jurisdiction,it will be the duty
of the United States then to recognize this state
of things as an invasion of die territory of the
United States, which demands, if necessary, the
entire force of the United States to repel it, and
after that to afford protection to the territory in
question The Secretary of State and the British
Minister have concurred in the terms of an agree-
ment, and if Sir John Harvey does not pursue
the course indicated by that instrument, but per-
sists in his avowed determination, and goes on to
maintain exclusive jurisdiction over the disputed
territory, the consequence will be war, and <hen
I shall be prepared to go with the Executive^ and
wage that war with the whole power of the United
States.
The last resolution (the fourth) looks to the
contingency in which the country may be pre-
cipitated into a War by the State of Mame, and
It therefore declares that, if the British Govern-
ment should desist from asserting a right to ex-
clusive jui isdictien over this territory, and should
withdraw their forces, and if then Maine will not
do so on her part, but makes war for herself ra
the maintenance of her right, u  such case that
resolution declares, what it is impossible for any
citizen to deny, that the United States is not
bound to follow Maine into that war which she
wages not only without the concurrence, but
against the most earnest interdiction of the Gov-
ernment of the United States The resolution
does not declare that even then, in no possible
contingency, will the United States not come to
her relief, but simply that the United States will
not stand bound to give such relief, and that, if
there is wai, it must be by the common consent
and the common Government of the United
States
Sn, I presume this fourth resolution involves
a proposition from which it is impossible for any
Senator to dissent This is a Government of
twenty-si\. States, while Mame is but one of
them. Of all the powcis of the highest nature
and character which come within the scope of
human authority,that of wans the highest which
can be exeicised by the sovereignty of any coun-
try, and, as it respects Maine, no one can con-
tend that the power of war does not reside exclu-
sively in this Government. After looking on all
the papers that have been placed before us on this
subject, it is my opinion that Maine is so en-
raged, and justly so, at the conduct of a boider-
ing province, that she may precipitate us into a
wai, which can only be prevented by that for-
bearance on the pait of Maine which is recom-
mended in this resolution, in which will be
uttered the decision of the Government at Wash-
ington m a tone with which there is no doubt that
the Pieswent will concur. I therefore give my
entue concunenee in the views of the commitee,
cxpiessedin the fourth resolution, that if Maine,
on her own íesponsibility, from her own re-
scouices, and contrary to the entreaties of this
Government, plunges into a war, we are not then
bound to follow her, and to repair to her relief
with the military power of this Government
But I hope she will forbear fiom coming into any
actual hostilities against a province thus at peace
with the United States.
Sir, I desne no other war than what we have
already seen Still I knowenough of the resources
of the country, and of its valor in a war with any
Power, that if we have a just cause so that the
approbation of Heaven may fall on my country-
men, I fear not the results But when we have
a war, I want to see that it is the result of dire
necessity, and to see a prevailing conviction in
the country that negotiation could not pievent it,
and that it is a war not of Mame acting for the
Confederacy, but of the twenty-six States united
in its prosecution with their utmost vigor, and
then we shall gather fiesh laurels and gam addi-
tional renown for the country I know that Maine
complains of the tardiness of the negotiation, and
there is cause for it, but it is not right that she
should take the reins into her own hands, but she
shouldactmoderately,andindangeianddifReulty
it is her duty to operate with the Government
here. I think theie has been neglect in rcgaiil to
this subject, and I remarked, on a former occa-
sion, that when the disturbances in Caí ida arose
it was a time to press this mattei, but 1 knew of
no attempt to press it during that time It is now
, upwards of a year since the coipmencenent of
