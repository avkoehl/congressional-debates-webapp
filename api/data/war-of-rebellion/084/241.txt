HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., July 18, 1864.

Colonel TYLER,

Commanding Pilot Knob:

Hildebrand's band of fifteen men are reported, on what I regard as good authority, as prowling about Big River Mills and Lawson's Station. They are supposed to come from Illinois, above Sainte Genevieve. Have Milks to go out to find and kill them, whether found in Illinois or in this State. Instruct commanding officer at Farmington to go to work and, if necessary, strengthen the force for that purpose. This band is reported as having been prowling about there for a week, to the great alarm and disquiet of the people. They must be routed out promptly, and if possible exterminated.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General BROWN:

Colonel Ford has been ordered to force Thornton down toward the river. Make dispositions to secure Independence and Kansas City. General Curtis will be required to give you some aid.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General BROWN:

Ford telegraphs that he has good work north of the river, but that the affairs in his sub-district require the return of his troops. It cannot be done just yet, but Fisk has just been telegraphed to return them, as Thornton has passed far enough east for the Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry at Glasgow to get hold of them. Communicate to Ford. The general says he has secret information that the rebels are meditating a raid on Jefferson City. I communicate it, although he may have done so before. If you find such an attack imminent, and have not enough of troops to spare from other points, you will have to take them off the post. All reports agree that Thornton and company are getting roughly handled.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT LOUIS, July 18, 1864.

General BROWN,

Warrensburg:

Telegram received from Ford that Todd, with 150 men, is threatening Independence. You may authorize him to withdraw about 120 of his men from the north side of the river. Cannot he get enough of his men who are on the south side of river together to dispose of Todd's band? If he can do it without taking any from north side it would be better.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
