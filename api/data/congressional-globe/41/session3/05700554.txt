strued to include, canal-boats employed in nav-
igating the canals within the United States,

rolled or licensed for the coasting trade; and

navigation, management, or use of canal-boats
in the con,ting trade shall by reason thereof
be entitled to any benefit or relief from the
uiuiine hospital fund.

from a foreign port, fifty cents; for the clear-
ance of a vessel to a foreign port, fifty cents ;

ury, and ferry-boats carrying passengers and
their personal baggage only, shall not be re-

empt ecitain boats from the payment of marine
hospital lees, and for other purposes, I have exam-
