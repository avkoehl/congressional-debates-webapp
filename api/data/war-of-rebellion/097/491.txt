were moving to the support of the people we fought yesterday, were thrown in front of us to protect the crossing of the rebel trains over the Appomattox. If we had had more daylight I am satisfied we could have forced the enemy in. It is evident they have works, or at least heavy batteries, on the north side of Appomattox. The enemy shelled us with heavy guns from the other side. Please inform me as to where our infantry is? I have sent out to make connection with it, but have heard nothing as yet. I suppose my right flank is covered by its position. Gregg did not get up till after dark. I tried to send Mackenzie on the road to the right of the one we marched on, but he could not get over. Please communicate soon.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.

Major WEIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: I have just received an order from Captain McGonnigle, acting chief quartermaster Middle Military Division, to send all the ammunition wagons of the Cavalry Corps to the Five Forks and park it there at once. Is an escort necessary to accompany them? If so, who will furnish it? General Smith informs me that he expects to have his brigade relieved in a few moments. I presume you will see that a suitable guard is provided for the ammunition train while in park. The rest of the train is ordered to remain at this point until further orders. My headquarters will be with this part of the train.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORATIO C. KING,
