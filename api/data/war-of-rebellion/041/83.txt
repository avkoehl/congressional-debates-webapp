Landing (our depot for supplies) to a point on that road where it connects with the Bayou Sara road, and about 1 mile from Placion Church, near Barnes' Cross-Roads. Communications from the telegraph station near the Cross-Roads were conveyed to their destinations by orderlies detailed for that purpose by General Augur. The line was in good working order until June 5, when I was directed by the chief signal officer to turn my wire over to Captain Bulkley, of the United States Military Telegraph, for temporary use, and the same to be worked by his instruments. Up to the time of writing, the wire remains in his possession.

I inclose copies of a few messages only, as it would require too much space and time to give you complete files of all transmitted. The following shows the operations for each day so long as the wire was worked by my instruments:
