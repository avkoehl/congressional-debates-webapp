But the withdrawal of Cooke's brigade to Norton Carolina immediately after the repulse of the iron-clad fleet on April 7, of Brigadier-General S. R. Gist and W. H. T. Walker's brigades and light batteries about May 4, reduced my force materially.

The department is aware of the circumstances under which this reduction of the troops took place, and int his connection I beg to refer to my letter to the honorable Secretary of War of May 10, and to General Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General, of June 15 and July 20, 1863.
